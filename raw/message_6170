I absolutely disli=\r\nke about those\ndivide and on this backdrop i am giving my views.\n\n***\n\nMy v=\r\niews are based on Devanagari script in which we find Sanskrit\nlanguage writ=\r\nten.\n\n***\nFirst let me take GANAPATI. I agree to your views.\n\nIn Sanskrit l=\r\nanguage which is always found witten in Devanagari script,\nTa & Tha are dif=\r\nferent consonants and obviously their pronunciation is\ndifferent. and as Ga=\r\nnapati is always *found* written as &quot;GanapaTI&quot; and\nNOT &quot;GanapaTHI&quot;, The pro=\r\nnunciation of  &quot;TI&quot; is correct one which is same\nas it comes in &quot;MaTI&quot; or &quot;=\r\nBhranTI&quot; or &quot;SaTI&quot; etc... to pronounce as\n&quot;Thi&quot; in Ganapati is definately I=\r\nncorrect.\n\n***\n\n[&gt;&gt;&gt;In my observation, most North Indians, replace &quot;S&quot; with=\r\n &quot;sh&quot; and\nwrite Lord Siva as Lord Shiva and also=C2 refer to him as &quot;Shivji=\r\n&quot;.&lt;&lt;&lt;]\n\nGood that you came out with this point. that was also my one of the=\r\n\npending point w.r.t ponunciation.\n\nHere i disgree. In My opinion, &quot;SHiva&quot; =\r\nis correct Pronunciation where as\n&quot;Siva&quot; is incorrect one.\n\ni just finished=\r\n reading Durga SaptaShati. Take &quot;SaptaShloki Durga&quot;.  It\nStarts with &quot;SHIV =\r\nuvaach&quot;. It does not mention &quot;SIVA uvaach&quot;.  in the\nsame 7 verses, we have =\r\n&quot;...SHUbham dadaSI&quot;. now it is vey clear that SH\nin Shubham AND SI in dadas=\r\ni are diffeent consonants and should have\ndiffent sound assigned. so for co=\r\nrrect reading, SHUbham should be\npronounced as SHu as in SHobha and dadaSI =\r\nshould be pronounced as Si as\nin ManaSi, VaranaSi etc...\n\nTake one more exa=\r\nmple. &quot;SHive Sarvartha Sadhike...&quot; Consonant in SHive\nand Sarvarth are diff=\r\nerent. hence SHive is correct in the first word and\nit is incorrect to pron=\r\nounce it as SIve.\n\n***\n\nPlease think over the above and give me your views.=\r\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Nagraj Kota &lt;=\r\nnagraj_um@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Utpalji,\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; For the letter &#39;ta&#39;, in =\r\nGanapati, it should be the softer &quot;ta&quot;, like\n&quot;lata&quot;, &quot;pati&quot; and so on, and =\r\nnot like &quot;katha&quot;, &quot;atha&quot;, &quot;vyatha&quot; and so\non.

It is indeed one of the cornerstones\nof Sanskrit that a conson=\r\nant cannot exist by itself and its life is\ngiven by the Vowel. But for what=\r\never reason in Hindi they mostly avoid\nending vowels. They carry that habit=\r\n to other languages as well and\nrecently I heard one of the North Indian bh=\r\najan singers (I don&#39;t know\nthe name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bhaja Govindam a=\r\ns &quot;Bhaj govindam, bhaj\ngovindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, which sounded =\r\nquite odd to me! And\nthey take that approach to languages like Braj Bhasha =\r\nand Avadhi as\nwell. For instance, for them &quot;Ramacharita Manasa&quot; is more imp=\r\nortant than\neven Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also without=\r\n proper\nvowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that, that approach=\r\n is\nincorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana\n&gt; &gt; Saroja\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; raja&quot; should be pronounced exactly like that and not like &quot;Sri\nGurucharan=\r\n saroj raj&quot;.

If you change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by\nadding a vowel sound=\r\n at the end, it becomes two aksharas. This increases\nthe number of aksharas=\r\n, changes the chhandas and changes the meaning\nalso. You may still experien=\r\nce something when meditating on the mantra,\nbut you will never experience t=\r\nhe mantra to the fullest with that\npronunciation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aksha=\r\nra means &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana\n(life force) of an ak=\r\nshara. If you have just a consonant without a vowel\nafter it, then it has n=\r\no praana. It is kshara and NOT an akshara. It\nperishes. For example, if you=\r\n pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (without adding any\nsounds to it), you cannot sustain =\r\nthe sound and the listener cannot\ndecipher what exactly you pronounced. It =\r\nhas no life force.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;=\r\nyaat&quot; is one akshara.\nBecause &quot;t&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply joins =\r\nto the akshara\n&quot;yaa&quot; (which has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and becomes p=\r\nart of that\nakshara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one letter (one guru=\r\n). When\nyou pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is difficult for the listener to=\r\n know\nfor sure whether you said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible =\r\nif\none listens carefully, but otherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a\n=\r\nvery quick and abrupt transient sound without praana. So it tough to\nhear c=\r\nlearly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This makes people add some vowel to it (like &quot;u=\r\n&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot;\nor &quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in between them) so that t=\r\nhe &quot;t&quot; sound\ngets a praana and becomes clearly audible. It suddenly becomes=\r\n an\nakshara and the chhandas changes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Probably, some bi=\r\ng teacher started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as\n&quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana o=\r\nf itself and becomes very clear to\nhear, so that his students would not get=\r\n confused when learning.\nProbably the students thought the mantra was &quot;yaat=\r\nu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;)\nand got used to that mis-pronunciation. Probably, th=\r\nat became a standard\npractice after a couple of centuries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not change it\nto &quot;paat=\r\nhthu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant and\nleave it there.=\r\n You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be added at the end.\nThe same thing hold=\r\ns for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWhat I said about words ending in consonants applies to all\nconsonants and =\r\nnot just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly encountered.\nThere can be words t=\r\nhat end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also, people\nnormally add an artifici=\r\nal vowel sound at the end and end up changing\nthe chhandas and altering the=\r\n flow of energy in the mantra. That is also\nwrong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * =\r\n*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One more common mistake is the sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;ka=\r\nthaa&quot; =3D\nstory). Most south Indians pronounce this as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot;=\r\n =3D\nmoney). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha look=\r\ns\nvery similar and just one dot in the middle is different. It is possible\n=\r\nthat some people started mispronouncing this sound because of their\ninabili=\r\nty to see the dot and others started following. Now pronouncing\ntha as dha =\r\nbecame mainstream and one pronouncing correctly will be the\nodd person out.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is not English. We never have two different s=\r\nymbols\nfor the same sound or two different sounds for the same symbol. The\n=\r\nletters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different and their sounds are different\ntoo. P=\r\nronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a\nstress/a=\r\nspiration to get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In th=\r\ne sankalpa before many poojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha\nkaama moksha chaturv=\r\nidha purushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for\nattaining the purusharthas=\r\n (purposes of human existence) - dharma\n(fulfilling duties), artha (work an=\r\nd money), kaama (fulfilling desires)\nand moksha (developing detachment)&quot;. M=\r\nost people end up pronouncing\n&quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha ka=\r\nama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half\nof dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham=\r\n&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot;\nand &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a human&quot;. Mis-pron=\r\nunciation in this\nsankalpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it committed by=\r\n many many\ntrained priests!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you read Vaidika/Taant=\r\nrika/Pouranika mantras, pay\nattention to the difference between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;=\r\ndha&quot; and learn to\npronounce them differently. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; i=\r\nn the mantra,\npay extra attention to ensure that you are not confusing tha =\r\nfor dha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several ot=\r\nher mistakes (in my view) commonly made by\nmost people in the pronunciation=\r\n of Sanskrit mantras. I will be pointing\nthem out slowly in the next few mo=\r\nnths, whenever the Mother allows me\nto.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please give me =\r\nyour consideration and take my input into\nconsideration in altering your pr=\r\nonunciation (if you are open to that).\nIf you don&#39;t find any sense in what =\r\nI am saying or want to continue as\ntaught by your gurus, I can understand t=\r\nhat. I am not here to change\neverybody&#39;s pronunciation. But, because She in=\r\nspired me to share my\nthoughts with the world, I am guessing that there are=\r\n SOME who are\ndestined to change their pronunciation based on my views.

However, I have =\r\nnoticed that most of the tamilians have the habit of writing it as &quot;Ganapat=\r\nhi&quot; leaving one wonder if it is the word like &quot;katha&quot;. Their argument is th=\r\nat if you write it as &quot;Ganapati&quot; then, &quot;ti&quot; part could be interpreted like =\r\nthe &quot;T&quot; in &quot;Tea&quot;. But in my opinion it should be &quot;ti&quot;.

I have already implemented some of the recommendat=\r\nions you made, most importantly the mantra &quot;Gananam Tva Ganapatim HAVAMAHE&quot;=\r\n from your jyotish lectures back in 2004/2005! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; In the recent times I was pondering about how north Indians speak Hi=\r\nndi, where they reduce most of the words to &quot;Halanthas&quot;, like &quot;Shiv&quot;, &quot;Ram&quot;=\r\n, &quot;Krishn&quot; and so on. It is indeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskrit that=\r\n a consonant cannot exist by itself and its life is given by the Vowel. But=\r\n for whatever reason in Hindi they mostly avoid ending vowels. They carry t=\r\nhat habit to other languages as well and recently I heard one of the North =\r\nIndian bhajan singers (I don&#39;t know the name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bhaja G=\r\novindam as &quot;Bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, which=\r\n sounded quite odd to me! And they take that approach to languages like Bra=\r\nj Bhasha and Avadhi as well. For instance, for them &quot;Ramacharita Manasa&quot; is=\r\n more important than even Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi als=\r\no without proper vowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that, that=\r\n approach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Saroja&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raja&quot; should be pronounced exactly like =\r\nthat and not like &quot;Sri Gurucharan saroj raj&quot;. You may shed more light on th=\r\nis aspect as well. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nagraj &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/7/11, aswinefy2003 &lt;aswinefy2003@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: a=\r\nswinefy2003 &lt;aswinefy2003@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Re: Common Sanskrit Pronunciation Errors (Part 1)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thursday,=\r\n April 7, 2011, 11:34 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=\r\n=C2&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;&quot;If you do not like=\r\n this discussion, I am sorry and just ignore this idiot!&quot;&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear narasimha guruji &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you are doing a great job to this universe by sha=\r\nring your knwledge&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and correcting,but you are tooooo=\r\n humble!!!.Truth ia truth and what ever you are saying is also truth .no ne=\r\ned to consider yourself as an idiot&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Having devotio=\r\nn and the spirit of surrender to god is even more important. However, pronu=\r\nnciation is a factor too. Especially, correct pronunciation is very importa=\r\nnt in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mantra can stop one from =\r\nthe most complete experience of the mantra. In fact, we have a lot of peopl=\r\ne who can memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very few who can actually &quot;=\r\nexperience&quot; a mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Over the next few months, I will write my views on correct pronunciatio=\r\nn and point out some common errors. If you do not think that correct pronun=\r\nciation is important or if you disagree with my assessment of the errors or=\r\n if you do not want to change your pronunciation, please ignore my writings=\r\n on this subject. On the other hand, if you are open to changing your pronu=\r\nnciation, please give a consideration to my views and adopt my suggestions =\r\nif you find them appropriate.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nTake the &quot;t&quot; sound at the end of the words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purast=\r\naat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound inc=\r\norrectly. They change &quot;t&quot; to something like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;.=\r\n There is a reason why this corruption came into practice, but it is a corr=\r\nuption nevertheless.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/akshara. If y=\r\nou change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowel sound at the end, i=\r\nt becomes two aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas, changes the =\r\nchhandas and changes the meaning also. You may still experience something w=\r\nhen meditating on the mantra, but you will never experience the mantra to t=\r\nhe fullest with that pronunciation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Akshara means &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the praan=\r\na (life force) of an akshara. If you have just a consonant without a vowel =\r\nafter it, then it has no praana. It is kshara and NOT an akshara. It perish=\r\nes. For example, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (without adding any sounds to i=\r\nt), you cannot sustain the sound and the listener cannot decipher what exac=\r\ntly you pronounced. It has no life force.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one ak=\r\nshara. Because &quot;t&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshara =\r\n&quot;yaa&quot; (which has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and becomes part of that aks=\r\nhara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one letter (one guru). When you pro=\r\nnounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is difficult for the listener to know for sure =\r\nwhether you said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one listens =\r\ncarefully, but otherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick and =\r\nabrupt transient sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This makes people add som=\r\ne vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in b=\r\netween them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a praana and becomes clearly audibl=\r\ne. It suddenly becomes an akshara and the chhandas changes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Probably, some big teacher starte=\r\nd pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itself and bec=\r\nomes very clear to hear, so that his students would not get confused when l=\r\nearning. Probably the students thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;=\r\nyaat&quot;) and got used to that mis-pronunciation. Probably, that became a stan=\r\ndard practice after a couple of centuries.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do n=\r\not change it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonan=\r\nt and leave it there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be added at the end=\r\n. The same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I said about words ending in consonants applies to=\r\n all consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly encountered. =\r\nThere can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also, people norm=\r\nally add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end up changing the chhan=\r\ndas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. That is also wrong.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One more common mistake is the sou=\r\nnd &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce this as &quot;=\r\ndha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols =\r\nof tha and dha looks very similar and just one dot in the middle is differe=\r\nnt. It is possible that some people started mispronouncing this sound becau=\r\nse of their inability to see the dot and others started following. Now pron=\r\nouncing tha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing correctly will be =\r\nthe odd person out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Sanskrit is not English. We never have two different symbols for the same=\r\n sound or two different sounds for the same symbol. The letters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;=\r\ndha&quot; are different and their sounds are different too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in=\r\n &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a stress/aspiration to get &quot;t=\r\nh&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; In the sankalpa before many poojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha ka=\r\nama moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for attainin=\r\ng the purusharthas (purposes of human existence) - dharma (fulfilling dutie=\r\ns), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (developi=\r\nng detachment)&quot;. Most people end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; =\r\nas &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;.=\r\n Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half =\r\na human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have se=\r\nen it committed by many many trained priests!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantr=\r\nas, pay attention to the difference between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pr=\r\nonounce them differently. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay ex=\r\ntra attention to ensure that you are not confusing tha for dha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several other mistakes (in my v=\r\niew) commonly made by most people in the pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras.=\r\n I will be pointing them out slowly in the next few months, whenever the Mo=\r\nther allows me to.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Please give me your consideration and take my input into consideration in =\r\naltering your pronunciation (if you are open to that).
