At the same time, some not-=\r\nso-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine presence.\n=C2=A0\nI wa=\r\ns very impressed with the=C2=A0Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head offic=\r\ne is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamala=\r\ni (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual ener=\r\ngy in those places. There are several temples where the idol is practically=\r\n alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the=\r\n Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression =\r\nat the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.\n=C2=A0\nThere was o=\r\nne small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me t=\r\no visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi=\r\n homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that temple before and it seeme=\r\nd like a small temple. The name of the=C2=A0form of the divine Mother=C2=A0=\r\npresent there was a Tamil language name and I did not understand it. I do n=\r\not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my eyes and started medit=\r\nating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a v=\r\nery fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there =\r\nwas a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of=\r\n the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the goddess=\r\n. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof came =\r\ndown in a fire accident each time and they finally decided that the goddess=\r\n likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left\n in a hurr=\r\ny, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably kn=\r\nows the name of the temple and goddess.\n=C2=A0\nLike this, I am sure there a=\r\nre many temples with a powerful divine presence across India.\n=C2=A0\nApart =\r\nfrom the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when med=\r\nitating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure t=\r\nhat Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the underground chamber there=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nEven the middle of a busy road in India is b=\r\netter for meditating than a temple in USA. These western countries are so f=\r\nilled with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a goo=\r\nd amount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to=\r\n meditate, but my view is that there is not much left at *some* temples. Bu=\r\nt some temples are really good.\n=C2=A0\nIf one has a chance to spend a few m=\r\nonths doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nMayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tir=\r\nuvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=C2=A0and Narayana=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati=\r\n)=C2=A0in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=C2=A0and Girnar mountains (=\r\nJunagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India =\r\nand Srisailam and Mantralayam=C2=A0and Ujjain in central India.\n=C2=A0\nTher=\r\ne are many other good places, but the above come to my mind.
