He was a \nspiritually elevated soul. He believed that search=\r\n for god was the same \nall over the world through ages and believed that co=\r\nrrect answers were \nfound by great seers in various parts of the world at v=\r\narious times. As \nthese findings are often expressed allegorically, underst=\r\nanding any \nsingle version becomes tough but putting multiple versions toge=\r\nther \ngives better insight.\n\nHe studied under Sufi Islamic saints and also =\r\nstudied Hindu scriptures. \nHe put them together and tried to find some comm=\r\non ground. His \nconclusions were recorded in &quot;Majma ul-Bahrain&quot; (The Mingli=\r\nng of Two \nOceans). He detailed the similarities between Vedantic and Sufi =\r\nnotions \nof the Absolute Truth.\n\nHe learnt Sanskrit and, taking help from s=\r\ncholars and ascetics of \nVaranasi, translated 52 Upanishads, Yoga Vasishtha=\r\nm and Bhagavad Gita \n(what a wonderful and thoughtful selection!) into the =\r\nPersian language. \nHe believed that Upanishads are the book referred to in =\r\nQuran as Kitab \nal-Maknun (The Hidden Book)!\n\nHe saw this as his mission an=\r\nd spent much of his time and energy in this \ntranslation effort. As though =\r\nthis was indeed what he was born for, his \nlife ended a couple of years aft=\r\ner he finished this work. He was \npersecuted by the clergy and his younger =\r\nbrother Aurangazeb and was \nexecuted.\n\nInterestingly, his work served an im=\r\nportant purpose. Apart from laying \nfoundation for an integration of Hindu =\r\nand Muslim philosophies, it was \nthe first step in awakening the Western in=\r\ntellectual circles to the \nwisdom of Vedanta. Twelve years after his death,=\r\n a French visitor took \nthe Persian translation to France and that laid the=\r\n foundation for \nawakening European interest in Indian philosophy.\n\nHad he =\r\nbecome the Mughal emperor, which was expected at some stage, \nworld history=\r\n would have been so different. His ambitious younger \nbrother Aurangazeb di=\r\nd some machinations and won the throne finally. \nAgain, had he left Dara Sh=\r\nikoh alone and enjoyed the throne, world \nhistory would have been so differ=\r\nent. He made the singular sin of \nkilling Dara Shikoh. Dara Shikoh was not =\r\na normal soul and this Brahma \nHatya was a terrible sin. The weight of such=\r\n a huge sin was needed to \npull down a strong empire. Mughal empire fell so=\r\non.\n\nWe do not know the divine plan fully.
