I started this group a few years ago in order to share thoughts related to spirituality and the wisdom of Vedic seers. Please feel free to share your thoughts freely. We are all ignorant in some ways or the other, but what joins us is our desire to progress.\n \nAdwaita is the final reality. But the problem is that one stuck deeply in duality may not be able to come out it by merely telling oneself &quot;all is Brahman&quot;. If one looks at pleasure and pain differently, if one looks at praise and criticism differently and if one looks at different objects with a different attitude, it is because of the conditioning accumulated through many lives. It does not leave one so easily. One needs some plan to use the tools of duality to overcome duality.\n \nOne already in Hawaii may enjoy its beauty directly. But one living elsewhere may have to take a taxi, a train, a plane and a taxi before one can enjoy its beauty.\n \nSimilarly, depending on how heavy one&#39;s karmas and kaarmik debts are, one may need to engage in many actions in the world before one can become enlightened.\n \nThe same rishis who taught the final truth of Adwaita in Upanishads also taught many ways to navigate the currents of duality to reach the shore of non-duality.\n \nJust as one rowing a boat but not specifically eyeing the shore may keep rowing in the waters forever, similarly one engaged in ritual practices without eyeing liberation may keep doing rituals forever. At the same time, just as one looking at the shore intently but not rowing the boat may be stuck in the waters forever, similarly an adwaiti eyeing liberation but avoiding rituals or actions may be stuck forever simply desiring liberation and not knowing how to attain it.\n \nThe right balance is personal. One needs to engage in actions aimed at cutting down one&#39;s karmik debts and keep contemplating the Final Reality.\n \nSeveral of us perform a homam (fire ritual) as a spiritual sadhana. Fire ritual is found in many ancient religions. Unlike the elements of earth, water and air, fire is ever pure and it purifies whatever it comes in contact with. The Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e. purifier. Fire is a living god that everyone has access to. Spending time worshipping god through fire purifies one&#39;s subtle consciousness. Vedic seers (rishis) performed homam regularly, for the benefit of the world. Several detailed manuals are available at the website mentioned below.\n \nBTW, I lived in Houston during 1991-1993. I did my masters at Rice University there.\n \nWelcome again and feel free to share your thoughts.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- davydv &lt;davyd@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Hello!\n&gt; \n&gt; I am an American Hindu, living in Houston, Texas.  (Texas is in the far southern US, bordering Mexico, the country south of us, for anyone unfamiliar.)  My devotion has had its ups and downs for many years, but I am trying now to get firm in my practice.\n&gt; \n&gt; I lived near a Smarta temple in Ohio (a far northern state in the USA, bordering Canada, the country to the north of us) where I used to go to worship on occasion, and had a teacher there who was teaching me some Sanskrit and a little theology along the way.  That was several years ago.  Since moving to Texas, I have just discovered that there is a Vedanta center not very far from where I live, and I plan to go there when I can.\n&gt; \n&gt; Philosophically, I hold to advaita vedanta, worshiping Siva as Ishvara.  (I may use some words in the wrong way, so please excuse and correct me!)  I have done a good bit of reading, and meditate on a regular basis, but I do lack good grounding in some of the actual day-to-day worship and understanding of mantras and such.\n&gt; \n&gt; Having been told that this group could help me with some of that, I immediately joined.  I trust that you will forgive my ignorance on many, many matters!\n&gt; \n&gt; Davyd\n\n\n"}}
