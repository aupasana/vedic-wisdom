The=\r\n snake remains the same. It hisses, raises its hood and shows its\nfangs. In=\r\n fact, it does everything as before.\n\nThe snake charmer has changed his men=\r\ntal attitude towards the snake. He has\na feeling now that it has no poisono=\r\nus fangs. Even so, you must remove the\ntwo poisonous fangs of the mind, nam=\r\nely, `I-ness&#39; and `mine-ness&#39; only. Then\nyou can allow the mind to go where=\r\nver it likes. Then you will always have\nthe feeling of the presence of God.=\r\n\n\nYou must also renounce the attachment to renunciation, which is very\ndeep=\r\n-rooted. You must renounce the idea: &quot;I have renounced everything; I am\na g=\r\nreat renunciate&quot;. This attachment of aspirants is a greater evil than\nthat =\r\nof the householders: &quot;I am a landlord; I am a brahmana, etc.&quot;\n\nNot by shavi=\r\nng the head, not by dress, not by egoistic action is liberation\nto be attai=\r\nned. He who possesses wisdom is a real sanyasin (monk). Wisdom is\nthe sign =\r\nof a sanyasin. The wooden staff does not make a sanyasin. He is the\nreal sa=\r\nnyasin of wisdom who is conscious of his absolute nature even in his\ndreams=\r\n just as he is during the waking period. He is the greatest knower of\nBrahm=\r\nan. He is the greatest of sanyasins.\n\nPerfect renunciation is born of discr=\r\nimination. Dispassion should not be\nmild and half-hearted. It should be a b=\r\nurning flame of disgust for\neverything that is seen and that is not seen. N=\r\nothing but the state of final\nliberation is to be the ideal for attainment.=\r\n There should be no desire for\nwife, husband, children and worldly activity=\r\n. The aspirant must be encircled\nby the fence of dispassion on all sides.\n\n=\r\nAction is for the man of the world, the wisdom is for the sanyasin who has\n=\r\nrisen above worldliness.
