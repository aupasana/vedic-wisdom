You can move the coconut pieces anywh=\r\nere to facilitate their burning.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2)Almost every time some pieces are=\r\n left  unburnt, so i do not remove the remains from the kund and next time =\r\nuse it as it is and add fresh pieces of coconut.Is it fine??\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes. You =\r\ncan empty the ash and keep the unburnt or partially burnt pieces for the ne=\r\nxt homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Narayan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
