We hear of the glorious sannyasini Sulabha, the wandering mendicant, the =\r\nknower of Brahman, conversing with King Janaka of Videha. This is described=\r\n in the mokshadharma-parva of the Mahabharata. She gives Janaka profound kn=\r\nowledge of the Reality, explains to him the nature of existence and walks a=\r\nway unconcerned with matters of the world. It is told that Sulabha, the dan=\r\ndi-sannyasini, was highly devoted to the religion of final emancipation. Sh=\r\ne wanted to test Janaka whether he was emancipated or not. She finds countl=\r\ness faults in Janaka and tells him that he is only a lip Vedantin, that he =\r\nis not emancipated, that his emancipation is only a talk, and that he has n=\r\not renounced attachment. She illumined Janaka with supreme wisdom and left =\r\nhis palace.\n\nThe questions put by Gargi to Sage Yajnavalkya in the court of=\r\n Janaka mark her out as an ideal sannyasini. =E2=80=9CIf he will answer me =\r\nthese questions, not even one among you will surpass him in discussions abo=\r\nut Brahman,=E2=80=9D said Gargi to the learned sages assembled in the court=\r\n of Janaka. How bold should a woman be to question a Brahmajnani like Yajna=\r\nvalkya! Is this not a sign of absolute renunciation? \n\n\n"}}
