Th=\r\ne Maharishi replied that no\nit shouldn&#39;t be and the same will not work.\n\nHe=\r\n then narrated a story which I paraphrase: \nA king asked a similar question=\r\n of his minister and asked for\nan explanation. The minister without answeri=\r\nng the question\nasks the king&#39;s guard to arrest the king. The guard of cour=\r\nse\ndoesn&#39;t budge, in spite of repeated requests from the minister.\nThe king=\r\n gets angry at the minister&#39;s insolence and asks the \nguard to arrest the m=\r\ninister, which the guard promptly does.\nThe minister laughs and tells the k=\r\ning: See, this is the answer\nto your question, it is a matter of authority.=\r\n The same command\nwas uttered by the two of us, but only one of us had the =\r\nauthority\nto make it work.\n\nOn the other hand, we can assume that someone o=\r\nr some saint\nis our guru and we with full faith use this mantra as if recei=\r\nved\nfrom him. But then the story of Ekalavya, who did exactly this\ncomes to=\r\n mind.\n\nCan you please give your insight on this topic?\nWhich mantras do we=\r\n need initiation in?\nAre these all the veda mantras used in homams?\nWhat ab=\r\nout the mantras used in the pradhana homam?\nFor example if one is chanting =\r\nSri Suktam, do we need to be\ninitiated in this?\n\nRegards.\n\n\n"}}
