In f=\r\nact, this is a question that was raised by disciples of Sri Sri than those =\r\nthat dont know him. In fact, if one looks into it, one will be dumbfounded!=\r\n How is it that somebody like Sri Sri, who has commented exhaustively on se=\r\nveral scriptures, who is an authority on vedanta both by his inner Realizat=\r\nion and learning, who recited the Bhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old wit=\r\nhout anybody teaching him, and who gives impromptu discourses in various fo=\r\nrums across the world on all topics under the sun shy away from explaining =\r\nsome simple questions that are about his home turf?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The answer is =\r\nthat Sri Sri did not debate. He never debates on Truth! To him Truth / God =\r\nis not an article of debate. He can show the way to Realization of Truth to=\r\n those that are ready. He is not interested in anything else. He answers on=\r\nly when there is sincerity in the heart of the questioner. Otherwise he wou=\r\nld say some polite words and let it pass, however big the occasion may be. =\r\nMost of the questions that were raised in that meeting were answered elabor=\r\nately by Sri Sri in his various commentaries & discourses year ago!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; One may ask why then did he go to this meeting or whatever it was? The to=\r\npic of the meeting was something like &quot;Concept of God in Hinduism and Islam=\r\n&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; an embodiment of the v=\r\nery thing that was supposedly the topic of discussion. Those that were read=\r\ny to benefit from it from the audience would have benefited. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ****=\r\n********\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The below part is not for Rajarshi but may be of interest=\r\n to everyone, especially those among us that are intellectually curious abo=\r\nut spirituality than practicing it. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri Sri always practices &quot;exp=\r\nerience first and explanation and knowledge later&quot; principle. Sometimes in =\r\nAOL, there will be big congregation of thousands of people and Sri Sri will=\r\n only say very simple things or share some simple jokes and laughs, but his=\r\n presence would convey what needs to be conveyed for those that are recepti=\r\nve. A Master may not be interested in getting 100,000 people trading one me=\r\nntal concept for another, but prefers one sincere person opening up to Trut=\r\nh in silence. A Masters mere presence is enough for that to happen. Words a=\r\nre secondary and optional. In spiritual discussions,  the point of words is=\r\n to create inner silence or illumination and if that is not created, there =\r\nis no point in talking! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is a great privilege and an immense bl=\r\nessing to be in the presence of a living Master whether it is Sri Sri or so=\r\nmeone else. We gain immensely if we listen to them from our Being instead o=\r\nf our mind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s life, there are innumerable examples of ve=\r\nry simple people benefiting from his mere looks & presence while big intell=\r\nectuals would debate with him and miss the opportunity of a lifetime. Somet=\r\nimes when he countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna would feign ignor=\r\nance and say what would I know - I am an illiterate! What a disaster it wou=\r\nld have been for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakrishna as an illiter=\r\nate and ignoramus!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Without an accompanying experience (at least a =\r\nsmall glimpse or even a fragment of an experience) accumulating knowledge c=\r\nan be very dangerous as it will become yet another mental concept and will =\r\nactually be a hindrance to the Sadhak. Some of the most subtle and dangerou=\r\ns hindrances for a sadhak are created by none other than the sadhak&#39;s empty=\r\n concepts of spirituality and God! Things like lust, greed, anger, etc., st=\r\nand out conspicuously and are in that way less dangerous. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jai Gur=\r\nudev!\n&gt; &gt;    Siva.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi n=\r\nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail.

I occasionally visit thi=\r\ns forum. I happened to see several emails about AOL and the below email fro=\r\nm Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual practices and a=\r\ns a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want to clarify a few th=\r\nings to the extent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several =\r\npaths each leading to the destination of Sat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualis=\r\ntic, some use austerities, some use devotion, etc. AOL is a path, where the=\r\n path to Bliss is also blissful. That does not make it in any way inferior =\r\nto paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo would call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit pa=\r\nth&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly emerge into SatChitAnanda. The pers=\r\nonality of the sadhak is transformed slowly and the sadhak radiates more an=\r\nd more as they progress more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, A=\r\nOL is a seamless blend of Raja yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga=\r\n. Spritual practice in AOL is not just doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it=\r\n is commonly (mis)understood. Pranayams and Sudarshan Kriya are done for cl=\r\neansing and settling of the mind and preparing for meditation and doing oth=\r\ner spiritual practices of contemplation, Seva for rest of the day wit the r=\r\night attitude. Regular practice of Sudarshan Kriya removes / breaks old pat=\r\nterns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AOL includes some yoga asanas to prepare the bod=\r\ny (the Padma Sadhana sequence of asanas taught in DSN course and Sun Saluta=\r\ntions (Surya Namaskar) taught in Part II or advance courses fall under this=\r\n category.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The raja yoga practices include all the pranaya=\r\nms, Sudarshan Kriya, mudras, bandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living c=\r\nourse, advance courses, Sahaj samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; The Knowledge part includes deep contemplative study and imbibing of Na=\r\nrada Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat Git=\r\na. Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very elaborate commentary on all of the ab=\r\nove. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and the publicl=\r\ny available commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! Bes=\r\nides daily study of Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommended. Learning=\r\n and contemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for those that strive to bec=\r\nome Art of Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The path of AOL emphasises on =\r\nSurrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama sankeertan and bhajan=\r\ns are a standard feature of AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some wonder why =\r\nAOL charges for these courses and some wonder about lack of a Sadhguru at e=\r\nvery stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me clarify from my personal experiences th=\r\nat Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master living in Sahaj Samadh=\r\ni all times. He is capable of guiding millions of devotees in every step of=\r\n the sadhana without having to be near them in person. Several get necessar=\r\ny guidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice), some in person a=\r\nnd several via various other ways. However, to get these guidance, an inner=\r\n connection with the Master is essential. Until that stage, the various AOL=\r\n courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and in-depth commentaries on various Knowledg=\r\ne are more than enough to guide disciples to a stage where conscious inner =\r\ncommunion with Guru can be established.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several of the sen=\r\nior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis of a very high order =\r\ncapable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness at will during meditation. =\r\nThey may be not fully established in it like Sri Sri, but act as channels o=\r\nf the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and when needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept those that left their body as having a=\r\nchieved highest realization such as Sri Aurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ram=\r\nana Maharishi. However it is a human tendency to doubt them when they are i=\r\nn physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its cour=\r\nses: AOL is world&#39;s largest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL teacher=\r\ns nor its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the procee=\r\nds go to the charitable activities again run by volunteers. Many of the ful=\r\nl time teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and millions worth in =\r\nproperty to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neither=\r\n needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have went t=\r\nhrough very bad and sometimes even dangerous conditions to bring the Knowle=\r\ndge to the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs to be re=\r\nvealed to maximum number of people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Senior AOL teachers ha=\r\nve faced danger to their lives by going without any help or guidance to are=\r\nas infested with naxalites, terrorists in North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Palest=\r\nine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. with nothing but love and Divine Grace as the=\r\nir aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, money is charged in AOL courses =\r\nfor two reasons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experience showed that those that=\r\n paid for the courses seem to follow the practices more diligently. It is S=\r\nri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving person should be denied a course becaus=\r\ne they cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part of organizing sever=\r\nal AOL courses and know first hand many cases where people took courses for=\r\n free and were also provided free accommodation, etc. Whenever natural disa=\r\nster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from their own pocket or by AOL =\r\nand teach courses for free and provide healing to the victims. AOL does not=\r\n advertise it or make a show of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) This is my understa=\r\nnding and not AOl position. It removes the Karmic debt to the AOL teachers =\r\nand volunteers who still may have some doership in them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F=\r\ninally, Sri Sri is only interested in getting everyone turn inwards and exp=\r\nress the love, joy and compassion that is inside everyone. As long as one f=\r\nollows a path, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, we are happy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
