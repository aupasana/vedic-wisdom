My house is 13 km away from office. My bos=\r\ns asked me if I am confident I would reach home in time. I said &quot;Yes&quot; and s=\r\ntarted (I went on two whealer yesterday, and hence confident I could make i=\r\nt in time).\n\nNormally when I drive, I will be mentally chanting some mantra=\r\ns. Yesterday was no different. But, at some point, I was getting struck in =\r\nthe traffic and unthinking, I was telling, Oh, my God, ensure I reach in ti=\r\nme. Afterall before starting my boss challenged me if I could reach&quot;. The v=\r\nery next movement, I thought, &quot;Why am I seeking Gods help in such a small t=\r\nhing. What happens if I don&#39;t reach in time. It would be a matter of few mi=\r\nnutes of delay, and more over, I can start participating since, I had setup=\r\n a dialout to my mobile.\nMore over, this is some thing I can manage. I am w=\r\nith two whealer and can sneak in between the other vehicles. I don&#39;t need G=\r\nods help in such small thing. I can do it by myself.&quot;\n\nImmediately, another=\r\n thought came to me. Can I really manage it by myself?&quot;.Abosolutely NO.\n\nWh=\r\nile, I was correct in thinking, I should not ask God&#39;s help in petty things=\r\n, I was incorrect in assuming &quot;This I can do on my own&quot;.\n\nWhat we do, we do=\r\n by grace of God. What we do not do, we do not do by the grace of God. What=\r\n we get, we get by grace of God.\n\nThis is a movementary realisation, and I =\r\nam sure, I am back to my normal thinking. I percieve I, &quot;Vijaya Kumara Laks=\r\nhmi Narayana Rao Pingali&quot; is typing this message. unfortunately, I do not f=\r\neel I am writing this email by God&#39;s grace, even though that is the case.\n\n=\r\nSorry, if this email is out of context.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI respect you for what you are and also the homas and other things that you=\r\n do daily, I wish I overcame my procratisnation, execuses and laziness and =\r\ndo daily homams. \n&gt; \n&gt; I was just trying to put a different perspective, ma=\r\ny be I need to put it differently and so here I go.\n&gt; \n&gt; We get birth becau=\r\nse of our past actions, and Almighty God or Shakti\n&gt; in a natural way gives=\r\n us an oppurtunity to negotiate our karmas.\n&gt; Isn&#39;t that natural spirituali=\r\nty gifted by God? \n&gt; \n&gt; When we get born and have both kinds of needs sansa=\r\nric and spiritual\n&gt; Why then only ask for spiritual help only or only do th=\r\nings with a perspective of on spirituality. \n&gt; \n&gt; Just ask for all help spi=\r\nritual and non spiritual and let nature take its own course.

Like Rajarshi has mentioned, I wish t=\r\no say that many members of this list are well read. I assume that they must=\r\n have read many a books from different authors and covering many philosophi=\r\nes. I have myself read books of various sages, yogis and philosophers. It w=\r\nas not accurate when you said Vimalananda is the only saint, this list disc=\r\nuss about. This assumption was not right.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I being a gruhastha, kno=\r\nw very well, the importance of Material success, even for survival. I am no=\r\nt completely against asking for some material success while doing some saad=\r\nhana (Say Homa, Japa etc...) but i feel that it is much better, atleast for=\r\n people who engage in serious saadhana, to consciously try for reducing and=\r\n removing the thoughts of some or the other wants. If i take my example, Wh=\r\nen i started Homam, i dont remember thinking anytime about money, fame, car=\r\neer etc...during Homam or Japa. it is clear now to me that i was provided b=\r\ny Mother what i needed to survive and even better. It also happened that I =\r\nlost a good amount of money in a certain case but i never related to the Sp=\r\niritual practices especially Homam. Infact i tried not to relate any Materi=\r\nal succes or losses to Homam. though I must say here that several people wh=\r\no attended Homam with me have been benefited materially and that has instil=\r\nled faith in them.\n&gt; &gt; In my opinion, it is a very beautiful suggetion to l=\r\neave it to God to decide what is right and what is wrong, what is required =\r\nand what is not for us rather than asking or doing saadhana for getting spe=\r\ncific material result on a *Regular basis*. but that is my personal opinion=\r\n and it can differ with yours and i respect that.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My message to Ra=\r\njesh was on the same line. as i known him, i was little personal when i wro=\r\nte.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; It is to be also noted that while this group is propog=\r\nating Homam as Saadhana, it also respect other paths such as Japa, Kirtana,=\r\n Self inquiry. Narasimha and others are open in that way. What i personally=\r\n say is that do any saadhana you like but do it with regularity, seriously =\r\nand dedicatedly. Last thing i (or others on the list) will want is to be fa=\r\nnatic about one particular saint or path or God or book.\n&gt; &gt; However, i sho=\r\nuld also add here that after going through many books and many different fo=\r\nrms of Saadhanas, it is better to get the crux, select one Saadhana or Idea=\r\n to experience and stick to it. reading many books has a danger of creating=\r\n fascination for reading, generate confusions and stop one for engaging in =\r\nto Saadhana.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; On some other discussions about Guru, I sho=\r\nuld put my personal experience again. I never hanker for Finding Guru. i ne=\r\nver went out for that. Niether in Astrology nor in Spirituality. As Ramakrs=\r\nihna aptly used to say- &quot;Satchidananda is the real Guru&quot;. God is all knowin=\r\ng. i trust and relied upon. when my time was up, Guru in flash and blood ca=\r\nme.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is my habit to describe personal experiences which may or m=\r\nay not be useful. As it is in fashion to say now a days - :Igonre me as a f=\r\nool if it does not make any sense to you&quot; and also &quot;No Offence meant&quot; is al=\r\nso another popular statement. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; PS=\r\n: Raju, there is no pint of thinking as to how Homam will change your desti=\r\nny and such things. Let us review after a couple of years if anything has c=\r\nhanged.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The original question from Rajesh w=\r\nas a very good one, and a real one . I compliment him for asking it and hav=\r\ning the courage to ask it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lord Shiva in Guru Gita tells to De=\r\nvi Parvati --- &quot;There is no mukti without bukti&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any good sai=\r\nnt I have had a chance to read or listen or speak to,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; never says that=\r\n &quot;Do Sadhana with spiritual expectations only&quot; In general I mean any type o=\r\nf Sadhana, Japam, Homam, Karma Yoga, Seva, Charitable donation, bhajan,sats=\r\nang and many other types.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; They always try to increase further =\r\nthe Shraddaha of a sadhak in things that captivates a Sadhaka&#39;s mind due to=\r\n his or her state of sanskars.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; They always try to help the Sad=\r\nhak walk on the path that leads towards spirituality. They always wish well=\r\n for their disciples and have good amount of patience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many Sa=\r\ndgurus take care of their disciples for many life times, helping and guidin=\r\ng in each life time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; They always preach many things and show v=\r\nalue for different types of sadhanas depending on their state, time, and ty=\r\npe of disciple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For householders always there are challanges a=\r\nnd one should request God to look into it and give guidance and help, wheth=\r\ner it is food, house, marriage, car, or any material issue. There is nothin=\r\ng wrong in doing this, even if sadhana done for materialistic benefits.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Today even those who have renounced householder life have to pray=\r\n god to fulfill some of their material needs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We live in very =\r\ndifficult and challanging times and it appears it is going to become more c=\r\nhallenging.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some material gain can at times make a person bett=\r\ner or more balanced or be more prepared to do sadhana for spiritual benefit=\r\ns. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even during an eclipse many people do mantras etc to solve=\r\n problems or improve material conditions, there is nothing wrong about it. =\r\nI have read messages in the past on this group suggesting natives not to do=\r\n it or it is wrong. These type of messages are not correct, it only confuse=\r\ns people. Time during the eclipse is very good for getting results for any =\r\nsadhana done during that time. it is equally good for material or spiritual=\r\n type.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Everyone has right to have a opinion and share their vi=\r\news but one needs to also understand the influence aspect of those views.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Every Shotra or prayer or even Geeta or Ramayan, there are ride=\r\nrs at the end for results like becoming wealthy, overcoming challenges, ene=\r\nmies etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If it were inappropriate the Seers from the past would not =\r\nwrite it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Are they wrong in writing that?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; They write it=\r\n to motivate people to read them as one reads more times there is a possibi=\r\nlity that may lead to change in the person&#39;s attitude.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moving =\r\nto original set of questions,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Every one is born with accumulat=\r\ned sanskars out of which as a native interacts with the world some of these=\r\n accumulated or sanchit sanskars take the form of prarabdh sanskara, these =\r\ntype of sanskars give pleasure, pain and challanges to the native. Sanchit =\r\nSanskars are like seeds and Prarabdh sanskars are like a tree that bears fr=\r\nuit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; All human beings are also born with another quality and t=\r\nhat is known as will power. They say will power can change destiny ...\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one does sadhana like say Homaam or Japam. Many things happen=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at many levels, at times there is improvement in materialistic situa=\r\ntion, problems get solved or if the problems remain that state of sadhaka b=\r\necomes such that he or she pays less attention to the problem or attaches l=\r\ness importance to the problem. God or Guru or Shakti shows the sadhaka a pa=\r\nth to move forward. Sadhana does increase will power and makes one more tol=\r\nerant and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sadhana also help in eliminating the sanchit sanskars, in =\r\nfact one Saint use to say, do your sadhana and your sanchit sanskars will g=\r\net crushed such that they can never germinate or fruitify into prarabdh san=\r\nskars.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So yes doing sadhana can help one overcome many things =\r\nat different levels and help one move in the right direction. At times one =\r\nmoves faster or very slowly. The important thing is moving and if one falls=\r\n down, than one should immediately get up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are many ways=\r\n to improve and move faster towards spirtuality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vimalanda is not jus=\r\nt one saint, there are many who have reached similar or higher or lower rea=\r\nlizations adopting different methods and have written very good books too. =\r\nSprituality is much bigger, deeper and broader than what Vimalanada has des=\r\ncribed in his books.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I find it little cultish to just refer hi=\r\nm all the time in the group. Spirituaity is atleast not a narrow cult.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please note that I have nothing against Him, I respect him as I re=\r\nspect other saints from the bottom of my heart. I did spent money to get hi=\r\ns books and plan to read in near future.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I urge all the reader=\r\ns of this group to read more books from different sects, different saints a=\r\nnd try to get appropriate influence. Get broader and deeper views as that h=\r\nelps forming a good base for spirituality. Spirtuality is about tolerance a=\r\nnd remaining neutral in different situations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Nath Samprad=\r\naya, Shiviates from Kashmir, the lineage of Ramananda,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Datta Samprada=\r\nya, the sufis, even some christain saints (The book of Mirdad) and many mor=\r\ne sects some of the Lhamas of Buddhism had very deeper realizations and exp=\r\neriance. There are many sects in south india too, kerala, tamil nadu, andhr=\r\na pradhesh, maharastra,rajasthan, gujarat and other states, all of them had=\r\n great saints.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Generally these saints never bothered to write =\r\nor explain or were not able to explain. But some did write and a lot of goo=\r\nd work is out there to explore along with doing sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We li=\r\nve in times where there is very little guidance available on the path of sp=\r\nirituality. So in these times we have to make up with reading good books wr=\r\nitten by saints of yestaryers and surrender more to god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There=\r\n is scarcity of Sadgurus and good Sadhaks, we have many entry level and con=\r\nfused situation :-) ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you look at sikhism, the last sadg=\r\nuru dev from their sect made the book &quot;granth saheb&quot; as the guru instead of=\r\n making anyone else take his seat.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When Lahiri Mahashaya met a=\r\n famoius saint of kashi, he got lot of respect from him. Some of the famous=\r\n saint&#39;s disciple were upset,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at that the saint reminds them that to =\r\nreach his own spiritual state he took 400 or so years but Lahiri Mahashaya =\r\ndid it in one birth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; His name slips my tongue, he was big and very st=\r\nrong lived in water many hours at a time, his name starts with tri. They sa=\r\ny that one is not able to stare at the eyes of the statue of the saint at h=\r\nis samadhi mandir.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One must always try to broaden ones perspec=\r\ntive, all of us have a long long way to go, even if some may feel that oh I=\r\n only have some more things left so I may be done in some years, even that =\r\nis an interesting situation as there is always a chance of falling down.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even for Saint Bharathari one of the nav naths, he was so elevat=\r\ned but he also had some sanskars that forced him to take birth and enjoy fi=\r\nrst and than suffer due to pingala. He was already realized before his birt=\r\nh as the rajah.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I did not intend to offend anyone or thier vei=\r\nws, If I inadvertantly did it I appologize in advance, Narashima has writte=\r\nn very well many times and of late has written some good stuff.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mitesh \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Raju,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It seems honest outburst.

It sounds like- b=\r\necause &#39;Agni&#39; is very effective medium for praying, one is taking its advan=\r\ntage to get all the mundane benefits, release from various troubling issues=\r\n, fulfilling the worldly ambitions. It&#39;s like switching the source (Normal =\r\nprayers in temples, Japam etc...) for asking the same thing. It&#39;s like acti=\r\nng very smart with God. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha Insisted in his homam m=\r\nanual about the mental attitude.

I, you and others must cultivate=\r\n the idea of self surrender. Oh Mother! We are doing this homam and request=\r\n you to take us from darkness to Light, from lesser truth to higher truth, =\r\nfrom poison (desires) to Nectar (Devotion). Please make us so strong that w=\r\ne can accept, with mental equilibrium, whatever you decide for us. Eradicat=\r\ne our ego and make us tools in your hands. Make us sit on your lap by purif=\r\nying us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After some few years struggle, i have understood that one =\r\nmust not confuse Spiritual rituals with Material benefits.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n As Narayana said our money, fame etc...are the result of Rnas/Karmas. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We must pray during homam for the continuation of daily Homam=\r\n.
