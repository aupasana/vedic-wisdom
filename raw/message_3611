They will take\nonly the colour you dip them in, whatever it may be.\n\nIf you are in bad company, then you will talk and think like your\ncompanions.

He shows his affection to them in different ways. But his mind is\none and the\nsame.\n\n&quot;Bondage is of the mind, and freedom is also of the mind. A man is free if\nhe constantly thinks: &#39;I am a free soul. How can I he bound, whether I live\nin the world or in the forest? I am a child of God, the King of Kings.
