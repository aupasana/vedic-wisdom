I would really\n\tappreciate if you could kindly grant me your permission and blessings.\n\n2.\tYou mentioned that the Ganapati idol has to be placed on the East  \nside of the homam kundam. I also noticed the same in your video.\n\tMy homam kundam is slightly bigger at 15 inches square. Thus if I  \nplace the idol on the East side, I find it difficult to offer the  \nitems during the pooja.\n\tIs it aright to place the idol nearer, i.e. on the South-West or  \nNorth-West corner so that it is easily accessible?\n\n3.\tWhat is the significance of offering the doership of the homam to  \nLord Krishna at the end?\n\tThe homam was offered with the intention of spiritual cleansing and  \nupliftment. I am sure Lord Krishna does not require spiritual  \ncleansing and upliftment.\n\tSo what then is the significance of offering the doership to Lord  \nKrishna?\n\n4.\tMy knowledge of Sanskrit is very basic and thus my pronunciation  \nrequires my improvement. I am really worried that my pronunciation of  \nthe mantras may be wrong\n\tin many places. While I try my best to listen to your video and  \nlearn, I realise that this is a long process.\n\n\tI do realise  that you had provided a very short procedure requiring  \nvery little mantras. However I find that my knowledge  is somewhere in  \nbetween your 2 procedures.\n\t\n\tWould I be committing any grave mistakes and thus offending the  \ndeities and Agni?\n\t\n\n\nThank you.\n\n\nOm Shanti Shanti Shanti\n\nWarmest Regards,\nNarayanan\n\n\n\n"}}
