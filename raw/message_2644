Earlier, and to some extent =\r\neven now, these limitations  sucked me down...made me feel low...frozen in =\r\nthought...but i hope as i gain greater strength within i will learn how to =\r\novercome these feelings and become more free...of energies that pull me dow=\r\nn...\n\nat present chanting works for me better than meditation. i sometimes =\r\nget emotional during chanting and tears start flowing. there are many block=\r\ns that perhaps need to dissolve...\n\nthere is a certain relationship that ha=\r\ns started building with ganapati and with fire. i feel happy to light the l=\r\namp and take the fire from it to the homam...to light the agarbattis ...to =\r\nhear a certain roaring sound that develops if the fire is strong...to hear =\r\nthe fire crackle....and leap up...\n\na few times it has happened that the fi=\r\nre has gone out...but i try not to get disturbed because of this...and ligh=\r\nt it again.\n\ni also feel that each and every part of the coconut should bur=\r\nn completely...though i dont want to be obsessed by this...\n\nlittle by litt=\r\nle i feel i am beginning to see a little bit of lali mere lal ki...jit dekh=\r\nun tit laal...\n\nthank you!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Nara=\r\nsimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I&#39;m sharing this email =\r\nonly with you. In case you forward\n&gt; &gt; it to the group, please remove my pe=\r\nrsonal details.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am sending it to the group by removing your persona=\r\nl references, as several other people may be in the same situation sooner o=\r\nr later.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Points 1 and 2 could be either mea=\r\nningful or just simple coincidences. Points 3 and 4 are possible if there i=\r\ns some flow of vaayus in some nadis, to cleanse the nadis. These really sou=\r\nnd like premonitory signs before certain experiences.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, if one=\r\n read about certain visions or experiences in the past and has those desire=\r\ns/memories stored in conscious or sub-conscious mind, then also it is possi=\r\nble to experience similar things.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If they are hallucinations, they do=\r\n not help in your spiritual progress. If they are not hallucinations, they =\r\nshould slowly bring some internal transformation. If you see your pride and=\r\n sense of self-importance go down slowly, if you see your internal reaction=\r\ns to praises and criticism from people start to become more moderated and b=\r\nalanced, if you see your weaknesses such as lust, anger, jealosy etc becomi=\r\nng smaller etc, then you know that you are on the right track. That alone i=\r\ns the measure of progress.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Irresepctive of =\r\nwhether these are hallucinations or genuine experiences, the key thing is: =\r\ndo not get attracted and get stuck. Suppose one is driving on a road going =\r\nto the top of a mountain. Suppose the scenery at some spot is very beautifu=\r\nl. If one is mesmerized by the scenery and stops there, one will never get =\r\nto the top. However beautiful the scenery may be, it is just a distraction =\r\nfrom the final target. Observe the beautiful scenery that comes before your=\r\n eyes, but do not develop any attachment with it. It is particularly undesi=\r\nrable to develop an egoistic attachment, e.g. the sense that &quot;I experienced=\r\n this. I have achieved something. I am worthy.&quot; Just observe whatever is th=\r\nrown at you and continue the journey.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do not be attracted to an exper=\r\nience and do not view an experience as either desirable or undesirable. If =\r\nit comes, let it come. Still focus on the mantra.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; If we put a spark in wet grass, it will take a long time to catch fi=\r\nre. If we put a spark in dry grass, it will catch fire quickly. Similarly, =\r\nsome people will start to experience something quickly when they start a po=\r\nwerful purifying sadhana such as homam. Some people will take longer. Some =\r\npeople may not observe the scenery on the side of the road and keep just lo=\r\noking at the road and suddenly reach the top oneday. Some people may notice=\r\n all the scenery on the roadside, i.e. observe various experiences. Your pa=\r\nth and progress will be decided based on your karmas and vasanas, but it pa=\r\nys to know what the final target is and not be distracted by anything.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Your body is not the real you. Even the subtle body you may have visualiz=\r\ned is not the real you. Even the divine light you saw at heart is not the r=\r\neal you. None of what you saw is the real you. The real you is the all-enco=\r\nmpassing light apart from which nothing exists. When you are established in=\r\n the real Self, there is no concept of I, my body, my heart, he, she, you, =\r\nwe, this, that etc. Until that I is discovered, one keeps walking the path.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; But what you described sounds good and you seem to be making progres=\r\ns. Good.

I&#39;m having some very goo=\r\nd experiences after I&#39;ve started doing Ganapati homam. However, I&#39;m not sur=\r\ne if these are my hallucinations. I wanted to share the same with you and u=\r\nnderstand if there are any stages of experiences (I would think the final o=\r\nne would be seeing the almighty Ganapati deva). Please share your thoughts =\r\non the same.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I&#39;m sharing this email only with you. In case you forwar=\r\nd it to the group, please remove my personal details.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Following are m=\r\ny experiences:\n&gt; 1. I&#39;ve been receiving indications from the almighty Ganap=\r\nati deva from time to time on my day-to-day activities where some decisions=\r\n are involved and where I ask the lord to guide me.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. I&#39;ve literally=\r\n experienced the &quot;leela&quot; of deva - I&#39;ll narrate one instance (there are qui=\r\nte a number of them). I&#39;d to catch a luxury bus at 8:00 pm one day and all =\r\nbuses were running full till 9:30 pm (for two travel companies). I&#39;d an opt=\r\nion to go ahead and check for other travel companies but I felt as if the l=\r\nord instructed me to go to a certain place and try for one specific 8 pm bu=\r\ns which as per my knowledge was already full. I went there and they offered=\r\n me a seat near the driver and I was ok to sit there - but the driver asked=\r\n me to wait for 10 min as it was very hot inside (till the bus leaves). I w=\r\naited and went to grab a cup of tea. When I came back, I was told that the =\r\nseat near the driver is gone and now I&#39;m left with a spot near the bus door=\r\n. In this seat, I certainly cannot afford to take a nap. I told in my mind =\r\n- &quot;O Lord - I&#39;m so tired&quot;. Now typically, I&#39;d loose my temper and shout at =\r\nthat guy. However, I felt some energy which is\n&gt; &gt;  holding my temper. I fe=\r\nlt I would burst at the driver but my anger did not come out (even I was wo=\r\nndering why). In next 2 min, the same guy came back to me and told me that =\r\none of the seats have been cancelled by some other passenger who did not tu=\r\nrn up and asked me to move inside the bus. I was so thrilled and had no wor=\r\nds to thank the lord. I was able to have a very good nap - thanks to the &quot;l=\r\neela of the lord&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 3. While meditating after the homam, I&#39;ve started =\r\nexperiencing some sort of divine light. I was thinking this was my hallucin=\r\nation earlier. But I&#39;m unable to experience this without the homam. Earlier=\r\n I used to see a yellowish light (not the normal yellow that we generally s=\r\nee - but I know this is a divine one) which used to come and go - and give =\r\nme a feel that I&#39;m traversing thru a forest at a very high speed. I started=\r\n seeing some other colors as well. In addition to this, yesterday I saw a d=\r\nivine violet/purple color which was so pleasing - I can say I&#39;ve never expe=\r\nrienced like this before. The light started small and then it grew big. And=\r\n when all this went off and I opened my eyes, I saw that the external fire =\r\nwas also off. I do try sometimes to medidate without the homam, but I dont =\r\nget such experiences. Is there any way you would suggest?\n&gt;  \n&gt; 4. In one i=\r\nnstance during meditation, I saw my body which looked very differently. And=\r\n there was a divine yellow light within my body near my heart. Could this b=\r\ne the internal fire? \n&gt;  \n&gt; Frankly, I dont have words to describe all of t=\r\nhese. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Irrespective of whether this a hallucination or the journey to=\r\nwards God, I&#39;m so grateful to you for leading us towards this journey. May =\r\nthe Lord Ganapati shower his blessings on you.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Warm Regards\n&gt; &lt;delete=\r\nd&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
