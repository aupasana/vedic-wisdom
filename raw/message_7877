I did not know\n&gt; it has happened but my whole day was fille=\r\nd with deep bliss. I have lot of\n&gt; very difficult pain in my body yet I did=\r\n\n&gt; not feel it on that day.Yet the pain was there, it did not go away or\n&gt; =\r\ndiminsh but I did not feel it. There were other\n&gt; several problems yet I co=\r\nuld not feel any tension or stress. I spent my\n&gt; day in a normal way yet al=\r\nl the time I was in a bliss. Funny enough I kept\n&gt; thinking that it is a no=\r\nrmal everyday thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Light left me next morning.\n&gt;\n&gt; As it left onl=\r\ny then I realised that I was surrounded by it and\n&gt; yesterday&#39;s bliss was d=\r\nirectly due to it. I was back to my normal self pain\n&gt; and and stress and a=\r\nll that. If anybody has ever been in a large\n&gt; airconditioned building for =\r\nseveral hours and then come out on street\n&gt; with heat and dust, the immedia=\r\nte impact on body and mind might\n&gt; convay those feelings. If that Light had=\r\n remain permanantly I am sure I\n&gt; would be a Jeevanmukt by now.\n&gt;\n&gt; Several=\r\n year before it, I did prayers to Sri Ganeshji. Every wednesday I\n&gt; would c=\r\nook myself besan moduk and then offer\n&gt; them to SriSri Ganeshji hoping He w=\r\nould cure me of my physical pain\n&gt; .I did it nearly a year, then somehow st=\r\nopped it as I thought nothing was\n&gt; happening but kept doing Prayers\n&gt; Seve=\r\nral days later after I had my early morning prayers a similar sort\n&gt; energy=\r\n came  and surrounded me. It was more intense but lasted a very\n&gt; short per=\r\niod . I knew it was SriSri Ganeshji kripa.\n&gt;\n&gt; The thing about white sugar =\r\nis that when I made those besan Ladoo I used\n&gt; white sugar.  I use white su=\r\ngar all the time and make sweet dishes and then\n&gt; offer them to Divine Bein=\r\ngs.. Only recently I heard people saying that it\n&gt; has bone ash in it. Is i=\r\nt really true?? I mean is it really true? How much\n&gt; it would be in a one k=\r\nilo bag of cane or beetroot sugar. Is it true only\n&gt; for western countries =\r\nor India as well. In India in all the Temples sweet\n&gt; dishes are made and o=\r\nffered to Deities. Does it mean there is bone ash in\n&gt; it if white sugar is=\r\n used? Is there any way of removing it ?\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  **\n=\r\n&gt; **\n&gt; *From:* Rama V &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com\n&gt; *Sent:* Monday, 20 February 2012, 5:31\n&gt; *Subject:* [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Re: On Jeevanmukti (liberation while living)\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste - Well, I still =\r\ndon&#39;t get it.

One\n&gt; &gt; engages in them with no agendas, likes, dislikes, and attachments=\r\n. Thus,\n&gt; &gt; a jeevanmukta operates the previous identity till the momentum =\r\ncomes to\n&gt; &gt; a screeching halt and then the body, senses, sensory mind, bud=\r\ndhi etc\n&gt; &gt; are returned to the original sources from which they were borro=\r\nwed and\n&gt; &gt; made sentient. But a jeevanmukta is free and unbound even while=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; operating with an identity, for binding comes from the conditioning an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; not from identification or actions. When the identity dissolves, it i=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; not any better or any extra freedom.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Most likely, a jeevanmuk=\r\nta ceases to operate an identity after some\n&gt; &gt; time, that time depending o=\r\nn the strength of prior momentum! It can be\n&gt; &gt; days or months or years or =\r\ncenturies or millennia.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nature sets such powerful momentum in place=\r\n for some beings (e.g.\n&gt; &gt; saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may ope=\r\nrate an identity for a\n&gt; &gt; very long time after conditioning drops off comp=\r\nletely.

As a part o=\r\nf the momentum set in\n&gt; &gt; motion previously, one may even direct a part of =\r\none&#39;s ahamkara to\n&gt; &gt; identify with a newly created identity (e.g. a new in=\r\ncarnation).

I wasn&#39;t perhaps clear enough. Obviously,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; these are not easy ideas=\r\n to communicate in vaikhari (external\n&gt; &gt; &gt; communication). I pray to Mahar=\r\nshi Vasishtha to imbibe something more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than vaikhari in the following=\r\n words so that people can understand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; better (not you Manish, the goal=\r\n of answering your questions is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; obviously not to impart any knowledge=\r\n to YOU, but to perhaps benefit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some others who may be ready - now or=\r\n in future).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is not identificat=\r\nion. The problem is *conditioning*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (likes, dislikes, wants, agendas e=\r\ntc) that drives the identification\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and use of what one&#39;s ahamkara ide=\r\nntifies with. If ahamkara\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (identification) evaporates when chitta (co=\r\nnditioning) is cleaned up,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it is normal mukti. If ahamkara (identific=\r\nation) remains while chitta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (conditioning) is cleaned up, it is jeeva=\r\nnmukti. It is as simple as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If o=\r\nne engages in an action with zero conditioning, then there is no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; karm=\r\na and there are no rinas created. Actions (physical or mental) by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\nmselves do not bind one - it is the  *conditioned* actions that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bind =\r\none! It is the likes, dislikes, desires, agendas etc (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conditioni=\r\nng in chitta) behind an action that bind one!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; If somebody who is not YET a jeevanmukta (but close) identified with a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; body and engaged in an action that IS driven by some conditioning,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; however subtle or pure or dharmik that conditioning may be (!), then\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; that sets in motion the law of kaarmik action-reaction which will in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; due time give a particular reaction to what one identified with when\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; engaging in that action.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; By the time the reaction is experienced, =\r\nall the conditioning may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; overcome and one may become jeevanmukta. =\r\nYet, the momentum set in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; motion before one became jeevanmukta will co=\r\nntinue to affect the body,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; senses and sensory mind, i.e. whatever one=\r\n&#39;s ahamkara is identifying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with. But, because there is no conditionin=\r\ng and hence no agendas, no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; desires, no likes and dislikes, one neithe=\r\nr rejoices nor protests nor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tries to modify the happenings to what on=\r\ne is identifying with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sensing that there i=\r\ns a pain requires no conditioning. It is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; function of manas, i.e. =\r\nChandra. Observing that there is more pain in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the evening than mornin=\r\ng (or when swallowing) requires no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conditioning. It is the function o=\r\nf buddhi, i.e. Budha. But thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of praying to god to reduce pain r=\r\nequires conditioning in chitta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (absent in a jeevanmukta!).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thou=\r\ngh a jeevanmukta is identifying with a body, one does not view it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as =\r\nsomething his own and something that must be kept in a particular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sta=\r\nte. He identifies with it, but has no agendas for it. All that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comes =\r\nfrom conditioning in chitta, which is absent now!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The unconditioned i=\r\ndentifier (liberated I-ness) views what one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; identifies with as an *am=\r\nalgam* of portions borrowed from various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deities (pancha mahabhootas,=\r\n Moon, Mercury, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc) and hence as a manife=\r\nstation of Light itself. One does not view\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it from the prism of &quot;this=\r\n is me, I need to use it to pursue X or Y\n&gt; &gt; &gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;t=\r\nhis is me. I am made of portions borrowed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from various deities, i.e. =\r\nvarious manifestations of Light. I observe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their play, i.e. what they=\r\n do, and I have no agenda pursue using\n&gt; &gt; &gt; them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is the essen=\r\nce of Upanishads and Yoga Vaasishtham, as well as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mantra Pushpam that=\r\n we were discussing a while back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I repeat, identification is not the=\r\n problem. It is the conditioning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that drives how one uses what one id=\r\nentifies with, that is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; problem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n now feel like I have expressed myself better, though, given how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; subt=\r\nle and nuanced this knowledge is, some people may still get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; confused =\r\n(if so, please don&#39;t worry.

And, we say that he was a Jeevanmukta.=\r\n So how can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that happen, if according to that definition, the mind mu=\r\nst be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; identifying 24/7 with Atma to be qualified as a Jeevanmukta?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; The answer is straight forward. I await your reply.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kindest regar=\r\nds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Sunday, February 19, 2012, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt; pvr@\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;java=\r\nscript:parent.wgMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;pvr@&#39;)&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste, As=\r\n twitter is too restrictive a medium, I want to answer a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; question th=\r\nat came up in an exchange between my guru Manish and me on\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Twitter, =\r\nhere. Some portions of the Twitter exchange are quoted at\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the end, i=\r\nn chronological order, in case someone is interested in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; backgrou=\r\nnd. I will answer the following question posed by Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; based on my=\r\n understanding: &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to my mind is this: was\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Ramakrishna =\r\na Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he suffer with throat\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he was=\r\n not identifying with his actions? (according to your\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation=\r\n of Vasistha&#39;s definition??)&gt;&gt;&gt; * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82\n&gt;=\r\n =C3=82  =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 * Let me elaborate on my understanding of jee=\r\nvanmukti. Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; loosely (in my view) said in this exchange that rin=\r\nas are of body and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta continues to fulfil those rinas. Bu=\r\nt body is an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; insentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not o=\r\nf the body,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; but of the mind that identifies with it. It is the antah=\r\nkaranas of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta (memory/conditioning)=\r\n - that are\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the source of various rinas, particularly chitta. As min=\r\nd identifies\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with a body, it projects its rinas on the body and make=\r\ns the body\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with those\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; rinas/conditioning. If the conditioning in chitta is completely wiped\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; out and ahamkara merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; conditioning in chitta is completely wiped out and yet ahamkara\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; co=\r\nntinues to exist with no limiting notions (it is basically the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; condi=\r\ntioning in chitta that is limiting), then one becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta (l=\r\niberated while living). Unlike in the case of one who\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; leaves body an=\r\nd gets mukti, a jeevanmukta continues to have an I-ness\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (but which i=\r\ns not limited by any notions or conditioning). This\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; unconditioned I-=\r\nness does project into a body. But it does not say &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; am this body a=\r\nnd hence this body should be kept healthy or strong&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be =\r\nconditioning in chitta, which is wiped out now!). On\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand,=\r\n it does not either say &quot;this body should be ignored\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and destroyed&quot;.=\r\n Though conditioning is absent now, body keeps\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing and doin=\r\ng things based on the *momentum* set in motion\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; before one became jee=\r\nvanmukta and engaged in conditioned experiences\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and actions. This is=\r\n like a fan turning for a while after the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; electricity has been stopp=\r\ned. Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep working\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as they did before. If o=\r\nne has throat cancer, indriyas may sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (sensory/motor =\r\nmind) may process that input and register\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi may analyze v=\r\narious observations and draw various\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp =\r\nor try to swallow food, it hurts even\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so =\r\nherbal liquid, it feels better&quot; etc). A\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; normal person whose conditio=\r\nned mind (chitta) says &quot;I should overcome\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and not have this pain&quot; ma=\r\ny think of various things to do and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; struggle with them. But an uncon=\r\nditioned being has no such\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; considerations. Though one may feel and e=\r\nxpress the pain and other\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objective experiences, one reacts to it di=\r\nfferently. * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82\n&gt; * =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82  =C3=\r\n=82  =C3=82 * This is a key point: Manas and buddhi are good at making\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; objective observations and rational deductions, but, by themselves,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; they do not have ANY agenda. They neither like something nor dislike\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; something. THAT comes from the conditioning in chitta! The hallmark\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is absent! * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=\r\n=82 * =C3=82  =C3=82\n&gt; =C3=82  =C3=82 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a je=\r\nevanmukta is a moot question. A better\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; way to express your question =\r\nis: Can a jeevanmukta get throat cancer\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? How is it pos=\r\nsible if there are no karmas or rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; left? I have already answered =\r\nit. But, let me sum it up briefly\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body, various body parts, j=\r\nnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi of a jeevanmukta continue=\r\n to operate as before. One&#39;s I-ness\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is intact and does project itsel=\r\nf onto those. But neither I-ness nor\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; those things carry any rinas or=\r\n karmas. Chitta - the repository of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning and rinas - is clea=\r\nn. There are no limiting notions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas, manas & budd=\r\nhi keep experiencing and doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things (good or bad!) based on the pr=\r\nevious momentum set by the play\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas and karmas while some condit=\r\nioning was left in chitta. Body,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, indriyas of jna=\r\nna and karma and manas are all\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed from various deitie=\r\ns. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sentience into them by projecting aware=\r\nness into them. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is what drives how all th=\r\nese are viewed and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; used. Instead of looking at a sense organ as a po=\r\nrtion of Indra or\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views it as &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;,=\r\n due to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta. That is what creates karmas and rina=\r\ns. When\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that conditioning is *completely* overcome, ahamkara can sti=\r\nll\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; project awareness into those objects, but it sees them for what t=\r\nhey\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are. It does not have false and limiting notions like &quot;this thro=\r\nat is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel nice and not feel painful&quot;. * =C3=82  =C3=\r\n=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82\n&gt; =C3=82  =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 * Most people w=\r\nho may claim to be (or think they are) jeevanmuktas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are not really j=\r\neevanmuktas in today&#39;s world. If one wants to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; understand the state o=\r\nf jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham is the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; book. The entire discour=\r\nse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; detailed and elaborate de=\r\nfinition and characterization of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. There may be other b=\r\nooks that explain better how to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; various sadhanas to progress spir=\r\nitually and get closer to being\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; liberated oneday. But, when it comes=\r\n elaborating what liberation\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; while living actually is, there is none=\r\n better than Yoga Vaasishtham.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one can say that this is m=\r\nerely an intellectual exercise\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are concerned. It perh=\r\naps is, as none of may ever\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; become a jeevanmukta.. One word of cauti=\r\non: I write with a very\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; confident tone when I have strong conviction=\r\n in what I write. That is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; how I am. But I can definitely be wrong. S=\r\no please feel free to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ignore me! :-) Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow nigh=\r\nt) to all!

Nothing really, fulfilling all rnas, wait=\r\n for\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rnas to be over. Narasimha: If a &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in &quot;fulfil=\r\nling\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all rnas&quot;, will he b bound again? If no, y r they called rnas? =\r\nIf\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; yes, y call him mukta? Manish: No, rnas will work out themselves,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; slowly or fast as may be the case. The rnas are of the body he or s=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occupies. He is mukta because he experiences, actually sees the r=\r\nnas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to be the body&#39;s only. Rnas apply to the body, not to you. You a=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that &quot;speck of effulgent light&quot;, call it what you want, Atma, etc=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent light was never bound. So=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; who exactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it have rnas? If these &quot;r=\r\nnas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of body&quot; r somehow not fulfilled after one bcomes jeevanmukta, w=\r\nhat\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; happens to one? :-) Manish: You are right. The mind thought, tha=\r\nt, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; was the body, instead of this light. That is the original prob=\r\nlem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Which every being is born with. Rnas arise from this identifica=\r\ntion\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; which creates karma. U r not that, so u r not bound, when the m=\r\nind\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; realises this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is also not quite true, since u r =\r\nthat\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginning Narasimha: Then, r the rnas of the &quot;bod=\r\ny&quot; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; u said r of the mind? When a mind identifies with light & bcom=\r\nes\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mukta, does it hv rnas left? Manish: Ok, karmas projected into mi=\r\nnd,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are acted on and may be experienced by body. So, why is a jeevan=\r\nmukta\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; subject to this? because, that person although aware of the li=\r\nght at\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all times, and of the causal n subtle bodies, has not yet dir=\r\nected d\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mind to identify as that light at all times, key word being =\r\n&quot;all&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; This gives karmas time to work. Next stage is 24/7 id with li=\r\nght\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: As per my understanding, the person u r defining is n=\r\not a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. He may b an elevated being, but not mukta (liberat=\r\ned)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; yet. Manish: I derive that definition of this &quot;state&quot; from someb=\r\nody,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; no problem in disagreement. 24/7 identification with light, mos=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; likely body should not exist, no? Narasimha: Id with light forever=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with body dropping off is just mukti, not jivanmukti! Jivanmukti is=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; where body stays. Is body really different from light? In fact, is\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; there anything other than light? Jivanmukti is seeing the play of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; objects but seeing all as light. Mukti & rna are contradictory\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nconcepts & cant coexist. U rnt &quot;free&quot; till u pay back what u owe. And\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; that means u dont owe anybody anything once u r truly free. Words\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nlike free, liberated & jivanmukta r often misused. Manish: Will\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; expl=\r\nain a bit in detail sometime. Narasimha: OK. :-) But, as far as\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;exp=\r\nlaining&quot; is concerned, Vasishtha explained as clearly &\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; elaborately =\r\nas any human being can ever hope 2. Manish: The question\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to my mind =\r\nis this: was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; suffer wit=\r\nh throat cancer if he was not identifying with his actions?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (accordi=\r\nng to your interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Vas=\r\nishtha didnt give a single definition. His entire\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; discourse 2 Rama i=\r\ns a definition of jeevanmukta! Will answer ur RK qn\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &lt;http://docs.yah=\r\noo.com/info/terms/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n|| Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!

One&#39;s experiences and actions are due to=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; the momentum set in motion by previously present conditioning. On=\r\ne &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; engages in them with no agendas, likes, dislikes, and attachmen=\r\nts. Thus, &lt;br&gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta operates the previous identity till the mo=\r\nmentum comes to &lt;br&gt;&gt; a screeching halt and then the body, senses, senso=\r\nry mind, buddhi etc &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; are returned to the original sources from whi=\r\nch they were borrowed and &lt;br&gt;&gt; made sentient. But a jeevanmukta is free=\r\n and unbound even while &lt;br&gt;&gt; operating with an identity, for binding co=\r\nmes from the conditioning and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;\n not from identification or actions=\r\n. When the identity dissolves, it is &lt;br&gt;&gt; not any better or any extra f=\r\nreedom.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Most likely, a jeevanmukta ceases to operate an id=\r\nentity after some &lt;br&gt;&gt; time, that time depending on the strength of pri=\r\nor momentum! It can be &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; days or months or years or centuries or mi=\r\nllennia.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Nature sets such powerful momentum in place for s=\r\nome beings (e.g. &lt;br&gt;&gt; saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may oper=\r\nate an identity for a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; very long time after conditioning drops off=\r\n completely. It may even be &lt;br&gt;&gt; for the entire duration of Creation. A=\r\ns a part of the momentum set in &lt;br&gt;&gt; motion previously, one may even di=\r\nrect a part of one&#39;s ahamkara to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; identify with a newly create=\r\nd identity (e.g. a new incarnation).

I pray to Ma=\r\nharshi Vasishtha to imbibe something more &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; than vaikhari in th=\r\ne following words so that people can understand &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; better (not y=\r\nou Manish, the goal of answering your questions is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; obviously=\r\n not to impart any knowledge to YOU, but to perhaps benefit &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; s=\r\nome others who may be ready - now or in future).&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt; *=A0 =A0 =A0=\r\n =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The problem is not identification. The=\r\n problem is *conditioning* &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (likes, dislikes, wants, agendas e=\r\ntc) that drives the identification &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; and use of what one&#39;s =\r\nahamkara identifies with. If ahamkara &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (identification) evapo=\r\nrates when chitta (conditioning) is cleaned up, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; it is normal =\r\nmukti. If ahamkara (identification) remains while chitta &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (con=\r\nditioning) is cleaned up, it is jeevanmukti. It is as simple as &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; that.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If =\r\none engages in an action with zero conditioning, then there is no &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; karma and there are no rinas created. Actions (physical or mental) by =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; themselves do not bind one - it is the=A0 *conditioned* actio=\r\nns that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; bind one! It is the likes, dislikes, desires, agenda=\r\ns etc\n (i.e. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; conditioning in chitta) behind an action that bi=\r\nnd one!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If so=\r\nmebody who is not YET a jeevanmukta (but close) identified with a &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; body and engaged in an action that IS driven by some conditioning, &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; however subtle or pure or dharmik that conditioning may be (!),=\r\n then &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; that sets in motion the law of kaarmik action-reaction =\r\nwhich will in &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; due time give a particular reaction to what one=\r\n identified with when &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; engaging in that action.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nBy the time the reaction is experienced, all the conditioning may be &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; overcome and one may become jeevanmukta. Yet, the momentum set in &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; motion before one became jeevanmukta will continue to affect t=\r\nhe body, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; senses and sensory mind, i.e. whatever one&#39;s ah=\r\namkara is identifying &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; with. But, because\n there is no conditi=\r\noning and hence no agendas, no &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; desires, no likes and dislikes=\r\n, one neither rejoices nor protests nor &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; tries to modify the h=\r\nappenings to what one is identifying with.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sensing that there is a pain requires no co=\r\nnditioning.

Observ=\r\ning that there is more pain in &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; the evening than morning (or w=\r\nhen swallowing) requires no &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; conditioning. It is the function=\r\n of buddhi, i.e. Budha. But thinking &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of praying to god to red=\r\nuce pain requires conditioning in chitta &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (absent in a jeevanm=\r\nukta!).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Though a jeevanmukta is identifying with a body, one d=\r\noes not view it &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; as something his own and something that must=\r\n be kept in a particular &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; state. He identifies with it, but ha=\r\ns no agendas for it. All\n that &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; comes from conditioning in chi=\r\ntta, which is absent now!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The unconditioned identifier (libera=\r\nted I-ness) views what one &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; identifies with as an *amalgam* of=\r\n portions borrowed from various &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; deities (pancha mahabhootas,=\r\n Moon, Mercury, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Time &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; etc) and hence as =\r\na manifestation of Light itself. One does not view &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; it from th=\r\ne prism of &quot;this is me, I need to use it to pursue X or Y &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;this is me. I am made of portions bo=\r\nrrowed &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; from various deities, i.e. various manifestations of L=\r\night. I observe &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; their play, i.e. what they do, and I have no =\r\nagenda pursue using &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; them.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; This is the ess=\r\nence of Upanishads and Yoga Vaasishtham, as well as &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Mantra Pu=\r\nshpam that we were discussing a while back.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I repeat, identifi=\r\ncation is not the problem. It is the\n conditioning &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; that drive=\r\ns how one uses what one identifies with, that is the &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; problem.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I now feel l=\r\nike I have expressed myself better, though, given how &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; subtle=\r\n and nuanced this knowledge is, some people may still get &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; con=\r\nfused (if so, please don&#39;t worry. Not a big deal. Just keep doing &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; sadhana, for that&#39;s the most important thing!).

So how can &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that happen, i=\r\nf according to that definition, the mind must be &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; identifying =\r\n24/7 with Atma to be qualified as a Jeevanmukta?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The answer is=\r\n straight forward. I await your reply.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Kindest regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; On Sunday, February 19, 2012, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt; pvr@ &lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;javascript:parent.wgMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;pvr@&#39;)&gt; &gt;=\r\n wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste, As twitter is too restrictive a medium, I=\r\n want to\n answer a &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; question that came up in an exchange b=\r\netween my guru Manish and me on &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Twitter, here. Some porti=\r\nons of the Twitter exchange are quoted at &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the end, in chr=\r\nonological order, in case someone is interested in the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; b=\r\nackground. I will answer the following question posed by Manish &lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; based on my understanding: &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to my mind is th=\r\nis: was &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he suff=\r\ner with throat &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he was not identifying with his=\r\n actions? (according to your &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation of Vasistha&#=\r\n39;s definition??)&gt;&gt;&gt; * =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82 * =C3=\r\n=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82 &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 * Let me elaborate on my u=\r\nnderstanding of jeevanmukti. Manish &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; loosely (in my view)=\r\n said in this exchange that rinas are of body and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a\n jeev=\r\nanmukta continues to fulfil those rinas. But body is an &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; i=\r\nnsentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not of the body, &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; but of the mind that identifies with it. It is the antahkaranas of=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta (memory/conditionin=\r\ng) - that are &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the source of various rinas, particularly c=\r\nhitta. As mind identifies &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with a body, it projects its ri=\r\nnas on the body and makes the body &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;experience&quot=\r\n; and &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with those &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rin=\r\nas/conditioning. If the conditioning in chitta is completely wiped &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; out and ahamkara merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is completely wiped out and yet aha=\r\nmkara &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; continues to exist with no limiting notions (it is =\r\nbasically the &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta that is limiting), t=\r\nhen one\n becomes &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta (liberated while living). Un=\r\nlike in the case of one who &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; leaves body and gets mukti, a=\r\n jeevanmukta continues to have an I-ness &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (but which is no=\r\nt limited by any notions or conditioning). This &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; uncondit=\r\nioned I-ness does project into a body. But it does not say &quot;I &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; am this body and hence this body should be kept healthy or strong=\r\n&quot; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be conditioning in chitta, which is wi=\r\nped out now!). On &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand, it does not either say=\r\n &quot;this body should be ignored &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and destroyed&quot;. T=\r\nhough conditioning is absent now, body keeps &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing=\r\n and doing things based on the *momentum* set in motion &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nbefore one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned experiences &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; and actions. This is like a fan turning for a while after the &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n electricity has been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indriyas =\r\nkeep working &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as they did before. If one has throat cancer=\r\n, indriyas may sense &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may=\r\n process that input and register &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi may analyz=\r\ne various observations and draw various &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conclusions (e.g.=\r\n &quot;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurts even &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nmore&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels better&quot=\r\n; etc). A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; normal person whose conditioned mind (chitta) =\r\nsays &quot;I should overcome &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and not have this pain&quot;=\r\n may think of various things to do and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; struggle with them=\r\n. But an unconditioned being has no such &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; considerations.=\r\n Though one may feel and express the pain and other &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; objec=\r\ntive experiences, one reacts to it differently. * =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=\r\n=82=A0 =C3=82 * =C3=82 &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82 * This=\r\n is a key point: Manas and buddhi are good at making &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; obje=\r\nctive observations and rational deductions, but, by themselves, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; they do not have ANY agenda. They neither like something nor dislike=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; something. THAT comes from the conditioning in chitta! =\r\nThe hallmark &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is absent! * =\r\n=C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82 * =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=\r\n * &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot questi=\r\non. A better &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; way to express your question is: Can a jeev=\r\nanmukta get throat cancer &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? How is it possib=\r\nle if there are no karmas or rinas &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; left? I have already a=\r\nnswered it. But, let me sum it up briefly &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body, v=\r\narious body parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; b=\r\nuddhi of a jeevanmukta\n continue to operate as before. One&#39;s I-ness &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is intact and does project itself onto those. But neither I-=\r\nness nor &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; those things carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta -=\r\n the repository of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning and rinas - is clean. Th=\r\nere are no limiting notions. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas, ma=\r\nnas &amp; buddhi keep experiencing and doing &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; things (good=\r\n or bad!) based on the previous momentum set by the play &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n of rnas and karmas while some conditioning was left in chitta. Body, &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma and manas are =\r\nall &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (I-n=\r\ness) infuses &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sentience into them by projecting awareness=\r\n into them. The &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is what drives how=\r\n all these are viewed and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; used. Instead of looking at a s=\r\nense organ as a portion of\n Indra or &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views it =\r\nas &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, due to &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; condition=\r\ning in chitta. That is what creates karmas and rinas. When &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; that conditioning is *completely* overcome, ahamkara can still &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; project awareness into those objects, but it sees them for what th=\r\ney &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are. It does not have false and limiting notions like =\r\n&quot;this throat is &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel nice and not feel=\r\n painful&quot;. * =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82 * =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=\r\n=A0 =C3=82 &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 * Most people who may claim to be (or =\r\nthink they are) jeevanmuktas &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are not really jeevanmuktas =\r\nin today&#39;s world. If one wants to &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; understand the stat=\r\ne of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham is the best &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; book. The=\r\n entire discourse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama is a &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n detailed and elaborate definition and\n characterization of a &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; jeevanmukta. There may be other books that explain better how to do &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; various sadhanas to progress spiritually and get closer to =\r\nbeing &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; liberated oneday. But, when it comes elaborating wh=\r\nat liberation &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; while living actually is, there is none be=\r\ntter than Yoga Vaasishtham. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one can say that t=\r\nhis is merely an intellectual exercise &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are=\r\n concerned. It perhaps is, as none of may ever &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; become a =\r\njeevanmukta.. One word of caution: I write with a very &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; co=\r\nnfident tone when I have strong conviction in what I write. That is &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; how I am. But I can definitely be wrong. So please feel free to =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ignore me! :-) Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!=\r\n Best &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; regards, Narasimha &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n -------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------- =C3=82 Free &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings, &quot;Do It &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpa=\r\nna: =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82 &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=\r\n=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.=\r\norg/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &lt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.=\r\norg/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 Films that make a=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; difference: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://saraswatif=\r\nilms.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &lt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http:/=\r\n/SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=A0 =C3=82 &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &lt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D&quot;_b=\r\nlank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 Jyotis=\r\nh writings: &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyot=\r\nishWritings&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWriting=\r\ns&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyoti=\r\nshWritings&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings=\r\n&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &lt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jy=\r\notishWritings&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWriti=\r\nngs&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyo=\r\ntishWritings&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritin=\r\ngs&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0=\r\n =C3=82 &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 =C3=82=A0 Twitter ID: @homam1=\r\n08 &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n----- Twitter &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; exchange on jeevanmukta between Manish (twi=\r\ntter handle @mmpandit) and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha (twitter handle @hom=\r\nam108): Manish: So, what is a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta doing here? No=\r\nthing really,\n fulfilling all rnas, wait for &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rnas to be o=\r\nver. Narasimha: If a &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in &quot;fulfilling &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; all rnas&quot;, will he b bound again? If no, y r they called=\r\n rnas? If &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yes, y call him mukta? Manish: No, rnas will w=\r\nork out themselves, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; slowly or fast as may be the case. Th=\r\ne rnas are of the body he or she &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; occupies. He is mukta be=\r\ncause he experiences, actually sees the rnas &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to be the b=\r\nody&#39;s only. Rnas apply to the body, not to you. You are &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; that &quot;speck of effulgent light&quot;, call it what you want, Atma, =\r\netc. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent light was n=\r\never bound. So, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; who exactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did=\r\n &amp; does he/it have rnas? If these &quot;rnas &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of body&=\r\nquot; r somehow not fulfilled after one bcomes jeevanmukta, what &lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; happens to one? :-) Manish: You are right. The mind\n thought, that,=\r\n it &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; was the body, instead of this light. That is the orig=\r\ninal problem. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Which every being is born with. Rnas arise =\r\nfrom this identification &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; which creates karma. U r not tha=\r\nt, so u r not bound, when the mind &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; realises this. Became=\r\n &quot;Mukta&quot; is also not quite true, since u r that &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginning Narasimha: Then, r the rnas of the &quot=\r\n;body&quot; as &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; u said r of the mind? When a mind identifi=\r\nes with light &amp; bcomes &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mukta, does it hv rnas left? =\r\nManish: Ok, karmas projected into mind, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; are acted on and =\r\nmay be experienced by body. So, why is a jeevanmukta &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; subj=\r\nect to this? because, that person although aware of the light at &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; all times, and of the causal n subtle bodies, has not yet directed=\r\n d &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; mind to identify as that light at all times, key word =\r\nbeing\n &quot;all&quot;. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; This gives karmas time to work. N=\r\next stage is 24/7 id with light &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: As per my unde=\r\nrstanding, the person u r defining is not a &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. =\r\nHe may b an elevated being, but not mukta (liberated) &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ye=\r\nt. Manish: I derive that definition of this &quot;state&quot; from somebody=\r\n, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; no problem in disagreement. 24/7 identification with li=\r\nght, most &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; likely body should not exist, no? Narasimha: Id=\r\n with light forever &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with body dropping off is just mukti=\r\n, not jivanmukti! Jivanmukti is &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; where body stays. Is body=\r\n really different from light? In fact, is &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; there anything =\r\nother than light? Jivanmukti is seeing the play of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; objec=\r\nts but seeing all as light. Mukti &amp; rna are contradictory &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; concepts &amp; cant coexist. U rnt &quot;free&quot; till u pay back wh=\r\nat u owe. And &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n that means u dont owe anybody anything onc=\r\ne u r truly free. Words &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; like free, liberated &amp; jivanm=\r\nukta r often misused. Manish: Will &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; explain a bit in detai=\r\nl sometime. Narasimha: OK. :-) But, as far as &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;expl=\r\naining&quot; is concerned, Vasishtha explained as clearly &amp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; elaborately as any human being can ever hope 2. Manish: The question=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to my mind is this: was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so=\r\n, Why did he &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; suffer with throat cancer if he was not ide=\r\nntifying with his actions? &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (according to your interpretat=\r\nion of Vasistha&#39;s definition??) &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Vasishtha =\r\ndidnt give a single definition. His entire &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; discourse 2 R=\r\nama is a definition of jeevanmukta!
