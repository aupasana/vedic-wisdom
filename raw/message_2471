I had a few queries . Request you=\r\n to kindly answer them for me.\n\n1) During some homams performed at my home,=\r\n I have seen the Vadhyar (priest) ask my mother to light the homam fire dur=\r\ning the agni invocation. I am a Palaghat Iyer and on other ocassions when w=\r\ne had a namboothiri perform the homam he would light the homam fire himself=\r\n. \nMy question is whether I can ask my wife to start the homam fire or do i=\r\nt myself ?\n\n2) during the anganyasa and karanysa specifically the glaam bee=\r\njam , gleem shaktih , glaum kilakam mantraas/mudras , I used to touch the h=\r\neart , then right and left breasts respectively whereas in the video you ha=\r\nve shown it to be heart , navel and below respctively. Is the  beejam , sha=\r\nkthih and kilakam mudras /mantrams differnet for each diety ? \n\n3) There ar=\r\ne 4 more avhana mudras for  suprIto bhava,suprasanno bhava, varado bhava, s=\r\narvAbhIshTaprado bhava. The manual does not talks about these mudras. Kindl=\r\ny let me know if these are imporatnt and how to show these mudras.\n\nThanks =\r\nand regards,\nGirish Sundaram\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasim=\r\nha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) Our current goal is t=\r\no create a group of people who do a homam everyday \n&gt; and short procedure i=\r\ns conducive to it. Doing a one-off homam that takes 3-4 \n&gt; hours is far les=\r\ns useful than doing a 30 min homam everyday. It is like \n&gt; fasting everyday=\r\n and eating a 30-course meal once every few months vs eating \n&gt; dal and ric=\r\ne everyday.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, your request is good and I will try to create a l=\r\nong procedure \n&gt; manual atleast for Mahaganapathi homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) I have al=\r\nl of them in mind. Purusha sookta homam is the simplest homam \n&gt; and very u=\r\nseful for spiritual progress. I do have that in mind. Sudarsana \n&gt; homam ca=\r\nn also be done on a regular basis quickly. But navagraha homam is \n&gt; more t=\r\nime-consuming. I will eventually put all of them up.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; N=\r\narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituali=\r\nty: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3)=\r\n: http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://ww=\r\nw.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------ \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;gisundar&quot; &lt;gisund=\r\nar@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, September 01,=\r\n 2009 6:10 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Query related to Maha Ganapathi Hom=\r\nam\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaskaram PVR Narasimha Raoji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am a big fan of the =\r\nMaha Ganapathi Homam and I have seen it being \n&gt; &gt; performed at our home as=\r\n a kid many times. I always wanted to perform this \n&gt; &gt; homam on my own and=\r\n after seeing your video and the Laghu padhati document \n&gt; &gt; I am sure I ca=\r\nn do it myself. I have couple of requests from my side:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) Is it po=\r\nssible to create a document for the full fledged Ganapathi \n&gt; &gt; homam ? Thi=\r\ns will be immensely helpful for people who have the time and \n&gt; &gt; intrest t=\r\no perform such a homam.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) There are some other important homams pa=\r\nrticularly the following in \n&gt; &gt; which I am deeply intrested :\n&gt; &gt; a) Sudar=\r\nshana Homam\n&gt; &gt; b) Navagraha Homam\n&gt; &gt; c) Purusha Suktha Homam\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I wo=\r\nuld request you to kindly create documents similar to the Maha \n&gt; &gt; Ganapat=\r\nhi Homam PDF so that the larger population is benefited.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Swami Shar=\r\nanam.\n&gt; &gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Girish Sundaram\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
