I already know all this that y=\r\nou say - I am simply trying to draw you into explaining the logical quandar=\r\ny that is in there, but you are avoiding it (possibly because of my poor pr=\r\nesentation). Let me try once more to communicate more effectively, this tim=\r\ne I&#39;ll start from the basics as I understand them (please feel free to nega=\r\nte/correct them).\n\nTo me, as I have understood whatever texts I have read, =\r\nthat the ONLY source of consciousness, is Brahman. This has exactly 3 attri=\r\nbutes - it is pure truth (i.e. it is unconditional), it is pure awareness a=\r\nnd it is pure bliss. There is absolutely nothing else. There is no sense of=\r\n time, no sense of space, no sense of any boundary of any kind (spatial, te=\r\nmporal etc). Because boundaries would mean duality (at the very least). Con=\r\nsequently, there is no thought either - because thought has objects, and ob=\r\njects are objects because they are a boundary between something that is the=\r\n object and something that is not the object.\n\nSo how do boundaries (e.g. t=\r\nhought) come about in the first place? See, Western thinking believes (and =\r\nwe unknowingly mix concepts) in matter and consciousness, where matter is a=\r\nll that can be sensed (by the 5 senses), and consciousness is all that cant=\r\n (by the 5 senses). Vedic thinking goes deeper, and effectively divides con=\r\nsciousness into proto-matter (non-(5)-sensory matter - everything from the =\r\ngunas upto the mahabhutas) and pure/essential consciousness (brahman). \n\nSo=\r\n, if you want to use Western thinking, you can say - my sense of I and all =\r\nmy thoughts are in my consciousness. And you can get away with this stateme=\r\nnt, no one in the Western style of thinking will ever contradict you. But i=\r\nf you are to think the Vedic way, you cant say my sense of I and my thought=\r\ns are in Brahman. Due to the above definition of Brahman, every single thou=\r\nght or every single boundary you perceive or identify, has to have a corres=\r\nponding unique signature in proto-matter. Do you see where I&#39;m going with t=\r\nhis? There is no thought or feeling or identity or uniqueness that&#39;s &quot;just =\r\nin the mind&quot;. Every single one must have a signature i.e be a particular &quot;c=\r\nonfiguration&quot; of proto-matter. Consequently, at the immediate moment before=\r\n you enter NVKS, when you say &quot;I&quot; went into NVKS, the statement is a contra=\r\ndiction in itself. Because that &quot;I thinking of entering NVKS&quot; is nothing bu=\r\nt a configuration of proto-matter - it is simply a particular state of the =\r\nsookshma sarira. When NVKS is achieved, all you can say is - &quot;I&quot; disappeare=\r\nd - you cant say &quot;I got a feeling of enlightenment&quot;. You will now say - tha=\r\nt is exactly what I am saying with salt water doll analogy. But I say to th=\r\nat - then how can you say &quot;I&quot; reappeared. If pure consciousness is just as =\r\nI said above, when the &quot;I&quot; disappears, the entire sookshma sarira - essenti=\r\nally nothing but a configuration of proto-matter disappears. Who can bring =\r\nthat back? Pure consciousness has no memory, no motive, no increase, no dec=\r\nrease, no identity, nothing - it is INVARIANT. Then, if that configuration =\r\nof proto-matter (sookshma sarira) is to reappear (even if in a changed form=\r\n &quot;I got enlightened&quot;), it means there must be a memory of it somewhere, whi=\r\nch acted as the agent for &quot;reincarnating&quot; it. The only logical place for th=\r\nat memory (according to the argument presented above) is proto-matter itsel=\r\nf. So unless there is some kind of new construct that I dont know about, it=\r\n isnt possible for that very sookshma sarira to reappear. Consequently, if =\r\nthe physical body were to remain, it must mean a brand new sookshma sarira =\r\ngot instantly attached to it. \n\nSo I hope you get the point I&#39;m trying to m=\r\nake - it is easy to sweep things under the rug by doing a &quot;deux ex machina&quot;=\r\n (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deux_ex_machina), but this going in and out =\r\nof NVKS isnt logically consistent with what NVKS is portrayed to be.\n\nPleas=\r\ne tell me how I am wrong\n\n\nRegards\n\nSundeep\n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Removal of that ignorance and =\r\nrealization of true nature does not necessarily mean a destruction of body,=\r\n senses etc. They may continue to exist and intelligence may continue to op=\r\nerate through them. But the I-ness of the intelligence operating through th=\r\nem expands from the limited nature of before.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Only a deity or a =\r\nrishi or a yogi who can read one&#39;s mind can capture the state before and af=\r\nter and see what changed. The change is not necessarily observable by other=\r\n people using their sensory observation.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; However, one who is no =\r\nlonger deluded by the limited I-ness (&quot;this body, name and entity is I&quot;) ma=\r\ny behave differently compared to before.
