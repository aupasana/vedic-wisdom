But still, today being a worki=\r\nng day, I put some time limit and was not too convinced with the way the ho=\r\nmam went today. The dry coconuts were not catching fire (unlike the twigs I=\r\n used the last 2 days) and the fire went off twice before I put camphor to =\r\nreignite. \n&gt; Anyways, I am planning to do the homam in the weekends only un=\r\nless I get to know how I can manage sandhyavandanam along with homam ! \n&gt; P=\r\nreviously I was able to do Gayatri mantra and HareKrsna mahamantra in 90 mi=\r\nns or 100 mins and that was all completely mantras.\n&gt; Then, I started sandh=\r\nya vandanam along with Harekrsna mahamantra and my mahamantra numbers came =\r\ndown to accommodate the rituals of sandhya vandanam.\n&gt; Today (unliked the w=\r\neekend where I took more than 2 hours), I realized neither I have done sand=\r\nhya vandanam properly nor the homam properly to accommodate both of them. N=\r\not sure if I should do daily homam if the main part of the prayers go in wo=\r\nrrying about the agni in the kundam !\n&gt; \n&gt; My ranting aside, do we need to =\r\nfurther dry the dry coconuts; not sure why the small 1x1 pieces did not bur=\r\nn well. The final poornahuti has burnt well with half dry coconut. I use go=\r\nod amount of ghee and I am not sure if that much is needed as most of it si=\r\nmply flows down.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lastly, I tried in some shops yes&#39;day and everyone is=\r\n selling iron homa kundam only and they reply back that copper is not used =\r\n!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks Ajit for your responses again.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks VPathak.\n&gt; \n&gt; reg=\r\nards\n&gt; rAma\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic=\r\n_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Nagraj ji and other friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [&gt; =\r\n=C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. cleaning up the previous homam residues, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. putting=\r\n new aluminium foil in the homa kunda and below the homakunda, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. pu=\r\ntting aluminium foils before the homa kunda where I keep the ghee so that a=\r\nny spills would happen on the foil, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4.cleaning the Kalasa, putting c=\r\nhandan and kumkum for kalas, putting askshatas pouring water, putting a flo=\r\nwer in the kalasa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. preparing an oil lamp\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. putting darbhas =\r\naround the homa kunda\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 7. putting starter wood block in the homa kunda=\r\n along with camphor and darbhas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 8. melting the gree \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; ]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The issue of &quot;Arrangement&quot; for a Homa is almost for everybody =\r\nand i have also gone trough it for quite sometime. I would like to suggest =\r\nfrom my own method which may help you bring down 20 minutes to 10Min.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; 1) First of all, It is advisable to avoid Aluminum Foil. Aluminum foil =\r\ncutting for correct size and then adjusting on Homa kundam takes a good amo=\r\nunt of time. I did it for some 6 months initially and then there was a Mess=\r\nage from Narasimha that it is better to avoid Aluminum foil because Aluminu=\r\nm being a relatively modern metal and may carry Rahu&#39;s predominance. I stop=\r\nped foil since then...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) No need to wash Homa Kundam every day. I=\r\n do it once in a month or so. Let it be black and dark.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If the abo=\r\nve 2 points are observed, it can save some 5 to 7 minutes easily.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nNow, one can do following arrangements previous nights (the people who do H=\r\noma in the morning)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Empty the Homa Kundam and keep it clean (Tiss=\r\nue papers are very handy for this) and ready for next morning\n&gt; &gt; - Keep th=\r\ne Dry Coconut pieces or Wood ready.\n&gt; &gt; - Keep the Lamp ready with Wick\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n - Keep Camphor, Rice mixed with ghee and turmeric, Flowers, etc... ready. =\r\n(I do not use flowers any more. Use Akshatas mixed with Turmeric as flowers=\r\n..Bhagwan ko bolta hun BhavnaO ko Samjho! Phul ki jagape Chawal se kaam cha=\r\nlalo:-)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So when I get ready for Homam, I just have to fill up the =\r\ncopper tumbler with water and heat up the ghee and few other such activitie=\r\ns which takes around 5to7 Minutes in total.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Before i forget i must=\r\n remind that there is no need to keep the Darbha in 4 directions every time=\r\n. One can keep those Darbhas at the same place as many days as possible.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please ignore this Fool if the post did not make much sense.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; HavanOtpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; That was=C3=82=C2=A0a nice=\r\n post Ajit. I am also one of those people who, because of guilt factor of s=\r\nkipping sandhyavandana, unable to do the homa daily. I do it every week. Bu=\r\nt there is a little other logistics issue for me. I live in the US and I do=\r\n my homa in my living room where the Wood burning Fireplace (east facing)=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0is located. My pooja room however, is in a different location t=\r\nowards north of the house. I have a big Shiva Lingam in my pooja room for w=\r\nhich I do daily abhishekam in the morning, (with Rudra Adhyaya on Mondays).=\r\n So, if I have do both nithyapooja and homam daily, it is really time takin=\r\ng as arranging for homam takes almost 20 minutes, on a routine basis. Any i=\r\ndeas for managing this better? For instance, arrangements include, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. cleaning up the previous homam residues, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. pu=\r\ntting new aluminium foil in the homa kunda and below the homakunda, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n3. putting aluminium foils before the homa kunda where I keep the ghee so t=\r\nhat any spills would happen on the foil, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4.cleaning the Kalasa, putt=\r\ning chandan and kumkum for kalas, putting askshatas pouring water, putting =\r\na flower in the kalasa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. preparing an oil lamp\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. putting dar=\r\nbhas around the homa kunda\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 7. putting starter wood block in the homa =\r\nkunda along with camphor and darbhas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 8. melting the gree \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All these take from 15-20 minutes. If I have time, I do hav=\r\ne a ninth step of cooking some food for mahanaivedyam which takes an additi=\r\nonal 20-30 minutes. With all these, doing a homam and regular pooja in=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0a different place is really difficult on a daily basis. But I want=\r\n to do that. Any ideas for keeping it simple? \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nag=\r\nraj=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Sun, 6/26/11, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krish=\r\nnan@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Homa kunda : Iron or copper, other questions..=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Sunday, June 26, 2011, =\r\n12:06 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; namas=\r\nte,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lastly, I did not find any homam manual that goes along =\r\nwith sandhya vandanam ! Someone I respect, mentioned of AupAsana homam ...\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the past, I have asked exactly the same question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; If you are not already doing sandhyAvandana and aupAsana (and are\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n doing homa), don&#39;t worry about it. Just skip this mail altogether. If\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; you are doing sandhyAvandana, don&#39;t want to stop doing it (because of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; the guilt factor), and want to better integrate it with homa, this\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n mail may be of some limited value. I have studied several\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sandhyAvan=\r\ndana, aupAsana and homa manuals.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many traditions split sandhyA=\r\nvandana into two parts: (a) purificatory\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rites and (b) gAyatri-japa. =\r\nIf you want to integrate with homa, do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; homa between parts (a) and (b)=\r\n. The first part, with the mArjana etc\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hardly takes 1-2 minutes. Afte=\r\nr that, do the homa. After the purnahuti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc, you can do the second p=\r\nart of sandhyAvandana (gayatri japa)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; starting with the AvAhana. Spend=\r\n as much time in this meditation as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you can. Then, you can do the upa=\r\nsthAna etc, which will add another 2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; minutes or so. Consider skipping=\r\n all the elaborate nyAsas, and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; repeated prAnAyAmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nReally speaking, everything important is already there in the homa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ma=\r\nnual. From the &quot;full sandhyAvandana&quot; procedure, you can pull in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; few=\r\n veda mantras if you choose to. But, it really isn&#39;t necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; If you look at aupAsana procedures, you will find that Narasimha&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nmanual is more elaborate than the aupAsana. Homa is basically a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; super=\r\nset of aupAsana. Where the manual differs, it is more relevant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for ou=\r\nr modern lifestyle, and you don&#39;t need to add anything to it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frankly=\r\n, I basically follow Narasimha&#39;s manual, but say &quot;aupAsana&quot; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the sa=\r\nnkalpa. They are that similar. The fire in which you do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;upAsana&quot; is =\r\n&quot;aupAsana&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ajit\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
