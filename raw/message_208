Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Namaskaram anna,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I saw this movie and I cannot help responding.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; It is true that Hindus and sanatana dharma suffered badly at the \nhands o=\r\nf Muslim invaders (and other invaders), but it is wrong to \ntake out that a=\r\nnger on Akbar. Some people cannot see beyond a man&#39;s \nname and religion and=\r\n hence cannot recognize when a great celestial \nbeing is born in a differen=\r\nt religion.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Swami Vimalananda, the Aghori yogi mentioned in the &quot;Agho=\r\nra&quot; series \nbooks, is somebody who achieved the highest states of conscious=\r\nness. \nHe received a lot of knowledge directly from Mother Tara. \nAccording=\r\ning to him, Akbar and Jodha were the re-incarnation of \nSamyukta and Rajput=\r\n King Prithviraj Chouhan. As Prithviraj, he \nrepelled so many Muslim invade=\r\nrs at the border of India. When Muslims \nfinally conquered India, he was re=\r\nborn as one of them and put breaks \non their aggression and changed their w=\r\nays.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In that age, Muslim invaders engaged in barbarism, destroyed \nte=\r\nmples, libraries and other relics of native religion and culture. \nThey beh=\r\neaded Hindus who refused to convert, they raped Hindu women \nand they behea=\r\nded defeated kings. They just tried to wipe out the \nnative religion and cu=\r\nlture and replace with theirs. Akbar slowed \ndown the barbarism and aggress=\r\nion and promoted tolerance and \nintegration. He stopped the forced conversi=\r\nons, rapes and beheadings \nof Hindus. He stopped the destruction of temples=\r\n and libraries. He \ntalked about respecting other religions while following=\r\n one&#39;s own \nreligion. He even took on the mighty Muslim clerics when he abo=\r\nlished \na special tax on Hindus based on religion. He was a man of great \nc=\r\nharacter, conviction and principles and was utterly fearless. He had \naffin=\r\nity for Rajputs and was even born in a Rajput family and spent \nearly years=\r\n there. He displayed the samskaras and instincts of a \nrefined and cultured=\r\n Rajput more than those a of Mughal king - he was \nso unlike his grandfathe=\r\nr Babar, father Humayun and step-brother \nAdham.\n&gt;  \n&gt; He used to offer arg=\r\nhyas to Sun in the morning and then participate \nin a Zoroastrian fire ritu=\r\nal of Farsis (similar to our homam) and \nthen do a namaz with Muslim cleric=\r\ns. Such tolerance was unheard of \nfrom any other Muslim ruler in those days=\r\n (or perhaps even today!). \nTowards the end of his life, he even started hi=\r\ns own religion, which \nwas based on his realization and is quite noble. He =\r\nwas a spiritually \nelevated soul. Irrespective of the religion one follows,=\r\n one deserves \nour respect and admiration if one embodies the spirit of san=\r\natana \ndharma in one&#39;s thoughts and actions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Akbar was a true hero - =\r\na being who came down from a higher loka to \nfulfil a certain mission with =\r\nthe blessings of rishis. His \ncontribution to the safekeeping of sanatana d=\r\nharma is not to be \njudged from what harm his fellow Muslims inflicted on s=\r\nanatana \ndharma. His contribution is to be judged from what *more* harm to =\r\n\nsanatana dharma he helped *avoid*. If he had not come, I have no \ndoubt th=\r\nat sanatana dharma would have suffered much much more than it \ndid. That wa=\r\ns not the wish of rishis and that is why they sent \nsomebody to alter the c=\r\nourse and minimize the harm. It is unfortunate \nthat those who see the good=\r\nness of emperor Ashoka and king Shivaji \ncannot see the goodness of Akbar s=\r\nimply because he was a Muslim.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is unfortunate that some Hindus are=\r\n equating Akbar with the \nother cruel and barbaric Muslim kings. Who should=\r\n be (was) a friend \nof Hindus is being portrayed as an enemy and being shot=\r\n down. \nInstead, we should promote his story and inspire more people to be =\r\n\nlike him. He was a great inspirational figure then and should be now \ntoo.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; The epic movie &quot;Jodha Albar&quot; is a very good movie about one of the \n=\r\ngreatest and most dharmik emperors of India. The director and actor \ndid ju=\r\nstice to a man of great character that Akbar was. I am sad \nabout the mud-s=\r\nlinging that some of my fellow Hindus are engaging in. \nPlease do not assas=\r\nsinate the character of Akbar.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you want, please make movies of the=\r\n same caliber and cinematic \nexcellence on great Hindu heroes such as Chatr=\r\napati Shivaji, \nPrithviraj Chouhan, Sri Krishnadeva Raya, Vikramarka, Saliv=\r\nahana, \nAshoka, Jnaaneshwar, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Shankaracharya, \nRamakri=\r\nshna Paramahamsa, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi etc. But there \nis no need t=\r\no denigrate a fine movie made on Akbar.\n&gt;  \n&gt; These are my 2 cents on the f=\r\nire over Jodha Akbar.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.ho=\r\nme.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt;   --=\r\n--- Original Message ----- \n&gt; \n&gt;   Namaskar\n&gt; \n&gt;   This is an awareness dri=\r\nve to awake people to boycott \nmovie &#39;Jodhaa Akbar&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt;   The movie Jodha=\r\na Akbar is a vile, vicious, and covert attempt by \na mischievous producer/d=\r\nirector from Bollywood (Mumbai) to make quick \nbucks by denigrating and vil=\r\nifying the Hindu (Rajput) people.
