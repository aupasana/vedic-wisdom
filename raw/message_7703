Hence I am presenting for reading of the fellow group members:\n\nN=\r\new Year Message from Poojya Swamiji Dayananda Saraswati (Arsha Vidya Guruku=\r\nlam)\n\nThis is the beginning of a new year. We can start afresh. Whether it =\r\nis the first of January, the\nfourteenth of April, or any other time, it is =\r\nimportant. We need such an event. We require to\nhave a day or an event that=\r\n we can call a beginning. The human being is always aspiring for a\nbetter d=\r\nay, a better turn. He/she knows that what is here today may not be here tom=\r\norrow=97lay\noffs are always a possibility. If our situation is pleasant and=\r\n comfortable, we want that situation\nto continue. But if our situation is u=\r\nnpleasant or uncomfortable, we want a break. Let this new\nyear initiate a n=\r\new turn, a new beginning. The hope is always there, but it has to be imbued=\r\n with\nsome prayers.\n\nHope is on what basis? There is no basis for hope! Onl=\r\ny the human heart is hopeful. There is\nno other basis. What is the basis? B=\r\netween the heartbeats &quot;lub&quot; and &quot;dub,&quot; there is a gap. &quot;Lub.&quot; Then, if you =\r\nare allowed, &quot;dub.&quot; You are alive now, so there is &quot;lub.&quot; To let the &quot;dub&quot; =\r\ncome and then the &quot;lub&quot; come, there is grace. There is grace between the &quot;l=\r\nub&quot; and the &quot;dub.&quot; There is something that keeps us going, and that is what=\r\n hope is all about. But then the basis for hope is only prayerfulness. If w=\r\ne have a certain prayerful attitude, there is no reason why we can&#39;t hope f=\r\nor a better turn. We must aspire for it, pray for it, and work for it.\n\nOne=\r\n important thing you must know: Even though we work for certain things that=\r\n we want to\naccomplish, there is no guarantee that we will accomplish them.=\r\n It is clear that the effort we\nmake need not produce the result that we wa=\r\nnt. While watching a baseball game, the batsman\nswings the bat at the ball =\r\nand then looks out yonder for the ball. The catcher behind him has it.\n\nThe=\r\nre was no connection at all between the bat and the ball. If there is a con=\r\nnection and the ball\nkeeps traveling, it need not be a home run. It could b=\r\ne a foul ball. Then what is the use of that\nconnection? Or if it travels ou=\r\nt to the field, a player out there may catch it. That player, in fact,\nis p=\r\nrayerful that he will catch it. And the batsman is prayerful that he will n=\r\not catch it. That is\nwhy the Lord is sometimes confused. Therefore, the Lor=\r\nd occasionally obliges him and\noccasionally obliges you. \n\nNow you can unde=\r\nrstand why we sometimes win and sometimes lose. If we were always the winne=\r\nr, our competitor would always be the loser. And if the competitor were alw=\r\nays the loser, there would be no fun in competition. Where is the competiti=\r\non if one loses all the time? Therefore, everything is okay. All is well.\n\n=\r\nPrayerfulness is a pervasive attitude, an attitude that governs our life, a=\r\nn attitude that gives us an inner leisure whereby we can accommodate an unp=\r\nleasant situation, if not pleasantly, we can atleast manage it. That inner =\r\nleisure gives us the space that will enable us to face situations objective=\r\nly. And that space is provided by prayerfulness. Think of it. If we were no=\r\nt prayerful,we would always think of ourselves as losers. But we are not lo=\r\nsers because we are not the authors of the results of action.\n\nWe are the a=\r\nuthors of our actions only, not the authors of the results of our actions (=\r\nkarma phalam)=97the situations that we face. Given this fact, the most appr=\r\nopriate thing to do is to take\nwhatever result comes with an even attitude.=\r\n By not getting what we want, we become wiser. Not getting what we want doe=\r\ns not mean we have become losers. We have a choice over our actions=97we ca=\r\nn perform a given action, we need not perform it, or we can perform it\ndiff=\r\nerently=97but over the results of our actions, we have no choice whatsoever=\r\n. The author of the result of action is =EE=FAvara, the Lord. We can accept=\r\n that.\n\nWe have a choice to make an effort to the best of our ability, bank=\r\ning upon our know-how, the validity of our know-how, and the credibility of=\r\n our know-how. Banking upon that alone we\nperform action. However, that kno=\r\nw-how may not be adequate. We have to take into account all other factors, =\r\nand many of those factors are unknown. We have no knowledge of the hidden v=\r\nariables, and without knowledge of those hidden variables, how can we alway=\r\ns be a winner?\nWe cannot always be a winner! To control the hidden variable=\r\ns, what can we do? We can do! We can pray.\n\nPrayer is an action. Prayerfuln=\r\ness is an attitude. We can pray for a better turn and for the continuity of=\r\n what we have that is good. But prayer is not enough. We also need to be re=\r\nsourceful. We need to be active. We need to do. Every Hindu mother does thi=\r\ns. She is resourceful. She takes a bath in the morning and makes herself el=\r\nigible for preparing food for the family. Only she won&#39;t say, &quot;Food for the=\r\n family and food for =CE=FAvara, (naivedya).&quot; She prepares the food all rig=\r\nht, for which she makes all the effort, and then the prepared food is offer=\r\ned to =CE=FAvara. Afterwards, the family eats the pras=E2da because =CE=FAv=\r\nara doesn&#39;t take away what is offered to Him. It is a great thing.\n\nSuppose=\r\n you offered one hundred and eight modakams to &#288;ane=FAa and He stretch=\r\ned out His trunk and took all one hundred and eight. You would be talking a=\r\nbout it for three days. Then, suppose you offered modakams again the next d=\r\nay and He took them away, and also the third day&#39;s offering He took away. T=\r\nhen you will ask for &#288;ane=FAa &#39;s help=97&quot;You please help. How can I ma=\r\nke one hundred and eight modakams every day?&quot; But &#288;ane=FAa doesn&#39;t tak=\r\ne it away. Do you know why &#288;ane=FAa doesn&#39;t take away whatever you off=\r\ner Him on the plate? Since &#288;ane=FAa is over here, over there, and ever=\r\nywhere=97He is all pervasive (sarva vy=E2p=EE])=97He wouldn&#39;t know where to=\r\n keep it! So He leaves it there on the plate itself. He takes only your att=\r\nitude (bh=E2vana). Parok&#7779;a priy=E2&#7717; sarve deva&#7717; . It is b=\r\neautiful! We all understand this very well. Therefore, we make an offering =\r\nto the Lord, and then we take it back as pras=E2da.\n\nWe need to do. Doing i=\r\ns never discounted. We plan and we do. However, even if we plan and do our =\r\nhomework properly, we can still miss out on what we want to achieve. There =\r\nare a lot of slips between the cup and the lips. Also there are a lot of sl=\r\nips between the plate and the mouth and the mouth and the stomach. The food=\r\n we eat may not go to the stomach; it may go into our windpipe instead. Peo=\r\nple die because of that. They go to yama loka. This is not easy. When that =\r\nis so, we had better earn some of Bhagav=E2n&#39;s grace.\n\nPrayerfulness is not=\r\n enough. We need to be active. We need to be pragmatic. And prayer is part =\r\nof our pragmatism. What is pragmatism? When we objectively and dispassionat=\r\nely take into account all the factors and hidden variables that are there a=\r\nnd then plan and do, that is pragmatism. What can we do to control the hidd=\r\nen variables? Pray! Prayer is an action. It is religious pragmatism. That i=\r\ns the vaidika. The vaidika is religiously pragmatic. \n\nAll of us assembling=\r\n here in this hall before the Lord to begin this first day of the new year =\r\nis religious pragmatism. It is perfect! We could not begin it better. We be=\r\ngin with a prayer. On New Year&#39;s Eve many people get lost. But at least on =\r\nthe first day of the new year, we begin with a prayer so that we won&#39;t get =\r\nlost. Prayer is an action, and it has a result. The result is grace. We use=\r\n the word &quot;grace&quot; for want of a better word. But, really speaking, the resu=\r\nlt of prayer is grace. It is punya.\n\nPunya alone accounts for what we call =\r\nluck. And we earn that punya. We earn that luck. It is not that luck is som=\r\ne chance. We pile up punya so that we will neutralize all the causes for ba=\r\nd luck. The causes for bad luck are called durita. So durita k&#7779;ay=E2r=\r\ntham is the sankalpa the priests will make before beginning the p=FBja =97&quot;=\r\nTo neutralize the causes that bring about unpleasant situations and to enha=\r\nnce the causes that bring about pleasant situations, I perform\nthis ritual,=\r\n this prayer.&quot; So with the Lord&#39;s/ =CE=FAvara&#39;s/ Dak&#7779;in=E2m=FBrti&#39;s g=\r\nrace, may this new year, 2006, bring us what we want day after day and help=\r\n us avoid what we don&#39;t want. We need both. We need to avoid what we don&#39;t =\r\nwant; we need to achieve what we want; and what we have that is good we nee=\r\nd to retain (yoga k&#7779;ema). We pray for yoga k&#7779;ema. Happy New Yea=\r\nr to everybody! \n \n\n\n\n\n"}}
