While watching TV i hard that Sri VishnuSahsranams wi=\r\nll reduce the Past Life Karma along  with Present Life Problems. From past =\r\n10 Years i am reading Sri VishnuSahsranamas regularly. Three Years ago i no=\r\nticed some kind of pinning on Centre of my Head, i asked  so many people ab=\r\nout this. every body says their own opinion, i continued Reading Sahasranam=\r\nas just depending on VISHNU, Now i have simulations in between EYEBROWS and=\r\n on the TOP OF NOSE, when i went in to prayer there are lot of movements in=\r\n my Head like a ANT or some small FLY  moving above the ear to forehead fro=\r\nm both sides AND THE PINNING IS THROUHG OUT DAY and  now a days i am hearin=\r\ng non stop sound like &quot;wueeeeeeeeee&quot;, in my ears.Few days ago i asked Maste=\r\nr CVV disciple about this, he said that &quot;Stop Reading Sahasranamas, but my =\r\nwill is not accept.                                                  Can yo=\r\nu tell me what happening to me, or any OTHER REMEDY for me Sir.\n\nNamaskaram=\r\n\nBhavadhiyudu,\nHari Kishan\n\n\n"}}
