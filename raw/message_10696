I couldn&#39;t shake off the aftereffects of the\n&gt; experience. The surreal=\r\n pain, the idea of an abrupt ending of my\n&gt; unaccomplished life and the wor=\r\nry about my parents overwhelmed me to the\n&gt; core.

That was a day\n&gt; like any other with a slight difference. I was=\r\n tired, a little less\n&gt; involved than usual in the physical world, roaming =\r\nthe streets on my own\n&gt; accord, I didn&#39;t realize that I had taken a wrong t=\r\nurn towards the\n&gt; forbidden road. I didn&#39;t need to have a d=C3=A9j=C3=A0 vu=\r\n to understand the\n&gt; happenings around me.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;So, this is it&quot;, I thought.=\r\n In a way, I had accepted it and since I had\n&gt; had plenty of time to prepar=\r\ne, I was sure of the best possible outcome.\n&gt; Nobody can cheat death so it =\r\nwas pointless to even try. Things hurriedly\n&gt; moved forward the way they we=\r\nre supposed to and there she was exactly as I\n&gt; had seen her in my vision.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Beauty is to be admired. Amazing beauty, like hers, can make the time s=\r\nlow\n&gt; down. And it did. In the distance, I could hear the roar of a powerfu=\r\nl\n&gt; engine - cracking, uneven sound - approaching me at a thundering speed.=\r\n I\n&gt; could feel my skin collide with the air displaced by a voluminous obje=\r\nct.\n&gt; My heart was pounding with all its might, as if it was trying to beat=\r\n as\n&gt; many times as it would have, had it not been its time to prematurely =\r\nstop.\n&gt;\n&gt; Beauty is to die for. I took a deep breath, probably my last, and=\r\n gazed\n&gt; upon her face one last time. One must think about something very b=\r\neautiful\n&gt; in their last moments.
