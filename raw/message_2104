The correct pronunciation is to start saying\n&gt; &gt; &quot;hreeng&quot; and st=\r\nop just when you are about to say &quot;g&quot;. The sound &quot;g&quot;\n&gt; &gt; should not be expl=\r\nicit at all. To pronounce that nasal &quot;n(g)&quot; correctly,\n&gt; &gt; you have to thin=\r\nk that you are going to say &quot;ng&quot;, but stop just short of\n&gt; &gt; &quot;g&quot;. It is not=\r\n easy. Most people end up pronouncing the &quot;g&quot; sound a bit.\n&gt; &gt; Instead of m=\r\naking that mistake, it is better to just stick to &quot;hreem&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bott=\r\nomline: The forms hreem and hreen(g) with a silent g are both\n&gt; &gt; fine.
