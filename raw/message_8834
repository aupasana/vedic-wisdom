The stars have no conscious benevolence or animosity=\r\n; they merely send forth positive and negative radiations. Of themselves, t=\r\nhese do not help or harm humanity, but offer a lawful channel for the outwa=\r\nrd operation of cause-effect equilibriums which each man has set into motio=\r\nn in the past.\n\n&quot;A child is born on that day and at that hour when the cele=\r\nstial rays are in mathematical harmony with his individual karma. His horos=\r\ncope is a challenging portrait, revealing his unalterable past and its prob=\r\nable future results. But the natal chart can be rightly interpreted only by=\r\n men of intuitive wisdom: these are few.\n\n&quot;The message boldly blazoned acro=\r\nss the heavens at the moment of birth is not meant to emphasize fate=97the =\r\nresult of past good and evil=97but to arouse man&#39;s will to escape from his =\r\nuniversal thralldom. What he has done, he can undo. None other than himself=\r\n was the instigator of the causes of whatever effects are now prevalent in =\r\nhis life. He can overcome any limitation, because he created it by his own =\r\nactions in the first place, and because he has spiritual resources which ar=\r\ne not subject to planetary pressure.\n\n&quot;Superstitious awe of astrology makes=\r\n one an automaton, slavishly dependent on mechanical guidance. The wise man=\r\n defeats his planets=97which is to say, his past=97by transferring his alle=\r\ngiance from the creation to the Creator. The more he realizes his unity wit=\r\nh Spirit, the less he can be dominated by matter. The soul is ever-free; it=\r\n is deathless because birthless. It cannot be regimented by stars.\n\n*** Ext=\r\nracts from: Autobiography of a Yogi - by Paramhansa Yogananda\n16th Chapter:=\r\n Outwitting the Stars ***\n\n\n"}}
