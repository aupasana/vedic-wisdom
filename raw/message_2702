I can focus better at night compared to day time.\n\nWhen I do ho=\r\nmam during night:\n*) No time pressure\n*) No distractions\n*) With darkness a=\r\nround (I usually switch off lights or do it in the terrace), the only brigh=\r\nt light comes from homam helps me keep focussed on Homam (particularly afte=\r\nr I stopped referring to notes for any mantras)\n\nOnly catch I see is after =\r\npoornahuti, while doing japam, I loose the count and do not know if I am co=\r\nntinuing to do japam or asleep, then suddenly realise my state and continue=\r\n the japam. But, as long as I am vocal, I am not facing any problem with my=\r\n focus.\n\nI normally do my homams late (Between 10 pm and 3 am).\n\nI am able =\r\nto judge if I am able to do homam with attention or not. But, how do I judg=\r\ne if I am having any sattwa?\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; If yo=\r\nu can do homam with attention and some sattwa (whatever *you* can \n&gt; manage=\r\n), anytime is fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; As night progresses, the quality of sattwa goes do=\r\nwn in Nature and tamas \n&gt; increases. If your inherent sattwa is not high en=\r\nough to resist the tamas \n&gt; outside, you may not be able to focus the mind =\r\non the ritual well and be \n&gt; alert.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doing it after sunset is fine. But=\r\n I suggest not waiting till late in the \n&gt; night and doing it as early as p=\r\nossible. If you do very late, there is NO \n&gt; harm. But simply the benefit m=\r\nay be les, if there is an additional layer of \n&gt; tamas on your consciousnes=\r\ns due to the Nature of time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once I witnessed a Ganapathi homam perfor=\r\nmed in the backyard of a priest&#39;s \n&gt; house, next to a river, late in the ni=\r\nght. There were four really good \n&gt; priests there and it was one of the mos=\r\nt pleasant Ganapathi homams I \n&gt; witnessed. IF you have enough sattwa to mi=\r\nx with the quality of gunas in \n&gt; Nature during night, it can generate a di=\r\nfferent kind of nice feeling. Only \n&gt; thing is that not much happens if the=\r\nre is very little sattwa in you \n&gt; inherently.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; D=\r\no a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri T=\r\narpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http=\r\n://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyo=\r\ntishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.=\r\norg\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;homamstudent&quot; &lt;vedichoroscope@..=\r\n.&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, September 30, 20=\r\n09 10:21 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Time to do Homam\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Narasimhaj=\r\ni,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I do a daily homam in the morning before leaving for work but so=\r\nmetimes \n&gt; &gt; due to time constraints it is not possible and in that case I =\r\ncome back \n&gt; &gt; from work and perform the homam in the evening.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is t=\r\nhere a time in the day beyond which performing a homam is not advised \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsuch as sunset, etc?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Veenu\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
