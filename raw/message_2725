It is \nneither necessary not sufficient to focus on ANY chakra for Kundalini to \nrise. For example, a true Kundalini awakening experience was described in \nthe following mail. That person was not meditating/focusing on ANY chakra \nand he actually never thinks in terms of chakras. He just meditated with a \nVeda mantra and focused the mind on the mantra and a deity that he is \nattached to.\n\nOn Kundalini (Re: Re: Urdhwa-Retas) - message 1476\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1476\n\nIrrespective of what one is focusing on, Kundalini goes from Moolaadhaara to \nSwaadhishthaana to Manipoora to Anaahata and so on. That order if fixed. \nKundalini will leave a chakra and go to the next chakra if and only if one&#39;s \nnotion of &quot;I&quot; is free from certain things at that time. Leaving each chakra \nhas different requirements and has do with the corresponding element and \nlimitations represented by it. As long as your self-awareness is \ncharacterized by the qualities represented by Moolaadhaara , Kundalini \ncannot advance from Moolaadhaara.\n\nIntense focus on something (e.g. a mantra or a deity) may free one \ntemporarily from the limitations represented by a chakra, enabling Kundalini \nto leave the chakra. If Kundalini left Moolaadhaara chakra, it does not mean \nthe person was (or should be) meditating on Moolaadhaara chakra or \nSwaadhishthaana chakra. THAT is irrelevant. What is relevant instead is \nwhether the person overcame the limitations represented by Moolaadhaara \nchakra. Same with other chakras.\n\n*        *        *\n\nLet us go back to the order of elements:\n\nApart from Upanishads, Vasishtha clearly mentions in Yoga Vaasishtham that \ncreation order is ether, air, fire, water and earth and dissolution order is \nthe reverse. When earth, water, fire, air and finally ether are dissolved, \nVasishtha says that cosmic space remains. This is the same thing that Nitish \nwas quoting as &quot;super ether&quot;, but it is not considered as an &quot;element&quot; by \nVasishtha. When that too is dissolved, one merges in Brahman. From Brahman \ncomes the cosmic space and from it come the five elements.\n\nSahasrara chakra represents Brahman. Here there is no ego principle (I-ness \nor ahamkara) and no objectification. Aajnaa chakra represents the cosmic \nspace which is accompanied by the concept of Time. The ego principle \n(I-ness) is active here and there is a sense of I, but it is very subtle and \nhas not yet expanded. When this ego principle expands, element of ether is \ncreated from it and later air, fire, water and earth are created. Chakras \nfrom Visuddhi to Moolaadhaara represent ether to earth.\n\nThe creation of five elements from the cosmic space is explained by \nshastras, but how Brahman gave rise to cosmic space and Time (where there is \nobjectification and I-ness) is mysterious. Cosmic space and Time represent \nthe early stages of the field of duality, while Brahman represents \nnon-duality. The transition between the two involves several stages that are \nmysterious.\n\nCorrespondingly, there are several secretive chakras in between Sahasraara \nchakra and Aajnaa chakra. They are at the top of the forehead and at the top \nof the head.\n\nWhether it makes sense to you or not, some great yogis consider some of \nthose chakras to be better than Sahasraara. In Sahasraara, there is no \nI-ness, no objects and no experience. In the secretive chakras just under \nit, there is a very subtle I-ness, there are objects and very subtle \nexperiences. There is some &quot;rasa&quot; (juice/experience) to be had by I-ness \nhere.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI cannot recommend any text on Kundalini as definitive. &quot;The Serpent Power: \nShat chakra Nirupana&quot; by Arthur Avalon (Sir John Woodruff - sp?) is \nconsidered a good text, but I honestly did not find it valuable. It is just \ntheoretical. Manish values Vimalananda very highly and asked me to buy \n&quot;Kundalini&quot; by Robert Svoboda. He told me, &quot;though not perfect, this is the \nbest book you can find these days on the subject. Whether you read it or \nnot, buy it so that you can later compare notes with what you experience.&quot; \nWhatever I have learnt experientially so far is quite consistent with the \nsimple and lucid ideas represented in that book.\n\nOf course, various upanishads and works of Shankaracharya will give you a \nclearer perspective on some issues and enhance your internal understanding.\n\n*        *        *\n\nShankaracharya said in &quot;bhaja govindam&quot; composition: &quot;O fool, pray to \nGovinda tirelessly. When your time&#39;s up, all this knowledge and these \ntechnicalities aren&#39;t going to save you.&quot; Moreover, different people \nsometimes think in different terms and misunderstand others. It is like a \nPascal language programmer reading C language software, guessing what it \nmeans and reporting bugs based on wrong understanding of the language.\n\nIt is with a sense of discomfort and amusement that I write about these \ntechnical matters these days. I suppose I have to deal with these \ntechnicalities because some important people that I care about are \ninterested in these technicalities at this point of time.\n\nIf people just do homam or japam or whatever sadhana they chose and focus \nall of their mental energy on their chosen deity, it will be more useful...\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, October 02, 2009 2:24 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Order of Creation, Physics & Reality\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n&gt;\n&gt; What exactly is your proof that effacing of tattwas/chakras must be \n&gt; pursued in serial order? The well known Pt. Gopi Krishna, who only \n&gt; meditated on Sahasrara (crown of his head) had the experience appended \n&gt; below, please read if you havent seen it earlier. Also what is your proof \n&gt; that meditating on a chakra effaces it - this is not obvious - why might \n&gt; it not intensify it while purifying it? Is there any definitive text on \n&gt; Kundalini (Sat cakra nirupana is just too broad and symbolic for me)..\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt;\n&gt; Gopi Krishna:\n&gt; &quot;Over a period of years, he developed the ability to sit for a period of \n&gt; hours in concentration without any discomfort. The following account which \n&gt; took place in 1937 describes his first Kundalini experience which occurred \n&gt; while he was visualizing &quot;an imaginary Lotus in full bloom, radiating \n&gt; light&quot; at the crown of his head.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Suddenly, with a roar like that of a waterfall, I felt a stream of \n&gt; liquid light entering my brain through the spinal cord.\n&gt;\n&gt;    Entirely unprepared for such a development, I was completely taken by \n&gt; surprise; but regaining my self-control, keeping my mind on the point of \n&gt; concentration. The illumination grew brighter and brighter, the roaring \n&gt; louder, I experienced a rocking sensation and then felt myself slipping \n&gt; out of my body, entirely enveloped in a halo of light. It is impossible to \n&gt; describe the experience accurately. I felt the point of consciousness that \n&gt; was myself growing wider surrounded by waves of light. It grew wider and \n&gt; wider, spreading outward while the body, normally the immediate object of \n&gt; its perception, appeared to have receded into the distance until I became \n&gt; entirely unconscious of it. I was now all consciousness without any \n&gt; outline, without any idea of corporeal appendage, without any feeling or \n&gt; sensation coming from the senses, immersed in a sea of light \n&gt; simultaneously conscious and aware at every point, spread out, as it were, \n&gt; in all directions without any barrier or material obstruction. I was no \n&gt; longer myself, or to be more accurate, no longer as I knew myself to be, a \n&gt; small point of awareness confined to a body, but instead was a vast circle \n&gt; of consciousness in which the body was but a point, bathed in light and in \n&gt; a state of exultation and happiness impossible to describe.\n&gt;    Krishna, Pandit Gopi, Kundalini: Path to Higher Consciousness (New \n&gt; Delhi: Orient Paperbacks, 1992), pps. 6-7 &quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a body that looks and feels \n&gt;&gt; in a particular way physically. Apart from the physical aspect, one may \n&gt;&gt; think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has certain qualities, certain needs, certain \n&gt;&gt; belongings etc. All those concepts one has about who one is, form one&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; self-awareness and Kundalini represents that self-awareness. Kundalini \n&gt;&gt; cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature \n&gt;&gt; within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. Kundalini \n&gt;&gt; cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* or \n&gt;&gt; *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still \n&gt;&gt; remaining. And so on.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Many people who talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are \n&gt;&gt; often talking merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras \n&gt;&gt; (which may still be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced \n&gt;&gt; Kundalini actually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, \n&gt;&gt; one will not perceive a solid body, one will not have notions of owning \n&gt;&gt; anything. Similarly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each element is \n&gt;&gt; effaced in one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is, at the physical as well \n&gt;&gt; as the subtle level of existence! To completely efface even one element \n&gt;&gt; (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of \n&gt;&gt; time, is not at all easy.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The order in which elements are effaced as one progresses towards samadhi \n&gt;&gt; is - earth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again comes down, \n&gt;&gt; effaced elements return to work in the reverse order - ether, air, fire, \n&gt;&gt; water and earth.\n\n\n"}}
