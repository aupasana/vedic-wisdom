Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First of all, our current understanding of arrivi=\r\nng at ishta \ndevata\n&gt; from \n&gt; &gt; horoscope is not perfect.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Secondly=\r\n, the way ishta devata may work is complex. The role of\n&gt; ishta devata \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n is to give moksha. Moksha is the state of non-distinction between\n&gt; object=\r\ns of \n&gt; &gt; universe. &quot;Supreme cosmic being&quot; (known by various names) is the\n=\r\n&gt; observer of \n&gt; &gt; all with non-distinction and the gate to moksha. Several=\r\n deities \nplay \n&gt; &gt; specific roles in the universe at the lower level and b=\r\necome one \nwith \n&gt; &gt; supreme cosmic being at a higher level. Accordingly, o=\r\nne may start\n&gt; praying \n&gt; &gt; to a specific form of a deity with a specific r=\r\nole in the \nuniverse,\n&gt; later \n&gt; &gt; realize a higher form of the deity and t=\r\nhen become liberated \nthrough\n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; higher form.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For this re=\r\nason, some (especially some gurus at Sri Jagannath\n&gt; Centre) even \n&gt; &gt; say =\r\nthat only Vishnu&#39;s incarnations can be ishta devatas giving\n&gt; moksha and \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; other deities cannot be. This is partly logical, but based on a \n&gt; &gt; mis=\r\nconception. Vishnu here refers to sarva vyaapakeswara (all-\npervading \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nlord). If one realizes an all-pervading form of Ganesha or Surya \nor\n&gt; Laks=\r\nhmi \n&gt; &gt; or Kaali or Shiva or Subrahmanya, then too that form qualifies as =\r\n\nishta \n&gt; &gt; devata who enables moksha (liberation). For example, Ganapathi =\r\n\nAtharva \n&gt; &gt; Seersham describes a supreme cosmic being form of Ganapathi, =\r\nfrom \nwhom \n&gt; &gt; Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva come. Suryopanishat describes a su=\r\npreme \ncosmic \n&gt; &gt; being form of Surya, from whom Brahma, Vishn and Shiva c=\r\nome. And \nso on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One may start with the worship of Ganesha who rem=\r\noves obstacles \nand\n&gt; finally \n&gt; &gt; realize a form of Ganesha that is beyond=\r\n gunas and from whom \nBrahma,\n&gt; Vishnu, \n&gt; &gt; Shiva, Surya, Agni, Vaayu etc =\r\nare born. One may start with the\n&gt; worship of \n&gt; &gt; Lakshmi who gives prospe=\r\nrity and money and finally realize a form \nof\n&gt; Lakshmi \n&gt; &gt; who drives the=\r\n thoughts and actions of all beings. One may start\n&gt; with the \n&gt; &gt; worship =\r\nof Saraswati who gives knowledge and finally realize a \nform of \n&gt; &gt; Sarasw=\r\nati who is the root of all creation.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thus, one starts worshipping =\r\none&#39;s ishta devata and slowly \nevolves to \n&gt; &gt; worshipping a higher all-per=\r\nvading form of that deity, who may\n&gt; sometimes \n&gt; &gt; seem like a different d=\r\neity to a casual observer. This is the \nnatural \n&gt; &gt; process of evolution.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Saptashati rahasya associated with sa=\r\nptashati (Chandipath) \ndescribes\n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; process of creation. It says th=\r\nat first there was Mahalakshmi with\n&gt; three \n&gt; &gt; gunas. She divided herself=\r\n into 3 parts - Mahakali with tamas \n(ichchhaa \n&gt; &gt; sakti - the force behin=\r\nd desire), Mahalakshmi with sattwa (jnaana\n&gt; sakti - \n&gt; &gt; the force behind =\r\nknowledge) and Mahasaraswati (kriyaa sakti - the \nforce \n&gt; &gt; behind action)=\r\n with rajas. The 3 parts of Chandipath are devoted \nto the \n&gt; &gt; three.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Thus, trigunatmika Mahalakshmi is the root energy driving the \n&gt; &gt; des=\r\nires/thoughts, knowledge/perception and actions of all beings \nin\n&gt; this \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; universe.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In fact, chapter 11 towards the end of Chandipath pra=\r\nys to Devi \n(divine \n&gt; &gt; Mother) after all her exploits and addresses Her i=\r\nn the prayer as \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Naaraayani&quot; (energy of Narayana). If one views Naaraa=\r\nyana as\n&gt; supreme cosmic \n&gt; &gt; being from whom Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva came=\r\n, trigunatmika\n&gt; Mahalakshami (or \n&gt; &gt; Narayani) is his energy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\nus, the Divine Mother of Chandipath is not really different \nfrom \n&gt; &gt; Maha=\r\nlakshmi I have been worshipping for many years. I originally\n&gt; started out =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; worshipping Lakshmi with 4 hands who sita on a lotus and gives \nmoney.=\r\n I \n&gt; &gt; later realized that a higher form of the same deity is the energy \n=\r\nof \n&gt; &gt; Narayana (supreme cosmic being) and She is responsible for the \nbir=\r\nth, \n&gt; &gt; sustenance and destruction of all beings including Brahma, Vishnu\n=\r\n&gt; and Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whichever deity you are =\r\nattached to and worship as your ishta\n&gt; devata, please \n&gt; &gt; try to imagine =\r\nthat deity as the all-pervading supreme cosmic \nbeing\n&gt; from \n&gt; &gt; whom the =\r\nentire creation evolves.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ---------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Ho=\r\nmam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yo=\r\nurself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ved=\r\nicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJag=\r\nannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;raj=\r\narshi14@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, Januar=\r\ny 15, 2009 11:44 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Question on Istha devata to=\r\n Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was reading up on=\r\n the old mail about how your started doign \nChandi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Homa.
