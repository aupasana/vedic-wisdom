They are worshipped mostly \nin Mahara=\r\nstra in India. Those who know Marathi can read the NavNath Bhaktisar. \nThat=\r\n text is not a mere book but a powerful scripture, doing parayana of which =\r\n\ncan give serious spiritual benefits. There are some very old books in Beng=\r\nali \ntoo which speak of the Nath. I am yet to trace those books. But authen=\r\ntic \nsources tell me so. For example the name of Chowrungee in Calcutta is =\r\nbased on \nthe name of Chowrungee Nath.\n\n\nIn Nepal, Goraksha and MatsyendraN=\r\nath are considered to be household deities. \nComing to Maharastra, the Nav =\r\nNath Bhaktisar details stories of all the 9 nath, \ntheir origin and their l=\r\nives. Lineages of the Nath are found in plenty and \nmaximum=C2=A0in Maharas=\r\ntra. This is infact considered to be Nath Bhoomi. Krishna \ndecided to come =\r\ndown as Dyaneshwar, and 9 spiritual giants came along with him \nto work. Th=\r\nese were the Nath.\n\nIn Buddhism for example, MatsyendraNath who is the guru=\r\n of GorakshaNath is \nassociated with Avalokiteshwara Bodhisatva. \n\n\nThere a=\r\nre Kan-phattas who consider themselves to be of the lineage of Naths. \nThey=\r\n pierce their earlobes as a process of initiation. Similarly there are many=\r\n \nwandering mendicants and Aghoris who also trace their lineage to the Nath=\r\ns.\n\nTo say the X or Y Ashram in Z place is the only lineage of a Nath is ba=\r\nsed on a \nfallacious understanding of the spiritual potency of a Nath. \n\n\nJ=\r\nust like many ignorant people believe that the only Aghoris in the world ar=\r\ne \npresent in Kasi in Kinnaram Aghoris lineage. That is a misconception.Tha=\r\nt is one \nlineage, but=C2=A0more are there which may or may not be in publi=\r\nc view.=C2=A0Similarly, \nthe tradition of the Naths - who were super Aghori=\r\ns - are varied and myriard.=C2=A0\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi=C2=A0\n\n\n\n_______=\r\n_________________________\nFrom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nTo: Vin=\r\nay Jha &lt;vinayjhaa@...&gt;\nCc: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Mon, 13=\r\n December, 2010 9:37:08 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Gorakhnath, Naths an=\r\nd Dattatreya (Re: On Physical \nImmortality)\n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaste friends,\n\nI am=\r\n forwarding a mail from Vinay ji that was cc&#39;ed to vedic-wisdom but not \nde=\r\nlivered due to non-membership.\n\nNamaste Vinay ji,\n\n&gt; In your message above,=\r\n I read &quot;I am the body&quot;.

I cannot open y=\r\nahoo groups. When I\n&gt; get a good internet connection, I may try to see vedi=\r\nc-wisdom.\n&gt;\n&gt; I like to hear and read spiritual talks by others, but I real=\r\nly\n&gt; dislike describing my experiences. The reason is simple : most of the\n=\r\n&gt; persons will not believe and therefore it will serve no worthwhile\n&gt; purp=\r\nose. In your message above, I read &quot;I am the body&quot;. This feeling\n&gt; is what =\r\nI endeavoured to overcome through Tapa for years. Due to my\n&gt; efforts of se=\r\nlf-purification, which included overcoming Deep Sleep and\n&gt; ensure constant=\r\n Japa even throughout night, I was blessed with the\n&gt; visits of many deitie=\r\ns and siddhas and it will be foolish to describe\n&gt; these experiences to eve=\r\nrone. I was gaining some siddhis, but I left\n&gt; that road due to some unsavo=\r\nury incidents. The only siddhi, if you can\n&gt; call it a siddhi, that I gaine=\r\nd through Tapa and Blessings and which I\n&gt; want to keep is my enhanced capa=\r\ncity to judge things, books, persons\n&gt; and events. Earlier, I wasted years =\r\ntorn in the horns of the dilemma\n&gt; of to be or not to be a part of the fals=\r\ne melodrama known as Samsaara,\n&gt; lingering in the labyrinths of Doubts of a=\r\nll sorts. I got the correct\n&gt; answer later : To be AND not to be at the sam=\r\ne time. To be, but with a\n&gt; Saaksheebhaava. To watch not only others, but o=\r\nur own actions and\n&gt; thoughts, dreams, etc, as a mere Onlooker and not as a=\r\n participant;\n&gt; hence Not to be too. Shri Mad-Bhaagavata says : &quot;aashaa hi =\r\nparamam\n&gt; duHkham, nairaashyam paramam sukham&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; One personal experience=\r\n I want to share is that the Ego I was thinking\n&gt; as my real Self got detac=\r\nhed from me long ago, but I have not got good\n&gt; riddance from it : it now a=\r\nbuses me but I do not care for it. I\n&gt; sometimes keep a pretence of Ego to =\r\ndeal with worldly persons, but the\n&gt; real Ego is a detached powerless entit=\r\ny watched by me. Years ago, once\n&gt; I felt my existence sinking down at nigh=\r\nt. I asked my\n&gt; Upastha/Jananendriya to come up; it answered : Brahmaa ji m=\r\nade my\n&gt; place at bottom, how can I come up?? Then I realized my folly. The=\r\n\n&gt; Praana should come up. Others may laugh at me, but the fact is that I\n&gt; =\r\ncould hear my indriyas and could talk to them as if they were separate\n&gt; be=\r\nings!! I gradually realized that they accompany me from time\n&gt; immemorial, =\r\nbut I do not really belong to them, or to this ephemeral\n&gt; Body.\n&gt; This is =\r\nthe real Siddhi we should all strive for : Seal-realization.\n&gt; Japa, tapa, =\r\nhomam, dhyaana, etc are all means. The end is Constant\n&gt; Self-Awareness, aw=\r\nareness of the real Self which is omnipresent,\n&gt; omniscient, disinrested an=\r\nd detached, yet one with everone. Veda does\n&gt; not differentiate between ind=\r\nividual soul and God. Last verse of White\n&gt; YV : &quot;yo asau Aaditya purushaH =\r\nso asau aham&quot;. This normal state of\n&gt; Atman is sama-aadhi, opposed to egois=\r\ntical state which is Vyaadhi.\n&gt; Both states can be easily attained and reta=\r\nined, provided constant\n&gt; practice is made. Vyaadhi or Vyutthaana is easier=\r\n due to past habits\n&gt; of mind and indriyas. That is why Tapa is required fo=\r\nr Samaadhi.\n&gt; Samaadhi needs statue-like fixation of the body as well as of=\r\n the\n&gt; mind, which can be attained only through Tapa for normal humans. But=\r\n\n&gt; most of the mortals in Kaliyuga want shortcuts to evade Tapa. They do\n&gt; =\r\nnot know that real Dhyaana is a painful Tapa till it becomes a normal\n&gt; hab=\r\nit of the purified mind, after which dhyaana opens the road to\n&gt; Bliss. No =\r\nworldly pleasue can be compared to the siritual bliss when\n&gt; Soul is Itself=\r\n and Only Itself.\n&gt; -vj\n&gt;\n&gt; On 12/12/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am forwarding the reply from Sri Vi=\r\nnay Jha, a monk in north India. Though\n&gt; &gt; he cc&#39;ed his reply to vedic-wisd=\r\nom, it was not delivered because he is not a\n&gt; &gt; member. So I am forwarding=\r\n it (see below).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To members: In my limited interactions with him ov=\r\ner the last few months, I\n&gt; &gt; have seen that he is a man with good understa=\r\nnding and clear thinking. I\n&gt; &gt; usually do not have any significant disagre=\r\nement with him in spiritual\n&gt; &gt; matters. Any difference between what we say=\r\n is often because we may be using\n&gt; &gt; different words or looking at things =\r\nfrom different angles, but not because\n&gt; &gt; of fundamental differences.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Vinay ji summarized it beautifully:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Body is primarily a means =\r\nto fulfil desires. Those who have conquered\n&gt; &gt;&gt; desires are in no need of =\r\nbody. But then they get siddhis!! What an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; irony ! Those who run after =\r\nsiddhis do not get anything.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ... Striving after siddhis is the greates=\r\nt folly. Siddhis are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; actually distractions which test the power of a y=\r\nogi to concenrrate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All kinds of siddhi are possible. They should n=\r\neither be avoided nor\n&gt; &gt; pursued. Take what comes your way, but do not des=\r\nire anything. There should\n&gt; &gt; be NOTHING that you hold as &quot;I wish I had th=\r\nis&quot; or &quot;I wish I did NOT have\n&gt; &gt; this&quot;, for any attraction or aversion wil=\r\nl block you! As Vinay ji rightly\n&gt; &gt; says, the irony is that one running af=\r\nter siddhis is often deprived of any,\n&gt; &gt; while one without desires may be =\r\ntempted with this siddhi or that siddhi so\n&gt; &gt; that desire may be reborn! O=\r\nnly after one passes all tests and attraction\n&gt; &gt; and aversion are not born=\r\n in any circumstances is one truly free. The above\n&gt; &gt; paragraph is a good =\r\nsummary of this discussion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vinay ji is wise in not w=\r\nanting to talk about personal experiences. I share\n&gt; &gt; a few of them as the=\r\ny are useful in highlighting some notions and some\n&gt; &gt; lessons and in inspi=\r\nring and cautioning sadhakas. I am quoting a portion\n&gt; &gt; from http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------ Begin Quot=\r\ne ------------\n&gt; &gt; I was sleeping oneday. In the middle of the night, I wok=\r\ne up. When I was\n&gt; &gt; still on the bed and partially awake, my shakti rose. =\r\nIn other words, my\n&gt; &gt; self-awareness got refined. I first perceived a trem=\r\nendous bolt of\n&gt; &gt; electricity going up in my back. Then, in a split second=\r\n, my perception of\n&gt; &gt; that electricity changed from &quot;shakti inside me&quot; to =\r\n&quot;I inside shakti&quot;. My\n&gt; &gt; changed perception was that there was a tremendou=\r\ns amount of shakti that was\n&gt; &gt; surging up like an ocean wave and encompass=\r\ning everything that was there and\n&gt; &gt; that I was a very tiny particle in th=\r\nat tremendous wave. Moreover, I also\n&gt; &gt; &quot;heard&quot; a specific beejaakshara be=\r\ning chanted together by millions of\n&gt; &gt; people, who were all tiny particles=\r\n in that wave. That wave reverberated\n&gt; &gt; with the sound of that beejaaksha=\r\nra and I perceived that I too was chanting\n&gt; &gt; that beejaakshara along with=\r\n all. My mind was filled with that sound and a\n&gt; &gt; kind of bliss. My self-a=\r\nwareness was that of a tiny particle filled with\n&gt; &gt; that sound and joy and=\r\n nothing else. I was unaware of anything else.\n&gt; &gt; Compared to my normal me=\r\nntal state, it was a very simple and yet fantastic\n&gt; &gt; state to be in. I wa=\r\ns in that state for a while. Suddenly a thought that can\n&gt; &gt; be loosely exp=\r\nressed as &quot;Amn&#39;t I on the bed in a room? How am I hearing this\n&gt; &gt; loud sou=\r\nnd? Are there people in the room&quot; came to my mind. That thought\n&gt; &gt; disturb=\r\ned the state of my mind and my shakti came down. In other words, I\n&gt; &gt; retu=\r\nrned to the regular level of self-awareness and again perceived that I\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwas a body lying on a bed in a room. The bliss was gone and mind was again\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; filled with hundreds of thoughts as usual.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I mentioned this inc=\r\nident a few days later to Manish. When this happened, it\n&gt; &gt; was the middle=\r\n of the night for me and morning for Manish. When I mentioned\n&gt; &gt; the incid=\r\nent and said that I heard the sound of a beejaakshara reverberating\n&gt; &gt; in =\r\nthe wave in which I was a small particle, Manish immediately said he knew\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; it and also mentioned the specific beejaakshara and asked &quot;that is what =\r\nyou\n&gt; &gt; heard, right?&quot; That was indeed correct. Moreover, I had never medit=\r\nated with\n&gt; &gt; that beejaakshara before and it is not something one would ex=\r\npect me to have\n&gt; &gt; a mystical experience with.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When I confirmed th=\r\nat was the beejaakshara I heard, Manish shed some light:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I was at that=\r\n time meditating with that beejaakshara. So and so deity came\n&gt; &gt; and fille=\r\nd my consciousness. I then went into a nice samadhi. Some people\n&gt; &gt; close =\r\nto me may also have experienced that deity at that time. But we should\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nrealize that this is all Her play and we are just nimittas. What she does\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; and why she does, she knows and we do not. We are just dummies observing=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; what comes our way. We neither make anything happen nor should we desi=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; anything to happen. Just be and observe. Do not be attracted or repe=\r\nlled by\n&gt; &gt; anything.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ------------- End Quote -------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ma=\r\nking someone who is thousands of miles away (especially one who is leading\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; a normal mundane life and has many bad samskaras!) have a specific subl=\r\nime\n&gt; &gt; experience is not an ordinary feat. Few can do such things today. H=\r\nowever,\n&gt; &gt; look at the attitude of the person who did it. See what he said=\r\n in the last\n&gt; &gt; paragraph quoted above about being just a nimitta! Rather =\r\nthan thinking of\n&gt; &gt; siddhis or striving for them, strive for cultivating s=\r\nuch an attitude!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The important thing is not whether one gets siddhi=\r\ns or not. That is\n&gt; &gt; irrelevant. The important thing is whether one is ful=\r\nly prepared and mature\n&gt; &gt; enough to handle any siddhis! If one is prepared=\r\n, one may get control over\n&gt; &gt; the entire universe and yet remain detached =\r\nand be liberated. If one is\n&gt; &gt; unprepared, even a very very minor siddhi m=\r\nay make one fall and get stuck in\n&gt; &gt; the cycle of birth, pursuit of desire=\r\ns and paybacks and death. Sadhakas\n&gt; &gt; should forget about irrelevant thing=\r\ns and strive for the correct attitude\n&gt; &gt; that can take them far.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; B=\r\nest regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Wri=\r\ntings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpan=\r\na:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedi=\r\nc-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWriting=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; D=\r\nate: Sun, 12 Dec 2010 00:05:35 +0530\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Gorakhnath, Naths an=\r\nd Dattatreya (Re: On Physical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Immortality)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Vinay Jha &lt;vinay=\r\njhaa@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cc: vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,\n&gt; &gt; silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt;,=\r\n Lalit Mishra\n&gt; &gt; &lt;mishra.lalit@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; PVR=\r\n is correctly expressing the essence of Vedic philosophy, but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; physical=\r\n immortality and greater miracles are possible by siddhas.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Swami Ramak=\r\nrishna Paramhamsa&#39;s guru Swami Totapuri deliberately left\n&gt; &gt;&gt; his body aft=\r\ner completing one Divine Year on Earth, equal to 360 human\n&gt; &gt;&gt; years. One =\r\nof his disciples whom I knew personally requested the guru\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not to leav=\r\ne his discipes, but Totapuri ji said that though he could\n&gt; &gt;&gt; live as long=\r\n as he wishes, this world is not for siddhas. There is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; another world f=\r\nor them.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I know siddha of Nath sampradaya now living in the Shiva Temp=\r\nle near\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a creamation ground in Jammu. He can create matter out of noth=\r\ning, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; talk from great distances telepathically. I know some siddhas=\r\n of other\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sampradaayas too. None of them wants physical immortality, b=\r\nut it is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; attainable.

The whole\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Creation is a Kalpa.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nBody is primarily a means to fulfil desires. Those who have conquered\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\ndesires are in no need of body. But then they get siddhis!! What an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ir=\r\nony ! Those who run after siddhis do not get anything.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have some exp=\r\nerience of these things, but I do not like to talk\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about personal expe=\r\nriences. It is wrong to say that Jnaana or Kriya\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yogacannot bring sidd=\r\nhis. All types of real Yoga can bring siddhis.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But as the saying goes,=\r\n those who strive to become saints become\n&gt; &gt;&gt; satans. Striving after siddh=\r\nis is the greatest folly. Siddhis are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; actually distractions which test=\r\n the power of a yogi to concenrrate.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -vj\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On 12/11/10, N=\r\narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Ple=\r\nase do not get carried away with this verse. Naths are also known as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Mahasiddhas. These are not ordinary beings. Nath means Lord or master.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Depending on how you count them, there are either 64 or 9 of them,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; incarnated from various transcendental qualities of the Lord. These are\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; adept beings with perfect mastery over various aspects of the field =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duality. They are ever-liberated and yet are born again and again=\r\n to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; show\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the path of liberation to people.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Lord=\r\n Dattatreya is the original guru of all Naths. Please read his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Avad=\r\nhoota Gita&quot;. There is a nice English translation by Swami\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Asokananda=\r\n (I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; think) of Ramakrishna Mutt, which does justice. But, it is bette=\r\nr if one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; knows Sanskrit and reads Sanskrit verses directly, because =\r\nthere is some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; special power in the combinations of words used and re=\r\nading them in that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; form has a special impact. If one reads Avadhoota=\r\n Gita, one will realize\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that what I&#39;ve been writing on the goal of s=\r\nadhana is consistent with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Avadhoota Gita says. So is it =\r\nwith what Maharshi Vasishtha says in Yoga\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Vaasishtham!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n While Dattatreya says &quot;I am this body, I am that body and I am all\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nbodies\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and yet I am not a body&quot;, it is unwise to think that Goraksha=\r\nnath (from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dattatreya&#39;s lineage!) would set as ultimate goal making =\r\na specific body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; immortal. This is a gross misrepresentation of Gorak=\r\nshanath and his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; teachings. In fact, anynody who thinks one can under=\r\nstand the essence of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nath&#39;s teaching from a book or a verse=\r\n is fooling oneself. Only those\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; who\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are meant for it can bene=\r\nfit from the guidance of a Nath. Others can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; see the supe=\r\nrficial aspects of the words attributed to a Nath. To say\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Gorakhnath&#39;s path is about achieving &quot;Kayasiddhi&quot; is totally wrong.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Gorakshanath&#39;s path is about liberation while living, which is described\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Avadhoota Gita, Yoga Vaasishtham and several other scriptu=\r\nres, and that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; does\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; NOT mean physical immortality.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; One understanding the true essence of the teachings of Gorakshanath,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Matsyendranath and Dattatreya and following their teachings perfectly\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; may\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; indeed get various siddhis though one may not actively wan=\r\nt them. As\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Vasishtha says in Yoga Vaasishtham, various siddhis in th=\r\ne field of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duality\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are irrelevant to a seeker of liberation a=\r\nnd they can even become\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; hindrances. But, one truly understanding the=\r\n teachings of Naths and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dattatreya will not succumb to them and will=\r\n become like Shiva. My point\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that one who starts off think=\r\ning that physical immoortality of a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; specific\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; physical body (o=\r\nr another siddhi like that) is the goal is going to get\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; stuck at som=\r\ne stage.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Liberation is lack of attraction or aversion to anyt=\r\nhing in the field of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duality - an object or an idea or a notion. Eit=\r\nher rejection of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; everything\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as an illusion or acceptance of e=\r\nverything as divine can make one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; eventually\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; overcome all attr=\r\nactions and aversions. Thinking of immortalizing one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; particular phys=\r\nical body will not help one with that. In fact, a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; realized\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pe=\r\nrson will not think &quot;I am this body&quot;, as the quote above from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dattat=\r\nreya\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shows.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, the verse quoted below says one b=\r\necomes like Shiva in the end.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Did\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Shiva strive for physical i=\r\nmmortality? When Shiva came to earth as Adi\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Shankara, he did not tea=\r\nch physical immortality. Instead, he taught that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; body is mithya (an =\r\nillusion).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As I said, siddhas like Trilinga Swami could manif=\r\nest their physical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bodies\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in two places at the same time. Why=\r\n Trilinga Swami, my guru&#39;s guru (Sri\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nakhate Maharaj) did that. Oned=\r\nay, my guru Manish saw his guru standing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; front of him in p=\r\nhysical body, showing hand in a blessing pose and then\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; waving it as =\r\na good bye sign. Manish later found out that other\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; disciples of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Nakhate maharaj living in various parts of the world saw a similar scene=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the same time and that Maharaj gave up his physical body =\r\nin Pune at that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; time! If one is indeed a siddha (let alone a natha) =\r\nand has some control\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; over matter, it may be possible to menifest and=\r\n unmanifest perishable\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; physical bodies at will. Where does physical =\r\nimmortality stand in that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; context?!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: ht=\r\ntp://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nvedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyotish=\r\nWritings\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Just a thought on the path of Gorakhnath.

But you are going to the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; other extreme when suggesting that physical immortality is the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; highest ideal. Neither viewpoint is correct.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ignoring the views of a stereotypical =\r\npsudo-vedantin of today, we\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can see that vedanta in fact does=\r\n not say physical body is to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ignored. It asks us *realize*=\r\n that we are not the physical body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we are s=\r\nomething else residing in a shell called the physical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What we truly are, can neither be created nor be destroyed,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical body may perish. But, if someone =\r\ncurrently thinks that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a physical body, o=\r\nne cannot simply ignore the physical body.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nhas to *use* the physical body to eventually realize that one is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the physical body. A mere intellectual statement of i=\r\nt is not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tantamount to its realization.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Yoga Vaasishtham, Maharshi Vasi=\r\nshtha clearly says that action\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (karma) and knowledge (jnaana)=\r\n are two wings with which the bird\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individua=\r\nlized consciousness flies into the sky of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-realization.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physical body is not to be ignored, but to be used skillfully =\r\nand\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carefully to perform the *right actions* that can free on=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I said earlier, one performing actions wi=\r\nthout correct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (that god is the doer o=\r\nf all actions!) is like a person who is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; walking around a moun=\r\ntain not realizing that the goal of walking\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nto reach the top. Such a person will keep walking forever and not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; reach the top. On the other hand, one having the correct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n knowledge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not performing actions is like someone who kno=\r\nws that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reaching\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the top of the mountain is the=\r\n goal and keeps staring at the top,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without walking. Such a p=\r\nerson will remain at the base of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mountain. Thus, jnaana a=\r\nnd karma alone are not able to free one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tha=\r\nt is why Vasishtha compares them to two wings of a bird. The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nequilibrium caused by action and knowledge is what takes us\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nowards\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liberation.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physical bodies of some siddhas may indeed remain intac=\r\nt for a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; long\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time, like centuries or millennia.=\r\n But, eventually, they too may\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give up physical body. Someone=\r\n mentioned Vallalar, but he gave up\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical body, didn&#39;t he?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, to a truly liberated siddha, this di=\r\nscussion of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immortality will sound sil=\r\nly. Self is uncreated and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indestructible,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but i=\r\nts modifications such as physical forms can be born and be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; de=\r\nstroyed at will really. A siddha, as long as one does not merge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brahman completely, can remain in an individualized *et=\r\nhereal*\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a subtle ego, even after givi=\r\nng up a physical body. One can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then create a physical body at=\r\n will, then merge back in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ethereal\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body aft=\r\ner a few decades or centuries or millennia and so on. So,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wha=\r\nt is the whole point of physical immortality?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nrilinga Swami (aka Telang Swami) of Kashi was a perfected\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sid=\r\ndha.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was a guru-bhai of Vimalananda. Ramakrishna Paramaham=\r\nsa\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; commented\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; during a visit to Varanasi that Tr=\r\nilinga Swami was Shiva himself.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhairavi Brahmani who came to=\r\n Dakshineshwar and taught Tantra to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna was in the li=\r\nneage of Trilinga Swami. Later, a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grateful\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rama=\r\nkrishna revisited Kashi and fed Trilinga Swami a big\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; containe=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; full of rice pudding with his own hands! During his impriso=\r\nnment\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the British (for walking naked in Kash=\r\ni), he was seen by some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guards\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be in his cel=\r\nl and also walking on the prison compound wall at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same ti=\r\nme. Even when he finally decided to give up his body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his disciples put his body in a container and threw it into\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ganges,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was seen after a few minutes to walk on t=\r\nhe other side.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a realized being with a high =\r\nenough command over duality,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; creation and destruction of phys=\r\nical body is not a big deal.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who thinks tha=\r\nt a gold coin is special and needs to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; preserved\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; forever will struggle to do so. One who realizes that a gold\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; coin, a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gold chain, a gold ring, a golden arrow etc are a=\r\nll basically the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same (gold) can melt the coin and recreate i=\r\nt again. Preserving\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coin forever is an irre=\r\nlevant goal.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThe key point is this. Trilinga Swami did not get those abilities\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; because he wanted them or did a sadhana for them specifically.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The same non-dual Self fills us all. Whether X realize=\r\ns non-dual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Self or Y realizes non-dual Self, the realization =\r\nis the same.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if one retains individual ego=\r\n-consciousness and interacts with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field of =\r\nduality, different possibilities are there. One may\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engage\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in various actions using a physical body and at the end drop th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ego-consciousness and merge in Brahman. Or, one may engage =\r\nin\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; various actions using a physical body, then give it up and=\r\n tie\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ego-consciousness to an ethereal body =\r\nand remain in a higher\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realm\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a long time. I=\r\nf so, one may re-enter a physical body from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; to time. But, all this is governed by one&#39;s caliber and evolution\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the field of duality. Though, all are the same at t=\r\nhe non-dual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; level, different beings have different caliber in=\r\n the field of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; duality. A rishi or Vishnu or a siddha or a nat=\r\nha may not be the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same as somebody else.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like Aurobindo, but I am afraid=\r\n he lent himself vulnerable to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misinterpretation when it come=\r\ns to divinization of matter. I say\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite emphatically that ph=\r\nysical immortality as an ideal and as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; end g=\r\noal of one&#39;s sadhana is a dangerous idea.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The o=\r\nnly worthy goal is to efface individual ego, realize Self\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if needed, engage with the world with a subtle ego and do\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whatever\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes spontaneously. Once heavier condi=\r\ntioning is overcome,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nature\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; starts to show one =\r\nthe role one has to play. One should just play\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the role given=\r\n to one well, instead of asking for this role or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; role.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasi=\r\nmha\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-320641522-1292318895=:61965\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;=\r\nfont-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Ther=\r\ne are some interesting&nbsp;information about the Naths including GorakshaN=\r\nath, and quite a bit of misinformation too.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Fi=\r\nrstly, the 9 Naths are considered to be immortals. They are worshipped most=\r\nly in Maharastra in India. Those who know Marathi can read the NavNath Bhak=\r\ntisar. That text is not a mere book but a powerful scripture, doing parayan=\r\na of which can give serious spiritual benefits. There are some very old boo=\r\nks in Bengali too which speak of the Nath. I am yet to trace those books. B=\r\nut authentic sources tell me so. For example the name of Chowrungee in Calc=\r\nutta is based on the name of Chowrungee Nath.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In Nepal, Goraksha and MatsyendraNath are considered to b=\r\ne household deities. Coming to Maharastra, the Nav Nath Bhaktisar details s=\r\ntories of all the 9 nath, their origin and their lives. Lineages of the Nat=\r\nh are found in plenty and maximum&nbsp;in Maharastra. This is infact consid=\r\nered to be Nath Bhoomi. Krishna decided to come down as Dyaneshwar, and 9 s=\r\npiritual giants came along with him to work.

I =\r\ncannot open yahoo groups. When I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; get a good internet connection, I =\r\nmay try to see vedic-wisdom.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I like to hear and read spirit=\r\nual talks by others, but I really&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dislike describing my experiences=\r\n. The reason is simple : most of the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; persons will not believe and t=\r\nherefore it will serve no worthwhile&lt;BR&gt;&gt; purpose. In your message above=\r\n, I read &quot;I am the body&quot;. This feeling&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is what I endeavoured to ove=\r\nrcome through Tapa for years. Due to my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; efforts of self-purificatio=\r\nn, which included overcoming Deep Sleep and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ensure constant Japa ev=\r\nen throughout night, I was blessed with the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; visits of many deities =\r\nand siddhas and it will be foolish to describe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; these\n experiences t=\r\no everone. I was gaining some siddhis, but I left&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that road due to =\r\nsome unsavoury incidents. The only siddhi, if you can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; call it a sid=\r\ndhi, that I gained through Tapa and Blessings and which I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; want to k=\r\neep is my enhanced capacity to judge things, books, persons&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and eve=\r\nnts. Earlier, I wasted years torn in the horns of the dilemma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of to=\r\n be or not to be a part of the false melodrama known as Samsaara,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; l=\r\ningering in the labyrinths of Doubts of all sorts. I got the correct&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; answer later : To be AND not to be at the same time. To be, but with a&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Saaksheebhaava. To watch not only others, but our own actions and&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; thoughts, dreams, etc, as a mere Onlooker and not as a participant;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; hence Not to be too. Shri Mad-Bhaagavata says : &quot;aashaa hi paramam&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; duHkham, nairaashyam paramam sukham&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One personal ex=\r\nperience I want to share is that the Ego I was\n thinking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; as my real=\r\n Self got detached from me long ago, but I have not got good&lt;BR&gt;&gt; riddan=\r\nce from it : it now abuses me but I do not care for it. I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sometimes=\r\n keep a pretence of Ego to deal with worldly persons, but the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; real =\r\nEgo is a detached powerless entity watched by me. Years ago, once&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I=\r\n felt my existence sinking down at night. I asked my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Upastha/Janane=\r\nndriya to come up; it answered : Brahmaa ji made my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; place at bottom=\r\n, how can I come up?? Then I realized my folly. The&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Praana should c=\r\nome up. Others may laugh at me, but the fact is that I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; could hear m=\r\ny indriyas and could talk to them as if they were separate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; beings!!=\r\n I gradually realized that they accompany me from time&lt;BR&gt;&gt; immemorial, =\r\nbut I do not really belong to them, or to this ephemeral&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Body.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; This is the real Siddhi we should all strive for : Seal-realization.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Japa, tapa, homam, dhyaana, etc\n are all means. The end is Constant&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Self-Awareness, awareness of the real Self which is omnipresent,&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; omniscient, disinrested and detached, yet one with everone. Veda does&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; not differentiate between individual soul and God. Last verse of Wh=\r\nite&lt;BR&gt;&gt; YV : &quot;yo asau Aaditya purushaH so asau aham&quot;. This normal state=\r\n of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Atman is sama-aadhi, opposed to egoistical state which is Vyaad=\r\nhi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Both states can be easily attained and retained, provided const=\r\nant&lt;BR&gt;&gt; practice is made. Vyaadhi or Vyutthaana is easier due to past h=\r\nabits&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of mind and indriyas. That is why Tapa is required for Samaad=\r\nhi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Samaadhi needs statue-like fixation of the body as well as of t=\r\nhe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind, which can be attained only through Tapa for normal humans.=\r\n But&lt;BR&gt;&gt; most of the mortals in Kaliyuga want shortcuts to evade Tapa. =\r\nThey do&lt;BR&gt;&gt; not know that real Dhyaana is a painful Tapa till it become=\r\ns a normal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; habit of the\n purified mind, after which dhyaana opens t=\r\nhe road to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bliss. No worldly pleasue can be compared to the siritua=\r\nl bliss when&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Soul is Itself and Only Itself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -vj&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; On 12/12/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr%40charter.ne=\r\nt&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:pvr%40charter.net&quot;&gt;pvr@=\r\ncharter.net&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; I am forwarding the reply from Sri Vinay Jha, a monk in north India=\r\n. Though&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; he cc&#39;ed his reply to vedic-wisdom, it was not delive=\r\nred because he is not a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; member. So I am forwarding it (see bel=\r\now).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To members: In my limited interactions with =\r\nhim over the last few months, I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; have seen that he is a man wit=\r\nh good understanding and clear thinking. I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; usually do not have=\r\n any significant disagreement with him in spiritual&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; matters. A=\r\nny difference between what we say\n is often because we may be using&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; different words or looking at things from different angles, but not b=\r\necause&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of fundamental differences.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; V=\r\ninay ji summarized it beautifully:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Body is pr=\r\nimarily a means to fulfil desires. Those who have conquered&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; desires are in no need of body. But then they get siddhis!! What an&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; irony ! Those who run after siddhis do not get anything.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; ... Striving after siddhis is the greatest folly. Siddhis are&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; actually distractions which test the power of a yogi to conc=\r\nenrrate.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; All kinds of siddhi are possible. They s=\r\nhould neither be avoided nor&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; pursued. Take what comes your way=\r\n, but do not desire anything. There should&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; be NOTHING that you=\r\n hold as &quot;I wish I had this&quot; or &quot;I wish I did NOT have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; this&quot;, =\r\nfor any attraction or\n aversion will block you! As Vinay ji rightly&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; says, the irony is that one running after siddhis is often deprived o=\r\nf any,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; while one without desires may be tempted with this sidd=\r\nhi or that siddhi so&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that desire may be reborn! Only after one=\r\n passes all tests and attraction&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and aversion are not born in =\r\nany circumstances is one truly free. The above&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; paragraph is a =\r\ngood summary of this discussion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Vinay ji is wise in not wanting to talk about personal expe=\r\nriences. I share&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a few of them as they are useful in highlight=\r\ning some notions and some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; lessons and in inspiring and caution=\r\ning sadhakas. I am quoting a portion&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; from &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481:&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481:&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n ------------ Begin Quote ------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I was =\r\nsleeping oneday. In the middle of the night, I woke up. When I was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; still on the bed and partially awake, my shakti rose. In other words, =\r\nmy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; self-awareness got refined. I first perceived a tremendous =\r\nbolt of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; electricity going up in my back. Then, in a split seco=\r\nnd, my perception of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that electricity changed from &quot;shakti ins=\r\nide me&quot; to &quot;I inside shakti&quot;. My&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; changed perception was that t=\r\nhere was a tremendous amount of shakti that was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; surging up lik=\r\ne an ocean wave and encompassing everything that was there and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n that I was a very tiny particle in that tremendous wave. Moreover, I also&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;heard&quot; a specific beejaakshara being chanted together by mill=\r\nions of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; people, who were all tiny particles in that wave. That=\r\n wave reverberated&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with the sound of that beejaakshara and I p=\r\nerceived\n that I too was chanting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that beejaakshara along with=\r\n all. My mind was filled with that sound and a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; kind of bliss. =\r\nMy self-awareness was that of a tiny particle filled with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that=\r\n sound and joy and nothing else. I was unaware of anything else.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Compared to my normal mental state, it was a very simple and yet fantast=\r\nic&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; state to be in. I was in that state for a while. Suddenly a=\r\n thought that can&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; be loosely expressed as &quot;Amn&#39;t I on the bed =\r\nin a room? How am I hearing this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; loud sound? Are there people =\r\nin the room&quot; came to my mind. That thought&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; disturbed the state=\r\n of my mind and my shakti came down. In other words, I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; returne=\r\nd to the regular level of self-awareness and again perceived that I&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; was a body lying on a bed in a room. The bliss was gone and mind was =\r\nagain&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; filled with hundreds of thoughts as usual.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I mentioned this incident a few days later to Manish. When th=\r\nis happened, it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was the middle of the night for me and morning=\r\n for Manish. When I mentioned&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the incident and said that I hea=\r\nrd the sound of a beejaakshara reverberating&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in the wave in wh=\r\nich I was a small particle, Manish immediately said he knew&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it=\r\n and also mentioned the specific beejaakshara and asked &quot;that is what you&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; heard, right?&quot; That was indeed correct. Moreover, I had never m=\r\neditated with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that beejaakshara before and it is not something=\r\n one would expect me to have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; a mystical experience with.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When I confirmed that was the beejaakshara I heard, Ma=\r\nnish shed some light:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;I was at that time meditating with that=\r\n beejaakshara. So and so deity came&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and filled my consciousnes=\r\ns. I then went into a nice samadhi. Some people&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n close to me m=\r\nay also have experienced that deity at that time. But we should&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; realize that this is all Her play and we are just nimittas. What she does=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and why she does, she knows and we do not. We are just dummie=\r\ns observing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; what comes our way. We neither make anything happe=\r\nn nor should we desire&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; anything to happen. Just be and observe=\r\n. Do not be attracted or repelled by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; anything.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -=\r\n------------ End Quote -------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Making someo=\r\nne who is thousands of miles away (especially one who is leading&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; a normal mundane life and has many bad samskaras!) have a specific subli=\r\nme&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; experience is not an ordinary feat.

There is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; another world f=\r\nor them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I know siddha of Nath sampradaya now living in th=\r\ne Shiva Temple near&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a creamation ground in Jammu. He can c=\r\nreate matter out of nothing, and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; talk from great distances=\r\n telepathically. I know some siddhas of other&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sampradaayas=\r\n too. None of them wants physical immortality, but it is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a=\r\nttainable. Even BPHS talks of Amitaayu.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Appearing\n simulta=\r\nneously at many places is not physical replication.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Brahma=\r\n-sutra talks about Nirmaana-kaayaa. Sooksma Deha can be created&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; by siddhas at will and for lesser mortals these dehas are no less rea=\r\nl&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; than physical body. To remove my skepticism, my late Gur=\r\nu ji had shown&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; me many exaples of controllong matter from =\r\n50 kilometres away. I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; personally know many living Antaryaa=\r\nmis who are perfect clairvoyants&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and more. To mortals addi=\r\ncted to senses, physical body or physical&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; world is everyth=\r\ning, but those who soar above regard the physical as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; maaya=\r\na because it can be ceeated by Kalpanaa of a siddha. The whole&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Creation is a Kalpa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Body is primarily a means to ful=\r\nfil desires. Those who have conquered&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; desires are in no ne=\r\ned of body. But then they get siddhis!! What an&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt; irony ! T=\r\nhose who run after siddhis do not get anything.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have som=\r\ne experience of these things, but I do not like to talk&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ab=\r\nout personal experiences. It is wrong to say that Jnaana or Kriya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; yogacannot bring siddhis. All types of real Yoga can bring siddhis.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But as the saying goes, those who strive to become saints=\r\n become&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; satans. Striving after siddhis is the greatest fol=\r\nly. Siddhis are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; actually distractions which test the power=\r\n of a yogi to concenrrate.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -vj&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; On 12/11/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailt=\r\no:pvr%40charter.net&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:pvr%4=\r\n0charter.net&quot;&gt;pvr@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Please do not get carried away=\r\n with this verse. Naths are also known as&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt; &gt; Mahasiddha=\r\ns. These are not ordinary beings. Nath means Lord or master.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Depending on how you count them, there are either 64 or 9 of them,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; incarnated from various transcendental qualities of t=\r\nhe Lord. These are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; adept beings with perfect mastery =\r\nover various aspects of the field of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duality. They ar=\r\ne ever-liberated and yet are born again and again to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nshow&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the path of liberation to people.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Lord Dattatreya is the original guru of all N=\r\naths. Please read his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Avadhoota Gita&quot;. There is a ni=\r\nce English translation by Swami&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Asokananda (I&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; think) of Ramakrishna Mutt, which does justice. But, it is b=\r\netter if one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; knows Sanskrit and reads Sanskrit verses=\r\n directly, because there is some&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt; &gt; special power in th=\r\ne combinations of words used and reading them in that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n form has a special impact. If one reads Avadhoota Gita, one will realize&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that what I&#39;ve been writing on the goal of sadhana is =\r\nconsistent with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Avadhoota =\r\nGita says. So is it with what Maharshi Vasishtha says in Yoga&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Vaasishtham!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; While Dat=\r\ntatreya says &quot;I am this body, I am that body and I am all&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; bodies&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and yet I am not a body&quot;, it is unwise to=\r\n think that Gorakshanath (from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dattatreya&#39;s lineage!)=\r\n would set as ultimate goal making a specific body&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; im=\r\nmortal. This is a gross misrepresentation of Gorakshanath and his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; &gt; teachings. In fact, anynody who thinks one can understand the =\r\nessence of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nath&#39;s teaching f=\r\nrom a book or a verse is fooling oneself. Only those&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nwho&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are meant for it can benefit from the guidance of=\r\n a Nath. Ot\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
