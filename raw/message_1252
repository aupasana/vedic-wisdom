Homam is far more efficient \nthan other sadhanas and actually increases the effectiveness of other \nsadhanas when used in conjunction with them. However, time has to come for \nanything. Don&#39;t worry about the inability to do homam.\n\nMeditation of 15-20 min is only better than no meditation. It is not really \nthat effective. For most people, it is hardly sufficient for cleaning up the \nimpurities that accumulated in the subtle body within the last 24 hours. One \nneeds to take care of accumulated karmas of several lives and that needs \nmuch heavier sadhana.\n\nHowever, if this is all you can manage now, that is fine. As I keep saying, \nrituals like japam and homam are only one part of the sadhana one does. One \ncan engage in constant contemplation of one&#39;s thoughts and motives to weed \nout the internal weaknesses and overcome ego. Every moment and every \nactivity can and should be sadhana. Watch your thoughts and reactions to \nwhat others do and say and see if any shadripus (internal enemies) or other \ninternal weaknesses have a role in those thoughts and how ego is causing all \nthis. When one starts to put in conscious effort into such contemplation, \nthat is also sadhana. Whether one does japam or homam or something else, \nthis contemplation is also needed. If you cannot do those, you can still \nengage in contemplation. Depending on your readiness, it can work fast or \nslowly. But remember that no effort is ever wasted.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, February 21, 2009 3:48 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Homa & Meditation !!!\n\n\n&gt; Namaste sir\n&gt; that was a very good description\n&gt; but at present i hv not been in a position to do homam\n&gt; i hv been doing meditation for a very small 15- 20 minutes twice a\n&gt; day but\n&gt; of late i hv styarted falling asleep during that period\n&gt; how can i avoid it\n&gt; becoz somewhere i read that at time it increases tamas\n&gt; how can i avoid it\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt; jitender\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot;\n&gt; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Maharshi Parasara, father of Maharshi Vyasa, wrote a treatise on\n&gt; Jyotisha\n&gt;&gt; shastra just before Kali yuga started. He referred in it a few\n&gt; times to the\n&gt;&gt; &quot;intellectual pygmies of Kali yuga&quot; and gave techniques suitable\n&gt; for\n&gt;&gt; astrologers of Kali yuga. Thus, he was conscious of impending Kali\n&gt; yuga and\n&gt;&gt; that was on his in mind as he taught. In the chapters on remedial\n&gt; measures\n&gt;&gt; to overcome karmic problems (as represented by planets and\n&gt; horoscope), he\n&gt;&gt; basically referred to various kinds of homas. Though some people\n&gt; may insist\n&gt;&gt; on japam (meditation) today, Parasara only referred to offering\n&gt; mantras in\n&gt;&gt; homam fire. He was not specific on poorvaangam (initial offerings)\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; uttaraangam (final offerings) to be used and asked to use whatever\n&gt;&gt; agnimukham (fire ritual procedure) is practiced in the family or\n&gt; by one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; gurus. But he was specific on the mantras to be offered in fire\n&gt; for various\n&gt;&gt; deities.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Obviously, Parasara did not advise japam (meditation) of various\n&gt; mantras and\n&gt;&gt; instead advised homam (fire ritual) with various mantras, for a\n&gt; reason. He\n&gt;&gt; knew that the latter is *far more effective* in Kali yuga.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The goal of sadhana is to burn impurities in the subtle body\n&gt; (synonymous to\n&gt;&gt; overcoming various internal enemies and weaknesses) so that energy\n&gt; can flow\n&gt;&gt; freely within one&#39;s subtle body. The internal fire (bhootaagni)\n&gt; burning\n&gt;&gt; within us does this burning. When you focus your mind on a mantra,\n&gt;&gt; bhootaagni burns and starts acting.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However, the ability of *most* people to focus the mind is highly\n&gt; limited.\n&gt;&gt; The bhootaagni is extremely low in most people. Thus, meditation\n&gt; of mantras\n&gt;&gt; even in counts of millions does not make much difference really.\n&gt; There is an\n&gt;&gt; impact only if one spends 4-5 hours meditating on the mantra\n&gt; everyday. The\n&gt;&gt; first hour or so is warm up, mind slowly achieves a decent focus\n&gt; after that\n&gt;&gt; and the fire starts to burn slowly.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you do the same meditation in front of an external fire, it\n&gt; makes a big\n&gt;&gt; difference. You tend to absorb some qualities from the people you\n&gt; spend time\n&gt;&gt; with. When you spend a lot of time with a cinema fan, the cinema\n&gt; fan inside\n&gt;&gt; you becomes strong. When you spend a lot of time with a politics\n&gt; observer,\n&gt;&gt; the politics observer inside you becomes strong. Similarly, when\n&gt; you spend a\n&gt;&gt; lot of time with fire, the fire inside you becomes strong.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you do a 30-min homam and spend just 10 minutes meditating by\n&gt; the fire\n&gt;&gt; after homam, the energy surrounding you, the level of focus you\n&gt; can get and\n&gt;&gt; the amount of impurities you can burn are much more than a regular\n&gt;&gt; meditation for a couple of hours!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One need not believe me. The proof of the pudding is in eating it.\n&gt; If\n&gt;&gt; anybody tries to do a 30-minute homam everyday (or atleast every\n&gt; weekend)\n&gt;&gt; for a few months, one should find some difference internally.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mahaganapathi homam is very apt for many people. Lord Ganapathi\n&gt; takes care\n&gt;&gt; of one&#39;s material needs and gives spiritual progress at the same\n&gt; time. A\n&gt;&gt; detailed manual, an audio MP3 file and a complete youtube video of\n&gt; a simple\n&gt;&gt; 20-min Mahaganapathi homam are available for free, so that people\n&gt; can learn\n&gt;&gt; and get started (see the link below).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is not without a reason that many sadhus (saints) maintain a\n&gt; dhuni\n&gt;&gt; (constant fire) near them. When at Dakshineshwar, Swami\n&gt; Vivekananda used to\n&gt;&gt; light a big fire in open space that would burn throughout the\n&gt; night and he\n&gt;&gt; used to meditate by it whole night.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If one can actually spend a couple of hours meditating by the side\n&gt; of a\n&gt;&gt; bright fire everyday, I am sure they can make a lot of quick\n&gt; progress.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 19, 2009 11:52 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Homa & Meditation !!!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Garu!\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I read somewhere that you are of the opinion that 20/30 minutes\n&gt; Homa\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is equivalent to 4/5 hours of Meditation. I didn&#39;t understand it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; some 3 or 4 days back, i suddenly realise, while in the midst of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; homa activities that i&#39;ve always forgotten about the surroundings\n&gt;&gt; &gt; whenever i sit for homa. (from preparation to conclusion). this i\n&gt;&gt; &gt; realised suddenly. for example - After taking bath, i empty all\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ashes of previous day in a bag, wash & clean homa-kund with\n&gt; liquid\n&gt;&gt; &gt; detergent, wash other utensils, and other such required\n&gt; preparation,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; start the actual procedure and conclude. during all theses\n&gt;&gt; &gt; activities, the surroundings are almost forgotten (i also make\n&gt; sure\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that i switch on the silent mode in cell phone).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; no w i am getting some glimpses of what you meant but still wish\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; understand more on that from you. take your time as i know that\n&gt; you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; have your hands-full.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; warm regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Utpal\n\n\n"}}
