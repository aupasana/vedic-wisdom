But then, we perhaps don&#39;t understand them well either..\n- My wakefulness and my sleep are like day and night, one following the other. But both are aspects of me. Similarly, Vishnu&#39;s wakefulness and Yoganidra are both aspects of Vishnu and follow each other.\n- But Vishnu himself has some control over his own Yoganidra when awake (like we do). Like great yogis do, he also has the ability to break out of his own deep Yoganidra. But he respects the cosmic laws and subjects himself to being controlled by Yoganidra when it is deep (unless there is a compelling reason in a specific case).\n- But don&#39;t look at Vishnu&#39;s Yoganidra as a different person from Vishnu - it is a part of Vishnu.\n- Suppose infinite consciousness limits itself to a limited manifestation such as a human being. The shakti that makes that being feel, want, think, know and do (including: feel hungry, feel satiated, sleep, wake up etc), is a limited aspect of cosmic shakti. A yogi may indeed develop some control over that limited shakti.\n- However, please note that EVEN the act of controlling shakti that makes one do, know, want, feel various things, is eventually done by an aspect of cosmic shakti manifesting through one! In the end, any movement in consciousness is through cosmic shakti only!\n- Thus, one able to control shakti and control one&#39;s normal actions, feeling, wants etc is effectively *downloading* higher cosmic shakti that &quot;controls&quot; lower levels of shakti that were previously opearating through one!\n- If one foolishly thinks &quot;I control my shakti&quot;, that thought and pride are also works of shakti only.\n- All movements in consciousness are the work of cosmic shakti. Thus, any control of any entity is basically the work of shakti. But it does not prevent one from identifying with shakti doing a specific work through one and thinking &quot;I am doing it&quot;.\n- One can really not &quot;control&quot; shakti in absolute terms (i.e. always some level of shakti works through one and controls *other* levels of shakti). The only way one can &quot;control&quot; shakti is indirect, i.e. by not being controlled by shakti. That is only possible if one has no wants and just observes the play with no agenda whatsoever. Once one has agendas and takes part in the play, one is under the control of shakti.\n- Shiva is that observer with no agendas and with perfect detachment. So saying that Shiva has perfect control over shakti is valid, though most people are likely to misunderstand what &quot;control&quot; entitles here.\n\nOk, I hope these disjoint ramblings make some sense to someone.. :-)\n\nSeriously though, ramblings may indeed make perfect sense to someone. Sometimes, nonsense written by an idiot can give become a wise person&#39;s breakthrough in thinking process! Similarly, mantra chanted by a distracted seeker may do nothing for the chanter, but a listener may reap tremendous benefits from listening with rapt attention and focus! She enacts the play using various players, each wanting various things..\n\nBTW, I just watched a nice documentary film titled &quot;Awake: The life of Yogananda&quot;, on the life of Paramahamsa Yogananda.

Firstly the idea of control or the sense of control is a human terminology that does not work in things beyond human. We says a father controls his son, a boss controls his employee etc. And it implies always a stress inherent in the process. Which is natural because life here on this plane is born out of stress and friction and at every step has to work itself through various opposing forces. Therefore we need to use terms like &#39;control&#39; to make sense of what is happening.\n\nBut Cosmic Beings and Cosmic Forces like Lord Vishnu or Goddess Mahamaya are not human at all. They were there before the first human appeared on earth and they will still exist if by some weird accident the whole human species is wiped off the face of thiis planet. But since we humans are actually extremely puny in a real cosmic sense, so the effective way to build any relationship with these Beings and Forces is to try and personify and humanize them. That works fine upto  a point but also creates these kind of complex questions in our minds, which may not have any real basis.\n\nMy point is wondering whether Vishnu controls Yogamaya nor Yogamaya controls Vishnu is like asking whether day controls night or night controls day. Nothing controls anything in the human sense, they just exist complimenting each other in a superb balance and harmony without the slightest stress involved in the whole process. Stress is for us humans, often in a subliminal sense. Being stress-free even in complex external acvities is at the heart of spirituality, why?, because then we have learnt to successfully emulate these Cosmic Beings and Forces who have no conception of human stress. That is all the sadhana is about anyway.\n\nHope I have made sense.\n\n-Regards\n Rajarshi\n \n\nI have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all. -Sri Aurobindo\n\nFrom: &quot;vsra_prasad@...

But I thought the example may not be correct.\nFor me, it is both ways. There are times I control my sleep and there are times when I am extremely tired, sleep controls me. But looking at other way, I am on the bed to sleep, but sleep catches up slowly at a time I do not determine. Which is why I wanted to know, if Lord Vishnu and his yoganidra work similarly and I doubt if they do.\n\nrAma\n\nFrom: Narasimha P.V.R.

Firstly the idea of control or the sense of control is a human terminology that does not work in things beyond human. We says a father controls his son, a boss controls his employee etc. And it implies always a stress inherent in the process. Which is natural because life here on this plane is born out of stress and friction and at every step has to work itself through various opposing forces. Therefore we need to use terms like &#39;control&#39; to make sense of what is happening.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;But Cosmic Beings and Cosmic Forces like Lord Vishnu or Goddess Mahamaya are not human at all. They were there before the first human appeared on earth and they will still exist if by some weird accident the whole human species is wiped off the face of thiis planet. But since we humans are actually extremely puny in a real cosmic sense, so the effective way to build any relationship with these\n Beings and Forces is to try and personify and humanize them. That works fine upto &nbsp;a point but also creates these kind of complex questions in our minds, which may not have any real basis.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;My point is wondering whether Vishnu controls Yogamaya nor Yogamaya controls Vishnu is like asking whether day controls night or night controls day. Nothing controls anything in the human sense, they just exist complimenting each other in a superb balance and harmony without the slightest stress involved in the whole process. Stress is for us humans, often in a subliminal sense. Being stress-free even in complex external acvities is at the heart of spirituality, why?, because then we have learnt to successfully emulate these Cosmic Beings and Forces who have no conception of human stress. That is all the sadhana is about anyway.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;&quot;\n style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;Hope I have made sense.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all. -Sri Aurobindo&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;br class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;&quot; style=&quot;&quot;&gt;From: &quot;vsra_prasad@...

There are times I control my sleep and there are times when I am extremely tired, sleep controls me. But looking at other way, I am on the bed to sleep, but sleep catches up slowly at a time I do not determine.
