It mainly t=\r\nalks \nabout Thakur&#39;s Reincarnation in North-west direction and about 100 \ny=\r\nears.\n\nhttp://www.vedantauk.com/magazine_articles_Sept06.htm#If%\n20Ramakris=\r\nhna%20Were%20Alive%20Today%20(continued)%20Swami%\n20Chetanananda\n\nFollowing=\r\n are the excerpts from the Same Article.\n\nBest Regards\n\nUtpal\n\n!....!.....!=\r\n\nOn 26 November 1935, Swami Vijnanananda said to the devotees in \nBarisal (=\r\nwhich is now in Bangladesh): &quot;This time the Master came \nsecretly. He will =\r\ncome again after one hundred years in the \nnorthwest direction.&quot;\nA Devotee:=\r\n &quot;Did the Master say that he would be born in the Punjab?&quot;\nVijnanananda: &quot;N=\r\no, the Master did not say that he would be born in \nthe Punjab.&quot; \nSwami Abh=\r\nedananda recalled: &quot;One evening Sri Ramakrishna was \nattended by his faithf=\r\nul attendants Shashi [Ramakrishnananda] and \nKali [Abhedananda], who were w=\r\naiting upon him at Cossipore. The \nMaster inspired them by saying: &#39;My Divi=\r\nne Mother has shown me that \nthe photograph of this body will be kept upon =\r\naltars and be \nworshipped in different houses as the pictures of other avat=\r\nars are \nworshipped. My Divine Mother has also shown me that I shall have t=\r\no \ncome back again and that my next incarnation will be in the West.&#39;&quot; \n\n!.=\r\n...!....!\nOn different occasions the Holy Mother made various statements ab=\r\nout \nthe Master&#39;s return. Once she recalled: &quot;The Master said he would \ncom=\r\ne again after a hundred years. Meanwhile, for those hundred years \nhe would=\r\n live in the hearts of those who love him. Standing on the \nsemicircular ve=\r\nranda of Dakshineswar, the Master said this, pointing \ntowards the northwes=\r\nt. I told him I could not come again. Lakshmi \nalso said she would not come=\r\n again, even if she were chopped into \nshreds like tobacco leaves! The Mast=\r\ner laughed and said: &#39;How can \nyou avoid coming? Our roots are twined toget=\r\nher like the kalmi \nplant. Pull one stem and the whole clump comes forward.=\r\n&#39;&quot;  \nThe Holy Mother also stated: &quot;The Master said that he would dwell in \n=\r\nthe hearts of his devotees for a hundred years in his subtle body. \nHe furt=\r\nher said that he would have many devotees among the white \npeople.&quot; \nSwami =\r\nSaradananda wrote on this subject in Sri Ramakrishna and His \nDivine Play: =\r\n&quot;The Master not only knew this about himself through \nhis yogic insight, bu=\r\nt he also told us many times, pointing to the \nnorthwest, that the next tim=\r\ne he would reincarnate there. Some of us \n(Girish Chandra Ghosh and others)=\r\n said that the Master even told \nthem the time of his advent, stating: &#39;I s=\r\nhall have to be born in \nthat direction after two hundred years. Then many =\r\nwill be liberated, \nand those who fail at that time will have to wait a lon=\r\ng time for \nliberation.&#39;&quot; \n!....!....!\nRamakrishna&#39;s niece Lakshmi said: &quot;T=\r\nhe Master said, &#39;I shall come \nback after 100 years.&#39; I can&#39;t definitely sa=\r\ny whether that year \nshould be counted from his birth, or death, or on the =\r\nday when he \nsaid it.&quot; \n!....!....!\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; I vaguely recall read=\r\ning somewhere that Shri Ramakrishna \nParamahamsa once stated that he \n&gt; wou=\r\nld be reborn in 100 or 150 years time, can anyone kindly verify \nwhether th=\r\nat statement \n&gt; is indeed true; and if so kindly provide a reference to the=\r\n text \nthat has that quote? I also \n&gt; recall reading that he mentioned that=\r\n his disciples would again \ngather with him this time \n&gt; around as well; so=\r\n any references to that would be appreciated as \nwell.\n&gt; Best.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
