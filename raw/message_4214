I understand your point abo=\r\nut the Devi taking\nvarious forms in the Chandi Paath where initially the De=\r\nvi manifests\nfrom the assimilation of the energies of the Devas (which are =\r\nreally her\nenergies to begin with just that they are divided into various g=\r\nods and\ndemi gods and the whole manifested universe and its constituents) a=\r\nnd\nthen she displays multiple manifestations of herself through different\nf=\r\norms and attributes to fight various demons and then in the 10th\nchapter sh=\r\ne again assimilates all her attributes and forms into herself\nagain and so =\r\ncompletes the cycle.\n\n\nThe chandi paath is split into three parts where in =\r\nthe last part the\nDevi is manifesting as Maha Saraswati or the pure sattwa =\r\nform of\nmanifested consciousness and she is up against Shumbha and Nishumbh=\r\na who\nas per some commentators are nothing but our Ego or the sense of I\n(S=\r\nhumbha) and Attachment or the sense of mine (Nishumba).  So the\nquestion is=\r\n why would the Devi send Shiva as an envoy to Shumbha and\nNishumba at the e=\r\nnd of the Chandi Paath?  No envoys were sent to Madhu\nKaitabh or the Mahish=\r\nasura or all the other lot of demons througout the\nChandi Paath.  But in th=\r\ne end only when Ego and the sense of Attachment\nremains and all the other d=\r\nemons (impurities) are destroyed then perhaps\nthe pure Sattwic Manifested f=\r\norm of Devi is trying to lead Ego and\nAttachment from self identification t=\r\no identification with Shiva or the\nabsolute consciousness but that is diffi=\r\ncult for Ego and Attachment to\nacomplish and they must be slain as they wil=\r\nl simply not just back down\nand go to the netherworlds.\n\nMaybe I am trying =\r\nto read too much into the text and looking for some\nspecific explanation wh=\r\nen rather the explanation is rather simple as you\npoint out.\n\nRegards\n\nSume=\r\net\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nwr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; I can tell you how I look at it.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; 1) Chand=\r\nika is not just devi, but the sum total of all energies in all\nuniverses. A=\r\ns such she is formless in Her essence. She is the Shaktih of\nBrahman and un=\r\ndifferentiated from Brahman itself. When She asks Lord\nShiva to go to as an=\r\n emissary, it is the One universal power - the\nessence behind all essences =\r\n- who is sending a self-realized cosmic\ndeity (Shiva) as a &quot;doot&quot;. It is as=\r\n if Brahman itself=C2 is sending\nShiva as a &quot;doot&quot;. All deities are finally=\r\n extention and creation out of\nthe great undifferentiated.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; 2) In th=\r\ne 10th chapter we see that Chandi shows Shumbha how all the\nmatrikaas are n=\r\nothing but Her extension. Similarly in the 7th chapter we\nsee, how Kali eme=\r\nrges out of Her eyebrows.=C2  Once Kali destroys\nChanda and Munda, she brin=\r\ngs over the slains head to Chandika who then\nnames Kali as Chamunda.\n&gt; =C2\n=\r\n&gt; In essence, Chandi is everything, all the forms are Her. But again,\neach =\r\nform has slight difference in the way it manifests and functions.\nThere is =\r\nno conflict here.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; At home your children may call you father, at you=\r\nr office your boss\nmay call you by your name,=C2 your parents may call you =\r\nson. But is the\nactual person changing? No. But, your attributes based on y=\r\nour\nfunctionality is changing. The role of a father/son/husband/employee\nre=\r\nquire different jobs to be performed. Similarly each is an aspect of\nthe sa=\r\nme essence which is Chandika. Therefore we have different roopas\nof Her.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; I hope I could put across my view point coherently.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =\r\n=C2 Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me.\n&gt; Take away the m=\r\ne, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Tue, 20/4/10, SumeetK vedichoros=\r\ncope@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: SumeetK vedichoroscope@...\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Shivduti and Chamunda\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tues=\r\nday, 20 April, 2010, 9:07 AM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) In the 8th ch=\r\napter of the Chandi Path, the Shivduti form of the\nDevi\n&gt; is explained. At =\r\na very simple level pure sattwa form of manifested\n&gt; consciousness (Devi) a=\r\nsks the unmanifest / absolute consciousness\n&gt; (Shiva) to go to self identif=\r\nication represented by ego and attachment\n&gt; (Shumbha and Nishumbha) as an e=\r\nnvoy with a proposal for them to\nwithdraw\n&gt; to avoid conflict or if they in=\r\nsist then come to battle and face\ndefeat.\n&gt; What is the esoteric significan=\r\nt of this form of the Devi and why is\nshe\n&gt; doing so?\n&gt;\n&gt; 2) In the 7th cha=\r\npter both Devi and Kali are mentioned in fighting\n&gt; Chanda and Munda and wh=\r\nile the duo are slain by the Devi (Ambika),\ntheir\n&gt; heads are picked up by =\r\nKali and brought over to Devi and henceforth\nKali\n&gt; is said to be called by=\r\n the name of Chamunda. Is a distinction to be\n&gt; made between Devi and Kali =\r\nhere? If so, then why is Kali named as\n&gt; Chamunda when she picks up the sla=\r\nin heads of Chanda and Munda only\n&gt; whereas they are actually slain by the =\r\nDevi.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sumeet\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
