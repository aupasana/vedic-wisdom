One is, taking it literally\n=\r\nthat our current situation is because of our past life karma and whatever\nw=\r\ne are doing currently is either adding up(by bad karma) that karma or\ndimin=\r\nishing it (by good karma). Second interpretation is, the intellectual\nclass=\r\n supporting theory of karma because they thing that this sense of\nbeing pun=\r\nished for wrong doings creates fear in common people to refrain\nfrom wrong =\r\ndoings.\n\nNow while the first one belongs to hard core belief that one will =\r\nbe\npunished in either this life or the other for the wrong doings. The seco=\r\nnd\nperspective is fallible. People may fall prey to maya and actually commi=\r\nt\nwrong doings.\n\nTherefore it is important to illustrate the theory of Karm=\r\na. Shani-dev is\nkaarak of karma, is the reason for your birth in this life.=\r\n The placement\nof Saturn in your birth chart indicates area of life that ne=\r\neds to be\nworked upon and the ones that will be punished in your life. The =\r\nwhole\nsystem of astrology is based on theory of Karma. And yes, you can see=\r\n it\nworking through vedic astrology.\n\nThere are divisional charts D-60 in a=\r\nstrology that indicate past life karma\nof yours, your mother(D-40), your fa=\r\nther (D-45). There are cases when\nperson was found to have phobia related t=\r\no certain things like height or\nwater or pointed weapons. and using these c=\r\nharts, one can identify the\n(death, death-like experiences) reasons for suc=\r\nh phobia.\n\nNow those who are wretched and remain so throughout their life w=\r\nere\nactually destined for this. You would see many examples, where a person=\r\n\nborn in poor family rises up to become very rich whereas other siblings\nbe=\r\ncome nothing. And if you give them money to start business then also they\nw=\r\nill throw it in bad addictions and live in that wretched state always.\n\nYou=\r\n will ask, so is everything destined and there is no free will ? Answer\nis =\r\nyes. It is programmed, destined and illusion of somebody having\nfree-will i=\r\ns also destined.\n\nMantras, Havans, Japas are external activities. These ext=\r\nernal activities\nshould ignite internal Agni within you so that you can ove=\r\nrcome the\nsituation. Agni is meant to purify and transform. It will reduce =\r\nthe Tamas\nand increase Sattwa within you. And if, these external activities=\r\n does not\nignite that internal Agni within you then even if you burn whole =\r\nworld&#39;s\ngrains in Homam, it will not give results.\n\nRegards\nDurgesh O Mishr=\r\na\n\n\n\nOn 16 April 2014 09:55, &lt;dwai79@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear learned =\r\nmembers,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been a silent member of this group for a while now, a=\r\nnd by reading\n&gt; the various conversations in this group, I have derived imm=\r\nense joy of\n&gt; contemplation.
