I will share my th=\r\noughts.\n \nThe goodness of milk is not just a religious belief. It is a fact=\r\n you can verify for yourself.\n \nPhysically speaking, milk is a great source=\r\n of protein that is easy to digest. A diet comprising only of fruits and mi=\r\nlk gives all the nutrition needed by one and keeps one very calm and relaxe=\r\nd. Normal food \n \nFruits and milk are a very saattwik food. The plant givin=\r\ng fruits may feel some pain because of wind and other weather factors. Even=\r\n when the fruit is cut off, the planet may feel pain. Still, the emotions o=\r\nf a plant are far more subtle than those of a human being. The gunas that g=\r\net into the fruits from the plant are far subtler than the gunas that get i=\r\nnto food cooked by a human being. The emotions of a cow are denser than a p=\r\nlant&#39;s, but subtler than a human being&#39;s.\n \nMilk given by a humanely treate=\r\nd cow is definitely superior, but even otherwise milk is superior to a lot =\r\nof substances.\n \nPain and suffering from inhumane treatment is one thing an=\r\nd what they feed is another. A being with a subtle mind can tolerate pain m=\r\nore than others and the mind reacts to pain differently. But the food goes =\r\nthe core of one&#39;s being. We are what we eat. Wrong food affects the mind of=\r\n a being and changes the nature of the mind itself. The milk given by a nor=\r\nmal cow embodies its motherly love and compassion and fills the drinker wit=\r\nh such qualities. But milk given by a cow treated with hormones is differen=\r\nt. These days they feed cows with hormones, chicken and other meat also. Al=\r\nl these slowly change the basic nature of cow&#39;s mind. If milk from cows not=\r\n treated with hormones and not fed chicken is used, that will be a lot bett=\r\ner.\n \nIf you have a chance to pay more and buy milk from a local farm where=\r\n cows are not treated with hormones and chicken and treated humanely, it is=\r\n a good idea to use that milk in religious activities as well as own use.\n =\r\n\nIf a temple can afford it, keeping some cows and getting milk from them is=\r\n a good idea. This happens at a lot of big temples in India anyway.\n \nOne b=\r\nottomline is that everything is slowly more and more corrupted in Kali yuga=\r\n. Even fruits are laced with artificial chemicals and pesticides. Even milk=\r\n in western countries contains chicken fat and hormones. All food contains =\r\nheavy and dangerous chemicals. More and more, we shun copper and other meta=\r\nl containers and use plastic, thermocoal and other dangerous materials to s=\r\ntore food and heat food (and end up consuming small quantities of those mat=\r\nerials). We use microwave radiation to heat food. The food and drinks going=\r\n into us contain gradually more dangerous chemicals that slowly dull the mi=\r\nnd. What can we do? Kali will get denser and denser. We can put brakes now =\r\nand then and slow it down, but we cannot stop it.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha=\r\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo Gana=\r\npathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http:/=\r\n/vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJaganna=\r\nth.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n=\r\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Chandra Prakash \n  To: Narasimha PV=\r\nR Rao ; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Saturday, March 08, 2008 11:2=\r\n7 AM\n  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: MahaShivratri\n\n\n  Dear Narasimha,\n\n  Tha=\r\nnks to you and Ajit for the clarifications.

I had sent an \n  e-mail yesterday about a related topic yesterd=\r\nay but it has not been posted as \n  yet, so I am resending it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As I =\r\nwas watching the Shiva Abhishekam at \n  the temple with milk, curd, ghee et=\r\nc. an issue came up and I would appreciate \n  your opinion/thoughts on it.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Use of dairy products (milk, curd, ghee) \n  is extolled in our tradi=\r\ntion and is encouraged as part of a saatwik lifestyle. \n  However, in this =\r\nKali yuga, the reality is that the cows that provide these \n  dairy product=\r\ns for our consumption and use in religious rituals, suffer \n  terribly thro=\r\nughout their life and meet a painful end. This is specially true \n  in larg=\r\ne dairy operations in America but I suspect it would be true elsewhere \n  t=\r\noo.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So, how do you reconcile the religious beliefs/doctrine and the =\r\n\n  reality of today&#39;s life, with respect to using diary products.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I =\r\nam \n  providing a link to a website that was sent to me by a friend. Note: =\r\nThe \n  documentaries on the website, specially &quot;Earthlings&quot; are quite graph=\r\nic and may \n  not be for everyone but they do depict a reality that is goin=\r\ng on these days. \n  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://veg-tv.info/Main_Page&quot; =\r\n\n  target=3D_blank&gt;http://veg-tv.info/Main_Page&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;warm \n  r=\r\negards,&lt;BR&gt;Chandraprakash&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n  &lt;DIV \n  style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; FONT-=\r\nFAMILY: times new roman,new york,times,serif&quot;&gt;----- \n  Original Message ---=\r\n-&lt;BR&gt;From: Narasimha PVR Rao \n  &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Cc: Chandra \n  Prakash &lt;vedicstudent@...&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Sent: Wednesday, March 5, 2008 \n  8:39:49 AM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: MahaShivratr=\r\ni&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As Ajit \n  Krishnan has clarified correctly, Maha =\r\nShivaratri is to be observed on the \n  night of March 5 (Wednesday - today)=\r\n in the entire north America.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some \n  temples in USA are observing i=\r\nt on Thursday night, but there ARE some temples \n  that are observing it co=\r\nrrectly on Wednesday.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Happy Maha Shivaratri to \n  all of you!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Best \n  regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;-----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Do \n  Ganapathi Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot; \n  target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom&quot; \n  target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish \n  lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.h=\r\nome.comcast.net&quot; \n  target=3D_blank&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Free Jyotish software \n  (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org&quot; \n  target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jaganna=\r\nth Centre (SJC) \n  website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot; \n  targ=\r\net=3D_blank&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- \n  Chandra Prakash &lt;&lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;mailto:vedicstudent@...&quot; \n  ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedicstudent@=\r\nyahoo.com&quot;&gt;vedicstudent@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: \n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Narasimha=\r\n,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thank you for your enlightening and \n  inspiring posts. =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Could you please clarify when we are \n  supposed to celeb=\r\nrate MahaShivratri this year in America.
