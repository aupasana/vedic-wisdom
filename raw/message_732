From God&#39;s point of view, different people have different mental conditioning and suitable for different tasks.\n \nBut, from our point of view, we should only look at ourselves as a servant and strive to be a more loyal servant.\n \nA servant who does not care whether there is a check or cash for one million dollars or one hundred dollars in the bag, loyally considers the bag in his possession his master&#39;s property, fights to keep the bag safe despite all obstacles, irrespective of what&#39;s inside, and does not even open the bag to check what&#39;s inside, is the ideal servant that can entrusted to carry a bag containing anything.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- malladi_bharathi &lt;malladi_bharathi@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Utpal,\n&gt; \n&gt; I liked Narasimha&#39;s analogy a lot.

But, if \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; does, don&#39;t worry. Re-ignite it as Narayan said, pray to Agni in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; mind and continue.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose a servant is asked by his master to carry a vessel of \n&gt; milk \n&gt; &gt; to a place without spilling it on the way. Suppose a little milk \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; spilled on the way. What should he do? Should he abandon the \n&gt; project \n&gt; &gt; or atleast carry the remaining milk to the destination?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As Narayan said, fire going away can signal the bhutagni being \n&gt; weak.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But, one is better off ignoring those things and not thinking \n&gt; too \n&gt; &gt; much about the significance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I recommend doing homam without worrying about how well or badly \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; went and what results it brought. Let me give an analogy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your favorite deity as the master and yourself as a \n&gt; &gt; servant. A servant simply serves the master. Similarly, all the \n&gt; &gt; sadhana you do and your other activities are your way to serve \n&gt; your \n&gt; &gt; master.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have many big checks \n&gt; &gt; everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail others. \n&gt; &gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the bank \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; world and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in \n&gt; this \n&gt; &gt; world. That is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and \n&gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming back to earth every now and then. The \n&gt; &gt; supreme god of this world operates through various physical \n&gt; persons \n&gt; &gt; present on earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves and \n&gt; try \n&gt; &gt; to help others, because that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant \n&gt; carries \n&gt; &gt; master&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded by others as good work tends to promote \n&gt; ego \n&gt; &gt; and we need to guard against it. A servant carrying a million \n&gt; dollar \n&gt; &gt; check to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant \n&gt; &gt; carrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are merely \n&gt; &gt; doing their master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are just \n&gt; &gt; *instruments* used by the master to carry out his agenda. \n&gt; Similarly, \n&gt; &gt; one who does what are considered great deeds in this world and one \n&gt; &gt; who does what are considered meagre deeds in this world are both \n&gt; &gt; servants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in this world. \n&gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything. One may consider oneself superior to \n&gt; &gt; the other because his/her deeds are considered superior by the \n&gt; world, \n&gt; &gt; but he/she is just as foolish as a servant who considers \n&gt; &gt; himself/herself superior to another servant carrying something \n&gt; less \n&gt; &gt; valuable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates \n&gt; one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what \n&gt; &gt; situations his previous karmas place one in. One can remain happy \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; blissful in pleasure and pain, in praise and criticism and in \n&gt; light \n&gt; &gt; and darkness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It is a \n&gt; job \n&gt; &gt; you are doing for god. You do the best you can. But you own \n&gt; nothing. \n&gt; &gt; You are doing it for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Sent: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Reading your response another question came into my \n&gt; mind. \n&gt; &gt; You said:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;          It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in the \n&gt; &gt; middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Is it not good that the fire gets extinguished by rain, \n&gt; or \n&gt; &gt; the fact that the fire is getting extinguished?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         I mean actyually i feel when someone starts doing homa \n&gt; &gt; regularly, there can be instances when the homa agni gets \n&gt; &gt; extinguished while the homa is still on..happened with me couple \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; times... i seriously dont knbow what to make of it but as one \n&gt; member \n&gt; &gt; in this list had suggested to me,  i relight the fire and keep \n&gt; &gt; continuing with the homa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;          \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         --- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati \n&gt; Homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsverysimple@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Date: Thursday, 4 December, 2008, 6:48 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Namaste Phani,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house\n&gt; (3-\n&gt; &gt; floors) ? Can a homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand base \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; used instead of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; copper one?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the open \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; actually better than doing it in closed space. But realize that a \n&gt; &gt; rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the \n&gt; fire \n&gt; &gt; if it rains while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is \n&gt; &gt; extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and \n&gt; sand \n&gt; &gt; at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio \n&gt; file, \n&gt; &gt; should one repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; mantras mentally along with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           One can repeat mentally while listening attentively \n&gt; (not \n&gt; &gt; casually). Actually, even listening to mantras with all the \n&gt; attention \n&gt; &gt; focused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking of \n&gt; &gt; some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening to \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; with focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the \n&gt; mantra \n&gt; &gt; may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from the \n&gt; &gt; mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One \n&gt; can \n&gt; &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is \n&gt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           However, there is a difference between meditation and \n&gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation and \n&gt; it \n&gt; &gt; is submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So making \n&gt; some \n&gt; &gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to \n&gt; silent \n&gt; &gt; chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other \n&gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain food?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) \n&gt; &gt; has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them \n&gt; &gt; strictly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food on \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; day of homam and take a bath before homam. Another rule I will \n&gt; &gt; recommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do \n&gt; &gt; homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take responsibility \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as \n&gt; guru \n&gt; &gt; and perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; process until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity \n&gt; &gt; through homam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no \n&gt; &gt; sacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter \n&gt; &gt; after a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. The \n&gt; &gt; goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed this \n&gt; up \n&gt; &gt; and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           As long as one desires no specific material benefits \n&gt; (and \n&gt; &gt; ready to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual \n&gt; &gt; progress, I am willing to help, even if it means some suffering \n&gt; for \n&gt; &gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day would \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; fine?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi \n&gt; morning. \n&gt; &gt; But any day is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my \n&gt; India \n&gt; &gt; trip.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish \n&gt; &gt; traveled together to several places (on a specific project). We \n&gt; ended \n&gt; &gt; up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we \n&gt; were). \n&gt; &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. As \n&gt; &gt; monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not take it \n&gt; &gt; seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to the \n&gt; &gt; rooftop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. Manish \n&gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city \n&gt; after \n&gt; &gt; our homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           To my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas \n&gt; &gt; finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started \n&gt; raining \n&gt; &gt; with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on \n&gt; &gt; the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of the two \n&gt; small \n&gt; &gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held the cloth \n&gt; cover \n&gt; &gt; on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas went off and \n&gt; &gt; then packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshetra \n&gt; later \n&gt; &gt; that day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued for a few \n&gt; days \n&gt; &gt; in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we covered \n&gt; &gt; the north, east and west of India. It rained in every place we \n&gt; went \n&gt; &gt; to, as we finished our task in that place and prepared to move on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --\n&gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n&gt; &gt; wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. \n&gt; &gt; home..comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: \n&gt; http://www.SriJagan \n&gt; &gt; nath..org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --\n&gt; ---\n&gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; \n&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; have few questions\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; regarding it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house\n&gt; (3-\n&gt; &gt; floors) ?
