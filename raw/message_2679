Kapalikas were followers of a particul=\r\nar Saiva sect (the left-hand\n&gt; order) who always carried human skulls, wore=\r\n them as garlands around their\n&gt; necks and even ate and drank from these ma=\r\ncabre vessels. Lord Siva himself\n&gt; is hailed as Kapali. The Lord of the fam=\r\nous temple in Mylapore in Chennai is\n&gt; worshipped as Kapaliswara; why is an=\r\nother story.\n&gt; &gt; This Kapalika had been nursing a grievance against Adi San=\r\nkara whom he\n&gt; viewed as a potential threat to his faith and sect. He took =\r\nthe Acharya to a\n&gt; nearby cave, made necessary arrangements for the sacrifi=\r\nce-ritual and\n&gt; prepared himself to behead Adi Sankara. The Acharya was all=\r\n along in a\n&gt; trance.\n&gt; &gt; However, when the Kapalika lifted his sword and r=\r\neadied himself to chop\n&gt; off his head Sankara&#39;s disciple Padmapada (also kn=\r\nown as Sanandana)\n&gt; envisioned this murderous scheme in his mind. He rushed=\r\n to the cave in a\n&gt; trice. In an &#39;avesa&#39; (possessed with divine powers) of =\r\nLord Narasimha he,\n&gt; verily, became the man-lion Lord himself temporarily. =\r\nHe had attained\n&gt; Narasimha mantra siddhi and, becoming frightfully ferocio=\r\nus, caught hold of\n&gt; the villainous Kapalika and tore him to pieces.\n&gt; &gt; Sa=\r\nnkara Vijaya, published by the Ramakrishna Math in Chennai, describes\n&gt; how=\r\n Padmapada leapt into the sky, scattering away the clouds with a slash of\n&gt;=\r\n his mane, and literally flew into the cave, stunning all beholders. It was=\r\n a\n&gt; re-enactment of the Narasimha incarnation once again when the demon\n&gt; =\r\nHiranyakasipu was disembowelled by the Lord with his leonine claws.\n&gt; &gt; Adi=\r\n Sankara, hearing the thunderous roars of a lion, awoke from his\n&gt; trance a=\r\nnd witnessed the gory scene. Padmapada&#39;s body was smeared with the\n&gt; blood =\r\nof the vile Kapalika while his face glowed with divine splendour like\n&gt; a g=\r\nalaxy of suns. The Acharya saw before him the awesome Lord Narasimha\n&gt; hims=\r\nelf and pacified him with soothing and overflowing devotion.\n&gt; &gt; On another=\r\n occasion, Adi Sankara&#39;s hands got burnt (the Amaruka episode)\n&gt; but he was=\r\n cured by extolling Lord Narasimha through the famous hyms, the\n&gt; 17-verse =\r\nLakshmi Narasimha Karavalamba Stotram (also known as Lakshmi\n&gt; Narasimha Ka=\r\nrunarasa Stotram&#39;). These hymns are so titled because each of\n&gt; these verse=\r\ns ends with the same refrain &#39;Lakshmi Narasimha, mama dehi\n&gt; karavalambam&#39; =\r\n(O Lord Narasimha, please lend me your helping hand).\n&gt; &gt; It is believed th=\r\nat fervent recitation of these hymns on Lord Narasimha\n&gt; (one of the two st=\r\notras Adi Sankara composed on Him) will always help one\n&gt; smoothly get over=\r\n difficulties with the Lord&#39;s helping hand.\n&gt; &gt; Salagrama, the sacred stone=\r\n found only in the Kandaki river in Nepal, and\n&gt; worshipped by Vaishnavites=\r\n in their homes, is used in the puja of Sri Kanchi\n&gt; Kamakoti Peetam. This =\r\nis said to be specially sacred to Lord Narasimha and\n&gt; is believed to have =\r\nbeen given to Adi Sankara by Lord Narasimha himself.\n&gt; &gt; R Srinivasan &quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt;

Kapalikas were followers of a particular Saiva sect (the left-hand o=\r\nrder) who always carried human skulls, wore them as garlands around their n=\r\necks and even ate and drank from these macabre vessels. Lord Siva himself i=\r\ns hailed as Kapali. The Lord of the famous temple in Mylapore in Chennai is=\r\n worshipped as Kapaliswara; why is another story.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This Kapalika ha=\r\nd been nursing a grievance against Adi Sankara whom he viewed as a potentia=\r\nl threat to his faith and sect. He took the Acharya to a nearby cave, made =\r\nnecessary\n arrangements for the sacrifice-ritual and prepared himself to be=\r\nhead Adi Sankara. The Acharya was all along in a trance.&lt;br&gt;&gt; However, w=\r\nhen the Kapalika lifted his sword and readied himself to chop off his head =\r\nSankara&#39;s disciple Padmapada (also known as Sanandana) envisioned this =\r\nmurderous scheme in his mind. He rushed to the cave in a trice. In an &#39;=\r\navesa&#39; (possessed with divine powers) of Lord Narasimha he, verily, bec=\r\name the man-lion Lord himself temporarily. He had attained Narasimha mantra=\r\n siddhi and, becoming frightfully ferocious, caught hold of the villainous =\r\nKapalika and tore him to pieces.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sankara Vijaya, published by the =\r\nRamakrishna Math in Chennai, describes how Padmapada leapt into the sky, sc=\r\nattering away the clouds with a slash of his mane, and literally flew into =\r\nthe cave, stunning all beholders. It was a re-enactment of the Narasimha in=\r\ncarnation once again when the demon Hiranyakasipu was disembowelled by the =\r\nLord with his\n leonine claws.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Adi Sankara, hearing the thunderous r=\r\noars of a lion, awoke from his trance and witnessed the gory scene. Padmapa=\r\nda&#39;s body was smeared with the blood of the vile Kapalika while his fac=\r\ne glowed with divine splendour like a galaxy of suns. The Acharya saw befor=\r\ne him the awesome Lord Narasimha himself and pacified him with soothing and=\r\n overflowing devotion.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; On another occasion, Adi Sankara&#39;s hand=\r\ns got burnt (the Amaruka episode) but he was cured by extolling Lord Narasi=\r\nmha through the famous hyms, the 17-verse Lakshmi Narasimha Karavalamba Sto=\r\ntram (also known as Lakshmi Narasimha Karunarasa Stotram&#39;). These hymns=\r\n are so titled because each of these verses ends with the same refrain &#39=\r\n;Lakshmi Narasimha, mama dehi karavalambam&#39; (O Lord Narasimha, please l=\r\nend me your helping hand).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is believed that fervent recitation =\r\nof these hymns on Lord Narasimha (one of the two stotras Adi Sankara compos=\r\ned on Him) will always help\n one smoothly get over difficulties with the Lo=\r\nrd&#39;s helping hand.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Salagrama, the sacred stone found only in th=\r\ne Kandaki river in Nepal, and worshipped by Vaishnavites in their homes, is=\r\n used in the puja of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam. This is said to be special=\r\nly sacred to Lord Narasimha and is believed to have been given to Adi Sanka=\r\nra by Lord Narasimha himself.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; R Srinivasan &quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n *This masterly introduction by Mr.R.Srivasan is taken from www.chennaionli=\r\nne. com&lt;br&gt;&gt;
