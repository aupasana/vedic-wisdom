A building may be made of thousands of bricks, but each brick is important.\n \nHowever, let us not be forceful or agreessive like the missionaries. Also, let us do our work without any kind of expectations. If we passionately tell someone about the importance of spiritual sadhana and homam, for example, we should do so without an expectation that that person will start acting on our words. We cannot (and should not try to) compel anyone to do even what we believe to be worthy.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- vishal sharma &lt;mbavishal@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Hi Narsimaha ji\n&gt; Namaste charan sparash\n&gt; \n&gt; With the blessings of mother I am also trying to speard the word about the\n&gt; homam using my facebook account.

I received\n&gt; &gt; fantastic compliments from several learned people, both from west and India,\n&gt; &gt; for a clear and balanced presentation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A writeup that tries to capture that presentation is now available for a\n&gt; &gt; free download.

Otherwise, kindly ignore.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, I followed up this presentation with a two hour practical workshop,\n&gt; &gt; where I explained the why and how of homam and did a practical\n&gt; &gt; demonstration. According to the organizers, that workshop was the most\n&gt; &gt; attended event of the entire conference. My goal was to inspire some people\n&gt; &gt; to perform a quick 20 min homam by themselves on a regular basis.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; PVR Narasimha Rao\n\n\n"}}
