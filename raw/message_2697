If your inherent sattwa is not high enough to resist the tamas \noutside, you may not be able to focus the mind on the ritual well and be \nalert.\n\nDoing it after sunset is fine. But I suggest not waiting till late in the \nnight and doing it as early as possible. If you do very late, there is NO \nharm. But simply the benefit may be les, if there is an additional layer of \ntamas on your consciousness due to the Nature of time.\n\nOnce I witnessed a Ganapathi homam performed in the backyard of a priest&#39;s \nhouse, next to a river, late in the night. There were four really good \npriests there and it was one of the most pleasant Ganapathi homams I \nwitnessed. IF you have enough sattwa to mix with the quality of gunas in \nNature during night, it can generate a different kind of nice feeling. Only \nthing is that not much happens if there is very little sattwa in you \ninherently.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;homamstudent&quot; &lt;vedichoroscope@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, September 30, 2009 10:21 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Time to do Homam\n\n\n&gt; Narasimhaji,\n&gt;\n&gt; I do a daily homam in the morning before leaving for work but sometimes \n&gt; due to time constraints it is not possible and in that case I come back \n&gt; from work and perform the homam in the evening.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there a time in the day beyond which performing a homam is not advised \n&gt; such as sunset, etc?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt;\n&gt; Veenu\n\n\n"}}
