I have problems that put me in the =\r\nsame (very) weak situation right now and feel quite hopeless at times. I kn=\r\now to some extent the way out of it, and to some extent I would like to see=\r\n some answers by the knowledgeable on this group especially PVRji.\n\nFirst l=\r\net me tell you this - stop wasting your time in trying to find verbal logic=\r\n to &quot;prove&quot; the existence of the concept of &quot;God&quot;. People will present you =\r\nwith lots of different logical and illogical arguments. Logical arguments, =\r\neven scriptural ones, dont give permanent relief. Both your fears, and your=\r\n real problems, will certainly overwhelm any logical arguments eventually. =\r\nThere must be real growth (real internal change) for real relief.\n\nNow, let=\r\n me give you some basic logic. I am not contradicting myself, just the logi=\r\nc will not help you. It simply opens a path, you must follow it to some min=\r\nor extent at least to see the light. Otherwise, simply as logic, it will ce=\r\nrtainly fail. So here it is..\n\nIn my very simple and totally honest observa=\r\ntion, I notice that thinking of other people&#39;s problems DOES NOT give me ev=\r\nen one-tenth as much pain as thinking of my own problems. Do you agree that=\r\n it is the same for you? So, clearly, the concept of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;ownership&quot; is=\r\n the key pathway for the pain. Now, there are 2 possibilities here - either=\r\n there is nothing more than the I (the atheistic view), or there is somethi=\r\nng more than the I (the theistic view). The first path for you and me leads=\r\n to continuous pain (at least right now), because it means either there is =\r\npain or there is nothing, because at least I can&#39;t think of any easy materi=\r\nal solution to my problems - they must be lived through. So the first path =\r\nis not very useful. So, you will agree that it is worthwhile to at least tr=\r\ny out the second path. Now, if the second path is real, there is something =\r\nmore than the I, so there must be a way to at least temporarily disassociat=\r\ne your deeper consciousness from the &quot;I&quot; and &quot;ownership&quot; that is the key pa=\r\nthway to the pain? For me, I have found that concentration meditation (even=\r\n with mantras) wasn&#39;t doing the trick. I switched to complete surrender bas=\r\ned meditation in which I actually gave myself to whatever it is that is out=\r\n there (for me this was a long path, eventually I found through dreams and =\r\nhints that it had to be a mother based form that I had to give myself up to=\r\n). Now this is easier said than done. You cant form the words &quot;I give up my=\r\nself to you&quot; in your mind. That is totally, thoroughly, useless, because th=\r\ne moment you form the words, the &quot;I&quot; proudly takes control and starts tryin=\r\ng to give up everything but itself. Somewhere within your meditating mind &quot;=\r\nyou&quot; must catch yourself and let it to go. This is the very subjective part=\r\n - I cant help anymore  with this part since it is a very personal thing - =\r\nbut nevertheless is key to any success.\n\nIt is at this point that I get the=\r\n proof, and I expect you will too. Rather than disappearing into nothingnes=\r\ns or sleep, which is what you might expect, at least sometimes (and sometim=\r\nes not on very bad days), I feel a rush of expansive, blissful relief. Pure=\r\n, blessed, much needed relief from the troubles of the mind. It is very exp=\r\nansive, you might suddenly get a thought of you falling into a huge ocean, =\r\nor an endless green field in warm sunlight.\n\nSo that&#39;s the good part. The p=\r\noint is, when I come out of it, I am the same old angry, bitter, stressed o=\r\nut person (trust me, I make the same old mistakes all over again). But with=\r\n one difference - I have a memory of something pure - and that makes me kee=\r\np on going.\n\nNow the question to PVRji - I understand that the relief corre=\r\nsponds in some sense to a small patch of nirvikalpa samadhi. But exactly as=\r\n outlined in Tripura Rahasya, it does not correlate with real life. So is i=\r\nt correct to say that if you want to have any kind of real life enlightenme=\r\nnt or improvement in your actions, you must necessarily do some Shakti type=\r\n worship?\n\nBest regards,\n\nSundeep \n\n\n\n \n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, Astro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have tried=\r\n to make spiritual progress for long, and made little progress (but \n&gt; not =\r\nsignificant). Ever since my childhood, primarily because of my upbringing, =\r\nI \n&gt; have been trying and observing a lot of &quot;Good&quot; things. I have been rea=\r\nding texts \n&gt; on spirituality and was a lot impressed by Swami Vivekananda&#39;=\r\ns writings. I \n&gt; always found Kabir&#39;s following lines, as a best (and most =\r\ncompact) commentary on \n&gt; the two prominent paths of spirituality: -\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;=\r\nEk kahoon to hai nahee, do kahoon to gaari&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Hai jaisa taisa rahe, kahat =\r\nkabir vicharee&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; i.e.\n&gt; &quot;If I say One, it is not, If I say two, it is c=\r\nontemplation&quot;\n&gt; &quot;Let it be what it is, says Kabir after contemplation&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Until last year, my faith was getting stronger and stronger in my beliefs.=\r\n Last \n&gt; year made gave me lot of troubles as well as lot of personal time =\r\nto think. I \n&gt; have come up with several doubts (just a few given below) ab=\r\nout spirituality and \n&gt; God and Goodness, and I have started to feel gettin=\r\ng drifted towards atheism \n&gt; (susprisingly am writing all this on Vaikuntha=\r\n Ekadashi, when am observing a \n&gt; fast). If someone can help me understand =\r\nthe problesm with my doubts, it would \n&gt; be great help:- \n&gt; \n&gt; - Isn&#39;t &quot;Ish=\r\nwar Paridhaan&quot; i.e. &quot;Ishwar yat karoti shobhanam karoti&quot; same as \n&gt; stockho=\r\nlm syndrome? \n&gt; - Most people with good conduct I see these days are suffer=\r\ning and those who \n&gt; happily claim themselves to be atheists, lead a prospe=\r\nrous life. Where is the \n&gt; supreme power&#39;s role in this. I know materialism=\r\n is a different issue, but last \n&gt; year made me realize that materialistic =\r\ntroubles made me very weak spiritually \n&gt; too. So, I dont see them to be co=\r\nnnected somehow.\n&gt; - I do understand that in Kali Yuga, the patience levels=\r\n are low, and so called \n&gt; Godly correction of the wrong doing, takes its o=\r\nwn time. But doesn&#39;t that \n&gt; promotes the bad karma in itself, specially in=\r\n this yuga? And how long can one \n&gt; wait?\n&gt; - Suicide is considered a great=\r\nest sin, as it is throwing away the best gift we \n&gt; get from the lord. But,=\r\n I am not sure that if people do it for fun. God presents \n&gt; a person with =\r\ntough situations in the name of testing times, and some day the \n&gt; limit is=\r\n reached. Then isn&#39;t god accomplice in this so called crime.\n&gt; - In first p=\r\nlace, why does he need to test us?\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said that all these question m=\r\nake me feel that I am losing the faith in His \n&gt; goodness. All my spiritual=\r\n progress if any has been corrupted by these testing \n&gt; times. And no help =\r\ncame to me(I could not figure out). And those who did offer, \n&gt; faced a lot=\r\n of troubles themselves and are also suffering now. This is what \n&gt; makes m=\r\ne go mad about it, as I am unable to bear this that I have passed my \n&gt; ago=\r\nny to someone.\n&gt; \n&gt; Despite all these thoughts that have pre-occupied my mi=\r\nnd for quite some time, I \n&gt; feel that I still survive a chance to get back=\r\n to my faith in real terms and not \n&gt; driven by materialistic desire. This =\r\nis the reason I am writing this mail. May \n&gt; be someone can make me see wha=\r\nt I am missing here. Else, I see myself getting \n&gt; totally crazy, insane an=\r\nd moving towards atheism and quit possibly committing \n&gt; the so called &quot;Sin=\r\n&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Sri\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
