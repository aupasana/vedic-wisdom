Allow me to add some perspective to it,=\r\n which may or may-not be helpful.\n\n&lt;&lt;How outrageous that for centuries, and=\r\n even today, women were not \nallowed to be initiated into the Gayatri (whic=\r\nh is to the Goddess). Why \naren&#39;t there more women saints? The ratio of fem=\r\nale to male saints is \nprobably 1:10. It&#39;s bloody disheartening. And what i=\r\ns the point of \ncovering us with ignorance (it&#39;s her fault, she is the Avid=\r\nya Maya), and then yelling at us for not being wise (as she does in all the=\r\n \nscriptures).&gt;&gt;\n\nI assume from your words that you have been exposed to so=\r\nme standard view-points about Durga, (Avidya/Maya and all that stuff). In s=\r\nome branches of the Adwaitha philosophy it is said that Shakti (Durga) is M=\r\naya and Avidya. Irony being that, adherents of these branches were hardly t=\r\nhe folks, historically speaking, who chief deity was Ma Durga.\n\nThe path th=\r\nat *actually* worshiped Her, was/is Tantra, which believes, there is no &quot;Av=\r\nidya&quot; at all. Brahman/the-state-called-Atman is true, and so is the world o=\r\nf duality which is but a manifestation/projection of that core. In the path=\r\n of Tantra, which was neither mainstream nor geographically widespread, the=\r\nre was never any restriction to females with respect to sadhana. Not only w=\r\nere women initiated, but there were fantastic women of exceptional spiritua=\r\nl caliber, and they used to be classified based on the levels they had achi=\r\neved as &quot;uttara-sadhikas&quot;, &quot;bhairavis&quot; and &quot;yoginis&quot;. While mainstream Hind=\r\nuism was busy burning widows alive in the name of some dubious rules, Tantr=\r\nas boldly declared Sati-daha as an abomination, rejected the caste-system t=\r\notally, and allowed women the status of spiritual preceptors when they coul=\r\nd attain certain states. One of the Gurus of Sri Ramakrishna was a Bhairavi=\r\n who taught him Tantra. The first person to worship\n UgraTara south of the =\r\nVindya Hills was the wife of a disciple of Sri Ramana Maharishi, who was in=\r\nitiated into this worship by a Bhairavi in Mithila. If a Bhairavi has the c=\r\naliber to teach a Ramakrishna, would she not have the caliber to act as gur=\r\nus for average folks? Sure. But then, history does not even record her real=\r\n name. Why? Because, the system of Tantra as well as those who followed the=\r\n path - both men and women - were firmly rejected by mainstream brahminical=\r\n Hinduism; thus they never gained any popularity, except for the wrong reas=\r\nons. \n\n\nEvery worship of Durga that happens anywhere today is India is stil=\r\nl a watered-down version from the Tantras. The concept of ChanDi Homa was f=\r\nirst mentioned in the Damara and Katyayani Tantras. In Bengal every rule of=\r\n Durga Puja is from the various Tantric schools. [For example, when creatin=\r\ng an idol of Durga, the mud has to be collected from 4/5 different places s=\r\nuch as from home of a prostitute, a river-bed, a widow&#39;s house, etc etc.] \n=\r\n\n\nSo it is not that those who followed the path of Ma Durga never had women=\r\n saints. Infact, they had more women in their folds who were accorded the h=\r\nighest spiritual status than in mainstream Hinduism. But since Tantra itsel=\r\nf was never popular, neither were these saints popular. And things like fem=\r\nale foeticide were unheard of in places where the worship of the Goddess wa=\r\ns popular. Even the misguided thugees - infamous worshipers of Ma Kali - wh=\r\no were guilty of rampant human-sacrifices, would never dare to offer a woma=\r\nn as a sacrifice to Ma Kali, for they feared of Her wrath since Tantras str=\r\nictly forbid harming the female of any specifies for a worshiper of the God=\r\ndess. So if blame has to be laid for mistreatment of women, objectively it =\r\nwould not fall on those whose chief worship was of Durga or Kali or one of =\r\nHer forms.\n\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\nBazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aa=\r\nge.\nHota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mere aage\n=C2=A0\nEk khel hain aurang-e-sul=\r\nemaan mere nazdeek\nEk baat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.\n\n\n________________=\r\n________________\n From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Saturday, 16 June 2012 12:13 AM\nSubject: [vedi=\r\nc-wisdom] Re: Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;\n \n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n-=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;scsa_taker3&quot; &lt;scsa_taker3@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; First of all, to anyone reading this , please chant mentally while\n&gt; re=\r\nading, time is running out, who knows when you will reach the\n&gt; cremation g=\r\nround, chant and chant.

Sound advice no doubt.\n\nU=\r\nnfortunately Durga is partial to some of her children it seems, and not all=\r\n of us are blessed with the intense desire to chant as you seem to be. Stop=\r\n rubbing it in please. \n\nWhat is the use of asking us to chant more? Ask he=\r\nr to give us this desire, as she seems to have done for you. \n\nWhich brings=\r\n me to ranting a bit about the general injustice of our esteemed Durga. The=\r\n Atman is sexless, but the Atman in female form has been treated worse than=\r\n the Atman in male form over the centuries...even today it is being murdere=\r\nd in the womb (female foeticide), raped, burnt in Sati etc etc. Yes yes it =\r\nis deathless etc, but while in this ignorant state, it still suffers in the=\r\n form of women. I hasten to add that I am no feminist but right now, I&#39;m fu=\r\nrious with Durga. How outrageous that for centuries, and even today, women =\r\nwere not allowed to be initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the Goddess)=\r\n. Why aren&#39;t there more women saints? The ratio of female to male saints is=\r\n probably 1:10. It&#39;s bloody disheartening. And what is the point of coverin=\r\ng us with ignorance (it&#39;s her fault, she is the Avidya Maya), and then yell=\r\ning at us for not being wise (as she does in all the scriptures). If she wa=\r\nnts to save us, she will have to create in us the desire\n to do japa or wha=\r\ntever. I wash my hands of the whole thing.\n\nSo don&#39;t tell us to chant, tell=\r\n her to tell us to chant. Like she told you to. It&#39;s not our fault.\n\nOk ran=\r\nt over. I&#39;m going to control my temper and do some Om Namo Narayanaya repet=\r\nition now. Who knows when it&#39;s time for the cremation ground? You did it fo=\r\nr a select few, but not for the rest of us millions- Damn you Durga. \n\nApar=\r\nna\n\n\n \r\n--1355684428-1188185366-1339859594=:49027\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ve=\r\nrdana, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Namaste,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Very authentic questions!

So if blame ha=\r\ns to be laid for mistreatment of women, objectively it would not fall on th=\r\nose whose chief worship was of Durga or Kali or one of Her forms.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_=\r\n0_86_133985514638169&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdan=\r\na;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D=\r\n&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#000066;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span=\r\n&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#a2a2a2&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Bazeecha-e=\r\n-atfal hain duniya mere aage.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#000066;&quot;&gt;&lt;span\n class=3D&quot;Apple-st=\r\nyle-span&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#a2a2=\r\na2&quot;&gt;Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mere aage&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#000066;&quot;&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;App=\r\nle-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#000099;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;FO=\r\nNT-SIZE:medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#999999=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;FO=\r\nNT-SIZE:medium;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#999999=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Ek baat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div\n style=3D&quot;font-family: verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; fo=\r\nnt-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new york, time=\r\ns, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D=\r\n&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;=\r\n sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-w=\r\neight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, 16 June 2012 12:13 AM&lt;=\r\nbr&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Re: Karmic liability for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;off&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv=\r\n750256674&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv750256674ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;scsa_taker3&quot; &lt;scsa_taker3@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; First of all, to anyone reading this , please chant mentall=\r\ny while&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; reading, time is running out, who knows when you will reac=\r\nh the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; cremation ground, chant and chant. For those who don&#39;t have =\r\nanything to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; chant, please chant ram, waheguru, allah or any name, =\r\nmentally. Recite&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; any mantra, anything, every waking moment should =\r\nbe devoted to god,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; because its the only worthwhile thing to do as =\r\na human.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Bolo hari bolo gopaal bolo&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThanks for the advice=\r\n to chant till the cremation ground. Sound advice no doubt.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nUnfort=\r\nunately Durga is partial to some of her children it seems, and not all of u=\r\ns are blessed with the intense desire to chant as you seem to be. Stop rubb=\r\ning it in please. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhat is the use of asking us to chant more? Ask=\r\n her to give us this desire, as she seems to have done for you. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nW=\r\nhich brings me to ranting a bit about the general injustice of our esteemed=\r\n Durga. The Atman is sexless, but the Atman in female form has been treated=\r\n worse than the Atman in male form over the centuries...even today it is be=\r\ning murdered in the womb (female foeticide), raped, burnt in Sati etc etc. =\r\nYes yes it is deathless etc, but while in this ignorant state, it still suf=\r\nfers in the form of women. I hasten to add that I am no feminist but right =\r\nnow, I&#39;m furious with Durga. How outrageous that for centuries, and even to=\r\nday, women were not allowed to be initiated into the Gayatri (which is to t=\r\nhe Goddess). Why aren&#39;t there more women saints? The ratio of female to mal=\r\ne saints is probably 1:10. It&#39;s bloody disheartening. And what is the point=\r\n of covering us with ignorance (it&#39;s her fault, she is the Avidya Maya), an=\r\nd then yelling at us for not being wise (as she does in all the scriptures)=\r\n. If she wants to save us, she will have to create in us the desire\n to do =\r\njapa or whatever. I wash my hands of the whole thing.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSo don&#39;t tel=\r\nl us to chant, tell her to tell us to chant. Like she told you to. It&#39;s not=\r\n our fault.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOk rant over. I&#39;m going to control my temper and do so=\r\nme Om Namo Narayanaya repetition now. Who knows when it&#39;s time for the crem=\r\nation ground? You did it for a select few, but not for the rest of us milli=\r\nons- Damn you Durga. &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAparna&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;on=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1355684428-1188185366-1339859594=:49027--\r\n\n"}}
