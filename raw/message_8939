It surely clarifi=\r\ned some of my doubts (important ones).\n\n I tried limiting food, sleep and b=\r\neing celibate for a while now (since a year). Thus is my observation:\n\n1. S=\r\nleep: Logically the meditation itself should reduce our sleep requirements.=\r\n However, sleep increases in the early stages since meditation agitates the=\r\n mind initially. This continues till the mind gets into the habit of relaxi=\r\nng and being still. Once this barrier is crossed one can sleep for even les=\r\ns than 6 hrs without side-effects.  \nQuickfix: Somewhere i read tat sleepin=\r\ng in a totally dark room helps improve the sleep quality and quickly get in=\r\nto deep sleep. This also reduces the need to sleep for long hours. I sleep =\r\nwith a cloth wrapped around my eyes since its not possible to make my room =\r\ntotally dark.\n\n2. Food: How much exactly should one eat so tat it is consid=\r\nered limited? While having food we normally burp at least twice or more. Th=\r\ne first burp indicates that the stomach is half full and the second burp co=\r\nmes when it is three-fourth full. Sadhaks should stop eating at the first b=\r\nurp itself and drink water to fill the next quarter of the stomach. If one =\r\nproperly chews the food and eats slowly one will surely get these burps and=\r\n will not feel tired after having food. The second burp is a warning even f=\r\nor the sansariks, they should stop eating at this point and leave the rest =\r\nelse they invite digestion related ailments in the long-run. (Source: Healt=\r\nh in your hands book + Hathayoga Pradipika of Svataraman)\n\nNourishment: Mil=\r\nk and clarified butter (Ghee) is a satvik food for sadhaks and also a good =\r\nsource of nourishment. One may also learn &#39;Kechari Mudra&#39; which has a heali=\r\nng effect on the body. Meanwhile since spicy foods hamper progress, one may=\r\n gradually reduce its intake(since they agitate body, the mind also starts =\r\nmoving incessantly).\n\n3.Celibacy: This seems to be the toughest of the thre=\r\ne. Retaining the ojhas looks totally tricky since we lose it during sleep w=\r\nithout warning. Doing &#39;Pada Paschimottanasana&#39; from 30 seconds to 15 minute=\r\ns everyday enhances the retention ability and also cleans our nadis. Amla C=\r\nhoorn is to be mixed with rock candy in the ratio of 1:2. One tablespoon of=\r\n this mixture can be taken half an hour before sleep along with water. This=\r\n not only increases retention power but also drives away wet dreams and the=\r\n veerya is cleansed. (Source: Magazine by Asharam Bapuji).\nMarried: Vajroli=\r\n Mudra (or vajroli kriya or bandha) helps to get orgasm without ejecting an=\r\nd thereby protecting the ojhas even while satisfying the partner. Since one=\r\n does not eject one does not get easily tired and sadhana is not much affec=\r\nted. However, learning this technique is a painstaking process and requires=\r\n complete cooperation of the partner.\n\nI request that experts of this group=\r\n enlighten people with regard to the techniques used by them to overcome th=\r\nese factors.\n\n-Bhavathu Sarva Mangalam-\n\n\n"}}
