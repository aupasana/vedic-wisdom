In other words, if there is no conditioning left, what purpose a jeevan =\r\nMukta would serve in the objective world?\n\nI do nit know if i was clear eno=\r\nugh to explain what i want to ask you.\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;   Namaste Manish,\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI did actually answer you. I wasn&#39;t perhaps clear enough. Obviously, \n&gt; the=\r\nse are not easy ideas to communicate in vaikhari (external \n&gt; communication=\r\n). I pray to Maharshi Vasishtha to imbibe something more \n&gt; than vaikhari i=\r\nn the following words so that people can understand \n&gt; better (not you Mani=\r\nsh, the goal of answering your questions is \n&gt; obviously not to impart any =\r\nknowledge to YOU, but to perhaps benefit \n&gt; some others who may be ready - =\r\nnow or in future).\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is not identif=\r\nication. The problem is *conditioning* (likes, \n&gt; dislikes, wants, agendas =\r\netc) that drives the identification and use of \n&gt; what one&#39;s ahamkara ident=\r\nifies with. If ahamkara (identification) \n&gt; evaporates when chitta (conditi=\r\noning) is cleaned up, it is normal mukti. \n&gt; If ahamkara (identification) r=\r\nemains while chitta (conditioning) is \n&gt; cleaned up, it is jeevanmukti. It =\r\nis as simple as that.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; If one engages in an ac=\r\ntion with zero conditioning, then there is no \n&gt; karma and there are no rin=\r\nas created. Actions (physical or mental) by \n&gt; themselves do not bind one -=\r\n it is the  *conditioned* actions that bind \n&gt; one! It is the likes, dislik=\r\nes, desires, agendas etc (i.e. conditioning \n&gt; in chitta) behind an action =\r\nthat bind one!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; If somebody who is not YET a j=\r\neevanmukta (but close) identified with a \n&gt; body and engaged in an action t=\r\nhat IS driven by some conditioning, \n&gt; however subtle or pure or dharmik th=\r\nat conditioning may be (!), then \n&gt; that sets in motion the law of kaarmik =\r\naction-reaction which will in due \n&gt; time give a particular reaction to wha=\r\nt one identified with when \n&gt; engaging in that action.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the time the=\r\n reaction is experienced, all the conditioning may be \n&gt; overcome and one m=\r\nay become jeevanmukta. Yet, the momentum set in motion \n&gt; before one became=\r\n jeevanmukta will continue to affect the body, senses \n&gt; and sensory mind, =\r\ni.e. whatever one&#39;s ahamkara is identifying with. But, \n&gt; because there is =\r\nno conditioning and hence no agendas, no desires, no \n&gt; likes and dislikes,=\r\n one neither rejoices nor protests nor tries to \n&gt; modify the happenings to=\r\n what one is identifying with.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Sensing that t=\r\nhere is a pain requires no conditioning. It is the \n&gt; function of manas, i.=\r\ne. Chandra. Observing that there is more pain in \n&gt; the evening than mornin=\r\ng (or when swallowing) requires no conditioning. \n&gt; It is the function of b=\r\nuddhi, i.e. Budha. But thinking of praying to god \n&gt; to reduce pain require=\r\ns conditioning in chitta (absent in a \n&gt; jeevanmukta!).\n&gt; \n&gt; Though a jeeva=\r\nnmukta is identifying with a body, one does not view it as \n&gt; something his=\r\n own and something that must be kept in a particular state. \n&gt; He identifie=\r\ns with it, but has no agendas for it. All that comes from \n&gt; conditioning i=\r\nn chitta, which is absent now!\n&gt; \n&gt; The unconditioned identifier (liberated=\r\n I-ness) views what one \n&gt; identifies with as an *amalgam* of portions borr=\r\nowed from various \n&gt; deities (pancha mahabhootas, Moon, Mercury, Indra, Mit=\r\nra, Varuna, Time \n&gt; etc) and hence as a manifestation of Light itself. One =\r\ndoes not view it \n&gt; from the prism of &quot;this is me, I need to use it to purs=\r\nue X or Y \n&gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;this is me. I am made of portions bo=\r\nrrowed \n&gt; from various deities, i.e. various manifestations of Light. I obs=\r\nerve \n&gt; their play, i.e. what they do, and I have no agenda pursue using th=\r\nem.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the essence of Upanishads and Yoga Vaasishtham, as well a=\r\ns \n&gt; Mantra Pushpam that we were discussing a while back.\n&gt; \n&gt; I repeat, id=\r\nentification is not the problem. It is the conditioning that \n&gt; drives how =\r\none uses what one identifies with, that is the problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt; \n&gt; I now feel like I have expressed myself better, though, given ho=\r\nw subtle \n&gt; and nuanced this knowledge is, some people may still get confus=\r\ned (if \n&gt; so, please don&#39;t worry. Not a big deal. Just keep doing sadhana, =\r\nfor \n&gt; that&#39;s the most important thing!). I am grateful to Manish and Mahar=\r\nshi \n&gt; Vasishtha for giving me this opportunity.\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, whether Ramakris=\r\nhna really got throat cancer because of his \n&gt; &quot;insult&quot; of Trilinga Swami o=\r\nr because he took the kaarmik power of \n&gt; attorney from Girish (a drunkard =\r\nand womanizer at the time) can be \n&gt; debated. Strictly speaking, whether Ra=\r\nmakrishna really became a \n&gt; jeevanmukta in that lifetime or not can also b=\r\ne debated.

Not that he was =\r\noblivious to the suffering.\n&gt; And, we say that he was a Jeevanmukta.\n&gt; So h=\r\now can that happen, if according to that definition, the mind must \n&gt; be id=\r\nentifying 24/7 with Atma to be qualified as a Jeevanmukta?\n&gt; \n&gt; The answer =\r\nis straight forward.\n&gt; I await your reply.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kindest regards\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sun=\r\nday, February 19, 2012, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt; pvr@... \n&gt; &lt;javascript:parent.w=\r\ngMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;pvr@...&#39;)&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; As twitter is=\r\n too restrictive a medium, I want to answer a question \n&gt; &gt; that came up in=\r\n an exchange between my guru Manish and me on Twitter, \n&gt; &gt; here. Some port=\r\nions of the Twitter exchange are quoted at the end, in \n&gt; &gt; chronological o=\r\nrder, in case someone is interested in the background.\n&gt; &gt; I will answer th=\r\ne following question posed by Manish based on my \n&gt; &gt; understanding:\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;=\r\n&lt;The question to my mind is this: was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If \n&gt; &gt; so=\r\n, Why did he suffer with throat cancer if he was not identifying \n&gt; &gt; with =\r\nhis actions? (according to your interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; definitio=\r\nn??)&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; * =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Let me elaborate on my understanding of jeevanmukti. Manish loosely \n&gt; &gt; (=\r\nin my view) said in this exchange that rinas are of body and a \n&gt; &gt; jeevanm=\r\nukta continues to fulfil those rinas.\n&gt; &gt; But body is an insentient object.=\r\n It has no rinas. The rinas are not \n&gt; &gt; of the body, but of the mind that =\r\nidentifies with it. It is the \n&gt; &gt; antahkaranas of mind - ahamkara (I-ness)=\r\n and chitta \n&gt; &gt; (memory/conditioning) - that are the source of various rin=\r\nas, \n&gt; &gt; particularly chitta. As mind identifies with a body, it projects i=\r\nts \n&gt; &gt; rinas on the body and makes the body &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, =\r\nin \n&gt; &gt; accordance with those rinas/conditioning.\n&gt; &gt; If the conditioning i=\r\nn chitta is completely wiped out and ahamkara \n&gt; &gt; merges in Self, then it =\r\nis mukti. But, if the conditioning in chitta \n&gt; &gt; is completely wiped out a=\r\nnd yet ahamkara continues to exist with no \n&gt; &gt; limiting notions (it is bas=\r\nically the conditioning in chitta that is \n&gt; &gt; limiting), then one becomes =\r\njeevanmukta (liberated while living).\n&gt; &gt; Unlike in the case of one who lea=\r\nves body and gets mukti, a \n&gt; &gt; jeevanmukta continues to have an I-ness (bu=\r\nt which is not limited by \n&gt; &gt; any notions or conditioning). This unconditi=\r\noned I-ness does project \n&gt; &gt; into a body. But it does not say &quot;I am this b=\r\nody and hence this body \n&gt; &gt; should be kept healthy or strong&quot; (THAT would =\r\nbe conditioning in \n&gt; &gt; chitta, which is wiped out now!). On the other hand=\r\n, it does not \n&gt; &gt; either say &quot;this body should be ignored and destroyed&quot;. =\r\nThough \n&gt; &gt; conditioning is absent now, body keeps experiencing and doing t=\r\nhings \n&gt; &gt; based on the *momentum* set in motion before one became jeevanmu=\r\nkta \n&gt; &gt; and engaged in conditioned experiences and actions. This is like a=\r\n fan \n&gt; &gt; turning for a while after the electricity has been stopped.\n&gt; &gt; M=\r\nanas, buddhi and indriyas keep working as they did before. If one has \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthroat cancer, indriyas may sense pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n process that input and register pain. Buddhi may analyze various \n&gt; &gt; obse=\r\nrvations and draw various conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to \n&gt; &gt; swa=\r\nllow food, it hurts even more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal \n&gt; &gt; liquid, =\r\nit feels better&quot; etc). A normal person whose conditioned mind \n&gt; &gt; (chitta)=\r\n says &quot;I should overcome and not have this pain&quot; may think of \n&gt; &gt; various =\r\nthings to do and struggle with them. But an unconditioned \n&gt; &gt; being has no=\r\n such considerations. Though one may feel and express the \n&gt; &gt; pain and oth=\r\ner objective experiences, one reacts to it differently.\n&gt; &gt; * =C2=A0 =C2=A0=\r\n =C2=A0 =C2=A0* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*\n&gt; &gt; This is a key point:\n&gt; &gt; M=\r\nanas and buddhi are good at making objective observations and \n&gt; &gt; rational=\r\n deductions, but, by themselves, they do not have ANY agenda. \n&gt; &gt; They nei=\r\nther like something nor dislike something. THAT comes from the \n&gt; &gt; conditi=\r\noning in chitta! The hallmark of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is \n&gt; &gt; absent!=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; * =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*\n&gt; &gt; Whethe=\r\nr Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A better way \n&gt; &gt; to ex=\r\npress your question is: Can a jeevanmukta get throat cancer and \n&gt; &gt; feel p=\r\nain? How is it possible if there are no karmas or rinas left?\n&gt; &gt; I have al=\r\nready answered it. But, let me sum it up briefly again. Body, \n&gt; &gt; various =\r\nbody parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and buddhi of a \n&gt; &gt; jeevanmuk=\r\nta continue to operate as before. One&#39;s I-ness is intact and \n&gt; &gt; does proj=\r\nect itself onto those. But neither I-ness nor those things \n&gt; &gt; carry any r=\r\ninas or karmas. Chitta - the repository of conditioning and \n&gt; &gt; rinas - is=\r\n clean. There are no limiting notions. One&#39;s body, indriyas, \n&gt; &gt; manas & b=\r\nuddhi keep experiencing and doing things (good or bad!) based \n&gt; &gt; on the p=\r\nrevious momentum set by the play of rnas and karmas while some \n&gt; &gt; conditi=\r\noning was left in chitta.\n&gt; &gt; Body, various body parts, indriyas of jnana a=\r\nnd karma and manas are \n&gt; &gt; all portions borrowed from various deities. Aha=\r\nmkara (I-ness) infuses \n&gt; &gt; sentience into them by projecting awareness int=\r\no them. The \n&gt; &gt; conditioning in chitta is what drives how all these are vi=\r\newed and \n&gt; &gt; used. Instead of looking at a sense organ as a portion of Ind=\r\nra or \n&gt; &gt; Mitra, one views it as &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, due to condit=\r\nioning \n&gt; &gt; in chitta. That is what creates karmas and rinas. When that \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; conditioning is *completely* overcome, ahamkara can still project \n&gt; &gt; aw=\r\nareness into those objects, but it sees them for what they are. It \n&gt; &gt; doe=\r\ns not have false and limiting notions like &quot;this throat is mine and \n&gt; &gt; MU=\r\nST feel nice and not feel painful&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; * =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0* =C2=\r\n=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0*\n&gt; &gt; Most people who may claim to be (or think the=\r\ny are) jeevanmuktas are \n&gt; &gt; not really jeevanmuktas in today&#39;s world.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nIf one wants to understand the state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nis the best book. The entire discourse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord \n&gt; &gt; R=\r\nama is a detailed and elaborate definition and characterization of a \n&gt; &gt; j=\r\neevanmukta.\n&gt; &gt; There may be other books that explain better how to do vari=\r\nous \n&gt; &gt; sadhanas to progress spiritually and get closer to being liberated=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; oneday. But, when it comes elaborating what liberation while living \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; actually is, there is none better than Yoga Vaasishtham. Of course, \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; one can say that this is merely an intellectual exercise as far as \n&gt; &gt; *=\r\nwe* are concerned. It perhaps is, as none of may ever become a \n&gt; &gt; jeevanm=\r\nukta..\n&gt; &gt; One word of caution: I write with a very confident tone when I h=\r\nave \n&gt; &gt; strong conviction in what I write. That is how I am. But I can \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; definitely be wrong. So please feel free to ignore me! :-)\n&gt; &gt; Happy Shiv=\r\naratri (tomorrow night) to all!\n&gt; &gt; Best regards, Narasimha \n&gt; &gt; ----------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0Free J=\r\nyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings, &quot;Do It \n&gt; &gt; Yourse=\r\nlf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana: =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 Films that make a di=\r\nfference: \n&gt; &gt; http://SaraswatiFilms.org &lt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&gt; =C2=A0=\r\n =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt; =C2=A0Jyotish writings: \n&gt; &gt; h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/JyotishWritings&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=\r\n=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @homam108 \n&gt; &gt; -------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Twitter exchange on jeevanmu=\r\nkta between Manish (twitter handle \n&gt; &gt; @mmpandit) and Narasimha (twitter h=\r\nandle @homam108):\n&gt; &gt; Manish: So, what is a jeevanmukta doing here? Nothing=\r\n really, \n&gt; &gt; fulfilling all rnas, wait for rnas to be over. Narasimha: If =\r\na \n&gt; &gt; &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in &quot;fulfilling all rnas&quot;, will he b bound again?=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; If no, y r they called rnas? If yes, y call him mukta? Manish: No, \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; rnas will work out themselves, slowly or fast as may be the case. The \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; rnas are of the body he or she occupies. He is mukta because he \n&gt; &gt; exp=\r\neriences, actually sees the rnas to be the body&#39;s only. Rnas apply \n&gt; &gt; to =\r\nthe body, not to you. You are that &quot;speck of effulgent light&quot;, call \n&gt; &gt; it=\r\n what you want, Atma, etc. Narasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent \n&gt; &gt; li=\r\nght was never bound. So, who exactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it \n&gt; &gt; h=\r\nave rnas? If these &quot;rnas of body&quot; r somehow not fulfilled after one \n&gt; &gt; bc=\r\nomes jeevanmukta, what happens to one? :-) Manish: You are right. \n&gt; &gt; The =\r\nmind thought, that, it was the body, instead of this light. That \n&gt; &gt; is th=\r\ne original problem. Which every being is born with. Rnas arise \n&gt; &gt; from th=\r\nis identification which creates karma. U r not that, so u r not \n&gt; &gt; bound,=\r\n when the mind realises this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is also not quite \n&gt; &gt; true, s=\r\nince u r that &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginning Narasimha: Then, r the \n&gt; &gt; rnas of t=\r\nhe &quot;body&quot; as u said r of the mind? When a mind identifies \n&gt; &gt; with light &=\r\n bcomes mukta, does it hv rnas left? Manish: Ok, karmas \n&gt; &gt; projected into=\r\n mind, are acted on and may be experienced by body. So, \n&gt; &gt; why is a jeeva=\r\nnmukta subject to this? because, that person although \n&gt; &gt; aware of the lig=\r\nht at all times, and of the causal n subtle bodies, \n&gt; &gt; has not yet direct=\r\ned d mind to identify as that light at all times, \n&gt; &gt; key word being &quot;all&quot;=\r\n. This gives karmas time to work. Next stage is \n&gt; &gt; 24/7 id with light Nar=\r\nasimha: As per my understanding, the person u r \n&gt; &gt; defining is not a jeev=\r\nanmukta. He may b an elevated being, but not \n&gt; &gt; mukta (liberated) yet. Ma=\r\nnish: I derive that definition of this \n&gt; &gt; &quot;state&quot; from somebody, no probl=\r\nem in disagreement. 24/7 identification \n&gt; &gt; with light, most likely body s=\r\nhould not exist, no? Narasimha: Id with \n&gt; &gt; light forever with body droppi=\r\nng off is just mukti, not jivanmukti! \n&gt; &gt; Jivanmukti is where body stays. =\r\nIs body really different from light? \n&gt; &gt; In fact, is there anything other =\r\nthan light? Jivanmukti is seeing the \n&gt; &gt; play of objects but seeing all as=\r\n light. Mukti & rna are contradictory \n&gt; &gt; concepts & cant coexist. U rnt &quot;=\r\nfree&quot; till u pay back what u owe. And \n&gt; &gt; that means u dont owe anybody an=\r\nything once u r truly free. Words like \n&gt; &gt; free, liberated & jivanmukta r =\r\noften misused. Manish: Will explain a \n&gt; &gt; bit in detail sometime. Narasimh=\r\na: OK. :-) But, as far as &quot;explaining&quot; \n&gt; &gt; is concerned, Vasishtha explain=\r\ned as clearly & elaborately as any \n&gt; &gt; human being can ever hope 2. Manish=\r\n: The question to my mind is this: \n&gt; &gt; was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If s=\r\no, Why did he suffer with throat \n&gt; &gt; cancer if he was not identifying with=\r\n his actions? (according to your \n&gt; &gt; interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definiti=\r\non??) Narasimha: Vasishtha didnt \n&gt; &gt; give a single definition. His entire =\r\ndiscourse 2 Rama is a definition \n&gt; &gt; of jeevanmukta! Will answer ur RK qn =\r\nlater.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
