Yesterd=\r\nay, we had \n&gt; nice discussions on naths, Ramakrishna, Vivekananda etc. Here=\r\n is a small \n&gt; incident Rajarshi mentioned (re-stiched from 4 different &quot;tw=\r\neets&quot; on \n&gt; twitter.com):\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Once during Ramakrishna&#39;s lifetime, there u=\r\nsed to be a preacher who \n&gt; would chant Chaitanya Charitamrita and lecture =\r\non God with such..contd\n&gt; inspiring tone that all his audience would get sw=\r\nept by spiritual \n&gt; emotions. However the preacher lead an immoral life him=\r\nself. So one \n&gt; day..\n&gt; Ramakrishna asked him, why is it that your words ar=\r\ne so powerful and you \n&gt; yourself lead a fallen life? The preacher bowed re=\r\nspectfully to..\n&gt; Ramakrishna and replied, Thakur I am God&#39;s broom! Dirty m=\r\nyself, but help \n&gt; to clear other&#39;s dirt.

I still did not \n&gt; &gt;&gt; understand the concept of moksham. If it is=\r\n a state of being, what is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that state? Is that state defined any wher=\r\ne in Puranas? Who found it \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and being a human why I have to go for it?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I will explain using an analogy.\n&gt; &gt; Once upon a time, there was a=\r\nn ocean. This ocean was vast, still and \n&gt; &gt; blissful. Then a force arose w=\r\nithin the ocean that disturbed it. There \n&gt; &gt; were many waves and ripples o=\r\nn the surface of the ocean. Under the \n&gt; &gt; influence of the force, the ripp=\r\nles and waves started moving rapidly. \n&gt; &gt; Instead of seeing itself as a pa=\r\nrt of the ocean, each ripple thought \n&gt; &gt; it was separate entity. Based on =\r\nother ripples that it hit it nicely \n&gt; &gt; or abruptly, each ripple started l=\r\niking some ripples and hating some \n&gt; &gt; ripples. Based on the previous move=\r\ns, each ripple liked moving in some \n&gt; &gt; ways and hated some moves. The rip=\r\nples developed their own likes, \n&gt; &gt; dislikes, agendas etc. They pushed the=\r\nmselves to move in the way they \n&gt; &gt; liked. When that happened, they were e=\r\nlated. When their move crashed \n&gt; &gt; against the force and they were forced =\r\nto move another way violently, \n&gt; &gt; ripples were depressed. They kept getti=\r\nng elated and depressed, liking \n&gt; &gt; other ripples and hating them, and the=\r\nir likes and agendas kept \n&gt; &gt; evolving.\n&gt; &gt; Some ripples said all the ripp=\r\nles exist within ocean and hence started \n&gt; &gt; worshipping the ocean. Some r=\r\nipples praised the power of the oceanic \n&gt; &gt; force that was responsible for=\r\n all ripples and started worshipping the \n&gt; &gt; force. Some said, &quot;this force=\r\n is not different from ocean. This force \n&gt; &gt; is just a different manifesta=\r\ntion of the ocean. This force and ocean \n&gt; &gt; are one&quot;. Some even went furth=\r\ner and said, &quot;why do I look at myself as \n&gt; &gt; a ripple? I AM the ocean. I a=\r\nm a part of the ocean. I AM the ocean.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; One day, one ripple realized th=\r\nat there was nothing to like or dislike \n&gt; &gt; in any move. There was nothing=\r\n to like or dislike any other ripple. It \n&gt; &gt; realized that it was not a  r=\r\nipple, but it was the ocean itself. All \n&gt; &gt; other ripples it was crashing =\r\nagainst were also it (ocean) only. The \n&gt; &gt; big force of the ocean that was=\r\n moving everything hither tither was \n&gt; &gt; unconfrontable and uncontrollable=\r\n and one needs to just witness what \n&gt; &gt; it does and not try to control it.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; With that realization, the ripple gave up its agendas to move here or =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; there, its likes and dislikes for certain moves, its likes and \n&gt; &gt; di=\r\nslikes for certain ripples, etc. It just remained there on the \n&gt; &gt; surface=\r\n, but looked at itself as the whole ocean and the force moving \n&gt; &gt; it as a=\r\nn uncontrollable force that was moving various parts of it \n&gt; &gt; (ocean). Un=\r\nder the impact of the force, it still kept moving here and \n&gt; &gt; there, hitt=\r\ning this ripple and that ripple, but it stopped resisting \n&gt; &gt; or trying to=\r\n move in a specific way. It moved for some more time and \n&gt; &gt; the ripple di=\r\ned down after a while. It merged in the ocean. Before, it \n&gt; &gt; thought it w=\r\nas ocean and not a ripple, but other ripples could see a \n&gt; &gt; ripple in its=\r\n place. Now that it died down, it was truly ocean and \n&gt; &gt; there was no rip=\r\nple there.\n&gt; &gt; Other ripples kept resisting the force, trying enforce their=\r\n agendas, \n&gt; &gt; and kept moving hither thither and take a new shape when one=\r\n shape was \n&gt; &gt; dying down. They kept revising and pursuing their agendas. =\r\nThe ocean \n&gt; &gt; simply witnessed them and the force kept moving them.\n&gt; &gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt; &gt; In the above analogy, the ocean is known as Shiva or =\r\nPurusha or \n&gt; &gt; Brahman/Aatman. The force within the ocean is known as Shak=\r\nti or \n&gt; &gt; Prakriti or Mahamaya. The waves and ripples are various deities,=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; demons, human beings, animals and other beings. The movement is their=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; thoughts and actions. Moksha is what is described with one ripple at =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; the end (from &quot;One day, one ripples realized..&quot;).\n&gt; &gt; All beings are c=\r\nonstantly revising and pursuing their agendas, with \n&gt; &gt; their own likes/di=\r\nslikes for some actions and likes/dislikes for other \n&gt; &gt; beings. They are =\r\nelated sometimes and depressed sometimes. When one \n&gt; &gt; realizes the uncont=\r\nrollable and unconfrontable nature of the Shakti \n&gt; &gt; that is moving all, o=\r\nne becomes a witness to that Shakti. One may \n&gt; &gt; continue to do things to =\r\nothers and exist in the body, but one does \n&gt; &gt; not resist the agenda of Sh=\r\nakti and submits fully. One does good and \n&gt; &gt; bad things to people without=\r\n like or dislike for people or for \n&gt; &gt; actions. One has no agenda of one&#39;s=\r\n own. One is in constant bliss. \n&gt; &gt; Other people see a body, but one is no=\r\nt identifying with the body. \n&gt; &gt; When the momentum is over, one gives up b=\r\nody and merges in Brahman. \n&gt; &gt; One is not born again.\n&gt; &gt; If you go throug=\r\nh the analogy carefully, a lot of concepts will become \n&gt; &gt; crystal clear -=\r\n Shiva, Shakti, Shiva-Shaktyaikyata (oneness of Shiva \n&gt; &gt; and Shakti), jee=\r\nva, samskaras, jeevanmukti, moksha etc.\n&gt; &gt; Best regards, Narasimha \n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------    Free \n&gt; &gt; Jyoti=\r\nsh Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings, &quot;Do It \n&gt; &gt; Yourself&quot; =\r\nritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana: \n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org &lt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Films that make a differen=\r\nce: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&gt;       Spirit=\r\nuality: \n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;    Jyotish writings: \n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/JyotishWritings \n&gt; &gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWrit=\r\nings&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @homam108 \n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; &gt; On Wed, Jun 29, 2011 at 3:39 PM, raghs wrote:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; I have seen people who talks about moksham.
