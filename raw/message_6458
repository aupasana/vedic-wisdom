Then \n&gt; it is ok t=\r\no dig in several places to become familiar with digging.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though one ma=\r\ny specialize in one subject in higher studies, one learns \n&gt; many subjects =\r\nat a young age. But, eventually you have to focus on one \n&gt; subject. Simila=\r\nrly, worshipping several deities with several mantras is \n&gt; ok in the begin=\r\nning.\n&gt; \n&gt; My thumb rule is this: Leave all mantras and stick to one, if yo=\r\nu feel \n&gt; comfortable with it. If you feel guilty and uncomfortable, then y=\r\nou are \n&gt; probably not ready yet and so keep doing your entire routine. But=\r\n start \n&gt; focusing on one mantra and do more of it, i.e. do others for a sm=\r\nall \n&gt; duration and spend most doing one mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; We do not have perfec=\r\nt enough knowledge of astrology to rely on it. If \n&gt; you go to ten astrolog=\r\ners, you will get 5-8 different advices.\n&gt; \n&gt; Moon and Mars in 6th in taama=\r\nsik Sc can give you victory over enemies \n&gt; (including internal), if you wo=\r\nrshoip Chandi. But lagna lord Mercury is \n&gt; super-strong and shows Vishnu. =\r\nSaturn shows ascetic and Sun shows Rama. \n&gt; So, Sun-Saturn-Mercury combinat=\r\nion to me shows Rama in an ascetic form \n&gt; during vanavas. Worship Rama. De=\r\nvelop the HanumadBhava (think and act \n&gt; like Hanuman) and worship Rama. It=\r\n can make both Mars and Mercury in own \n&gt; houses work strongly in your char=\r\nt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesso=\r\nns, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and=\r\n Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      =\r\n Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituali=\r\nty: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID=\r\n: @homam108\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Jun 2, 2011 at 4:10 PM, priyank_priyank wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;    =\r\n Namaste narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; Does make sense to read 10 strotras for 5-6 dietie=\r\ns daily.
