I read it and reflected \non it, and in my limited understand I a=\r\ngree to most of what you have said. \nSpecially your explanation pertaining =\r\nto=C2=A0Chand-munda and=C2=A0Sumbha-Nishumbh were \nawesome!\n\nI have a quest=\r\nion about your following paragraph:\n\n&lt;&lt;there are those who adhere to the Ta=\r\nntric approach and do the sadhana as per \nthe mantra marga. It is this part=\r\nicular approach that needs initiation as per \nits own principles. Initiatio=\r\nn is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path \nof Viveka and Vichara, =\r\nor the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the \nPauranic approach o=\r\nf reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam \ntoo is not requ=\r\nired if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice \nof Ritual=\r\n/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri \nCh=\r\nandi. However one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditi=\r\nons \nof both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various=\r\n parts of \nthe subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and=\r\n hence the \nimportance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi =\r\nor Sri Vidya.&gt;&gt;\n\n\n1) I had talked to a few people who adhere to different p=\r\naramparas within the \nbroader subset of Kalikula. They said that the initia=\r\ntion in Chandi sadhana in \nrequired for not only the parayana but also (mos=\r\ntly?) because of the main \nmantra. Normally we are accustomed with only the=\r\n navarna mantra, but there are \nvarious other mantras of the different aspe=\r\ncts of the Universal Chandi, of which \nthe navarna we know of, is probably =\r\nthe mildest. To chant one of these mantras \nand awaken the same needs initi=\r\nation. This, they said, is a part of the entire \nChandi sadhana.=C2=A0What=\r\n=C2=A0is your opinion on this?\n\n2) As a corollary to your above paragraph, =\r\none can therefore read the text of \nthe Chandi in a pouranik approach, as a=\r\n sacred myth? There are people, specially \nin Bengal, who do a Chandipath o=\r\nn their own without having undergone any formal \ninitiation. How good or ba=\r\nd is this practise?\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n=C2=A0\n&quot;Between me and You, t=\r\nhere is only me. \nTake away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n\n\n________=\r\n________________________\nFrom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nTo: vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nCc: mindcareclinic@...\nSent: Mon, 18 October=\r\n, 2010 8:54:40 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Fwd: Initiation in mantras (Re: D=\r\nurga Saptashati Inner \nMeaning)\n\n=C2=A0 \nI am forwarding a reply sent by Dr=\r\n Satya Prakash Choudhary.\n\n&gt; Date: Mon, 18 Oct 2010 15:10:31 -0000\n&gt; From: =\r\n&quot;Dr Satya Prakash&quot; &lt;mindcareclinic@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom-owner@yaho=\r\nogroups.com\n&gt; Subject: Initiation in mantras (Re: Durga Saptashati Inner Me=\r\naning)\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; All Glories to the Goddess!\n&gt; \n&gt; I am Sat=\r\nya Prakash, the author of the write-up posted here. Since the last 4-5 \n&gt;ye=\r\nars I have preferred to stay away from internet forums due to various reaso=\r\nns. \n&gt;It has been nearly a year since I interacted on an internet forum. Ho=\r\nwever after \n&gt;Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my =\r\nwrite up to my \n&gt;inbox, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through so=\r\nme posts. I am happy \n&gt;to note that the general atmosphere here is far bett=\r\ner and more sincere than a \n&gt;lot of other forums. Having quickly browsed th=\r\nrough this particular thread, I \n&gt;thought that I might reply to Utpal ji&#39;s =\r\nquestion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question regarding the nece=\r\nssity of \n&gt;initiation. I will address it after summarizing the big picture =\r\nthat needs to be \n&gt;invoked in order to understand the ONE question and the =\r\nMANY answers possible. \n&gt;Firstly is the question a general or specific one?=\r\n Generally speaking if the \n&gt;question is whether initiation is an absolute =\r\nrequirement for spiritual life or \n&gt;sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if=\r\n the question is about the necessity of \n&gt;being initiated for mantra sadhan=\r\na as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is \n&gt;YES.\n&gt; \n&gt; &#39;Munde munde mat=\r\nir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity for \n&gt;multiple =\r\napproaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of \n&gt;multiple =\r\nperspectives. In the pan-Indian context there are many paths for \n&gt;sadhana.=\r\n But in the current context of this question I will restrict myself to \n&gt;on=\r\nly the five that are relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; \n&gt; a. Gnana marga (Advai=\r\ntic/Vedantic)\n&gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric=\r\n)\n&gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path a=\r\nnd/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; \n&gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisa=\r\ntion of the great abstract Truths \n&gt;of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths =\r\nEMPHASISES particular methods and \n&gt;techniques in its attempt to practicali=\r\nse the abstract truths at an experiential \n&gt;level. Let us briefly look at t=\r\nhe predominant methods/ techniques employed by \n&gt;each of these paths.\n&gt; For=\r\n those who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking \n=\r\n&gt;even the external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit fr=\r\nom the \n&gt;wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Adv=\r\naita \n&gt;emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-ref=\r\nlection). \n&gt;Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it=\r\n has retained the \n&gt;vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of t=\r\nexts) too as an important \n&gt;practice. All of these practices involve the &#39;s=\r\nelf&#39; in a big way with a marginal \n&gt;role for external practices.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yoga =\r\nmarga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and \n&gt;Vaira=\r\ngya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally =\r\n\n&gt;emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswar=\r\na) too \n&gt;while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the fir=\r\nst two as they \n&gt;subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devot=\r\nion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s \n&gt;will through total s=\r\nurrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in \n&gt;Karma marga is o=\r\nn Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions \n&gt;without a=\r\nttachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.\n&gt; \n&gt; F=\r\ninally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where alone the \n&gt;=\r\ninevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity of a Guru aris=\r\nes. \n&gt;Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain occult truths=\r\n via the \n&gt;energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It presuppose=\r\ns certain \n&gt;dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby certain regu=\r\nlations and safe \n&gt;practices. It should be remembered that except Bhakti ma=\r\nrga most paths invoke \n&gt;Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti predom=\r\ninantly invokes Soma (the \n&gt;reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam=\r\n&#39;). Among the paths that invoke \n&gt;Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire o=\r\nf the intellect, another the fire of \n&gt;speech, another the fire of austerit=\r\ny, and yet another the physical fire of the \n&gt;Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Tantra=\r\n&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak through the \n&gt;lab-lik=\r\ne practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniques \n=\r\n&gt;that bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhika=\r\nra is \n&gt;not about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a=\r\n child to \n&gt;experiment with fire without any supervision? Does the supervis=\r\nor need \n&gt;experience and training or not? Like any other lab experiment pro=\r\nper training \n&gt;and experience are part of the procedure apart from certain =\r\nsafety measures, in \n&gt;the Tantric lab experiment too. However the lab is on=\r\ne&#39;s own consciousness \n&gt;whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within=\r\n the individual consciousness \n&gt;(also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As t=\r\nhis is not a topic for mere \n&gt;intellectualisation, I will refrain from furt=\r\nher discussion on the Kundalini. \n&gt;Without going into other needless detail=\r\ns here, I will just elaborate on \n&gt;initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sinc=\r\ne we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within \n=\r\n&gt;the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within th=\r\ne \n&gt;Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas =\r\n\n&gt;comprehensively. However there are actually three major schools that are =\r\n\n&gt;full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Sriku=\r\nla and \n&gt;Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vi=\r\ndya sadhana \n&gt;belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete th=\r\ne Vajrayanas among \n&gt;the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who=\r\n are familiar with Tibetan \n&gt;Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 f=\r\norms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana \n&gt;shares both the Advaitic outlook as well=\r\n as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach \n&gt;to sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kali kula *predom=\r\ninantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked at all) \n&gt;while Sri kul=\r\na predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the major milestones in \n&gt;the int=\r\nernal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all \n&gt;co=\r\nnsistently of a particular set of synchronistic frequencies for each of the=\r\nse \n&gt;three lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged entry of the practition=\r\ner into a \n&gt;particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). The Guru para=\r\nmpara can be \n&gt;compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the root f=\r\nrom where the trunk \n&gt;arises. Each branch and sub-branches and twigs spread=\r\n out progressively downward \n&gt;till the individual sadhaka. It is a beautifu=\r\nl metaphor if you can visualise it. \n&gt;Another modern metaphor that one can =\r\nuse is that of electricity. It is held by \n&gt;the Tantric advocate that initi=\r\nation not only completes the circuit necessary \n&gt;for the conduit of electri=\r\ncity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many \n&gt;beautiful bulbs/lights=\r\n at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where \n&gt;there is a long=\r\n series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up \n&gt;till Siva h=\r\nimself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). \n&gt;Now b=\r\nack to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; \n&gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken=\r\n Sakti within the individual \n&gt;consciousness through an integrated approach=\r\n that combines the practices of \n&gt;Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Bo=\r\nth Kalikula and Srikula have evolved \n&gt;into highly comprehensive and integr=\r\nated approaches that can simultaneously hold \n&gt;the many in the One. Sri Sri=\r\n Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. \n&gt;However it is also a=\r\n full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It \n&gt;is also simu=\r\nltaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The \n&gt;question of =\r\ninitiation is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and \n&gt;thus e=\r\nmploying the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as =\r\n\n&gt;a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered =\r\n\n&gt;extensively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Adv=\r\naitic \n&gt;path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful re=\r\nflections \n&gt;through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, the cr=\r\nowning glory in \n&gt;the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself procla=\r\nims in full-fledged \n&gt;Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second,=\r\n saying &quot;I alone exist in \n&gt;this universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (=\r\n10.5). Compare it with the other \n&gt;Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect=\r\n on the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; \n&gt; The reason I advised the non-initiat=\r\ne to read in English or any other regional \n&gt;language is because understand=\r\ning the meaning and constant reflection are \n&gt;possible only when one repeat=\r\nedly reads the text in a language that they can \n&gt;fully follow. The main id=\r\nea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic \n&gt;and Yogic text to=\r\no apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri \n&gt;Chandi is=\r\n also equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially \n&gt;the =\r\nfour hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda=\r\n \n&gt;Samhita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice =\r\nof \n&gt;Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic metho=\r\nd will \n&gt;straightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. I=\r\nn fact even \n&gt;the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based=\r\n on and DERIVED \n&gt;from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the =\r\nHindu temple.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an integral p=\r\nart of Sri Sri Chandi \n&gt;sadhana in accordance with the Vedic approach, ther=\r\ne are those who adhere to the \n&gt;Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per =\r\nthe mantra marga. It is this \n&gt;particular approach that needs initiation as=\r\n per its own principles. Initiation \n&gt;is not mandatory if one adopts the Ve=\r\ndantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the \n&gt;Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vaira=\r\ngya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading the \n&gt;text devoutly as Sacred=\r\n Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not \n&gt;inclined to the p=\r\nredominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit \n&gt;from any o=\r\nr all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear \n&gt;in m=\r\nind that the living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as \n&gt;=\r\nSrikula as practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent origin=\r\nally \n&gt;trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiat=\r\nion for \n&gt;those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; \n&gt; In summary, =\r\none can make spiritual progress through any of the \n&gt;merthods/practices usi=\r\nng Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, \n&gt;Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa,=\r\n Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are \n&gt;all effective. Howev=\r\ner depending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc., \n&gt;some of these =\r\nmethods are more suited relatively to different practitioners. One \n&gt;may pr=\r\nogress through a combination of any of these methods in spiritual life. \n&gt;H=\r\nowever the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA involves Mantra \n=\r\n&gt;diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answer to the questio=\r\nn has \n&gt;to be contextualised.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally one last word. Irrespective of t=\r\nhe method and path, SWADHYAYA and \n&gt;SATSANGHA are the most effective method=\r\ns for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular \n&gt;self-study of texts followed by ref=\r\nlection on the truths expounded in the texts. \n&gt;This is best done in a lang=\r\nuage that one is fully conversant with. As for \n&gt;SATSANGHA it is the FIRST =\r\nAND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the \n&gt;alternate method (tho=\r\nugh not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is \n&gt;Satsangha and=\r\n satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress in \n&gt;spiritual lif=\r\ne. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of \n&gt;serving, =\r\nlistening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and sants in \n&gt;his =\r\nyounger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a quantum leap in=\r\n \n&gt;their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, =\r\n\n&gt;Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n&gt; \n&gt; For those who complain=\r\n about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just \n&gt;quote Swami Sivana=\r\nnda:\n&gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowadays that there a=\r\nre no good \n&gt;Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a qu=\r\nestion of supply \n&gt;and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply wil=\r\nl come at once. This is \n&gt;the inexorable law of nature. If you are really t=\r\nhirsty, you will find your \n&gt;Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-=\r\nlucky life, your mind is full of \n&gt;passion and unholy Vasanas. You do not c=\r\nare a bit for higher divine life. You \n&gt;waste your time in idle gossiping a=\r\nnd vain, worldly talks. You have become a \n&gt;hopeless slave of passion, gree=\r\nd, and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I \n&gt;cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;=\r\n... Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then \n&gt;come to me. I shall ta=\r\nke you to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will put you \n&gt;in the right p=\r\nath, guide you and elevate you to sublime heights. These \n&gt;&quot;oversouls&quot; or h=\r\nigh souls are waiting to get hold of the right type of \n&gt;aspirants. Mahatma=\r\ns are in plenty. Real seekers are few. If you bring a charge, \n&gt;&quot;There are =\r\nno good Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are \n&gt;no re=\r\nal seekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt; \n&gt; To a certain extent even this for=\r\num is an opportunity for Satsangha.

However, one without a rich father is still better off opening a b=\r\nank \n&gt;account with a zero balance and building it up slowly with one&#39;s own =\r\nhard work. \n&gt;Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with fa=\r\nmous mantras and \n&gt;build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a guru to=\r\n initiate you (not as a \n&gt;formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated=\r\n. Otherwise, just go ahead and \n&gt;do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and ritual=\r\ns are used for two purposes - (i) for getting \n&gt;specific material results a=\r\nnd (ii) as tools of increasing surrender and making \n&gt;spiritual progress. I=\r\nn the case of (ii), initiation is not that important. But, \n&gt;in the case of=\r\n (i), there are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently. \n&gt;One can=\r\n get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, th=\r\nere are very few people who can do (i) \n&gt;now-a-days. Nature has destabilize=\r\nd the whole system, for a reason, as Kali \n&gt;progressed. I suggest doing man=\r\ntras and rituals only for increasing surrender, \n&gt;getting whatever material=\r\n results god wants to give and making spiritual \n&gt;progress. If one is meant=\r\n to do rituals for begetting *specific* material \n&gt;results (for oneself or =\r\nothers or society/universe in general), Nature will make \n&gt;arrangements for=\r\n one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. But, as one \n&gt;starts, one sh=\r\nould start with the attitude of (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Cha=\r\nndipath or any mantra or any ritual or any homam, \n&gt;do it with the attitude=\r\n of &quot;I have several material desires, but I do not know \n&gt;how to fulfil the=\r\nm. Because of this ritual, god may give any material results or \n&gt;spiritual=\r\n results and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever \n&gt;go=\r\nd gives. I want to increase my devotion and surrender and make spiritual \n&gt;=\r\nprogress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not required. That attitude its=\r\nelf \n&gt;is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good results sl=\r\nowly, but there are fewer hiccups. \n&gt;Fierce deities give results fast, but =\r\nthere may be some hiccups. I gave this \n&gt;analogy earlier also. Imagine that=\r\n a person is taking rotten fruits from a fruit \n&gt;basket and throwing them i=\r\nn garbage and trying to retrieve one good fruit from \n&gt;under them. If the p=\r\nerson is gentle, one may do it gently and the spillage of \n&gt;rotten fruits o=\r\nn the floor will be minimal. If the person is aggressive, one may \n&gt;do it f=\r\nast and there may be more spillage of rotten fruits on the floor. But the \n=\r\n&gt;good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be retrieved faster. Similar=\r\nly, \n&gt;phala of your karmas is in a basket. The deity is trying to take bad =\r\nfruits and \n&gt;throw them in garbage and give you a good fruit to eat. There =\r\nmay be some \n&gt;spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi ma=\r\ny take more time to \n&gt;get out the good fruit, but the spillage will be mini=\r\nmal. A fierce deity like \n&gt;Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have=\r\n more spillage, but the good \n&gt;fruit comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At the e=\r\nnd, remember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations, but \n&gt;fruits of y=\r\nour own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat each of \n&gt;those r=\r\notten fruits before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one u=\r\nnable to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is \n&gt;better off avoidin=\r\ng fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with gentler \n&gt;deities. If init=\r\niation if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before \n&gt;starting a=\r\n practice. If you realize the above, you can start mantras without \n&gt;initia=\r\ntion. If some bad results occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit of =\r\n\n&gt;your own actions and the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If y=\r\nou are \n&gt;weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some peopl=\r\ne who never lit a lamp in their life and were ignorant of \n&gt;rituals, are do=\r\ning daily homam now. Some people who took several hours to read \n&gt;Saptashat=\r\ni for the first time just 2-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam \n&gt;with =\r\nentire saptashati everyday. I know that some of them have transformed a lot=\r\n \n&gt;and have experienced some things too. Obviously, they have done sadhana =\r\nwith \n&gt;fire and sadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past=\r\n lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank materialism, if s=\r\nomeone has even a \n&gt;faint idea that spiritual progress is important, is loo=\r\nking for god and is \n&gt;attracted to a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandi=\r\npath), that person \n&gt;obviously has some good karmas and good vasanas. That =\r\nperson has done that \n&gt;sadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself =\r\nis one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you have a good understanding of what=\r\n is what, how things work, why \n&gt;one should do something, how to do it, wha=\r\nt is more important and what is less \n&gt;important, that is what initiation i=\r\ns all about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Fr=\r\nee Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals=\r\n for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_=\r\npathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my personal op=\r\ninion that Strong and long standing urge should be \n&gt;considered as Initiati=\r\non at least in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know a person who wanted to recite Chand=\r\ni paatha regularly but was not \n&gt;able to almost for a year.

It is this particular approach that needs init=\r\niation as per its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts=\r\n the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and =\r\nVairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sac=\r\nred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not inclined to the =\r\npredominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or=\r\n all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind=\r\n that the living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Sriku=\r\nla as practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent originally =\r\ntrace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for=\r\n those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.&gt;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;1) I had talked to a few people who adhere to =\r\ndifferent paramparas within the broader subset of Kalikula. They said that =\r\nthe initiation in Chandi sadhana in required for not only the parayana but =\r\nalso (mostly?) because of the main mantra. Normally we are accustomed with =\r\nonly the navarna mantra, but there are various other mantras of the differe=\r\nnt aspects of the Universal Chandi, of which the navarna we know of, is pro=\r\nbably the mildest. To chant one of these mantras and awaken the same needs =\r\ninitiation. This, they said, is a part of the entire Chandi sadhana.&nbsp;W=\r\nhat&nbsp;is your opinion on this?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;2) As a coro=\r\nllary to your above paragraph, one can therefore read the text of the Chand=\r\ni in a pouranik approach, as a sacred myth? There are people, specially in =\r\nBengal, who do a Chandipath on their own without having undergone any forma=\r\nl initiation.

Since the last 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away from int=\r\nernet forums due to various reasons. It has been nearly a year since I inte=\r\nracted on an internet forum. However after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy =\r\nof the original post with my write up\n to my inbox, I visited this forum an=\r\nd quickly browsed through some posts. I am happy to note that the general a=\r\ntmosphere here is far better and more sincere than a lot of other forums. H=\r\naving quickly browsed through this particular thread, I thought that I migh=\r\nt reply to Utpal ji&#39;s question.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal ji has raised an imp=\r\nortant question regarding the necessity of initiation. I will address it af=\r\nter summarizing the big picture that needs to be invoked in order to unders=\r\ntand the ONE question and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the questio=\r\nn a general or specific one? Generally speaking if the question is whether =\r\ninitiation is an absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* a=\r\nnswer is- NO. However if the question is about the necessity of being initi=\r\nated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is YES.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; there=\r\nby the necessity for multiple\n approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises t=\r\nhe inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there =\r\nare many paths for sadhana. But in the current context of this question I w=\r\nill restrict myself to only the five that are relevant to the discussion.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; b. Yoga marga (P=\r\nsycho-spiritual)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; d. Bhakti marga =\r\n(Love/Devotion)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless=\r\n Actions)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisati=\r\non of the great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPH=\r\nASISES particular methods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the=\r\n abstract truths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predo=\r\nminant methods/ techniques employed by each of these paths.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; For tho=\r\nse who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even =\r\nthe external guru is\n not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from th=\r\ne wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita em=\r\nphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection).=\r\n Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it has retain=\r\ned the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too as =\r\nan important practice. All of these practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big w=\r\nay with a marginal role for external practices.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yoga marga=\r\n emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (No=\r\nn-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasi=\r\nse &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too wh=\r\nile Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as t=\r\nhey subscribe to nirishwaravada.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devoti=\r\non) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s will through total surr=\r\nender to the\n Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Ac=\r\ntion as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions without attachm=\r\nent to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where alone =\r\nthe inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity of a Guru =\r\narises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain occult trut=\r\nhs via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It presuppose=\r\ns certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby certain regula=\r\ntions and safe practices. It should be remembered that except Bhakti marga =\r\nmost paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti predominantl=\r\ny invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Amon=\r\ng the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire of the inte=\r\nllect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of austerity, and yet a=\r\nnother\n the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Tantra&#39;=\r\ns method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak through the lab-like p=\r\nractical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniques that=\r\n bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is=\r\n not about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a child =\r\nto experiment with fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor need e=\r\nxperience and training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper trainin=\r\ng and experience are part of the procedure apart from certain safety measur=\r\nes, in the Tantric lab experiment too. However the lab is one&#39;s own conscio=\r\nusness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the individual c=\r\nonsciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a topic =\r\nfor mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from further discussion on the=\r\n Kundalini. Without going into other needless details here, I will just\n el=\r\naborate on initiation and Guru parampara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Since we are tal=\r\nking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Ta=\r\nntric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the Tantric cont=\r\next. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively.=\r\n However there are actually three major schools that are full-fledged livin=\r\ng traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri=\r\n Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to=\r\n Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the B=\r\nuddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan=\r\n Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajra=\r\nyana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its =\r\napproach to sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agn=\r\ni (not that Soma is not invoked at all) while Sri kula\n predominantly invok=\r\nes Soma, at least at the major milestones in the internal spiritual journey=\r\n. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particula=\r\nr set of synchronistic frequencies for each of these three lineages. Initia=\r\ntion is the full-fledged entry of the practitioner into a particular spirit=\r\nual lineage of that path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an I=\r\nNVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Eac=\r\nh branch and sub-branches and twigs spread out progressively downward till =\r\nthe individual sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it.=\r\n Another modern metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is hel=\r\nd by the Tantric advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit ne=\r\ncessary for the conduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Ima=\r\ngine many beautiful bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of liv=\r\ne wires, where there is a long series of\n sadhakas sitting in silent practi=\r\nce all the way up till Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakas=\r\na) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As alrea=\r\ndy stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the individual conscio=\r\nusness through an integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana,=\r\n Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved int=\r\no highly comprehensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously ho=\r\nld the many in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic a=\r\npproach. However it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the =\r\nUpanishads. It is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantr=\r\nasastra. The question of initiation is relevant only to those following the=\r\n Tantramarga and thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those w=\r\nho explore the text as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant =\r\nwhich I have covered extensively\n in my write-up. For those who are already=\r\n inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for imm=\r\nensely powerful reflections through its central message of Oneness. The cre=\r\nst jewel, the crowning glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi =\r\nHerself proclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one witho=\r\nut a second, saying &quot;I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besi=\r\ndes me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and=\r\n reflect on the central truth of Advaita.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The reason I adv=\r\nised the non-initiate to read in English or any other regional language is =\r\nbecause understanding the meaning and constant reflection are possible only=\r\n when one repeatedly reads the text in a language that they can fully follo=\r\nw. The main idea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic and Y=\r\nogic text too apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri=\r\n Chandi is also equally\n regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especi=\r\nally the four hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras or=\r\n the Veda Samhita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the pr=\r\nactice of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Vedic =\r\nmethod will straightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice=\r\n. In fact even the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully base=\r\nd on and DERIVED from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the H=\r\nindu temple.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Just as some practitioners do the Homam as an=\r\n integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the Vedic appro=\r\nach, there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do the sadhana =\r\nas per the mantra marga. It is this particular approach that needs initiati=\r\non as per its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the=\r\n Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vair=\r\nagya, or even the\n Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred=\r\n Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not inclined to the pre=\r\ndominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any or al=\r\nl of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to bear in mind th=\r\nat the living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as well as Srikula =\r\nas practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent originally tra=\r\nce themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of initiation for th=\r\nose paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In summary, =\r\none can make spiritual progress through any of the merthods/practices using=\r\n Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vai=\r\nragya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are all effective. However dep=\r\nending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc., some of these methods =\r\nare more suited relatively to different practitioners. One may progress thr=\r\nough a\n combination of any of these methods in spiritual life. However the =\r\n*full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha too. =\r\nIt is this big picture against which the answer to the question has to be c=\r\nontextualised.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Finally one last word. Irrespective of the =\r\nmethod and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effective methods for=\r\n all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts followed by reflection=\r\n on the truths expounded in the texts. This is best done in a language that=\r\n one is fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST ch=\r\noice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate method (though not as po=\r\nwerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsangha and satsangha alon=\r\ne that enables one to make rapid progress in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishn=\r\na attained the rare exalted state by virtue of serving, listening to and sp=\r\nending time in the company of sadhus and sants in his younger days.\n Viveka=\r\nnanda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a quantum leap in their spiritual liv=\r\nes after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsy=\r\nendranath respectively.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; For those who complain about the s=\r\ncarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote Swami Sivananda:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Q=\r\nUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowadays that there are no go=\r\nod Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a question of =\r\nsupply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will come at on=\r\nce. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really thirsty, you wi=\r\nll find your Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky life, your=\r\n mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit for high=\r\ner divine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping and vain, worldly tal=\r\nks. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, greed, and name and fame. =\r\nAnd yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;... Make\n yourself a des=\r\nerving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall take you to the lotus-feet =\r\nof blessed souls who will put you in the right path, guide you and elevate =\r\nyou to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are waiting to get =\r\nhold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty. Real seekers a=\r\nre few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also =\r\nbring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOT=\r\nE&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To a certain extent even this forum is an opportunity fo=\r\nr Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate bhavana, this group too is a po=\r\ntential Satsangha though not comparable to the actual company of the great =\r\nmasters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Chandi as a yoga-vedantic text alongside a=\r\n study of the lives of great Saktas such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by=\r\n listening and/or singing the uplifting kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, =\r\nby constant remembrance and reflection, by\n discernment of sat and asat, by=\r\n genuine and sincere discussions on a group such as this, one makes progres=\r\ns truly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I may not interact regularly or reply at least fo=\r\nr a while. However I might participate in some discussions on and off.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Satya Prakash&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow y=\r\nmailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Namaste everybody,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I read this message of r=\r\nespected Narasimha Garu few times.

Similarly, a guru =\r\nwith some achievement in a mantra can transfer some of it to a disciple. Ho=\r\nwever, one without a rich\n father is still better off opening a bank accoun=\r\nt with a zero balance and building it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard work. S=\r\nimilarly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous mantras a=\r\nnd build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate you (n=\r\not as a formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just =\r\ngo ahead and do it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and ri=\r\ntuals are used for two purposes - (i) for getting specific material results=\r\n and (ii) as tools of increasing surrender and making spiritual progress. I=\r\nn the case of (ii), initiation is not that important. But, in the case of (=\r\ni), there are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently. One can get=\r\n in trouble otherwise.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I sa=\r\nid several times, there are very few people who can do (i) now-a-days. Natu=\r\nre has destabilized the whole system, for a reason, as Kali progressed. I s=\r\nuggest doing\n mantras and rituals only for increasing surrender, getting wh=\r\natever material results god wants to give and making spiritual progress. If=\r\n one is meant to do rituals for begetting *specific* material results (for =\r\noneself or others or society/universe in general), Nature will make arrange=\r\nments for one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. But, as one starts,=\r\n one should start with the attitude of (ii).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual or any h=\r\nomam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires, but I do=\r\n not know how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give any mate=\r\nrial results or spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires. I =\r\nwill accept whatever god gives. I want to increase my devotion and surrende=\r\nr and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not requir=\r\ned. That attitude itself is an initiation!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt;\n (4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccu=\r\nps. Fierce deities give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. I gave=\r\n this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruits f=\r\nrom a fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrieve one =\r\ngood fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gently a=\r\nnd the spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the perso=\r\nn is aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage of rotte=\r\nn fruits on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits wil=\r\nl be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. The =\r\ndeity is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give you a=\r\n good fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapat=\r\nhi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fruit, but the=\r\n spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or Bhairava or\n Kali =\r\nor Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember that these fruits a=\r\nre not deity&#39;s creations, but fruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, =\r\nyou would&#39;ve had to eat each of those rotten fruits before eating the good =\r\nfruits!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to tak=\r\ne some of the spillage of rotten fruits is better off avoiding fierce deiti=\r\nes such as Chandi and staying with gentler deities. If initiation if made m=\r\nandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before starting a practice. If you =\r\nrealize the above, you can start mantras without initiation. If some bad re=\r\nsults occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit of your own actions and=\r\n the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If you are weak-hearted, s=\r\ntick to gentler deities.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some peopl=\r\ne who never lit a lamp in their life and were ignorant of\n rituals, are doi=\r\nng daily homam now. Some people who took several hours to read Saptashati f=\r\nor the first time just 2-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam with entir=\r\ne saptashati everyday. I know that some of them have transformed a lot and =\r\nhave experienced some things too. Obviously, they have done sadhana with fi=\r\nre and sadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past lives.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank ma=\r\nterialism, if someone has even a faint idea that spiritual progress is impo=\r\nrtant, is looking for god and is attracted to a specific advanced sadhana (=\r\ne.g. Chandipath), that person obviously has some good karmas and good vasan=\r\nas. That person has done that sadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana =\r\nitself is one&#39;s adhikara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you ha=\r\nve a good understanding of what is what, how things work, why one should do=\r\n something, how to do it, what is more important\n and what is less importan=\r\nt, that is what initiation is all about!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Best regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It=\r\n Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofol=\r\nlow&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a =\r\ndifference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dno=\r\nfollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -----=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;\n wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It =\r\nis my personal opinion that Strong and long standing urge should be conside=\r\nred as Initiation at least in this age.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know a per=\r\nson who wanted to recite Chandi paatha regularly but was not able to almost=\r\n for a year.

In this age of\n Kali, She has become the late=\r\nr and she&#39;ll be happy if someone just prays with *slightest* of devotion to=\r\n her by way of recitation of Chandipaatha. this is a strong conviction deve=\r\nloped in me.
