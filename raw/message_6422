At what point did we relinquish=\r\n our understanding of the Eternal Natural Way?  When did we lose our precio=\r\nus connection to Dharma? \n\nWas it when all the ancient sacred temples of th=\r\ne past became the archeological ruins of today?  Was it when the medicinal =\r\narts, consisting of healing herbs and plants, was replaced by the synthetic=\r\n poisons we now call pharmaceuticals?  Was it when animals went from being =\r\nour beloved companions to becoming our tortured food?  Was it when good con=\r\nduct and ethical behavior ceased to be a universal value and became, instea=\r\nd, merely a matter of subjective opinion?  Was it when nature was no longer=\r\n seen as a manifestation of God&#39;s loving abundance, but instead seen as a l=\r\nifeless commodity?  Was it when the gods ceased to be beings whom we could =\r\nspeak with face-to-face, and instead became the subject of &quot;myth&quot;.  Was it =\r\nwhen the bliss of love was replaced by the orgiastic carnival of lust?  Was=\r\n it when works of art stopped being manifestations of beauty and meaning, a=\r\nnd became instead exhibitions of narcissistic psychosis on canvas?  Was it =\r\nwhen we lost the innate human ability to use philosophical discernment and =\r\nreason, and instead began using our amorphous feelings to make important li=\r\nfe decisions?  Was it when we sacrificed natural diversity, hierarchy, soci=\r\nal sophistication, qualitative depth and personhood upon the altar of artif=\r\nicially imposed conformity and radical egalitarianism?  Was it when we aban=\r\ndoned our innate necessity for the expansiveness of freedom and liberty, an=\r\nd submitted instead to the ever-intrusive shackles of the welfare state?  W=\r\nas it when the study of the history of religion eclipsed the impetus to mak=\r\ne religious history?  Was is when we began to worship dog more than we wors=\r\nhip God?  Was it when the uninformed opinions of worthless celebrities beca=\r\nme more authoritative sources of truth for us than the sacred teachings of =\r\nthe liberated sages?  Was it when we merely settled for mediocrity, rather =\r\nthan strove for the very greatest that the cosmos has to offer?  When did R=\r\neality recede from our vision, and reality television take its place? \n\nWe =\r\ncan once again reestablish our cherished connection with Dharma, with a way=\r\n of living that leads to health, joy, abundance, meaning and spiritual fulf=\r\nillment for ourselves and for all sentient beings.  We can heal ourselves a=\r\nnd our Earth by once again relearning and reclaiming the Eternal Natural Wa=\r\ny.  Begin now.\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com/dharmaactivism.php\n\n\nPLEASE FO=\r\nRWARD TO ALL WHO LOVE DHARMA.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
