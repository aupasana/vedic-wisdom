Everyone,\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n I just thought of adding some clarifications.\n&gt;\n&gt; First of all, when I men=\r\ntioned about the utility of techniques of\n&gt; &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life R=\r\negression&quot; for handling the problem of\n&gt; spirit attachments as well as many=\r\n other problems for which we do not have\n&gt; reasonable explanation, my asser=\r\ntions were limited to the utility part only\n&gt; and not beyond that. I have n=\r\no knowledge about whether past life exists or\n&gt; not, in fact I do not have =\r\nany knowledge about anything whatsoever, as I\n&gt; believe, any knowledge with=\r\nout the knowledge of the THAT...The\n&gt; Absolute....is half knowledge or no k=\r\nnowledge in the proper sense of the\n&gt; term. However, in our this empirical =\r\nlife we have to still continue with\n&gt; life irrespective of the fact of havi=\r\nng absolute knowledge or not. Though\n&gt; we know for sure that the Sun does n=\r\not make rounds of the earth but it is\n&gt; the other way around, still we use =\r\nsentences like &quot;Sun rises in the east&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;Sun sets in the west&quot; etc. To ke=\r\nep life going, we keep on continuing with\n&gt; activities which helps in keepi=\r\nng life go on...It is in this sense that I&#39;d\n&gt; mentioned about &quot;Hypnotherap=\r\ny&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; One should not comment about the wealth =\r\ninside a sea just by standing at\n&gt; the shore. Life is full of infinite poss=\r\nibilities. When we say that the God\n&gt; is infinite, we just can not say that=\r\n the universe can behave in any\n&gt; particular limited ways. Before anyone co=\r\nmments about the utility of any\n&gt; branch of knowledge one must first take a=\r\n sincere dip into the same. By\n&gt; saying so, I do not mean to say that if on=\r\ne really takes a sincere dip into\n&gt; any subject one would definitely be con=\r\nvinced about the same. By saying\n&gt; that one shouldn&#39;t make comments before =\r\ntaking a sincere dip, I just mean\n&gt; to say that by doing so one would preve=\r\nnt oneself from being dogmatic,\n&gt; narrow. Not only blind belief in religion=\r\n and religious practices can be\n&gt; termed as dogmatic but also in science if=\r\n one loses the scientific temper.\n&gt;\n&gt; Proof of pudding is in eating it, all=\r\n that I can say to the persons\n&gt; willing to address any of their problems. =\r\n&quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life\n&gt; Regression&quot; have immense utility for those =\r\nwho are desirous of addressing\n&gt; their problems with an open mind. Those wh=\r\no are interested can read &quot; Many\n&gt; Lives, Many Masters by Brian Weiss&quot; to s=\r\ntart with.\n&gt;\n&gt; To respected Narasimha sir, I would like to inform that thes=\r\ne are not &quot;new\n&gt; age ideas&quot;. These were there much before in India. to cite=\r\n concept of\n&gt; &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot; of Jainism is one among them. Jainas used this=\r\n technique of\n&gt; &quot;Jaati Smaran&quot; to reinforce renunciation in the followers.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; To Phil Stinnet, I would like to inform that so far as my knowledge goe=\r\ns\n&gt; Past Life Regression (PLR) can not be done over phone, but however, the=\r\nre\n&gt; are so many problems which can be handled even over phone. To cite one=\r\n\n&gt; example - One girl was having one recurrent bad horrifying dream for pas=\r\nt\n&gt; 4/5 years and she approached me for the treatment. But due to my offici=\r\nal\n&gt; engagements I was camping at a far off place for around 2 months. Her\n=\r\n&gt; problem was getting worsened as it had  started affecting her professiona=\r\nl\n&gt; career adversely. So having left with no choice, I agreed to give her a=\r\n\n&gt; session over phone. The phone session continued for around one and half =\r\nan\n&gt; hour and she got relieved from her that recurrent dream and also start=\r\ned\n&gt; improving her professional life. Since that day the dream has not yet\n=\r\n&gt; visited her again.\n&gt;\n&gt; It all depends on the openness of the mind, the st=\r\nrength of the desire to\n&gt; overcome etc. The universe is much more than what=\r\n we see,what we can see\n&gt; and what we can believe to see.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;   On Saturday, October 26, 2013 3:00 PM, rajarshi nandy &lt;\n&gt; rajarshi14@y=\r\nahoo.co.in&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; To add to the complexity of the proble=\r\nm, I believe our understanding of\n&gt; the reincarnation is over simplified an=\r\nd that causes more problems.\n&gt; Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul w=\r\nill recall those specific\n&gt; moments from past lives when the soul had a rol=\r\ne to play on the external\n&gt; consciousness. Which means if one has lived a l=\r\nife where there never was\n&gt; any opportunity for the soul to come forth and =\r\nshine, in later birth it\n&gt; cannot be recalled. For death is a complete proc=\r\ness. Body, mind, life all\n&gt; get dissolved and new set is generated based on=\r\n need.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Buddhists do not believe in the existence of a soul. They be=\r\nlieve in\n&gt; Shunya - which is similar to our idea of Atmah. Therefore their =\r\nidea of\n&gt; reincarnation is very different. It is like an energy stream made=\r\n up of\n&gt; mind, body that coalesces together to give the impression of an in=\r\ndividual\n&gt; being, which upon death get disintegrated and and spread into th=\r\ne greater\n&gt; flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into another =\r\nformation at\n&gt; a later date, and some other parts can simultaneous or at a =\r\ndifferent point\n&gt; can coalesce into a different part.   Hence it is possibl=\r\ne for a Lama, in\n&gt; their doctrine of reincarnation, to have the some parts =\r\nof his energy\n&gt; reincarnate into one body while another part of his energy =\r\nreincarnate into\n&gt; another body *simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his =\r\nenergy of speech\n&gt; incarnating in one person, while his energy of mind inca=\r\nrnating in another\n&gt; person, or his energy of body incarnating in another p=\r\nerson and all these\n&gt; happening simultaneously! It fits with their philosop=\r\nhy.\n&gt;\n&gt; Those philosophies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation l=\r\nooked\n&gt; at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy governed only by =\r\na\n&gt; supreme law of debts/balances - rna. Hence rnabandhana. Jain scriptures=\r\n are\n&gt; replete with this term. The final aim of all this is to get rid of t=\r\nhe\n&gt; illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. Th=\r\nere\n&gt; is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence the tendency t=\r\nowards\n&gt; strict and formal renunciation of life and its processes.\n&gt;\n&gt; But =\r\nthe old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not\n&gt; disso=\r\nlved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life\n&gt; to=\r\n another and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop\n&gt; t=\r\nhis soul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human\n&gt; min=\r\nd/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual\n&gt; =\r\nand unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth\n&gt; final=\r\nly, be able to *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle\n&gt; and e=\r\nnjoy a Divine Life.  A Supreme Negation of life is not the ultimate\n&gt; aim, =\r\nit is only one among many possibilities.  If  moving into a state of\n&gt; comp=\r\nlete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim, then\n&gt; th=\r\nere was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex\n&gt; life-act=\r\nions. The law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to\n&gt; only an i=\r\ndea of give and take of energy as in the case of the idea of\n&gt; rnabandhana.=\r\n The important thing is whether an action is helping the soul\n&gt; to unfurl a=\r\nnd come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes the\n&gt; karmic equa=\r\ntions immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and\n&gt; real-time =\r\nalgorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed\n&gt; hundred=\r\ns of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not\n&gt; have =\r\nto actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of\n&gt; those =\r\nhe had killed]. Whereas those aspects of life where the soul has no\n&gt; play =\r\nor no scope of play, are firmly governed by the law of rnabandhanas -\n&gt; a m=\r\nechanical give and take of energy.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now since the soul is what remembers=\r\n and everything else being perishable,\n&gt; the only indestructible link betwe=\r\nen past life and present life, it is only\n&gt; the soul-moments which will be =\r\nrecalled, and never a complete cinematic\n&gt; biography recollection. That is =\r\nfantasizing. Now if there have been lives\n&gt; when the soul had little or no =\r\nfrontal role to play at all, then those are\n&gt; dead and gone and buried six =\r\nfeet under with no trace. For Nature, those\n&gt; lives serve no purpose at all=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; Moreover all these are possible ONLY if and when an individual starts=\r\n\n&gt; living in and through the soul in a very very strong manner. That is not=\r\n\n&gt; easy.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *I have a hundred lives before me y=\r\net/ To grasp thee in, O spirit\n&gt; ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insa=\r\ntiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter\n&gt; through them all. -Sri Aurobindo*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n  On Saturday, 26 October 2013 7:38 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

How=\r\never, if such memory does not\n&gt; come at a very young age due to some deep d=\r\nesires from past life or an\n&gt; unnatural death before, it is not easy to get=\r\n it later. Even for a great\n&gt; yogi with tremendous self-control, calming th=\r\ne mind down to suppress\n&gt; current conditioning sufficiently to remember pas=\r\nt life is not easy.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, at least 3 saints/yogis of a high spir=\r\nitual caliber claimed\n&gt; to be re-incarnations of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. I=\r\nf such saints cannot\n&gt; accurately know their own past life, anybody thinkin=\r\ng that someone else can\n&gt; make one aware of one&#39;s past life is just kidding=\r\n oneself.\n&gt;\n&gt; Remembering past life or making someone else do so, is not at=\r\n all easy. In\n&gt; comparison, hallucinating that one remembered past life or =\r\nmaking someone\n&gt; else hallucinate that one remembered past life, is certain=\r\nly very easy! In\n&gt; fact, I suspect that is what happens in most past life r=\r\negressions..\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a deep reason why Nature has built this mechanism=\r\n of forgetting a\n&gt; life when another life starts. Otherwise, this game will=\r\n end very\n&gt; quickly. This forgetfulness prolongs the game very much and mak=\r\nes it far\n&gt; more interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; As=\r\ntrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt; -------=\r\n-\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    *From:* Phil Stinnet &lt;philstinnet@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* &quot;vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; *Sent:* Friday, Octobe=\r\nr 25, 2013 9:16 PM\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: RE: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for p=\r\nrotection from\n&gt; spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Did you get your PLR (Past L=\r\nife Regression)?

I am sure there too one=\r\n can find\n&gt; good exorcists, maybe not of our religion.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have very litt=\r\nle knowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact\n&gt; unfortunately have never =\r\never tried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, there is a =\r\nparticular mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considered\n&gt; to be of excellent=\r\n potency for these kind of problems. This form of\n&gt; Bhairava is a small chi=\r\nld, known as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures\n&gt; He is also referred t=\r\no as the one whose mother is Sahashra Chandika.\n&gt; References to this form c=\r\nan be found in the Rudrayamala, at least some\n&gt; versions of the Rudrayamala=\r\n. This child Bhairava has been invoked for\n&gt; centuries by followers of Shak=\r\nta/Aghor traditions for protection against\n&gt; spirits, and specially during =\r\nrituals of cremation ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; The standard mantra is (there are many var=\r\niations of this mantra too, all\n&gt; are good):\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad U=\r\nddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Generally, at least 10/11 mala=\r\ns of the same should be done in one sitting.\n&gt; And this should be continued=\r\n daily till such time that there is some\n&gt; visible relief. One more thing i=\r\ns that, IF, this is a really genuine\n&gt; instance of spirit possession, as fa=\r\nr as I have seen, it would be quite\n&gt; impossible to rid the problem by any =\r\nexorcist from a distance. These days\n&gt; almost no one has that kind of terri=\r\nfic shakti to cure a case of possession\n&gt; from a distance. Physical presenc=\r\ne in front of the victim is a must for the\n&gt; one trying to help. So close f=\r\namily members, who live with the girl will\n&gt; have to do the sadhana. If you=\r\n go through the Bhairava homam manual by\n&gt; Narasimha, you will find methods=\r\n of doing homas with this mantra. But I\n&gt; guess being in a foreign land hom=\r\nas may not be that easy.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the family visits India, then I have a sugg=\r\nestion. Please ask them, if\n&gt; possible, to visit Kashi and then go to eithe=\r\nr the Kalabhairava or Vatuka\n&gt; Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple spea=\r\nk to the main priest stating\n&gt; the problem. Around these two temples in Kas=\r\nhi, many excellent sadhakas of\n&gt; Bhairava live who are adepts in removing a=\r\nny kind of negative influence.\n&gt; They may charge a certain fee for the ritu=\r\nal and then ask the parents and\n&gt; the girl to come with some specific samag=\r\nris on a specific day/tithi inside\n&gt; the temple and then perform their ritu=\r\nals. Many I know have actually\n&gt; benefited. This is one method. I am sure t=\r\nheir maybe other methods too. I\n&gt; just wrote what came to my mind.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope=\r\n this helps.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *I have a hundred lives bef=\r\nore me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit\n&gt; ethereal, / Be sure I will with he=\r\nart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter\n&gt; through them all. -Sri Aurobindo=\r\n*\n&gt;\n&gt;    *From:* &quot;b_jamnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com\n&gt; *Sent:* Saturday, 10 August 2013 6:36 PM\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at\n&gt; nighttime)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n Namaste.

For there are various classes and ki=\r\nnds and types of entities which\n&gt; can possess an individual and some of the=\r\nm can be downright nasty.\n&gt;\n&gt; Upayas are many. As so many different people =\r\nhave advised, these all\n&gt; sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether a=\r\nny one of them will\n&gt; actually work in a specific case or not depends on mu=\r\nltiple factors.\n&gt; Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all de=\r\npends on what kind\n&gt; of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and=\r\n what their link for\n&gt; the same is. By link it means one has to find out th=\r\ne root, or source of\n&gt; exactly what action allowed them to enter into the p=\r\nerson. Sometimes it can\n&gt; be something as simple as spitting somewhere (whe=\r\nre this being(s) reside),\n&gt; or causally entering into their territory and b=\r\neing susceptible to such\n&gt; possession by certain weakness in the mind and b=\r\nody, or in some cases where\n&gt; such entities are deliberately send to cause =\r\nharm to an individual, ETC\n&gt; ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure =\r\nshot one stop method of\n&gt; removing and handling such a situation. It all de=\r\npends on the shakti of the\n&gt; spirit, and the amount of shakti that those tr=\r\nying to help are able to\n&gt; generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover,=\r\n if the spirit of a violent\n&gt; and extremely malevolent nature, then unless =\r\nthe person trying to remove it\n&gt; is an adept in this, he/she may come to se=\r\nrious harm.\n&gt;\n&gt; These things like removing possession are specializations. =\r\nThese do not\n&gt; fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows wel=\r\nl what one is\n&gt; getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense woul=\r\nd do best to\n&gt; stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must kn=\r\now well how to\n&gt; handle the same too. Again if a spirit is removed by force=\r\n before the time\n&gt; till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to =\r\nbe in possession of\n&gt; the individual, then that too starts a new karmic cha=\r\nin which will involve\n&gt; some not so pleasant consequences for the person wh=\r\no tried to remove the\n&gt; spirit. It is all a complex chain.\n&gt;\n&gt; [Reminds me =\r\nof a particular individual I knew some years ago who was an\n&gt; expert in exo=\r\nrcism. But before starting any exorcism he would ask his\n&gt; Guides to tell h=\r\nim about the spirit as well as the time frame for which the\n&gt; spirit would =\r\nstay in possession as per the previous karmic link between the\n&gt; spirit and=\r\n the victim. Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the\n&gt; spirit =\r\nto leave the body of its own free will, promising good deeds for the\n&gt; spir=\r\nit in return. Never trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would\n&gt; wor=\r\nk. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to\n&gt; =\r\nbe applied.]\n&gt;\n&gt; Best thing to do is a) find someone who knows exactly how =\r\nto deal with\n&gt; spirit possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the=\r\n first is not\n&gt; possible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any =\r\ndeity -\n&gt; preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana=\r\n ETC\n&gt; (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient =\r\nforce\n&gt; and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalis=\r\na may\n&gt; not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone may have to =\r\nspend\n&gt; 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental\n&gt; belief/faith/wil=\r\nl/determination to see this through to the very end. While\n&gt; doing the sadh=\r\nana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either\n&gt; make the posses=\r\nsed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her.\n&gt; And pray as har=\r\nd as possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best of luck and may God help the family.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;=\r\n  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee=\r\n in, O spirit\n&gt; ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue the=\r\ne like a hunter\n&gt; through them all. -Sri Aurobindo*\n&gt;\n&gt;    *From:* Bhupendr=\r\na Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; *Sent:* Saturday, 10 August 2013 8:17 AM\n&gt; *Subjec=\r\nt:* Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at\n&gt; nightti=\r\nme)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you Nithin, I will convey this to the parents.

There\n&gt; were a few more people staying at that place and everybod=\r\ny had severe\n&gt; problems with sleep, so it&#39;s not just me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;On the =\r\nlast night I chanted Sri Rudram at that place before going to\n&gt; sleep and t=\r\nhis was the only night I was able to sleep properly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Upon coming=\r\n back home from that place I started waking up at home,\n&gt; feeling some stro=\r\nng presence - usually some short beings (up to 50 cm in\n&gt; height, I&#39;ve seen=\r\n them before here though); Once the sun rises, all of the\n&gt; strange feeling=\r\ns disappear and I can sleep peacefully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that=\r\n will protect me from all kinds of astral\n&gt; beings at night? Something that=\r\n I can chant before going to sleep. This has\n&gt; been bothering me for some t=\r\nime now and it interferes with my life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Thank you in advance!\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;     \n&gt;\n\r\n--047d7b1632570e715704ea2d1f19\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;I would suggest we follow the procedure which is eternal g=\r\niven by ancestors.

I have no knowledge about whether past life exists or not, in fact =\r\nI do not have any knowledge about anything whatsoever, as I believe, any kn=\r\nowledge without the knowledge of the THAT...The Absolute....is half knowled=\r\nge or no knowledge in the proper sense of the term. However, in our this em=\r\npirical life we have to still continue with life irrespective of the fact o=\r\nf having absolute knowledge or not. Though we know for sure that the Sun do=\r\nes not make rounds of the earth but it is the other way around, still we us=\r\ne sentences like &quot;Sun rises=A0in the east&quot;, &quot;Sun=A0sets=A0in=\r\n the west&quot; etc. To keep life going, we keep on continuing with activit=\r\nies which helps in keeping life go on...It is in this sense that I&#39;d me=\r\nntioned about &quot;Hypnotherapy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot;=\r\n.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;One should not comment=\r\n about the wealth inside a sea just by standing at the shore. Life is full =\r\nof infinite possibilities. When we say that the God is infinite, we just ca=\r\nn not say that the universe can behave in any particular limited ways. Befo=\r\nre anyone comments about the utility of any branch of knowledge one=A0must =\r\nfirst take a sincere dip into the same. By saying so, I do not mean to say =\r\nthat if=A0one really takes a sincere dip into any subject one would definit=\r\nely be convinced about the same.=A0By saying that one shouldn&#39;t make co=\r\nmments before taking a sincere dip, I just mean to say that=A0by doing so o=\r\nne would prevent oneself from being dogmatic, narrow. Not only=A0blind beli=\r\nef in religion and religious practices=A0can be termed as dogmatic but also=\r\n in\n science if one loses the scientific temper.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Proof of pudding is in eating it, all that I can sa=\r\ny to the persons willing to address any of their problems. &quot;Hypnothera=\r\npy&quot; and &quot;Past Life Regression&quot; have immense utility for=A0th=\r\nose who are desirous of addressing their problems with an open mind. Those =\r\nwho are interested can read &quot; Many Lives, Many Masters by Brian Weiss&=\r\nquot; to start with.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;To =\r\nrespected Narasimha sir, I would like to inform that these are not &quot;ne=\r\nw age ideas&quot;.

To cite one example - One girl was=\r\n having=A0one recurrent bad horrifying dream for past 4/5 years and she=A0a=\r\npproached me for the treatment.=A0But due to my=A0official engagements I wa=\r\ns camping at a far off place for around 2 months.=A0Her problem was getting=\r\n worsened as it=A0had=A0 started affecting her professional career adversel=\r\ny. So having left with no choice, I agreed to give her a session over phone=\r\n. The phone session continued for around one and half an hour and she got r=\r\nelieved from her that recurrent dream\n and also started improving her\n prof=\r\nessional life.

Reinc=\r\narnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall those specific moments fr=\r\nom past lives when the soul had a role to play on the external consciousnes=\r\ns. Which means if one has lived a life where there never was any opportunit=\r\ny for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it cannot be recalle=\r\nd. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all get dissolved and =\r\nnew set is generated based on need.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;T=\r\nhe Buddhists do not believe in the existence of a soul. They believe in Shu=\r\nnya - which is similar to our idea of Atmah.\n Therefore\n their idea of rein=\r\ncarnation\n is very different. It is like an energy stream made up of mind, =\r\nbody that coalesces together\n to give the impression of an individual being=\r\n, which upon death get disintegrated and and spread into the greater flow o=\r\nf energy. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into another formation at a lat=\r\ner date, and some other parts can simultaneous or at a different point can =\r\ncoalesce into a different part. =A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama, in the=\r\nir doctrine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of his energy reincarn=\r\nate into one body while another part of his energy reincarnate into another=\r\n body *simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech incarnati=\r\nng in one person, while his energy of mind incarnating in another person, o=\r\nr his energy of body incarnating in another person and all these happening =\r\nsimultaneously! It fits with their philosophy.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br clear=\r\n=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Those philosophies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation=\r\n looked at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy governed only by =\r\na supreme law of\n debts/balances - rna. Hence\n rnabandhana. Jain scriptures=\r\n are replete with this term. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the=\r\n illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There =\r\nis nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence the tendency towards=\r\n strict and formal renunciation of life and its processes.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a =\r\nsoul - that is not dissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried fo=\r\nrward from one life to another and the chief aim of human evolution was to =\r\nassist and develop this soul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabit=\r\ns and uses a human mind/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was t=\r\nhat this individual and unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - i=\r\nn some birth finally, be able to *consciously* operate on an individual hum=\r\nan vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life.=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt; A Supreme Negatio=\r\nn of life is \nnot the ultimate aim, it is only one among many possibilities=\r\n.=A0 If=A0 moving into a state \nof complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is =\r\nthe final and inevitable aim,\n then there was just no need for Avataras to =\r\ndescend and perform complex\n life-actions. &lt;/span&gt;The law of Karma is here =\r\ntoo, but it is not restricted to only an idea of give and take of energy as=\r\n in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an =\r\naction is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it d=\r\noes, then it changes the karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive,=\r\n complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a ban=\r\ndit who must have killed hundreds of people can transform himself into a Ri=\r\nshi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get born a hundred times to get k=\r\nilled in the hands of those he had killed]. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Whereas those aspe=\r\ncts of life \nwhere the soul has no play or no scope of play, are firmly gov=\r\nerned by \nthe law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical give and take of energy. &lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-style:normal;font-size:16px;background-color=\r\n:transparent;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br cl=\r\near=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-style:normal;font-size:16px;b=\r\nackground-color:transparent;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,seri=\r\nf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now since the soul is what remembers and everything else being per=\r\nishable, the only indestructible link between past life and present life, i=\r\nt is only the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never a complete cin=\r\nematic biography recollection. That is fantasizing.
