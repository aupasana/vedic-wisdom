You may call an object made with 22 caret gold to be purer than an o=\r\nbject made with 14 caret gold. But if the arrow, chain and beautiful neckla=\r\nce are all made of 22 caret gold, they are all equally pure. Simply because=\r\n the necklace required more work, it is nore purer.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Similarly, Rama and Krishna were both from Vishnu - pure sattwa. One is=\r\n not more &quot;evolved&quot; than the other.
