They work differently, but\n&gt; both are valid.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, the probl=\r\nem with the former is that most people cannot\n&gt; pronounce it correctly. The=\r\n correct pronunciation is to start saying\n&gt; &quot;hreeng&quot; and stop just when you=\r\n are about to say &quot;g&quot;. The sound &quot;g&quot;\n&gt; should not be explicit at all. To pr=\r\nonounce that nasal &quot;n(g)&quot; correctly,\n&gt; you have to think that you are going=\r\n to say &quot;ng&quot;, but stop just short of\n&gt; &quot;g&quot;. It is not easy. Most people end=\r\n up pronouncing the &quot;g&quot; sound a bit.\n&gt; Instead of making that mistake, it i=\r\ns better to just stick to &quot;hreem&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bottomline: The forms hreem and =\r\nhreen(g) with a silent g are both\n&gt; fine. But hreeng with an explicit g is =\r\na bad idea.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.c=\r\nomcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimha,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Hope you a=\r\nre doing great.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a small question.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Someone said that =\r\n&quot;Hreeing&quot; is more appropriate than &quot;Hreem&quot;.
