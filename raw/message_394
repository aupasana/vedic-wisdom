Especia=\r\nlly when one of the spouses is\n&gt; inclined to brahmacharya and the other is =\r\nequally opposite.\n\nThis is the dilemma faced by a lot of householders. You =\r\nasked specifically about one area of life. I will actually generalize the q=\r\nuestion a bit and answer it.\n\nSuppose you want to engage in what you percei=\r\nve as a good action and someone is throwing obstacles. Should you fight and=\r\n try to engage in the action at any cost or accept the obstacle as a fruit =\r\nof previous karma and move on? This is a very tricky question. Let me give =\r\nmy 2 cents on it.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIt is true that one has to engage i=\r\nn the right actions. However, it is also true that the reactions to previou=\r\ns actions are received constantly and they create various easy and difficul=\r\nt circumstances for current actions. In other words, all our actions take p=\r\nlace in the backdrop of encouraging or discouraging circumstances created b=\r\ny nature as a reaction to our previous actions.\n\nIf somebody is throwing ob=\r\nstacles at you, giving you trouble and stopping you from engaging in what y=\r\nou consider as the right action, it is obviously a payback for previous act=\r\nions. Of course, if the person being used as a medium for this payback by t=\r\nhe nature identifies with that action (of throwing an obstacle at you), it =\r\nbecomes new karma for that person and that person will have to pay for it l=\r\nater. But that is *that person&#39;s* problem and not yours. As far as you are =\r\nconcerned, nature is finding a medium (other person creating problems) and =\r\npaying you back for your past actions via that medium. You should not waste=\r\n time and emotional energy in thoughts like &quot;why is this happening&quot; or &quot;I w=\r\nish this did not happen&quot;.\n\nOne cannot be stuck in the past and should live =\r\nin the present. The only question one should always focus on is: what is th=\r\ne correct action *now*? Past actions are over. Their fruits are not in our =\r\nhands. There is no point in thinking about them. We should only think about=\r\n what to do *now*.\n\n*        *        *\n\nAcceptance of the fruits of previo=\r\nus actions is a must for progress. However, accepting the fruit of a previo=\r\nus action does not mean not fighting it. If the correct action *now* is to =\r\nfight, one should fight. But, even as one fights, one should not be thinkin=\r\ng &quot;why did this happen&quot; or &quot;I hate this&quot; or &quot;why is he doing this to me&quot; or=\r\n &quot;why did I do that before&quot; etc. Emotional investment in such thoughts is a=\r\n waste of time and energy and, more importantly, an unnecessary new karma!!=\r\n Accept that a karma has been committed and a fruit (tasty or rotten) has b=\r\neen given by the nature. Accept it. The only question is: what is the right=\r\n course of action now? Focus on that consciously.\n\nSuppose you are driving =\r\non a one lane road and someone is going very slowly in front of you. You sl=\r\nowed someone down in the past and caused inconvenience. For that karma, nat=\r\nure used a new person as the medium and paid you back. Now, a lot of people=\r\n become frustrated and start cursing the person in front of them. That is u=\r\nseless and new karma. That amounts to not accepting the fruit of a previous=\r\n karma. Instead, think of what to do. Can you take a different turn and cha=\r\nnge the route? Is it worthwhile? If not, is there an area where you can saf=\r\nely and legally overtake the slow car by driving on the other side of the r=\r\noad momentarily? Think along the lines of current action and pick the best =\r\npossible action. If even the best possible action is not good enough, well,=\r\n so be it. Nothing can be done about it.\n\nThus, I am differentiating betwee=\r\nn not accepting the fruits of previous actions and picking correct current =\r\nactions to overcome the trouble caused by the fruits of previous actions. T=\r\nhe former is bad and avoidable. The latter is fine.\n\nIf you are always focu=\r\nssed on the &quot;present&quot; and &quot;current action&quot;, without the unnecessary emotion=\r\nal baggage of &quot;why&quot; and &quot;why not&quot; about the past, you minimize emotional su=\r\nffering and energy dispersion and maximize your efficiency. Thus, this appr=\r\noach makes sense not only spiritually but practically too.\n\n*        *     =\r\n   *\n\nWhile that is good, that is not all. Even one behaving like that will=\r\n incur new karmas. Each current action becomes new karma and gives fruits l=\r\nater. In fact, each action has various repercussions and enables various ot=\r\nher people to engage in various other actions. A part of all those actions =\r\nenabled by one&#39;s action comes to the doer of the original action. Thus, eac=\r\nh new action generates several new karmas. This will result in fruits later=\r\n on, which may encourage or discourage one&#39;s future actions.\n\nHow do we get=\r\n out of this cycle? Well, by performing the action without a sense of owner=\r\nship. However, the fact that we are engaging in an action means there is an=\r\n expected result. We are performing an action because we ideally want a par=\r\nticular result and our judgment says that this action will bring that resul=\r\nt. When we want a result and do an action, how can we let go the sense of o=\r\nwnership over it?\n \nIt is mighty tough. That is why I suggest an intermedia=\r\nte step. When planning an action, think of a goal and plan the action. But,=\r\n once the action is done, you can forget about the goal as well as the acti=\r\non. When an action finishes, surrender ownership over it to the Lord. Think=\r\n that you are now not the owner of the action or its goal or its fruit. It =\r\nbelongs to Lord. Don&#39;t waste any further time thinking and analyzing the ta=\r\nsk. &quot;Oops, I should have done like that&quot;, &quot;Why couldn&#39;t I do it right&quot;, &quot;Wi=\r\nll it work? Will I get it?&quot; etc are useless thoughts. Once the action is ov=\r\ner, there is really nothing you need to do. You should surrender it to the =\r\nLord and move on (to focus on the next action).\n \n*        *        *\n\nI am=\r\n not giving a specific solution to a specific problem here, but outlining t=\r\nhe methodology.\n \nGoing back to your example, suppose your current desired =\r\ngood action is brahmacharya. Suppose the obstacle is that your spouse force=\r\ns you to have sex. This is a fruit of your previous actions. There is no re=\r\nason to hate him or dislike him or harbor ill-feelings for him. That amount=\r\ns to not accepting the fruits of your actions. That does not pertain to the=\r\n question &quot;what should be the current action&quot;. That is more like &quot;why I hat=\r\ne the fruit of my previous action&quot;. That is a useless activity.\n\nInstead se=\r\ne if there is something that can be done. By discussing or even fighting (i=\r\nt is possible to fight without hatred or anger in the heart. Anger and hatr=\r\ned in the heart is non-acceptance of the fruit of previous actions, while t=\r\nhe act of fighting or appearing to fight can merely be the best current act=\r\nion!), do you have a decent chance of convincing? If you think you do, that=\r\n may be the correct current action to undertake. If not, don&#39;t waste time. =\r\nIf you have to anyway go through with something, you just go through with i=\r\nt. When the correct action you want is impossible, you perform whatever act=\r\nion is the best among feasible actions.\n \nAnyway, whichever action you perf=\r\norm - good or bad, you surrender it to Lord in the end! So, it matters only=\r\n for a short while. After that, the action is not yours anyway. If it is an=\r\n action you are performing without interest, you can try to surrender the a=\r\nction to the Lord even as the action is being performed and try to do it wi=\r\nthout attachment and involvement. Of course, the same can done with actions=\r\n you like also, but it is more difficult.\n \nWhether good or bad, if an acti=\r\non is surrendered to the Lord, we form a distance from it. We do not think =\r\ntoo much about it and we do not waste time speculating about what result wi=\r\nll come etc.\n\n*        *        *\n\nBottomline: Two thumb rules: (1) Focus o=\r\nn current action and always ask &quot;what is the *best* thing I can do in the *=\r\ncurrent* circumstances? (2) After doing what you decided do, surrender the =\r\nowenership over that action, its goals and its fruits to God. Do NOT think =\r\nabout that action or its goals or its fruits after that. Think about someth=\r\ning else (like &quot;what should I do NOW&quot;).\n\n*        *        *\n\nActually what=\r\n I wanted to write is not over, but my budget of time is over. So I have to=\r\n stop for tonight. I have been busy at work and working late hours everyday=\r\n and coming home quite late, for the last 2.5 weeks. I was also working ful=\r\nl days in the last 2 weekends. I have been sleeping very little and today I=\r\n want to get a little extra sleep.\n\nWhat I mentioned is karma yoga in a nut=\r\n shell (not the above about work and sleep ;-) but the stuff before it).

W=\r\nhen the children are grown enough to &#39;flow the nest&#39;, a western derivative =\r\nand the primary objective of raising children is over and done with, indulg=\r\nence( over??) soemtimes provokes these thoughts.

This has been a source of argumen=\r\nts and conflicts and I sometimes feel if it is my &#39;duty&#39; to be a part of it=\r\n. It is at times like these that I tend to &#39;surrender&#39; to The Divine Mother=\r\n, the very physical act. I am riddled with doubts if it is alright to do so=\r\n but take solace that She is the Akhilandakoti Brahmandanayika who is overs=\r\neeing the whole world. \n\n  I also feel very closely aligned to the Mother a=\r\nnd constantly &#39;talk&#39; to her for reassurance etc and she has never failed to=\r\n guide me through, albeit through subtle cryptic messages which I cannot sh=\r\nare with my spouse but with my siblings and mother who are all very spiritu=\r\nally inclined.\n  In my recent visit to India, I had an onerous task of ... =\r\nIt was accomplished single-handedly( unseen Grace) and ...

The latter is fine.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;If you are always foc=\r\nussed on the &quot;present&quot; and &quot;current action&quot;, without \nthe unnecessary emoti=\r\nonal baggage of &quot;why&quot; and &quot;why not&quot; about the \npast,&nbsp;you minimize emot=\r\nional suffering and energy dispersion and maximize \nyour efficiency. Thus, =\r\nthis approach makes sense not only spiritually but \npractically too.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While t=\r\nhat is good, that is not all. Even one behaving like that will incur \nnew k=\r\narmas. Each current action becomes new karma and gives fruits later. In \nfa=\r\nct, each action has various repercussions and enables various other people =\r\nto \nengage in various other actions. A part of all those actions enabled by=\r\n one&#39;s \naction comes to the doer of the original action. Thus, each new act=\r\nion generates \nseveral new karmas. This will result in fruits later on, whi=\r\nch may encourage or \ndiscourage one&#39;s future actions.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;How do we get out of this cycle? Well, by performing the action wit=\r\nhout a \nsense of ownership. However, the fact that we are engaging in an ac=\r\ntion means \nthere is an expected result. We are performing an action becaus=\r\ne we ideally want \na particular result and our judgment says that this acti=\r\non will bring that \nresult. When we want a result and do an action, how can=\r\n we let go the sense of \nownership over it?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;It=\r\n is mighty tough. That is why I suggest an intermediate step. When \nplannin=\r\ng an action, think of a goal and plan the action. But, once the action is \n=\r\ndone, you can forget about the goal as well as the action. When an action \n=\r\nfinishes, surrender ownership over it to the Lord. Think that you are now n=\r\not \nthe owner of the action or its goal or its fruit. It belongs to Lord. D=\r\non&#39;t \nwaste any further time thinking and analyzing the task. &quot;Oops, I shou=\r\nld have \ndone like that&quot;, &quot;Why couldn&#39;t I do it right&quot;, &quot;Will it work? Will=\r\n I get it?&quot; \netc are useless thoughts. Once the action is over, there is re=\r\nally nothing you \nneed to do. You should surrender it to the Lord and move =\r\non (to focus on the \nnext action).&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;*&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; *&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I am not giving a specific solution to a =\r\nspecific problem here, but \noutlining the methodology.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Going back to your example, suppose your current desired good acti=\r\non is \nbrahmacharya. Suppose the obstacle is that your spouse forces you to=\r\n have sex. \nThis is a fruit of your previous actions. There is no reason to=\r\n hate him or \ndislike him or harbor ill-feelings for him. That amounts to n=\r\not accepting the \nfruits of your actions. That does not pertain to the ques=\r\ntion &quot;what should be \nthe current action&quot;. That is more like &quot;why I hate th=\r\ne fruit of my previous \naction&quot;. That is a useless activity.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Instead see if there is something that can be done. By discu=\r\nssing or even \nfighting (it is possible to fight without hatred or anger in=\r\n the heart. Anger \nand hatred in the heart is non-acceptance of the fruit o=\r\nf previous actions, \nwhile the act of fighting or appearing to fight can me=\r\nrely be the best current \naction!), do you have a decent chance of convinci=\r\nng? If you think you do, that \nmay be the correct current action to underta=\r\nke. If not, don&#39;t waste time. If you \nhave to anyway go through with someth=\r\ning, you just go through with it. When the \ncorrect action you want is impo=\r\nssible, you perform whatever action is the best \namong feasible actions.&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway, whichever action you perform - good or b=\r\nad, you surrender it to \nLord in the end! So, it matters only for a short w=\r\nhile. After that, the action \nis not yours anyway. If it is an action you a=\r\nre performing without interest, you \ncan try to surrender the action to the=\r\n Lord even as the action is being \nperformed and try to do it without attac=\r\nhment and involvement. Of course, the \nsame can done with actions you like =\r\nalso, but it is more difficult.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Whether good o=\r\nr bad, if an action is surrendered to the Lord, we form a \ndistance from it=\r\n. We do not think too much about it and we do not waste time \nspeculating a=\r\nbout what result will come etc.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n*&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Bottomline: Two thumb rules: (1) Focus on cu=\r\nrrent action and always ask \n&quot;what is the *best* thing I can do in the *cur=\r\nrent* circumstances? (2) After \ndoing what you decided do, surrender the ow=\r\nenership over that action, its goals \nand its fruits to God. Do NOT think a=\r\nbout that action or its goals or its fruits \nafter that. Think about someth=\r\ning else (like &quot;what should I do NOW&quot;).&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;*&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; *&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Actually what I wanted to write is n=\r\not over, but my budget of time is over. \nSo I have to stop for tonight. I h=\r\nave been busy at work and working late hours \neveryday and coming home quit=\r\ne late, for the last 2.5 weeks. I was also working \nfull days in the last 2=\r\n weekends. I have been sleeping very little \nand&nbsp;today I want to get a=\r\n little extra sleep.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;What I mentioned is karma=\r\n yoga in a nut shell (not the above about work and \nsleep ;-) but the stuff=\r\n before it).
