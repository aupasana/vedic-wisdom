A=\r\ngain this world will come, men and women and animals\nwill come, just as the=\r\n mirage came the next day, but not with the same\nforce; along with it will =\r\ncome the idea that I know its nature now, and it\nwill cause no bondage, no =\r\nmore pain, nor grief, nor misery. Whenever\nanything miserable will come, th=\r\ne mind will be able to say, &quot;I know you as\nhallucination.&quot; When a man has r=\r\neached that state, he is called Jivanmukta,\nliving-free&quot;, free even while l=\r\niving. The aim and end in this life for the\nJn=E2na-Yogi is to become this =\r\nJivanmukta, &quot;living-free&quot;.\n\nHe is Jivanmukta who can live in this world wit=\r\nhout being attached.He is\nlike the lotus leaves in water, which are never w=\r\netted by the water.\n\nIf we have known the =C2tman as It is, if we have know=\r\nn that there is nothing\nelse but this Atman, that everything else is but a =\r\ndream, with no existence\nin reality, then this world with its poverties, it=\r\ns miseries, its\nwickedness, and its goodness will cease to disturb us. If t=\r\nhey do not exist,\nfor whom and for what shall we take trouble? This is what=\r\n the Jnana-Yogis\nteach.Therefore, dare to be free, dare to go as far as you=\r\nr thought leads,\nand dare to carry that out in your life. It is very hard t=\r\no come to Jn=E2na. It\nis for the bravest and most daring, who dare to smash=\r\n all idols, not only\nintellectual, but in the senses. This body is not I; i=\r\nt must go. All sorts\nof curious things may come out of this.\n\nA man stands =\r\nup and says, &quot;I am not the body, therefore my headache must be\ncured&quot;; but =\r\nwhere is the headache if not in his body? Let a thousand\nheadaches and a th=\r\nousand bodies come and go. What is that to me? I have\nneither birth nor dea=\r\nth; father or mother I never had; friends and foes I\nhave none, because the=\r\ny are all I. I am my own friend, and I am my own\nenemy. I am Existence-Know=\r\nledge-Bliss Absolute.I am He, I am He. If in a\nthousand bodies I am sufferi=\r\nng from fever and other ills, in millions of\nbodies I am healthy. If in a t=\r\nhousand bodies I am starving, in other\nthousand bodies I am feasting. If in=\r\n thousands of bodies I am suffering\nmisery, in thousands of bodies I am hap=\r\npy. Who shall blame whom, who praise\nwhom? Whom to seek, whom to avoid? I s=\r\neek none, nor avoid any, for I am all\nthe universe. I praise myself, I blam=\r\ne myself, I suffer for myself, I am\nhappy at my own will, I am free. This i=\r\ns the Jn=E2ni, the brave and daring.\nLet the whole universe tumble down; he=\r\n smiles and says it never existed, it\nwas all a hallucination. He sees the =\r\nuniverse tumble down. Where was it!\nWhere has it gone!\n\nIn the vulgar form =\r\nthe question becomes, &quot;How did sin come into this world?&quot;\nThis is the most =\r\nvulgar and sensuous form of the question, and the other is\nthe most philoso=\r\nphic form, but the answer is the same. The same question has\nbeen asked in =\r\nvarious grades and fashions, but in its lower forms it finds\nno solution, b=\r\necause the stories of apples and serpents and women do not\ngive the explana=\r\ntion. In that state, the question is childish, and so is the\nanswer. But th=\r\ne question has assumed very high proportions now: &quot;How did\nthis illusion co=\r\nme?&quot; And the answer is as fine. The answer is that we cannot\nexpect any ans=\r\nwer to an impossible question. The very question is impossible\nin terms. Yo=\r\nu have no right to ask that question. Why? What is perfection?\nThat which i=\r\ns beyond time, space, and causation =97 that is perfect.\n\nThen you ask how =\r\nthe perfect became imperfect. In logical language the\nquestion may be put i=\r\nn this form: &quot;How did that which is beyond causation\nbecome caused?&quot; You co=\r\nntradict yourself. You first admit it is beyond\ncausation, and then ask wha=\r\nt causes it. This question can only be asked\nwithin the limits of causation=\r\n. As far as time and space and causation\nextend, so far can this question b=\r\ne asked. But beyond that it will be\nnonsense to ask it, because the questio=\r\nn is illogical. Within time, space,\nand causation it can never be answered,=\r\n and what answer may lie beyond these\nlimits can only be known when we have=\r\n transcended them;therefore the wise\nwill let this question rest. When a ma=\r\nn is ill, he devotes himself to curing\nhis disease without insisting that h=\r\ne must first learn how he came to have\nit.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikisource.or=\r\ng/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_3/Lectures_and_Discou=\r\nrses/The_Free_Soul\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n=\r\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--00c09ffb56b93782470471ddc86c\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-fami=\r\nly: Verdana; &quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;post-body entry-content&quot; style=3D&quot;margin-top: =\r\n0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-heigh=\r\nt: 1.3em; &quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;THE FREE SOUL (Delivered i=\r\nn New York, 1896)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;Philoso=\r\nphy is no joke or talk.
