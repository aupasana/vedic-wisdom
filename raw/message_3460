You, I, all these people are pie=\r\nces in another kind of chess game. \n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Great analogy. Manish had g=\r\niven this analogy to us after he=A0completed a beautiful=A0Ganapati homa la=\r\nst August. There is=A0one divine chess player, and it is totally His game. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Before I continue with the narration, I would like to mention =\r\na few points which I found I had not clearly mentioned in my last mail:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n =A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the end of the third day of Chandi homa at Manikarnika sam=\r\nshan, we were standing and watching the pyres burn, when Manish suddenly sa=\r\nid, in the coming days you will write about this experience in a public for=\r\num. Therefore my mails.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Caveat: A homa on a funeral pyre i=\r\ns an extreme Aghor=A0sadhana, and it is not entirely risk free. Infact, in =\r\nmany paramparas it is said=A0only someone who has a direct agya from Samsha=\r\nn Kali or Mahakala can try this procedure, or someone who has agya from a p=\r\nowerful Guru. It was Manish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis)=A0I was=\r\n only doing the Chandi Path. Therefore, by reading this accounts one should=\r\n not, on his own, try out this sadhana. \n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many people have =\r\na negative=A0bias towards Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due to =\r\nlack of knowledge or understanding of the philosophy and efficacy of these =\r\nsadhanas. Moreover, in recent time some TV channels too have made films etc=\r\n of Aghoris, potraying them as perverted individuals. This is grossly incor=\r\nrect. They have no clue what they are talking about, and their accounts sta=\r\nrt with many preconcieved biases. Aghora is one of the many path to the rea=\r\nch the same goals - Self-realization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a p=\r\nath. Some like it, some don&#39;t. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen path =\r\nbut at the same time have a healthy respect for other paths too. Many great=\r\n saints and spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is consi=\r\ndered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Sw=\r\nami was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master Aghori. My mails are intende=\r\nd to give a first hand objective=A0account of how a\n&gt; &gt;  powerful sadhana i=\r\nn the samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just the cronicler.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are many people in this age who have a desire for these sadh=\r\nanas, who feel an attraction for this kind of a path, but have no clue how =\r\nto go about it. These accounts are ment to tell such=A0people that these sa=\r\ndhanas can and do happen even today, it is not a figment of imagination. Th=\r\ne Manikarnika is still as powerful as it was thousands of years ago. But to=\r\n go about it and=A0actually be able to do this sadhana, just like everythin=\r\ng else in life, there is no fixed procedures or rules. Keep doing sadhana i=\r\nn whatever condition you are in right now=A0and let Nature decide. Like Sai=\r\n Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and patience. If the desire is genu=\r\nine and deep, and one is ready to wait, Nature will one day make arrangemen=\r\nts. This is the eternal promise to every individual=A0because for Her, NOTH=\r\nING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so=A0kind.=A0 In the intruduction to &quot;Aghora =\r\n- At the left hand of God&quot;, Vimalanada says :\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Publish this b=\r\nook after I am gone. Let people know the truth. Let them know what is what.=\r\n Out of the thousands who may read it at least a few will be sincere. They =\r\nwill try to learn more, and then Nature Herself will make arrangements for =\r\nthem to learn just as She did for me, and they will be taught according to =\r\ntheir capabilities. The progression will go on; there is nothing to fear&quot;.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Therefore have faith, do sadhana.=A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Back to the narr=\r\nation. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Manish said it is=\r\n a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are available on this nig=\r\nht which can destroy Ashuras.=A0Past midnight we were walking towards Manik=\r\narnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be seen anywhere on any =\r\nof the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found a pack of dog=\r\ns, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stopped, wondering if t=\r\nhere was any alternate route to the samshan. I started mentally chanting a =\r\nmantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journey smooth. Coincide=\r\nntally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the other side who cha=\r\nsed the dogs away.=A0Without looking at me=A0Manish said, &quot;Sometimes a simp=\r\nle prayer can work wonders but never become to big for your breeches&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this is a wonderful place.=\r\n=A0I did not think too much about it then since my mind was already pre occ=\r\nupied with the thoughts of what is to come. The next day morning when we ag=\r\nain came to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting, I suddenly felt a pressure o=\r\nn my head, and then everything became calm. Manish smiled at me and said th=\r\nis is where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya and the energies are still here=\r\n. I was little skeptical mentally, since I knew that the samadhi of Trilang=\r\na Swami was at a different ghat, however I did not say anything.=A0Later on=\r\n returning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who was from Beneras and that perso=\r\nn confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and =\r\ndo his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed idiot.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Back to mid=\r\nnight. We reached Manikarnika and again it was filled with people. But this=\r\n time we did not wait. We went right inside, and Manish kept looking for a =\r\nsuitable chita. As we came in, again people started staring at us, but they=\r\n respectfully made way for us to pass through to the middle of the samshan.=\r\n We stood exactly at the middle, with Manish observing the different chitas=\r\n. There were about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in thousands of years t=\r\nhere has not been a single minute when there has not been a body burning in=\r\n here. Therefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in India. There was one chit=\r\na to my right which Manish was observing, when suddenly I found a mega size=\r\n bull come and stand right next to the fire. I did not want to sit there, t=\r\nhe bull looked dangerous. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said let =\r\nus go to the other side of the samshan. It not only the bull,=A0 but there =\r\nis something else as well. I did not ask him what. So we\n&gt; &gt;  went to anoth=\r\ner side. The dom there came forward and said to Manish, &quot;Baba,aap log=A0kau=\r\nn se chita me baithna chahate ho?&quot;. Manish indicated one at the end, the do=\r\nme then went ahead and asked the people standing around the chita to make s=\r\npace for us to sit. He said the heat from the fire is too stong, but Manish=\r\n said it&#39;s ok, we&#39;ll sit here itself. There were many curious onlookers, bu=\r\nt all made space for us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instructin=\r\ng others not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something very=\r\n unique about Manikarnika. IN any other city, people would have objected, b=\r\nut not here. Manish later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadh=\r\nanas have been done in here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes ha=\r\nve either themsleves seen these things or heard from their families and thu=\r\ns they do not disturb. \n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; The homa, as usual was awesome. The pyr=\r\ne was larger than the one previous night. The heat was very strong. My focu=\r\ns was stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. Within ten=\r\n minutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This was stran=\r\nge because=A0there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose t=\r\nhis specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler sen=\r\nse perception than average humans like me. This homa was extended longer. E=\r\nvery now and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direction intentl=\r\ny for a few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw nothing. But=\r\n, everytime Manish looked at a specific direction or made some gestures, th=\r\ne dogs too would start barking at that direction. At one point I almost fel=\r\nt a bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which I=A0 - being=\r\n such an=A0ordinary person -=A0obviously had no clue about. In the middle o=\r\nf the Chandi path=A0I could hear\n&gt; &gt;  chants of &quot;Ram Nam Satya Hai&quot; and rel=\r\natives wailing as new bodies were being brought in. \n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Suddenly t=\r\no my right there was a sound and quite abit of smoke, I saw a transformer b=\r\nursting. The dogs immediately started barking at that. Later Manish said th=\r\ne Goddess was moving around, entering the fire and leaving the fire. The bu=\r\nrsting of the transformer had a link to this. As the Path was going on - th=\r\ne Chandi was in my right hand - I saw a human shadow pass over=A0the pages =\r\nof the=A0book. I thought it was some relative who was standing behind me.=\r\n=A0I looked back and was a shocked to find there was no one behind me. And =\r\nthe shadow passed over my book once again. This time I did not look back. J=\r\nust kept chanting with more vigor and saying to myself &quot;all iz well&quot;-:).=A0=\r\n Manish later said, as one does sadhana the deity often comes to observe an=\r\nd make his/her presence felt, even if slightly.=A0It is not an imagination =\r\nbut reality and this can=A0happen not just in a samshan but in any sadhana =\r\nanywhere. The idea is to keep doing sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; While offering coc=\r\nonuts into the fire, one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long=\r\n bamboo stick which the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut=\r\n piece inside.I wondered if I=A0had been a dom in any of my past lives, bec=\r\nause I strangely felt natural stroking the pyre=A0the way the domes do. I e=\r\nven wondered if=A0there was any company which would may me for this kind of=\r\n a job, I would happily take it. What better way to do sadhana than become =\r\na dom at Manikarkina!=A0Interestingly, I then remembered that Manish had bo=\r\nught one extra coconut while buying the samagri to tonight&#39;s homas. Now I u=\r\nnderstood why.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; In the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish calle=\r\nd one of the relatives who was standing nearby and told him=A0that the pers=\r\non whos body was in the pyre has just left and that=A0they (relatives) do n=\r\not have to wait any more. It was already late in the night. The person did =\r\nnot know what to say. Suddenly Manish explained to him, do not worry, there=\r\n is nothing evil or bad being done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I=\r\n guess the person was mentally wondering about what is going on. Then anoth=\r\ner of the relatives came forward and said, &quot;Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi =\r\njayenge&quot;. So Manish said ok and asked them to sit down and continued with t=\r\nhe homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish asked me to observe the =\r\nskin on the corpse=A0 I saw the skin on the face had caught fire and was bu=\r\nrning. It was a sight to see!\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; There is a tradition of pouring G=\r\nanges water=A0at the end to finsh the fire. But I could hear the domes tell=\r\ning the relatives not to pour water on the pyre or do anything there withou=\r\nt permissin from Manish. Finally at the end they came to Manish and=A0asked=\r\n if they could pour some Ganges water. Manish said ok, but in a low voice t=\r\nold me nothing will happen to the fire, it won&#39;t die. They poured a large m=\r\nud kalash full of water but nothing happened to the fire. It kept burning. =\r\nAfter some times, after some more ahutis, Manish called the people and said=\r\n, &quot; Devi=A0samne khadi hai. App log pranam kijiye&quot;. At least 10/15 people c=\r\name forward and reventially bowed to the fire. Then they wanted to touch=A0=\r\nManish&#39;s feet, but Manish would not let them do so. They asked for his bles=\r\nsings. He distributed some flower petals we had and told them to go home, s=\r\nince it was very late in the night. Suddenly the man, who had some doubts (=\r\nwhom Manish had addressed earlier) came\n&gt; &gt;  running with tears in his eyes=\r\n asking for forgiveness for having doubted. Manish consoled him, told him n=\r\nothing to worry, he has done no wrong, everything is all right.=A0 Later Ma=\r\nnish said, if it was some other time of the day he would have brought the m=\r\nan along for a cup of tea. Another person suddenly came to Manish and asked=\r\n him if he was a certain saint (a famous saint)=A0who used to live in Kasi.=\r\n Manish without responding to his query asked him where was he from, the pe=\r\nrson replied interior=A0Bihar. Manish advised him to go back home as it was=\r\n late in the night. The faith of the ordinary people of this land is what m=\r\nakes India so unique, that is why our land and culture is still so alive. W=\r\ne city bred &#39;educated&#39;=A0people are too rational to understand these things=\r\n. God loves the simple and uncalculating. By this time I too stood up to do=\r\n pranam to the fire. Immediately I felt as if my body existed only from my =\r\nhead to my heart, there was nothing\n&gt; &gt;  below, no legs, no stomach ,=A0as =\r\nif=A0I was simply floating on thin=A0air! I told Manish what happened, he j=\r\nust gave a=A0curt one word reply, &quot;Good&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; As we=\r\n were walking back from Manikarnika Manish suddenly said, &quot;There is a forei=\r\ngner lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who has a lot of desire to perfor=\r\nm sadhanas in the samshan but does not know how to go about it. I saw her w=\r\nhile meditating.&quot; For a woman to come and perform these sadhanas is practic=\r\nally difficult or impossible, unless she is a Yogini or a sadhaka of great =\r\ncalibre. Ordinary people would not be able to meet the gaze of a Yogini, sa=\r\nid Manish. The next morning, when we came to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentione=\r\nd above), I saw a thin, frail, looking foreigner lady sitting on the banks.=\r\n Manish quitely indicated to me that, that is the lady whom he had seen las=\r\nt night in his meditation at the samshan. &quot;She has desire, but directionles=\r\ns.&quot; At that time there was nothing more we could do. I guess that is why it=\r\n is so important to keep doing some sadhana on your own, instead of merely =\r\ncontemplating which is of no good,=A0so that you are ready when\n&gt; &gt;  Nature=\r\n decides to give you a push. \n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; After passing the Lalita Ghat, ne=\r\nxt afternoon,=A0we stood and observed Manikarnika from a distance. We were =\r\ndressed like any other tourist, specially with Manish&#39;s camera hanging from=\r\n his neck=A0and the=A0tripod. Manish smiled and said let us not go too clos=\r\ne to Manikarnika, what if the doms recognize us! They would be shell shocke=\r\nd seeing us dressed as tourists, wondering what is going on.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\nus ended my second day of observing a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre at the =\r\nfamed Manikarnika Ghats of Kashi.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; =A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rama Naam Satya Hai\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       The INTERN=\r\nET now has a personality.
