I suggest some what si=\r\nmilar line of thinking.\n\nIt is quite possible that you are living out, in d=\r\nreams, Unpleasant effects of some bad past Karmas. It actually may be bette=\r\nr as its happening in the dream and hopefully not in actual life.\n\nI too ha=\r\nve had gone through similar situation some time back. What i did was not to=\r\n discuss with anybody and just forgot those dreams. Fortunately it was quit=\r\ne easy for me to forget those bad dreams i had. Best would be to pray and p=\r\nut your case in front of Homa Agni and the invoked deity. Dreams ki hi aahu=\r\nti de do! Bhsma ho jayenge!\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal \n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr. A.

Although i am not able enough to =\r\nanswer your query. but I want to remind you story of Churning of ocean. Ple=\r\nase remember that I may be wrong so please ignore if you think so.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whe=\r\nn ocean was churned, by devas and devatas, by placing Meru parvat on back o=\r\nf Kurmavtar. First thing which came out was &#39;halahal&#39;. The poison.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thi=\r\ns terrified both Gods and demons, halahal was so toxicating that the whole =\r\nworld began trembling. Then Lord Shiva came to rescue and because of compas=\r\nsion Lord Shiva swallowed the poison. Although the poison was stuck, no whe=\r\nre to go. So it didnt harmed either Shiva or Srishti.\n&gt; \n&gt; After that other=\r\n ratnas and ultimately amrita came out.\n&gt; \n&gt; IMHO, same is happening to you=\r\n. You need to request to Lord Shiva to swallow this poison so that your sri=\r\nshti is spared. As you know, Lord shiva rules tamas guna, and meditates on =\r\nkailash parvat, coldest place. He is sitting with his eyes closed. \n&gt; \n&gt; Yo=\r\nu also need to do the same. Swallow this poison. neither let it enter your =\r\nstomach nor let it come out. Simply close your eyes and be cool. Means acce=\r\npt this poison, and also accept it that this is reality. You can not change=\r\n it. Bad things happen to every one. After you accept, you need to ignore i=\r\nt. close your eyes toward these. if you do not swallow and ignore this pois=\r\non, this poison may harm and derail you from your sadhna.\n&gt; \n&gt; After Shiva =\r\nswallowed posion, he felt extreme burning sensation. you may also feel the =\r\nsame. that burning sensation was relieved by drinking milk. Milk signifies =\r\nlove and knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; I may have committed many mistakes in this message=\r\n. please pardon me for mistakes. i hope senior and able members will rectif=\r\ny my mistakes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kind Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, =\r\nPriya M &lt;prm7782@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Many thanks for your response.
