Actually one more invitation for same Damodar Pujan=\r\n (by an ISCKON devotee) came to me 3 days back from one more friend. but i =\r\nwanted to do Homam and hence i turned down several times and did not go the=\r\nre.\n\nI turned down the 2nd invitation came from another friend yesterday. b=\r\nut today he and his wife called me again and their insistence was so much t=\r\nhat i finally gave in. actually i thought that Damodar Krishna himself is c=\r\nalling so many times then if i don&#39;t go then its like rejecting the call of=\r\n Baby Krishna (pl. dont laugh and take me wrong here- i actually thought th=\r\nat way).\n\nBUT it is a good lesson. Not that I start hating them or somethin=\r\ng like that. actually Homam and My Guru&#39;s influence has almost removed feel=\r\ning of Hatred from my heart but Yes I&#39;ve decided now that whenever any ISCK=\r\nON devotee or anybody in future gives such speech and i am present there I&#39;=\r\nll not keep quite. I&#39;ll engage him/her in arguments and at least try to cre=\r\nate sufficient doubt in his/her heart for their belief system injected by I=\r\nSCKON. I&#39;ll try to create doubt for his/her fanaticism and I think that is =\r\nwhy Lord Krishna pulled me there. Every incident has a meaning.\n\n***\n\nI als=\r\no request friends to remove feeling of hatred or even anger for such people=\r\n/organisation/concepts. Yes but surely try to tear-apart such belief system=\r\n of Fanatiscism whenever get in to such situation. even if a Single person =\r\nis turned away from such wrong thoughts, will be beneficial for many. But i=\r\nt is also very good to appreciate a genuinely devoted Krishna Bahkta from I=\r\nSKCON to do more and more Bhakti for beloved Krishna while always standing =\r\nup against their attitude towards other Gods.\n\n***\n\nSome times such discuss=\r\nions are necessary and they are out of spontenity and not by design. Truth =\r\nsometimes creates uncomfortable situations and many sparks comes out in suc=\r\nh threads occasionaly which may make a group look like an aggressive and in=\r\ntolerable etc...but that doesn&#39;t matter. on the contrary i take it as a hea=\r\nlthy sign. The Truth must be told sometimes frankly and who knows what purp=\r\nose it may serve in future.\n\n***\nI sincerely wish that one day differences =\r\nof Vaishnava & Shaivaite, Brahmins and Non-Brahmins etc... are completely g=\r\none from Vedic Dharma.\n***\nI wish to conclude here. I have got my light on =\r\nthe subject and  would not write anything else in this thread now.\n\nBest Re=\r\ngards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n\n\nThe goal should not be to just speak truth. The goal sho=\r\nuld be to speak truth\n*purposefully*.\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm, Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree wit=\r\nh all your sentiments but what could be done about these people?

Shiva and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Vishnu had unconditional love an=\r\nd devotion for each other. They are not like \n&gt; &gt;&gt;normal human beings and t=\r\nheir relationships, such as love and devotion, are not \n&gt; &gt;&gt;governed by pet=\r\nty notions of superiority and dependence.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; The Shaivite-Vaishnavi=\r\nte distinctions and the biases of Kali yuga are \n&gt; &gt;&gt;unfortunate. Neverthel=\r\ness, I am willing to tolerate biases and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;closed-mindedness. Closed-min=\r\ndedness is ok as long as one is making some \n&gt; &gt;&gt;progress with one&#39;s own be=\r\nlief system.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; One climbing a mountain has to cho=\r\nose one of the available paths. Whether one \n&gt; &gt;&gt;acknowledges that several =\r\nmountain paths lead to the mountain top or whether one \n&gt; &gt;&gt;believes that o=\r\nnly the path one has chosen leads to the top, is not that \n&gt; &gt;&gt;important. A=\r\ns long as one is climbing the mountain in one&#39;s chosen path, one is \n&gt; &gt;&gt;do=\r\ning alright!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; After all, there may be many paths around the hill.=\r\n One may be unable to see \n&gt; &gt;&gt;paths on the other side of the mountain or e=\r\nven distant paths on the same side. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;If one does not think much of thos=\r\ne paths and focuses on climbing in one&#39;s own \n&gt; &gt;&gt;path, that does no harm.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; As one reaches the top, it gets narrower and one may see the oth=\r\ner paths that \n&gt; &gt;&gt;seemed quite distant earlier to be quite nearby now. As =\r\none is very close to the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;top, one will see that all paths are leading =\r\nthere. When one is on the top, one \n&gt; &gt;&gt;sees all paths to converge there. A=\r\nfter god-realization, one sees various paths \n&gt; &gt;&gt;to be valid paths to god.=\r\n Of course, different paths come with different \n&gt; &gt;&gt;obstacles. One path ma=\r\ny have some snow. One path may be too steep. One path may \n&gt; &gt;&gt;be slippery.=\r\n One path may have falling rocks. One path may have fallen trees \n&gt; &gt;&gt;block=\r\ning it. And so on. But, one on the top knows that people can reach there \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;using several paths, if they are committed to overcoming the obstacles a=\r\nnd \n&gt; &gt;&gt;reaching the top.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Let people follow the paths chosen by =\r\nthem and wish them good luck to reach the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;top in their own paths. Let =\r\nthem say whatever they want to say about your path. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;It does not matter=\r\n. If YOU have conviction and faith, you just walk your path \n&gt; &gt;&gt;and reach =\r\nthe top!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; The problem is that some people are do=\r\ning no sadhana really, making no progress \n&gt; &gt;&gt;really and yet passing judgm=\r\nents on other paths and getting into fights. They \n&gt; &gt;&gt;are like people at t=\r\nhe base of the mountain, trying to block people from some \n&gt; &gt;&gt;paths and tr=\r\nying to enroll them in their path. They may fight with people and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;kill=\r\n them too. They stay at the base forever and never reach the top. They are =\r\na \n&gt; &gt;&gt;problem.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; But, people with narrow views who do some sadhan=\r\na and make progress are ok. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;They are on some path and will eventually =\r\nreach god. For example, so many \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Krishna bhaktas who look down upon Shi=\r\nva as a lower demigod may be doing their \n&gt; &gt;&gt;mantra several malas a day wi=\r\nth a good level of devotion and they will \n&gt; &gt;&gt;eventually make progress. I =\r\nknow Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do not even \n&gt; &gt;&gt;worship Ganesha as=\r\n he is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family&quot; and worship Vishvaksena at the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;start of t=\r\nheir poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm to anyone, try to \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;see all human beings as Vishnu&#39;s forms, try to serve all and keep their \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;austerities. Bottomline is that they are doing some sadhana and will eve=\r\nntually \n&gt; &gt;&gt;make progress.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Let us not worry about people who ar=\r\ne doing some sadhana and progressing. Any \n&gt; &gt;&gt;deficiencies in their unders=\r\ntanding will be addressed in due course.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; The bottomline is: Keep=\r\n doing enough sadhana to burn the conditioning and keep \n&gt; &gt;&gt;making progres=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Le=\r\nssons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Hom=\r\nam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Films that m=\r\nake a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I hardly disagree with your views but for Iskco=\r\nn I have my own thoughts,no \n&gt; &gt;&gt;doubt on Shri Prabhupada and his mission t=\r\no spread Shri Krishna&#39;s awareness but \n&gt; &gt;&gt;many times(After exit of Shri Pr=\r\nabhupada)on numerous occasions I found their \n&gt; &gt;&gt;views very biased towards=\r\n Shri Shivji and for that reason I have my reservations \n&gt; &gt;&gt;and those view=\r\ns of mine are not my own views as some senior ex-Iskconites too \n&gt; &gt;&gt;share =\r\nsame views like me.If I am allowed to speak I have seen very few shivites \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;speaking hard stuff like them for opposite side.(Shri Hari or Shri Kris=\r\nhna),not \n&gt; &gt;&gt;even that well known astrologer Sanjay Rath once posted a sep=\r\narate procedures \n&gt; &gt;&gt;for Vaishnavas to do Mahamrityunjaya japam using Shri=\r\n Veda Vyasa&#39;s name instead \n&gt; &gt;&gt;of Shri Vasishtha mantra(Vam Vasishthaya Na=\r\nmah) !

If you see an elepha=\r\nnt yourself \n&gt; &gt;&gt;oneday, you will realize then that books that seemed contr=\r\nadictory once are not \n&gt; &gt;&gt;that contradictory after all.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sri=\r\nla Prabhupada was undoubtedly a great saint. To go abroad without even \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;knowing anyone there at an advanced age to spread Krishna bhakti, to roam =\r\nNew \n&gt; &gt;&gt;York streets without proper shoes or clothing in winter, requires =\r\ntremendous \n&gt; &gt;&gt;surrender.

They need to be simpli=\r\nfied. Especially, people from monotheistic \n&gt; &gt;&gt;belief systems and subscrip=\r\ntion based religions need simpler models of divinity. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;So Upanishads an=\r\nd scriptures need to be interpreted so as to be palatable to \n&gt; &gt;&gt;them.

In the former, one=\r\n is cleaning up a dirty place that one is \n&gt; &gt;&gt;forced to live in. In the la=\r\ntter, one is going to someone else&#39;s dirty place and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;cleaning it up. I=\r\nf there is some radioactive waste there and one is not \n&gt; &gt;&gt;protected, one =\r\nmay be affected.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I keep saying, results of one&#39;s =\r\nprevious karmas are like fruits lying \n&gt; &gt;&gt;in a basket. One takes out one f=\r\nruit after another and eats them. Some may be \n&gt; &gt;&gt;tasty and some may be bi=\r\ntter or rotten. When one does rituals and other \n&gt; &gt;&gt;spiritual sadhana, the=\r\n deities throw away some bad fruits into a trash can and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;make one eat =\r\ngood fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be some spillage \n&gt; &gt;&gt;as =\r\ndirty fruits are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may =\r\nbe \n&gt; &gt;&gt;affected by the spillage.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, p=\r\nriests did intense sadhana and generated enough purity \n&gt; &gt;&gt;to handle such =\r\nthings. Many priests of today do not do enough penance. They are \n&gt; &gt;&gt;quite=\r\n vulnerable as they start messing with other people&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, many priests of today who conduct poojas are not really=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt;brahmanas. Being born to a brahmana father is neither necessary nor s=\r\nufficient \n&gt; &gt;&gt;for one to become a brahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitu=\r\nde and actions have \n&gt; &gt;&gt;to be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today think of=\r\n power and influence over \n&gt; &gt;&gt;others or of money or of comforts. They are =\r\nnot thinking just of knowledge and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;liberation. They are not really bra=\r\nhmanas. In fact, there are very very few \n&gt; &gt;&gt;brahmanas on earth right now.=\r\n Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed \n&gt; &gt;&gt;for others only by b=\r\nrahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;influence, mone=\r\ny and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, stop doing =\r\nrituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance \n&gt; &gt;&gt;when you are not =\r\ndoing rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana \n&gt; &gt;&gt;lifestyle=\r\n described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly \n&gt; &gt;&gt;beco=\r\nme a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriya=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt;&gt;and vaisyas.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reg=\r\narding mail 2 below on astrologers:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not an i=\r\nmmature comment and there is an element of truth in it. A \n&gt; &gt;&gt;lot of what =\r\nI said above applies here too.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every action performe=\r\nd with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces \n&gt; &gt;&gt;an equal reaction. =\r\nIf an astrologer&#39;s action of giving advice to someone \n&gt; &gt;&gt;resulted in that=\r\n person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;experiencing Z =\r\ninstead of W in coming years, there is clearly an action here. If \n&gt; &gt;&gt;the =\r\nastrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to \n&gt; &gt;&gt;e=\r\nxperience the fruits of it. Some blessings can come and some sufferings can=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt;come too.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s karmas i=\r\ns always a risky business.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the solution? Wel=\r\nl, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow \n&gt; &gt;&gt;a brahmana lifestyle d=\r\nescribed in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to \n&gt; &gt;&gt;truly become=\r\n a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;kshatriyas=\r\n and vaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one \n&gt; &gt;&gt;w=\r\nill become a brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to =\r\nplay \n&gt; &gt;&gt;with the karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by co=\r\nnducting \n&gt; &gt;&gt;rituals. Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas=\r\n by birth, but \n&gt; &gt;&gt;about brahmanas by conduct.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nabove will become clear, if you look at the criteria laid about by \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Par=\r\nasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught Jyotish!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyot=\r\nish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ri=\r\ntual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil=\r\nms.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 1:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.=\r\nrudra@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any curse=\r\n(Shapam)?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This I am asking after seeing the overall and genera=\r\nl condition of \n&gt; &gt;&gt;Brahmanas specially those who do pujas for Yajmanas and=\r\n involved in Karmakanda.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if this is true is there any reme=\r\ndy for this?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the only place where we can discu=\r\nss this subject hence \n&gt; &gt;&gt;I am posting this query here.Thanks a lot in adv=\r\nance.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 2:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nara=\r\nsimhaji and other educated Scholars,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have just=\r\n started listening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training \n&gt; &gt;&gt;sessions and a=\r\nm very eager to review my own chart. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Howev=\r\ner in numerous instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends \n&gt; &gt;&gt;and c=\r\nlose uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse impact on yourself \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;(astrologer) and yrou family.
