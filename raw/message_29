The fight for equality has been the foremost social-\npolitical conce=\r\nrn globally for the past 250 years, inspiring wars, \nrevolutions, Marxist t=\r\notalitarianism, genocides, and devastating \nsocial upheaval.  So central ha=\r\ns the concept of Radical \nEgalitarianism been in the modern political lands=\r\ncape that it has \noften overshadowed every other political, philosophical, =\r\nand social \nconcern we can think of.  \n \nDespite three continuous centuries=\r\n of forcing &quot;Enlightenment&quot; era \nnotions of equality upon humanity, however=\r\n, the world&#39;s problems have \nonly gotten infinitely worse.  With more pover=\r\nty, more corruption, \nmore wars, more unethical behavior, an ever-deeper se=\r\nnse of \nmeaningless in the world&#39;s youth, and the increasingly rapid \ncoars=\r\nening and degeneration of traditional cultures globally, many \nintellectual=\r\ns and spiritually oriented people are today beginning to \nask the inevitabl=\r\ne question:  &quot;Has the dogma of radical \negalitarianism actually outlived it=\r\ns usefulness?&quot;  \n \nThe answer to this question, from the perspective of San=\r\natana Dharma \n(Hinduism) is neither a yes nor a no, but rather leads us to =\r\nthe more \nphilosophically sophisticated question of:  &quot;What is the nature o=\r\nf \nthe human person?&quot;  For only in knowing this can we understand the \ntrue=\r\n nature and meaning of equality.  In the following, I will \nexplain the Dha=\r\nrmic view of equality juxtaposed to the materialist-\noriented Radical Egali=\r\ntarianism that the world has fervently pursued \nfor the last several centur=\r\nies.  \n \nThe metaphysical premises of Radical Egalitarianism are based upon=\r\n an \noutlook of empiricist materialism that views the human individual as \n=\r\nconsisting of nothing more than merely the physical, the body.  For \nthe ma=\r\nterialist, human beings do not have a soul, or an intrinsic \nessence, that =\r\ntranscends the material body, which is itself composed \nof nothing more tha=\r\nn the combination of chemicals and material \nsubstances formed over myriad =\r\nmillennia via the process of \nevolution.  The human individual, for the Rad=\r\nical Egalitarian, is a \nsoulless and ultimately purposeless machine, an aut=\r\nomaton whose only \nmeaning lies in whatever material and economic contribut=\r\nions the \nindividual can make to the greater social whole.  Thus, one &quot;livi=\r\nng \nbody&quot; is just as good as any other.  \n \nSuch a mechanistic view of the =\r\nhuman individual has led not only to \nthe notion of radical equality, but a=\r\nlso to the consequent view that \nall human individuals are ultimately equal=\r\nly worthless.  Thus we have \nseen the birth of the &quot;end justifies the means=\r\n&quot; form of &quot;ethics&quot; that \nhas arisen amongst the Marxists, and the consequen=\r\nt death and \ngenocide that has resulted from every Communist regime the wor=\r\nld has \never known.  If all human bodies are of equal worth, then no one \ni=\r\nndividual is of more importance than any other individual.  Thus all \nare e=\r\nqually expendable.  \n \nA society that sees humans as soulless is a society =\r\nthat sees human \nbeings as being of no more worth than machines.  And machi=\r\nnes are \nsimply tools to be used for the benefit of the state.  For the \nRa=\r\ndical Egalitarian, the human being is no more than a means to an \nend, an o=\r\nbject for their own use, rather than a subject worthy of all \nthe dignity, =\r\nappreciation, and respect that a unique human person \ndeserves.  \n \nThe Dha=\r\nrmic view of equality and the human person is considerably \nmore sophistica=\r\nted, compassionate, and thus ethical, than the \nmaterialist egalitarian app=\r\nroach.  For the conscious and sincere \nfollower of Sanatana Dharma, the hum=\r\nan person consists of infinitely \nmore than the mere bodily surface appeara=\r\nnce.  The old adage that one \ncannot judge a book by its cover comes to min=\r\nd when we examine the \nwisdom of the Dharmic approach.  \n \nRather than simp=\r\nlistically attempting to reduce a human person to \nbeing merely the visible=\r\n material body that one can immediately \ndetect with the senses, Dharma tea=\r\nches us that the typical human \nbeing is actually a multi-faceted and multi=\r\n-dimensional being, with a \nmaterial dimension, a causal dimension, and ult=\r\nimately a spiritual \ndimension that is not always clearly visible to the un=\r\ntrained eye.  \nThe human person consists of a) deha (physical body), b) man=\r\nas (mind \nsubstance, including impressionistic data, memory, etc.), c) budd=\r\nhi \n(the rational faculties), d) ahamkara (false, individuating ego), and \n=\r\nmost importantly e) atman (the true, spiritual self).  \n \nAccording to the =\r\nDharma world-view, we certainly are beings who \npossess bodies =96 no sane =\r\nperson would deny this immediate empirical \nfact.  Indeed, contrary to the =\r\nunnatural and illogical conclusions \nthat the Radical Egalitarian draws fro=\r\nm this simple fact, from a \npurely physical perspective, there is actually =\r\nan almost infinitely \ngreat degree of diversity and inequality that is clea=\r\nrly empirically \nseen.  Physically speaking, no two people in the world are=\r\n really the \nsame.  Some are tall, others short.  One person is strong, ano=\r\nther \nweak.  Some need glasses, hearing aids, or other devices to &quot;even out=\r\n \nthe playing field&quot; (i.e., pretend that we are all physically equal!), \not=\r\nher people are free from physical defects altogether.  The \ndiversity we fi=\r\nnd in physical bodies is endless.  That is common \nsense.  By extension, wh=\r\nen looking at the minds and the intellectual \ncapacities of various individ=\r\nuals, we clearly see that some are more \nintelligent than others.  Some are=\r\n more naturally artistic and \ncreative, whereas some are more analytical an=\r\nd cerebral.  Some people \nwill have mental or emotional challenges, such as=\r\n psychosis, bipolar \ndisorder, or retardation, others have minds so healthy=\r\n as to allow \nthem to view reality with tremendous clarity.  \n \nEgoic desir=\r\nes, preferences and goals, too, are as diverse in content \nand quantity as =\r\nare the numerous people we see around us.  Some \naspire to become great wor=\r\nld leaders.  Others desire wealth, or fame, \nor romantic love.  Some people=\r\n, by contrast, seem to have a profound \nyearning to know God, and serve the=\r\nir fellow beings with humility, \nsimplicity, deep compassion, and quiet det=\r\nermination.  We are all \ndifferent from one another.  Thus, we are all in s=\r\no many ways unequal \nin our appearance, our abilities, our preferences, and=\r\n our desires.\n \nRather than attempting to lie to ourselves and artificially=\r\n fly in \nthe face of clearly discernable empirical facts, Sanatana Dharma \n=\r\nencourages all human beings to respect each other, honor our \ndifferences, =\r\nand work together in compassion, dignity and harmony, \ndespite our undeniab=\r\nle recognition of all our many differences.  \nSanatana Dharma (the Eternal =\r\nNatural Way), thus gives us the \nempowerment to live in accordance with the=\r\n natural order of the \nuniverse in a manner that is beneficial to all.  \n \n=\r\nFor Dharma, the realm of true equality lies not on the physical, \nmental, i=\r\nntellectual, or egoic planes, but in the realm of spirit.  \nHaving God as o=\r\nur sole source, sustainer, and ultimate destiny, we \nall share in the same =\r\nparent.  From a spiritual perspective, then, in \nthe deepest essence of who=\r\n we are as pure spiritual beings (atman), \nwe are all equally the children =\r\nof God.  \n \nYour true, spiritual self (atman) does not have color, nor dime=\r\nnsion, \nnor race, nor class, nor gender.  In spirit, you are neither a \ncap=\r\nitalist, nor a communist.  You are neither Indian, nor Black, nor \nWhite no=\r\nr Latin.  Rather, your true self is the eternal, perfect, \nblissful spiritu=\r\nal center of your everyday existence: Atman.    \n \nTranscending both the bo=\r\ndily dimensions of life and all limited \nmateriality, your true self finds =\r\nitself currently situated in your \nbody due only to your own free-will desi=\r\nres, motivations, \nconsciousness, and actions of the past.  Karma is the ca=\r\nusal \nantecedent of all the diverse material bodies that we see around us. =\r\n \nWhile our bodies and minds are all radically different, however, the \nsou=\r\nls of every living being are all equally held in the compassionate \nglance =\r\nof God&#39;s merciful and loving gaze.  To God, we are all equally \nHis childre=\r\nn, temporarily separated from Him, but all destined to one \nday again be in=\r\n His loving embrace.  \n \nEquality is an exceedingly important goal toward w=\r\nhich we should all \naspire.  In the political realm, Dharma calls upon each=\r\n of us to \nalways be compassionate, just, and fair to all we encounter, no =\r\n\nmatter how different they may seem to us in physical appearance.  The \nonl=\r\ny truly pure equality that exists, however, is that equality that \nexists o=\r\nn the spiritual realm.  Thus, in the transcendental eyes of \nthe yogi, or p=\r\nure sage, all living being are seen with equal vision \n(sama darshina).  \n =\r\n\nThis concept of spiritually-inspired equal vision is beautifully \nexplaine=\r\nd to us by Lord Sri Krishna in His famous Bhagavad Gita (Song \nof God).  In=\r\n the 18th verse of chapter 5, Lord Krishna instructs His \ndevotee Arjuna in=\r\n the following way:\n \n \nVidya-vinaya-sampanne\nBrahmane gavi hastini\nShuni c=\r\naiva shvapake cha\nPanditah sama-darshinah\n \n \n&quot;The humble sage, by virtue o=\r\nf true knowledge,\nsees with equal vision [sama-darshina]\nthe learned and ge=\r\nntle priest, a cow, an elephant,\na dog or an outcaste.&quot;\n \n \nIndeed, because=\r\n the humble sage views the diverse beings around him, \nnot as mere mechanis=\r\ntic bodies, but as all possessing a pure spirit \nsoul (atman), he does not =\r\neven see the difference between different \nspecies of life, what to speak o=\r\nf different kinds of human beings!  \nTo the sage, the soul of the cow, and =\r\nthe dog, and the elephant is \njust a worthy of dignity, respect, and spirit=\r\nual equality as is the \nsoul contained in the human being.  Sama Darshina, =\r\nor equal spiritual \nvision, is the highest form of equality toward which we=\r\n can all \naspire =96 for it sees the inherent equality that exists in the \n=\r\nspiritual essence of all living beings.  Seeing all beings as our \nspiritua=\r\nl brothers and sisters, we will then, by natural extension, \noffer all peop=\r\nle our respect on the political, social, cultural, and \neconomic realms.  \n=\r\n \nThe truly equal society, then, is the Dharmic society, a society \ncompris=\r\ned of citizens who aspire toward the finer and nobler \nspiritual aspiration=\r\ns of life, and who thus view the world from a \nspiritual perspective.  That=\r\n nation which will most justly serve the \ninterests of its people is the Dh=\r\narma Nation.  Make yourself a truly \nworthy citizen of God&#39;s Dharma Nation =\r\nby spiritualizing your own \nvision and viewing your neighbors and fellow li=\r\nving beings as the \natmans they truly are.
