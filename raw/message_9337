Please realize that =\r\nit is supposed to be one akshara (syllable). If you add a or u at the end, =\r\nyou are creating an extra syllable (sau-hu or sau-ha).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Some explanation here: If you take &quot;vAk&quot;, it is one aks=\r\nhara.Note that kshara=3Dhighly transient, akhara=3Dnon-transient. Consonant=\r\ns by themselves are too transient to live. Try saying &quot;v&quot; or &quot;k&quot;. Vowels ar=\r\ne the life force that make sounds non-transient. If you add A to v, you get=\r\n &quot;vA&quot;. While you can&#39;t sustain the sound &quot;v&quot; (too transient, i.e. kshara), =\r\nyou CAN sustain the sound &quot;vA&quot; and pronounce it audibly and in a non-transi=\r\nent fashion.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; However, if you add &quot;k&quot; to it, it has no life fo=\r\nrce of its own and perishes transiently. So it is not a separate akshara an=\r\nd vAk together is one akshara.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Now, if you add a or u to it and =\r\nmake it &quot;vAka&quot; or &quot;vAku&quot;, then ka/ku becomes a separate akshara. While &quot;k&quot; =\r\nis a transient sound that perishes quickly, &quot;ka&quot; and &quot;ku&quot; are non-transient=\r\n.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Same holds for &quot;sauha&quot; or &quot;sauhu&quot;. Also for &quot;rAmaha&quot;, &quot;harihi&quot;=\r\n, &quot;guruhu&quot; etc. The way many people pronounce visarga, they end up adding a=\r\nn extra vowel and creating an extra akshara. It is obviously incorrect.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; The word &quot;visarga&quot; means &quot;discharging=\r\n or letting go&quot;. It is simple release of air from lungs. It sounds *similar=\r\n* to &quot;h&quot; sound (without any vowel added at the end), but lighter than it. W=\r\nhether you pronounce &quot;rAmaH&quot; or &quot;hariH&quot; or &quot;guruH&quot; or &quot;sauH&quot;, the visarga (=\r\nH) in each case is a *very light* version of plain consonant &quot;h&quot;, with no v=\r\nowel added at the end.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Now, the other=\r\n thing is the pronunciation of vowel &quot;au&quot; in &quot;sauH&quot;. One pronunciationis so=\r\nmewhat close to &quot;o&quot; in &quot;doctor&quot;.One pronunciation is closer to &quot;avu&quot;. If yo=\r\nu phonologically analyze and experiment with the vriddhi sandhi rule (a + e=\r\n =3D ai, a + o =3D au), you will realize that the former pronunciation is c=\r\nloser to truth.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If you formally studied linguistics and know &quot;vo=\r\nwel trapezium&quot;, u is at the top of the back and o is below it. The &quot;au&quot; sou=\r\nnd is below &quot;o&quot; and above &quot;a&quot; - half the way in between. The way some peopl=\r\ne pronounce it (&quot;savuhu&quot;), they are actually saying 3 aksharas/syllables (s=\r\na-vu-hu) for what is supposed to be just one!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; Like I always say, correct pronunciation is only 1% important. Do=\r\nn&#39;t intentionally mis-pronounce when you know what is correct. However, don=\r\n&#39;t worry about what you are not sure of and do your best. Intention, sincer=\r\nity and surrender are far more important than pronunciation. There may be m=\r\nantras (e.g. Veda mantras) that work magically just with correct pronunciat=\r\nion, but there is nobody now who can pronounce them perfectly. So forget ab=\r\nout technicalities and inculcate sincerity and devotion.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best=\r\n regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;________________=\r\n________________\n&gt; &gt; From: sillylallypally &lt;sillylallypally@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;Sent: Thursday, May 23, 2013 9:02 PM\n&gt; &gt;Subje=\r\nct: [vedic-wisdom] Re: bija pronounciation\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;Sir,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;In my opinion the correct pronunciation is &#39;Sauha&#39;, not &#39;Sauhu&#39;.
