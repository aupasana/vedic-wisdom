I am impressed with this work.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n The book is called &quot;Invading the Sacred: An Analysis of Hinduism Studies i=\r\nn\n&gt; America&quot; (editors: Krishnan Ramaswamy, Antonio de Nicolas and Aditi\n&gt; B=\r\nanerjee). It has 29 scholarly articles organized in 4 sections.\n&gt;\n&gt; Pervert=\r\ned scholars with perverted anti-Hindu agendas that look down upon\n&gt; India a=\r\nnd Hinduism with a colonial viewpoint have conducted perverted\n&gt; researches=\r\n in the name of academic freedom at the religious studies\n&gt; departments of =\r\nwestern universities, published them and gained name and\n&gt; fame, trampling =\r\nthe sacred in the process. Crying foul or getting frustrated\n&gt; with this wi=\r\nll not improve the situation or solve the problem. Interested\n&gt; religious s=\r\ncholars have to firmly and patiently crtique these works in the\n&gt; same acad=\r\nemic style, in order to reclaim the rightful place for Hinduism.\n&gt;\n&gt; Severa=\r\nl papers in this book do exactly that. They take specific works by\n&gt; wester=\r\nn scholars and rebut them quite well and show how they are fallacious,\n&gt; ha=\r\nsty, nonsensical or sometimes downright manipulative or filled with lies.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; I will just give an example of the offensive work that was reb=\r\nutted in this\n&gt; book. [Warning: Those who are sensitive to offensive writin=\r\ngs should skip\n&gt; the next three paragraphs.]\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeffrey Kripal from Univ o=\r\nf Chicago visited Ramakrishna Mission in West\n&gt; Bengal and did research on =\r\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa. Several people there\n&gt; enthusiastically helped him=\r\n in the researches. In the end, what he produced\n&gt; is utterly nonsensical a=\r\nnd filled with lies. He published his PhD\n&gt; dissertation without showing it=\r\n to Ramakrishna Mission people to check for\n&gt; factual or linguistic inaccur=\r\nacies. Ramakrishna mission people found out\n&gt; about what he produced only y=\r\nears later, after his book &quot;Kali&#39;s Child&quot; based\n&gt; on the PhD dissertation w=\r\non great acclaim in the West. He won an award at\n&gt; the Americal Academy of =\r\nReligion for that book, landed a job at Harvard and\n&gt; his book was sadly me=\r\nntioned in the Encyclopedia Britannica as the *number\n&gt; one* choice for lea=\r\nrning about Ramakrishna.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the book, he portrayed Ramakrishna as a sex=\r\nually perverted person, a\n&gt; homosexual and a pedophile. He did not know Ben=\r\ngali or Hindi or Sanskrit\n&gt; well and did not take help from any Bengali peo=\r\nple at the Mission for this\n&gt; work. He used his own faulty translations, wi=\r\nllful distortions and\n&gt; manipulation of sources to arrive at sensational (a=\r\nnd damning) conclusions.\n&gt; For example, he translated a word that means &quot;la=\r\np&quot; as &quot;genitals&quot;, in the\n&gt; context of Swami Brahmananda (spiritual son of R=\r\namakrishna and a young boy\n&gt; then) sitting in Ramakrishna&#39;s lap. He transla=\r\nted a word that means\n&gt; &quot;touching softly&quot; as &quot;uncontrollably rubbing sandal=\r\npaste on the penises of\n&gt; boys&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even in places where there was no mate=\r\nrial to mis-translate, he simply\n&gt; speculated! For example, he speculated o=\r\nn the meeting of Totapuri and\n&gt; Ramakrishna, in which the naaga sadhu (nake=\r\nd ascetic) Totapuri taught\n&gt; advaita vedanta to Ramakrishna and made him go=\r\n beyond Mother Kali and\n&gt; experience nirvikalpa samadhi: &quot;What it must have=\r\n been like for Ramakrishna,\n&gt; a homosexually oriented man, to be shut away =\r\nfor days in a small hut with\n&gt; another, stark-naked man. Vedanta instructio=\r\nn or not, it was this man&#39;s\n&gt; nudity, and more especially, his penis, that =\r\nnormally caught Ramakrishna&#39;s\n&gt; attention. How could it not?&quot; Please note t=\r\nhat he is not referring to any\n&gt; source and mis-translating it, but simply =\r\nspeculating based on his perverted\n&gt; agenda!\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; If you see the b=\r\nook, you will see many examples of such pseudo-scholarship\n&gt; driven by hein=\r\nous agendas. It is a fact that many perverted people under\n&gt; asuric influen=\r\nces make their livelihood, money and fame lying and spreading\n&gt; falsehoods =\r\nabout Hinduism, Hindu deities and Hindu saints.\n&gt;\n&gt; Those who are not incli=\r\nned to fight a dharma yuddha against this may ignore\n&gt; this and go on doing=\r\n their sadhana. After all, if enough people do sadhana\n&gt; to strengthen sana=\r\ntana dharma, this kind of things will automatically\n&gt; weaken. However, some=\r\n scholars engaging these pseudo-scholars academically\n&gt; is really required =\r\non the ground.
