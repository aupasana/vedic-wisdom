What is=\r\n the common sense understanding, but one gained from observation of life up=\r\ntill the age of say 18!\n=A0\nSomething moving at an extremely fast pace does=\r\n not observe space-time as you or I do. Inside an atom there is not a well =\r\ndefined path for a electron to revolve around. but merely clouds of probabi=\r\nlity ! Which means what someone can say at best is the probability of findi=\r\nng an electron at a certain distance from the nucleus, only a probability.\n=\r\n=A0\nAnd all these have been derived from hardcore mathematical process. Not=\r\n just speculations. \n=A0\nAfter reading Narasimhaji&#39;s mail I realized the pr=\r\noblem arises because of the structure of our commonsense at this reference =\r\nframe. That is why when we are here, this theoritical problem arises, but s=\r\nay you become the supreme being, the problem itself does not exist. \n=A0\nTh=\r\nere are a set of particles called Tachyons which move at speeds greater tha=\r\nn that of light and whole of cause and effect gets reversed for them. That =\r\nis, the effect precedes the cause in a universe where the things happen fas=\r\nter than the speed of light. In such a place one would probably get the res=\r\nults of an exam even before one appears for the exam!\n=A0\nSo this idea of l=\r\ninear cause followed by effect makes sense only here, and this cannot be su=\r\nperimposed on other frames of reference, where the question itself may brea=\r\nkdown.Thus the idea of God having fixed everything may not make any sense t=\r\no God, but creates a lot of theoritical confusion for us. \n=A0\nI am not sur=\r\ne if I have been able to convey what I was trying, I just made an attempt.\n=\r\n=A0\n-Regards\n=A0Rajarshi\n=A0\n=A0\n=A0\n\n\n\n=A0\n\nThe upsurge (of consciousness)=\r\n is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n\n--- On Thu, 2/7/09, utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@=\r\nyahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nSubject: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] Re: Freewill.\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Thursday,=\r\n 2 July, 2009, 11:49 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamaste Narasimha garu,\n\nThere are few thin=\r\ngs from your message which i am trying to link for clearly understanding th=\r\nis puzzel of free/fix will.\n\n1) &gt;there is nothing that is unknown to Him.

Wi=\r\nthin the limits imposed by the &gt;reactions given by nature to your own previ=\r\nous actions, you do have &gt;a scope for engaging in different actions at this=\r\n time.\n\nThe above are main two points if understood and linked can give cla=\r\nrity.\n\nyou have brought to me a very FRESH Knowledge that most of Yogi&#39;s ca=\r\nn find out one or two possibilities of future depending upon the space-time=\r\n cycle zone in which their consciouness can access. a really advance yogi c=\r\nan see more possibilities of future events due to their access of more time=\r\n cycles. BUT please explain to me about the supreme cosmic being who is a s=\r\nole link between Dual and Non-dual self. now as you have mentioned (pl. ref=\r\ner to no.1 above) he is all knower so every possibility is known to him and=\r\n not only every possibility but even every action going to be taken in a pe=\r\nrticular Space-time zone and what the eventual result. we call him by Naraa=\r\nyana/Shiva/ Bhagavati/ GOD/Allah/ Ganapati (As per Atharvashirsh) and many =\r\nsuch names depending on our faiths. \n\nThe point no.1 indicates that HE is a=\r\nll knower and point no.2 indicates that Free will is certainly there at our=\r\n Spac-time level.

It is either this or that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both are correct, =\r\nbut at different levels. I will elaborate. However, this is philosophically=\r\n complex and those who do not follow what I say should not worry at all.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Non-dual self has no division of self into various objects or=\r\n space or time. There is no concept of time or space or space-time continuu=\r\nm within non-dual self. A yogi absorbed in non-dual self has no sense of sp=\r\nace or time or objectification.\n&gt; \n&gt; Supreme cosmic being is the link betwe=\r\nen duality and non-duality. Supreme cosmic being arising in this non-dual s=\r\nelf captures the entire field of duality within Him. All beings, entire spa=\r\nce and all space-time continua within the field of duality exist within Him=\r\n. From the perspective of supreme cosmic being, all beings of the dual worl=\r\nd are His parts and all their individual wills are parts of His cosmic will=\r\n. As all space-time continua are within Him, there is nothing that is unkno=\r\nwn to Him. Past, present and future; here, there and everywhere; I, you and=\r\n others, this possibility, that possibility and yet another possibility - a=\r\nll are accessible and fully &quot;known&quot; to His self-awareness.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, let us=\r\n come lower and into the field of duality. The field of duality consists of=\r\n infinite divisions of space, time and space-time continua. There are infin=\r\nite possibilities within this field.\n&gt; \n&gt; Normally, people stuck deeply wit=\r\nhin duality have a linear sense of time and perceive just a part of one spa=\r\nce-time continuum. However, field of duality also contains planes of consci=\r\nousness where different senses of time and different space-time continua (t=\r\nhat may intersect at various points) exist. A yogi who experiences such a s=\r\npace-time continuum in such a plane of consciousness may experience a point=\r\n of time that maps to a future time in a regular space-time continuum being=\r\n experienced by you. Also, what is 1 minute in one space-time continuum may=\r\n be 1 year in another space-time continuum. Time is not as straight-forward=\r\n an entity as one may think. Basically, the field of duality contains infin=\r\nite space-time continua and what one experiences depends on the plane of co=\r\nnsciousness that one&#39;s self-awareness (Kundalini) is in. But, most of us ex=\r\nperience part of a specific space-time continuum and hence think that that =\r\nis the only reality. But relaity\n consists of infinite space-time continua =\r\nthat intersect each other. These are all different possibilities and you ch=\r\nart out your course based on your actions and Nature&#39;s reactions to your ac=\r\ntions.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; From the perspective of a yogi who is in a different=\r\n space-time continuum, your state may be known at a time that is in &quot;future=\r\n&quot; as per the space-time continuum in which you exist. But, from the perspec=\r\ntive of the space-time continuum that you are in, your state at that future=\r\n time is not yet known and depends on your current action.\n&gt; \n&gt; If a yogi i=\r\nn a different space-time continuum has seen your state in future, his obser=\r\nvation is merely an observation and from his reference frame. It has no cau=\r\nsal relationship to your current action or your future state. He is merely =\r\nan observer and he does not cause anything to happen. His observation is sp=\r\necific to some space-time pairs and does not cover all the space-time pairs=\r\n that you will traverse as you travel to reach the space-time pair where he=\r\n observed you (if at all you do!).\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us go further. Is th=\r\nere only one future possible for you? Or, does the path traversed by you in=\r\n space-time continuum not fixed but variable based on your actions? Can you=\r\nr actions at important cross-roads alter the course you traverse?\n&gt; \n&gt; If s=\r\no, what is the meaning of a yogi observing you at a space-time pair? Is his=\r\n observation only a possibility or a certainty? One may say &quot;how can one ob=\r\nserve a possibility? Anything we observe must be a certainty.&quot; But is that =\r\ncorrect? Aren&#39;t the field of duality and the infinite space-time continua c=\r\nontained in it merely a set of infinite possibilities?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some great rish=\r\nis can see not just a space-time pair, but many space-time continua at the =\r\nsame time, i.e. they can see various possibilities based on various possibl=\r\ne actions. However, visions seen by most yogis about &quot;future&quot; are just one =\r\npossibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline: At the level at which we exist, th=\r\nere is certainly something called &quot;freewill&quot;. Within the limits imposed by =\r\nthe reactions given by nature to your own previous actions, you do have a s=\r\ncope for engaging in different actions at this time. Depending on which act=\r\nion you engage in, the future can be slightly different. Some actions can e=\r\nven make the future significantly different. A rishi may be able to chart o=\r\nut a significant portion of the field of possibilities for future (e.g. lik=\r\ne a brilliant chess player figuring out most possibilities upto 20 moves fr=\r\nom now). An advanced yogi may be able to see a few possibilities for future=\r\n (e.g. like a good chess player figuring out a few moves or guessing a futu=\r\nre position). But the supreme cosmic being knows the entire field of possib=\r\nilities, as they all exist within Him.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, your actions are what =\r\nbring to fruition (w.r.t. the reference frame of your consciousness! ) some=\r\n of those possibilities. One may know all the possibilities quite deeply an=\r\nd even guess the possibility that will come to fruition, but it is your act=\r\nions that actually make some of those possibilities a reality.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ ho=\r\nmam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n=\r\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish softwa=\r\nre (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) =\r\nwebsite: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: r=\r\najarshi nandy \n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June =\r\n30, 2009 5:22 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Freewill.\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Naras=\r\nimhaji\n&gt; \n&gt; No doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail for all of us, however,=\r\n I could not help it that an inevitable question popped up in my mind. One =\r\nof the oft discussed and eternal questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; If events have already bee=\r\nn created like in a movie and later as time unfolds, they happen in our pla=\r\nne of existence, then all talk of freewill must be humbug?

Both =\r\ncannot be correct. It is either this or that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Theoritically speaking, =\r\nsay tomorrow suddenly majority of the world reforms itself, does a self cor=\r\nrection exercise and brings in peace, harmony etc etc, then why should the =\r\nKalki Avatar still incarnate?

He =\r\ndid not know much about some of the ten incarnations. He described what he =\r\nsaw and I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the forms he=\r\n saw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty r=\r\noad. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; This b=\r\noy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was with him one=\r\n morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was abou a week afte=\r\nr the episode mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt; \n&gt; I asked what he was thinkin=\r\ng. He said, &quot;it is not that the future that is to come has not already happ=\r\nened. It has already happened in reality, but it will happen later when the=\r\n time comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, but p=\r\nretended not to know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He said, &quot;I don&#39;=\r\nt know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known to be overly i=\r\nntelligent or articulate. His main characteristic is that he is usually che=\r\nerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he was onto so=\r\nmething today. But he could not express himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; I helped him, &quot;do you=\r\n mean to say that future has already happened at some level, but will revea=\r\nl itself to people later? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot =\r\nand become ready in a studio. Some people may have already seen it. But peo=\r\nple seeing it on the screen later will think it is happening in front of th=\r\nem. Are you saying something like that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That =\r\nis what I am saying. If something is going to happen in future, it will hap=\r\npen when future comes. But somebody may be able to see it before future com=\r\nes, because it has already happened.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Though he did not mention it, I =\r\nknew why he was thinking along these lines. When I told him the man riding =\r\nthe horse in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he =\r\nwas probably confused. Given his age and ability to think and understand th=\r\nings, this probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see somebod=\r\ny who had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible and c=\r\name to some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Time se=\r\nems linear at the level of regular consciousness. However, in many planes o=\r\nf conssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It even loses its me=\r\naning when one is established in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=\r\n * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small=\r\n naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When w=\r\ne were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful ene=\r\nrgy. It was quite different from the energy I feel normally. This intense e=\r\nnergy made my mind feel satisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be lo=\r\nosely expressed in words as &quot;I am done here. I have nothing more left to do=\r\n. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire consciousnss.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had experienced the =\r\nsame kind of intense energy twice before that. Once I experienced the same =\r\nenergy when I was meditating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a=\r\n Chandi homam in India. Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunit=\r\ny to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 =\r\nfeet from the main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by=\r\n a great saint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three=\r\n occasions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interesti=\r\nngly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out=\r\n of all the different homas I did so far, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I ask=\r\ned him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it, but it just felt awesome =\r\nand different.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; This boy performed a really simple and shor=\r\nt procedure, shorter than what I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was=\r\n successful in making a powerful energy manifest there. The bottomline is t=\r\nhat internal purity is the most important thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rituals help purify o=\r\nne and purity helps one do a ritual better and get more out of it. It is an=\r\n egg and chicken problem and one has to keep doing it until one breaks thro=\r\nugh.\n&gt; \n&gt; Keep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do pay atten=\r\ntion to internal purity as you engage in external practices. The only worth=\r\nwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how smaller your ego beco=\r\nmes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist attraction to external things b=\r\netter and you can resist internal enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc bet=\r\nter. You can do your dharma better. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and thi=\r\ns is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of all problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Overcoming=\r\n ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easier=\r\n. Think that all that is around you - including your house, money, cars, sp=\r\nouse, children and your own body - is god&#39;s property and that you are a tem=\r\nporary caretaker of all of these properties of god. Do the best job you can=\r\n, but without entertaining the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant ta=\r\nkes very good care of his master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all =\r\nthose things as his or her belongings.\n&gt; \n&gt; Realize that thinking of things=\r\n as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for taking good care of them.

What is the commo=\r\nn sense understanding, but one gained from observation of life uptill the a=\r\nge of say 18!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Something moving at an extremely=\r\n fast pace does not observe space-time as you or I do. Inside an atom there=\r\n is not a well defined path for a electron to revolve around. but merely &lt;E=\r\nM&gt;clouds of probability &lt;/EM&gt;! Which means what someone can say at best is =\r\nthe &lt;EM&gt;probability&lt;/EM&gt; of finding an electron at a certain distance from =\r\nthe nucleus, only a probability.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;And all these=\r\n have been derived from hardcore mathematical process. Not just speculation=\r\ns. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;After reading Narasimhaji&#39;s mail I realize=\r\nd the problem arises because of the structure of our commonsense at this re=\r\nference frame. That is why when we are here, this theoritical problem arise=\r\ns, but say you become the supreme being, the problem itself does not exist.=\r\n &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;There are a set of particles called Tachyons=\r\n which move at speeds greater than that of light and whole of cause and eff=\r\nect gets reversed for them. That is, the effect precedes the cause in a uni=\r\nverse where the things happen faster than the speed of light. In such a pla=\r\nce one would probably get the results of an exam even before one appears fo=\r\nr the exam!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;So this idea of linear cause follo=\r\nwed by effect makes sense only here, and this cannot be superimposed on oth=\r\ner frames of reference, where the question itself may breakdown.Thus the id=\r\nea of God having fixed everything may not make any sense to God, but create=\r\ns a lot of theoritical confusion for us. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I am=\r\n not sure if I have been able to convey what I was trying, I just made an a=\r\nttempt.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D=\r\n&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier c=\r\nolor=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;The upsurge (of consciousness=\r\n) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/E=\r\nM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Thu, 2/7/09, utpal pathak &lt;I&gt;&lt;vedic_pathak@yah=\r\noo.com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGI=\r\nN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: utpal pathak =\r\n&lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Freewill.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Thursday, 2 July, 2009, 11:49 AM&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1998408602&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Narasimh=\r\na garu,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are few things from your message which i am trying to =\r\nlink for clearly understanding this puzzel of free/fix will.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) &gt;=\r\nthere is nothing that is unknown to Him.

Within the lim=\r\nits imposed by the &gt;reactions given by nature to your own previous actio=\r\nns, you do have &gt;a scope for engaging in different actions at this time.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The above are main two points if understood and linked can give cla=\r\nrity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;you have brought to me a very FRESH Knowledge that most of Yog=\r\ni&#39;s can find out one or two possibilities of future depending upon the spac=\r\ne-time cycle zone in which their consciouness\n can access. a really advance=\r\n yogi can see more possibilities of future events due to their access of mo=\r\nre time cycles. BUT please explain to me about the supreme cosmic being who=\r\n is a sole link between Dual and Non-dual self. now as you have mentioned (=\r\npl. refer to no.1 above) he is all knower so every possibility is known to =\r\nhim and not only every possibility but even every action going to be taken =\r\nin a perticular Space-time zone and what the eventual result. we call him b=\r\ny Naraayana/Shiva/ Bhagavati/ GOD/Allah/ Ganapati (As per Atharvashirsh) an=\r\nd many such names depending on our faiths. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The point no.1 indicates=\r\n that HE is all knower and point no.2 indicates that Free will is certainly=\r\n there at our Spac-time level. Now if ONE BEING knows everything including =\r\nEXACT action and EXACT REACTION, then would it be really called free will U=\r\nLTIMATELY? i know that it can be argued that HE ONLY KNOWS but DOES NOT INT=\r\nERFEAR and hence Free will exist but\n then what is the meaning of the verse=\r\ns in the context of the topic...&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Mohyante Mohitaashchaiv Mohameshyanti =\r\nchaapare...&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Mamatvagartetimaha andhakaare Vibhraamayatyetadat iv Vishv=\r\nam&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Tannatra vismay kaaryo yoganidra jagatpate&lt;BR&gt;Mahaamaayaa Hareshcha=\r\nishaa tayaa sammohyate jagat&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;....Mrigtrushna bhramayati&quot; of Gita&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;please forgive me for wiritng all these things but it is very difficu=\r\nlt for me to really reconcile and i think you are the only help for me.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Warm Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail=\r\n.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank =\r\nrel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisd=\r\nom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

It =\r\nis either this or that.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n Both are correct, but at differen=\r\nt levels. I will elaborate. However, this is philosophically complex and th=\r\nose who do not follow what I say should not worry at all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n* * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Non-dual self has no division of self into various o=\r\nbjects or space or time. There is no concept of time or space or space-time=\r\n continuum within non-dual self. A yogi absorbed in non-dual self has no se=\r\nnse of space or time or objectification.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Supreme cosmic be=\r\ning is the link between duality and non-duality. Supreme cosmic being arisi=\r\nng in this non-dual self captures the entire field of duality within Him. A=\r\nll beings, entire space and all space-time continua within the field of dua=\r\nlity exist within Him. From the perspective of supreme cosmic being, all be=\r\nings of the dual world are His parts and all their individual wills are par=\r\nts of His cosmic will. As all space-time continua are within Him, there is =\r\nnothing that is unknown to Him.\n Past, present and future; here, there and =\r\neverywhere; I, you and others, this possibility, that possibility and yet a=\r\nnother possibility - all are accessible and fully &quot;known&quot; to His self-aware=\r\nness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now, let us come lower and into the field of duality=\r\n. The field of duality consists of infinite divisions of space, time and sp=\r\nace-time continua. There are infinite possibilities within this field.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Normally, people stuck deeply within duality have a linear sen=\r\nse of time and perceive just a part of one space-time continuum. However, f=\r\nield of duality also contains planes of consciousness where different sense=\r\ns of time and different space-time continua (that may intersect at various =\r\npoints) exist. A yogi who experiences such a space-time continuum in such a=\r\n plane of consciousness may experience a point of time that maps to a futur=\r\ne time in a regular space-time continuum being experienced by you. Also, wh=\r\nat is 1 minute in one\n space-time continuum may be 1 year in another space-=\r\ntime continuum. Time is not as straight-forward an entity as one may think.=\r\n Basically, the field of duality contains infinite space-time continua and =\r\nwhat one experiences depends on the plane of consciousness that one&#39;s self-=\r\nawareness (Kundalini) is in. But, most of us experience part of a specific =\r\nspace-time continuum and hence think that that is the only reality. But rel=\r\naity consists of infinite space-time continua that intersect each other. Th=\r\nese are all different possibilities and you chart out your course based on =\r\nyour actions and Nature&#39;s reactions to your actions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From the perspective of a yogi who is in a different spac=\r\ne-time continuum, your state may be known at a time that is in &quot;future&quot; as =\r\nper the space-time continuum in which you exist. But, from the perspective =\r\nof the space-time continuum that you are in, your state at that future time=\r\n is not yet\n known and depends on your current action.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If =\r\na yogi in a different space-time continuum has seen your state in future, h=\r\nis observation is merely an observation and from his reference frame. It ha=\r\ns no causal relationship to your current action or your future state. He is=\r\n merely an observer and he does not cause anything to happen. His observati=\r\non is specific to some space-time pairs and does not cover all the space-ti=\r\nme pairs that you will traverse as you travel to reach the space-time pair =\r\nwhere he observed you (if at all you do!).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Let us go further. Is there only one future possible for you? Or, d=\r\noes the path traversed by you in space-time continuum not fixed but variabl=\r\ne based on your actions? Can your actions at important cross-roads alter th=\r\ne course you traverse?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If so, what is the meaning of a yog=\r\ni observing you at a space-time pair? Is his observation only a possibility=\r\n or a\n certainty? One may say &quot;how can one observe a possibility? Anything =\r\nwe observe must be a certainty.&quot; But is that correct? Aren&#39;t the field of d=\r\nuality and the infinite space-time continua contained in it merely a set of=\r\n infinite possibilities?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some great rishis can see not jus=\r\nt a space-time pair, but many space-time continua at the same time, i.e. th=\r\ney can see various possibilities based on various possible actions. However=\r\n, visions seen by most yogis about &quot;future&quot; are just one possibility.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bottomline: At the level at which we exi=\r\nst, there is certainly something called &quot;freewill&quot;. Within the limits impos=\r\ned by the reactions given by nature to your own previous actions, you do ha=\r\nve a scope for engaging in different actions at this time. Depending on whi=\r\nch action you engage in, the future can be slightly different. Some actions=\r\n can even make the future significantly different. A rishi may be able to\n =\r\nchart out a significant portion of the field of possibilities for future (e=\r\n.g. like a brilliant chess player figuring out most possibilities upto 20 m=\r\noves from now). An advanced yogi may be able to see a few possibilities for=\r\n future (e.g. like a good chess player figuring out a few moves or guessing=\r\n a future position). But the supreme cosmic being knows the entire field of=\r\n possibilities, as they all exist within Him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, you=\r\nr actions are what bring to fruition (w.r.t. the reference frame of your co=\r\nnsciousness! ) some of those possibilities. One may know all the possibilit=\r\nies quite deeply and even guess the possibility that will come to fruition,=\r\n but it is your actions that actually make some of those possibilities a re=\r\nality.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -----------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Ho=\r\nmam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot;\n target=3D_b=\r\nlank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wi=\r\nsdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.h=\r\nome.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.co=\r\nmcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://w=\r\nww.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJag=\r\nan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From:=\r\n rajarshi nandy\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/c=\r\nompose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow =\r\nymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups=\r\n. com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 30, 2009 5:22 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: Re=\r\n: [vedic-wisdom] Freewill.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Narasimhaji&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; No doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail for all of us, however, I cou=\r\nld not help it that an inevitable question popped up in my mind. One of the=\r\n oft discussed and eternal questions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If events have alrea=\r\ndy been created like in a movie and later as time unfolds, they happen in o=\r\nur plane of existence, then all talk of freewill must be humbug?

Bu=\r\nt then if the Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our texts say - then such =\r\na self correcting option is already negated out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Well, the=\r\noritically, in a very large viewpoint no one has any choice in the sense th=\r\nat finally everyone will end up merging with the divine.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; S=\r\no I guess freewill is not really as free as we love to think.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The upsurge (of consciousnes=\r\ns) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Tue, 30/6/09, Narasimh=\r\na PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao\n =\r\n&lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Miscellany: Future, bestest=\r\n homam, purity and overcoming ego&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mai=\r\nl.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank=\r\n rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wis=\r\ndom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Tuesday, 30 June, 2009, 6:01 AM&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I mentioned an episode of =\r\na small boy who did a very short Chandi homam and saw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnat=\r\nions above the fire in the following mail:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ g=\r\nroup/vedic- wisdom/message/ 761&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This boy was born and brou=\r\nght up in US and is not proficient in his knowledge of Hinduism. He did not=\r\n know much about some of the ten incarnations. He described what he saw and=\r\n I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the forms he saw wa=\r\ns a\n radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I=\r\n told him he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when =\r\nI was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This wa=\r\ns abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; I asked what he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not that the future that i=\r\ns to come has not already happened. It has already happened in reality, but=\r\n it will happen later when the time comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I guessed=\r\n what he was getting at, but pretended not to know. I said, &quot;no. What do yo=\r\nu mean?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am think=\r\ning.&quot; This boy is not known to be overly intelligent or articulate. His mai=\r\nn characteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, cont=\r\nented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But he could\n not =\r\nexpress himself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that fu=\r\nture has already happened at some level, but will reveal itself to people l=\r\nater? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in =\r\na studio. Some people may have already seen it. But people seeing it on the=\r\n screen later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you saying s=\r\nomething like that?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what =\r\nI am saying. If something is going to happen in future, it will happen when=\r\n future comes. But somebody may be able to see it before future comes, beca=\r\nuse it has already happened.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though he did not mention it=\r\n, I knew why he was thinking along these lines. When I told him the man rid=\r\ning the horse in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come,=\r\n he was probably confused. Given his age and ability to think and understan=\r\nd things, this probably seemed like an oddity to him that he\n should see so=\r\nmebody who had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible =\r\nand came to some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Time seems linear at the level of regular consciousness. However,=\r\n in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It =\r\neven loses its meaning when one is established in non-dual Aatman or Brahma=\r\nn or Self.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The same boy once perfor=\r\nmed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali wi=\r\nth beejaakshara added before name. When we were meditating after poornaahut=\r\ni, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It was quite different from t=\r\nhe energy I feel normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied =\r\nand blissful and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am =\r\ndone here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire =\r\nconsciousnss.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I had experienced the\n same kind of intense =\r\nenergy twice before that. Once I experienced the same energy when I was med=\r\nitating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in Indi=\r\na. Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside =\r\nthe garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Ka=\r\nali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the=\r\n past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three occasions. At no oth=\r\ner time did I feel that intense shakti.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Interestingly, aft=\r\ner we finished meditation and opened eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out of all t=\r\nhe different homas I did so far, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him wh=\r\ny. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it, but it just felt awesome and diffe=\r\nrent.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This boy performed a really =\r\nsimple and short procedure, shorter than what I give in manuals. But it see=\r\nmed like he was successful in making a\n powerful energy manifest there. The=\r\n bottomline is that internal purity is the most important thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better and =\r\nget more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep do=\r\ning it until one breaks through.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Keep performing your chos=\r\nen spiritual practices, but do pay attention to internal purity as you enga=\r\nge in external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress=\r\n and purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you ca=\r\nn resist attraction to external things better and you can resist internal e=\r\nnemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma better.=\r\n Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of =\r\nall problems.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Overcoming ego using =\r\njnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think tha=\r\nt all that is around you -\n including your house, money, cars, spouse, chil=\r\ndren and your own body - is god&#39;s property and that you are a temporary car=\r\netaker of all of these properties of god. Do the best job you can, but with=\r\nout entertaining the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very g=\r\nood care of his master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all those thin=\r\ngs as his or her belongings.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Realize that thinking of thin=\r\ngs as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for taking good care of them. A servant who l=\r\noves one&#39;s master takes the best care of things entrusted to one. When a th=\r\ning is taken away, a servant does not waste time worrying and crying. A ser=\r\nvant will accept that is master&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. T=\r\nhis enables one to do the best job with what one possesses and not worry ab=\r\nout what one does not possess or what is out of one&#39;s control.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Developing the attitude of a servant who takes care of master&#39;s proper=\r\nties will help one\n wade the ocean of worldly life without getting caught a=\r\nnd overcome ego.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -=\r\n----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do =\r\na Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Ta=\r\nrpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnof=\r\nollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;=\r\n/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath=\r\n.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n -&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n   =\r\n   &lt;!--3--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; See the Web&#39;s breaking stories, chosen by=\r\n people like you.
