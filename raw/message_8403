Even so called Vedic Sadhanas are =\r\noften done for material gains. Recall how most of the Sanskrit stotras of v=\r\narious deities contain a phalastuti (the expected results), is that not mat=\r\nerial gain? Doing a Mahamrityunjaya Mantra for health benefits, isn&#39;t that =\r\na material gain? It is not the path, but the attitude of the sadhaka which =\r\ndetermines for what he/she is performing a certain sadhana. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; Yogis and/or those who do sadhana using &#39;Vedic&#39; tools also acquire siddh=\r\nis. Yogis acquire siddhis, which can come as a byproduct of the path. The p=\r\nroblem is not with siddhis per se, it is with misusing them or commercializ=\r\ning them or hanging on to them. Any sadhaka who can gain a siddhi, can also=\r\n let go of that siddhi whenever he/she wants. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Speaking of=\r\n Karma, everything has a karma of it&#39;s own. Tantra, as it stands today, is =\r\nroughly divided into two major geographic and philosophical demarcations. T=\r\nhe style practiced in South India - mostly Dakshina Margi - and that practi=\r\nced in Bengal and adjacent areas - mostly Vama Margi. In my personal opinio=\r\nn, the adherents of the path in both cases, generally speaking, have been t=\r\nrapped in two delusions born out of collateral byproducts of their respecti=\r\nve paths. The first step of Shakti sadhana is generating shakti. Second ste=\r\np is holding the shakti. Third step is channeling the shakti. In view of th=\r\nis, one school of Tantra that is prevalent today has tied itself up in too =\r\nmuch of technicalities, such that on an average they forget to capture shak=\r\nti (here shakti means energy, not Shakti the supreme Goddess). WHile the ot=\r\nher school is able to generate and hold shakti much better, only to commerc=\r\nialize the same and/or misuse it (generally=C2=A0\n&gt;  speaking, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =\r\nexpcetions are there too). End result, both eventually do not end up produc=\r\ning enough genuine Tantrik saints. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &lt;&lt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; i am wondering &quot;if =\r\nat all&quot; and &quot;what kind&quot; of karmic liabilities one might be getting into ?&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; A fair exchange is never a robbery, as Vimalananda says.

Further, the so called div=\r\nision between &#39;classical Tantra&#39; and &#39;folk Tantra&#39; is not as sharp and clea=\r\nr as it is made out there.
