For the last\n&gt; couple of years, I have witne=\r\nssed a gradual yet strong inclination\n&gt; towards spirituality, religion, rit=\r\nuals, yoga, ayurveda and jyotish. I\n&gt; have been reading a lot about them, m=\r\nostly via the internet, some\n&gt; readings more helpful than others, but each =\r\ndrawing me closer towards\n&gt; learning more and understanding better. A lot o=\r\nf what I read here, in\n&gt; this yahoo-group, is one of the most lucid explana=\r\ntion of spirituality,\n&gt; and the final goal of every saadhana, and the link =\r\nbetween spirituality\n&gt; and rituals, yoga, ayurveda, and leading a simple an=\r\nd humble life.\n&gt; \n&gt; Read the books by Dr Robert E Svoboda on any of the abo=\r\nve topics, they\n&gt; will help you. Start with Aghora 1\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have down=\r\nloaded the book compiled from your writings on spiritual\n&gt; matters and I am=\r\n in the process of reading that as well, and derive\n&gt; great happiness in re=\r\nading it. I also visited your website and saw a\n&gt; wealth of material for sp=\r\niritually inclined people there. The manuals on\n&gt; do-it-yourself homams are=\r\n one of your outstanding contributions to\n&gt; society, and shine brightly amo=\r\nng the other gems of your contributions.\n&gt; I feel an inclination towards pe=\r\nrforming homams on a daily/weekly basis.\n&gt; Before I start this, I want to s=\r\neek your guidance on the following:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. Do I need to prepare myself =\r\nin any way before I start the homam?- I\n&gt; will explain to you what I mean h=\r\nere - since you have suggested that one\n&gt; start with MahaGanapathi homam, I=\r\n shall start with it too. However, as I\n&gt; have been worshipping DeviMa ever=\r\ny morning and Hanumanji every evening,\n&gt; do I need to start worshipping Mah=\r\naGanapathi now for a few days during\n&gt; mornings and evenings and then after=\r\n a few days, start with the homam?\n&gt; \n&gt; Vipin ji, the energy that you are p=\r\nlanning to worship is  no different\n&gt; from the one that you already are wor=\r\nshiping. So don&#39;t worry. When you\n&gt; read the Atharva Sheersham, understand =\r\nthe meaning, that forms are\n&gt; different , the energy is the same. The energ=\r\ny expresses itself\n&gt; differently with each form, but the source remains the=\r\n same. Our mind\n&gt; perceives things as differently. It goes on tangents like=\r\n &quot;if i worship\n&gt; this form, will the other one get offended?&quot; All that is a=\r\n convolution.\n&gt; Just start the homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. Related to the first que=\r\nstion, as I have been worshipping DeviMa\n&gt; for quite sometime now, I see/vi=\r\nsualize Her many times during the day\n&gt; (at work/home), so now when I start=\r\n with the MahaGanapathi homam with\n&gt; complete faith, devotion, and surrende=\r\nr to MahaGanapathi, wouldn&#39;t there\n&gt; be a conflict in my mind, since I may =\r\nstill be visualizing DeviMa\n&gt; everywhere around me (due to mind&#39;s condition=\r\ning), while I am\n&gt; worshipping MahaGanapathi as the One who is the source, =\r\ncradle and end\n&gt; of everything, and hence shoule be visualizing Him instead=\r\n? This may be\n&gt; a hypothetical situation, as I am talking about the future,=\r\n however, may\n&gt; still be relevant, and so I seek your advice here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ref=\r\ner to the above reply.\n&gt; Devi Ma is no different , Infact she will help you=\r\n. Take Ganpathi ji as\n&gt; one of her aspects and vice- a - versa and ask her =\r\nto guide you, and she\n&gt; will. If you sincerely surrender, your questions wi=\r\nll cease to exist\n&gt; soon. Bete, devi ma aur ganeshi mein farak sirf tumhare=\r\n dimaag mein\n&gt; hain.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3. As I am householder, and we are expecting o=\r\nur first child in the\n&gt; next few months, is it ok to perform a homam at hom=\r\ne? It may sound\n&gt; jouvenile but I don&#39;t know any better, and would rather l=\r\nisten to wiser\n&gt; men. The reason I ask this is that while doing the homam, =\r\nwe chant\n&gt; various mantras/stotras, and they produce effects in the immedia=\r\nte\n&gt; environment, specially in the presence of Agni, the Pavaka. Although,\n=\r\n&gt; the goal of my saadhana is to decondition my mimd to move towards\n&gt; great=\r\ner purity, humility and peace, and I have faith that a regular\n&gt; homam will=\r\n enable me to achieve that. However, for the sake of my wife\n&gt; and our chil=\r\nd (inside her womb), I am prompted to ask this question.\n&gt; Please don&#39;t tak=\r\ne it in any other way except as a genuine concern for my\n&gt; family (however =\r\nsilly it is)\n&gt; \n&gt; In two words, I&#39;ll provide you the answer to that.\n&gt; \n&gt; N=\r\no Problem\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4. Related to the above question, if it is fine for me to =\r\ndo the homam\n&gt; at home, then can my pregnant wife also participate in it, i=\r\nf she wants\n&gt; to?\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, if she is comfortable. You are not doing a ritu=\r\nal for destruction,\n&gt; what harm can a little worship bring?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5. Shoul=\r\nd I wait for an auspicious day like an amavasya or an eclipse\n&gt; to start th=\r\ne homam, or is any day fine? Similarly, should I do the homam\n&gt; at a partic=\r\nular time every day or is any time fine? I do understand that\n&gt; doing the h=\r\nomam/any saadhana at the same time everyday, whatever time\n&gt; one does it, i=\r\ns more beneficial than doing it at different times.\n&gt;   Just start, start t=\r\noday, start tomorrow, let eclipses handle\n&gt; themselves, you handle yourself=\r\n. Forget what is beneficial, what will be\n&gt; more profitable and more gainfu=\r\nl, just start, rest of the instructions\n&gt; ganpathi ji will provide.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n6. Is it better to do the homam at home or can it be done elsewhere as\n&gt; we=\r\nll? The reason I ask this is we are living in a rented accomodation\n&gt; and t=\r\nhe smoke from the homam may blacken the walls and the ceiling.\n&gt; However, i=\r\nn our residential/apartment complex, there is a common area,\n&gt; which is ope=\r\nn on two sides, where some community festivals are\n&gt; celebrated together, a=\r\nnd if I get the permission, then maybe I can do\n&gt; the homam there? Is there=\r\n a strong reason/added benefit to doing the\n&gt; homam at home?\n&gt; \n&gt; If there =\r\nis a backyard do it there, if there is a terrace do it there,\n&gt; if you are =\r\ndoing it in the house, do it near a window to help the smoke\n&gt; along. Regar=\r\nding your added benefit clause, are you doing a homam for\n&gt; benefits or to =\r\ncelebrate/worship Ganpathi ji?\n&gt; Forget maximum benefits, start with any be=\r\nnefit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasimhaji, I will be very grateful to you for your answers=\r\n to the\n&gt; above questions.\n&gt; Oh yaar tu shuru toh kar, sawaal baad mein kar=\r\niyo.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You are rendering a great service to today&#39;s society and we pr=\r\nay to\n&gt; DeviMa to keep showing you the way.\n&gt; Yes indeed he and his Guru is=\r\n, but like he would say forget me and say\n&gt; Devima zindabaad!!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Than=\r\nk you for sharing so much!\n&gt; Yay!!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Humble regards,\n&gt; &gt; Vipin\n&gt; Wooh=\r\noo\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; Nobody\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
