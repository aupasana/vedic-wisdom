Is it ok to perform homam in a new place? What =\r\nI mean is Sir was mentioning that homam has to be done at the same time and=\r\n same location everyday. So is new location fine?\n\nNarsimha sir, the other =\r\nday I was in store and saw a table of height two feet.Would the table be an=\r\n appropriate height for placing the havan kunda if one decides to do homa i=\r\nn a table and chair? If No then can you please give exact specifications?\n\n=\r\nI have two yantras and an idol in which pranpratishta has been done. The ho=\r\nuse will be empty and no one will be there to take care of it. So will it b=\r\ne ok to carry them along and pray at my mothers place. My mother says that =\r\nonce prana pratishta is done idols and yantras shouldn&#39;t be moved. \n\nThere =\r\nare some birth habits which I find very hard to let go, how to fight them.W=\r\nhen I get angry I start using some abusive words which I later regret how t=\r\no fight them. Does anyone know of any nice discourses in youtube or good ti=\r\nps which can help in fighting anger. \n\nThanks and regards,\nPriya\n\n\n"}}
