Do not all the holy books advocate\nrenunciation?\n\nMaharshi: Samsara i=\r\ns only in your mind. The world does not speak out, saying\n=91I am the world=\r\n=92. Otherwise, it must be ever there - not excluding your\nsleep. Since it =\r\nis not in sleep it is impermanent. Being impermanent it has\nno stamina. Hav=\r\ning no stamina it is easily subdued by the Self. The Self\nalone is permanen=\r\nt.Renunciation is non-identification of the Self with the\nnon-self. On the =\r\ndisappearance of ignorance the non-self ceases to exist.\nThat is true renun=\r\nciation.\n\nD.Why did you then leave your home in your youth?\n\nMaharshi:That =\r\nis my prarabdha (fate). One=92s course of conduct in this life\nis determine=\r\nd by one=92s prarabdha. My prarabdha is this way. Your prarabdha\nis that wa=\r\ny.\n\nD. Should I not also renounce?\n\nMaharshi: If that had been your prarabd=\r\nha, the question would not have\narisen.\n\nD. I should therefore remain in th=\r\ne world and engage in spiritual practice.\nWell, can I get realisation in th=\r\nis life?\n\nMaharshi: This has been already answered.
