The idea is that one is not bound by Maayaa once=\r\n one *fully* understands \nand appreciates it.\n \nChandipath consists of symb=\r\nolic stories of wars \nthat the divine Mother fought, which explain how one =\r\ncan fight and overcome \nvarious weaknesses that typically bind one in Maaya=\r\na. Reciting these stories on \na regular basis will promote the fighting spi=\r\nrit within one that fights these \nweaknesses.\n \nThere is nothing wrong in u=\r\nnderstanding Maayaa and \ntrying to fight/overcome it at the same time. One =\r\naspect of the Mother creates \nMaayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you ex=\r\nperience good and bad in that \nMaayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you u=\r\nnderstand Maayaa to overcome it. One \naspect of the Mother makes you fight =\r\nand overcome it. When one realizes Self at \nthe end, irrespective of the pa=\r\nth taken, one finally sees that all these are \naspects of a Single Mother w=\r\nho is also essentially true Self.\n \n*        \n*        *\n \n&gt; Also, I have s=\r\ntarted to read the Aghora series \nbooks by Dr. Robert\n&gt; Svobodha. For now I=\r\n have very mixed feelings \non the subject.\n&gt; Perhaps I need to read more! \n=\r\n \nAghora series books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora \nis not everyone&#39;s cu=\r\np of tea. It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n \nGhora means terrible. Agho=\r\nra means &quot;not terrible&quot;. \nOne of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true =\r\nAghora (aghori) does not \nsee anything as terrible or bad or impure and see=\r\ns all as impermanent \nmanifestations of god and tries to focus the thinking=\r\n of the mind on what is \npermanent (god) always, instead of impermanent man=\r\nifestations of \ngod.\n \nWhen someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam \n=\r\nsatya hai&quot; while carrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the =\r\nname \nof Lord Rama is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is=\r\n to remind \noneself that life and death are just a temporary illusion and o=\r\nnly the Lord is \nreal. But the question is: why should we remind ourselves =\r\nof this ultimate truth \nonly when someone dies? When someone praises us for=\r\n a supposedly great thing we \nhave done and we are about to feel proud and =\r\nhappy, can&#39;t we tell ourselves \n&quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did an=\r\nd the praises are temporary \nillusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind=\r\n not dwell on temporary \nillusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something be=\r\nautiful and want to get it, \ncan&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai.=\r\n This thing that seems beautiful \nand other things that seem not so beautif=\r\nul are temporary illusions. Only the \nLord is real. Let the mind not dwell =\r\non temporary illusions&quot;? When someone \nattacks and abuses us and we are abo=\r\nut to feel sad or angry, can&#39;t we tell \nourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. Th=\r\nese abuses are temporary illusions. Only the \nLord is real. Let the mind no=\r\nt dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n \nA true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam=\r\n satya hai&quot; \nalways. His mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of L=\r\nord (instead of \n*dwelling* on them by classifying them as pure and impure,=\r\n good and bad etc and \nthinking about them with attraction/aversion ) and t=\r\nries to find and focus on \nwhat is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n=\r\n \n*        \n*        *\n \nVedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive=\r\n \nis an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are=\r\n both \nimpermenant illusions and the only permanent reality within them is =\r\nthe Self, he \nquestions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a=\r\n ritual where feces \nis eaten. But, please remember that eating \nfeces is n=\r\not the main point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not \nperc=\r\neiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main=\r\n \npoint. For example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such=\r\n a \nperson&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;fe=\r\nces&quot;) \nwhile eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mi=\r\nnd will not \nbe dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain=\r\n properties and \nwill not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking tha=\r\nt he is Self and he is \neating Self.\n \nOf course, a vedantin also has the s=\r\name notions \nreally. He chants vedic verses when eating food, which essenti=\r\nally mean &quot;I am \nSelf and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting=\r\n may merely be a \nritual and not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he=\r\n eats, his mind may \ndwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a ta=\r\nsty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly \ncooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) =\r\nand waver from the focus on \nthe permanent (Self).\n \nThus, a vedantin and a=\r\nn aghora are telling \nthemselves the same truth and trying to absorb that t=\r\nruth into every thought and \nimpulse. But aghora is putting himself in an e=\r\nxtreme situation where failure \nresults in a very bad dual experience. That=\r\n can in fact work as an incentive in \nforcing one to transcend duality! In =\r\nthe case of a person who chants a Vedic \nverse that says &quot;I am Self and I a=\r\nm consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and \nnicely made food, the fallout =\r\nfrom failing to absorb the mind in Self while \neating is not too bad. If th=\r\ne mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) \ntaste of a laddu or other =\r\nfood, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the \nmind fails to absorb=\r\n in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so \ndisgusting. Thus,=\r\n the fact that failure results in a very bad dual experience \nmay act as an=\r\n incentive in succeeding quickly.\n \nHowever, difficult tasks cannot necessa=\r\nrily be \naccomplished by everyone merely because of an incentive. Not every=\r\none trying \nAghora sadhanas succeeds.\n \n*        \n*        *\n \nTake another=\r\n simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, \nlike japam and=\r\n homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is \ndwelling =\r\non sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is \ncau=\r\nsing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n \nA regular person will try to enfor=\r\nce celibacy and keep the mind away from \nsexual thoughts. But that is nor a=\r\n formula for overcoming such thoughts. After \nall, such thoughts may still =\r\ncome and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy \nfor 10 years, there is n=\r\no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does not \nreturn to bite one a=\r\nfter that. But, how to overcome the fascination some minds \nmay have for se=\r\nx?\n \nAn aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root caus=\r\ne and \nremove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex=\r\n as two \ndifferent activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combi=\r\nne them into \none without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an a=\r\nghora sits naked \nwith his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does h=\r\nis japam. In the \nbeginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may t=\r\nhink that his sadhana \nis being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do=\r\n japam like that for several \nmonths/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogr=\r\nammed. He may no longer feel that \nhe is doing something impure. He may no =\r\nlonger feel titillation. The association \nin his mind between nakedness and=\r\n sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures \nphysically or mentally may =\r\nno longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts \nof meditation. Any sma=\r\nll thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head \nmay not lead to =\r\ndenser and denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in \nsadhana, but=\r\n they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so \nmuch tim=\r\ne in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and \nthrill =\r\nmind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the \np=\r\nerson&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.\n \nMind has a =\r\nlot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the thoughts \nwe are exp=\r\nosed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of these structures \nby =\r\nengaging in certain practices that undermine those structures.\n \nHowever, i=\r\ns this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible that \nthe perso=\r\nn keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex \nevery=\r\ntime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he=\r\n \nsees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with.=\r\n\n \n*        \n*        *\n Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and we=\r\naknesses head \non and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a norm=\r\nal person may push \nthe problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with=\r\n low stakes. Such a risky \nstrategy is not applicable to all.\n \n*        \n*=\r\n        *\n Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and what \ni=\r\ns Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to understand and absorb Vedant=\r\na in \none&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan. However,=\r\n it is \ncertainly not suitable for all and many may feel aversion. More dan=\r\ngerously, \nsome people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong understa=\r\nnding and the \nthrill such an understanding brings. Aghora stands for neith=\r\ner thrills nor \nperversion, though it *may* attract some people pursuing th=\r\nrills and/or \nperversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads=\r\n are the same, but \nAghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the truth i=\r\nnto one&#39;s thinking by \nmaking failure very unpleasant.\n \nBTW, the following=\r\n mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths \nand explains the ba=\r\nsic reality. It may be interesting to read in the context of \naghora.\n \nhtt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 361\n Best \nregards,\nNar=\r\nasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- -\n  \nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;D=\r\no It \nYourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri \nTarpana:\n        =\r\n          http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n     Films that make a difference=\r\n: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ g=\r\nroup/vedic- wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/Jyot=\r\nishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- -\n \n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;From: Nagraj Kota \n&gt;To: vedic=\r\n-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 18, 2010 11:58 \n&gt;  AM\n=\r\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi \n&gt;  Homam and Sri Vidya\n&gt; \n&gt;Dear Na=\r\nrasimhagaru,\n&gt; \n&gt;Thank you for your reply. \n&gt; \n&gt;I understand that Chandi an=\r\nd Lalita are two different forms of the \n&gt;        Universal Mother. But wha=\r\nt I am trying to understand is that \n&gt;        how to worship both forms sim=\r\nultaneously. For instance, Sri \n&gt;        Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a gre=\r\nat composer (one of the Divine Trinity \n&gt;        of Carnatic Music along wi=\r\nth Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who was a \n&gt;        self-realized Sri Vid=\r\nyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna \n&gt;        Krithis mention great details a=\r\nbout all the nine avaranas \n&gt;        and different forms of the divine moth=\r\ner as one goes through each \n&gt;        avarana. In the Dhyana Krithi of thos=\r\ne, in the very first \n&gt;        line he says, &#39;Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatik=\r\ne, ChanDike&#39;. That line \n&gt;        tells me that even through Sri Vidya one =\r\ncan worship Chandi Ma, in \n&gt;        that form. \n&gt; \n&gt;So my question was in t=\r\nhat perspective. Anyway, your reply was a \n&gt;        great one in which you =\r\nmentioned how the Self is surrounded by layers of \n&gt;        duality! I neve=\r\nr thought in those terms. \n&gt; \n&gt;I have started reading Durga Saptashati, jus=\r\nt to get practise of \n&gt;        reading it fluently, before I start to do ch=\r\nandi homam, which I plan to \n&gt;        do during navaratri of 2010. I really=\r\n cannot wait to get comfortable \n&gt;        reading the saptashati! Have to s=\r\nee how mother will help me achieve my \n&gt;        target. \n&gt; \n&gt;Also, I have s=\r\ntarted to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert \n&gt;        Svobodha. Fo=\r\nr now I have very mixed feelings on the subject. Perhaps I \n&gt;        need t=\r\no read more! \n&gt; \n&gt;Nagraj\n&gt;\n&gt;--- On Fri, 2/12/10, \n&gt;        Narasimha PVR Ra=\r\no &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; &gt;        wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;From: Narasimha PVR Rao \n&gt;&gt;     =\r\n     &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi \n&gt;&gt;          H=\r\nomam and Sri Vidya\n&gt;&gt;To: \n&gt;&gt;          vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt;&gt;Date=\r\n: Friday, February 12, \n&gt;&gt;          2010, 11:31 PM\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;  \n&gt;&gt;Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;Sanskrit is almost like a mother tongue to me. My \n&gt;&gt;          performin=\r\ng a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspiring. On \n&gt;&gt;          t=\r\nhe other hand, there are some people who do not know Sanskrit at all \n&gt;&gt;   =\r\n       and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great difficulty in their \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;          first attempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it take=\r\ns them \n&gt;&gt;          1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-inspiring.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Integrating =\r\nvarious \n&gt;&gt;          sadhanas is a personal problem that needs a personal s=\r\nolution. In \n&gt;&gt;          general, it is a good idea to pick one or two sadh=\r\nanas and maximize \n&gt;&gt;          the time spent on them, instead of splitting=\r\n the time between ten \n&gt;&gt;          things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said,=\r\n it is better to dig 10 metres \n&gt;&gt;          in one place rather than dig on=\r\ne metre in ten places, if one wants to \n&gt;&gt;          find water.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;One po=\r\nssibility is to do a homam and then meditate \n&gt;&gt;          at the end after =\r\npoornaahuti with various mantras one is attached \n&gt;&gt;          to.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;I am=\r\n not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, from \n&gt;&gt;          the lit=\r\ntle I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic \n&gt;&gt;          represent=\r\nation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, \n&gt;&gt;          =\r\ntoo, is to unravel the layer of duality and realize \n&gt;&gt;          Self.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;Lalita means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. \n&gt;&gt;          If y=\r\nou have a mother who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly.

You also wrote that \n&gt;&gt;    =\r\n      it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;          can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short ti=\r\nme? \n&gt;&gt;          Also, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (2=\r\n0 \n&gt;&gt;          minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a sho=\r\nrt rudra \n&gt;&gt;          Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-1=\r\n0 minutes) \n&gt;&gt;          totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual.

A true&nbsp;Aghora (aghori) does not \nsee anything as terribl=\r\ne or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent \nmanifestations of god and t=\r\nries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is \npermanent (god) always, =\r\ninstead of impermanent manifestations of \ngod.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=\r\n=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D=\r\n&quot;2&quot;&gt;When someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam \nsatya hai&quot; while ca=\r\nrrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name \nof Lord Rama =\r\nis true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind \noneself=\r\n that life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is \nre=\r\nal. But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate tr=\r\nuth \nonly when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great=\r\n thing we \nhave done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tel=\r\nl ourselves \n&quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are t=\r\nemporary \nillusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on tempo=\r\nrary \nillusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want to=\r\n get it, \ncan&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that se=\r\nems beautiful \nand other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary il=\r\nlusions. Only the \nLord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusi=\r\nons&quot;? When someone \nattacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or a=\r\nngry, can&#39;t we tell \nourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are temp=\r\norary illusions.

His mind rejects all *impermanent manifesta=\r\ntions* of Lord (instead of \n*dwelling* on them by classifying them as pure =\r\nand impure, good and bad etc and \nthinking about them with attraction/avers=\r\nion ) and tries to find and focus on \nwhat is permanent. But he takes it to=\r\n extremes.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Ar=\r\nial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive \nis an i=\r\nllusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both \nim=\r\npermenant illusions and the only permanent reality within them is the Self,=\r\n he \nquestions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual w=\r\nhere feces \nis eaten.&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;But, plea=\r\nse remember that eating \nfeces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in th=\r\ne food being consumed and not \nperceiving an impermanent manifestation of S=\r\nelf (feces, fruit etc), is the main \npoint. For example, eating feces with =\r\ndisgust serves no purpose, for such a \nperson&#39;s mind is dwelling on the imp=\r\nermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) \nwhile eating it. A successful Agh=\r\nora may be eating feces, but the mind will not \nbe dwelling on the fact tha=\r\nt he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and \nwill not feel any kind =\r\nof disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and he is \neating Self.&lt;/fo=\r\nnt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;fo=\r\nnt face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Of course, a vedantin also has the same notion=\r\ns \nreally. He chants vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean =\r\n&quot;I am \nSelf and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merel=\r\ny be a \nritual and not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his=\r\n mind may \ndwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;=\r\n, &quot;a badly \ncooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver =\r\nfrom the focus on \nthe permanent (Self).&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Ar=\r\nial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Th=\r\nus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling \nthemselves the same truth and try=\r\ning to absorb that truth into every thought and \nimpulse. But aghora is put=\r\nting himself in an extreme situation where failure \nresults in a very bad d=\r\nual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in \nforcing one to tr=\r\nanscend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic \nverse that say=\r\ns &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and \nnicely mad=\r\ne food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while \neating i=\r\ns not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) \ntaste =\r\nof a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the \n=\r\nmind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be s=\r\no \ndisgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual exper=\r\nience \nmay act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;fo=\r\nnt face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; =\r\nsize=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be \naccomplished by =\r\neveryone merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying \nAghora sadhan=\r\nas succeeds.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; siz=\r\ne=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Take another si=\r\nmple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, \nlike japam and ho=\r\nmam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is \ndwelling on =\r\nsex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is \ncausin=\r\ng guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;A regular =\r\nperson will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away from \nsexual tho=\r\nughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts. After \nall, =\r\nsuch thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy \n=\r\nfor 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does n=\r\not \nreturn to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fascination som=\r\ne minds \nmay have for sex?&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;An aghora will take=\r\n it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and \nremove fascinatio=\r\nn from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two \ndifferent activ=\r\nities (one pure and the other impure), he may combine them into \none withou=\r\nt such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked \nwith h=\r\nis partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam. In the \nbeginn=\r\ning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think that his sadhana \ni=\r\ns being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like that for sev=\r\neral \nmonths/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer =\r\nfeel that \nhe is doing something impure. He may no longer feel titillation.=\r\n The association \nin his mind between nakedness and sex may be broken down.=\r\n Seeing naked pictures \nphysically or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts=\r\n of sex, but evoke thoughts \nof meditation. Any small thoughts related to s=\r\nex that suddenly rise in the head \nmay not lead to denser and denser though=\r\nts relating to sex and distraction in \nsadhana, but they may now take the m=\r\nind back to meditation. After spending so \nmuch time in meditation while si=\r\ntting naked intimately, the attraction and \nthrill mind may feel for nakedn=\r\ness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the \nperson&#39;s fascination and =\r\nweakness for sex may be gone largely.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Mind has=\r\n a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the thoughts \nwe are =\r\nexposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of these structures \n=\r\nby engaging in certain practices that undermine those structures.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is=\r\n also possible that \nthe person keeps on engaging in the practice merely fo=\r\nr sex and thinks of sex \neverytime he sits for meditation (instead of think=\r\ning of meditation everytime he \nsees naked partner), if one was not serious=\r\n/sincere/ ready to start with.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;Bottom=\r\nline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head \non and sets up a=\r\n high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may push \nthe problem=\r\ns under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky \nstra=\r\ntegy is not applicable to all.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what =\r\nis Vedanta and what \nis Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to unders=\r\ntand and absorb Vedanta in \none&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high sta=\r\nkes war plan. However, it is \ncertainly not suitable for all and many may f=\r\neel aversion. More dangerously, \nsome people may feel attraction for it bas=\r\ned on a wrong understanding and the \nthrill such an understanding brings.&n=\r\nbsp;Aghora stands for neither thrills nor \nperversion, though it *may* attr=\r\nact some people pursuing thrills and/or \nperversion. The basic tenets of Ag=\r\nhora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but \nAghora tries to accelerates =\r\nhow one absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by \nmaking failure very unple=\r\nasant.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;BTW, the following mail gives a good an=\r\nalogy for various spiritual paths \nand explains the basic reality.

For&nbsp;instance, Sri \n       =\r\n Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great composer (one of the Divine Trinity \n=\r\n        of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who was=\r\n a \n        self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna \n       =\r\n Krithis&nbsp;mention&nbsp;great details about all the&nbsp;nine avaranas \n=\r\n        and different forms of the divine mother as one goes through each \n=\r\n        avarana.&nbsp;In the Dhyana Krithi&nbsp;of those, in the very&nbsp;=\r\nfirst \n        line he says, &#39;Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;.&nb=\r\nsp;That line \n        tells me that&nbsp;even through Sri Vidya one can wor=\r\nship Chandi Ma, in \n        that form.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=\r\n=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;So my question was in that pers=\r\npective. Anyway, your reply was a \n        great one in which you mentioned=\r\n how the Self is surrounded by layers of \n        duality! I never thought =\r\nin those terms. &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;I have started reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practis=\r\ne of \n        reading it fluently, before I start to do chandi homam, which=\r\n I plan to \n        do during navaratri of 2010. I really cannot wait to ge=\r\nt comfortable \n        reading the saptashati! Have to see how mother will =\r\nhelp me achieve my \n        target. &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Also, I have started to read the Aghora =\r\nseries books by Dr. Robert \n        Svobodha. For now I have very mixed fee=\r\nlings on the subject. Perhaps I \n        need to read more! &lt;/div&gt;\n        =\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;Nagraj&lt;/div&gt;\n   =\r\n     &lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=\r\n&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Fri, =\r\n2/12/10, \n        Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;i&gt;&lt;pvr@charter. net&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; \n  =\r\n      wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid =\r\nrgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=\r\n&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: Narasimha PVR Rao \n          &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi \n          Homam and Sri Vidya&lt;br&gt;To: \n=\r\n          vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;br&gt;Date: Friday, February 12, \n   =\r\n       2010, 11:31 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n          &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv540098920&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/span&gt; \n          &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;div&gt;Namaste,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nSanskrit is almost like a mother tongue to me. My \n          performing a C=\r\nhandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspiring. On \n          the othe=\r\nr hand, there are some people who do not know Sanskrit at all \n          an=\r\nd took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great difficulty in their \n         =\r\n first attempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it takes them \n   =\r\n       1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-inspiring.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Integrating various \n  =\r\n        sadhanas is a personal problem that needs a personal solution. In \n=\r\n          general, it is a good idea to pick one or two sadhanas and maximi=\r\nze \n          the time spent on them, instead of splitting the time between=\r\n ten \n          things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better to di=\r\ng 10 metres \n          in one place rather than dig one metre in ten places=\r\n, if one wants to \n          find water.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One possibility is to do a =\r\nhomam and then meditate \n          at the end after poornaahuti with variou=\r\ns mantras one is attached \n          to.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am not that knowledgeable=\r\n about Sri Vidya. However, from \n          the little I have been exposed t=\r\no, Sree chakra is a symblic \n          representation of the layers of dual=\r\nity surrounding Self. Its purpose, \n          too, is to unravel the layer =\r\nof duality and realize \n          Self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lalita means gentle one and =\r\nChandi means the fierce one. \n          If you have a mother who teaches yo=\r\nu gently, you will learn slowly. If \n          you have a mother who is ste=\r\nrn and strict, you will learn fast \n          (provided you can face the st=\r\nrictness). Both are valid \n          paths.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasim=\r\nha&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- \n          --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- -&lt;br&gt;Free Jyotish Software, \n          Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish W=\r\nritings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual \n          manuals for short Homam and =\r\nPitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.=\r\nvedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Films that mak=\r\ne a \n          difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://saraswatifilms.org/&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFil ms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spirituality: &lt;=\r\na rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nvedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n          wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/Jyot=\r\nishWri \n          tings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- \n          --------- -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On Fri, 2/5/10, &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofoll=\r\now&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=\r\n=3Dnagraj%40sbcglobal.net&quot;&gt;nagraj@sbcglobal. net&lt;/a&gt; \n          &lt;&lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/c=\r\nompose?to=3Dnagraj_um%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&lt;/a&gt;&gt; \n          =\r\nwrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://us=\r\n.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dnagraj%40sbcglobal.net&quot;&gt;nagraj@sbcglo=\r\nbal. net&lt;/a&gt; \n          &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dnagraj_um%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;nagraj=\r\n_um@yahoo. \n          com&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Chandi Homam a=\r\nnd Sri \n          Vidya&lt;br&gt;To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ \n          yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Date: Friday, Febr=\r\nuary 5, 2010, 11:51 \n          PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;I am very much in awe \n          after I learnt that you do chandi homam e=\r\nveryday. You also wrote that \n          it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 ho=\r\nurs to do your chandi homam. How \n          can you accomplish that feat wi=\r\nth 700 ahutis in such a short time? \n          Also, in my case, I do sandh=\r\nyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 \n          minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam =\r\n108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra \n          Abhishekam with pachakshari=\r\n, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) \n          totalling to about 35 - 40 =\r\nminutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do \n          special rituals severa=\r\nl times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours \n          in all. How to i=\r\nntegrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana \n          different fr=\r\nom Chandi homam? Could you please explain what is sri \n          Vidya and =\r\nhow it is to be learnt?
