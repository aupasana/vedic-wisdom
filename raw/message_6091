You\n&gt; need to let go of the though=\r\nt that the fire needs constant attention; it\n&gt; will do what it wants to do.=\r\n Try and develop a healthy, respectful and\n&gt; loving relationship with the f=\r\nire. Your situation is not new to me; I&#39;ve\n&gt; faced this quite a few times w=\r\nhere I get tensed about whether the poornahuti\n&gt; will burn or not. Slowly I=\r\n&#39;ve learnt to let go and flow with the situation.\n&gt; If you use a coconut pi=\r\nece as poornahuti, then dip it in ghee before\n&gt; offering...do this immediat=\r\nely after vasordhara...u will see that when\n&gt; vasordharaa starts, the fire =\r\nwill simply leap up as if in anticipation. If\n&gt; you use a half of a dry coc=\r\nonut as poornahuti, then fill that half with\n&gt; ghee, coin, what all you off=\r\nered before and place it carefully in the centre\n&gt; of the havan kund. If yo=\r\nu use a full dry coconut as poornahuti, then before\n&gt; the havan, cut it int=\r\no two parts (where one part is smaller and other is\n&gt; larger), fill the lar=\r\nger part with ghee and other offerings, close the\n&gt; coconut and tie it up w=\r\nith a string or cloth...then keep it ready for\n&gt; offering.\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case=\r\n, let go and delve deep into medidation trusting the fire to do\n&gt; what it w=\r\nill do...then watch the magic unfold!\n&gt; \n&gt; best regards\n&gt; Hari\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue,=\r\n Mar 29, 2011 at 6:28 PM, Jitender Dahiya &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks Utpal and KK for such a prompt reply.\n&gt; &gt; @Ut=\r\npal--But the problem i face is even if there is unburnt coconut in fire\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n i need too add ghee from time to time otherwise that extra ghee added befo=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; meditation goes and gets accumulated in the bottom.\n&gt; &gt; The fire wou=\r\nld go off after 5-7 minutes of starting my mediattion if i dont\n&gt; &gt; give so=\r\nme attentiion to it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; @KK-- as far as i doing another homam as quick=\r\nly is possible, i try to do\n&gt; &gt; that everyday.
