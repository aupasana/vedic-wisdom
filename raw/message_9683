However, i came across an artic=\r\nle saying if i woke up and go out of the mat, the benefit would be transfer=\r\nred to Lord Indra. The article goes like this;\n\nLord Indra worshiped Lord S=\r\nhiva. Pleased with his devotion Lord Shiva appeared and ask Lord Indra to a=\r\nsk for a boon. Lord Indra asked, that let he be blessed to snatch everyone&#39;=\r\ns fruit of bhakti/devotion, because he fear that someone will take over his=\r\n Kingdom by winning a boon from any God.\nLord Shiva persuaded him to ask fo=\r\nr something else, because not everyone is seeking to ousted Lord Indra. Upo=\r\nn his (Lord Indra&#39;s) persistence Lord Shiva and he came upon an agreement, =\r\nthat if anyone, in eternity is sitting doing any devotion, it be Japa, Tarp=\r\nan, Marjan, Homa/Havan, Shradha or any rites, if the person stands up from =\r\nhis asana/mat and leave. Then the fruit or benefit of that ritual or undert=\r\naking will go to Lord Indra.\nBut if the person or devotee puts a drop or tw=\r\no of water underneath the asana/mat and touch this water, with his ring fin=\r\nger puts a tilak or puts a dot of that water on his forehead or between the=\r\n eyebrows, the benefit or fruit of that particular ritual, sadhana or devot=\r\nion will remain with the devotee. Lord Indra will not be able to snatch the=\r\n fruit of that devotion.\nThis simple act keeps the fruit of your devotion w=\r\nith you! No one can snatch the benefit from you, not even Lord Indra.\nThat&#39;=\r\ns why many a times, I have been asked why is that one is praying to God for=\r\n so long with no benefit or fruit of that devotion. Why God is not listenin=\r\ng? Well, when I explain the above story to them, it raises their eyebrows. =\r\nWhen they adopt this simple act, they start seeing results! The benefit or =\r\nfruit of their devotion remain with them, forever!\n\nPlease advise me.\nThank=\r\n You.\n\n\n"}}
