Since\nIslam\nFollowers are killing in front of our eyes we are treating them as\nterrorists etc. What I have written here is 100% true and lots of back\npapers could be \nShown as examples.\nIt is nothing to do with any ism for killing people. There are two kinds of\npeople one is tolerant another is intolerant. That is all. Every religion\nhas these people some are showing up now some showed earlier times.\nHRYAHOO\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com [mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com] On\nBehalf Of Katti Narahari\nSent: 03 July 2013 07:16\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Ney\n\n  \n\nNamaste Svarupa,\n\nIf one particular religion has existed and propagated by the virtue of the\nsword, then should solution be more violence?

Some even accepted and worshiped Hindu deities. Yet, when someone\nspeaks of &quot;Allah&quot;, it elicits this reaction!\n\t\t \n\t\tI do not want to comment on whether this reaction is correct\nor incorrect. After all, everyone acts uniquely based on one&#39;s conditioning\nand cumulative life experiences. Moreover, I am not really a scholar on\nIslam and am not familiar with various interpretations of Quran and other\nscriptures of Islam.\n\t\t \n\t\tBut, all I want to say is that intolerance feeds intolerance\nand love feeds love. You react to someone&#39;s intolerance with further\nintolerance and that will make them react to you with further intolerance.\nAnd so on.
