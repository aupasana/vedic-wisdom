Now it happened so that Mr. VS could not repay it due to reasons only kno=\r\nwn to him. Mr. VS gives many excuses and many dates but fails and ultimatel=\r\ny does not pay back. Mr. FL is under great pressure due to that.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Mr. =\r\nFL can have many options to react in the situations:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1] Thinking const=\r\nantly and repenting for the act He can-\n&gt;    Curse, Constantly follow-up, M=\r\nount Abuses, Remain under stress, resort to other techniques of &#39;Vasuli&#39; an=\r\nd resorts to many Internal and external activities concerning that issue.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; In this case, He strongly identifies with the Money, act of Giving then=\r\n expecting it back, Repenting etc...\n&gt; \n&gt; OR\n&gt; \n&gt; 2] Mr. FL can really grab=\r\n the golden chance to resort to the implementation of knowledge (KIP-Knowle=\r\ndge in Practice) and thinks that it was a Rina which needed to be paid back=\r\n and practically starts training the mind with that knowledge. He follows u=\r\np for the money but with the attitude of detachment. Although he shows to h=\r\nis family and friends that he is extremely concerned and it was foolish act=\r\n etc... But in his mind he thinks that it was a rina from some past life wh=\r\nich was fulfilled. He thinks that they were Money of Mother and she will ta=\r\nke care. If they needed to come back, she will do it or if they were to be =\r\npaid to nullify some past rinas then they will not come back.\n&gt; \n&gt; With the=\r\n Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas and will be abl=\r\ne to break free from this particular chain.

This comes from millions of janmas and samskaras. \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; My spiritual father &quot;Vimalananda&quot; used to say=C2=A0in a slightly differ=\r\nent context that he believes in Sampradaha or incineration.\n&gt; &gt; I applied i=\r\nt to this as well and it works quite well.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Two things=C2=A0are go=\r\ning to be=C2=A0useful, \n&gt; &gt; 1. Continue your mantra during the act and it w=\r\nill act as a continuation of your sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; 2. If your partner is willin=\r\ng, use Shiva lata and do not be disheartened by failure initially. As time =\r\ngoes on, the=C2=A0thing in your mind which thinks of sex is incinerated and=\r\n slowly you find that a naked female(or male as=C2=A0may be the case)=C2=A0=\r\nbody is like a landscape picture just like any other picture made by Her of=\r\n nature(like Niagara falls, or Angkor Wat, you need not be disturbed by it,=\r\n you can certainly=C2=A0feel that the picture=C2=A0is very beautiful=C2=A0b=\r\nut you need not be aroused by it). In fact Striya Samasta Sakala jagatsu, t=\r\nyaikiya.... ...\n&gt; &gt; Once this stage is reached then the mind ceases to thin=\r\nk of sex all the while.\n&gt; &gt; Yes you may still encounter it, but that is ano=\r\nther story.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Manish\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; On Thu, Feb 25, 2010 at 2:24 PM, Narasimha P.V=\r\n.R.

It was during the Shata Chandi homam that Manish had a darshan of=C2=\r\n=A0the Mother, who commanded to=C2=A0spread homam and said She will arrange=\r\n all the resources needed. Swami Sathasivom had several books on homam gift=\r\ned to us by a friend=C2=A0of his on the next day, without Manish telling an=\r\nything about the Mother&#39;s command to anyone.

He has childlike innocence, simplicty,=\r\n rare humility=C2=A0and love for all. He conducts himself with detachment b=\r\ny seeking nothing and avoiding nothing. He conducted some of the best homam=\r\ns and poojas I have witnessed. He has been on mouna vratam (vow of silence)=\r\n for more than a year and communicates by writing (saying mantras in pooja/=\r\nhomam is an exception).\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I ca=\r\nn give an analogy for the last point regarding an aghora&#39;s way to overcome =\r\nany=C2=A0weakness for sex that may be left in the mind (which may make sexu=\r\nal=C2=A0thoughts arise in the mind now and then).\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Suppose yo=\r\nu are trying to read a book and a friend is distracting you and irritating =\r\nyou by talking about something else.

This friend may get=\r\n interested in the book and stop distracting you, or he may continue to dis=\r\ntract you and make it worse by being right next to you through the reading.=\r\n It is tricky to know how long one should try before deciding that it is no=\r\nt working.

It is normal to have mixed fe=\r\nelings.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. O=\r\nne of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C2=A0Aghora (aghori) does n=\r\not see anything as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent ma=\r\nnifestations of god and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is =\r\npermanent (god) always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; When someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; wh=\r\nile carrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord =\r\nRama is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind one=\r\nself that life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is=\r\n real. But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate=\r\n truth only when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly gre=\r\nat thing we have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we te=\r\nll ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are t=\r\nemporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on tempor=\r\nary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want to g=\r\net it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems=\r\n beautiful and other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary illusi=\r\nons. Only the Lord is real.

Let the mind not dwell on temporary i=\r\nllusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya ha=\r\ni&quot; always. His mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (inste=\r\nad of *dwelling* on them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and b=\r\nad etc and thinking about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find=\r\n and focus on what is permanent.

The variety we =\r\nperceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fr=\r\nuit are both impermenant illusions and the only permanent reality within th=\r\nem is the Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may =\r\ntry a ritual where feces is eaten.=C2=A0But, please remember that eating fe=\r\nces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and n=\r\not perceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is t=\r\nhe main point. For example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, fo=\r\nr such a person&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self=\r\n (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but th=\r\ne mind will not be dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with cert=\r\nain properties and will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking t=\r\nhat he is Self and he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Of course, a vedantin =\r\nalso has the same notions really. He chants vedic verses when eating food, =\r\nwhich essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, s=\r\nuch chanting may merely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thin=\r\nking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant manifestations of S=\r\nelf (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty crack=\r\ner&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth and try=\r\ning to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. But aghora is putt=\r\ning himself in an extreme situation where failure results in a very bad dua=\r\nl experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing one to trans=\r\ncend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse that says &quot;I=\r\n am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and nicely made foo=\r\nd, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while eating is not =\r\ntoo bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a la=\r\nddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the mind fai=\r\nls to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so disgus=\r\nting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual experience may=\r\n act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; However, difficu=\r\nlt tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by everyone merely because of a=\r\nn incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose so=\r\nmeone is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a wea=\r\nkness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thou=\r\nghts in the middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s =\r\nsadhana.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and k=\r\neep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overc=\r\noming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract o=\r\nne. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the=\r\n fascination in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But, how t=\r\no overcome the fascination some minds may have for sex?\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; An a=\r\nghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and rem=\r\nove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two di=\r\nfferent activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combine them int=\r\no one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits n=\r\naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam. In =\r\nthe beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think that his =\r\nsadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like tha=\r\nt for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may no=\r\n longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no longer feel titil=\r\nlation. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex may be broken=\r\n down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no longer evoke tho=\r\nughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts related =\r\nto sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to denser and\n&gt; &gt;  dense=\r\nr thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but they may now tak=\r\ne the mind back to meditation. After spending so much time in meditation wh=\r\nile sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind may feel for n=\r\nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s fascination =\r\nand weakness for sex may be gone largely.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of =\r\nconditioning based on prior experiences and the thoughts we are exposed to.=\r\n Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of these structures by engaging =\r\nin certain practices that undermine those structures.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Howeve=\r\nr, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible that the pe=\r\nrson keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex eve=\r\nrytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime =\r\nhe sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0Bottomline is that an agho=\r\nra takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high stakes fight wi=\r\nth them, whereas a normal person may push the problems under the carpet and=\r\n fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is not applicable =\r\nto all.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0Like Manish said in =\r\na mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a pr=\r\nactical way to understand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by s=\r\netting up a high stakes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for=\r\n all and many may feel aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel att=\r\nraction for it based on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an unders=\r\ntanding brings.=C2=A0Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, thou=\r\ngh it *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The bas=\r\nic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries t=\r\no accelerates how one absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failu=\r\nre very unpleasant.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; BTW, the following mail gives a good ana=\r\nlogy for various spiritual paths and explains the basic reality.

For=\r\n=C2=A0instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great composer (one of t=\r\nhe Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry=\r\n), who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis=\r\n=C2=A0mention=C2=A0great details about all the=C2=A0nine avaranas and diffe=\r\nrent forms of the divine mother as one goes through each avarana.=C2=A0In t=\r\nhe Dhyana Krithi=C2=A0of those, in the very=C2=A0first line he says, &#39;Kamal=\r\nambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;.=C2=A0That line tells me that=C2=A0eve=\r\nn through Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; So my question was in that perspective. Anyway, your reply was a gr=\r\neat one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by layers of dual=\r\nity! I never thought in those terms. \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I have started reading=\r\n Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it fluently, before I st=\r\nart to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during navaratri of 2010. I real=\r\nly cannot wait to get comfortable reading the saptashati! Have to see how m=\r\nother will help me achieve my target. \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Also, I have started =\r\nto read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert Svobodha. For now I have very=\r\n mixed feelings on the subject.

THAT is awe-inspiring.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Integrating various sadhana=\r\ns is a personal problem that needs a personal solution. In general, it is a=\r\n good idea to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them,=\r\n instead of splitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramaham=\r\nsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one met=\r\nre in ten places, if one wants to find water.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One possibility is t=\r\no do a homam and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with various ma=\r\nntras one is attached to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vi=\r\ndya. However, from the little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symb=\r\nlic representation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, =\r\ntoo, is to unravel the layer of duality and realize Self.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lalita m=\r\neans gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who t=\r\neaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern=\r\n and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face the strictness).
