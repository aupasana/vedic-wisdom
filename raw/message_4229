You can find some answers in the archives. I will briefly answer again.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; On your first point: Yes, Lord Krishna did indeed say in the 10th cha=\r\npter of BhagavadGita: &quot;yaGYaanaam japayaGYo.asmi&quot; (of all sacrifices/ritual=\r\ns, I am the japa yajna, i.e. chanting of mantras).\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; We can g=\r\net it in right perspective by noting that the very previous line says &quot;I am=\r\n Om among all mantras&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, Om represents the pure and absolute essen=\r\nce of universe. However, is it possible for everyone to meditate just using=\r\n &quot;Om&quot; and reach god? Probably not. Are Krishna devotees leaving other mantr=\r\nas such as the mahamantra (Hare krishna mantra) and doing japam only with &quot;=\r\nOm&quot;, because Krishna said I am &quot;Om&quot; among mantras? Of course, not.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sam=\r\ne thing holds to japam vs other sadhanas such as homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just as one ma=\r\ny need ropes and other gear to climb mount everest, one may need to employ =\r\nmantras other than &quot;Om&quot; and practices other than &quot;japam&quot; to overcome one&#39;s =\r\nshort-comings and reach the summit of the absolute, represented by Om (and =\r\nall other things mentioned by Krishna).\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; When you do an exte=\r\nrnal sacrifical ritual such as homam, your body is engaging in actions. So =\r\nyour mind has to be attached to the body and use it in a particular way. Ca=\r\nn one reach samadhi while doing homam? Unlikely. One is more likely to reac=\r\nh samadhi when one stops the external actions. Mind may be withdrawn comple=\r\ntely from the body and absorb fully in the mantra at some stage then.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nFrom the point of view, japam (sitting still and meditating on a mantra) is=\r\n the ultimate sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, not everyone can reach god like that. =\r\nThere are so many vasanas (conditioning) in the mind that needs to be purge=\r\nd/purified slowly. Until that is done, japam may not help one reach god. Un=\r\ntil then, taking the help of an external pure object (such as fire) that ha=\r\ns a purifying effect on one&#39;s subtle consciousness can be helpful. It *prep=\r\nares* one for good japam.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; A lot of priests do homam and the=\r\nn leave the fire and go away. In the homam manuals, I have made it a point =\r\nto insist that people do japam with their favorite mantra at the end of the=\r\n homam, while sitting still with closed eyes. The idea is that homam purifi=\r\nes subtle consciousness and *prepares* one for reaching god, while it is fi=\r\nnally japam that takes one to god. After every homam, one&#39;s internal purity=\r\n is at a maximum (a local maximum, temporally speaking - sorry for the tech=\r\nnical jargon) and japam will be more fruitful than at other times.\n&gt; \n&gt; * *=\r\n *\n&gt; \n&gt; Now onto other questions:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) It is unfruitful in the sense th=\r\nat it does not take you closer to god. It is fruitful in the sense that it =\r\nstops you from going much further away from god. After all, if you weren&#39;t =\r\nengaged in that japam and you were doing some other activity, probably your=\r\n mind will wander even more.\n&gt; \n&gt; I suggest looking at disturbing thoughts =\r\nin the middle of a japam as a heckler interrupting your speech. Instead of =\r\narguing and fighting with the heckler, simply take note of him, pause for a=\r\n second and move on. Instead of panicking or worrying, simply take note of =\r\nyour thoughts, pause for a second and move on.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) Mantra means that w=\r\nhich protects (tra) the mind (mana). Various vasanas (conditioning) are pul=\r\nling the mind in different directions to react to various situations in var=\r\nious ways and that activity tires out the mind. You protect it by anchoring=\r\n it in a mantra and teaching it to overcome the pulls of vasana.\n&gt; \n&gt; The p=\r\nroof of whether a mantra or japam or homam is working for you or not is whe=\r\nther there is a slow internal transformation in you or not, whether your in=\r\nternal reaction to various external things is changing for the better or no=\r\nt.\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) Difficult. This is where a good guru is helpful.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually,=\r\n in this age, technical perfection is almost ruled out. I suggest doing wha=\r\ntever one does with a sense of surrender and humility. If there is somethin=\r\ng partly correct that somebody is doing, it will slowly increase with time =\r\nand Nature will remove imperfections with time.\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) I can write Obama&#39;=\r\ns name and Gordon&#39;s name on sheets of paper next to me and pretend that the=\r\ny came there and sat there. Will they really do it? On the other hand, if I=\r\n am a world leader holding a summit, probably I can make them actually come=\r\n and sit there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nyasa means placement. When you do nyasa, you place va=\r\nrious vibrations (sound patterns) or energies (deities) in various body par=\r\nts. For most of us with distracted minds, it is merely a formality and mean=\r\ns nothing. Only a sadhaka with a pure, pointed and focused mind can actuall=\r\ny place various vibrations and energies in various body parts.\n&gt; \n&gt; I alway=\r\ns suggest to people to do nyasa as taught by elders (so that the knowledge =\r\nlives and is passed on), but not worry too much about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I said, w=\r\ne are in the midst of deepening Kali and the level of sadhakas is not as hi=\r\ngh as in the old days. Technical perfection will become rarer and rarer. It=\r\n is better to focus on surrender and humility.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourse=\r\nlf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; S=\r\npirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writin=\r\ngs: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; ------------ -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- Veneet Kumar &lt;kvenee=\r\nt@yahoo. com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; In the Bhagvata Gita, Krishna says that I am &quot;Jap=\r\na&quot; amongst all Yajnas. This statement establishes the supremacy of Japa ove=\r\nr all other kinds of rituals. I have the following queries regarding Japa.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Many a times while doing japa the mind wanders. The chanting do=\r\nne at these instants are done without any &quot;bhavana&quot; or sense of devotion in=\r\n the mind and are merely a physical chanting. Are such japas unfruitful?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) Is there some way to validate that the japa shall actually bring =\r\ncertain merits or nullify the targeted evils? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) How can an ordin=\r\nary person determine whether the japa he is doing (or has done) is being do=\r\nne in a proper manner? For example if there was some error in pronunciation=\r\n or some nyasa was not performed correctly which invalidated the japa - can=\r\n it be detected by the sadhaka himself by some means? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) There is=\r\n a tradition of doing some nyasa etc before doing mantras where deities are=\r\n invited on various body parts. Do those deities actually come and protect =\r\nthe entire process of Japa? Can one perceive their presence in anyway - say=\r\n maybe by observing a change in the aura around the sadhaka?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; with =\r\nregards\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
