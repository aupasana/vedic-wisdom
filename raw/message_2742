My comments on\n&gt; that is:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. I-ness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has no innate power to\n&gt; Control any other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.\n&gt; &gt; Reason:\n&gt; &gt; Soul is the only Truth and controller, everything else has an unreal and\n&gt; derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate with each other, and\n&gt; not control each other.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2. A new-born child or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his\n&gt; sense-consciousness coherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness\n&gt; derived from Manas, that coordinates the senses.\n&gt; &gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty to interact with manas\n&gt; (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you have proposed. Thus,\n&gt; Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of I-ness, not due to\n&gt; Buddhi.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of individualized consciousness, which\n&gt; one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka\n&gt; or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of course not!\n&gt; If someone says &quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel\n&gt; offended or if someone says &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one may\n&gt; feel elated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or\n&gt; praise, even though nothing is being done to the physical body and only a\n&gt; name is being used. When somebody calls one by name from distance (as\n&gt; opposed to patting on the physical body and calling), one&#39;s consciousness\n&gt; may still think &quot;I am being called&quot; and one may turn towards the caller. As\n&gt; in these examples, one&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself to more than a\n&gt; body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping. One may have forgotten totally\n&gt; about the physical body in the dream! One may think of something else as\n&gt; &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a different body or may not even\n&gt; &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one may have the sense that so and so thing is\n&gt; happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away from the physical\n&gt; body, there is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That is\n&gt; ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is absolutely\n&gt; unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-ness)\n&gt; because they do not have physical bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni does\n&gt; have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he did not\n&gt; have that I-ness, he would not do everything he does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individualized consciousness do\n&gt; interact with each other, whether we use the word &quot;control&quot; for some of\n&gt; those interactions or not. For example, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating\n&gt; mind) judges various past experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor\n&gt; mind) and tells it what to do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas\n&gt; (organs of action) and makes them do various things. My buddhi determined\n&gt; what to write and my manas told my hands to type this and I ended up typing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totally\n&gt; out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the\n&gt; logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different\n&gt; parts of individualized consciousness and they play different roles while\n&gt; interacting with each other in different ways. Some of those interactions\n&gt; may be deemed to be controls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in details.

Where did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One does not &quot;read up&quot; these things in a single place. There are\n&gt; different abstractions and breakdowns of what happens in individualized\n&gt; consciousness. There are several sources that speak of different aspects of\n&gt; this knowledge in slightly different terms.

Your understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the\n&gt; ideational or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the\n&gt; physical body (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without\n&gt; a physical/astral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara like\n&gt; we do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a fine line between the sense of I-ness attributed to the\n&gt; Individual Soul and the sense of I-ness derived through the idea of\n&gt; Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuality\n&gt; of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), while it has\n&gt; already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Individuality of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of\n&gt; Ahamkara because &quot;What exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea\n&gt; of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account\n&gt; for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of\n&gt; another, without requiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your\n&gt; buddhi would always interfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or\n&gt; the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces\n&gt; and are not related as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is independent\n&gt; of the application of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and\n&gt; Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence\n&gt; is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is\n&gt; very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still\n&gt; carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upon that particular\n&gt; idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the\n&gt; Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astral\n&gt; and Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the\n&gt; human activities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire\n&gt; individualized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is\n&gt; not the same as for an astral/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An Astral-bodied being thinks of Manas/sense- consciousness as the\n&gt; very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/perceptive- consciousness as\n&gt; the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, that individuality is of the Soul not derived from any idea,\n&gt; which is why it is not lost when the Astral being loses astral consciousness\n&gt; and reincarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an example, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are able to work\n&gt; through all the beings in all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like\n&gt; Ganesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never\n&gt; getting controlled by Ahamkara that would require them to say that this\n&gt; particular body is &quot;my body&quot; or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in\n&gt; Physical bodies themselves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied\n&gt; beings, so they would attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of\n&gt; the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to\n&gt; possess ones&#39; physical body as well as act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a\n&gt; Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising\n&gt; Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5\n&gt; functions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising\n&gt; Physical body (16 chemical elements).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as we all know that Physical body expires as a whole, not just\n&gt; one or two of the 16 elements comprising it go away at a time, Astral and\n&gt; Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole in the corresponding cosmic\n&gt; consciousness - instead of different constituent ideas slipping out of it at\n&gt; different times. Chitta being the staging idea for all other modifications,\n&gt; can be termed as the last to go, when the causal body is finally dropped -\n&gt; hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manas with Subtle Astral vibrations and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta with infinitely Subtle Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi being another variable, can be developed or undeveloped\n&gt; irrespective of the other 34. Even illiterate Moodha, through surrender to\n&gt; their Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkara and so on...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store the\n&gt; residual impressions of all the past incarnations. However, being\n&gt; constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability to act upon\n&gt; (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container containing an inflammable\n&gt; liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana is required for That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Samskaras stored by Chitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti,\n&gt; Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta\n&gt; itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEther\n&gt; tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t\n&gt; get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all residual impressions, only\n&gt; Satva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on\n&gt; itself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its\n&gt; own nature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore katmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instrument of\n&gt; seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to\n&gt; see, hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the\n&gt; sense of egoism does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t\n&gt; create Astral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to\n&gt; sense everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is\n&gt; associated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousness , must\n&gt; be overcome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi\n&gt; (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who\n&gt; cannot be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are\n&gt; permitted to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye\n&gt; implies Sense-consciousness which is associated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in the same manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dristanushravika vishaya vitrishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That effect which comes to these who have given up their thirst after\n&gt; objects, either seen or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is\n&gt; non-attachment. Vivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to\n&gt; freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to\n&gt; Astral-Body and working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as an\n&gt; astral-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yogashchittavrittin irodhah -2-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, extinguishing all the movements of Chitta is called &quot;Yoga&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to\n&gt; Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or otherwise as a causal-bodied\n&gt; being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid you are mixing up terminologies. For example, ego or\n&gt; ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limited to the physical body, but extends\n&gt; to subtle body and causal body as well. In fact, ego resides in the causal\n&gt; body and affects other bodies. Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta\n&gt; (remembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of\n&gt; the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas\n&gt; (sensory-motor mind) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or\n&gt; thinking mind) analyzes current and past observations of mind or chitta\n&gt; (remembering or conditioned mind) stores various observations or retrieves\n&gt; previously stored observations, they are all guided by the sense of I-ness.\n&gt; That sense of I-ness permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized\n&gt; consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upanishads and various scriptures have broken down the\n&gt; individualized consciousness into various groups by functionality, like five\n&gt; koshas, three sareeras, five praanas, five jnaanendriyas, five karmendriyas,\n&gt; four antahkaranas, six/seven chakras etc. But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the\n&gt; very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though the word jnaana means different things to different people,\n&gt; a jnaana yogi pursues Self by the path of contemplation and discrimination.\n&gt; When a jnaana yogi reaches the final target, all bodies and koshas are\n&gt; merged in cosmos.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion, there are three distinct phases that lead the\n&gt; sould to rise above Ego, Mind and Chitta - corresponding to the three bodies\n&gt; physical (Sthoola), astral (Sookshma) and causal (Karana) resp.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Ego is Jnana - Merging Physical body in Physical\n&gt; cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Mind is Vairagya - Merging Astral body in Astral\n&gt; cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Chitta is Yoga - Merging Causal body in Causal\n&gt; cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, becoming established in Para-Brahman is YogaArudha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your comments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

One pursuing that path may or may not debate with\n&gt; others and may or may not read many scriptures, but one will analyze and\n&gt; debate within oneself. One starts with the basic axioms (e.g. Self is\n&gt; imperishable and without a beginning or an end). One will go on eliminating\n&gt; things that one is aware of as not being Self. For example, body has a\n&gt; beginning and end and is perishable. So it is not Self. One introspects like\n&gt; this and, though the process of elimination, finally finds the true Self.\n&gt; That is gyaana yoga.

Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinat=\r\ne with each other, and not control each other. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 2. A new=\r\n-born child or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sense-consci=\r\nousness coherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived fro=\r\nm Manas, that coordinates the senses.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; He has no Buddhi or discrimi=\r\nnating faculty to interact with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what=\r\n to do - as you have proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to i=\r\nts own sense of I-ness, not due to Buddhi.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I hope this =\r\nclarifies.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Nitish&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Out of t=\r\nhe 19 or 35 attributes of individualized consciousness, which one gives the=\r\n idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it is aham=\r\nkaraka or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of =\r\ncourse not! If someone says &quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quo=\r\nt;, one may feel offended or if someone says &quot;so and so person is a gr=\r\neat person&quot;, one may feel elated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is iden=\r\ntifying with the criticism or praise, even though nothing is being done to =\r\nthe physical body and only a name is being used. When somebody calls one by=\r\n name from distance (as opposed to patting on the physical body and calling=\r\n), one&#39;s consciousness may still think &quot;I am being called&quot; an=\r\nd one may turn towards the caller. As in these examples, one&#39;s I-ness d=\r\noes of course bind itself to more than a body.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping. One may have forgotten totally a=\r\nbout the physical body in the dream! One may think of something else as &qu=\r\not;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a different body or may not e=\r\nven &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one may have the sense that so and so=\r\n thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away=\r\n from the physical body, there is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (=\r\nI-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is =\r\nabsolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical bod=\r\ny.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agni do n=\r\not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have physical bodies is incor=\r\nrect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and th=\r\nis is what I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he would not do ever=\r\nything he does.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas =\r\nof individualized consciousness do interact with each other, whether we use=\r\n the word &quot;control&quot; for some of those interactions or not. For ex=\r\nample, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges various past exper=\r\niences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. =\r\nThen manas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do=\r\n various things. My buddhi determined what to write and my manas told my ha=\r\nnds to type this and I ended up typing.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Your =\r\npoint about &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totall=\r\ny out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the log=\r\nical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts=\r\n of individualized consciousness and they play different roles while intera=\r\ncting with each other in different ways. Some of those interactions may be =\r\ndeemed to be controls.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up =\r\nthe terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; go in detai=\r\nls. Your understanding is flawed.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2.=\r\n Where did you read this up ?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; One does not &qu=\r\not;read up&quot; these things in a single place. There are different abstra=\r\nctions and breakdowns of what happens in individualized consciousness. Ther=\r\ne are several sources that speak of different aspects of this knowledge in =\r\nslightly different terms.

Your understanding is flawed.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1.=\r\n All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the ideationa=\r\nl or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the physical body (=\r\nSee point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a physical/ast=\r\nral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara like we do.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and =\r\nbuddhi also. When manas (sensory-&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all g=\r\nuided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this up ?&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a fine line between the sense of =\r\nI-ness attributed to the Individual Soul and the sense of I-ness derived th=\r\nrough the idea of Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies,=\r\n the individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection implies =\r\nthat), while it has already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all oth=\r\ner ideas.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Individuality of a causal=\r\n-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What exists =\r\nas a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one =\r\nof the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account for neither control=\r\ns the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, without re=\r\nquiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always in=\r\nterfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life=\r\n-forces and so on.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the=\r\n 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces and are not related as=\r\n cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is independent of the application o=\r\nf the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of =\r\nthe Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence is not &quot;contr=\r\nolled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It =\r\nis very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still=\r\n carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upon that particu=\r\nlar idea.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nBut ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; individualized consciousness.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/cau=\r\nsal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astral and =\r\nCausal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the hum=\r\nan activities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire indiv=\r\nidualized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not =\r\nthe same as for an astral/causal bodied being.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An Astra=\r\nl-bodied being thinks of Manas/sense- consciousness as the very basis of th=\r\ne entire individualized consciousness.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied b=\r\neing thinks of Chitta/perceptive- consciousness as the very basis of the en=\r\ntire individualized consciousness.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, that individ=\r\nuality is of the Soul not derived from any idea, which is why it is not los=\r\nt when the Astral being loses astral consciousness and reincarnates in the =\r\nPhysical body.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As an example, Devata=\r\ns, with their finer bodies, are able to work through all the beings in all =\r\ntheir physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the Mooladhara=\r\n, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never getting controlled by Ahamkara=\r\n that would require them to say that this particular body is &quot;my body&=\r\nquot; or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies themse=\r\nlves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so they would att=\r\nempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipp=\r\ner. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; physical b=\r\nody as well as act out their Ahamkara.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remember=\r\ning or conditioned &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-n=\r\ness) are parts of the kaarana &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body=\r\n) and remain till the end.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per=\r\n the resurrected Soul of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that i=\r\nnclude 19 ideas comprising Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 =\r\nfunctions of knowledge, 5 functions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) a=\r\nnd 16 ideas comprising Physical body (16 chemical elements).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as we all know that Physical body expires as=\r\n a whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising it go away at a=\r\n time, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole in the corresp=\r\nonding cosmic consciousness - instead of different constituent ideas slippi=\r\nng out of it at different times. Chitta being the staging idea for all othe=\r\nr modifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the causal body is f=\r\ninally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical=\r\n vibrations, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Manas with Subtle Astral vibrations and &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta with infinitely Subtle Causal Vibrations.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi being another variable, can be develo=\r\nped or undeveloped irrespective of the other 34. Even illiterate Moodha, th=\r\nrough surrender to their Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkara and so on...&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is not the Conditioned Min=\r\nd. Chitta does store the residual impressions of all the past incarnations.=\r\n However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent=\r\n ability to act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container conta=\r\nining an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana=\r\n is required for That.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Samskaras stored by Chitta, =\r\nincluding those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond t=\r\no the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Sa=\r\ntvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail=\r\n). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo=\r\n-guni Samskaras it stores.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once the Chitta calms down, =\r\ncleared of all residual impressions, only Satva Guna remains, the intuition=\r\n becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on itself as distinct from Satva Gu=\r\nna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its own nature as Brahman.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Su=\r\ntras: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore katmataivasmita -6&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instrument of se=\r\neing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sin=\r\nce astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear, s=\r\nmell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of egois=\r\nm does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Astra=\r\nl Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everythin=\r\ng.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted =\r\nout while the consciousness is associated with the Physical Body sensory ac=\r\ntivities or has Physical Karma.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. T=\r\nhe idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousness , must be overco=\r\nme in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter =\r\n43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who cannot be te=\r\nmpted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted to =\r\nstay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-co=\r\nnsciousness which is associated with Manas.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in the same manner :=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dristanushravika vishaya vitrishnas=\r\nya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nat effect which comes to these who have given up their thirst after objects=\r\n, either seen or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non-atta=\r\nchment. Vivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to freedom.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by tran=\r\nsferring the consciousness to Astral-Body and working out the Astral Karma =\r\nor otherwise as an astral-bodied being.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yogashchittavrittin irodha=\r\nh -2-&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, extinguishing all the movements of Chitta is=\r\n called &quot;Yoga&quot;. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is t=\r\no be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to Causal-Body and work=\r\ning out the Causal Karma or otherwise as a causal-bodied being.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;=\r\npvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nit=\r\nish,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid you are m=\r\nixing up terminologies. For example, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is =\r\nnot limited to the physical body, but extends to subtle body and causal bod=\r\ny as well. In fact, ego resides in the causal body and affects other bodies=\r\n. Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) an=\r\nd ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana sareera (causal body) =\r\nand remain till the end.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nAhamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-motor min=\r\nd) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or thinking mind) analyz=\r\nes current and past observations of mind or chitta (remembering or conditio=\r\nned mind) stores various observations or retrieves previously stored observ=\r\nations, they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness pe=\r\nrmeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upanishads and various scriptu=\r\nres have broken down the individualized consciousness into various groups b=\r\ny functionality, like five koshas, three sareeras, five praanas, five jnaan=\r\nendriyas, five karmendriyas, four antahkaranas, six/seven chakras etc. But =\r\nego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire individualized consci=\r\nousness.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though the word =\r\njnaana means different things to different people, a jnaana yogi pursues Se=\r\nlf by the path of contemplation and discrimination. When a jnaana yogi reac=\r\nhes the final target, all bodies and koshas are merged in cosmos.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourse=\r\nlf: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/=\r\na&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://rologer.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rologer.org/&lt;/a&gt; homam=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.=\r\nVedicAst&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://rolog=\r\ner.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rologer.org/&lt;/a&gt; tarpana&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Spirituality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.&lt;=\r\n/a&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://yahoo.com/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;yahoo.com/&lt;/a&gt; group/ve=\r\ndic- wisdom&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;a href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://vedicastro.&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/a&gt; home.comcast. =\r\nnet&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;a href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://rologer.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\nri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagan&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://nath.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_=\r\nblank&quot;&gt;nath.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; ---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@ &gt; wrote: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion, there are three distinct phases that=\r\n lead the sould to rise above Ego, Mind and Chitta - corresponding to the t=\r\nhree bodies physical (Sthoola), astral (Sookshma) and causal (Karana) resp.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above E=\r\ngo is Jnana - Merging Physical body in Physical cosmos&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Rising above Mind is Vairagya - Merging Astral body in Astral cosm=\r\nos&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Chitta is Yoga - Merging Causa=\r\nl body in Causal cosmos&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; Finally, becoming established in Para-Brahman is YogaArudha.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your comments.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yah=\r\noogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

One pursuing that path may or may no=\r\nt debate with others and may or may not read many scriptures, but one will =\r\nanalyze and debate within oneself. One starts with the basic axioms (e.g. S=\r\nelf is imperishable and without a beginning or an end). One will go on elim=\r\ninating things that one is aware of as not being Self. For example, body ha=\r\ns a beginning and end and is perishable. So it is not Self. One introspects=\r\n like this and, though the process of elimination, finally finds the true S=\r\nelf. That is gyaana yoga. Pure gyaana yoga is very difficult to follow in t=\r\nhis age.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Vichaara (contemplation) is the process of sadhana for an adherer of pu=\r\nre gyaana yoga.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; However, the gyaana (knowledge of Self) achieved by such a person=\r\n at the end is not really different from the knowledge of Self achieved by =\r\na person following another path.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt;       Try =\r\nthe new Yahoo!
