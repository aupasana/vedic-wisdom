We used to go to the Skandasramam, to bathe a=\r\ns there was a\nwaterfall.\n\nShe was too old, you see, and so she could not ac=\r\ncompany us. We had at the\ntime two big kamandalams with us. We made one of =\r\nthem ourselves.\n\nThe other, some one brought and gave us. Each could hold a=\r\n small potful of\nwater. I used to bring water in both of them, carrying one=\r\n in each hand.\n\nShe used to sit down wearing a small cloth and I used to po=\r\nur the water over\nher head just as we do abhishekam over an idol. That is h=\r\now she used to have\nher bath. There was no cooking. Some one used to wash h=\r\ner cloth and bring it\nback.\n\nThat was all.

He cast his =\r\neyes on\nthat\nkamandalam. He knew it was no good asking Perumalswamy and oth=\r\ners and so he\napproached Mother.\n\nShe was a simpleton.
