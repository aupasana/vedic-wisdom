Some precautions at the physical level can augment spiritu=\r\nal practice. If possible, see a good ayurvedic practitioner. Though western=\r\n medicine will give some &quot;XYZ syndrome&quot; name to these physio-mental conditi=\r\nons and give medicines, it often addresses only the superficial symptoms an=\r\nd lets the rootcause fester and even get worse. Ayurveda can be helpful.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Also, read up on the internet about vata pacifying foods and eat g=\r\nrains, legumes (dals), vegetables, fruits, spices etc that do not aggravate=\r\n vata. For example, if you eat only salad for a few days, your fearful cond=\r\nition may get much worse. If you eat fully cooked & soft vegetables with mi=\r\nldly spiced gravy, it may get better. And so on. Follow basic ayurvedic gui=\r\ndelines for a while.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; One more thing that may help is to not flow=\r\n in that emotion when the emotion (e.g. fear or anxiety or anger) hits you.=\r\n Once you are aware of that emotion, think that it is goddess who manifests=\r\n in your mind as that emotion. The all powerful goddess manifests as happin=\r\ness, sadness, ability, weakness, fear, bravery, pride, humility etc. Think =\r\nof Her and think of how She manifests as various emotions and sensations in=\r\n our consciousness based on our conditioning and fructification of our karm=\r\nas. This may not solve the problem, but it expands your mind&#39;s focus/pre-oc=\r\ncupation from one specific emotion to a broader topic and can anchor it bac=\r\nk to god.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & =\r\nSpirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt;From: cuteyashica &lt;cuteyas=\r\nhica@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, July 30, 2=\r\n013 6:54 AM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] ( Anger Emotion- Ego  ) During Havan=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;Hare Rama Krishna\n&gt; &gt;Om Gurave Namah \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Re=\r\nspected SIR \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Please guide me what is happening with me and why ..Fir=\r\nst I am very vulnerable to sounds ...Loud Rock music shakes me completely a=\r\nnd I am so fearful at home ..I was doing havan diligently for 2 -3 weeks an=\r\nd I wanted to overcome fear and prayed for that ..I was able to overcome fe=\r\nars at home and then there is a break and I couldnt do havan for 10-12 days=\r\n ..I was very happy and had mental peace for the time I was doing Havan and=\r\n really feeling bliss ...and complete mental tension after the 10-12 days w=\r\nhen I didnt do havan ...I did havan day before yesterday and I couldnt tole=\r\nrate the noise coming and this brought anger in me and I chanted mantras in=\r\n anger and had given aahutis ...I dont know what will the consequences of t=\r\nhis ...What should I do if such anger emotion ,which is a part of ego arise=\r\ns while performing havan ..This has happened second time and usually I dont=\r\n get angry but while performing havan ..my Mind was really blown away ...I =\r\nam very\n&gt;  sensitive to sounds ...Should a person do homam when his mind is=\r\n too disturbed day and night ...In those thoughts , its so hard to do homam=\r\n ...Hearing a noise , I always have that fear at back of mind , what if I g=\r\not blank hearing noises , will I be able to complete havan ...I am at very =\r\nlow level of consciousness , But I need guidance ....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Secondly , Sin=\r\nce I was not able to do homam , because of my thought process , I started r=\r\neciting Devi Kavach , cos I want to talk to God ...and say mother goddess S=\r\nave me please ...But my mind is at disturbed and fearful state ...What shou=\r\nld I do ...I need guidance ....\n&gt; &gt;I will be grateful to You ...Please Guid=\r\ne Sir ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks Once Again \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
