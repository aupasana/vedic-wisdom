Is it that the \n&gt; animals are doing more and more good to be reborn as humans\n\nAn animal can be reborn as a human being (1) if it does some good karma to \nbe reborn as a human being, or, (2) if some human beings have done it such \nbad things that it can pay it back only if it is reborn as a human beings. \nAs human beings eat more meat and treat animals more cruelly and start \nmessing with nature more, many animals may be reborn as human beings for \nreason (2). Such a thing will increase the number of human beings with more \nanimalistic instincts.\n\n&gt; * Are the number of souls in the world finite or infinite?\n\nWhen universe is in Kaalaraatri state, all souls return to Brahman and have \nno separate/individual existence, i.e. there is only Brahman. In other \nwords, the number of individual souls is zero. Later, during the world \ncycle, the number of goes on increasing, as more and more parts of Brahman \nare separated with individualized self-awareness.\n\nMany souls we see around us are separated from Brahman in Kali yuga. But \nsome souls around us were separated from Brahman in Dwapara yuga or Treta \nyuga and are more evolved.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;vamsikrishna_mumbai&quot; &lt;vamsikrishna_mumbai_09@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, May 16, 2009 2:37 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Dharma or Choice?\n\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; Whether past lives exist is a debate - Krishna tells this in the Bhagavad \n&gt; Gita\n&gt; even in the west Edgar Cayce and others claim to have taken people to \n&gt; their past lives using hypnosis - The book &quot;many mansions&quot; for example or \n&gt; Brian Weiss in &quot;many lives, many masters&quot; The conclusions of both are \n&gt; similar - that we seem to reap the benefits/harm of our doings in past \n&gt; lives.\n&gt;\n&gt; From another angle, it is might just be a rational way for humans to\n&gt; attribute a &quot;reason&quot; for doings in this lives. This is the rational\n&gt; explaination - we need to attribute a reason for our current being and a \n&gt; logical explaination is many lives.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some thoughts that occur randomly in my mind on this:\n&gt; * How come the number of human beings keeps on increasing? Is it that the \n&gt; animals are doing more and more good to be reborn as humans\n&gt; * How come all politicians and power holders are so bad - e.g: Has Deve \n&gt; Gowda done something extremely great to have such a good life - he is PM, \n&gt; his uneducated son is CM\n&gt; * Are the number of souls in the world finite or infinite?\n&gt;\n&gt; Coming to rajesh&#39;s problem - I think he is solely responsible for the mess \n&gt; he has landed in - it was his choice and he must stand by it - this is the \n&gt; logical thing that seems right in the Indian context.\n&gt; If it were US or western world - he could have walked out\n&gt;\n&gt; So either decision is correct/wrong in context\n&gt;\n&gt; but to attribute it to telling that if he says &#39;no&#39; he might have to have \n&gt; a bad next life and so on - karmic debt etc may not be the right reason - \n&gt; as past lives are themselves debatable\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Vamsi\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dharma means the right thing to do. However, one&#39;s dharma towards various\n&gt;&gt; people and objects can pull one in different directions. One has to \n&gt;&gt; balance\n&gt;&gt; one&#39;s dharma towards various people and objects and make the right \n&gt;&gt; decision.\n&gt;&gt; Any action taken now with a self-identification with the action (i.e. \n&gt;&gt; mind\n&gt;&gt; thinking &quot;I am doing it&quot;) becomes a karma for future and will give its\n&gt;&gt; fruits (good or bad) in future.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Though we are not the body, we temporarily live in a body for a few \n&gt;&gt; decades.\n&gt;&gt; This body is like a house we live in and its sense organs (eyes, ears \n&gt;&gt; etc)\n&gt;&gt; are like windows in the house. When we live in a house, we have the\n&gt;&gt; responsibility to take care of it and keep the house and its surroundings\n&gt;&gt; nice. Similarly, we have some duty to make the body happy. Give it food,\n&gt;&gt; water etc, nourish it well, take good care of it, make sure it is \n&gt;&gt; healthy,\n&gt;&gt; make sure its pleasures are taken care of and make sure it is gratified.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However, we also have duties to other people, like parents, elders,\n&gt;&gt; relatives, friends etc. In addition, there may be persons with strong \n&gt;&gt; debts\n&gt;&gt; with us who come into our life later. We have duties towards them. \n&gt;&gt; Moreover,\n&gt;&gt; we have some duties towards the society we live in, the country we live \n&gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; and the entire universe.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; These various duties can pull one in different directions. One has to\n&gt;&gt; balance them all and do the best possible action. Arjuna&#39;s duty towards \n&gt;&gt; his\n&gt;&gt; guru Drona was to respect him and obey him. But his duty to his brother \n&gt;&gt; (and\n&gt;&gt; also to the universe) required him to kill his guru who was on \n&gt;&gt; Duryodhana&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; side.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Usually, one&#39;s duty towards one&#39;s own body and its gratification is a \n&gt;&gt; very\n&gt;&gt; small part of one&#39;s dharma and one&#39;s duty towards others should receive a\n&gt;&gt; higher priority. The larger the number of people impacted, the higher the\n&gt;&gt; weightage.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If one&#39;s only motivation for doing something that would hurt many people \n&gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; self-gratification, one is on a shaky basis. With such self-centered\n&gt;&gt; actions, one is likely to create far more new karmas than the old karmas \n&gt;&gt; one\n&gt;&gt; is getting rid of. Of course, if not hurting others now leads to \n&gt;&gt; something\n&gt;&gt; else later that will hurt all those people even more, then that is worse. \n&gt;&gt; A\n&gt;&gt; lot depends on one&#39;s self-control. Choosing the lesser evil is a \n&gt;&gt; difficult\n&gt;&gt; exercise when one of the evils is not visible yet...\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Nobody can make the right decision for you. You are responsible for your\n&gt;&gt; actions and will face the reactions to those actions later. For example, \n&gt;&gt; if\n&gt;&gt; you have a debt to this girl and escape it now by calling off the \n&gt;&gt; marriage\n&gt;&gt; for looks, you will have to pay it back later with interest. For example,\n&gt;&gt; you may be born with terrible looks and many may reject you. Or the girl \n&gt;&gt; may\n&gt;&gt; be born with more undesirable qualities and yet you may have to marry \n&gt;&gt; her.\n&gt;&gt; So many possibilities are there and one cannot know for sure what is in\n&gt;&gt; store.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Whatever you decide, good luck to that girl, to your elders and also to \n&gt;&gt; you!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; BTW, this forum is for spiritual discussions and matters related to\n&gt;&gt; spiritual sadhana. Your request is only marginally related. This kind of\n&gt;&gt; discussions can derail the forum from its primary purpose. So I request\n&gt;&gt; members to show some discretion.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;rajeshhebbar2009&quot; &lt;rajeshhebbar2009@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, May 13, 2009 2:09 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma or Choice?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Is Dharma the right thing to follow or personal choice?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; My marriage is fixed with a girl who I said &#39;yes&#39; but currently feel is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not good looking enough.
