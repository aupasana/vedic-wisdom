But when Mumbai-based Muslim industrialist, &lt;br&gt;&gt; As=\r\nhik Ali Nathani saw its terrible condition, he was inspired to revamp &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; the temple as a means to promote communal harmony.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;It=\r\n was Ganpati Bappa and our 33 crore deities who inspired me. Through &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; their help and the blessings of Allah, I&#39;ve been able to accomplish this=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; mission. I don&#39;t see any difference between a temple and mosque, =\r\nthey &lt;br&gt;&gt; are all places of worship,&quot; said Ashik Ali Nathani.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; Even though, some purists attacked the move as promoting idol worsh=\r\nip &lt;br&gt;&gt; which is prohibited under Islam, Nathani refused to budge and e=\r\nmployed &lt;br&gt;&gt; some of the finest artisans and spent over Rs. two crore t=\r\no restore the &lt;br&gt;&gt; temple.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; And his deed has brought hi=\r\nm accolades from all those who have come to &lt;br&gt;&gt; know of his work.&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &quot;From a humanist viewpoint and to promote goodwill among Hind=\r\nus and &lt;br&gt;&gt; Muslims, he has set a really special example for us,&quot; said =\r\none person, &lt;br&gt;&gt; while the other said, &quot;From his work, we need to learn=\r\n that Hindus and &lt;br&gt;&gt; Muslims are one and we should never fight among o=\r\nurselves.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Now enthused by this positive response Nathani =\r\nhas also promised to open &lt;br&gt;&gt; a school and a hospital to serve people =\r\nin this area.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The whole event is a reflection of the deep =\r\nroots of India&#39;s composite &lt;br&gt;&gt; culture. And no matter what efforts are=\r\n made to polarise communities, &lt;br&gt;&gt; this temple will now inspire genera=\r\ntions to build bonds of brotherhood &lt;br&gt;&gt; beyond religious boundaries.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n =\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n&lt;meta http-equiv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-528307112-1296448618=:1747--\r\n\n"}}
