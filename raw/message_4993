But what can be said after \nsome logical thinking is that if needs to &quot;t=\r\nest&quot; her bhakts on some matter, then \nobviously she does not know her bhakt=\r\n becuase otherwise there would be no need \nfor a test. And if she does not =\r\nknow her bhakt, how can she be the shakti to \nrule over all?\n\nThe tests whi=\r\nch people refer to are usually the hardships that one has to face \nwhile un=\r\ndertaking a sadhana. When one performs a sadhana, it is only to achieve \nso=\r\nme goal whether that be spiritual or material objective and the need for \ns=\r\nadhana is becuase the native feels that otherwise he/she may not be able \nt=\r\no=C2=A0achive the goal easily. So essentially the purpose of a sadhana is t=\r\no remove \nthe karmic burden towards achieving the goal. Law of karma does n=\r\not let anyone \nof the hook though. The harships that you face while perform=\r\ning a sadhana might \nappear like a &quot;test&quot; to a sadhaka but is essentially t=\r\nhe Lord bringing necessary \nhardships your way which creates the suffering =\r\nin the sadhaka that lets the \nsadhaka shed some of the karma. The sadhaka w=\r\nill eventually be successful but \nthe effort required and the hardships tha=\r\nt are yet to be faced depends on the \nkarmic burden.\n\nIf the karmic burden =\r\nis less, suffering is less and success is obtained without \nmuch suffering =\r\n(relatively speaking). If the karmic burden is very heavy, you \nmay suffer =\r\nwithout seeing any success. Though you are now closer to your goal \nafter t=\r\nhe suffering, but since the goal is not achieved, you do not see the \nresul=\r\nts of your effort and feel the effort was a waste.\n\nMA does not tests...the=\r\n hardships are brought to your way by her to purge you \nkarmically to let y=\r\nou achieve what you want.\n\nThis is my belief, and this I use as a basis whe=\r\nn performing a sadhana. I am \nsure others may have other views though.\n\nReg=\r\nards,\nBhupendra.\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: parijat_d &lt;pari=\r\njat_d@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wed, September 29, =\r\n2010 4:20:17 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] A query\n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaste,\ni am pari=\r\njat dutta from kolkata.there are some issues going on i need to \ndiscuss..\n=\r\n\nsince i was 18-19,i became interested in tantras.and i worship ma kali.bt =\r\ni feel \ni had and may be have to face several tests....like initially...i r=\r\nead books on \ntantra....wich promise highly materialistically beneficial sa=\r\ndhanas..\nand alarmingly different dieties for each purpose...i fell for tha=\r\nt...an my \ndevotion was divided...between maa kali,durga,laxmi,hanumanji..\n=\r\n\nwith time i realized all these have no value without a gurus guidance.....=\r\nmy \nastrologer told me....that time will be arnd 29-30 of my age.\n\nthen aga=\r\nin...i was against krishna worship.....cuzz i thot fooshingly since he \nis =\r\nonly about love(bhakti)....he may not be strong like devis..\nagain since...=\r\nall the tridevs need shakti...so i felt shakti worship is the \nhighest....\n=\r\nun\nalso...at that time..i didnot like ramkrishna dev since he talked mostly=\r\n of \ndevotion...n not of powers like siddhis....\nundestanding others though=\r\nts n so on...as i have personally seen some tantrics \nwho have this power..=\r\n\n\nwith time again i learnt bhakti is the highest.......i asked once a mahar=\r\naj who \npresides over the ashram where my mother was initiated ...\nwhich is=\r\n more powerful ?? bhakti or mantras ??....\n\nhe said...in one word...bhakti =\r\nis more powerful...without bhakti u wont have the \nurge to have a mantra...=\r\n\n\nagain in a book....i read...the love of gopis for krishna was such.....th=\r\ney \nforgot everything of mundane world..\nthey didnot want to know who krish=\r\nna was.....dint care if he was god or \nnot......jst loving for the sake of =\r\nloving..\nbhakti only for the sake of bhakti....\n\nhow wonderful !!!....all t=\r\nhese made me realize.....how foolish i was.....all i \nused to have for maa =\r\nwas bhakti...i dint \n\nknow any mantra nothin (not now as well) and i was ag=\r\nainst on the other hand \n.....of krishna and ramkrishnadev who were epitome=\r\n of bhakti...\n\nat this time....i used to go to my mom&#39;s gurumaatas ashram..=\r\n.once in a spiritual \ndiscussion they said..\nget hold of only one ......he/=\r\nshe is antaryami...she understands wat ur inner \nneeds her...like a parent\n=\r\ndefinitely she will fulfill them......\n\nat the same time....narasimha ji to=\r\nld in one of the mails........&quot;mother knows \nthe best&quot;...\n\nthese have remov=\r\ned the misconceptions i had ...\n\nwhat i want to know is when one is devoted=\r\n to maa why does she test ??.....is it \na way to bring one closer to her th=\r\nrough realizations ??...\n\nwhen shes the all pervading shakti....why thers a=\r\n need for test \n??....also...while testing does she give her child enuff \n\n=\r\nstrength to pass the test ??\n\ni am looking forward to guidance from u peopl=\r\ne...\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1582840440-1285851083=:70882\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;=\r\nfont-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Parijat,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Let me t=\r\nell you that I&nbsp;really &quot;know&quot; the answer to your question and I guess n=\r\nobody knows the answer to what you are asking for.

since...al=\r\nl the tridevs need shakti...so i felt shakti worship is the highest....&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nun&lt;BR&gt;also...at that time..i didnot like ramkrishna dev since he talked mos=\r\ntly of
