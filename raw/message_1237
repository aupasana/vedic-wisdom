One Arabic professor \nmaking such c=\r\nlaim does not add much credibility to the argument unless \nhe has some comp=\r\nelling reasons to make such statement.\n\nWith in India, we find so called sc=\r\nholars arguing that Sanskrit came \nfrom other languages. You go south and w=\r\nill find quite a few Tamilians \nclaim Sanskrit is not moth of Tamil.\n\nI wou=\r\nld definitely be interested to see why the Arabic professor felt \nwhat he f=\r\nelt; how ever, the more important and basic question Utpal \nhad is: Why is =\r\nthe knowledge written down in such disputable manner. \nWhy it is not writte=\r\nn in simple words.\n\nUtpal, your observation is true. For a long time the kn=\r\nowledge is \npassed on orally and there are quite a few corruptions in the \n=\r\nscriptures as we have today.\n\nSome of the scriptures have redundancy built =\r\nin to ensure the \ncorruptions are checked to a large extension.\n\nComing to =\r\nthe different meanings, it could be on purpose to some \nextent to ensure on=\r\nly the individuals with correct attitude has the \nintution to understand it=\r\n. This could have been brought in by the \npeople who passed on the knowledg=\r\ne as they were seeing India getting \ninvaded. They carriers of knowledge ma=\r\ny have purposefully created the \nambiguities.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; De=\r\nar Utpalji\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Held as the finest language and mother of all the \n&gt; =\r\nother language - One Arabic language teacher recently made a bold \n&gt; commen=\r\nt that basis of Arabic language is sanskrit\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Can you provide some=\r\n references for this?

I&#39;ve see=\r\nn Scholars (Who are \n&gt; having knowledge of Jyotisha as well as Sankrita) de=\r\nbating endlessly \n&gt; on a particular verse . one or two lines or sometimes e=\r\nven a couple \n&gt; of words in a verse seems to create great confusions. we ha=\r\nve seen \n&gt; that different scholars tend to interpret and derive different \n=\r\n&gt; meaning from a same verse. i took the example of jyotish classics \n&gt; beca=\r\nuse we are more familiar with controversies in that area.\n&gt; \n&gt; This confusi=\r\non is also applicable in other literature of Sanskrit \n&gt; language.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why=\r\n Sanskrit (Held as the finest language and mother of all the \n&gt; other langu=\r\nage - One Arabic language teacher recently made a bold \n&gt; comment that basi=\r\ns of Arabic language is sanskrit) should create so \n&gt; much confusions among=\r\n the scholars. is it that ambiguous or the \n&gt; writers didn&#39;t wrote in a clu=\r\ntter-less fashion or the current \n&gt; generation is not sharp enough to grasp=\r\n the right meaning. Whatever \n&gt; may be the case, why a verse should fail to=\r\n give one a simple \n&gt; undisputable meaning at least literally like in our m=\r\nodern \nlanguages?\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Add more friends to your messenger and enjo=\r\ny!
