With practice, it will become smooth and you can \nstart to focus better of mantra.\n\nWhen priests perform homam on a grand scale, they distribute the tasks among \nthem. If you do on a smaller scale by yourself, you can do everything by \nyourself. In fact, the latter is better.\n\nIn fact, even when many priests do it together with one fire, it is good to \nhave one person managing the fire and offerings. If one chants, one prepares \nand chooses offerings and one finally makes the offerings in the fire, that \nis better than everybody making different offerings in fire. Ideally, the \ncontact with fire should be from one person. Of course, if each has a \nseparate homa kundam, all can make offerings in fire.\n\nNever think in terms of keeping the positive vibrations to yourself or \nwithin your house. Fire is the basis of creation. Fire rituals are important \nto maintain dharma in this universe and promote creation and sustenance. Do \nhomam thinking that you are doing your dharma and have no other thoughts of \nmotives. Of course, if you do your dharma by helping nature, nature WILL \nreward you for it. But leave it to nature and do your part selflessly. \nSelf-centeredness is an acid of which a single drop is sufficient to break \nthe milk of your ritual.\n\nActually, a homam done under the sky (i.e. in open air) is better than one \ndone under a roof (i.e. inside a house). However, when one cannot do in open \nair, one can do inside a house also.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;sgchar&quot; &lt;sgchar@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, January 26, 2009 12:10 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Ganapati Homa-2nd round\n\n\n&gt; HariOm Narasimha Ji\n&gt;\n&gt; I performed Ganapathi homa for a 2nd time 2 days back, this time\n&gt; with less mistakes, feel more comfortable, was able to handle the\n&gt; fire without any problems, i had bought fire wood from the local\n&gt; store. This time I also used very little Ghee, less than 100 gms for\n&gt; 1hr of homa. I found that the audio (Mp3) does not cover a few\n&gt; sections like Bali.Naivedya.\n&gt; Talking to a local expert he advised that normally they would assign\n&gt; one individual to add ghee, one to add samith, one to add modaks etc.\n&gt; In the write up the impression is that it is all done by the same\n&gt; person, is this correct?\n&gt; Does it matter if the homa is preformed outside the house in open\n&gt; air, is it done inside to keep the positive vibrations internal to\n&gt; the hosue? Please advise\n&gt;\n&gt; rgds\n&gt;\n&gt; shubha\n\n\n"}}
