Also the toes of the body are tied=\r\n together . Modern mystic Jaggi Vasudev says this is to prevent an easy rep=\r\nossession of the body by any stray spirits hence the body is kept on the S-=\r\nN axis.\n\nI beleive Vimalananda also writes about this in one of the three b=\r\nooks.\n\nLord Dakshinamurthy is the only one among the deities facing south a=\r\nnd the temples of Lord Dakshinamurthy also face south.\n\nI beleive rest from=\r\n the activities of the physical world is equal in meaning to death. Each da=\r\ny we are reborn said the Buddha.....During sleep the consciousness retreats=\r\n to the centre of the heart and if restful sleep occurs it is one step clos=\r\ner to samadhi . If one has very deep restful sleep with no dreams during th=\r\nat sleep he or she has no sense of name, fame , family ,caste or age. When =\r\npeople wake up at the very second of waking up they have a hard time rememb=\r\nering who they are...Which is among the states (Sushupti ) is closer to sam=\r\nadhi.\n\n\nSo the southern direction might naturally support the rest from the=\r\n activities of the world and might not be a bad direction to keep one&#39;s hea=\r\nd. Also one can keep it towards the eastern direction as well.\n\nRegards\nVem=\r\nparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Hemanth Srinivas=\r\n &lt;hemanthks@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Kishoreji:\n&gt; \n&gt; I know that after death=\r\n the head is kept facing south direction.

We also have very tiny cell potentials across all the cells in\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; the human body.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The blood flows from the heart to various organ=\r\ns and the direction is\n&gt; &gt; usually top to bottom. From Faraday&#39;s law of ele=\r\nctromagnetism which we\n&gt; &gt; studied in high school.If you place your thumb i=\r\nn the direction of the flow\n&gt; &gt; of current the fingers when wrapped will po=\r\nint the direction of the magnetic\n&gt; &gt; field. The pranic current is in the s=\r\name direction as blood flow.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is why the Shirshasana which reve=\r\nrses the blood flow is highly praised\n&gt; &gt; in yoga. Anywaz with the directio=\r\nn of flow of blood we get a North pole\n&gt; &gt; orientation for the head and sou=\r\nth pole orientation for the feet.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Like poles repel and hence if you=\r\n place your head in the Northern direction\n&gt; &gt; you might experience more dr=\r\neams due to the opposing poles and hence\n&gt; &gt; disturbed sleep.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The a=\r\nncients beleived in spiritualizaiton of sleep since a average human\n&gt; &gt; bei=\r\nng spends a lot of time in sleep. Hence could have advised the southern\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n direction to avoid this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Many scientists now are agreeing that Qua=\r\nntum theory applies to Biology as\n&gt; &gt; well.
