The \nold views on Indian history are so well-established in the west, despite not \nbeing proven, that works containing any other ideas encounter heavy \nresistance. He has not ruled out any options yet and doing everything in his \nhands.\n\nThose interested in the DVD can go to \nhttp://www.SaraswatiFilms.org/Krishna.html.\n\n*        *        *\n\nAll the shooting was done by Manish himself for this movie. He received a \nlittle assistance from me and a couple of other people, but did all the work \nhimself. For post-production work such as editing, music, graphics, voice \nover etc, he hired professionals in UK.\n\nIn 2007, he got inspiration during Chandi homam a few times that he should \nmake movies on spiritual matters. First goal was to contribute towards \nundoing the false history of India. Second goal was to establish correct, \ntolerant and integrated ideas of religion and spirituality and eliminate \ndivisive ideas. Third goal was to establish Veda dharma in the world. This \nmovie is a *humble beginning* towards achieving those goals.\n\nWhen Manish got that inspiration, he first ignored it. When the same \ninspiration kept coming in Chandi homam, he decided to act on it. Though he \nwasn&#39;t into photography, he spent a lot of money, bought a professional \ncamera, learnt how to use it, created a screenplay and started shooting. In \nthe beginning, he did not know what to do and how to do. One thing after \nanother got just worked out and things just happened. As he has been in \ntouch with me throughout this time, I am aware of how things happened and \nhow it worked out. Apart from the content, the movie is quite good in \ntechnical aspects and visually good too. It is surprising that Manish has \ngotten such a good grip over photography in less than 2 years.\n\nManish used to say &quot;this is our offering to Krishna and it should be as \nperfect as possible&quot;. He put in his best effort.\n\nHopefully, it will soon be on some channel. But it is all in His hands. As \nManish keeps reminding me, only effort is in our hands. So we must put in \nthe best effort possible. After that, we should not worry.\n\nBTW, I know that the second movie &quot;The Indian Jesus&quot; is dedicated to showing \nhow different religions show different paths to the same realization and how \nfights over religion are useless. This movie is based on the life of a great \nsaint who taught tolerance. It advances several ideas regarding god, \nspirituality and religion, using the life and miracles of that saint as the \nbackdrop. I think this movie is in post-production stages now.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &lt;kshroum@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, October 06, 2009 4:18 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Krishna (History or Myth)\n\n\n&gt; The &quot;Krishna (History or Myth) DVD&quot; from shri Manish ji&#39;s production \n&gt; arrived yesterday and I watched the first half of the wonderful \n&gt; documentary this morning.
