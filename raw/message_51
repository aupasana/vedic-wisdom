It is truly unfortunate, =\r\nhowever, \nthat despite the almost universally held importance of bhakti in =\r\nthe \nhistory of Yoga, there seems to have always been a good deal of \nmisun=\r\nderstanding on the part of many about what the terms &quot;bhakti&quot; \nand &quot;Bhakti =\r\nYoga&quot; actually mean.  I&#39;ve read even many supposedly \nknowledgeable authors=\r\n write that bhakti is the Yoga of &quot;emotion&quot;, or \nthat it somehow precludes =\r\nany involvement with jnana (knowledge, or \nintellectualism), philosophy, or=\r\n serious Yogic sadhana (practice).  \nNothing could be further from the trut=\r\nh.\n\nThe word &quot;bhakti&quot; is derived from the Sanskrit verb root `bhaj&#39;, \nmeani=\r\nng &quot;to share in, resort to, experience, partake of, cultivate, \nworship, go=\r\n to&quot;, etc. The object of this &quot;experiencing&quot; or &quot;partaking \nin&quot; is, of cour=\r\nse, God.  In this definition, we can begin to \nrecognize in seed form what =\r\nthe foundational basis of Bhakti Yoga \nconsists of.  \n\nBhakti is a trans-em=\r\notional state of consciousness that we are meant \nto cultivate and uncover =\r\nas the natural essence of our soul, and \nBhakti Yoga is a complex and rigor=\r\nous system of Yoga designed to \nbring its adherent to a progressively deepe=\r\nr state of meditative \nabsorption (samadhi) in the Divine.  Thus, the term =\r\n&quot;bhakti&quot; denotes \nboth a state of trans-empirical perceptual awareness and =\r\n\nphenomenological experience, as well as a philosophical system and \npraxis=\r\n designed to bring about such a higher state of awareness of \nthe Divine.  =\r\n\n\nBhakti is meditation in its fullest and deepest manifestation.   \nBhakti =\r\nactually denotes devotional meditative absorption. Unlike any \nother system=\r\n of Yoga, bhakti stands apart from all other systems in \nthat it actually c=\r\nonstitutes both a means (upaya) toward the goal of \nGod-realization (and th=\r\nus it is a Yoga), as well as the end (artha) \nof Yoga itself in the form of=\r\n a spiritual state of pure egolessness \nand God-consciousness.  Bhakti is n=\r\not only the most effective and \nmost highly recommended means of enlightenm=\r\nent, but bhakti IS \nenlightenment.\n\n&quot;Devotion&quot; in this correctly understood=\r\n bhakti sense is radically \ndifferent from &quot;emotion&quot;. Bhakti is a state of =\r\nconsciousness that is \ntranscendent in essence and which reflects the inner=\r\nmost, latent \nnature of the atman (true self) as being functionally conting=\r\nent and \nontologically sustained by the Absolute. Bhakti, or devotion in th=\r\nis \nmore phenomenological sense, represents the true functional nature of \n=\r\nour soul. There is nothing material, or emotional, or sentimental \nabout bh=\r\nakti at all.\n\nEmotion, on the other hand, is held universally by all the sc=\r\nhools of \nYoga and Dharmic spirituality, to be a purely material-originated=\r\n \nphenomenon that arises from manas (mind), chitta (psyche), desire \n(kama)=\r\n and anger (krodha). Thus, materially-inspired emotions are \nunreal, tempor=\r\nary and negative in the truest, spiritual sense. \nEmotions that stem from m=\r\naterialistic likes and dislikes are akin to \nphantasms that =96 while certa=\r\ninly experienced in a very real way when \nwe have them =96 are nonetheless =\r\nnot of lasting importance.  This is \nespecially true of negative emotions t=\r\nhat arise from our illusion of \nbeing separate from God. \n\nMaterial emotion=\r\ns, for the yogi, are to be transcended. Devotion, for \nthe yogi, is to be c=\r\nultivated.\n\nThis being said, Sanatana Dharma does not teach that emotions a=\r\nre \ninherently an evil or unwanted instrument.  Emotions in and of \nthemsel=\r\nves are actually a neutral tool.  They are a tool that can be \nused for eit=\r\nher good or for self-bondage.  The emotive mechanism is \njust as much a neu=\r\ntral tool as is our mind, body, intellect, etc.  \nJust as is true of our mi=\r\nnd, body, and intellect, it isn&#39;t that any \nof these tools are inherently e=\r\nither good or bad. Rather, they&#39;re \ngood if they are under our control, and=\r\n bad if they&#39;re not under our \ncontrol.\n\nWhen a person has an uncontrolled =\r\nmind, they&#39;re considered to be \nmentally disturbed. When a person has an un=\r\ncontrollable body, then \nthey&#39;re experiencing some sort of physical illness=\r\n. In the same way, \nwhen a person has emotions that are uncontrolled, they =\r\ntend to be \nemotionally unstable and thus unpeaceful. And peace is the dire=\r\nct \nmanifest symptom of spiritual transcendence.\n\nTo have normal, reactive =\r\nemotions toward things that happen in our \nlives is natural. Emotions arise=\r\n as a result of external things that \naffect us, which we then perceive as =\r\neither good or bad. Just like if \nsomeone hits us, we feel physical pain, i=\r\nn the same way if someone \nhurts us emotionally, we then feel emotional pai=\r\nn. Emotions are a \nnatural effect to external stimuli =96 or at least to ou=\r\nr perceptions \nof such stimuli.\n\nBut if we were to cry for the next week be=\r\ncause we gently stubbed our \ntoe, then we would be overreacting to a very m=\r\niniscule amount of \nphysical pain, and we wouldn&#39;t really be in control of =\r\nour physical \nreactions.  In the same way, if we overreact and give in to a=\r\n sea of \nuncontrollable emotion with every incident that happens to us, big=\r\n \nand small, then we are not serving ourselves, but rather being slaves \nof=\r\n our uncontrolled emotions.\n\nSo the idea that is espoused in Yoga spiritual=\r\nity is not to \nartificially repress, ignore, or stifle our emotions, mind, =\r\n\nintellect, ego, body, etc., but to see them in their proper place in \nrela=\r\ntion to spirit, our true self, and to then control and thus \ntranscend thei=\r\nr power over us.  It is a simple matter of having \ncontrol over our emotion=\r\ns, rather than allowing our emotions to have \ncontrol over us.  \n\nA prevale=\r\nnt misconception that many have is that God-realized, or \nenlightened, peop=\r\nle are necessarily emotionless people because they \nhave learned to transce=\r\nnd emotion.  Nothing could be further from the \ntruth.  God-realized people=\r\n are certainly not emotionless. On the \ncontrary! They can be the most fun =\r\npeople to be with. God-realized \nsages can laugh, can cry, and can even exh=\r\nibit anger when \nappropriate.  God-realized people can be emotional; but su=\r\nch emotions \ntend to be positive emotions that are used in God&#39;s service, a=\r\ns well \nas spiritual bhava, or transcendent states of consciousness that th=\r\ne \nunwise might mistakenly confuse with material emotions. God-realized \npe=\r\nrsons: 1) try not to be ruled by their emotions; 2) tend to focus \non more =\r\npositive emotions (love, compassion, pity, joy, etc.); 3) and \nultimately t=\r\nhe emotive states that they experience most deeply are \nthe transcendental =\r\nmellows of love between themselves and God, and \nnot the lower, reactive em=\r\notions that arise from sense perception.\n\nIn the highest state of Self-real=\r\nization and God-realization, our \nmaterial emotions are keenly surpassed an=\r\nd are subsequently replaced \nby devotional ecstasy and states of rapturous =\r\nspiritual elations the \nlikes of which nothing in our present perceptual st=\r\nate can \ncomprehend.  To experience such bliss, we must practice Bhakti Yog=\r\na, \nthe Yoga of devotion.  The greatest textbook on Bhakti Yoga is the \nBha=\r\ngavad Gita.  Beginning with devoted study of the Bhagavad Gita, \ncoupled wi=\r\nth daily meditation upon the Absolute under the expert \nguidance of an auth=\r\nentic spiritual teacher (guru), we can know the \nbliss of love of God.  \n\n\n=\r\n\nThe Author:\n\nDr. Frank Morales, Ph.D. (Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya) has =\r\nbeen a \npracticing American Hindu for over 30 years.
