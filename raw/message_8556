Please elaborate \n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rajarshi14&quot; =\r\n&lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Visitor: &quot;Honored sage, should we take the way =\r\nof monastic renunciation after our social and family responsibilities are c=\r\nompleted?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramakrishna: &quot;The path of monastic discipline is not necess=\r\nary for everyone who longs to awaken. The passion for external renunciation=\r\n is like a bolt of lightning. It may strike at any time. It is not a reason=\r\ned choice. But why not renounce all sense of limitation, even the limitatio=\r\nn of monastic forms? Why not enjoy all possible dimensions of human experie=\r\nnce as already merged in God? Can one get completely inebriated on just a f=\r\new pennies&#39; worth of wine? Fill up the whole pitcher!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; This radical re=\r\nsponse surprises the questioner, who had already tacitly assumed a traditio=\r\nnal, pious answer. He gazed, speechless, at the laughing sage, and then ask=\r\ns with astonishment: &quot;A spiritual practitioner should lead a worldly life?&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramakrishna: &quot;Why not? What is there to fear or avoid when Divine Rea=\r\nlity is know to be all-embracing=85 Relatively few persons have the destiny=\r\n to drop social and personal connections entirely in order to enter the ext=\r\nernal state of sannyasa - wandering aimlessly in the ecstasy of knowledge a=\r\nnd love, taking no direct responsibility for educating or serving society i=\r\nn pragmatic ways.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Visitor: &quot;Master, what does it mean to say that a p=\r\nerson has reached the end of worldly enjoyments?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramakrishna: &quot;=85To =\r\ncome to the end of worldly enjoyments is to EXPERIENCE Divine Bliss flowing=\r\n through EVERY ACTION, EVERY PERCEPTION.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Visitor: &quot;How can I get rid =\r\nof sexual passion?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramakrishna: &quot;Why get rid of it? Turn its powerful=\r\n energy in another direction. Lust is blind, but the Great Delight conferre=\r\nd by the Goddess is ever-pure and resplendent.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The new questioner is =\r\nalso disconcerted by such a radical response delivered with such wonderful =\r\nlaughter. This seeker has been conditioned by the teaching that cultivates =\r\nliberation by categorically rejecting what ever appears as ignorance, limit=\r\nation, or bondage. Intrigued by the relaxed, all-embracing tantric attitude=\r\n of the Goddess-worshiping sage, drawn deep into inquiry by this magnet of =\r\nDivine Mother&#39;s Knowledge and Love, this visible form of the dancing Kali-t=\r\nhe seeker cries in consternation: &quot;Please, most revered Master, why would a=\r\n benign Deity project the power of ignorance and limitation?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramakris=\r\nhna melts into laughter, his eyes swimming in ecstasy, his body, like burni=\r\nshed gold, glowing with heavenly light. This response emanates directly fro=\r\nm Mother Mahamaya, beyond reason, religion, philosophy. Now our Master is w=\r\neeping tears of pure love: &quot;It is ALL Her Play, Her delirious Play. OM KALI=\r\n, OM KALI, OM KALI!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Visitor: &quot;Beloved Paramahamsa, who is really to b=\r\nlame for sexual obsession and its bondage? Men or women?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramakrishna:=\r\n &quot;You are male, so I will speak to you about women. To women, I give the sa=\r\nme teachings about the spiritual danger and the spiritual potential of men.=\r\n A women who has awakened in her body and mind the energy of transcendent w=\r\nisdom, which is the brilliant healing and enlightening presence of the Godd=\r\ness, can be a tremendous blessing for a male practitioner - as a tantric co=\r\nnsort, as consecrated wife, or simply as the inspiring friend of his soul. =\r\nBut a woman who has developed exclusively her biological and social drives =\r\nis filled with a subtle energy that can be detrimental to the progress of a=\r\n male aspirant. Eventually - without either person recognizing any danger-s=\r\nhe can stifle his aspiration by drowning him in the forces of the limited e=\r\ngo world. Precisely the same facts must be explained to women concerning me=\r\nn...The brilliant feminine energy of wisdom, which incarnates through the b=\r\nodies and minds of both men and women, cultivates the refined taste for swe=\r\net spiritual companionship, for knowledge of oneness, for tears of pure lov=\r\ne, for ecstatic union with various revealed forms of Divinity, and for refr=\r\neshing renunciation of all deceptive, habitual expectations. By contrast, t=\r\nhe energy of limitation consists of the random, compulsive play of the mind=\r\n and senses with their objects - an instinctual drive for experience that l=\r\nacks both subtlety and harmony and causes the heart to forget the delight o=\r\nf Divine Reality, the communion that is natural to the human soul. But, bot=\r\nh currents - the energy of wisdom and the energy of limitation - are simply=\r\n Mother&#39;s Energy. When only God exists, who is there to praise and whom to =\r\nblame?&quot; (7)\n&gt; \n&gt; Copied from Lex Hixon&#39;s book, Great Swan: Meetings with Ra=\r\nmakrishna.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
