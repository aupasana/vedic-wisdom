I give you the\ncopied information from Wikipedia.\n\nAlex=\r\nandra David-N=E9el born Louise Eug=E9nie Alexandrine Marie David (born in\nS=\r\naint-Mand=E9, Val-de-Marne on 24 October 1868, and died in Digne-les-Bains,=\r\n on 8\nSeptember 1969) was a Belgian-French explorer,anarchist, spiritualist=\r\n, Buddhist\nand writer, most known for her visit to Lhasa, Tibet, in 1924, w=\r\nhen it was\nforbidden to foreigners. David-N=E9el wrote over 30 books about =\r\nEastern religion,\nphilosophy, and her travels. Her teachings influenced bea=\r\nt writers Jack Kerouac\nand Allen Ginsberg, philosopher Alan Watts, and Theo=\r\nsophistBenjamin Creme.\n[edit]Early life\n\nBorn in Paris in 1868, she moved t=\r\no Ixelles (Brussels) at the age of six. During\nher childhood she had a very=\r\n strong desire for freedom and spirituality. At the\nage of 18, she had alre=\r\nady visited England, Switzerland and Spain on her own,\nand she was studying=\r\n in Madame Blavatsky&#39;s Theosophical Society.\n\n***\nI took her as Paris born =\r\nand quoted what I got from the present 10000 Famous\nHoroscopes of JHora.\n\nR=\r\negards,\n\nJ.

Re-incarnation IS real, but identifying one&#39;s last incar=\r\nnation is difficult. Sri KN Rao collected some data of young people whose p=\r\nast life recollections were independently verified by researchers. He provi=\r\nded the birthdata, deathdata and rebirthdata of some reliable case studies.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I have done some work with it and am interested in all the data =\r\nI can get hands on. So thanks for your data. More than birthdata of the fir=\r\nst life, I am interested in deathdata (date, time and place of death). The =\r\nlast moment of life is an important one. It gives clues to the last thought=\r\n/desire, which is the foundation of the next life. Moreover, death data is =\r\neffectively birthdata of another existence, which will end when conception =\r\nfor rebirth occurs. Thus, if death chart is taken as the chart of an indepe=\r\nndent existence, rebirth (or rather conception for it) should show up as a =\r\nmajor major event in annual/monthly charts and transits. I have made some o=\r\nbservations before, but more work is needed.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In any case, this to=\r\npic better belongs to vedic-astrology list than vedic-wisdom list.

She said, she was intrigued with a wierd, vivid, hypnogogic dr=\r\neam,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; she had had last night.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; She saw herself sitting on =\r\nthe pulpit of a grave, in a grave yard, and read the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; following inscri=\r\nbed on the Cross in French: EUGENIE ALEXANDRINE, DIED: ON\n&gt; &gt; &gt; SEPTEMBER 8=\r\nTH 1969. She said that name was very familiar to her, though she had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nnever heard of it. On an impulse I checked Wikipedia, and there was a repor=\r\nt on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Alexandra David-Neel (Eugenie Alexandrine)died on September 8th =\r\n1969. She is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reported as a French Writer on Bhuddism, with more than =\r\n21 important works to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; her credit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My daughter was born o=\r\nn SEPTEMBER 8TH 1979. There is ten years gap, but some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; connectivity s=\r\neemed. Now she is a Dentist with Academic distinctions in French\n&gt; &gt; &gt; lang=\r\nuage. She has submitted many research works. She is fond of Budhism to the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extent of becoming a Budhist Nun. She has no inclination for marriage=\r\n or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; motherhood. There is exact facial resemblance too.
