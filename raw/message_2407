These spiritual truths  are  impersonal and not invented or written by any living being(apauruseya),  and therefore , universal.  They were discovered   by the &#39;scientists of religion&#39;, the mystics, the  sages,seers(RISHIS,Mantra Drashtas).   The authenticity of these truths lies in their being experienced by spiritual experimenters (sadhakas)  and in their being capable of re-verification by others.  Swamy Vivekananda  in his address at the Chicago Parliamaent of religions in 1893 explained the authenticity of the Vedas in the following words\nQuote\nBy the Vedas no books are meant; they mean the accumulated treasury of spiritual laws discovered by different persons in different times. Just as the law of gravitation existed  before its discovery, and would exist if all humanity forgot it, so is it with the laws that govern the spiritual world. The moral, ethical, and spiritual relation between soul and soul, and between individual spirit and the Father of all spirits, were there before their discovery, and would remain even if we forgot them. The discoverers of these laws are called rsis(sages), and we honour them as perfected beings. I am glad to tell this audience that some of the very greatest of them were women.\nUnquote\n\nThe above-mentioned description of eternal truths is relevant only with respect to the sruti  constituent of Hinduism.   The one difference between Hinduism and other religions is that this distinction  between the universality of the sruti and the limited relevance of the  smruti  is fully recognised and applied; and that social innovators and religious prophets are  honoured and followed.  And  for this blessing,  Hinduism owes it to its immortal literature of the  Upanishads,  which is all sruti and with no touch of smruti.  They are the only sacred books, both within Hinduism and outside of it, which addressed themselves exclusively to the discovery of  spiritual truths and to leading men, irrespective of caste, creed and race, to their realization in human life, and to the creation, in India, of a dynamic and healthy climate of active toleration and harmony as the inalienable characteristic of Indian culture, religion and life.\n(to be continued)\nG.Balasubramanian\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-318575211-1251883554=:69938\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:12pt;color:#000000;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Sruti&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/span&gt;constitutes the essential core of spiritual truths in Hindu Religion.&nbsp; These spiritual truths&nbsp; are&nbsp; impersonal and not invented or written by any living being(&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;apauruseya),&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp; and therefore , universal.&nbsp; They were discovered&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;by the &#39;scientists of religion&#39;, the mystics, the&nbsp; sages,seers&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;(RISHIS,Mantra Drashta&lt;/span&gt;s).&nbsp;&nbsp; The authenticity of these truths lies in their being experienced by spiritual experimenters &lt;/span&gt;(&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight:\n bold;&quot;&gt;sadhaka&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;s)&nbsp; and in their being capable of re-verification by others.&nbsp; Swamy Vivekananda&nbsp; in his address at the Chicago Parliamaent of religions in 1893 explained the authenticity of the Vedas in the following words&lt;br&gt;Quote&lt;br&gt;By the Vedas no books are meant; they mean the accumulated treasury of spiritual laws discovered by different persons in different times.
