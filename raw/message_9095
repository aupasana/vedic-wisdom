Why not accept \nwhatever comes our way as &#39;PRASAD&#39; from Isvara and =\r\nmove on.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nMy response: The final goal is indeed to reach a state of =\r\nmind where one can accept the fruits of all karmas as prasad of Lord, with =\r\nan equanimous mind. However, it is not easy. When we receive the fruits of =\r\nsome really terrible karmas, our mind gets so twisted and agitated that we =\r\nlose our balance and our judgment gets badly beated. This may result in fur=\r\nther bad karmas being committed in that agitated/confused state.\n=C2=A0\nThu=\r\ns, it IS sometimes useful to push off some really bad impending karmas when=\r\n one is still in a position to do so. If one reaches a calmer state of mind=\r\n in that borrowed time, one may be able to handle the bad fruits better. It=\r\n is even possible theoretically that one pushes off a really bad karma, mak=\r\nes progress during that borrowed time, reaches an equanimous state of mind,=\r\n becomes liberated and then faces the karma as a liberated being with a tot=\r\nally equanimous mind that does not get agitated.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nComment 2: Prarabda karma is which was already done and sanchitha and a=\r\ngami are what we going to do.\n=C2=A0\nMy Response: Actually sanchita karmas =\r\nare also karmas already done. Sanchita means &quot;piled up&quot;. Prarabdha karmas a=\r\nre different in the sense that their fructification has already begun. The =\r\nverb &quot;prArabh&quot; means &quot;to begin&quot;. Its noun form &quot;prArambha&quot; means &quot;beginning=\r\n&quot; and its gerund noun form &quot;prArabdha&quot; means &quot;the [one that was] begun&quot;. Pr=\r\narabdha karmas are actions for which the process of reaction has already be=\r\ngun and in the pipeline. Whereas sanchita karmas are piled up karmas that h=\r\nave not kicked off their fruits yet. They can be delayed indefinitely. If o=\r\nne becomes liberated while living, one can merge in Cosmic Self without exp=\r\neriencing the fruits of sanchita karmas. However, fruits of prarabdha karma=\r\ns are already in the pipeline and need to be experienced even by a liberate=\r\nd being.\n=C2=A0\nThough fruits of prarabdha karmas are already in the pipeli=\r\nne, even they can actually be delayed or manipulated. Bottomline is that th=\r\nere are agents of delivery at the physical and subtle level even for things=\r\n deep in the pipeline and hence some limited adjustment is possible.\n\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nComment 3:How does nishkam karma works? In othe=\r\nr words, when a doer detaches himself from an action, where does the reacti=\r\non goes?\n=C2=A0\nMy Response: If one identifies with a body-mind complex and=\r\n a limited sense of self-identification and pursues its selfish agenda, one=\r\n keeps accumulating karmas. But, if one has minimal identification with a b=\r\nody-mind complex to just sustain it, pursues no agenda and engages in whate=\r\nver action is natural in the situation one is in (but not driven by any con=\r\nditioning, i.e.agendas or desires or likes/dislikes), then one is untouched=\r\n by karmas performed in that state.\n=C2=A0\nIn the words of Swami Sivananda =\r\nof Hrishikesh, &quot;The accumulated and current actions of a Jnani take shelter=\r\n in Brahmanda Prakriti&quot;. In other words, Sanchita karmas (piled up actions =\r\nfrom past that have not yet begun fructifying) and aagami karmas (actions b=\r\neing performed right now) of a liberated being take shelted in Cosmic Kinet=\r\nic Consciousness (Brahmanda Prakriti).\n\n=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nCommen=\r\nt 4: If my destiny is to suffer, why should I pray to God? And if i am bein=\r\ng \npunished for some kind of bad karma from the past, why am i not aware of=\r\n it? It is like getting punishment without knowing your bad deeds.\n=C2=A0\nM=\r\ny Response: One need not pray to God.All one needs to do is to stop engagin=\r\ng in problematic karmas to add to the pile of such karmas from the past. Mo=\r\nre importantly, one needs to reach a calm and sustainable state of mind in =\r\nwhich that can be maintained even in the middle of a tumultous hurricane ca=\r\nused in one&#39;s life due to serious bad karmas from the past. Once serious tr=\r\noubles set in or mind focuses on sense objects, material world and one&#39;s pl=\r\neasures and pains, mind tends to lose its balance and judgment, starts purs=\r\nuing its limited selfish agendas and starts performing even more bad karmas=\r\n. Thus, praying to God and contemplating various ideals and qualities that =\r\nGod represents can give a shelter to the mind in which it can maintain some=\r\n calmness, balance and judgment. If that is not the case for one, perhaps o=\r\nne needs to perfect it further.\n=C2=A0\nGod has no agenda to either punish y=\r\nou or hide the reason. God is an impartial balancer of reactions to all act=\r\nions. If there is something unreasonable about the reaction you are getting=\r\n, it means your action had a similar unreasonableness.\n\n=C2=A0Let me turn a=\r\nround your question on being &quot;aware&quot; and ask a simple question. When we cau=\r\nse loss or hurt to someone, do we always tell that person why we are doing =\r\nit? If not, how can we expect someone to tell us before causing loss or hur=\r\nt to us? If I caused terrible strife to someone pious and pure for no reaso=\r\nn, then Nature will use someone in future to cause terrible strife to me de=\r\nspite my piety and purity and apparently for no reason.\n=C2=A0\nIn fact, wha=\r\nt will you achieve by knowing exactly what was the action that caused what =\r\nis happening to you right now? Why is that useful? More useful is your cons=\r\ncience (a representation of God in each heart) that tells you right from wr=\r\nong. It constantly gives guidance on which actions will give good reactions=\r\n *in future*.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nComment 5: Vasana can be for wea=\r\nlth, fame, power, domination (a struggle for power!) etc.Many ripus, many r=\r\neasons...!\n=C2=A0\nMy Response: Well-said. Though we are discussing karma an=\r\nd karma phala here, the root cause of karma is vasana in chittaakasha. (Chi=\r\ndaakaasha is the space of pure consciousness and chittaakaasha is the space=\r\n of conditioned consciousness that has likes, dislikes, desires, agendas et=\r\nc.) Vasishtha defined liberation as overcoming vasanas in Yoga Vaasishtham =\r\nand Patanjali defined yoga as &quot;chitta vR^itti nirodhaH yogaH&quot; (resisting th=\r\ne working of conditioning is oneness with Cosmic Self) in Yoga Sutras. Unti=\r\nl we overcome our vasanas, we are bound. Some are dense and some are very s=\r\nubtle. But all of them bind us.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nComment 6:1.=\r\n As per Shri Vimalananda, you may also offer all the karmas as Homa to inne=\r\nr \ndevas or ishta devta? He mentioned that there is lesser of suffering if =\r\n\nyou do that. Who gets the remaining delta suffering?\n=C2=A0\nMy Response: K=\r\narmaphala for a specific karma is not a function of that karma alone. It is=\r\n a function of that karma and one&#39;s current state of mind. If someone serve=\r\ns spoiled food, one may get an upset stomach for half day or diaria for a w=\r\neek. It depends on how strong one is. Similarly, the same karmaphala set in=\r\n motion by the same external agents of delivery (physical & subtle) can cau=\r\nse different reaction inside one, depending on one&#39;s current state of mind.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nAn idle mind is devil&#39;s workshop. Our minds keep vibrating with var=\r\nious notions and thoughts. A mind vibrating with selfish desires and unnece=\r\nssary clutter/confusion *amplifies* the negative effects of one&#39;s environme=\r\nnt (through which fruits of karmas are administered).\n=C2=A0\nIf one thinks =\r\nof ishta devata with reverence and contemplates various ideals and qualitie=\r\ns of ishta devata and mind vibrates with saattwik energy, it absorbs the ne=\r\ngative effects of one&#39;s environment better or atleast does not amplify them=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resource=\r\ns: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt;_____________________=\r\n___________\n&gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

I will add my 2 cents.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0The cosmos runs based on the fundament=\r\nal law that each action (karma) gives a reaction/result (karmaphala) commen=\r\nsurate with it. Shakti is the sum total of all the beings with various agen=\r\ndas engaging in various karmas and experiencing various karmaphalas. Purush=\r\na is the witness of it all.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Though each karma should give karmapha=\r\nla that is commensurate with it, that requires an *agent* to deliver the ka=\r\nrmaphala, i.e. another being. So this requires a complicated balancing act =\r\non part of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are=\r\n very complicated rules that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and pic=\r\nking of agents for their delivery.\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;At any time, some karmas from=\r\n one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;must experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool,=\r\n some karmas in a &quot;preferably experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool and =\r\nthe rest in the third pool which may not be experienced anytime soon. The w=\r\nay karmas are assigned and ordered in these pools is based on the balancing=\r\n of karma/karmaphala sequencing of all beings.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;The assignment and =\r\nordering of these pools will constantly undergo churn as one engages in var=\r\nious new actions and adds them to the pools. Also, as new people enter one&#39;=\r\ns life, possibilities in terms of karmaphala delivery agents and sequencing=\r\n may change and hence the pools may be re-arranged.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;As one engages in remedial measures such as prayers, fasting, do=\r\nnations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, change one&#39;s vulnerabilities o=\r\nr re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings (including planets, deities e=\r\ntc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of karmaphala, who operate throug=\r\nh other people who act as physical agents of delivery!). The karma pools ma=\r\ny be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirable karmas may be downgraded to =\r\na lower pool or pushed down in order within the same pool. Or, some desirab=\r\nle karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or pushed up in order within the=\r\n same pool.\n&gt;=C2=A0When someone curses or blesses one, with sufficient ment=\r\nal force behind it (this is the key), the same thing can happen. It is all =\r\nabout re-arranging karmas between the karmik pools. Every action by one, or=\r\n even people around one, has the potential to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik pools=\r\n. A karma about to give karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was not=\r\n to give karmaphala anytime soon may be advanced sooner.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;However, =\r\nremember that the remedial measure has to be as intense as the karma that i=\r\nt is trying to manipulate. You can move a small rock with small force, but =\r\nyou need a large force to move a big rock or a hill.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;If there is=\r\n no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a specific result, nobody ca=\r\nn make one experience that result, no matter what ritual one does. However,=\r\n even great souls have a lot of negative karmas in their optional pool and =\r\neven evil people have a lot of positive karmas in their optional pool, and =\r\nhence powerful remedies, curses and blessings can often make some differenc=\r\ne.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;This point is well illustrated by the &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Dig=\r\namber ji referred in his point (3).\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;If o=\r\nne thinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s actions, one is mistakene=\r\nd. God is not like us human beings, who may show favoritism towards those w=\r\nho praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God is a witness to the play=\r\n of actions and fruits. The She-aspect of God is the power that impartially=\r\n and impassionately manages the fine balance and order within this play of =\r\nactions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her eyes, from the lowest of ev=\r\nil persons to the noblest of saints. She administers just and balanced deli=\r\nvery of fruits to actions using available agents.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;The karmas we co=\r\nmmitted in the past are already in the pipeline and will give their results=\r\n sooner or later. The best we can do with them, with some effort, is to per=\r\nhaps reorder them somewhat. The most important thing is to not add more ser=\r\nious bad karmas to the pipeline now.

I vaguel=\r\ny remember Vimalananda mentioning something about a Saint&#39;s curse in Aghora=\r\n trilogy.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;(2) On similar note, what happens when you get `blessings&#39; say=\r\n from a saint or elders? We also come across lot of tantric items like Rudr=\r\naksha, Parad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =E2=80=93 what do this it=\r\nems really do if they work? Something similar with wearing gemstones for pl=\r\nanets =E2=80=93 do they bring forward good karmas or they create new ones?\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;(3) I recollect an episode from famous &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well known in Mah=\r\narashtra), wherein a just widowed lady cried out to Shri Guru &quot;If we cannot=\r\n change `parabdha, then, why do we worship God at all&quot;. At that point Shri =\r\nGuru rejuvenates her dead husband, but later tells his shisya, that he has =\r\nonly readjusted the karma from next birth. [Please excuse me if this is not=\r\n exact word to word, as I am trying to recollect this episode from old memo=\r\nry].

H=\r\nowever, it is not easy. When we receive the fruits of some really terrible =\r\nkarmas, our mind gets so twisted and agitated that we lose our balance and =\r\nour judgment gets badly beated. This may result in further bad karmas being=\r\n committed in that agitated/confused state.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Thus, it IS someti=\r\nmes useful to push off some really bad impending karmas when one is still i=\r\nn a position to do so. If one reaches a calmer state of mind in that borrow=\r\ned time, one may be able to handle the bad fruits better. It is even possib=\r\nle theoretically that one pushes off a really bad karma, makes progress dur=\r\ning that borrowed\n time, reaches an equanimous state of mind, becomes liber=\r\nated and then faces the karma as a liberated being with a totally equanimou=\r\ns mind that does not get agitated.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: ital=\r\nic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style=\r\n: italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Comment 2&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv4326=\r\n91898yui_3_7_2_18_1362375052103_47&quot;&gt;Prarabda karma is which was already don=\r\ne and sanchitha and agami are what we going to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;My Respo=\r\nnse&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Actually sanchita karmas are also karmas already done. S=\r\nanchita means &quot;piled up&quot;. Prarabdha karmas are different in the sense that =\r\ntheir fructification has\n &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;already begun=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;. The verb &quot;prArabh&quot; means &quot;to begin&quot;. Its noun form &quot;prArambha&quot; mea=\r\nns &quot;beginning&quot; and its gerund noun form &quot;prArabdha&quot; means &quot;the [one that wa=\r\ns] begun&quot;. Prarabdha karmas are actions for which the process of reaction h=\r\nas already begun and in the pipeline. Whereas sanchita karmas are piled up =\r\nkarmas that have not kicked off their fruits yet. They can be delayed indef=\r\ninitely. If one becomes liberated while living, one can merge in Cosmic Sel=\r\nf without experiencing the fruits of sanchita karmas. However, fruits of pr=\r\narabdha karmas are already in the pipeline and need to be experienced even =\r\nby a liberated being.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Though fruits of prarabdha karmas are al=\r\nready in the pipeline, even they can actually be delayed or manipulated. Bo=\r\nttomline is that there are agents of delivery at the physical and subtle le=\r\nvel even for things deep in the pipeline and hence some limited adjustment =\r\nis possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div\n style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-famil=\r\ny:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-sty=\r\nle:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Comment 3&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family: arial,=\r\nhelvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 13px=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;How does &lt;i&gt;nishkam karma&lt;/i&gt; works?

But, i=\r\nf one has minimal identification with a body-mind complex to just sustain i=\r\nt, pursues no agenda and engages in whatever action is natural in the situa=\r\ntion one is in (but not driven by any conditioning, i.e. agendas or desires=\r\n or likes/dislikes), then one is untouched by karmas performed in that stat=\r\ne.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In the words of Swami Sivananda of Hrishikesh, &quot;The accumul=\r\nated and current actions of a Jnani take shelter in Brahmanda Prakriti&quot;. In=\r\n other words, Sanchita karmas (piled up actions from past that have not yet=\r\n begun fructifying) and aagami karmas (actions being performed right now) o=\r\nf a liberated being take shelted in\n Cosmic Kinetic Consciousness (Brahmand=\r\na Prakriti).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: ita=\r\nlic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-styl=\r\ne: italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Comment 4&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If my destiny is to suffer, why should I pray to God? An=\r\nd if i am being \npunished for some kind of bad karma from the past, why am =\r\ni not aware of\n it? It is like getting punishment without knowing your bad =\r\ndeeds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night: bold;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;My Response&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;One &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;need not pray to God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=\r\n All one needs to do is to stop engaging in problematic karmas to add to th=\r\ne pile of such karmas from the past. More importantly, one needs to reach a=\r\n calm and sustainable state of mind in which that can be maintained even in=\r\n the middle of a tumultous hurricane caused in one&#39;s life due to serious ba=\r\nd karmas from the past. Once serious troubles set in or mind focuses on sen=\r\nse objects, material world and one&#39;s pleasures and pains, mind tends to los=\r\ne its balance and judgment, starts pursuing its limited selfish agendas and=\r\n starts performing even more bad karmas. Thus, praying to God and contempla=\r\nting various ideals and qualities that God represents can give a shelter to=\r\n the mind in\n which it can maintain some calmness, balance and judgment. If=\r\n that is not the case for one, perhaps one needs to perfect it further.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;God has =\r\nno agenda to either punish you or hide the reason. God is an impartial bala=\r\nncer of reactions to all actions. If there is something unreasonable about =\r\nthe reaction you are getting, it means your action had a similar unreasonab=\r\nleness.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span=\r\n&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:=\r\n italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let m=\r\ne turn around your question on being &quot;aware&quot; and ask a simple question. Whe=\r\nn we cause loss or hurt to someone, do we always tell that person why we ar=\r\ne doing it? If not, how can we expect someone to tell us before causing los=\r\ns or hurt to\n us? If I caused terrible strife to someone pious and pure for=\r\n no reason, then Nature will use someone in future to cause terrible strife=\r\n to me despite my piety and purity and apparently for no reason.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;In fact, what will you achieve by knowing exactly what was the action th=\r\nat caused what is happening to you right now? Why is that useful? More usef=\r\nul is your conscience (a representation of God in each heart) that tells yo=\r\nu right from wrong. It constantly gives guidance on which actions will give=\r\n good reactions *in future*.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: =\r\nitalic;&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-s=\r\ntyle: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span=\r\n\n style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;Comment 5&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Vasana can be for wealth, fame, power, dominatio=\r\nn (a struggle for power!) etc. Many ripus, many reasons...!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;My Response&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well-sa=\r\nid. Though we are discussing karma and karma phala here, the root cause of =\r\nkarma is vasana in chittaakasha. (Chidaakaasha is the space of pure conscio=\r\nusness and chittaakaasha is the space of conditioned consciousness that has=\r\n likes, dislikes, desires, agendas etc.) Vasishtha defined liberation as ov=\r\nercoming vasanas in Yoga Vaasishtham and Patanjali defined yoga as &quot;chitta =\r\nvR^itti nirodhaH yogaH&quot; (resisting the working of conditioning is\n &lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;oneness=\r\n with Cosmic Self&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) in Yoga Sutras. Until we ove=\r\nrcome our vasanas, we are bound. Some are dense and some are very subtle.

A mind v=\r\nibrating with selfish desires and unnecessary clutter/confusion *amplifies*=\r\n the negative effects of one&#39;s environment (through which fruits of karmas =\r\nare\n administered).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If one thinks of ishta devata with reveren=\r\nce and contemplates various ideals and qualities of ishta devata and mind v=\r\nibrates with saattwik energy, it absorbs the negative effects of one&#39;s envi=\r\nronment better or at least does not amplify them.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards=\r\n,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a re=\r\nl=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);fon=\r\nt-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-colo=\r\nr:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockqu=\r\note style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; mar=\r\ngin-top: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: arial, helve=\r\ntica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new r=\r\noman, new york, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;Arial&quot;\n size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bo=\r\nld;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha P.V.R.

Shakti is the sum total of all the beings with various agen=\r\ndas engaging in various karmas and experiencing various karmaphalas. Purush=\r\na is the witness of it all.&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Though each karma should g=\r\nive karmaphala that is commensurate with it, that requires an *agent* to de=\r\nliver the karmaphala, i.e. another\n being. So this\n requires a complicated =\r\nbalancing act on part of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shak=\r\nti). There are very complicated rules that decide the *sequencing* of karma=\r\nphalas and picking of agents for their delivery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;At any time, some karmas from one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;must &lt;/span&gt;experience karmaphala in this life&quot; poo=\r\nl, some karmas in a &quot;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;preferably &lt;/span&gt;e=\r\nxperience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool and the rest in the third pool whic=\r\nh may not be experienced anytime soon. The way karmas are assigned and orde=\r\nred in these pools is based on the balancing of karma/karmaphala sequencing=\r\n of all beings.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The assignment and ordering of t=\r\nhese pools will constantly undergo churn as one engages in various new acti=\r\nons and adds them to the pools. Also, as new people enter one&#39;s life, possi=\r\nbilities in terms of karmaphala delivery agents\n and sequencing may change =\r\nand hence the pools may be re-arranged.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;*&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp; *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As one engages in remedial measures such =\r\nas prayers, fasting, donations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, change =\r\none&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings (inclu=\r\nding planets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of karmaph=\r\nala, who operate through other people who act as physical agents of deliver=\r\ny!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirable karma=\r\ns may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order within the same=\r\n pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or pushed=\r\n up in order within the same pool.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;When someone curse=\r\ns or blesses one, with &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;sufficient &lt;/span=\r\n&gt;mental force behind it (this is the key),\n the same thing &lt;span&gt;can &lt;/span=\r\n&gt;happen. It is all about re-arranging karmas between the karmik pools. Ever=\r\ny action by one, or even people around one, has the &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-sty=\r\nle:italic;&quot;&gt;potential &lt;/span&gt;to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma abou=\r\nt to give karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was not to give karma=\r\nphala anytime soon may be advanced sooner.&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;However, re=\r\nmember that the remedial measure has to be as intense as the karma that it =\r\nis trying to manipulate. You can move a small rock with small force, but yo=\r\nu need a large force to move a big rock or a hill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\nIf there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a &lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-style:italic;&quot;&gt;specific &lt;/span&gt;result, nobody can make one experience =\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;that &lt;/span&gt;result, no matter what ritua=\r\nl one does. However, even great souls have a lot of negative karmas in thei=\r\nr optional pool and even evil people\n have a lot of positive karmas in thei=\r\nr optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and blessings can ofte=\r\nn make some difference.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This point is well illus=\r\ntrated by the &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his point (3).&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If one=\r\n thinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s actions, one is mistakened.=\r\n God is not like us human beings, who may show favoritism towards those who=\r\n praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God is a witness to the play o=\r\nf actions and fruits. The She-aspect of God is the power that impartially a=\r\nnd impassionately manages the fine balance and order within this play of ac=\r\ntions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her eyes, from the lowest of evil=\r\n persons to the noblest of saints. She administers just and balanced delive=\r\nry of fruits to actions using\n available agents.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\nThe karmas we committed in the past are already in the pipeline and will gi=\r\nve their results sooner or later. The best we can do with them, with some e=\r\nffort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most important thing is to =\r\nnot add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:i=\r\ntalic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;span&gt;ow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; Simply put, selfish actions a=\r\nnd actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad karmas and selfless ac=\r\ntions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to others are good karmas.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to manipulating the pre-existing pipeline of ka=\r\nrmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort and current action, yes,=\r\n it is possible and general guidelines are available in shastras, but we ca=\r\nn&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each action. One thing is for s=\r\nure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has to be commensurate with t=\r\nhe karma\n itself.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;You need only small force to push a cat out =\r\nof your way, but need a large force to push an elephant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;c=\r\nolor:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-=\r\nserif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regar=\r\nds,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a =\r\nrel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;=\r\n&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);f=\r\nont-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-co=\r\nlor:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquot=\r\ne style=3D&quot;border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);margin-left:5px;margin-to=\r\np:5px;padding-left:5px;&quot;&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans=\r\n-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new yor=\r\nk, times, serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; si=\r\nze=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Tuesday, February 26, 2013 1=\r\n1:29 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] few questions&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1788388150&quot;=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;di=\r\nv id=3D&quot;yiv1788388150ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;Dear&nbsp;Digambe=\r\nr,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special el=\r\nephant was appointed by the courtiers to randomly pick the next king. Thus,=\r\n it was possible for a beggar to suddenly find himself the king. Whose karm=\r\na is this?&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vasishtha gives two answers: (1=\r\n) This is the karma of the ministers, king, and all the citizens, and (2) T=\r\nhis is the karma of the beggar turned king.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Everyt=\r\nhing is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s karma made him a king. The elephant&#39;s ka=\r\nrma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the king. The minister&#39;s karma=\r\n allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the king. And the citizens&#39; k=\r\narma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and accept the result.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, o=\r\nr oath. Many of the curses that we see are for the benefit of mankind, and =\r\nare actually blessings. At the end of the day, some people with a certain a=\r\nmount of purity of speech discharge their tapas shakti through speech.&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When it comes to people and their karmic pipeline, w=\r\ne usually make an assumption. We assume that there is a person, and separat=\r\ne from the person are his many karmas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the perso=\r\nn from time to time. We then want someone to come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; =\r\nkarmas from our karmic pipeline.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vasishtha teach=\r\nes us that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You are your karmas. =\r\nAnd you are nothing but your mind-impressions ... your vaasanaas. In other =\r\nwords, your vaasanaas are your karmas.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you ca=\r\nn change your vaasanaas, you have changed your karma. Or course, that is ea=\r\nsier said than done.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Any moment when your mind bec=\r\nomes quiet is a blessing. Any moment when your mind becomes agitated is a c=\r\nurse.

I vaguely remember Vimalana=\r\nnda mentioning something about a Saint&#39;s curse in Aghora trilogy.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n(2)=\r\n On similar note, what happens when you get `blessings&#39; say from a saint or=\r\n elders? We also come across lot of tantric items like Rudraksha, Parad Shi=\r\nvalinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =E2=80=93 what do this items really do if=\r\n they work? Something similar with wearing gemstones for planets =E2=80=93 =\r\ndo they bring forward good karmas or they create new ones?&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n(3) I reco=\r\nllect an episode from famous &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well known in Maharashtra), wh=\r\nerein a just widowed lady cried out to Shri Guru &quot;If we cannot change `para=\r\nbdha, then, why do we worship God at all&quot;. At that point Shri Guru rejuvena=\r\ntes her dead husband, but later tells his shisya, that he has only readjust=\r\ned the karma from next birth. [Please excuse me if this is not exact word t=\r\no word, as I am trying to recollect this episode from old memory]. So quest=\r\nion I have is, does our sadhana change karmaphal to a great extent or it is=\r\n just our perception that changes?&lt;br&gt;\n\n\nThanking you,&lt;br&gt;\nDigamber&lt;br&gt; &lt;/b=\r\nlockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockqu=\r\note&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  =\r\n &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--61789334-1882619420-1362458030=:48436--\r\n\n"}}
