In other words:\nHinduism versus X.\n\nThe goal =\r\nof your paper must be to demonstratively establish the preeminence of\nSanat=\r\nana Dharma over the non-Dharmic philosophical proposition you are comparing=\r\n\nit to. We are not interested in purely historical, hagiographical, philolo=\r\ngical,\nor needlessly abstract papers =96 but only papers that directly inte=\r\nrface Sanatana\nDharma with modernity in a polemically engaged manner.\n\nYou =\r\ncan submit papers online at: http://dharmacivilization.com/submissions/\n\nTh=\r\ne Center for the Study of Dharma and Civilization (CSDC) is the very first\n=\r\nacademic think tank of the Sanatana Dharma tradition ever created in Americ=\r\nan\nhistory. Established by Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya (Ph.D.) in May of =\r\n2002, the CSDC\nbrings together several of the most prominent Hindu scholars=\r\n in America with the\nsingular purpose of academically affirming the preemin=\r\nence of the philosophy,\npractice and culture of Sanatana Dharma in the inte=\r\nllectual realm.\n\nPlease share this important information.\n\nAum Tat Sat\n\n\n"}}
