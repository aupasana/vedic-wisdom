Yes, pride can return in many forms. Ironically, as you said, one ca=\r\nn be proud of one&#39;s apparent humility also, in which case that apparent hum=\r\nility is a facade.\n \nOnly when the seed of ego is sufficiently fried in the=\r\n heat of self-realization is the chance of it giving rise to the tree of pr=\r\nide ruled out completely.\n \n&gt; Intellect is disliked because it questions. A=\r\nnd when the answers\n&gt; are not comfortable with our existing beliefs we find=\r\n excuse to\n&gt; quite our mind.\n \nThe problem with intellect is not that it qu=\r\nestions. The problem with it is that it has no answers to the highest quest=\r\nions.\n \nLogical and analytical thinking is a function of pingala/surya nadi=\r\n. Emotional and intuitive thinking and beliefs are a function of ida/chandr=\r\na nadi. Neither is sufficient to reveal the absolute. Various higher beings=\r\n exist within the sushumna nadi in the middle. The absorption in the absolu=\r\nte is at the end of it.\n \nI am not telling people to become stupid or throw=\r\n their intellect in ganges. I am only pointing out that regular intelligenc=\r\ne is insufficient to realize the absolute.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Hom=\r\nam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yoursel=\r\nf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.=\r\ncomcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------- \n \n&gt; Hi PVR,\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI disagree here. Intellect is disliked because it questions. And when the a=\r\nnswers are not comfortable with our existing beliefs we find excuse to quit=\r\ne our mind. There are many ways to find God. Intellect never hinders. The s=\r\name way pride also has many disguise. One can be proud of humility or one&#39;s=\r\n devotion to god as well. \n&gt; \n&gt; So saying such a thing actually confuses pe=\r\nople and set wrong beliefs in mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Siya.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste=\r\n friends,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Intellectual prowess is helpful in some matters, but it=\r\n cannot make one understand or experience god. On the contrary, it can even=\r\n increase pride, which makes it more difficult to experience god.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Swami Vivekananda had one of the sharpest intellects in the world in the l=\r\nast few centuries. The following is a nice quote from him. Just something t=\r\no ponder..\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------\n&gt; &gt; From http://www.ramakr=\r\nishnavivekananda.info/vivekananda/volume_9/conversations_and_interviews.htm=\r\n (search for &quot;Edith Allan&quot;)\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------\n&gt; &gt; SWAMI VIVEK=\r\nANANDA: I am the disciple of a man who could not write his own name, and I =\r\nam not worthy to undo his shoes. How often have I wished I could take my in=\r\ntellect and throw it into the Ganges!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; STUDENT: But, Swami, that i=\r\ns the part of you I like best.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; SWAMI VIVEKANANDA: That is because=\r\n you are a fool, Madam =C3=A2?&quot; like I am.\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The thing with Vivekananda is that he was not only a sharp thinke=\r\nr, but was a fearless and brutally honest speaker.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Though intelli=\r\ngence can help one understand some scriptural teachings better and help in =\r\nthe sadhana in the beginning, it is not so useful after a while. The qualit=\r\nies of surrender and humility are far more valuable than logic and analytic=\r\nal thinking.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; BTW, I noted that he said in the same series that he=\r\n has to come back once more with his Master Ramakrishna. Of course, Ramakri=\r\nshna also said that he would come back after 100 years along with everybody=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ve=\r\ndic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.n=\r\net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; -------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
