Can =\r\na homam\n&gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand base be used inste=\r\nad of a\n&gt; copper one?\n\nYes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the ope=\r\nn is actually better than doing it in closed space. But realize that a rain=\r\n can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect the fire if it rain=\r\ns while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain=\r\n in the middle of a homam.\n\nYes, you can construct a homa kundam with brick=\r\ns and sand at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n\n&gt; 2)While perfor=\r\nming the Homam using the mp3 audio file, should one repeat the\n&gt; mantras me=\r\nntally along with the audio?\n\nOne can repeat mentally while listening atten=\r\ntively (not casually). Actually, even listening to mantras with all the att=\r\nention focused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n\nSuppose person X is chant=\r\ning a mantra and thinking of some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose perso=\r\nn Y is listening to it with focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity.=\r\n Then the mantra may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit f=\r\nrom the mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;. One can=\r\n say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is control ov=\r\ner the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.\n\nHowever, there is =\r\na difference between meditation and homam. Mantra is submitted in the inter=\r\nnal fire in meditation and it is submitted in the external fire as well in =\r\na homam. So making some external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as o=\r\npposed to silent chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n\n&gt; 3)Can=\r\n bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other conditions/niyamas that\n&gt; shou=\r\nld be followed apart from having vegeterain food?\n\nYes. Anybody whose upana=\r\nyanam (sacred thread ceremony) has been performed can do it. Bachelor or ma=\r\nrried is irrelevant.\n\nOne should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s =\r\nguru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them strictly. At t=\r\nhe minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food on the day of homam and tak=\r\ne a bath before homam. Another rule I will recommend is to avoid eating any=\r\n solid food 2 hours before homam.\n\nBy the way, if one without a sacred thre=\r\nad wants to do homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take responsib=\r\nility and allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as =\r\nguru and perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in the p=\r\nrocess until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of purity through h=\r\nomam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no sacred thread, mant=\r\nropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not matter after a while, when the per=\r\nson crosses a threshhold of purity. The goal of upanayanam and other mantro=\r\npadesa by guru is to speed this up and make the person cross the threshhold=\r\n of purity.\n\nAs long as one desires no specific material benefits (and read=\r\ny to receive whatever god gives) and does homam for spiritual progress, I a=\r\nm willing to help, even if it means some suffering for me.\n\n&gt; 4)Any good da=\r\nte to start the Homam? or any day would be fine?\n\nFor Mahaganapathi homam, =\r\nthe best is a Chaturthi morning. But any day is fine really.\n\n* * *\n\nMentio=\r\nning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India trip.\n\nWhen I went to I=\r\nndia in May 2008, I and my guru Manish traveled together to several places =\r\n(on a specific project). We ended up doing homam in the morning in several =\r\nplaces (wherever we were). Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umb=\r\nrella with me. As monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not take =\r\nit seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May. We proceeded to the rooftop =\r\nof the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. Manish told me, &quot;Narasi=\r\nmha, it is going to rain heavily in this city after our homam finishes&quot;. I =\r\njust smiled.\n\nTo my surprise, it did rain as soon as our homas finished. Af=\r\nter we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly started raining with really big dro=\r\nps. Luckily, there was a small towel/blanket on the rooftop close to us. To=\r\ngether, we held it on top of the two small homa kundas, closed our eyes and=\r\n meditated. We held the cloth cover on the homa kundas until fire in the tw=\r\no homa kundas went off and then packed everything and went down. We left fo=\r\nr Kurukshetra later that day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued =\r\nfor a few days in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we c=\r\novered the north, east and west of India. It rained in every place we went =\r\nto, as we finished our task in that place and prepared to move on.\n\nBest re=\r\ngards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo=\r\n Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://=\r\nwww.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- -\n\n---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Na=\r\nmasthe,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and have f=\r\new questions\n&gt; regarding it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top =\r\nof a house(3-floors) ?
