Devotee\nM. Ramana Maharshi\n\nD.: Aurobindo d=\r\noes not approve of castes. Do you approve of them?\n\nM.: As for Aurobindo, y=\r\nou ask him. As for my opinion, how does it matter to\nyou? How will it be of=\r\n use to you? Have you got any opinion on the matter?\nThat alone will affect=\r\n you, not the opinion of others.\n\nD.: I do not approve of the caste system.=\r\n Mahatma=E2=80=99s opinion is valuable as a\nguidance. I want your blessings=\r\n in my attempts.\n\nM.: Mahatma has told you to seek and find your Self. You =\r\nwill not do it but\nrequire his blessings.\n\nD.: I am trying to follow the in=\r\nstructions. But caste-distinction is\npainful. It must go.\n\nM.: To whom does=\r\n it cause pain?\n\nD.: The members of the society...\n\nM.: It is you who say i=\r\nt. There are countries where there are no such\ndistinctions of caste. Are t=\r\nhey free from trouble? There are\nwars,internecine struggle, etc. Why do you=\r\n not remedy the evils there?\n\nD.: There are troubles here also.\n\nM.: Differ=\r\nences are always there. There are not only human beings, but also\nanimals, =\r\nplants, etc. The state of affairs cannot be helped.\n\nD.: We do not mind the=\r\n animals, etc., at present.\n\nM.: Why not? If they could speak they would cl=\r\naim equality with you and\ndispute your claims no less vigorously than human=\r\n beings.\n\nD.: But we cannot help it. It is God=E2=80=99s work.\n\nM.: If that=\r\n is God=E2=80=99s work then the other part is your work, is that so?\n\nD.: I=\r\nt is man-made distinction.\n\nM.: You need not notice these distinctions. The=\r\nre is diversity in the\nworld. A unity runs through the diversity. The Self =\r\nis the same in all. There\nis no difference in spirit. All the differences a=\r\nre external and\nsuperficial. You find out the Unity and be happy.\n\nThe pain=\r\n of diversity is overcome by the joy of the perception of unity.\nMoreover, =\r\na king may disguise himself as a servant. That makes no difference\nin the p=\r\nerson.\n\nD.: I do not object to differences. But the claims of superiority a=\r\nre wrong.\n\nM.: There are differences in the limbs of one=E2=80=99s body. Wh=\r\nen the hand touches\nthe foot the hand is not defiled. Each limb performs it=\r\ns function. Why do\nyou object to differences?\n\nD.: The people feel the inju=\r\nstice of caste distinction. It must be rooted\nout.\n\nM.: You can individuall=\r\ny arrive at the state where such distinctions are not\nperceived and be happ=\r\ny. How can you hope to reform the world? Even if you\ntry you cannot succeed=\r\n. Kavyakantha Ganapati Sastri offered to initiate\nHarijans with mantras and=\r\n make Brahmins of them. But the Harijans did not\ncome forward to accept the=\r\n offer.\nThat shows they are themselves afflicted by an inferiority complex.=\r\n\n\nRemove that complex first before you try to reform others.\n\nMoreover, why=\r\n do you go to places where such distinctions are observed and\ncause pain to=\r\n yourself? Why should you not seek places where they are not\nobserved and b=\r\ne happy there?\n\nGandhiji also tries to bring about equality. He is also up =\r\nagainst the\nbarrier of inferiority complex afflicting the lower orders. He =\r\ncannot\nenforce his views on others. He observes non-violence. So matters st=\r\nand as\nthey are.\n\nD.: We must work to obliterate caste-distinctions.\n\nM.: T=\r\nhen do it. If you have succeeded in the world, then see if the\ndistinctions=\r\n persist in this place.\n\nD.: This must be the first place where I want to e=\r\nffect the reform.\n\nM.: Why do you exert yourself so much to effect reforms?=\r\n Go to sleep and see\nif there are differences. There you obliterate differe=\r\nnces without any\neffort. (Laughter).\n\nExternal differences are bound to per=\r\nsist, however hard we may try to\nobliterate them. The attempts of so-called=\r\n social reformers, to do away with\nsuch classes or divisions as varnasrama =\r\nhas created, have not succeeded, but\nhave only created new divisions and ad=\r\nded a few more castes or classes to\nthe already existing ones, such as the =\r\nBrahmo-Samajists and the\nArya-Samajists.\n\nThe only solution is for each man=\r\n to realise his true nature.\n\nSource: Talks With Ramana Maharshi Book\n\n-- \n=\r\n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636b2af639fb34e0482c24370\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;22nd August, 1938&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talk 507&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;D.
