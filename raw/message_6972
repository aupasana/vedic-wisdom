I got the book last year, but i still haven&#39;=\r\nt started reading.\nThe reason being i&#39;ve come across all your posts and peo=\r\nple responding to your posts, i.e whether a person who has not been initiat=\r\ned could read or should not read. I&#39;m not able to conclude, even now i&#39;m re=\r\nading the post and text by Dr. Sathya Prakash Choudhary, but still unable t=\r\no conclude.\n\n\nI&#39;ve read that people should be very careful while reading Du=\r\nrga Sapthashati, i don&#39;t know to what extent and what could be the conseque=\r\nnces\nI do read Aditya Hrudayam, Srisuktham, Vishnu Sahasranamam, Lalitha Sa=\r\nhasranamam, Lalitha Trishati. I don&#39;t know how i started reading, no body g=\r\nuided me or initiated me how to read but i read it easily, whenever i do pr=\r\nayer i ask for for well being of all the people i know, sometimes just bles=\r\nsings and sometimes i don&#39;t even ask anything.\n\n\nI try to follow reading fo=\r\nr one deity=C2=A0continuously=C2=A0for N number of days, then start reading=\r\n for other deities and follow the same rule.\nAbout me: I&#39;m a bachelor aged =\r\nabout 28\n\nMy questions\n1.

I got the book last year, but i still have=\r\nn&#39;t started reading.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The reason being i&#39;ve come ac=\r\nross all your posts and people responding to your posts, i.e whether a pers=\r\non who has not been initiated could read or should not read. I&#39;m not able t=\r\no conclude, even now i&#39;m reading the post and text by Dr. Sathya Prakash Ch=\r\noudhary, but still unable to conclude.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I&#39;ve=\r\n read that people should be very careful while reading Durga Sapthashati, i=\r\n don&#39;t know to what extent and what could be the consequences&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I do read Aditya Hrudayam, Srisuktham, Vishnu Sahasranama=\r\nm, Lalitha Sahasranamam, Lalitha Trishati. I don&#39;t know how i started readi=\r\nng, no body guided me or initiated me how to read but i read it easily, whe=\r\nnever i do prayer i ask for for well being of all the people i know, someti=\r\nmes just blessings and sometimes i don&#39;t even ask anything.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I try to follow reading for one deity&nbsp;continuously&nbsp;fo=\r\nr N number of days, then start reading for other deities and follow the sam=\r\ne rule.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;About me: I&#39;m a bachelor aged about 28&lt;=\r\n/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My questions&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;1.
