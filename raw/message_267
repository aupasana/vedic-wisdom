Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Kumar ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Vimalananda did not wr=\r\nite the books. He was a yogi who lived his \nlife freely \n&gt; and shunned publ=\r\nicity. Even people close to him did not know about \nhis \n&gt; abilities and ve=\r\nry few knew what he was capable of. He gave a lot \nof \n&gt; freewheeling talks=\r\n to Robert Svoboda on many aspects of \nspirituality and \n&gt; made the latter =\r\ntake down notes. He asked him to publish them after \nhe left \n&gt; the body. T=\r\nhus, the books were published after Vimalananda left the \nworld. \n&gt; He did =\r\nnot want any attention while living.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my humble opinion, these books=\r\n are a divinely inspired work and \n&gt; Vimalananda was someone who experience=\r\nd the highest states of \nconsciousness. \n&gt; He must be a reborn rishi. Howev=\r\ner, I must warn you that these \nbooks may \n&gt; shock some of you and put you =\r\noff.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most religious practices maintain some level of external purity. =\r\n\nEven though \n&gt; we say that &quot;all is Brahman&quot;, we treat different objects \nd=\r\nifferently and \n&gt; consider some objects as &quot;pure&quot; and some as &quot;impure&quot;.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; In aghora, the faith in the internal purity of everything is so \nhigh tha=\r\nt \n&gt; external purity is de-emphasized and seemingly gross and disgusting \nt=\r\nhings \n&gt; are practiced, just so that one overcomes aversion and attraction =\r\n\nfor things \n&gt; and sees all as one (Brahman). The path of aghora is not for=\r\n \neveryone. A \n&gt; very high level of internal purity is required for success=\r\n in it. \nWithout \n&gt; it, one should not attempt it, because one is guarantee=\r\nd to fall.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is no doubt that these are fantastic books that are d=\r\nirectly \ninspired \n&gt; by Mother Smashaana Taaraa. I recommend them to every =\r\nspiritual \nseeker who \n&gt; is curious about tantric practices, with the cauti=\r\nonary word  that \nyou \n&gt; should be prepared to be shocked.\n&gt; \n&gt; Here are th=\r\ne links in Amazon:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) &quot;Aghora, At the Left Hand of God&quot; by Robert E S=\r\nvoboda\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/AGHORA-Left-Hand-God-Aghora/dp/0914732218\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; (2) &quot;Aghora II: Kundalini&quot; by Robert E Svoboda\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/A=\r\nGHORA-II-Kundalini-Aghora/dp/0914732315\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) &quot;Aghora III: The Law of Ka=\r\nrma&quot; by Robert E Svoboda\n&gt; http://www.amazon.com/Aghora-III-Karma-Robert-Sv=\r\noboda/dp/0914732374\n&gt; \n&gt; The first book is awe-inspiring and tends to catch=\r\n the imagination \nwith its \n&gt; magical tales. It is a popular book. The seco=\r\nnd book is even more \ninsightful \n&gt; and full of genuine knowledge. There is=\r\n a lot of nonsense on \nKundalini out \n&gt; there and this is the most genuine =\r\nbook. The third book is the \nleast popular \n&gt; of the series, but perhaps th=\r\ne best. Overall, these books have a \nlot of deep \n&gt; knowledge in coded form=\r\n, provided one overcomes the initial shock \nand gets a \n&gt; sense of what agh=\r\nora is all about.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vimalananda had a darshan of Smashaana Taaraa when h=\r\ne was 20 or 21 \nand kept \n&gt; seeing Her almost every night.

Some people cannot see beyond a \nman&#39;s\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; name and religion and hence cannot recognize when a great \ncelestial\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n being is born in a different religion.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Swami Vimalananda, the Ag=\r\nhori yogi mentioned in the &quot;Aghora&quot; \nseries\n&gt; &gt; books, is somebody who achi=\r\neved the highest states of \nconsciousness.\n&gt; &gt; He received a lot of knowled=\r\nge directly from Mother Tara.\n&gt; &gt; Accordinging to him, Akbar and Jodha were=\r\n the re-incarnation of\n&gt; &gt; Samyukta and Rajput King Prithviraj Chouhan. As =\r\nPrithviraj, he\n&gt; &gt; repelled so many Muslim invaders at the border of India.=\r\n When \nMuslims\n&gt; &gt; finally conquered India, he was reborn as one of them an=\r\nd put \nbreaks\n&gt; &gt; on their aggression and changed their ways.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In =\r\nthat age, Muslim invaders engaged in barbarism, destroyed\n&gt; &gt; temples, libr=\r\naries and other relics of native religion and \nculture.\n&gt; &gt; They beheaded H=\r\nindus who refused to convert, they raped Hindu \nwomen\n&gt; &gt; and they beheaded=\r\n defeated kings. They just tried to wipe out the\n&gt; &gt; native religion and cu=\r\nlture and replace with theirs. Akbar slowed\n&gt; &gt; down the barbarism and aggr=\r\nession and promoted tolerance and\n&gt; &gt; integration. He stopped the forced co=\r\nnversions, rapes and \nbeheadings\n&gt; &gt; of Hindus. He stopped the destruction =\r\nof temples and libraries. He\n&gt; &gt; talked about respecting other religions wh=\r\nile following one&#39;s own\n&gt; &gt; religion. He even took on the mighty Muslim cle=\r\nrics when he \nabolished\n&gt; &gt; a special tax on Hindus based on religion. He w=\r\nas a man of great\n&gt; &gt; character, conviction and principles and was utterly =\r\nfearless. He \nhad\n&gt; &gt; affinity for Rajputs and was even born in a Rajput fa=\r\nmily and \nspent\n&gt; &gt; early years there. He displayed the samskaras and insti=\r\nncts of a\n&gt; &gt; refined and cultured Rajput more than those a of Mughal king =\r\n- he \nwas\n&gt; &gt; so unlike his grandfather Babar, father Humayun and step-brot=\r\nher\n&gt; &gt; Adham.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He used to offer arghyas to Sun in the morning and=\r\n then \nparticipate\n&gt; &gt; in a Zoroastrian fire ritual of Farsis (similar to o=\r\nur homam) and\n&gt; &gt; then do a namaz with Muslim clerics. Such tolerance was u=\r\nnheard of\n&gt; &gt; from any other Muslim ruler in those days (or perhaps even \nt=\r\noday!).\n&gt; &gt; Towards the end of his life, he even started his own religion, =\r\n\nwhich\n&gt; &gt; was based on his realization and is quite noble. He was a \nspiri=\r\ntually\n&gt; &gt; elevated soul. Irrespective of the religion one follows, one \nde=\r\nserves\n&gt; &gt; our respect and admiration if one embodies the spirit of sanatan=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; dharma in one&#39;s thoughts and actions.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Akbar was a true hero=\r\n - a being who came down from a higher loka \nto\n&gt; &gt; fulfil a certain missio=\r\nn with the blessings of rishis. His\n&gt; &gt; contribution to the safekeeping of =\r\nsanatana dharma is not to be\n&gt; &gt; judged from what harm his fellow Muslims i=\r\nnflicted on sanatana\n&gt; &gt; dharma. His contribution is to be judged from what=\r\n *more* harm to\n&gt; &gt; sanatana dharma he helped *avoid*. If he had not come, =\r\nI have no\n&gt; &gt; doubt that sanatana dharma would have suffered much much more=\r\n \nthan it\n&gt; &gt; did. That was not the wish of rishis and that is why they sen=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; somebody to alter the course and minimize the harm. It is \nunfortunat=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; that those who see the goodness of emperor Ashoka and king Shivaji\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; cannot see the goodness of Akbar simply because he was a Muslim.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; It is unfortunate that some Hindus are equating Akbar with the\n&gt; &gt; other =\r\ncruel and barbaric Muslim kings. Who should be (was) a \nfriend\n&gt; &gt; of Hindu=\r\ns is being portrayed as an enemy and being shot down.\n&gt; &gt; Instead, we shoul=\r\nd promote his story and inspire more people to be\n&gt; &gt; like him. He was a gr=\r\neat inspirational figure then and should be \nnow\n&gt; &gt; too.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The epi=\r\nc movie &quot;Jodha Albar&quot; is a very good movie about one of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; greatest a=\r\nnd most dharmik emperors of India. The director and \nactor\n&gt; &gt; did justice =\r\nto a man of great character that Akbar was. I am sad\n&gt; &gt; about the mud-slin=\r\nging that some of my fellow Hindus are engaging \nin.\n&gt; &gt; Please do not assa=\r\nssinate the character of Akbar.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If you want, please make movies o=\r\nf the same caliber and cinematic\n&gt; &gt; excellence on great Hindu heroes such =\r\nas Chatrapati Shivaji,\n&gt; &gt; Prithviraj Chouhan, Sri Krishnadeva Raya, Vikram=\r\narka, Salivahana,\n&gt; &gt; Ashoka, Jnaaneshwar, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Shankarach=\r\narya,\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi etc. But \nt=\r\nhere\n&gt; &gt; is no need to denigrate a fine movie made on Akbar.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thes=\r\ne are my 2 cents on the fire over Jodha Akbar.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------\n-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/h=\r\nomam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyoti=\r\nsh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Ce=\r\nntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n-\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   ----- Original Me=\r\nssage ----- \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Namaskar\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   This is an awareness drive to=\r\n awake people to boycott\n&gt; &gt; movie &#39;Jodhaa Akbar&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   The movie Jo=\r\ndhaa Akbar is a vile, vicious, and covert attempt \nby\n&gt; &gt; a mischievous pro=\r\nducer/director from Bollywood (Mumbai) to make \nquick\n&gt; &gt; bucks by denigrat=\r\ning and vilifying the Hindu (Rajput) people. \nSonia&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; (Antonia Maino) C=\r\nongress government promtly banned &#39;Da Vinci Code&#39;\n&gt; &gt; movie after Christian=\r\ns&#39; protest, but this Secular (?) government \nis\n&gt; &gt; so insensitive about Hi=\r\nndus protest about &#39;Jodhaa-Akbar&#39; !\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Visit - http://www.hindujag=\r\nruti.org/news/3815.html to -\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;     a..
