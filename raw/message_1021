I can underst=\r\nand this with regard to action/reaction philosophy \nbut with regard to free=\r\n will, how do we interpret the above \nstatement? e.g., murdering innocent p=\r\neople is an action done by \none&#39;s free will (agami karma) How to understand=\r\n this &quot;murder&quot; \nincident with the &quot;Will of God&quot;. \n\n2. How to understand/int=\r\nerpret the &quot;will of God&quot; in a natural \ncatastrophe kind of situation ? (E.g=\r\n., Tsumani disaster or \nEarthQuake disaster, leading to mass deaths of hund=\r\nreds of lives?)\n\nThanks & Regards, \n--Murahari\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; \n&lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Madam,\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n It took a while to get to your mail. I am cc&#39;ing the reply to some \nyahoog=\r\nroups interested in spirituality, while ensuring your \nanonymity.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A l=\r\not of philosophical questions can be answered in multiple ways. \nThere is n=\r\no single correct answer. The answer appropriate for one \nperson is inapprop=\r\nriate for another. If I say &quot;God is the doer of \nall things. When Arjuna ki=\r\nlled his gurus and elders, actually God \ndid it through him&quot;, a lesser pers=\r\non may imitate it and that will be \nunfortunate. But that will be a very ap=\r\npropriate point to make to a \nmore elevated person who still has a sense of=\r\n ownership over his \nactions and need to give it up.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thus, one cannot=\r\n answer questions such as yours without \nunderstanding the current spiritua=\r\nl level of the asking person. \nOtherwise the answer will be utterly useless=\r\n. I will go by my gut \nand answer the way I think will be useful to you and=\r\n some others on \nthe vedic-wisdom yahoogroup.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; 1. God created human beings and other beings so that there is some \ncomm=\r\notion in the Atman (cosmic soul). If there is no different \nbeings with dif=\r\nferent qualities, the whole universe will be filled \nwith Atman (cosmic sou=\r\nl). That too happens for a while. But, at \nother times, various beings with=\r\n various qualities are created. An \nocean may be still for a while and give=\r\n rise to a lot of waves for a \nwhile. If cosmic soul is like an ocean, vari=\r\nous beings are like \nwaves in the ocean.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. God decides based on the =\r\ncumulative good/bad of all your \nprevious actions and wishes over all your =\r\nlives so far. If you have \ngood tendencies, it is because of good actions a=\r\nnd wishes in the \npast. If you have bad tendencies, it is because of bad ac=\r\ntions and \nwishes in the past. All you can do is to engage in good actions =\r\nand \nhave good wishes. That will keep you in good stead in future.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 3.=\r\n Your own free will!!!! That is why now you have to pay for it. \nNature wor=\r\nks on the principle of &quot;equal reaction to every action&quot;. \nYou engaged in an=\r\n action using your own free will and nature has to \nsomehow find a way to g=\r\nive the equal reaction to that action. God is \nthere to implement the rules=\r\n of nature.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The circumstances faced by you are decides by nature base=\r\nd on the \nprevious actions exerted by your free will. Within the limitation=\r\ns \nimposed by those circumstances, your free will decides one \nparticular a=\r\nction among several possible actions. That gets added to \nthe list of your =\r\nactions and nature pays back for it in future by \ncreating different circum=\r\nstances for you to operate under.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 4. There is a duality and singulari=\r\nty. In the world of \nsingularity, there is one god - the cosmic being. Gods=\r\n and demons, \ngood and bad, auspiciousness and inauspiciousness, intelligen=\r\nce and \nfoolishness, happiness and sadness, knowledge and ignorance, punya =\r\n\nand sin - all are nothing but this singular god. There is nothing \nbut tha=\r\nt singular god. That singular god lives in all of us, in each \nmolecule, at=\r\nom and sub-atomic particle of this universe. The entire \ncore of our being =\r\nis filled with this singular god.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When the same world is seen through=\r\n the lense of duality, this \nsingular god manifests as different entities. =\r\nIn the world of \nduality, there are various gods engaged in various good ro=\r\nles and \nvarious demons engaged in various bad roles. There is always a \ntu=\r\nssle between them.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Now again, all these gods and demons engaged in va=\r\nrious good and \nbad roles exist within us in a microcosmic form. The Brihas=\r\npati \n(teacher of gods) within us (i.e. our intelligence and discretion) \nt=\r\nells the gods within us (various good qualities) what to do and \nworks for =\r\ntheir victory. Various gods and demons discharge their \nroles. But the resu=\r\nlt varies.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If a person&#39;s spiritual evolution is like that of the worl=\r\nd when \nRavana was ruling earth, then the demons inside the person will be =\r\n\ndominating over the gods and gods go into hiding within that person. \nHe w=\r\nill engage in sins. If a person&#39;s spiritual evolution is like \nthat of the =\r\nworld when Rama killed Ravana and ruled earth in peace \nand prosperity, the=\r\nn the gods inside that person will be dominating \nover the demons. Ge will =\r\nengage in good deeds. And so on.\n&gt;  \n&gt; So, realize that there are gods and =\r\ndemons inside us and there is \na constant tussle between them. The good thi=\r\nng is that gods are \namara, i.e. immortal. They can be weak and defeated, b=\r\nut they never \ncompletely die. Demons can die, gods can never die. They may=\r\n be \ndefeated, but they live on and overcome demons oneday!\n&gt;  \n&gt; If someon=\r\ne tells you &quot;there is only one god and he is in all of \nus&quot;, realize that t=\r\nhis refers to the singular god I described \nearlier. With that god, there i=\r\ns no distinction between good and \nbad. The distinction comes with gods of =\r\nduality. The moment you talk \nof duality, gods and demons are both there an=\r\nd there is a tussle.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 5. God is simply doing his job. Nature is based =\r\non the rule of \nequal reaction to one&#39;s actions and God impassionately impl=\r\nements \nthat rule. If one was really cruel to somebody else and killed \ncru=\r\nelly, nature will have to find a way to give an equal reaction. \nIt is sad,=\r\n but that is how nature works!\n&gt;  \n&gt; 6. The previous karmas and rinas to va=\r\nrious people decide the give \nand take in this life. The relations in this =\r\nlife may be relations \nin the past life too (but the exact relationship may=\r\n be different). \nIf you harassed a particular person in the last life, natu=\r\nre may \nprovide an opportunity for that person to harass you now.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Aga=\r\nin, if nature is placing you in a difficult circumstance where \nsomeone is =\r\nharassing you and making life difficult, it is not \nbecause nature hates yo=\r\nu or god hates you. It is because you did \nexactly the same thing to someon=\r\ne else previously. Nature is paying \nback.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The goal of this &quot;pay back=\r\n game&quot; of nature is that after a big \ncycle of actions and equal reactions,=\r\n one understands how nature \nworks and manages to leave the game! When all =\r\nthe players leave the \ngame, the game will end. Until then, the game will g=\r\no on...\n&gt;  \n&gt; 7. As more and more people engage in more and more sinful \nbe=\r\nhavior, this creates of a spiral of adharma. That increases the \nnegative q=\r\nuality of time in general and leads to more and more \npeople engaging in ad=\r\nharma. It is a spiral.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Unfortunately, we are in Kali yuga and adharma=\r\n will only increase \nin the long run. But, by engaging in good actions of g=\r\nreat \nmagnitude, we can create positive energy and slow down this spiral \no=\r\nf adharma.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is good that you worry about =\r\nthose who suffer. That compassion \nis great. But that compassion alone is n=\r\not sufficient. Instead, if \nyou and others engage in good actions and creat=\r\ne a positive energy \nof great magnitude in the world, that can be helpful. =\r\nIf ten \nthousand people are performing a homam every morning, trying to \ntr=\r\nansform their attitude to that of surrender to god and limited \nego, that c=\r\nan really transform the world atleast for a few decades \nand centuries.\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; Do homam, do meditation, read good books, have good company, \ndiscuss sp=\r\niritual matters (instead of wasting time on meaningless \nentertainment), th=\r\nink of god, try to understand the ways of god, \nlessen pride and ego, try t=\r\no do your best in each action without \nmuch attachment, analyze each of you=\r\nr own actions and correct the \ninternal attitude. If you keep up like this =\r\nand several others do, \nthe problems you mentioned can see some relief.\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/=\r\ntarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free J=\r\nyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC=\r\n) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt;   Dear sir,\n&gt; \n&gt;   This is &lt;deleted&gt;=\r\n from &lt;deleted&gt;. I came to know about you from \nmy husband &lt;deleted&gt;.\n&gt;   H=\r\ne has told about you a lot and i have read your \nmails ..ganapathi homam, \n=\r\n&gt;   vedic explanations etc.,\n&gt; \n&gt;   I wish you will help me to have clear i=\r\ndeas about some of my \nbasic questions.\n&gt;   Always I ask some questions to =\r\nmyself.Even myself and my husband \nwill discuss\n&gt;   regarding this. But we =\r\nboth unable to find out the answer. They \nare,\n&gt; \n&gt;   1. My first question =\r\nis why God created human beings?\n&gt; \n&gt;   2. When God is creating all the hum=\r\nan beings,we are all God&#39;s \nchildren.\n&gt;   Then why he is differntiating som=\r\ne people are good, some are \nbad? On what basis he\n&gt;   is deciding that &quot;th=\r\nis person will have good habits in his life \ntime and that person will have=\r\n\n&gt;   all bad habits? &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   3.Some of the astrologers say to me, whatever=\r\n \nproblems/sufferings etc., we are facing in\n&gt;   this life time is due to o=\r\nur previous karma.ie.,we have done \nsome sin to others in our \n&gt;   previous=\r\n birth.Who induced us to do sin in our previous birth to \nothers?\n&gt; \n&gt;   4.=\r\n Some people say, God is inside us. When God is inside us, why \npeople are =\r\ndoing sin to \n&gt;   others? If they are doing, why God is not correcting them=\r\n??\n&gt; \n&gt;   5.Nowadays, they are so many accidents happening in the city. \nPa=\r\ninful deaths are\n&gt;   happening which cannot be digested / make us sleepless=\r\n for \nnights together. Why God \n&gt;   is giving these type of painful death t=\r\no people? why he is so \ncruel?People say the person \n&gt;   who died might hav=\r\ne made sin to others in last birth. For that, \nthis kind of cruelty is requ=\r\nired?\n&gt;   Why God is not giving peaceful death??\n&gt; \n&gt;   6. My another quest=\r\nion is regarding family issues. Most of the \ndaughter-in-law suffer becos\n&gt;=\r\n   of her Mother-in-law/Father-in-law/Sister-in-law and Husbands or \nvice v=\r\nersa. I have come across\n&gt;   so many families like this.If daughter in law =\r\nis tortured from \nher husband&#39;s family, is it due\n&gt;   to her horoscope or d=\r\nue to society. If it is due to her \nhoroscope, its the same answer that \n&gt; =\r\n  its her karma. Why her karma is written like that? why she \nshould suffer=\r\n in her life?? Who has\n&gt;   made her to suffer like this(even if she is of g=\r\nood \ncharacter/good habits)??\n&gt; \n&gt;   7. Nowadays, it is becoming very unsaf=\r\ne for ladies in the \nsociety. Some girls are getting \n&gt;   exploited and som=\r\ne knowingly going in the wrong way making a \nmind set that nothing is \n&gt;   =\r\nwrong. Why society has developed like this??When God has created \nthe world=\r\n, why he is \n&gt;   allowing it to go worse? What will be the future of the \ny=\r\noungsters? whether we can bring \n&gt;   up our children with good habits? I fe=\r\nel its very difficult..All \nthese things related to astrology?\n&gt; \n&gt;   Kindl=\r\ny bear with my long mail and guide me.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thanks/Regards,\n&gt;   &lt;deleted&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
