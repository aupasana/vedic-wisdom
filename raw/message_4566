I tried to do self introspection but have bee=\r\nn unable to get an answer.\nLet me give you an incident to serve as a starti=\r\nng point.\n\nI was driving my car through a congested lane in Pune during one=\r\n of my trips to the local market and a rickshaw driver suddenly took a wron=\r\ng turn and we almost collided. Now I just ignored the incident but this dri=\r\nver stopped the vehicle at a traffic junction and got into a verbal duel wi=\r\nth me and not to be held back I too responded and was almost ready to excha=\r\nnge physical blows with him. But we later went our ways once the traffic si=\r\ngnal turned green.\n\nAfter this incident I remained angry till late evening.=\r\n Thinking of the incident and replaying the events again and again in my mi=\r\nnd and also imagining giving a few punches on the rickshaw drivers face :) =\r\n:).\n\nWhen I did introspection of the incident a few days later with a calm =\r\nmind , I questioned the need for me to become angry ? What a waster of time=\r\n and energy has this been?\nWhy did &quot;I&quot; get angry when the driver abused me =\r\nverbally ??\nWhy should &quot;I&quot; get offended by anything that any one says to &quot;m=\r\ne&quot;?\nHas the driver really offended the real &quot;ME&quot;?\n\nIf NOT then what is that=\r\n which makes me or any other human being angry??\nI was reminded of Shankara=\r\n&#39;s Manishaa Panchakam and his encounter with a chandala in KAshi.\nThe chand=\r\nala asked shankara \n&quot;O great ascetic! Tell me . Do you want me to keep a di=\r\nstance from you, by uttering &#39;go away&#39; &#39;go away&#39; taking me to be an outcast=\r\ne ?\nIs it addressed from one body made of food to another body made of food=\r\n,or is it consciousness from consciousness | which, O, the\nbest among ascet=\r\nics, you wish should go away, by saying\n&quot;Go away, go away&quot;? Do tell me.&quot;\n\nW=\r\nhat can we do to remove this self identification that every person has with=\r\n his mortal body?\nI think this self identification is the root cause which =\r\nprevents a person from moving ahead.\nPlease tell me how I can dissolve this=\r\n &quot;Self&quot; so that I no longer identify with it?\nI know sadhana is the key and=\r\n I have been doing it . But the shackles are strong. The Ego of &quot;I&quot; has to =\r\ndie for us to move ahead. But how??\n\nRegards,\nGirish Sundaram\n\n\n"}}
