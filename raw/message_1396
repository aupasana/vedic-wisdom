How can i a=\r\ngain experience the Beloved.\n            That then is the experience of man=\r\ntra when it is done correctly.\n            When the sadhak&#39;s personality is=\r\n effaced such that the deity&#39;s personality sits there then the sadhak exper=\r\niences himself as that Deity(Devata).\n            There then arises no diff=\r\nerence in the sadhak or the deity commanding a certain thing to happen( be =\r\nit what appears to be good or be it that which appears to be bad) . The dei=\r\nty&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra devatas make the person care almost for n=\r\nothing himself, so self identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spirit=\r\nual evolution continues.\n            Remember, there is very little accordi=\r\nng to me which is black magic. It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti an=\r\nd deity is a higher shakti such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinn=\r\namasta, then your power will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijn=\r\nana). After the death of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the de=\r\nity or if he was originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reser=\r\nved for these beings. \n            Attacking such a sadhak brings the full =\r\nbearing of karma onto the heads of the attackers and some people may realis=\r\ne this to their detriment( Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city=\r\n of Patan with his Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equa=\r\nte this with black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like =\r\nyou attack a normal person, and you will get a result of this from that sam=\r\ne Atma whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack som=\r\nebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few karmas left, th=\r\nen the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is not on the sadha=\r\nka, but on his identification, ie God or the universe).\n            If peop=\r\nle persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then the=\r\nre is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover then their minds and=\r\n intellects will not be free of identification with the body and so their a=\r\nctions are those which are generally termed as black magic. These people us=\r\nually join the same spirits which they have been using after death, this is=\r\n not an enjoyable experience.\n            Imagine if somebody is worshippin=\r\ng Chandika for a few lifetimes, then even in this birth he or she is drawn =\r\nto that deity and such a sadhak may acheive after a few repitions of a mant=\r\nra(because of his previous effort).\n            On the other hand somebody =\r\ndoing this mantra only in this lifetime may feel that the 64 things which b=\r\nind every mantra are crucial and may not acheive in this lifetime.\n        =\r\n    According to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me su=\r\nggest an easy sadhana.\n            If one is so inclined, then starting on =\r\nsome good day, do 1000 reititions of the Savitri(some call this the Gayatri=\r\n, but the real Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\n            S=\r\name time every day.\n            Same place.\n            Same materials.\n   =\r\n         Same direction.\n            As little movement as one can.\n       =\r\n     Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n            Comple=\r\nte restraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the body), reduce =\r\nfood intake, grow a beard.\n            Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, m=\r\nake sure your bowels are empty before you start.\n            Continue this =\r\nfor 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n            See the diffe=\r\nrence in your personality before and after.\n            Long and short , wh=\r\nat is important is that life may be short, so do some sadhana, and persist =\r\nwith that sadhana for as long as is physically possible.\n            I hope=\r\n this clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n\n         =\r\n   Kind Love and Regards\n            manish\n            You may post this o=\r\nn the list as a clarification from me if you feel that this is suitable.\n\n =\r\n           On Sun, Mar 1, 2009 at 10:12 PM, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao &lt;pvr@chart=\r\ner.net&gt; wrote:\n\n              Dear Sanjay,\n\n              &gt; Mantra Shastra =\r\nis a very detailed work and includes mantra dosha etc.\n              &gt; It i=\r\ns very scientific and accurate. It takes a lifetime to master this. \n\n     =\r\n         Some may be fascinated by the texture, color and volume of the cha=\r\nff and miss the grain.\n\n              Most people who talk about mantra sha=\r\nstra focus on the chaff and not on the grain.\n\n              &gt; You talk of =\r\nbegging God vs commanding God? Now where did that come from?\n              =\r\n&gt; How is it related to what is under discussion. Perhaps I have missed many=\r\n\n              &gt; mails and am not able to get the context. Trying to comman=\r\nd God is\n              &gt; *BLACK MAGIC* and this is detestable to say the le=\r\nast. The attitude should\n              &gt; always be that of a beggar in fron=\r\nt of God. If anyone has said otherwise, I\n              &gt; also disagee with=\r\n him/her.\n\n              I mentioned the above with respect to the need of =\r\nthousands of mantras and technicalities. If one does not want to command go=\r\nd and wants to be a beggar who will take whatever is given, there is no nee=\r\nd for thousands of mantras and all the umpteen technicalities. These thousa=\r\nnds of mantras and umpteen technicalities are for commanding thousands of d=\r\nifferent results from god. That is why I talked of commanding vs begging. H=\r\nowever, this commanding works slightly differently than one may imagine. I =\r\nwill elaborate.\n\n              Also, commanding god is NOT black magic. Com=\r\nmanding low level beings is black magic, which can be accomplished even by =\r\na person not quite elevated spiritually and suffering from a heavy ego. How=\r\never, commanding higher beings such as gods is possible only for a spiritua=\r\nlly elevated person with no or extremely small ego. This commanding that I =\r\nam referring to is not an egoistic achievement. In fact, an egoist cannot a=\r\nchieve it. Only a person succeeding in completely effacing individual ego c=\r\nan achieve this commanding! I will repeat something from the previous mail =\r\nto clarify:\n\n              The universe has many lokas (planes of conscious=\r\nness), many beings and many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions=\r\n possible between them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. W=\r\nhen one is able to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (=\r\ni.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then=\r\n one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in t=\r\nhe mantra then causes internal changes by the flow of energy internally in =\r\nspecific ways (specific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding extern=\r\nal changes in the universe and corresponding karmic interactions between va=\r\nrious objects.\n\n              Each set of &quot;karmic interactions between vari=\r\nous objects&quot; is a &quot;result&quot;. Various mantras are for various &quot;results&quot;. One =\r\nmay term merging self-awareness in a mantra fully and getting a specific re=\r\nsult from it as &quot;commanding a result&quot; from god. Whether you like the term o=\r\nr not, it is essentially that.\n\n              *        *        *\n\n        =\r\n      But the bottomline is this: Only a highly purified sadhaka of very lo=\r\nw ego can command specific results from god (not for selfishness or even eg=\r\no satisfaction, but acting as an unattached instrument of Nature fulfilling=\r\n one&#39;s dharma set by Nature). Various mantras and technicalities of mantra =\r\nshastra taught by rishis are meant for such sadhakas.\n\n              Those =\r\nare hardly of use to so many people out there with dense egos seeking speci=\r\nfic selfish results. They cannot command specific results from god (because=\r\n of their heavy attachment to the result, which is in turn due to their own=\r\n attachment to a limited ego), even if they use all the techniques of mantr=\r\na shastra and all the associated rules of astrology. Instead of wasting the=\r\nir time with these technicalities, they will be better off learning to be g=\r\nood beggars at God&#39;s door.\n\n              Just pick any prasiddha mantra or=\r\n a mantra you feel attracted to, without worrying about so many technicalit=\r\nies, and learn to be humble and surrender to the Lord. Patiently wait for h=\r\nim to give you what you want. Like a beggar, take whatever and whenever he =\r\ngives.\n\n              Keep praying every day or every second when you are a=\r\nble to. Even when you are not praying, remember him in all of your actions.=\r\n When you enjoy something in the material world, tell yourself that it is h=\r\nis and that he gave it to you. If you remember him all the time, slowly the=\r\n dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. This fixing of attitude is fa=\r\naaaaaaaaaaar more important than picking the right mantra, right weekday, r=\r\night tithi etc (that too based on unreliable knowledge coming from question=\r\nable sources!).\n\n              *        *        *\n\n              There may=\r\n be a mountain with thousands of paths (mantra) for climbing it. Each path =\r\nmay lead to a different spot (different experience) on the top and show a d=\r\nifferent scenery (result). Expert advisors (astrologers) may tell you to us=\r\ne a specific path (mantra) to see a specific scenery (result). But such adv=\r\nice is useless to a handicapped person without legs (a selfish person with =\r\ndense ego). It is relevant only to person with legs and one who is strong a=\r\nnd sturdy, who can successfully climb the mountain (a reasonably detached p=\r\nerson with very little ego).\n\n              Even when you encounter a perso=\r\nn who has legs and can actually climb the mountain, the stress should be on=\r\n how to climb the mountain and traverse the long path, rather than which pa=\r\nth to take. The astrologers who are bogged down by all the technicalities a=\r\nnd people who take customized mantra advice from astrologers and think that=\r\n they will get a result quickly by doing that &#39;powerful&#39; mantra are missing=\r\n the basic point. The power of a powerful mantra is with respect to the exp=\r\nerience and result obtained *after* one succeeds with the mantra. A partcic=\r\nularly powerful mantra is akin to a path leading to a point atop the mounta=\r\nin where the view shows a particularly beautiful scenery. But the bottomlin=\r\ne is that you do have to survive the climb along the long path.\n\n          =\r\n    We need to emphasize the attitude and approach needed for the long clim=\r\nb, rather than emphasizing the choice of the path based on horoscope. It is=\r\n worth noting that so many great spiritual teachers who came in the last ce=\r\nntury or two did not emphasize picking the right mantra based on horoscope =\r\netc. Instead, they emphasized having the correct attitude - surrender, subm=\r\nission, devotion, patience, persistence, discipline, humility etc!!!! *That=\r\n* is a lot more important and useful than trying to be oversmart with the c=\r\nhoice of mantra, day etc and impress god.\n\n              *        *        =\r\n*\n\n              &gt; when should the worship of a graha be done? Let us say s=\r\nomeone\n              &gt; wishes to worship Mars (Mangala graha). When do you =\r\nthink this\n              &gt; worship should be done?\n               \n        =\r\n      You can do anyday. Parasara does not mention any day for doing homam =\r\nto a graha.\n\n              In fact, if one wants, one can do a homam or wor=\r\nship to Mars (or any planet) every day. It is even better that way.\n\n      =\r\n        If an astrologer suggests doing it on a Tuesday, it is fine. But sa=\r\nying that doing it on so and so day will bring serious dangers because Mars=\r\n is an enemy of so and so planet would be stretching things.\n\n             =\r\n &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna dvaipaayana) got h=\r\nis\n              &gt; knowledge and those who wrote it as scribes for him, whe=\r\nre did they get it from?\n               \n              From Self - from wit=\r\nhin.

One can then call Venus, a water=\r\ny planet, being in a fiery sign or Mars, a fiery planet, being in a watery =\r\nsign as gandanta. Gandanta requires a *transition* in a contiguous space.\n\n=\r\n              In your example of upapada lord&#39;s tithi, there is no contiguo=\r\nus space where there is a water-fire transition.\n\n              &gt; Now somew=\r\nhere you talked of wasting time!!!

What is the reason for Gandanta being in 0=\r\n deg, 120 deg and 240 deg of the zodiac if it is not a junction between agn=\r\ni and jala...I want to her your words if you have any. You keep saying Para=\r\nsara says so and yet there is nothing forthcoming.\n              &gt; \n       =\r\n       &gt; The rashi is associated with the Aditya as the rashi come into exi=\r\nstence because of the Sun, which is the agni tattva. Vara is also agni tatt=\r\nva among the panchanga of Jyotisha. That is why Vaara is related to rashi. =\r\nKarma has been advised in the vaara of the lords of the rashi or the hora o=\r\nf the lords of the rashi related to a bhaava and for this reason, fasting a=\r\nnd other such karma related to rashi are also based on this. [See Prashna M=\r\narga for details].\n              &gt; \n              &gt; Moon is the significato=\r\nr of the Aroodha. It is the *emotional content* related to the maya manifes=\r\ntation of everything in life. Suffering is caused as we do not fathom the k=\r\narma associated that resulted in suffering and fasting is a a means of self=\r\n punishment and correction related to the raashi where the aroodha is. Just=\r\n as Agni has the purity to burn the root of sin, fasting on vaara related t=\r\no the UL is surely going to cleanse the sins associated with the suffering =\r\nin it. While this may not give a 100% satisfaction as the *moon* content ha=\r\ns not been addressed, at least the initiation of the aroodha occurs and peo=\r\nple find their partners, get married and get along with life. Proof lies in=\r\n the pudding and with so many cases where people have fasted on UL days and=\r\n have got result, we have found faith in these teachings reinforced. Why fa=\r\nst? Fasting on vaara is a means to correcting the flaw associated with the =\r\nraashi. Raashi is a quantity and hence it is related to the material effect=\r\ns of the bhava and that is what people are looking for when they come to th=\r\n astrologer. You have done well to recall my teachings in this =C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC=E2=80=9C remember what I taught =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C Men should wor=\r\nship a female deity and women shold worship a male deity for the UL fasting=\r\n. I wonder if they really follow this.\n              &gt; \n              &gt; Why=\r\n not give fasting at night instead of day? Sun is always good for the Upapa=\r\nda (Jaimini etc) and that is why we have limited this to day fasting and no=\r\nt night fasting as well or 24 hour fast. This is my interpolation. [ satisf=\r\nied J ] Elders would have given long periods of fast starting from the vaar=\r\na, like keeping 21 days fast for the birth of child! You think I should be =\r\ndoing that! You think anyone will lsiten. Try it yourself before asking me =\r\nto advise those hard penance kind of fasts.\n              &gt; \n              =\r\n&gt; Who says the Moon has nothing to do with the arudha. It is the sustainer.=\r\n Now people to an astrologer when they are looking for getting married and =\r\nhardly anyone comes these days asking for prolonging marriage. Either they =\r\nwant to get into one or get out of one and into another...astrologers these=\r\n days are relegated to helping people make these transitions painless and f=\r\nast. Of course some have come and I have not failed them.

I find these principles illogical and bas=\r\ned on hasty thinking. There may be a little difference between doing an aus=\r\nterity on different days, but my point is that it is smaller compared to th=\r\ne difference between doing and not doing at all and that doing it on a &quot;wro=\r\nng day&quot; does not cause danger as being suggested.\n              &gt; \n        =\r\n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I am sorry.

For worshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekda=\r\ny or nakshatra is better than others. This is based on the deity and irresp=\r\nective of the person worshipping. Let me give an analogy.

J\n              &gt; \n              &gt; Choosing the day of=\r\n a remedy based on the deity is more important and the variations based on =\r\nindividual horoscope are less important. I am not saying there are no horos=\r\ncopic variations. But they are smaller and, more importantly, I question if=\r\n they are actually well-understood by astrologers today to apply *reliably*=\r\n.

OR it is like sayi=\r\nng that we can\n              &gt; take paracetamol and pray that cancer is cur=\r\ned. I think I may have to\n              &gt; write a book on Mantra Shastra to=\r\n validate the teachings of the vedic\n              &gt; seers.\n\n              =\r\nI did not say it is &quot;useless&quot;. Instead, I suggest that our ability to use i=\r\nt is limited and we should take our limitations into consideration.\n\n      =\r\n        The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings =\r\nand many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between t=\r\nhem. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to =\r\nperfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts bu=\r\nt the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences th=\r\ne mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then caus=\r\nes internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (spec=\r\nific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the u=\r\nniverse and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.\n\n   =\r\n           However, this variety of mantras, experiences and results is irr=\r\nelevant to one who does not have such perfect control over the mind to abso=\r\nrb the mind fully in a mantra. It is relevant only to a seer whose self-awa=\r\nreness is quite evolved and hence control over mind impeccable. Such seers =\r\nare extremely extremely rare today. Most people are unable to experience an=\r\ny mantra and mantras do not work for them as they are supposed to.\n\n       =\r\n       *        *        *\n\n              Just repeating a combination of s=\r\nounds does not guarantee anything. Some people may think that certain resul=\r\nts come when they repeat a mantra certain number of times. That is an incor=\r\nrect notion. A mantra may work for one person quickly and another may spend=\r\n the whole life chanting it and nothing may happen. Absorption of the entir=\r\ne mind into a mantra is needed for a mantra to really work and it is much m=\r\nore difficult than one may think.\n\n              *        *        *\n\n     =\r\n         A highly learned scholar in the court of a king may be able to com=\r\nmand the king and get whatever he wants from king. An incapable one is bett=\r\ner off begging the king, rather than trying to command (and failing for sur=\r\ne).\n\n              Similarly, most people are better off begging god for wh=\r\nat they want rather than trying to use the right mantra to command what the=\r\ny want. A beggar does not need a huge vocabulary or great scholarship or kn=\r\nowledge. Feeling of humility and helplessness, surrender, patience and pers=\r\nistence are what help a beggar succeed. A beggar needs the right attitude r=\r\nather than knowledge. In this age and time, best bet for most people is to =\r\nlearn to be a good beggar at god&#39;s door.\n\n              What people today n=\r\need for material and spiritual progress through remedial measures is a bett=\r\ner attitude in begging god rather than a better choice of tools such as man=\r\ntras and other specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to command a specific r=\r\nesult from god.\n\n              It is worth noting that so many great spirit=\r\nual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking =\r\nthe right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having th=\r\ne correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence=\r\n, discipline, humility etc. *That* is a lot more important and useful than =\r\ntrying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.\n=\r\n\n              *        *        *\n\n              One more thing. We have m=\r\nany mantras given by rishis, but the guidelines from rishis like Parasara o=\r\nn how to pick a mantra based on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers=\r\n today do not operate solely based on them. They use all kinds of other rul=\r\nes coming from various traditions. They are not free from corruption and im=\r\nperfection. Most scriptures associate various mantras with various results,=\r\n irrespective of horoscope. For example, irrespective of who is the 6th lor=\r\nd and 8th lord and lord of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is goo=\r\nd for debt control. And so on. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today&#39;=\r\ns astrologers, way beyond the scope of Parasara&#39;s guidelines.\n\n            =\r\n  If one has a sadguru, I recommend following the word of sadguru rather th=\r\nan that of an astrology theoretician.\n\n              If not, there is no fo=\r\nolproof way to know the right path. Pick any path (given by an astrologer o=\r\nr one that you feel attracted to) instead of wasting time and then keep wor=\r\nking on your attitude. The latter is the key. As I said earlier, learn to b=\r\ne a humble beggar at god&#39;s door. Choice of Mantra is secondary and attitude=\r\n is primary. If you succeed in being a really humble beggar, you stand a be=\r\ntter chance of success than great scholars.\n\n              Any prasiddha ma=\r\nntra (e.g. ashtakshari, panchakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sah=\r\nasranaam, rudram, hare krishna maha mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva se=\r\nersham, mrityunjaya mantra etc) can help one make progress if one develops =\r\nthe right attitude. Without the right attitude, even an impeaccably picked =\r\nmantra will do nothing.\n\n              *        *        *\n\n              I=\r\n hope this sufficiently clarifies my stand. I discuss these matters related=\r\n to spiritual sadhana more on the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup.

Which is perfectly i=\r\nn line with everything I have learnt.\n\n                Two statements you h=\r\nave made contradict standard texts on Jyotish and Mantra Shastra. Please co=\r\nrrect me if I am not understanding you well out here -\n\n                1. =\r\nStatement 1: *fasting on any day or any tithi* is good so long as the sanka=\r\nlpa has been made for the devata you intend to pray to. Results maybe a bit=\r\n delayed but will be there.\n                2. Statement 2: *reciting any p=\r\nrayer* will give the desired effects for any ailment we wish to remedy\n\n   =\r\n             Is this what you intended to say or did I get this wrong?\n\n   =\r\n             Statement 1 is an arrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra i=\r\ns bogus and has no relevance as the remedial measures prescribed by Parasar=\r\na and others to be done on specific days are irrlevant and not of much cons=\r\nequence. This sounds like another astrologer I had known some time back who=\r\nse statements like this coerced me to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so =\r\nthat people are not misled but such pretexts to knowledge.\n\n               =\r\n Statement 2 is an arrogance that the entire mantra shastra is useless and =\r\nthe Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mant=\r\nras for the same devata, like say thousands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuma=\r\nn when any one mantra would suffice. OR it is like saying that we can take =\r\nparacetamol and pray that cancer is cured. I think I may have to write a bo=\r\nok on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings of the vedic seers.\n\n       =\r\n         I think there is something wrong in the way you are saying what yo=\r\nu want to say.

The basic point is that Upapada is a rashi and carries energy\n          =\r\n      &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the day ruled by tithi of the 2=\r\nnd\n                &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala energy to vara, a=\r\nnd gandanta may\n                &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come into a da=\r\nnger. So, what is the way out.\n                &gt; \n                &gt; Why doe=\r\ns a rashi carry the energy of vaara only and not that of the tithi???? Why =\r\ndoes rashi represent vaara or fire?\n                &gt; \n                &gt; [S=\r\nanjay Rath:] Because Raashi were created by Surya and for doing so Surya to=\r\nok 12 forms called the Dvadasa Aditya...Narasimha you ask this?? What is ha=\r\nppening?\n                &gt; \n                &gt; After all, Rudra rules over t=\r\nhe element of fire and Gouri rules over the element of water and one worshi=\r\nps Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus (water) is the karaka for=\r\n marriage. So one could even say that UL/marriage is represented by water e=\r\nlement and fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the element of water (prosperi=\r\nty and well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could even say that fasting =\r\non the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as it brings the fire elemen=\r\nt represented by weekday to the water of UL and causes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n        =\r\n        &gt; \n                &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the Maya and is associate=\r\nd with the Raashi Narasimha. It is the 12L which is the creator of the UL..=\r\n.just as the mother Gouri creates everything through the shakti of the grah=\r\na, all the arudha are created by her due to the lordships of the planets. S=\r\no fasting on the tithi lorded by the 12th lord will be a *more correct* ans=\r\nwer.\n                &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n                [Narasimha] W=\r\ne always say that houses (truth) are represented by Sun (aatman) and arudha=\r\n padas (maya) by Moon (mind).\n\n                Thus, 12th house is the actu=\r\nal creator and UL is the apparent creator in the field of maya. Houses (tru=\r\nth) should actually be associated with Sun (aatman) and Shiva (and not Gour=\r\ni), while arudha padas (perception) should actually be associated with Moon=\r\n (mind) and Gouri. After all, that is what we do in the tripod method in da=\r\nsa judgment.\n\n                Thus, it is actually more logical to say that=\r\n 12th house and 12th lord imbibe the agni tattva of Sun and UL and UL lord =\r\nimbibe the jala tattva of Moon.\n\n                Is the above &quot;*more correc=\r\nt* answer&quot; based on your own thinking or is it from a classic or from tradi=\r\ntion?\n\n                &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n              &gt; The mantr=\r\na one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fasting is far more effective th=\r\nan at other times. The conservation of energy otherwise spent on digestion =\r\nor speech will enable far more effective mantra meditation. So fast or keep=\r\n mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to maximize the effect of the mantr=\r\na.\n              &gt; \n              &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with this=\r\n. Correct eating is the best blessing for good mantra practise. On days whe=\r\nn one fasts the mind is troubled by hunger causing the stomach to burn and =\r\nchurn and this disturbs mantra japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is many =\r\nmany times better than complete fasting.\n\n              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n              [Narasimha] Well, if one cannot fast, then one is desti=\r\nned to expend some energy on digestion after all and not focus all energy o=\r\nn the mantra. But the bottomline is that shastras say that one should medit=\r\nate either without or with very little food (niraahaaro mitaahaaro). In any=\r\n case, I hope we agree that meditation sessions after heavy eating are heav=\r\nily restrained in effectiveness.\n\n              &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n=\r\n              &gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching of gandanta con=\r\ncepts is quite illogical.\n              &gt; \n              &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I=\r\nt is not stretching ... it is the very definition of gandanta =C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC=E2=80=9C the interface between fire and water. Put a burning match in a=\r\n glass of water, the fire dies...There are other Ganda=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=\r\n=A2s in the chart but they are not anta (ends). Take Chitra ganda between K=\r\nanya and Tula.\n\n              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n              [Naras=\r\nimha] Putting a burning match in a glass of water does indeed kill fire. Bu=\r\nt the question is of contact. If I am thinking of fire in my mind while sta=\r\nnding in water, it does not kill the fire. There is no contact.\n\n          =\r\n    My point is that the examples given have no real identifiable contact b=\r\netween water and fire.\n\n              One can be creative and come up with =\r\na lot of theories. For example, one can say that Moon and Venus are jala ta=\r\nttva and all rasis show agni tattva (then why are some rasis marked as agni=\r\n rasis and some as water rasis etc) and hence the sign occupied by Moon and=\r\n Venus cause contact between water and fire. Then one can say fasting on th=\r\ne weekdays of the dispositors of Moon and Venus causes gandanta and serious=\r\n danger.\n\n              It is not enough to show some fire and some water. =\r\nSee what counts as contact. Otherwise, one will engage in illogical extrapo=\r\nlations.\n\n              &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n              &gt; Three ye=\r\nars back you said you are leaving jyotish....then again you told me two yea=\r\nrs back and again recently that you are leaving jyotish. Now it is getting =\r\nvery evident that *jyotish is leaving you*. The knowledge of Jyotish is PER=\r\nFECT =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C individuals embody it in different levels of =\r\ntheir understanding and intelligence. \n\n              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n\n              [Narasimha] Nothing is permanent. What is one&#39;s cannot be=\r\n taken away. And one cannot cling on to what is not one&#39;s. Some rejoice whe=\r\nn it seems like something comes and cry when it seems like something leaves=\r\n. Some impassionately observe as things seem to come and go and do what the=\r\ny see as their dharma with the things they seem to have.\n\n              Jus=\r\nt a factual correction though\n              : I never said I was leaving Jy=\r\notish. For a few years after my spiritual master entered my life, my intere=\r\nst in other things went down (though I continued to do other things) and my=\r\n focus on spiritual sadhana intensified. So I said that my interest in Jyot=\r\nish was very low. However, my guru gave me a task later. He wanted me to st=\r\nudy the teachings of Parasara independently, meditate on them and share my =\r\ninterpretations with the world. He said I was very passionate in my Jyotish=\r\n activities earlier, and he wanted me to do the same now but dispassionatel=\r\ny and without an attachment. He felt that I still have a contribution to ma=\r\nke to Jyotish and wants me to do it as an unattached karma. His word is eve=\r\nrything for me.\n\n              What I told you recently is not that I was l=\r\neaving Jyotish but what I said above.\n\n              However, if your judgm=\r\nent is correct and if Jyotish is indeed &quot;leaving&quot; me, I am sure my spiritua=\r\nl guru will realize it sooner or later and change his command to me.\n\n     =\r\n         &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n              &gt; I can categorically dec=\r\nlare one thing with utmost confidence. You pick any weekday or tithi and ta=\r\nke a vow to fast or do mouna vrata (remain silent) on that weekday or tithi=\r\n and meditate with a particular mantra (any) at the end of the day. You can=\r\n take a vow to keep that practice for a certain duration of time (say, a fe=\r\nw months or years) for a specific purpose. Take a vow and keep the vrata fo=\r\nr the duration. If brahmacharya can be kept for the duration of the vrata, =\r\nthere is nothing like it!\n              &gt; \n              &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] T=\r\nhis is a fine  statement but then you seem to be saying that the Puranas an=\r\nd other teachings of the seers is of not much relevance. Of course you are =\r\nright as it will be spiritually beneficial. For example, a person wishing t=\r\no marry should not fast on UL days and should choose any day (all days are =\r\nthe same) or any tithi (all tithi are the same) and start fasting and do a =\r\nmantra (any mantra!!) and then in a few days, or (maybe) a few months (or m=\r\naybe) a few years ... or maybe (what you did not say), a few lifetimes, the=\r\n marriage will happen! I cannot say you are wrong, so I agree that what you=\r\n say is right.\n\n              &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n              [Naras=\r\nimha] This is a gross exaggeration.\n\n              Is all that is being tau=\r\nght and practiced now strictly from &quot;Puranas and other teachings of the see=\r\nrs&quot;?\n\n              I did not say all days and tithis are the same. Of cour=\r\nse, there is some difference. But, it is not as big as being made here.\n\n  =\r\n            To make khoa, whether one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or milk=\r\n of a brown cow or a black cow or a Jersey cow or another cow does make som=\r\ne difference. But it is secondary. To say that &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas=\r\n&quot; (see the quoted mails for such claims) can be caused by a wrong choice is=\r\n wrong. To say that a wrong choice means khoa will take 100 years to make i=\r\ns also a gross exaggeration.\n\n              The main thing is that you need=\r\n milk and sugar. If one is confused by endless claims of khoa making consul=\r\ntants and ends up not making khoa at all, that will be sad. In such a case,=\r\n one can simply pick some milk or the other, take sugar and start cooking k=\r\nhoa. It will take an extra half hour, but the job will be done.\n\n          =\r\n    I request Jyotishis to behave responsibly and humbly and not engage in =\r\nscare-mongering and say that a speicifc austerity (fasting on a specific we=\r\nekday or tithi in a chart) can cause &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas&quot;. No wond=\r\ner some spiritual teachers look down upon Jyotish and dismiss it. Such unba=\r\nlanced attitude and self-importance from us does not help our cause!\n\n     =\r\n         Yes, Jyotish is helpful, but let us not oversell it or overplay th=\r\ne importance...\n\n              &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n              &gt; G=\r\nem stones may harm when used incorrectly. But, austerities like prayers, fa=\r\nsting, mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVER do you any harm. If your bod=\r\ny can take fasting, you can do it on any weekday or tithi without too many =\r\ncalculations.\n              &gt; \n              &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Brahmacharya =\r\nis good for someone planning to have a baby or one who cannot conceive and =\r\nthis is kept for some period before the appointed date of nisheka. Brahmach=\r\narya is good for marriage?! I think you are mistaking abstinence from physi=\r\ncal union as Brahmacharya.

It is funny that I should be typing this email on an E=\r\nkadashi day, when many Vaishnavas fast irrespective of their horoscopes.\n  =\r\n            &gt; \n              &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I write on dvadasi when so ma=\r\nny vasihnava also fast and keep great austerities. J Any difference?\n      =\r\n        &gt; \n              &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here is my point and view about the questio=\r\nn raised. 2nd bhava is\n              &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the bhava of Vishnu, sustainer,=\r\n and if we fast on the day of UL in\n              &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd house, we brin=\r\ng insult to Vishnu who provides the food for us.\n              &gt; \n         =\r\n     &gt; My dear Zoran, please allow me to express my disagreement.\n         =\r\n     &gt; \n              &gt; Austerities can never be seen as an insult to Vishn=\r\nu. Self-deprivation of 2nd house matters such as food (fasting) or speech (=\r\nmouna vrata - vow of silence) are austerities. Giving up food or speech is =\r\nnot an insult to Vishnu just as giving up sex (i.e. brahmacharya) is not an=\r\n insult to Sukracharya (Venus).\n              &gt; \n              &gt; [Sanjay Ra=\r\nth:] I though Brahma was very angry that his sons decided not to have proge=\r\nny and stayed celibate. So He created others. Why was Brahma angry when his=\r\n sons remained celibate? Why should Sukracharya be angry if someone is celi=\r\nbate? How is it an insult or not an insult to Sukracharya? You are taking p=\r\nlanet signification of Venus for 7H ...and linking this to creation process=\r\n...which is wrong Narasimha. Brahma is seen from lords of dusthana 6, 8 and=\r\n 12 from lagna or 7th which is....you know this.There is nothing wrong with=\r\n the 7th house as it is necessary for procreation. It is only the link of t=\r\nhis with the Brahma graha that causes it to become a serious shad-ripu. Mar=\r\nried people are as eligible for moksha as unmarried ones and bachelors. It =\r\ndepends on the following of dharma and ashrama.\n              &gt; \n          =\r\n    &gt; Various gods bestow various things on us, some at the gross physical =\r\nlevel and some at the subtle spiritual level. As we overcome our dependende=\r\nncy on gross things, we make progress at the subtle level.\n              &gt; =\r\n\n              &gt; If one eats food, a good amount of internal fire (and subt=\r\nle internal energy associated with it) is used for digesting it and for gen=\r\nerating physical energy from it. If one fasts, that subtle energy is unused=\r\n and available for other things. This is a tremendous benefit. As a result,=\r\n one can better digest mantras and spiritual food available all around one.=\r\n\n              &gt; \n              &gt; The mantra one meditates with at the end =\r\nof a day&#39;s fasting is far more effective than at other times. The conservat=\r\nion of energy otherwise spent on digestion or speech will enable far more e=\r\nffective mantra meditation. So fast or keep mouna and then meditate with a =\r\nmantra, to maximize the effect of the mantra.\n              &gt; \n            =\r\n  &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with this. Correct eating is the best ble=\r\nssing for good mantra practise. On days when one fasts the mind is troubled=\r\n by hunger causing the stomach to burn and churn and this disturbs mantra j=\r\napa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is many many times better than complete =\r\nfasting.\n              &gt; \n              &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; However, to be honest, I hav=\r\ne not heard this about 2nd lord and\n              &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tithi. The basic p=\r\noint is that Upapada is a rashi and carries energy\n              &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of =\r\nVara or day. If you fast on the day ruled by tithi of the 2nd\n             =\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala energy to vara, and gandanta may\n  =\r\n            &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come into a danger. So, what is th=\r\ne way out.\n              &gt; \n              &gt; Why does a rashi carry the ener=\r\ngy of vaara only and not that of the tithi???? Why does rashi represent vaa=\r\nra or fire?\n              &gt; \n              &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because Raashi =\r\nwere created by Surya and for doing so Surya took 12 forms called the Dvada=\r\nsa Aditya...Narasimha you ask this?? What is happening?\n              &gt; \n  =\r\n            &gt; After all, Rudra rules over the element of fire and Gouri rul=\r\nes over the element of water and one worships Gouri at the time of marriage=\r\n. Moreover, Venus (water) is the karaka for marriage. S\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
