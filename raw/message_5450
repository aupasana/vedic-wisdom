They are worshipped mostly \nin Maharastra in India. T=\r\nhose who know Marathi can read the NavNath Bhaktisar. \nThat text is not a m=\r\nere book but a powerful scripture, doing parayana of which \ncan give seriou=\r\ns spiritual benefits. There are some very old books in Bengali \ntoo which s=\r\npeak of the Nath. I am yet to trace those books. But authentic \nsources tel=\r\nl me so. For example the name of Chowrungee in Calcutta is based on \nthe na=\r\nme of Chowrungee Nath.\n \n \nIn Nepal, Goraksha and MatsyendraNath are consid=\r\nered to be household deities. \nComing to Maharastra, the Nav Nath Bhaktisar=\r\n details stories of all the 9 nath, \ntheir origin and their lives. Lineages=\r\n of the Nath are found in plenty and \nmaximum in Maharastra. This is infact=\r\n considered to be Nath Bhoomi. Krishna \ndecided to come down as Dyaneshwar,=\r\n and 9 spiritual giants came along with him \nto work. These were the Nath.\n=\r\n \nIn Buddhism for example, MatsyendraNath who is the guru of GorakshaNath i=\r\ns \nassociated with Avalokiteshwara Bodhisatva. \n\n \nThere are Kan-phattas wh=\r\no consider themselves to be of the lineage of Naths. \nThey pierce their ear=\r\nlobes as a process of initiation. Similarly there are many \nwandering mendi=\r\ncants and Aghoris who also trace their lineage to the Naths.\n \nTo say the X=\r\n or Y Ashram in Z place is the only lineage of a Nath is based on a \nfallac=\r\nious understanding of the spiritual potency of a Nath. \n\n \nJust like many i=\r\ngnorant people believe that the only Aghoris in the world are \npresent in K=\r\nasi in Kinnaram Aghoris lineage. That is a misconception.That is one \nlinea=\r\nge, but more are there which may or may not be in public view. Similarly, \n=\r\nthe tradition of the Naths - who were super Aghoris - are varied and myriar=\r\nd. \n \n-Regards\n Rajarshi \n\n\n\n________________________________\n From: Narasi=\r\nmha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nTo: Vinay Jha &lt;vinayjhaa@...&gt;\nCc: vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Mon, 13 December, 2010 9:37:08 PM\nSubject: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] Re: Gorakhnath, Naths and Dattatreya (Re: On Physical \nImmorta=\r\nlity)\n\n  \nNamaste friends,\n\nI am forwarding a mail from Vinay ji that was c=\r\nc&#39;ed to vedic-wisdom but not \ndelivered due to non-membership.\n\nNamaste Vin=\r\nay ji,\n\n&gt; In your message above, I read &quot;I am the body&quot;.

I cannot open yahoo groups. When I\n&gt; get a good internet =\r\nconnection, I may try to see vedic-wisdom.\n&gt;\n&gt; I like to hear and read spir=\r\nitual talks by others, but I really\n&gt; dislike describing my experiences. Th=\r\ne reason is simple : most of the\n&gt; persons will not believe and therefore i=\r\nt will serve no worthwhile\n&gt; purpose. In your message above, I read &quot;I am t=\r\nhe body&quot;. This feeling\n&gt; is what I endeavoured to overcome through Tapa for=\r\n years. Due to my\n&gt; efforts of self-purification, which included overcoming=\r\n Deep Sleep and\n&gt; ensure constant Japa even throughout night, I was blessed=\r\n with the\n&gt; visits of many deities and siddhas and it will be foolish to de=\r\nscribe\n&gt; these  experiences to everone. I was gaining some siddhis, but I l=\r\neft\n&gt; that road due to some unsavoury incidents. The only siddhi, if you ca=\r\nn\n&gt; call it a siddhi, that I gained through Tapa and Blessings and which I\n=\r\n&gt; want to keep is my enhanced capacity to judge things, books, persons\n&gt; an=\r\nd events. Earlier, I wasted years torn in the horns of the dilemma\n&gt; of to =\r\nbe or not to be a part of the false melodrama known as Samsaara,\n&gt; lingerin=\r\ng in the labyrinths of Doubts of all sorts. I got the correct\n&gt; answer late=\r\nr : To be AND not to be at the same time. To be, but with a\n&gt; Saaksheebhaav=\r\na. To watch not only others, but our own actions and\n&gt; thoughts, dreams, et=\r\nc, as a mere Onlooker and not as a participant;\n&gt; hence Not to be too. Shri=\r\n Mad-Bhaagavata says : &quot;aashaa hi paramam\n&gt; duHkham, nairaashyam paramam su=\r\nkham&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; One personal experience I want to share is that the Ego I was  t=\r\nhinking\n&gt; as my real Self got detached from me long ago, but I have not got=\r\n good\n&gt; riddance from it : it now abuses me but I do not care for it. I\n&gt; s=\r\nometimes keep a pretence of Ego to deal with worldly persons, but the\n&gt; rea=\r\nl Ego is a detached powerless entity watched by me. Years ago, once\n&gt; I fel=\r\nt my existence sinking down at night. I asked my\n&gt; Upastha/Jananendriya to =\r\ncome up; it answered : Brahmaa ji made my\n&gt; place at bottom, how can I come=\r\n up?? Then I realized my folly. The\n&gt; Praana should come up. Others may lau=\r\ngh at me, but the fact is that I\n&gt; could hear my indriyas and could talk to=\r\n them as if they were separate\n&gt; beings!! I gradually realized that they ac=\r\ncompany me from time\n&gt; immemorial, but I do not really belong to them, or t=\r\no this ephemeral\n&gt; Body.\n&gt; This is the real Siddhi we should all strive for=\r\n : Seal-realization.\n&gt; Japa, tapa, homam, dhyaana, etc  are all means. The =\r\nend is Constant\n&gt; Self-Awareness, awareness of the real Self which is omnip=\r\nresent,\n&gt; omniscient, disinrested and detached, yet one with everone. Veda =\r\ndoes\n&gt; not differentiate between individual soul and God. Last verse of Whi=\r\nte\n&gt; YV : &quot;yo asau Aaditya purushaH so asau aham&quot;. This normal state of\n&gt; A=\r\ntman is sama-aadhi, opposed to egoistical state which is Vyaadhi.\n&gt; Both st=\r\nates can be easily attained and retained, provided constant\n&gt; practice is m=\r\nade. Vyaadhi or Vyutthaana is easier due to past habits\n&gt; of mind and indri=\r\nyas. That is why Tapa is required for Samaadhi.\n&gt; Samaadhi needs statue-lik=\r\ne fixation of the body as well as of the\n&gt; mind, which can be attained only=\r\n through Tapa for normal humans. But\n&gt; most of the mortals in Kaliyuga want=\r\n shortcuts to evade Tapa. They do\n&gt; not know that real Dhyaana is a painful=\r\n Tapa till it becomes a normal\n&gt; habit of the  purified mind, after which d=\r\nhyaana opens the road to\n&gt; Bliss. No worldly pleasue can be compared to the=\r\n siritual bliss when\n&gt; Soul is Itself and Only Itself.\n&gt; -vj\n&gt;\n&gt; On 12/12/1=\r\n0, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nI am forwarding the reply from Sri Vinay Jha, a monk in north India. Though=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; he cc&#39;ed his reply to vedic-wisdom, it was not delivered because he is=\r\n not a\n&gt; &gt; member. So I am forwarding it (see below).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To members: I=\r\nn my limited interactions with him over the last few months, I\n&gt; &gt; have see=\r\nn that he is a man with good understanding and clear thinking. I\n&gt; &gt; usuall=\r\ny do not have any significant disagreement with him in spiritual\n&gt; &gt; matter=\r\ns. Any difference between what we say  is often because we may be \nusing\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; different words or looking at things from different angles, but not becau=\r\nse\n&gt; &gt; of fundamental differences.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vinay ji summarized it beautiful=\r\nly:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Body is primarily a means to fulfil desires. Those who have co=\r\nnquered\n&gt; &gt;&gt; desires are in no need of body. But then they get siddhis!! Wh=\r\nat an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; irony ! Those who run after siddhis do not get anything.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ..=\r\n. Striving after siddhis is the greatest folly. Siddhis are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; actually d=\r\nistractions which test the power of a yogi to concenrrate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All kind=\r\ns of siddhi are possible. They should neither be avoided nor\n&gt; &gt; pursued. T=\r\nake what comes your way, but do not desire anything. There should\n&gt; &gt; be NO=\r\nTHING that you hold as &quot;I wish I had this&quot; or &quot;I wish I did NOT have\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nis&quot;, for any attraction or  aversion will block you! As Vinay ji rightly\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; says, the irony is that one running after siddhis is often deprived of an=\r\ny,\n&gt; &gt; while one without desires may be tempted with this siddhi or that si=\r\nddhi so\n&gt; &gt; that desire may be reborn! Only after one passes all tests and =\r\nattraction\n&gt; &gt; and aversion are not born in any circumstances is one truly =\r\nfree. The above\n&gt; &gt; paragraph is a good summary of this discussion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vinay ji is wise in not wanting to talk about personal exper=\r\niences. I share\n&gt; &gt; a few of them as they are useful in highlighting some n=\r\notions and some\n&gt; &gt; lessons and in inspiring and cautioning sadhakas. I am =\r\nquoting a portion\n&gt; &gt; from http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/messa=\r\nge/3481:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  ------------ Begin Quote ------------\n&gt; &gt; I was sleeping =\r\noneday. In the middle of the night, I woke up. When I was\n&gt; &gt; still on the =\r\nbed and partially awake, my shakti rose. In other words, my\n&gt; &gt; self-awaren=\r\ness got refined. I first perceived a tremendous bolt of\n&gt; &gt; electricity goi=\r\nng up in my back. Then, in a split second, my perception of\n&gt; &gt; that electr=\r\nicity changed from &quot;shakti inside me&quot; to &quot;I inside shakti&quot;. My\n&gt; &gt; changed =\r\nperception was that there was a tremendous amount of shakti that was\n&gt; &gt; su=\r\nrging up like an ocean wave and encompassing everything that was there and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; that I was a very tiny particle in that tremendous wave. Moreover, I al=\r\nso\n&gt; &gt; &quot;heard&quot; a specific beejaakshara being chanted together by millions o=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; people, who were all tiny particles in that wave. That wave reverbera=\r\nted\n&gt; &gt; with the sound of that beejaakshara and I perceived  that I too was=\r\n chanting\n&gt; &gt; that beejaakshara along with all. My mind was filled with tha=\r\nt sound and a\n&gt; &gt; kind of bliss. My self-awareness was that of a tiny parti=\r\ncle filled with\n&gt; &gt; that sound and joy and nothing else. I was unaware of a=\r\nnything else.\n&gt; &gt; Compared to my normal mental state, it was a very simple =\r\nand yet fantastic\n&gt; &gt; state to be in. I was in that state for a while. Sudd=\r\nenly a thought that can\n&gt; &gt; be loosely expressed as &quot;Amn&#39;t I on the bed in =\r\na room? How am I hearing this\n&gt; &gt; loud sound? Are there people in the room&quot;=\r\n came to my mind. That thought\n&gt; &gt; disturbed the state of my mind and my sh=\r\nakti came down. In other words, I\n&gt; &gt; returned to the regular level of self=\r\n-awareness and again perceived that I\n&gt; &gt; was a body lying on a bed in a ro=\r\nom. The bliss was gone and mind was again\n&gt; &gt; filled with hundreds of thoug=\r\nhts as usual.\n&gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I mentioned this incident a few days later to Manish=\r\n. When this happened, it\n&gt; &gt; was the middle of the night for me and morning=\r\n for Manish. When I mentioned\n&gt; &gt; the incident and said that I heard the so=\r\nund of a beejaakshara reverberating\n&gt; &gt; in the wave in which I was a small =\r\nparticle, Manish immediately said he knew\n&gt; &gt; it and also mentioned the spe=\r\ncific beejaakshara and asked &quot;that is what you\n&gt; &gt; heard, right?&quot; That was =\r\nindeed correct. Moreover, I had never meditated with\n&gt; &gt; that beejaakshara =\r\nbefore and it is not something one would expect me to have\n&gt; &gt; a mystical e=\r\nxperience with.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When I confirmed that was the beejaakshara I heard,=\r\n Manish shed some light:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I was at that time meditating with that beeja=\r\nakshara. So and so deity came\n&gt; &gt; and filled my consciousness. I then went =\r\ninto a nice samadhi. Some people\n&gt; &gt;  close to me may also have experienced=\r\n that deity at that time. But we \nshould\n&gt; &gt; realize that this is all Her p=\r\nlay and we are just nimittas. What she does\n&gt; &gt; and why she does, she knows=\r\n and we do not. We are just dummies observing\n&gt; &gt; what comes our way. We ne=\r\nither make anything happen nor should we desire\n&gt; &gt; anything to happen. Jus=\r\nt be and observe. Do not be attracted or repelled by\n&gt; &gt; anything.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ---=\r\n---------- End Quote -------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Making someone who is thousands =\r\nof miles away (especially one who is leading\n&gt; &gt; a normal mundane life and =\r\nhas many bad samskaras!) have a specific sublime\n&gt; &gt; experience is not an o=\r\nrdinary feat. Few can do such things today. However,\n&gt; &gt; look at the attitu=\r\nde of the person who did it. See what he said in the last\n&gt; &gt; paragraph quo=\r\nted above about being just a nimitta! Rather than thinking of\n&gt;  &gt; siddhis =\r\nor striving for them, strive for cultivating such an attitude!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The =\r\nimportant thing is not whether one gets siddhis or not. That is\n&gt; &gt; irrelev=\r\nant. The important thing is whether one is fully prepared and mature\n&gt; &gt; en=\r\nough to handle any siddhis! If one is prepared, one may get control over\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; the entire universe and yet remain detached and be liberated. If one is\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; unprepared, even a very very minor siddhi may make one fall and get stuc=\r\nk in\n&gt; &gt; the cycle of birth, pursuit of desires and paybacks and death. Sad=\r\nhakas\n&gt; &gt; should forget about irrelevant things and strive for the correct =\r\nattitude\n&gt; &gt; that can take them far.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It  Yourself&quot; =\r\nritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; S=\r\npirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writing=\r\ns: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------=\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Date: Sun, 12 Dec 2010 00:05:=\r\n35 +0530\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Gorakhnath, Naths and Dattatreya (Re: On Physica=\r\nl\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Immortality)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Vinay Jha &lt;vinayjhaa@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: Nar=\r\nasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cc: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt;, Lalit Mishra\n&gt; &gt; &lt;mishra.la=\r\nlit@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; PVR is correctly expressing the=\r\n essence of Vedic philosophy, but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; physical  immortality and greater mi=\r\nracles are possible by siddhas.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Swami Ramakrishna Paramhamsa&#39;s guru Sw=\r\nami Totapuri deliberately left\n&gt; &gt;&gt; his body after completing one Divine Ye=\r\nar on Earth, equal to 360 human\n&gt; &gt;&gt; years.

He can create matter out of nothing, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; talk from gre=\r\nat distances telepathically. I know some siddhas of other\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sampradaayas=\r\n too. None of them wants physical immortality, but it is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; attainable. E=\r\nven BPHS talks of Amitaayu.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Appearing  simultaneously at many places i=\r\ns not physical replication.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Brahma-sutra talks about Nirmaana-kaayaa. =\r\nSooksma Deha can be created\n&gt; &gt;&gt; by siddhas at will and for lesser mortals =\r\nthese dehas are no less real\n&gt; &gt;&gt; than physical body. To remove my skeptici=\r\nsm, my late Guru ji had shown\n&gt; &gt;&gt; me many exaples of controllong matter fr=\r\nom 50 kilometres away. I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; personally know many living Antaryaamis who a=\r\nre perfect clairvoyants\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and more. To mortals addicted to senses, physi=\r\ncal body or physical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; world is everything, but those who soar above reg=\r\nard the physical as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; maayaa because it can be ceeated by Kalpanaa of a =\r\nsiddha. The whole\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Creation is a Kalpa.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Body is primarily a means =\r\nto fulfil desires. Those who have conquered\n&gt; &gt;&gt; desires are in no need of =\r\nbody. But then they get siddhis!! What an\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; irony ! Those who run after=\r\n siddhis do not get anything.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have some experience of these things, =\r\nbut I do not like to talk\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about personal experiences. It is wrong to s=\r\nay that Jnaana or Kriya\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yogacannot bring siddhis. All types of real Yo=\r\nga can bring siddhis.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But as the saying goes, those who strive to beco=\r\nme saints become\n&gt; &gt;&gt; satans. Striving after siddhis is the greatest folly.=\r\n Siddhis are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; actually distractions which test the power of a yogi to c=\r\noncenrrate.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -vj\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On 12/11/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@cha=\r\nrter.net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Please do not get carried aw=\r\nay with this verse. Naths are also known as\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt; Mahasiddhas. These are =\r\nnot ordinary beings. Nath means Lord or master.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Depending on how you=\r\n count them, there are either 64 or 9 of them,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; incarnated from vario=\r\nus transcendental qualities of the Lord. These are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; adept beings with=\r\n perfect mastery over various aspects of the field of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duality. They =\r\nare ever-liberated and yet are born again and again to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; show\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe path of liberation to people.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Lord Dattatreya is the origi=\r\nnal guru of all Naths. Please read his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Avadhoota Gita&quot;. There is a =\r\nnice English translation by Swami\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Asokananda (I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; think) of Ram=\r\nakrishna Mutt, which does justice. But, it is better if one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; knows Sa=\r\nnskrit and reads Sanskrit verses directly, because there is some\n&gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt; sp=\r\necial power in the combinations of words used and reading them in that\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; form has a special impact. If one reads Avadhoota Gita, one will realize=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that what I&#39;ve been writing on the goal of sadhana is consistent wi=\r\nth\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Avadhoota Gita says. So is it with what Maharshi Vasi=\r\nshtha says in Yoga\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Vaasishtham!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; While Dattatreya says =\r\n&quot;I am this body, I am that body and I am all\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bodies\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and yet I=\r\n am not a body&quot;, it is unwise to think that Gorakshanath (from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Datta=\r\ntreya&#39;s lineage!) would set as ultimate goal making a specific body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nimmortal. This is a gross misrepresentation of Gorakshanath and his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nteachings. In fact, anynody who thinks one can understand the essence of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nath&#39;s teaching from a book or a verse is fooling oneself. O=\r\nnly those\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; who\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are meant for it can benefit from the guidance =\r\nof a Nath. Others can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; see the superficial aspects of the=\r\n words attributed to a Nath. To say\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Gorakhnath&#39;s path is=\r\n about achieving &quot;Kayasiddhi&quot; is totally wrong.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Gorakshanath&#39;s path =\r\nis about liberation while living, which is described\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Avadh=\r\noota Gita, Yoga Vaasishtham and several other scriptures, and that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; d=\r\noes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; NOT mean physical immortality.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One understanding t=\r\nhe true essence of the teachings of Gorakshanath,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Matsyendranath and=\r\n Dattatreya and following their teachings perfectly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  may\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; inde=\r\ned get various siddhis though one may not actively want them. As\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Vas=\r\nishtha says in Yoga Vaasishtham, various siddhis in the field of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dua=\r\nlity\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are irrelevant to a seeker of liberation and they can even beco=\r\nme\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; hindrances. But, one truly understanding the teachings of Naths a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dattatreya will not succumb to them and will become like Shiva. M=\r\ny point\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that one who starts off thinking that physical imm=\r\noortality of a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; specific\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; physical body (or another siddhi like=\r\n that) is the goal is going to get\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; stuck at some stage.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Liberation is lack of attraction or aversion to anything in the field of\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duality - an object or an idea or a notion. Either rejection  of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; everything\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as an illusion or acceptance of everything as divine =\r\ncan make one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; eventually\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; overcome all attractions and aversion=\r\ns. Thinking of immortalizing one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; particular physical body will not h=\r\nelp one with that. In fact, a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; realized\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; person will not think =\r\n&quot;I am this body&quot;, as the quote above from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dattatreya\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shows.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, the verse quoted below says one becomes like Shiva in=\r\n the end.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Did\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Shiva strive for physical immortality? When Shi=\r\nva came to earth as Adi\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Shankara, he did not teach physical immortal=\r\nity. Instead, he taught that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; body is mithya (an illusion).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As I said, siddhas like  Trilinga Swami could manifest their physical\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bodies\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in two places at the same time. Why Trilinga Swami, my=\r\n guru&#39;s guru (Sri\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nakhate Maharaj) did that. Oneday, my guru Manish =\r\nsaw his guru standing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; front of him in physical body, showi=\r\nng hand in a blessing pose and then\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; waving it as a good bye sign. Ma=\r\nnish later found out that other\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; disciples of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nakhate maharaj =\r\nliving in various parts of the world saw a similar scene\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe same time and that Maharaj gave up his physical body in Pune at that\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; time! If one is indeed a siddha (let alone a natha) and has some contro=\r\nl\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; over matter, it may be possible to menifest and unmanifest perisha=\r\nble\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; physical bodies at will. Where does  physical immortality stand =\r\nin that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; context?!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jy=\r\notish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yours=\r\nelf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilm=\r\ns.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ----=\r\n silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Just a thought on the path of Gorakhnath.

But you are going to the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oth=\r\ner extreme when suggesting that physical immortality is the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\nighest ideal. Neither viewpoint is correct.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * *=\r\n *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ignoring the views of a stereotypical psudo-=\r\nvedantin of today, we\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can see that vedanta in fact does not s=\r\nay physical body is to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ignored. It asks us *realize* that=\r\n we are not the physical body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we are someth=\r\ning else residing in a shell called the physical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What we truly are, can neither be created nor be destroyed,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; though\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical body may perish. But, if someone curre=\r\nntly thinks that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a physical body, one ca=\r\nnnot simply ignore the physical body.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has t=\r\no *use* the physical body to eventually realize that one is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; n=\r\not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the physical body. A mere intellectual  statement of it is=\r\n not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tantamount to its realization.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Yoga Vaasishtham, Maharshi Vasishth=\r\na clearly says that action\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (karma) and knowledge (jnaana) are=\r\n two wings with which the bird\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualize=\r\nd consciousness flies into the sky of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-realization.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physical body is not to be ignored, but to be used skillfully and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carefully to perform the *right actions* that can free one.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I said earlier, one performing actions  witho=\r\nut correct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (that god is the doer of a=\r\nll actions!) is like a person who is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; walking around a mountai=\r\nn not realizing that the goal of walking\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to =\r\nreach the top. Such a person will keep walking forever and not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; reach the top. On the other hand, one having the correct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kn=\r\nowledge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not performing actions is like someone who knows =\r\nthat\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reaching\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the top of the mountain is the go=\r\nal and keeps staring at the top,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without walking. Such a pers=\r\non will remain at the base of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;  &gt; &gt; mountain. Thus, jnaana and=\r\n karma alone are not able to free one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that =\r\nis why Vasishtha compares them to two wings of a bird. The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eq=\r\nuilibrium caused by action and knowledge is what takes us\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tow=\r\nards\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liberation.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physical bodies of some siddhas may indeed remain intact =\r\nfor a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; long\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time, like centuries or millennia. B=\r\nut, eventually, they too may\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give up physical body. Someone m=\r\nentioned Vallalar, but he gave up\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  physical body, didn&#39;t he?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, to a truly liberated siddha, this dis=\r\ncussion of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immortality will sound sill=\r\ny. Self is uncreated and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indestructible,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but it=\r\ns modifications such as physical forms can be born and be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; des=\r\ntroyed at will really. A siddha, as long as one does not merge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brahman completely, can remain in an individualized *eth=\r\nereal*\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a subtle ego, even after givin=\r\ng up a physical body. One can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then create a physical body at =\r\nwill, then merge  back in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ethereal\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body aft=\r\ner a few decades or centuries or millennia and so on. So,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wha=\r\nt is the whole point of physical immortality?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nrilinga Swami (aka Telang Swami) of Kashi was a perfected\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sid=\r\ndha.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was a guru-bhai of Vimalananda. Ramakrishna Paramaham=\r\nsa\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; commented\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; during a visit to Varanasi that Tr=\r\nilinga Swami was Shiva himself.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhairavi Brahmani who came to=\r\n Dakshineshwar and taught Tantra to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna was in the li=\r\nneage of Trilinga Swami. Later, a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  grateful\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ram=\r\nakrishna revisited Kashi and fed Trilinga Swami a big\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; contain=\r\ner\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; full of rice pudding with his own hands! During his impris=\r\nonment\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the British (for walking naked in Kas=\r\nhi), he was seen by some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guards\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be in his ce=\r\nll and also walking on the prison compound wall at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same t=\r\nime. Even when he finally decided to give up his body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his disciples put his body in a container and threw it into\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ganges,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was seen after a few minutes to walk on =\r\nthe other  side.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a realized being with a hig=\r\nh enough command over duality,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; creation and destruction of ph=\r\nysical body is not a big deal.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who thinks t=\r\nhat a gold coin is special and needs to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; preserved\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; forever will struggle to do so. One who realizes that a gold\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; coin, a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gold chain, a gold ring, a golden arrow etc are=\r\n all basically the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same (gold) can melt the coin and recreate=\r\n it again. Preserving\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coin forever is an ir=\r\nrelevant goal.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;  &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; The key point is this. Trilinga Swami did not get those abilities\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because he wanted them or did a sadhana for them specifically.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The same non-dual Self fills us all. Whether X real=\r\nizes non-dual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Self or Y realizes non-dual Self, the realizati=\r\non is the same.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if one retains individual =\r\nego-consciousness and interacts with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field =\r\nof duality, different possibilities are there. One may\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engage=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in various actions using a  physical body and at the end dro=\r\np the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ego-consciousness and merge in Brahman. Or, one may eng=\r\nage in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; various actions using a physical body, then give it up=\r\n and tie\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ego-consciousness to an ethereal b=\r\nody and remain in a higher\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realm\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a long tim=\r\ne. If so, one may re-enter a physical body from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to time. But, all this is governed by one&#39;s caliber and evolution\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the field of duality. Though, all are the same =\r\nat the non-dual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; level, different beings have different calibe=\r\nr in the field of\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; duality. A rishi or Vishnu or a siddha or =\r\na natha may not be the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same as somebody else.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like Aurobindo, but I am a=\r\nfraid he lent himself vulnerable to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misinterpretation when it=\r\n comes to divinization of matter. I say\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite emphatically th=\r\nat physical immortality as an ideal and as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nend goal of one&#39;s sadhana is a dangerous idea.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThe only worthy goal is to efface individual ego, realize Self\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; and,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if  needed, engage with the world with a subtle ego an=\r\nd do\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whatever\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes spontaneously. Once heavier=\r\n conditioning is overcome,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nature\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; starts to sho=\r\nw one the role one has to play. One should just play\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the role=\r\n given to one well, instead of asking for this role or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; role.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nNarasimha\n\n\n\n \n\n\n      \r\n--0-1318279685-1292325713=:84884\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;fon=\r\nt-size:14pt&quot;&gt;goraknath has strange powers&lt;br&gt;a number of his books are in o=\r\nriginal tamil language&lt;br&gt;he seems to be in north india as well as south in=\r\ndia&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,t=\r\nimes,serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;padding-left: 5px; margin: =\r\n5px 0px 5px 5px; border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); font-family: time=\r\ns new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Tahoma&quot; s=\r\nize=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/b&gt; rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Tue, December 14, 2010 2:58:15 =\r\nPM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-=\r\nwisdom] Re:\n Gorakhnath, Naths and Dattatreya&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;meta http-equi=\r\nv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;off&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:=\r\n none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;=\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-s=\r\nize: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;There ar=\r\ne some interesting&nbsp;information about the Naths including GorakshaNath,=\r\n and quite a bit of misinformation too.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Firstl=\r\ny, the 9 Naths are considered to be immortals.

For example the name of Chowrungee in Calcutta=\r\n is based on the name of Chowrungee Nath.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;In Nepal, Goraksha and MatsyendraNath are considered to be ho=\r\nusehold deities. Coming to Maharastra, the Nav Nath Bhaktisar details stori=\r\nes of all the 9 nath, their origin and their lives. Lineages of the Nath ar=\r\ne found in plenty and maximum&nbsp;in Maharastra. This is infact considered=\r\n to be Nath Bhoomi. Krishna decided to come down as Dyaneshwar, and 9 spiri=\r\ntual giants came along with him to work. These were the Nath.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;In Buddhism for example, MatsyendraNath who is the guru of =\r\nGorakshaNath is associated with Avalokiteshwara Bodhisatva. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;There are Kan-phattas who consider themselves to be of the l=\r\nineage of Naths. They pierce their earlobes as a process of initiation. Sim=\r\nilarly there are many wandering mendicants and Aghoris who also trace their=\r\n lineage to the Naths.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;To say the X or Y Ashra=\r\nm in Z place is the only lineage of a Nath is based on a fallacious underst=\r\nanding of the spiritual potency of a Nath. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Ju=\r\nst like many ignorant people believe that the only Aghoris in the world are=\r\n present in Kasi in Kinnaram Aghoris lineage. That is a misconception.That =\r\nis one lineage, but&nbsp;more are there which may or may not be in public v=\r\niew.&nbsp;Similarly, the tradition of the Naths - who were super Aghoris - =\r\nare varied and myriard.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size: 12pt; font-family: =\r\ntimes new roman,new york,times,serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size: 12pt; =\r\nborder-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); font-family: times new roman,new y=\r\nork,times,serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Tahoma&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@c=\r\nharter.net&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Vina=\r\ny Jha &lt;vinayjhaa@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;=\r\nCc:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Mon, 13 December, 2010 9:37:08 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Re: Gorakhnat=\r\nh, Naths and Dattatreya (Re: On Physical Immortality)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am forwar=\r\nding a mail from Vinay ji that was cc&#39;ed to vedic-wisdom but not delivered =\r\ndue to non-membership.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Namaste Vinay ji,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; In your message=\r\n above, I read &quot;I am the body&quot;.

I am in full agreement with you.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Of course, knowing intellectually is one thing, tasting it now and then i=\r\ns another and being it always is yet another!

I cannot open yahoo groups. When I&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; get a good internet connection, I may try to see vedic-wisdom.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;&gt; I like to hear and read spiritual talks by others, but I really&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; dislike describing my experiences. The reason is simple : most of th=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;&gt; persons will not believe and therefore it will serve no worthwhil=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;&gt; purpose. In your message above, I read &quot;I am the body&quot;. This feel=\r\ning&lt;br&gt;&gt; is what I endeavoured to overcome through Tapa for years. Due t=\r\no my&lt;br&gt;&gt; efforts of self-purification, which included overcoming Deep S=\r\nleep and&lt;br&gt;&gt; ensure constant Japa even throughout night, I was blessed =\r\nwith the&lt;br&gt;&gt; visits of many deities and siddhas and it will be foolish =\r\nto describe&lt;br&gt;&gt; these\n experiences to everone. I was gaining some siddh=\r\nis, but I left&lt;br&gt;&gt; that road due to some unsavoury incidents. The only =\r\nsiddhi, if you can&lt;br&gt;&gt; call it a siddhi, that I gained through Tapa and=\r\n Blessings and which I&lt;br&gt;&gt; want to keep is my enhanced capacity to judg=\r\ne things, books, persons&lt;br&gt;&gt; and events. Earlier, I wasted years torn i=\r\nn the horns of the dilemma&lt;br&gt;&gt; of to be or not to be a part of the fals=\r\ne melodrama known as Samsaara,&lt;br&gt;&gt; lingering in the labyrinths of Doubt=\r\ns of all sorts. I got the correct&lt;br&gt;&gt; answer later : To be AND not to b=\r\ne at the same time. To be, but with a&lt;br&gt;&gt; Saaksheebhaava. To watch not =\r\nonly others, but our own actions and&lt;br&gt;&gt; thoughts, dreams, etc, as a me=\r\nre Onlooker and not as a participant;&lt;br&gt;&gt; hence Not to be too. Shri Mad=\r\n-Bhaagavata says : &quot;aashaa hi paramam&lt;br&gt;&gt; duHkham, nairaashyam paramam =\r\nsukham&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; One personal experience I want to share is that th=\r\ne Ego I was\n thinking&lt;br&gt;&gt; as my real Self got detached from me long ago=\r\n, but I have not got good&lt;br&gt;&gt; riddance from it : it now abuses me but I=\r\n do not care for it. I&lt;br&gt;&gt; sometimes keep a pretence of Ego to deal wit=\r\nh worldly persons, but the&lt;br&gt;&gt; real Ego is a detached powerless entity =\r\nwatched by me. Years ago, once&lt;br&gt;&gt; I felt my existence sinking down at =\r\nnight. I asked my&lt;br&gt;&gt; Upastha/Jananendriya to come up; it answered : Br=\r\nahmaa ji made my&lt;br&gt;&gt; place at bottom, how can I come up?? Then I realiz=\r\ned my folly. The&lt;br&gt;&gt; Praana should come up. Others may laugh at me, but=\r\n the fact is that I&lt;br&gt;&gt; could hear my indriyas and could talk to them a=\r\ns if they were separate&lt;br&gt;&gt; beings!! I gradually realized that they acc=\r\nompany me from time&lt;br&gt;&gt; immemorial, but I do not really belong to them,=\r\n or to this ephemeral&lt;br&gt;&gt; Body.&lt;br&gt;&gt; This is the real Siddhi we shou=\r\nld all strive for : Seal-realization.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Japa, tapa, homam, dhyaana, e=\r\ntc\n are all means. The end is Constant&lt;br&gt;&gt; Self-Awareness, awareness of=\r\n the real Self which is omnipresent,&lt;br&gt;&gt; omniscient, disinrested and de=\r\ntached, yet one with everone. Veda does&lt;br&gt;&gt; not differentiate between i=\r\nndividual soul and God. Last verse of White&lt;br&gt;&gt; YV : &quot;yo asau Aaditya p=\r\nurushaH so asau aham&quot;. This normal state of&lt;br&gt;&gt; Atman is sama-aadhi, op=\r\nposed to egoistical state which is Vyaadhi.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Both states can be easi=\r\nly attained and retained, provided constant&lt;br&gt;&gt; practice is made. Vyaad=\r\nhi or Vyutthaana is easier due to past habits&lt;br&gt;&gt; of mind and indriyas.=\r\n That is why Tapa is required for Samaadhi.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Samaadhi needs statue-l=\r\nike fixation of the body as well as of the&lt;br&gt;&gt; mind, which can be attai=\r\nned only through Tapa for normal humans. But&lt;br&gt;&gt; most of the mortals in=\r\n Kaliyuga want shortcuts to evade Tapa. They do&lt;br&gt;&gt; not know that real =\r\nDhyaana is a painful Tapa till it becomes a normal&lt;br&gt;&gt; habit of the\n pu=\r\nrified mind, after which dhyaana opens the road to&lt;br&gt;&gt; Bliss. No worldl=\r\ny pleasue can be compared to the siritual bliss when&lt;br&gt;&gt; Soul is Itself=\r\n and Only Itself.&lt;br&gt;&gt; -vj&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; On 12/12/10, Narasimha PVR Ra=\r\no &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:pvr%40charter.net&quot; target=3D&quot;_b=\r\nlank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr%40charter.net&quot;&gt;pvr@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I am forwarding the rep=\r\nly from Sri Vinay Jha, a monk in north India.

So I am forwarding it (see below).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nTo members: In my limited interactions with him over the last few months, I=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; have seen that he is a man with good understanding and clear =\r\nthinking. I&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; usually do not have any significant disagreement w=\r\nith him in spiritual&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; matters. Any difference between what we\n =\r\nsay\n is often because we may be using&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; different words or looki=\r\nng at things from different angles, but not because&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of fundame=\r\nntal differences.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Vinay ji summarized it beautifu=\r\nlly:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Body is primarily a means to fulfil desi=\r\nres. Those who have conquered&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; desires are in no need of bo=\r\ndy. But then they get siddhis!! What an&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; irony ! Those who =\r\nrun after siddhis do not get anything.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ... Striving after =\r\nsiddhis is the greatest folly. Siddhis are&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; actually distra=\r\nctions which test the power of a yogi to concenrrate.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; All kinds of siddhi are possible. They should neither be avoided nor&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; pursued. Take what comes your way, but do not desire anything. =\r\nThere should&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; be NOTHING that you hold as &quot;I wish I had this&quot; o=\r\nr &quot;I wish I did NOT have&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; this&quot;, for any attraction or\n aversio=\r\nn will block you! As Vinay ji rightly&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; says, the irony is that =\r\none running after siddhis is often deprived of any,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; while one =\r\nwithout desires may be tempted with this siddhi or that siddhi so&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; that desire may be reborn! Only after one passes all tests and attracti=\r\non&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; and aversion are not born in any circumstances is one truly=\r\n free. The above&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; paragraph is a good summary of this discussio=\r\nn.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Vinay ji is wi=\r\nse in not wanting to talk about personal experiences.

I am quoting a p=\r\nortion&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; from &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481:&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481:&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;\n --------=\r\n---- Begin Quote ------------&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I was sleeping oneday. In the mi=\r\nddle of the night, I woke up. When I was&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; still on the bed and =\r\npartially awake, my shakti rose. In other words, my&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; self-aware=\r\nness got refined. I first perceived a tremendous bolt of&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; elect=\r\nricity going up in my back. Then, in a split second, my perception of&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; that electricity changed from &quot;shakti inside me&quot; to &quot;I inside shakt=\r\ni&quot;. My&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; changed perception was that there was a tremendous amou=\r\nnt of shakti that was&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; surging up like an ocean wave and encomp=\r\nassing everything that was there and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; that I was a very tiny pa=\r\nrticle in that tremendous wave. Moreover, I also&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;heard&quot; a spe=\r\ncific beejaakshara being chanted together by millions of&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; peopl=\r\ne, who were all tiny particles in that wave. That wave reverberated&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; with the sound of that beejaakshara and I perceived\n that I too was c=\r\nhanting&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; that beejaakshara along with all. My mind was filled w=\r\nith that sound and a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; kind of bliss. My self-awareness was that=\r\n of a tiny particle filled with&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; that sound and joy and nothing=\r\n else. I was unaware of anything else.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Compared to my normal m=\r\nental state, it was a very simple and yet fantastic&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; state to b=\r\ne in. I was in that state for a while. Suddenly a thought that can&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; be loosely expressed as &quot;Amn&#39;t I on the bed in a room? How am I hearin=\r\ng this&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; loud sound? Are there people in the room&quot; came to my mi=\r\nnd. That thought&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; disturbed the state of my mind and my shakti =\r\ncame down. In other words, I&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; returned to the regular level of =\r\nself-awareness and again perceived that I&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; was a body lying on =\r\na bed in a room. The bliss was gone and mind was again&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; filled =\r\nwith hundreds of thoughts as usual.&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I mentioned =\r\nthis incident a few days later to Manish. When this happened, it&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; was the middle of the night for me and morning for Manish. When I mentio=\r\nned&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; the incident and said that I heard the sound of a beejaaks=\r\nhara reverberating&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; in the wave in which I was a small particle=\r\n, Manish immediately said he knew&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; it and also mentioned the sp=\r\necific beejaakshara and asked &quot;that is what you&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; heard, right?&quot;=\r\n That was indeed correct. Moreover, I had never meditated with&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n that beejaakshara before and it is not something one would expect me to ha=\r\nve&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; a mystical experience with.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; When =\r\nI confirmed that was the beejaakshara I heard, Manish shed some light:&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &quot;I was at that time meditating with that beejaakshara. So and so d=\r\neity came&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; and filled my consciousness. I then went into a nice=\r\n samadhi. Some people&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;\n close to me may also have experienced t=\r\nhat deity at that time. But we should&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; realize that this is all=\r\n Her play and we are just nimittas. What she does&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; and why she =\r\ndoes, she knows and we do not. We are just dummies observing&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; w=\r\nhat comes our way. We neither make anything happen nor should we desire&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; anything to happen. Just be and observe. Do not be attracted or r=\r\nepelled by&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; anything.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------- End Quote ---=\r\n----------&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Making someone who is thousands of mil=\r\nes away (especially one who is leading&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; a normal mundane life a=\r\nnd has many bad samskaras!) have a specific sublime&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; experience=\r\n is not an ordinary feat. Few can do such things today. However,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; look at the attitude of the person who did it. See what he said in the l=\r\nast&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; paragraph quoted above about being just a nimitta! Rather =\r\nthan thinking of&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt; siddhis or striving for them, strive for cul=\r\ntivating such an attitude!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The important thing is=\r\n not whether one gets siddhis or not. That is&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; irrelevant. The =\r\nimportant thing is whether one is fully prepared and mature&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; en=\r\nough to handle any siddhis! If one is prepared, one may get control over&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the entire universe and yet remain detached and be liberated. If=\r\n one is&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; unprepared, even a very very minor siddhi may make one=\r\n fall and get stuck in&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; the cycle of birth, pursuit of desires =\r\nand paybacks and death. Sadhakas&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; should forget about irrelevan=\r\nt things and strive for the correct attitude&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; that can take the=\r\nm far.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &quot;Do It\n Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedica=\r\nstrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Films that =\r\nmake a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://sar=\r\naswatifilms.org/&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: =\r\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nJyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWr=\r\nitings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Date: Sun, 12 Dec 2010 00:05:35 +0530=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Gorakhnath, Naths and Dattatreya (Re: On Phy=\r\nsical&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Immortality)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Vinay Jha &lt;&lt;a=\r\n rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vinayjhaa%40gmail.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blan=\r\nk&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vinayjhaa%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;vinayjhaa@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; To: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:=\r\npvr%40charter.net&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr%40charter.net&quot;&gt;pvr@=\r\ncharter.net&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Cc: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mai=\r\nlto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-=\r\nwisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; si=\r\nlentadmirer_in &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:silentadmirer_in%4=\r\n0yahoo.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:silentadmirer_in%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;=\r\nsilentadmirer_in@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;, Lalit Mishra&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;a rel=3D=\r\n&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:mishra.lalit%40gmail.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;mailto:mishra.lalit%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;mishra.lalit@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; PVR=\r\n is correctly expressing the essence of Vedic\n philosophy, but&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; physical\n immortality and greater miracles are possible by siddhas.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Swami Ramakrishna Paramhamsa&#39;s guru Swami Totapuri deliberat=\r\nely left&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; his body after completing one Divine Year on Eart=\r\nh, equal to 360 human&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; years. One of his disciples whom I k=\r\nnew personally requested the guru&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not to leave his discipe=\r\ns, but Totapuri ji said that though he could&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; live as long =\r\nas he wishes, this world is not for siddhas. There is&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; anot=\r\nher world for them.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I know siddha of Nath sampradaya now l=\r\niving in the Shiva Temple near&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; a creamation ground in Jamm=\r\nu. He can create matter out of nothing, and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; talk from grea=\r\nt distances telepathically. I know some siddhas of other&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; s=\r\nampradaayas too. None of them wants physical immortality, but it is&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; attainable. Even BPHS talks of Amitaayu.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Appeari=\r\nng\n simultaneously at many places is not physical replication.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; Brahma-sutra talks about Nirmaana-kaayaa. Sooksma Deha can be created&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; by siddhas at will and for lesser mortals these dehas are =\r\nno less real&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; than physical body. To remove my skepticism, =\r\nmy late Guru ji had shown&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; me many exaples of controllong m=\r\natter from 50 kilometres away. I&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; personally know many livi=\r\nng Antaryaamis who are perfect clairvoyants&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and more. To m=\r\nortals addicted to senses, physical body or physical&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; world=\r\n is everything, but those who soar above regard the physical as&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; maayaa because it can be ceeated by Kalpanaa of a siddha. The whole&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Creation is a Kalpa.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Body is primarily a m=\r\neans to fulfil desires. Those who have conquered&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; desires a=\r\nre in no need of body. But then they get siddhis!! What an&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&gt=\r\n; irony ! Those who run after siddhis do not get anything.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n I have some experience of these things, but I do not like to talk&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; about personal experiences. It is wrong to say that Jnaana or Kriy=\r\na&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yogacannot bring siddhis. All types of real Yoga can bri=\r\nng siddhis.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; But as the saying goes, those who strive to be=\r\ncome saints become&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; satans. Striving after siddhis is the g=\r\nreatest folly. Siddhis are&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; actually distractions which tes=\r\nt the power of a yogi to concenrrate.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; -vj=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; On 12/11/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;a re=\r\nl=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:pvr%40charter.net&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:pvr%40charter.net&quot;&gt;pvr@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Please do not =\r\nget carried away with this verse.
