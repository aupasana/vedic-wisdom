The fact is =\r\nthat the uttama Guru appears to sadhakas of the same stature. In the presen=\r\nt times, there is a shortage of such people. There are fewer uttama sishya =\r\nand hence there is a shortage of uttama Gurus. \n&gt; \n&gt; Again it is nothing ne=\r\nw to say that God must be the Guru. This is how it has been and will be. Li=\r\nke the sastras say - Guru, mantra and devatha are one and there should be n=\r\no difference seen between them. In the same way, the sastra say that the on=\r\ne who considers the physical being his Guru is not destined to succeed. \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Even today if a uttama Guru is born, He/She may want to attract only the=\r\n uttama sishya and not an adhama sishya. Unless one is that sishya, one wil=\r\nl always see a million defects in ones Guru- EVEN if he is a maha-siddha. T=\r\nhe fault is in the viewer. What to say of Guru, one can find fault in Devat=\r\nha as well. The problem is not with the Guru/Devatha, but with the viewer/s=\r\nadhaka who is still subject to his/her own conditioning and the accumulated=\r\n results of sins acting on him/her. The Guru as well as the Devatha are ete=\r\nrnal and our own limited personalities are not. The &#39;dress&#39; the Guru wears =\r\n( His/Her own limited personality which He/She has mostly overcome) is also=\r\n not permanent. This is why the tantras say that Guru vakya is often more p=\r\nowerful than the Guru.The vakya comes from the Devatha in the form of the G=\r\nuru. \n&gt; \n&gt; The very fact that various tantras spend time in explaining Guru=\r\n lakshanam and sishya lakshanam is very revealing about how things have bee=\r\nn for the past few 1000 years at least.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Guru as well as the devath=\r\na are never external.                Our entire sadhana lies in realisation=\r\n of this fact. \n&gt; \n&gt; People are led by their own karma to false Gurus. Ther=\r\ne is little need to look at false Gurus and despair(may be not you, but as =\r\nmany people are wont to). This is like looking at a bad husband or cheating=\r\n wife and believing that all husbands or wives are like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; There we=\r\nre very clear indications about someone like Nityananda( whom I dont condem=\r\nn for the particular aspect of having been unable to over come his human we=\r\nakness) being not a fit Guru. \n&gt; \n&gt; IMHO a sadhaka needs to be an example o=\r\nf how things or people could be in this world and provide an inspiration an=\r\nd a counter current even when things outside seem to be falling to bits.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; My apologies if I have spoken any nonsense or caused any offense.I may h=\r\nave stated the obvious in  many different ways or alluded to things without=\r\n addressing them. I do not say &#39;dont do any sadhana and keep searching for =\r\na Guru for ever&#39;; but I do not agree with giving up without searching. I am=\r\n sure anyone with a good Guru will understand what I say. All correct thing=\r\ns are Her grace and all nonsense that of my limited ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; S\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But in the times to come, the=\r\n idea of running after a guru\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will change. Each one must take God as =\r\nhis/her guru and keep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best=\r\n possible way.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I know one person with spiritual inclination who w=\r\nent on a long pilgrimage visiting many temples and ashrams in India. He was=\r\n hoping that he would meet a realized master who would bless him and give h=\r\nim a big push spiritually. He was an old classmate of Manish and Manish was=\r\n telling him from the beginning that he would not find anyone like that. Ma=\r\nnish told him to just sit at home and do intense sadhana - homam, japam etc=\r\n. But still that person wanted to go around in search of a guru who would l=\r\nift him. No need to say he did not find anyone like that.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; We indeed had spiritual masters in the past who were=\r\n capable of lifting people just like that. However, such masters are rare t=\r\noday. In fact, Paramahansa Yogananda said that great masters will no longer=\r\n descend to earth in coming years. I interpret what he said slightly differ=\r\nently. Some great masters may still descend to earth in future, but they ma=\r\ny not act like the sadgurus of past. They may only show the (a) path and le=\r\nave responsibility in the hands of people.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Why should it be so?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The age of fake swamis and babas who are secretly after name and m=\r\noney has dawned (or will soon dawn) on earth. They will pretend to be reali=\r\nzed masters though they are not. They will be difficult to discern. This is=\r\n going to render futile for many the search for a sadguru to whom one can c=\r\nompletely surrender. In the old days, if you found a sadguru, surrendered t=\r\no him/her and followed his/her commands blindly, your life would be made an=\r\nd you would achieve whatever was meant to be achieved spiritually in that l=\r\nife. However, the same cannot be said about following a fake guru blindly. =\r\nIn an age when there are probably going to be far more fake gurus than sadg=\r\nurus, isn&#39;t it advisable to rewrite the blueprint of a spiritual journey? I=\r\nnstead of searching for a sadguru and surrendering to him, it may be better=\r\n for most seekers to just do sadhana and take God or Fire as guru as Rajars=\r\nhi wisely said.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The old thinking will slowly be replaced by a new=\r\n model appropriate for the new times. What Paramahansa Yogananda said is al=\r\nong the same lines. More developments in future may re-inforce the new appr=\r\noach.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Paramahansa Yogananda said th=\r\nat great masters will not descend to earth in future. Ramakrishna Paramaham=\r\nsa said that he would be back after about 100 years accompanied by others w=\r\nho accompanied him earlier and that many people would be liberated en masse=\r\n this time. How do we reconcile?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Quite possibly, Ramakrishna will=\r\n not do any miracles or touch people and grant them liberation just like th=\r\nat, but he will probably show them how to find god. He will not take them t=\r\no god himself, but point them to a path that will lead to god. He will prob=\r\nably inspire many people to do intense sadhana and become liberated.\n&gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In the old days, we had brave kshatriyas =\r\nwho were very dharmik and unselfish. It made sense to put power completely =\r\nand unconditionally in their hands. It worked for the benefit of all. As su=\r\nch kshatriyas became rare and world started to be dominated by adharmik and=\r\n selfish seekers of power, Nature adjusted the course of humanity and most =\r\nof the world is today based on the concept of democracy or switching to it =\r\nslowly.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In spiritual matters also, we had learned braahmanas who =\r\nwere very dharmik, unselfish and liberated. it made sense to place people&#39;s=\r\n spiritual lives completely and unconditionally in their hands. As such bra=\r\nahmanas become rare and world starts to be dominated by adharmik and selfis=\r\nh possessors of knowledge (who are still in the web of Maayaa), Nature may =\r\nadjust the course of humanity and redefine religion and spiritual progress =\r\nbased on more relevant concepts and ideas.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The bottomline: If you like a guru or his teachings, benefit from t=\r\nhem. But do not worry about finding a sadguru as given in some scriptures a=\r\nnd just keep doing sadhana. Surrender to god, do homam/japam etc and wait p=\r\natiently. It is a more fruitful method than to search for a sadguru who wil=\r\nl lift you.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Software,=\r\n Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manual=\r\ns for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                   http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms=\r\n.org\n&gt; &gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; -----=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n-- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I too =\r\nbelieve we should give the benefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda.

But in the times to come,=\r\n the idea of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God as hi=\r\ns/her guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possibl=\r\ne way.

He is a fantastic teacher of spiritual conce=\r\npts. He has a charming and endearing disposition and a lucid and eloquent w=\r\nay of explaining high philosophy in simple and demystified terms. Irrespect=\r\nive of his weaknesses that may have been exposed now, he is clearly a man o=\r\nf excellent knowledge and rare wisdom.
