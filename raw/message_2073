Prashna chart of a moment gives \n&gt; &gt; the idea of action d=\r\none till that point which will dictate future \n&gt; &gt; life. my foolish, childi=\r\nsh blabbering says that the karma till that \n&gt; &gt; moment had been pre-ordain=\r\ned and the future is also DONE.

He did not know much about some of the ten \n&gt; &gt; incarnations. He de=\r\nscribed what he saw and I told him who was who and \n&gt; &gt; a little about them=\r\n. One of the forms he saw was a radiant man with \n&gt; &gt; white clothes riding =\r\na white horse on a dusty road. I told him he was \n&gt; &gt; Kalki and he hadn&#39;t c=\r\nome yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This boy is usually =\r\nplayful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I \n&gt; &gt; was with him one morning,=\r\n I saw him lost in some serious thought. This \n&gt; &gt; was abou a week after th=\r\ne episode mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I asked what he =\r\nwas thinking. He said, &quot;it is not that the \n&gt; &gt; future that is to come has =\r\nnot already happened. It has already \n&gt; &gt; happened in reality, but it will =\r\nhappen later when the time comes. You \n&gt; &gt; know what I mean?&quot; I guessed wha=\r\nt he was getting at, but pretended not \n&gt; &gt; to know. I said, &quot;no. What do y=\r\nou mean?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am t=\r\nhinking.&quot; This boy \n&gt; &gt; is not known to be overly intelligent or articulate=\r\n. His main \n&gt; &gt; characteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, swe=\r\net, kind, \n&gt; &gt; contented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today.=\r\n But he \n&gt; &gt; could not express himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I helped him, &quot;=\r\ndo you mean to say that future has already \n&gt; &gt; happened at some level, but=\r\n will reveal itself to people later? Kind \n&gt; &gt; of like a movie. A movie may=\r\n have been shot and become ready in a \n&gt; &gt; studio. Some people may have alr=\r\neady seen it. But people seeing it on \n&gt; &gt; the screen later will think it i=\r\ns happening in front of them. Are you \n&gt; &gt; saying something like that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If somet=\r\nhing \n&gt; &gt; is going to happen in future, it will happen when future comes. B=\r\nut \n&gt; &gt; somebody may be able to see it before future comes, because it has =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; already happened.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though he did not mention it, I=\r\n knew why he was thinking along \n&gt; &gt; these lines. When I told him the man r=\r\niding the horse in his vision \n&gt; &gt; over the fire was Kalki and he was yet t=\r\no come, he was probably \n&gt; &gt; confused. Given his age and ability to think a=\r\nnd understand things, \n&gt; &gt; this probably seemed like an oddity to him that =\r\nhe should see somebody \n&gt; &gt; who had not yet come. So he was trying to think=\r\n how it was possible \n&gt; &gt; and came to some important conclusions about &quot;tim=\r\ne&quot; in his own way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Time seems linear at the level of re=\r\ngular consciousness. \n&gt; &gt; However, in many planes of conssciousness, the co=\r\nncept of time becomes \n&gt; &gt; changed. It even loses its meaning when one is e=\r\nstablished in non-dual \n&gt; &gt; Aatman or Brahman or Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n* * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The same boy once performed a very short Kaali ho=\r\nmam with a \n&gt; &gt; small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara adde=\r\nd before \n&gt; &gt; name. When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt a ver=\r\ny intense \n&gt; &gt; and powerful energy. It was quite different from the energy =\r\nI feel \n&gt; &gt; normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and b=\r\nlissful \n&gt; &gt; and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am =\r\ndone \n&gt; &gt; here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my en=\r\ntire \n&gt; &gt; consciousnss.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I had experienced the same kind=\r\n of intense energy twice before \n&gt; &gt; that. Once I experienced the same ener=\r\ngy when I was meditating sitting \n&gt; &gt; next to my guru Manish who was doing =\r\na Chandi homam in India. Second \n&gt; &gt; time was when I had an unexpected oppo=\r\nrtunity to meditate inside the \n&gt; &gt; garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standin=\r\ng within 3 feet from the main \n&gt; &gt; Kaali idol there, which was sanctified a=\r\nnd worshipped by a great saint \n&gt; &gt; in the past. The energy I felt was the =\r\nsame on all the three \n&gt; &gt; occasions. At no other time did I feel that inte=\r\nnse shakti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, after we finished meditation=\r\n and opened eyes, \n&gt; &gt; that boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I=\r\n did so far, this \n&gt; &gt; is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I =\r\ndon&#39;t know how to \n&gt; &gt; say it, but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This boy performed a really simp=\r\nle and short procedure, shorter \n&gt; &gt; than what I give in manuals. But it se=\r\nemed like he was successful in \n&gt; &gt; making a powerful energy manifest there=\r\n. The bottomline is that \n&gt; &gt; internal purity is the most important thing.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritua=\r\nl better \n&gt; &gt; and get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and =\r\none has \n&gt; &gt; to keep doing it until one breaks through.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Keep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do pay \n&gt; &gt; attention=\r\n to internal purity as you engage in external practices. The \n&gt; &gt; only wort=\r\nhwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how \n&gt; &gt; smaller your eg=\r\no becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist \n&gt; &gt; attraction to extern=\r\nal things better and you can resist internal \n&gt; &gt; enemies like lust, anger,=\r\n jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma \n&gt; &gt; better. Ego - thinking tha=\r\nt this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the \n&gt; &gt; root cause of all problems.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Overcoming ego using jnaana y=\r\noga is relatively challenging, but \n&gt; &gt; bhakti yoga is easier. Think that a=\r\nll that is around you - including \n&gt; &gt; your house, money, cars, spouse, chi=\r\nldren and your own body - is god&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; property and that you are a tempora=\r\nry caretaker of all of these \n&gt; &gt; properties of god. Do the best job you ca=\r\nn, but without entertaining \n&gt; &gt; the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful serv=\r\nant takes very good care of \n&gt; &gt; his master&#39;s properties, but without think=\r\ning of all those things as \n&gt; &gt; his or her belongings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nRealize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for \n&gt; &gt; taking =\r\ngood care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes the \n&gt; &gt; best car=\r\ne of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a \n&gt; &gt; servant do=\r\nes not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept \n&gt; &gt; that is m=\r\naster&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. This enables \n&gt; &gt; one to do=\r\n the best job with what one possesses and not worry about \n&gt; &gt; what one doe=\r\ns not possess or what is out of one&#39;s control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Developi=\r\nng the attitude of a servant who takes care of master&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; properties wil=\r\nl help one wade the ocean of worldly life without \n&gt; &gt; getting caught and o=\r\nvercome ego.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ICC World Twenty20 England &#39;09 exclusively on YAHOO!
