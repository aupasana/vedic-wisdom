My comments on that is:\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. I-ness derived from Ahamkara,M=\r\nanas and Chitta has no innate power to Control any other idea of the 35 Cau=\r\nsal-ideas.\n&gt; Reason:\n&gt; Soul is the only Truth and controller, everything el=\r\nse has an unreal and derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate =\r\nwith each other, and not control each other. \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. A new-born child or a=\r\n person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sense-consciousness coherent=\r\nly due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived from Manas, that coordi=\r\nnates the senses.\n&gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty to interact =\r\nwith manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you have propos=\r\ned. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of I-ness, not=\r\n due to Buddhi.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Nitish\n&gt; \n&gt; ---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of individualized conscio=\r\nusness, which one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it =\r\nis ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Is one&#39;s ide=\r\na of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of course not! If someone says=\r\n &quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel offended or if someo=\r\nne says &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one may feel elated. One&#39;s ah=\r\namkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or praise, even though n=\r\nothing is being done to the physical body and only a name is being used. Wh=\r\nen somebody calls one by name from distance (as opposed to patting on the p=\r\nhysical body and calling), one&#39;s consciousness may still think &quot;I am being =\r\ncalled&quot; and one may turn towards the caller. As in these examples, one&#39;s I-=\r\nness does of course bind itself to more than a body.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Suppose one g=\r\nets a dream while sleeping. One may have forgotten totally about the physic=\r\nal body in the dream! One may think of something else as &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, on=\r\ne may see oneself as a different body or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself, but sti=\r\nll one may have the sense that so and so thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, ev=\r\nen when the mind is drawn away from the physical body, there is still a not=\r\nion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego p=\r\nrinciple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is a=\r\nbsolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical body=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-n=\r\ness) because they do not have physical bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni=\r\n does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he di=\r\nd not have that I-ness, he would not do everything he does.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Moreov=\r\ner, the 19 or 35 ideas of individualized consciousness do interact with eac=\r\nh other, whether we use the word &quot;control&quot; for some of those interactions o=\r\nr not. For example, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges vario=\r\nus past experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it=\r\n what to do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and =\r\nmakes them do various things. My buddhi determined what to write and my man=\r\nas told my hands to type this and I ended up typing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Your point ab=\r\nout &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totally out of place. Th=\r\ne sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the sen=\r\nsory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts of individualized=\r\n consciousness and they play different roles while interacting with each ot=\r\nher in different ways. Some of those interactions may be deemed to be contr=\r\nols.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; go in details.

There are different abstractions and breakdowns of what happens in=\r\n individualized consciousness. There are several sources that speak of diff=\r\nerent aspects of this knowledge in slightly different terms.

Your understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to th=\r\ne ideational or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the phys=\r\nical body (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a p=\r\nhysical/astral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara like we =\r\ndo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas=\r\n (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sens=\r\ne of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized c=\r\nonsciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The=\r\nre is a fine line between the sense of I-ness attributed to the Individual =\r\nSoul and the sense of I-ness derived through the idea of Ahamkara. Even aft=\r\ner a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom =\r\nis not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), while it has already given up=\r\n the idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Individuality=\r\n of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What =\r\nexists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being on=\r\ne of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account for neither controls =\r\nthe rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, without requ=\r\niring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always inte=\r\nrfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life-f=\r\norces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body are =\r\nthe basic causal forces and are not related as cause-effect to each other. =\r\nThus, each is independent of the application of the sense of I-ness derived=\r\n from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their funct=\r\nioning as well as existence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by=\r\n the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Bud=\r\ndhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t =\r\nwork upon that particular idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-=\r\nness is the very basis of the entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through th=\r\ne Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Ast=\r\nral and Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see=\r\n the human activities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individ=\r\nualized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not th=\r\ne same as for an astral/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An Astral-bodied being t=\r\nhinks of Manas/sense- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individ=\r\nualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/percept=\r\nive- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized conscious=\r\nness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, that individuality is of the Soul not derived from any=\r\n idea, which is why it is not lost when the Astral being loses astral consc=\r\niousness and reincarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As an example,=\r\n Devatas, with their finer bodies, are able to work through all the beings =\r\nin all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the Moo=\r\nladhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never getting controlled by A=\r\nhamkara that would require them to say that this particular body is &quot;my bod=\r\ny&quot; or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies themselve=\r\ns. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so they would attemp=\r\nt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipper.=\r\n Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; physical body as =\r\nwell as act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four antah=\r\nkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (e=\r\ngo or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and r=\r\nemain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul of Sri Yukt=\r\neswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Causal body is a matrix of =\r\n35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Budd=\r\nhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 functions of Action, 5 functions =\r\nof life-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical body (16 chemical elements)=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as we all know that Physical body expires as a whole, n=\r\not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising it go away at a time, Astr=\r\nal and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole in the corresponding cosm=\r\nic consciousness - instead of different constituent ideas slipping out of i=\r\nt at different times. Chitta being the staging idea for all other modificat=\r\nions, can be termed as the last to go, when the causal body is finally drop=\r\nped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of =\r\nAhamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Manas with Subtle =\r\nAstral vibrations and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta with infinitely Subtle Causal Vibration=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi being another variable, can be developed or undevelo=\r\nped irrespective of the other 34. Even illiterate Moodha, through surrender=\r\n to their Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkara and so on...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW,=\r\n Chitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store the residual impress=\r\nions of all the past incarnations. However, being constituted of Satwa Guna=\r\n, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impression=\r\ns, just like a container containing an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatic=\r\nally burn it down. Sadhana is required for That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Samskaras stored=\r\n by Chitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, =\r\ncorrespond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence =\r\nthe &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous ma=\r\nil). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo-g=\r\nuni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all r=\r\nesidual impressions, only Satva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coheren=\r\nt and the Soul reflects on itself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (=\r\nChitta), thus realizing its own nature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\nn Patanjali Yoga Sutras: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore katmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instrument of seeing. P=\r\natanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied bei=\r\nngs can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear, smell, taste and so o=\r\nn (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of egoism does not take root=\r\ns in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karma. Similarly, Caus=\r\nal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, E=\r\ngotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is associated with the =\r\nPhysical Body sensory activities or has Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The=\r\n idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousness , must be overcome=\r\n in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43=\r\n) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who cannot be temp=\r\nted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted to st=\r\nay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-cons=\r\nciousness which is associated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Su=\r\ntras also it is mentioned in the same manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dristanushravik=\r\na vishaya vitrishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; That eff=\r\nect which comes to these who have given up their thirst after objects, eith=\r\ner seen or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non-attachment=\r\n. Vivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to Ast=\r\nral-Body and working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as an astral-bodied =\r\nbeing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yogashchittavrittin iro=\r\ndhah -2-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, extinguishing all the movements of Chitta is called &quot;Y=\r\noga&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciou=\r\nsness to Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or otherwise as a cau=\r\nsal-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha=\r\n PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I a=\r\nm afraid you are mixing up terminologies. For example, ego or ahamkaara (se=\r\nnse of I-ness) is not limited to the physical body, but extends to subtle b=\r\nody and causal body as well. In fact, ego resides in the causal body and af=\r\nfects other bodies. Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or co=\r\nnditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana sare=\r\nera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego c=\r\nontrols manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-motor mind) observes sen=\r\nsory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or thinking mind) analyzes current and =\r\npast observations of mind or chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) store=\r\ns various observations or retrieves previously stored observations, they ar=\r\ne all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness permeates through=\r\n all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upanish=\r\nads and various scriptures have broken down the individualized consciousnes=\r\ns into various groups by functionality, like five koshas, three sareeras, f=\r\nive praanas, five jnaanendriyas, five karmendriyas, four antahkaranas, six/=\r\nseven chakras etc. But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entir=\r\ne individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though the word jnaana mea=\r\nns different things to different people, a jnaana yogi pursues Self by the =\r\npath of contemplation and discrimination.

My comments on tha=\r\nt is:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1.

A new-born chil=\r\nd or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sense-consciousness co=\r\nherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived from Manas, that =\r\ncoordinates the senses.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty =\r\nto interact with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you=\r\n have proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of=\r\n I-ness, not due to Buddhi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I hope this clarifies.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nitish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yah=\r\noogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of i=\r\nndividualized consciousness, which one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am =\r\nthat&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physi=\r\ncal body? Of course not! If someone says &quot;so and so person is a terrible pe=\r\nrson&quot;, one may feel offended or if someone says &quot;so and so person is a grea=\r\nt person&quot;, one may feel elated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying wit=\r\nh the criticism or praise, even though nothing is being done to the physica=\r\nl body and only a name is being used. When somebody calls one by name from =\r\ndistance (as opposed to patting on the physical body and calling), one&#39;s co=\r\nnsciousness may still think &quot;I am being called&quot; and one may turn towards th=\r\ne caller. As in these examples, one&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself to =\r\nmore than a body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dream while=\r\n sleeping. One may have forgotten totally about the physical body in the dr=\r\neam! One may think of something else as &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself=\r\n as a different body or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one may have t=\r\nhe sense that so and\n so thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind=\r\n is drawn away from the physical body, there is still a notion of &quot;I am thi=\r\ns&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is=\r\n absolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical bo=\r\ndy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agni do no=\r\nt have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have physical bodies is incorr=\r\nect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and this is =\r\nwhat I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he would not do everything he d=\r\noes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individuali=\r\nzed consciousness do interact with each other, whether we use the word &quot;con=\r\ntrol&quot; for some of those interactions or not. For example, buddhi (intellect=\r\nual/ discriminating mind) judges various past experiences, interacts with m=\r\nanas\n (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then manas interacts wi=\r\nth karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do various things. My bud=\r\ndhi determined what to write and my manas told my hands to type this and I =\r\nended up typing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what exists a=\r\ns a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totally out of place. The sense of I-ness,=\r\n the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, k=\r\narmendriyas etc are all different parts of individualized consciousness and=\r\n they play different roles while interacting with each other in different w=\r\nays. Some of those interactions may be deemed to be controls.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;=\r\nt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; go in details.

Your understanding is flawed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; =\r\n1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the ideatio=\r\nnal or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the physical body=\r\n (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a physical/a=\r\nstral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara like we do.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddh=\r\ni also. When manas (sensory-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided =\r\nby the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permea=\r\ntes through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this up ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a fine line between the sense of I-ness attribut=\r\ned to the Individual Soul and the sense of I-ness derived through the idea =\r\nof Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individual=\r\nity of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection implies\n that), while i=\r\nt has already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Individuality of a causal-bodied being is =\r\nnot due to the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What exists as a part cannot be th=\r\ne whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Caus=\r\nal-body, doesn&#39;t account for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Eac=\r\nh idea is independent of another, without requiring another idea to act upo=\r\nn it - otherwise your buddhi would always interfere with the functioning of=\r\n Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the b=\r\nasic causal forces and are not related as cause-effect to each other. Thus,=\r\n each is independent of the application of the sense of I-ness derived from=\r\n Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functionin=\r\ng as well as existence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor\n &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the=\r\n idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi =\r\nor Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work=\r\n upon that particular idea.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the=\r\n Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astr=\r\nal and Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see =\r\nthe human activities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individu=\r\nalized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the=\r\n same as for an astral/causal bodied being.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; An Astral-bod=\r\nied being thinks of Manas/sense- consciousness as the very basis of the ent=\r\nire individualized\n consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being =\r\nthinks of Chitta/perceptive- consciousness as the very basis of the entire =\r\nindividualized consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; However, that individuality=\r\n is of the Soul not derived from any idea, which is why it is not lost when=\r\n the Astral being loses astral consciousness and reincarnates in the Physic=\r\nal body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As an example, Devatas, with =\r\ntheir finer bodies, are able to work through all the beings in all their ph=\r\nysical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni d=\r\nigests the food, and so on..), never getting controlled by Ahamkara that wo=\r\nuld require them to say that this particular body is &quot;my body&quot; or that one =\r\nis mine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies themselves. Devatas are,=\r\n however, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so they would attempt to influence =\r\nthe Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the =\r\nother hand,\n would attempt to possess ones&#39; physical body as well as act ou=\r\nt their Ahamkara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaar=\r\nana &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul of Sri =\r\nYukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astr=\r\nal body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 funct=\r\nions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical=\r\n body (16 chemical elements).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as =\r\nwe all know that Physical body expires as a whole, not just one or two of t=\r\nhe 16 elements comprising it go away at a time, Astral and Causal bodies ar=\r\ne\n also cast off as a whole in the corresponding cosmic consciousness - ins=\r\ntead of different constituent ideas slipping out of it at different times. =\r\nChitta being the staging idea for all other modifications, can be termed as=\r\n the last to go, when the causal body is finally dropped - hence I wrote as=\r\n rising above Chitta.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the idea o=\r\nf Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Mana=\r\ns with Subtle Astral vibrations and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta with infinite=\r\nly Subtle Causal Vibrations.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi be=\r\ning another variable, can be developed or undeveloped irrespective of the o=\r\nther 34. Even illiterate Moodha, through surrender to their Guru, attain fr=\r\needom from Ahamkara and so on...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, =\r\nChitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store the residual impressi=\r\nons of all the past incarnations. However, being constituted of Satwa\n Guna=\r\n, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impression=\r\ns, just like a container containing an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatic=\r\nally burn it down. Sadhana is required for That.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The Sams=\r\nkaras stored by Chitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyay=\r\na, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva G=\r\nuna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my=\r\n previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned b=\r\ny the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Once the Chitta calm=\r\ns down, cleared of all residual impressions, only Satva Guna remains, the i=\r\nntuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on itself as distinct from =\r\nSatva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its own nature as Brahman.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 5. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yog=\r\na Sutras: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore\n katmataivasmita -6&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instrument of=\r\n seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\nince astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear,=\r\n smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of ego=\r\nism does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral =\r\nKarma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out w=\r\nhile the consciousness is associated with the Physical Body sensory activit=\r\nies or has Physical Karma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea=\r\n of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousness , must be overcome in A=\r\nstral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) whe=\r\nre Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who cannot be tempted t=\r\no go back to the pleasing to the eye\n Astral cosmos are permitted to stay p=\r\nermanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-consciou=\r\nsness which is associated with Manas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nIn Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in the same manner :&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; dristanushravika vishaya vitrishnasya vashikar=\r\na samjnavairagyam -15-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; That effect whi=\r\nch comes to these who have given up their thirst after objects, either seen=\r\n or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non-attachment. Vivek=\r\nananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to freedom.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the con=\r\nsciousness to Astral-Body and working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as =\r\nan astral-bodied being.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Y=\r\noga Sutras:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; yogashchittavrittin irodhah -2-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Thus, extinguishing all\n the movements of Chitta is called &quot;Yoga&quot;. &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferri=\r\nng the consciousness to Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or oth=\r\nerwise as a causal-bodied being.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I hop=\r\ne this clarifies.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Nitish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yah=\r\noogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; I am afraid you are mixing up terminologies. For example, ego o=\r\nr ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limited to the physical body, but exte=\r\nnds to subtle body and causal body as well.

One pursuing t=\r\nhat path may or may not debate with others and may or may not read many scr=\r\niptures, but one will analyze and debate within oneself. One starts with th=\r\ne basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and without a beginning or an end=\r\n). One will go on eliminating things that one is aware of as not being Self=\r\n. For example, body has a beginning and end and is perishable. So it is not=\r\n Self. One introspects like this and, though the process of elimination, fi=\r\nnally finds the true Self. That is gyaana yoga. Pure gyaana yoga is very di=\r\nfficult to follow in this age.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vichaara (contemplation) is the process of sadhana f=\r\nor an adherer of pure gyaana yoga.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, the gyaana (knowledge of Self)\n achieve=\r\nd by such a person at the end is not really different from the knowledge of=\r\n Self achieved by a person following another path.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Try the new Yahoo!
