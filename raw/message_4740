One of the largest solar=\r\n storms in recent times has started occuring starting from the sunday of la=\r\nst week and this solar storm is directly aimed at earth unlike the previous=\r\n ones.\n\nI have read previously articles from Vedic astrology gurus on the 1=\r\n1 yr period of solar cycles and effect on earth. I personally feel maybe th=\r\nis is also in line with the changes taking place and descent of some good s=\r\nouls onto earth in the coming decade. Solar storms affect human beings a lo=\r\nt since they can generate huge geomagnetic fields.\n\nArticle is below.\n\nhttp=\r\n://news.yahoo.com/s/space/20100803/sc_space/spectacularnorthernlightsshowsi=\r\ngnalssuniswakingup\n\nSpectacular Northern Lights Show Signals Sun Is Waking =\r\nUp\n\n  SPACE.com Staff\n\nSPACE.com Space.com Staff\n\nspace.com =96 Tue Aug 3, =\r\n1:00 am ET\n\nSkywatchers at high latitudes could be in for a spectacular tre=\r\nat of northern lights, the aurora borealis, Tuesday and Wednesday: After a =\r\nrelatively quiet stretch, it appears the sun is ramping up its activity.\n\nT=\r\nhe sun&#39;s surface erupted early Sunday, blasting - tons of plasma (ionized a=\r\ntoms) into space. These atoms are headed toward Earth and could create a st=\r\nunning light show in the process.\n\n&quot;This eruption is directed right at us a=\r\nnd is expected to get here early in the day on Aug. 4th,&quot; said Leon Golub o=\r\nf the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics. &quot;It&#39;s the first major Ea=\r\nrth-directed eruption in quite some time.&quot;\n\nThe solar eruption, called a co=\r\nronal mass ejection, was spotted by NASA&#39;s Solar Dynamics Observatory , whi=\r\nch captures high-definition views of the sun at a variety of wavelengths. S=\r\nDO was launched in February and peers deep into the layers of the sun, inve=\r\nstigating the mysteries of its inner workings. \n\n\nWe got a beautiful view o=\r\nf this eruption,&quot; Golub said. &quot;And there might be more beautiful views to c=\r\nome if it triggers aurorae.&quot;\n\nViews of aurorae are usually associated with =\r\nCanada and Alaska, but even skywatchers in the northern U.S. mainland are b=\r\neing told they can look toward the north Tuesday and Wednesday evenings for=\r\n rippling &quot;curtains&quot; of green and red light.\n\n[Photos: Stunning new views f=\r\nrom space]\n\nWhen a coronal mass ejection reaches Earth, solar particles str=\r\neam down our planet&#39;s magnetic field lines toward the poles. In the process=\r\n, the particles collide with atoms of nitrogen and oxygen in the Earth&#39;s at=\r\nmosphere, which then glow, creating an effect similar to miniature neon sig=\r\nns.\n\nThe interaction of the solar particles with our planet&#39;s magnetic fiel=\r\nd has the potential to create geomagnetic storms, or disturbances in Earth&#39;=\r\ns magnetosphere. And while aurorae are normally visible only at high latitu=\r\ndes, they can light up the sky even at lower latitudes during a geomagnetic=\r\n storm.\n\nThe sun&#39;s activity usually ebbs and flows on a fairly predictable =\r\ncycle. Typically, a cycle lasts about 11 years, taking roughly 5.5 years to=\r\n move from a solar minimum, a period of time when there are few sunspots, t=\r\no peak at the solar maximum, during which sunspot activity is amplified.\n\nT=\r\nhe last solar maximum occurred in 2001. The latest minimum was particularly=\r\n weak and long- lasting. The most recent solar eruption is one of the first=\r\n signs that the sun is waking up and heading toward another maximum. \n\n\n"}}
