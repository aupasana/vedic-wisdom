Let me try to put all this into a perspective here.=C2=A0\n\nNow my und=\r\nerstanding is that all these four different path lead to the same point or =\r\nthe end result and that is self realization. No matter what path or approac=\r\nh you take the end result or the truth has to be the same. It cannot be two=\r\n different thing for two different people and in that case it is not the Tr=\r\nuth. The path one adopts may be of hindu persuasion or some other religious=\r\n persuasion the end result has to be the same. Not only the end result one =\r\nhas to come to a point where one has an insight or a perception that finish=\r\nes the ego or self directed activity.=C2=A0\n\nKarma is a natural result of t=\r\nhe freedom that Nature has bestowed upon man. Karma has no meaning without =\r\nfreedom to act. I do mistakes and create imbalance only when I have freedom=\r\n to act and as such I have pay it back and restore balance in Nature. To ha=\r\nve the freedom to act I have to accept Karma too. It all makes perfect sens=\r\ne to me.=C2=A0\n\nNow due to karmic overload it may become very hard for larg=\r\ne numbers of people to get out of this cycle. I am not sure if Nature allow=\r\ns one to be free of this attachment without a payback. Now there is a train=\r\n of thought which says that one can look into the whole nature of this atta=\r\nchment at one shot and can be free of it. Instead of fixing one thing after=\r\n another look at this whole thing to the root , have a perception and get o=\r\nut of it. In a sense our ancestors were intelligent that they devised some =\r\nway to clear this Karma but it seems like for large numbers of people these=\r\n will become crutches rather than help to get out of the karmic cycle and l=\r\nead an existence where one is free to act. If my previous karma is influenc=\r\ning my action then I am not free.=C2=A0\n\nIs it possible for someone to look=\r\n into this whole process of attachment and have an insight and be free of i=\r\nt right now....\n\n\n________________________________\n From: Narasimha P.V.R. =\r\nRao &lt;pvr108@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com&gt; \nCc: &quot;sohamsa@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;sohamsa@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSen=\r\nt: Saturday, August 24, 2013 11:44 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: which pat=\r\nh to choose?-a dialog\n \n\n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaste Sir,\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Dont you think all =\r\nthese yogas are NOT an end in itself but to prepare the mind for awakening?=\r\n?\n=C2=A0\nCorrect. These paths get one started in the walk towards the same =\r\nend point - Self-realization.\n\n=C2=A0\n&gt; To be free is to be awakened.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nNot exactly. Awakening is just a step towards freedom. Freedom comes in=\r\n the end after walking a path for enough time after awakening.\n=C2=A0\nAn un=\r\nawakened sadhaka practicing jnana yoga reads books and talks eloquently abo=\r\nut how everything is god, but looks at different people, objects and experi=\r\nences with a different attitude. He becomes happy (if not externally, atlea=\r\nst internally) when people praise him and becomes upset when people critici=\r\nze him, and so on. An awakened sadhaka practicing jnana yoga starts to hone=\r\nstly contemplate one&#39;s actions, words, thoughts (and even instincts finally=\r\n) and slowly weeds out conditioning that makes one look at different transi=\r\nent things differently. As his equanimity increases, still there will be ep=\r\nisodes of getting carried away. As he employs contemplation and self-correc=\r\ntion more and more, such episodes will become less and less frequent and on=\r\ne will become liberated in the end.\n=C2=A0\nAn unawakened sadhaka practicing=\r\n karma yoga passionately engages in dharmik actions for the benefit of othe=\r\nrs. He gets elated and feels proud when good results come and becomes upset=\r\n when bad results come. An awakened sadhaka practicing karma yoga starts to=\r\n have detachment to results. When something happens which makes him elated,=\r\n proud, ashamed or upset, he will not think much about it, take it as god&#39;s=\r\n prasad and think about what is the right action for him right now. As his =\r\ndetachment increases, still there will be episodes of getting carried away.=\r\n As one becomes more and more detached (to results of actions), such episod=\r\nes will become less and less frequent and one will become liberated in the =\r\nend.\n=C2=A0\nAn unawakened sadhaka practicing raja yoga goes through yama, n=\r\niyama, pratyahara, dhyana, dharana etc. His psychic life force may even ari=\r\nse and ascend. He may have various experiences and may feel proud or become=\r\n attached to them. An awakened sadhaka practicing raja yoga will not not lo=\r\nse self-control in the face of anything and will keep the focus on samadhi.=\r\n He will not be distracted by anything that comes on the way and keep perfe=\r\ncting concentration and self-control so that samadhi (deep concentration on=\r\n the unconditioned Self) comes. In the beginning, one may be in samadhi sta=\r\nte now and then. As practice is perfected, one can be in it all the time an=\r\nd become liberated.\n=C2=A0\nAn unawkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga is d=\r\nevoted to god and worships him/her as much as one can, but will project his=\r\n ego, conditioning and desires onto his worship and hence onto the god he w=\r\norships. For example, he may think &quot;I worship the highest god while that pe=\r\nrson worships a lower god. I am better&quot; or &quot;I am worshipping god everyday. =\r\nI will get so and so result&quot; or &quot;I worship god more than that person. I am =\r\nbetter&quot;. An awkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga has little expectation, =\r\npride etc. Worship becomes not about him but about god! He worships god and=\r\n marvels at the power that holds this cosmos together - the power that runs=\r\n things infinitismally smaller than a boson and infinitely larger than a ga=\r\nlaxy. He will look at himself as a fully insignificant particle in front a =\r\nsupreme power. His desires, likes, dislikes, conditioning and agendas start=\r\n to seem too insignificant in front of contemplating about that supreme pow=\r\ner. Even as that\n devotional spirit increases, there will be episodes when =\r\none becomes self-centered in one&#39;s worship. But with practice, one loses on=\r\neself completely and surrenders completely to the supreme power and become =\r\nliberated in the end.\n=C2=A0\nIn each path, one may walk the path without ma=\r\nking any significant progress for a long time. As one starts to imbibe the =\r\ninherent qualities of the path, some internal transformation will kick in. =\r\nYet, the force of prior conditioning, coming from many lives, is too strong=\r\n to overcome.

The purpose behind a=\r\nll this should be to free oneself from karmic bindings and be free of the =\r\n=C2=A0bondage. That has to be the core purpose of any type of yoga.

It=\r\n is very much\n&gt;&gt; possible and in fact is a measure of self realized people.=\r\n\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Indeed, one can carve one&#39;s own niche by combining multiple paths=\r\n. They are not meant to be mutually exclusive.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;I&#39;ll quote Swami Vi=\r\nvekananda from his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; where he makes a comment on the 4 paths=\r\n:\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&quot;Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this d=\r\nivinity\n within by controlling\n nature: external and internal. Do this eith=\r\ner by work or worship or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, =\r\nor all of these - and be free.&quot;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Here are my 2 cents.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Jnan=\r\na yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on =\r\nwork and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-mastery.=\r\n Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One can pick =\r\nwhatever is natural to one and try to develop that quality. However, wisdom=\r\n, detached action, self-control and surrender to the Supreme are not mutual=\r\nly exclusive. As one of these qualities develops nicely in one, others will=\r\n automatically develop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; =\r\nor oneness) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Forget =\r\nabout horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that,=\r\n I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrish=\r\nna advised\n against it. Controlling body and mind and forcing the psychic l=\r\nife force to purify and ascend requires strict yama and niyama and clean na=\r\ndis. In this age of polluted air, water and food, nadis accumulate great am=\r\nounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just my v=\r\niew, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught in &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one=\r\n of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishy=\r\nas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekananda, but did not encour=\r\nage even him to practice it.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is=\r\n a distinct danger of falling into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. Pe=\r\nople of this age are not sincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to =\r\ndelude that &quot;all is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it&#39;s ok - it does=\r\nn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s all a delusion anyway&quot; without fully overcoming all innate=\r\n conditioning that reinforces duality in consciousness every instant. Kind\n=\r\n of like declaring wisely in a movie that &quot;it&#39;s just a movie and not realit=\r\ny&quot;, but flinching in every scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. With=\r\nout absolute honesty, sincerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problema=\r\ntic too. A long path of constant contemplation and self-correction can be r=\r\neduced to a quick delusional jump to the end.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;IMHo, for most peopl=\r\ne in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are the most suitable and safest.=\r\n\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;--------\n&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Reso=\r\nurces: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n&gt;--------\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;--- In sohamsa@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, Vishnu Jandhyala &lt;jvishnu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Ms. Maja,\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Namaste\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Now different type of 4 yogas based on ayana/kendra:\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dharma ayana - Gyana yoga- lagna and its trines\n&gt;&gt;\n &gt; Artha ayana =\r\n- Karma yoga -\n 10th bhava and its trines\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Kama ayana - Raja yoga- 7th =\r\nbhava and its trines\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Moksha ayana - Bhakti yoga - 4th bhava and its tr=\r\nines\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagavat Gita, you can check it,=\r\n I assure\n&gt;&gt; &gt; there are four of them.

Let me try to put all this into a perspective here.&nbsp;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;t=\r\nimes new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transparent; f=\r\nont-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0=\r\n);\n font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, ser=\r\nif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now my unders=\r\ntanding is that all these four different path lead to the same point or the=\r\n end result and that is self realization. No matter what path or approach y=\r\nou take the end result or the truth has to be the same. It cannot be two di=\r\nfferent thing for two different people and in that case it is not the Truth=\r\n. The path one adopts may be of hindu persuasion or some other religious pe=\r\nrsuasion the end result has to be the same. Not only the end result one has=\r\n to come to a point where one has an insight or a perception that finishes =\r\nthe ego or self directed activity.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: r=\r\ngb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, t=\r\nimes, serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0,\n 0);font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;=\r\ntimes new roman&#39;, &#39;new\n york&#39;, times, serif;background-color:transparent;fo=\r\nnt-style:normal;&quot;&gt;Karma is a natural result of the freedom that Nature has =\r\nbestowed upon man. Karma has no meaning without freedom to act. I do mistak=\r\nes and create imbalance only when I have freedom to act and as such I have =\r\npay it back and restore balance in Nature. To have the freedom to act I hav=\r\ne to accept Karma too. It all makes perfect sense to me.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;=\r\n, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: norm=\r\nal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-fam=\r\nily: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transpa=\r\nrent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Now due to karmic overload it may become very ha=\r\nrd for large numbers of people to get out of this cycle. I am not sure if N=\r\nature allows one to be free of this attachment without a payback. Now there=\r\n is a train of\n thought which says that one can look into the whole nature =\r\nof this attachment at one shot and can be free of it. Instead of fixing one=\r\n thing after another look at this whole thing to the root , have a percepti=\r\non and get out of it. In a sense our ancestors were intelligent that they d=\r\nevised some way to clear this Karma but it seems like for large numbers of =\r\npeople these will become crutches rather than help to get out of the karmic=\r\n cycle and lead an existence where one is free to act. If my previous karma=\r\n is influencing my action then I am not free.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;colo=\r\nr: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york=\r\n&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times=\r\n new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transparent; font-=\r\nstyle: normal;&quot;&gt;Is it possible for someone to look into this whole process =\r\nof\n attachment and have an insight and be free of it right now....&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, tim=\r\nes, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;,=\r\n &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D=\r\n&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;=\r\n&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha P.V.R.

He will look at himself as a fully ins=\r\nignificant\n particle in\n front a supreme power. His desires, likes, dislike=\r\ns, conditioning and agendas start to seem too insignificant in front of con=\r\ntemplating about that supreme power. Even as that devotional spirit increas=\r\nes, there will be episodes when one becomes self-centered in one&#39;s worship.=\r\n But with practice, one loses oneself completely and surrenders completely =\r\nto the supreme power and become liberated in the end.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In each =\r\npath, one may walk the path without making any significant progress for a l=\r\nong time. As one starts to imbibe the inherent qualities of the path, some =\r\ninternal transformation will kick in. Yet, the force of prior conditioning,=\r\n coming from many lives, is too strong to overcome.

They are not meant to be mutually exclusive.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ll=\r\n quote Swami Vivekananda from his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; where he makes a comment=\r\n on the 4 paths:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is=\r\n to manifest this divinity\n within by controlling\n nature: external and int=\r\nernal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control, or philosophy =\r\n- by one, or more, or all of these - and be free.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Here are my=\r\n 2 cents.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom=\r\n. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on sel=\r\nf-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrende=\r\nr to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try to develop th=\r\nat quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and surrender to=\r\n the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualities develops=\r\n nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally, a realized =\r\nperson (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or oneness) will have all these qualities fully =\r\nblossomed.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatr=\r\namsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for =\r\n99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised\n against it. Controlling body and=\r\n mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend requires stri=\r\nct yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, water and =\r\nfood, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be d=\r\nangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught =\r\nin &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He d=\r\niscouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to =\r\nVivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Jn=\r\nana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the d=\r\nelusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/honest/=\r\nsmart enough for it. It is easy to delude that &quot;all is Brahman. I am Brahma=\r\nn. Whatever I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s all a delusion anyway&quot; =\r\nwithout fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces duality in=\r\n consciousness every instant. Kind\n of like declaring wisely in a movie tha=\r\nt &quot;it&#39;s just a movie and not reality&quot;, but flinching in every scary scene, =\r\ncrying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely and earn=\r\nestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constant contemp=\r\nlation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional jump to the=\r\n end.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma=\r\n yoga are the most suitable and safest.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Naras=\r\nimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofol=\r\nlow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;--- In sohamsa@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, Vishnu Jandhyala &lt;jvishnu@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Dear Ms.=\r\n Maja,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Now different type of 4 yo=\r\ngas based on ayana/kendra:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Dharma ayana - Gyana y=\r\noga- lagna and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt; Artha ayana - Karma yoga -\n 10th bh=\r\nava and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Kama ayana - Raja yoga- 7th bhava and its t=\r\nrines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Moksha ayana - Bhakti yoga - 4th bhava and its trines&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagavat Gita, you can =\r\ncheck it, I assure&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; there are four of them.
