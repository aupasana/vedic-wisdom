One day I had a phone call\nfrom the guy who =\r\nhad won the Nobel Prize for uniting two of the four\nfundamental forces of t=\r\nhe physical universe (the electro weak force).\nHis name was Abdus Salam. He=\r\n was the founder and director of the\nInternational Centre for Theoretical P=\r\nhysics in Trieste. He wanted to\nknow if he could come to England and meet u=\r\np for a day. So we did at\nOxford. It was he, and a few other physicists and=\r\n cosmologists who first\nasked me to write prose books. I said no thank you =\r\nvery much. I am not\neven a writer.  But they kept on and on so eventually I=\r\n did. And all\nhell broke lose, I knew it would :- )\n\n\n\nI am not a physicist=\r\n. I am a mystic. (their word not mine). From the age\nof three (now seventy =\r\ntwo) I had been having spontaneous mystical and\ntranscendent experiences. I=\r\n therefore started studying myself,\nconsciousness, depth psychology, and ot=\r\nher people and society. One of my\nmajor interest has always been politics (=\r\nalso music and chess). What I\nfound was/is amazing, and there is a lot of i=\r\nt. It leaves Carl Jung in\nKindergarten. But just one of the things which I =\r\nfound is that\nconsciousness works the same way as does physics, and specifi=\r\ncally found\nto be so in particle annihilation, symmetry breaking and symmet=\r\nry\nestablishment. Folks seem to forget that WE are a part of all this set\nu=\r\np. We are not something on the outside looking in. WE ARE IT. Along\nwith th=\r\nis the paradigm seems to teach them that we are `given&#39;\nlife. We are NOT gi=\r\nven life, WE ARE LIFE.\n\n\n\nAs to what can be proved of any of this by way of=\r\n scientific\ninvestigation and experiments I don&#39;t know, we will have to wai=\r\nt and\nsee. I am sceptical, but whilst always saying go for it, and see what=\r\n\ncan be discovered that way. It would be foolish not to. But I do steer\ncle=\r\nar of quasi religionists in scientific garb. One day some guy wrote\nto me a=\r\nnd said he had put me on his scientific god prize list (check it\nout for yo=\r\nurself -  http://www.godprize.org/ &lt;http://www.godprize.org/&gt; \n) without as=\r\nking my permission =96 most of the others are dead so they\ncannot argue bac=\r\nk. I would not have minded had it not been trying to\nsubstantiate jesus blo=\r\nody christ et al, and the Roman socio-political\nset up of two thousand year=\r\ns ago. When I asked to be taken of it they\nsuddenly became very angry, rude=\r\n and aggressive. I steer clear of\npriestcraft and their myrmidons of puppet=\r\ns that give them power. Along\nwith this I am aggressively active against In=\r\nternational Corporate\nMonopoly Capitalism. My idea of how politics ought to=\r\n be is so way out\nof the radar of existing ideas that I would place it some=\r\nwhere about two\nthousand years in the future.  When I was three I felt sure=\r\n that I had\nbeen born either on the wrong world or the right world at the w=\r\nrong\ntime. I still feel like that seventy years later :- )\n\n\n\nSo, I am not =\r\nthe most popular critter that ever walked the face of the\nglobe. Probably o=\r\nne of the most unpopular.  And like Plato said\n(although I do not agree wit=\r\nh what he said in most things) it is as\nthough they are living in some kind=\r\n of dark cave and taking shadows on\nthe wall as the reality.  So, there you=\r\n go :- )))) That is a brief\nsynopsis.\n\n\n\nWhy don&#39;t you get your people toge=\r\nther and start a chat group and\nthrash out an agreeable language for starte=\r\nrs. Everybody on this planet\nspeaks a different language. That is no damned=\r\n good. In the meantime the\nworld will not come right until people get thems=\r\nelves right first.\nMan&#39;s stupidities will not be eliminated until such time=\r\n that Man\ncomes into a better understanding of his mysterious consciousness=\r\n, and\nfrom whence it comes. The Mind and Consciousness of Man is ever tied =\r\nto\nthe cross of Time and Eternity.  This is not an hypothesis or a\nspeculat=\r\nion =96 IT IS SO and it is there to be found deep within us in\nthe very gro=\r\nund of our cognitive being, where Time cannot encroach upon\nits encompass. =\r\nBut you try telling them these things and you will be\nlaughed off the plane=\r\nt, as yet. Homo Ensophicus is coming. But not yet.\nThey do not want Homo En=\r\nsophicus here, for there is no profit in that.\nTell your countrymen these t=\r\nhings, for they are all dead over here.\n\n\n\nDick Richardson\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--5-6990313811-6673937662=:3\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;Good morning Mark&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot; style=3D&quot;text-align:justify;&quot;&gt;&lt;o&gt;&lt;/o&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;[ &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;col=\r\nor:navy;&quot;&gt;Dick,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family=\r\n: Verdana;font-size: 11px;color: rgb(0, 0, 128);&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:8.0pt;font-family:Verdana;color:n=\r\navy;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thanks for the\nviewing.
