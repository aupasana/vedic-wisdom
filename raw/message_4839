I am afraid it is a coded prayer. It contains hints in coded form for several specific sadhanas to get specific results using Devi Saptashati.\n \nFrom that point of view, one can understand why it says there is no siddhi without Kunjika stotra. However, one will almost certainly not get siddhi by merely chanting Kunjika stotra or adding it to one&#39;s Saptashati chanting. In fact, siddhi often comes to those who do not consciously pursue it.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf one says &quot;just spending time with your mother and expressing your love and respect for her will not give you her wealth. You need her checkbook to access her wealth&quot;, that is not incorrect. But that is not the complete story. Just by having the checkbook of one&#39;s mother, one may not be able to get her wealth. Check needs her signature. On the other hand, a simple child who does not consciously or explicitly try to get the wealth of one&#39;s mother and only spends time with mother expressing love and respect from her may end up getting her wealth when she decides by herself to give.\n \nIn fact, I suggest not being a son who looks to get mother&#39;s wealth by laying hands on her checkbook. Just cultivate love for mother and devote yourself to her. A mother knows what to give and when.\n \nJust chanting saptashati is quite useful.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- shashi_nambisan &lt;shashin@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Hi All,\n&gt;   I can see that there were some discussion on kunjika stotram before\n&gt; however can someone who has expertise in sanskrit give exact meaning \n&gt; of these snippets\n&gt; \n&gt; These are snippets from two slokas in Siddha Kunjika Stotram.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.
