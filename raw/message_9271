He too said there=\r\n are innumerable avataras. Avataras can come with a combination of paramatm=\r\namsas (supreme/absolute being portions) and jivatmamsas (living/relative be=\r\ning portions) taken from grahas in any combination. Though 9 main avataras =\r\nof Vishnu came from paramatmamsas of 9 grahas, many many other avataras als=\r\no descended on earth due to various other combinations of paramatmamsas and=\r\n jivatmamsas of the same 9 grahas! There are obviously many possibilities.\n=\r\n=A0\nIn fact, Parasara says that ALL beings contain some paramatmamsa and so=\r\nme jivatmamsa, coming from grahas. But jivatmamsa is predominant in most of=\r\n us.\n=A0\nWhen one leaves earth, paramatmamsas in one return to respective g=\r\nrahas and jivatmamsas take birth again based on desires. In the &#39;end&#39;, even=\r\n the jivatmamsas return to respective grahas. At the time of Mahapralaya, g=\r\nrahas also merge back in Supreme Lord.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nAs for Kalki, Parasara did not clarify and we can onl=\r\ny speculate. Though some people associate him with lagna, that makes no sen=\r\nse to me either. That is inconsistent with the overall framework laid by Pa=\r\nrasara (i.e. beings born with combinations of paramatmamsas and jivatmamsas=\r\n from *grahas*).\n=A0\nKalki will probably come with paramatmamsas of both Su=\r\nn and Moon. After all, Kalki shows Shiva and Shakti (Sun and Moon - soul an=\r\nd mind) coming together finally!! Just a speculation..\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nWhether you take 9 or 10 or 22 avataras=\r\n, the theory of evolutionary spiritual perfection does not add up because &quot;=\r\nperfection&quot; occurred before the last avatara, unless you break away from ma=\r\nin scriptures and throw away Buddha (and discount Kalki as he has not come =\r\nyet).\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nRather than &quot;=\r\nevolution&quot;, it is a matter of what the world needs at that time. If people =\r\nat the beginning of Satya yuga are established in Self always and the only =\r\nissue is that a small attachment may develop now and then, disturbing that =\r\nstate of being established in Self (i.e. stealing of Veda!), then the aspec=\r\nt of consciousness that is relevant is &quot;spirit of detachment&quot; (Ketu). If in=\r\nvoked, it removes that attachment and takes one back to being established i=\r\nn Self. So an avatara corresponding to Ketu occurred.\n=A0\nAs collective con=\r\nsciousness became denser, being established in Self became less natural and=\r\n more effort was needed. So the &quot;spirit of patience, persistence and hard-w=\r\nork&quot; (Saturn) became relevant and an avatara corresponding to Saturn occurr=\r\ned. And so on.\n=A0\nIn the dark ages of Kali yuga, rational minds wouldn&#39;t a=\r\nccept anything that didn&#39;t &quot;make sense&quot;. Being established in Self became a=\r\nn unnatural, ridiculous and incomprehensible notion. So the &quot;spirit of comp=\r\nrehension&quot; (Mercury) became relevant. An avatara corresponding to Mercury o=\r\nccurred and tried to explain being established in Self as a comprehensible =\r\nnotion, so that rational minds of that age would accept it to an extent and=\r\n attempt it.\n=A0\nAvataras occur based on the needs of collective consciousn=\r\ness. Of course, if one&#39;s consciousness is in a different state from the col=\r\nlective consciousness of that time, the current avatara may not be relevant=\r\n to one.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\n&gt; I respec=\r\nt Rama, but I worship Krshna.\n=A0\nI am awestruck by Krishna and worship him=\r\n, but I see Rama as an ideal that I MAY be able to emulate oneday. In fact,=\r\n I recommend the approach to others.\n=A0\nThough I said Rama and Krishna are=\r\n almost the same, there is a difference between soul and perfected mind. So=\r\nul is a spark of Shiva and a perfected mind is a spark of Chit Shakti (wher=\r\neas an imperfect mind is a spark of Maya shakti).\n=A0\n\nBest regards,\nNarasi=\r\nmha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org\n--------\n=A0\n\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy=\r\n &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;Sent: Sunday, May 5, 2013 3:34 AM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-=\r\nwisdom] Re: Comparing Dasavataras!\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt;Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Jai =\r\nMa!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Just to clarify, I may have a special liking for Krshna, but my ai=\r\nm is obvious not to demean Rama, or any other special form of God.=A0Just c=\r\nlarifying incase someone gets the wrong impression.

It lists 22 Avataras! It=A0deals with the idea of =\r\nAvataran, but not with the idea of 9/10 fixed Avataras.=A0It also=A0lists V=\r\naraha Avatara as the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya as the 10 in its list of 22. I=\r\nt is only in other puranas, that we get the focus on 10 Avatars, and the te=\r\nrm becomes popular. \n&gt;=A0\n&gt;And ONLY when we take these 9/10 Avataras, in a =\r\nfixed sequence=A0of appearence, that we get the popular concept of Dasavata=\r\nra. Else no. I find the evolutionary link in this concept of 9/10 Avataras =\r\ntoo compelling to be ignored.=A0=A0\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;&lt;&lt;After all, &quot;entire divinity&quot; ca=\r\nnnot be encapsulated by any form&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;This, I am in total agreement with.=\r\n Infact, in the 10th Chapter of Gita when the Supreme explains the various =\r\nvibhutis, this One is not even Krshna, but has transcended every limitation=\r\n of conception. Hence, the One says, among those who weild weapons, it is R=\r\nama, and among the Vrishnis it is Krshna! Etc..\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;&lt;&lt;First, he IS mentio=\r\nned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot;=\r\n in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wr=\r\nong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;As I =\r\nsaid, the SB list contains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on the idea of 9/=\r\n10 Avataras! That is my point. If you take 22 Avataras, then these link to =\r\ngrahas are not of any use. For these nine grahas, individually or in combin=\r\nation, will represent all Avataras, or for that matter everything else in t=\r\nhis Universe.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Secondly, if we take 10 Avatars and corresponding graha=\r\ns for each, then what must Kalki be? Lagna? But=A0lagna is not a graha.\n&gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt;Or, just surmising, can it be possible that until an Avatara actually =\r\ndescends on the earth, his energy and his force cannot be attributed to any=\r\n graha, but once he does appear, it reconfigures things completely? We can =\r\nonly know after the last Avatara comes.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Anyway, I am not looking at t=\r\nhis main Avatars from the point of grahas/jyotish at all. For that matter, =\r\nsome traditions consider Balarama to be an Avatara rather than Buddha.\n&gt;=A0=\r\n\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;The concept of Avatara and Vibhutis comes from the Gita. These two a=\r\nre slightly different. Avatara is a special descent of God, Paramatma, whic=\r\nh appears on this world=A0during times of severe crisis to=A0cause a drasti=\r\nc and fundamental=A0transition. A Vibhuti is a limited force of God which c=\r\nan appear to help out, directly or indirectly, in any transition. A Vibuti =\r\nneed not be spiritual. It could be in any field of work.=A0Sometimes a Vibh=\r\nuti may not even be aware of its purpose, unlike an Avatara.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Basicall=\r\ny, whenever we see excellence in any form, in any field, it is always the e=\r\nnergy of the One at work..\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;-Regards\n&gt;=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;awaktam wyaktim=\r\nApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||=\r\n[7:24]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;From: Narasimha P.V.R.

More importantly, if your understanding is correct, w=\r\nhy isn&#39;t perfection occurring in the FINAL incarnation but occurring well b=\r\nefore?\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;First, r=\r\negarding Krishna being a &quot;poornavatara&quot;, SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not say=\r\n that Rama is not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly menti=\r\noned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poornavataras&quot; (used tha=\r\nt exact expression) while other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa too=\r\n\n (though paramatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Secondly, after describ=\r\ning the avataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable avataras and t=\r\nhat all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It=\r\n is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say &quot;these avataras are=\r\n partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I question if the deduction that =\r\nKrishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only seems =\r\nto say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I said ab=\r\nove, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poornavataras=\r\n.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Third, let us ask a very fundamental question: What exactly does it=\r\n mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;While SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1=\r\n.3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is in reality\n f=\r\normless (arUpa) and of the nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are ma=\r\nnufactured by the qualities of Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it further compare=\r\ns forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* cl=\r\nouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them=\r\n. So, again, what is the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth=\r\n being &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notio=\r\nn based on their fancies and conditioning..\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;All beings are made up of=\r\n paramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). Th=\r\ne latter portion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and rebir=\r\nth. Great avataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely =\r\navataras descend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama =\r\nand Krishna are specific examples given by Parasara.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;They are entirel=\r\ny divine, but they do not encapsulate the entire\n divinity!!!! After all, &quot;=\r\nentire divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can co=\r\nntain the entire sky. They take part in the drama obeying and executing the=\r\n divine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.\n=\r\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt; Buddha was gr=\r\neat spiritual force in this world. But I do not\n&gt;&gt; see him fit in the schem=\r\ne of evolutionary Avatars. His\n&gt;&gt; realization, the one he advocated, is a s=\r\ntatic realization,\n&gt;&gt; an end in a void.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;First, he IS mentioned in SB =\r\nlist of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;=\r\nscheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and av=\r\nataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Secondly, as p=\r\ner Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies logical mind an=\r\nd the spirit of investigation\n and comprehension. Logical mind and its spir=\r\nit of comprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit of com=\r\nprehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for =\r\nit is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensibl=\r\ne in an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However,=\r\n logical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No=\r\n wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this world in this=\r\n age.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;If you di=\r\nsmiss Parasara&#39;s linking of planets to avataras as a possible corruption, a=\r\nre you absolutely sure that the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect=\r\n? (In any case, it&#39;s a different matter that you are only taking some SB\n v=\r\nerses and ignoring some as I showed!.)\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;The bottomline as far as I am =\r\nconcerned is that Pararsara&#39;s list actually makes amazingly coherent esoter=\r\nic sense. The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit =\r\nof comprehension, Saturn - spirit of patience & persistence, Venus - spirit=\r\n of happiness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara DOES have a highl=\r\ny meaningful connection, esoterically speaking. After all, esoterically is =\r\nhow you really need to understand any higher scriptures and notions in them=\r\n.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;If we take scriptures literally instead and draw lopsided conclusio=\r\nns, some would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities a=\r\nre &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and othe=\r\nr deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;On a different note, someone may think that\n Kali, =\r\nbeing Aadyaa, is superior to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned yog=\r\nis have declared them to be essentially the same and some scriptures even p=\r\nrohibited differentiating between them. As I see it, the difference between=\r\n them is too subtle for even rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing so=\r\nme significant difference between them are, I am afraid, merely projecting =\r\ntheir own conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama.

Let me write down as I see it, in point by point manner.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;1. In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In t=\r\nhis list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th A=\r\nvatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and =\r\nthen the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are =\r\ninnumerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerab=\r\nle others, are amsas of the Supreme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;2. Of these various possible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I belie=\r\nve, are/have been accorded special mention and significance across various =\r\nHindu spiritual literature, specially those which were composed in the Kali=\r\n-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his =\r\nphysical presence had curtailed the full effect of Kali,once he left his bo=\r\ndy, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas were composed after this, hence =\r\nthese are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;3. These 10/=\r\n9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Nara=\r\nsimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an u=\r\nnmistakeable connection of the form and sequence of these main avatars with=\r\n the evolution of life on earth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the=\r\n land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human li=\r\nfe form who immediately takes possession of this earth represented by Vaman=\r\na&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an =\r\naxe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. =\r\nAlso, this indicates that spirituality is not to be separated into another =\r\nworld, but is a progressive realization of the various manifestation and po=\r\ntentials that lie inherent in the consciousness and its development through=\r\n various life-forms. Larger spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in =\r\nhand. That is Nature&#39;s grand design for life on earth.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;4. In this s=\r\npecifc context, I am only focusing on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatar=\r\ns. It is not my contention that if one worships say Matysa Avatara, one wil=\r\nl not attain to a state of liberation of the soul. As is the nature of spir=\r\nitual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a person to any depth of r=\r\nealization. And each one of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-realized in thei=\r\nr own way and can be consider super-massive spiritual dynamos.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they rep=\r\nresent a stage of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which society =\r\ncan relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage =\r\nof most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to=\r\n transform the animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a cons=\r\ntructive force for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Satt=\r\nwa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is s=\r\ntatic in nature and will change only when circumstances force it to. As per=\r\n the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in t=\r\nhe forest. He did have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, w=\r\nhich was dispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun=\r\n to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispas=\r\nsionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it was\n the Dh=\r\narma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma of =\r\nthat age when he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic, an=\r\nd I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things =\r\nas they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own=\r\n preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced=\r\n which culminated into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispass=\r\nionate leader, such that no personal consideration or emotions or passions =\r\ncan overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader mus=\r\nt be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I am n=\r\not taking his=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singular and co=\r\nnstant detachment from situations, from people, from environment, from circ=\r\numstances that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrin=\r\ndavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents, his\n village-folks=\r\n who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for him to =\r\nleave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village life and =\r\nhead into an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with t=\r\nhem, then he understood that they won&#39;t understand, he promised he will ret=\r\nurn back once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much l=\r\nater, when the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their dance, =\r\nhe obliged. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and possess=\r\nive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying that he be=\r\nlongs to everyone equally and no one has any special right over him. When S=\r\nhishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floo=\r\nr, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cu=\r\nt off Shishupala&#39;s head and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava u=\r\nnfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist and\n charlatan, Krshna did =\r\nnot kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black=\r\n magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the as=\r\nsembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very next momen=\r\nt he was back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is t=\r\nhere one instance of his going overboard, never a single shade of depressio=\r\nn, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what=\r\n others say or think of him. And then right in the middle of the greatest w=\r\nar he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philo=\r\nsophy. That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a tru=\r\ne Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither=\r\n the action nor the results belong to the instrument. When running away fro=\r\nm the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to te=\r\nar apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema to\n hit Duryodhana below the waist=\r\n, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuiti=\r\non, knew exactly how the situations must be lined up which would cause the =\r\ndestruction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rati=\r\nonal thinking. But happens when one is constantly and consciously connected=\r\n to the Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situations in=\r\n the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take =\r\nthe Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a =\r\ndifferent picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon atta=\r\ncking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and =\r\ndemolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only=\r\n the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is very clear. =\r\nRama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great=\r\n characteristics of satwa, chief of\n which is self-control, as well as the =\r\noccasional sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at lea=\r\nst until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a t=\r\nrue saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krsh=\r\nna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this world - man, wome=\r\nn, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affected any tr=\r\nace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the most trying =\r\nsituations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not=\r\n see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, the on=\r\ne he advocated, is a static realization, an end in a void. This is clearly =\r\ndenying of the reality of this earth. I find this not in tune with what eit=\r\nher Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them negated this world. If negation o=\r\nf this world and life is the final aim, then why send so many avatars at cr=\r\nucial stages of evolutionary\n development? If the spiritual impact on masse=\r\ns is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathru=\r\nsta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But do they fit in the sche=\r\nme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a most l=\r\nogical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in parts of India, do =\r\nnot consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and holis=\r\ntic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of life as well as inside of =\r\nlife. That is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual philosophy=\r\n, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence and r=\r\nealization. 7. The original literature of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 =\r\nchakras. These are centers of psychological functions. 6 inside the human b=\r\nody and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most people, even seekers. It is =\r\nmy belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond to th=\r\ne full power and force\n of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas,=\r\n or that which can modify consciousness or allow the consciousness to explo=\r\nre and express itself is various possiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna i=\r\ns a reference point and not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who repres=\r\nent the parable of evolution are nine in number. And the ninth of the seque=\r\nnce is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment on which graha would typically repr=\r\nesent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says, however, it is my belief=\r\n - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted c=\r\norruption of understanding or textual misrepresentation in this Kali-Yuga] =\r\n- that the Atmah among the Avataras has not yet appeared. It will be Kalki,=\r\n or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka - the stai=\r\nnless one. There is only one thing which is perfectly stainless, the Atmah =\r\n.After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in the full and complete pur=\r\nity and might\n and force and strength of the Atmah. By the sheer dint of hi=\r\ns purity the last Avatara will burn away opposing forces of this world and =\r\nfulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna used diplomacy at various poi=\r\nnts in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating, won&#39;t e=\r\nven need that. The white horse and that sword is a metaphor. He will be the=\r\n only one capable enough to rectify the various errors and corruptions that=\r\n beset our age. Well, this is how I look at the story of Avataras. It is pe=\r\nrfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I am reasonably sanguine now tha=\r\nt this is what is closer to truth. -Regards =A0Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;awaktam wya=\r\nktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttama=\r\nm ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;From: Narasimha P.V.R.

A learned friend wrote that &quot;Krshna is t=\r\nhe God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stage&quot; and &quot;Buddha af=\r\nter Krshna is like going back from the linear progression of spirituality t=\r\nhat the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshna&quot;. =A0 I want to em=\r\nphatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a &quot;linear progressi=\r\non of spirituality..upto Krshna&quot;. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Each avatara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfected=\r\n form. =A0 Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with planets. For example,=\r\n Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively. =A0 We a=\r\nlso know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ke=\r\ntu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning sp=\r\nirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/disc=\r\nipline,\n spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detachment (respectivel=\r\ny). =A0 Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of that aspect of Su=\r\npreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how that aspect oper=\r\nates. =A0 Lord Rama&#39;s story is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lo=\r\nrd Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana=\r\n&#39;s story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord=\r\n Narasimha&#39;s story is a perfected example of how energy/drive/initiative op=\r\nerates. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Now, let us=\r\n remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy in us, learning s=\r\npirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - all=\r\n these are different manifestations of the same Self. However, when Self ma=\r\nnifests as these different aspects, it has different qualities and plays di=\r\nfferent roles. There is no comparison between them. =A0 We MAY focus on one=\r\n aspect of us first,\n perfect it and then perfect other aspects through it.=\r\n But, we need balance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, these diff=\r\nerent aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable and are in a balance workin=\r\ng together in the Cosmos. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n * =A0 One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may like the story th=\r\nat demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualities o=\r\nf mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates, and one who =\r\nis fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story that demonstrat=\r\nes how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste and s=\r\nubjective preference. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =\r\n=A0 Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a=\r\n representative of god in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It is=\r\n the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes. =A0 Once mind fa=\r\nncies a separate existence with some\n agendas/desires, soul supports the in=\r\ndividualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dhar=\r\nma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this individualized co=\r\nnsciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, dis=\r\ncipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/d=\r\nislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and records all of one&#39;s ag=\r\nendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It doe=\r\ns all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor=\r\n receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individualized cons=\r\nciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things and begetting the=\r\n fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma =\r\nand does it impassionately. =A0 Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not =\r\nto all. This functionality of an impassionate witness supporting the play, =\r\nmay not seem interesting enough\n to some. =A0 On the other hand, mind has l=\r\nikes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, gettin=\r\ng things and achieving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individua=\r\nlization going!!! Though soul is the support for everything else in the ind=\r\nividualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionatel=\r\ny. It is mind that keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas =\r\nand passion and even decides/affects every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, mind =\r\nis really the &quot;boss&quot; of the individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life app=\r\neals more to one who may be excited by this description! =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Lord Krishna is obviously awe-inspir=\r\ning, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in perspective. =A0 Rama&#39;s life demonstrate=\r\ns how soul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasishth=\r\na and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vis=\r\nhwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given\n kingdom. At the last moment, h=\r\nis father banished him to forest at the behest of his step-mother and his s=\r\ntep-brother was given the throne. He had no complaints. Though his father, =\r\nstep-mother and step-brother felt guilty to various degrees, he himself sup=\r\nported and consoled all three and followed his dharma impassionately. Thoug=\r\nh he knew leaving Sita in the forest with Lakshmana and going after the gol=\r\nden deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately when Sita insisted.=\r\n When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the battl=\r\ne. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshmana =\r\nfor leaving her later. He accepted every life situation with no complaints =\r\nand did the best possible action then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did so =\r\nwithout hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana was=\r\n dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some subjects that were goi=\r\nng to disappear with Ravana! =A0 Rama\n is a perfect example of a liberated =\r\nman with no desires or agendas who impassionately discharges one&#39;s dharma a=\r\nrising from the momentum of karmas before liberation. THAT is basically wha=\r\nt soul does! =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 As ano=\r\nther example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstra=\r\ntion of how wisdom/discrimination operates. =A0 He was born as a learned py=\r\ngmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king wi=\r\nth many great qualities. =A0 Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and una=\r\nssuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.=\r\ng. pride or attachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not pleased until that pri=\r\nde is suppressed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, then demoni=\r\nc qualities are completely suppressed. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Please think about the other avataras. The stories ca=\r\nn be understood as perfect demonstrations of how various aspects of\n our co=\r\nnsciousness operate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara. =A0 Let us not =\r\ncompare Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if y=\r\nou are more attracted to one of them, please think about that avatara more =\r\nand develop devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara. =\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 By the way, happy H=\r\nanumajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are different schools =\r\nof thought). =A0 Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology & Spirituality =\r\nResources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org -------- \n&gt;\r\n---1593584224-1423912939-1367774993=:68258\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Rajarshi,&lt;br&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;Even Parasara did not say there are just 9 or 10 avataras or that th=\r\nere is a one-to-one correspondence to grahas. He too said there are innumer=\r\nable avataras. Avataras can come with a combination of paramatmamsas (supre=\r\nme/absolute being portions) and jivatmamsas (living/relative being portions=\r\n) taken from grahas in any combination. Though 9 main avataras of Vishnu ca=\r\nme from paramatmamsas of 9 grahas, many many other avataras also descended =\r\non earth due to various other combinations of paramatmamsas and jivatmamsas=\r\n of the same 9 grahas! There are obviously many possibilities.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;In fact, Parasara says that ALL beings contain some paramatmamsa and some =\r\njivatmamsa, coming from grahas. But jivatmamsa is predominant in most of us=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When one leaves earth, paramatmamsas in one return to\n respe=\r\nctive grahas and jivatmamsas take birth again based on desires. In the &#39;end=\r\n&#39;, even the jivatmamsas return to respective grahas. At the time of Mahapra=\r\nlaya, grahas also merge back in Supreme Lord.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As for Kalki, Parasara did not clarify and we can only speculat=\r\ne. Though some people associate him with lagna, that makes no sense to me e=\r\nither. That is inconsistent with the overall framework laid by Parasara (i.=\r\ne. beings born with combinations of paramatmamsas and jivatmamsas from *gra=\r\nhas*).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Kalki will probably come with paramatmamsas of both Sun=\r\n and Moon. After all, Kalki shows Shiva and Shakti (Sun and Moon - soul and=\r\n mind) coming together finally!! Just a speculation..&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Whether you take 9 or 10 or 22 avataras,\n the theory of=\r\n evolutionary spiritual perfection does not add up because &quot;perfection&quot; occ=\r\nurred before the last avatara, unless you break away from main scriptures a=\r\nnd throw away Buddha (and discount Kalki as he has not come yet).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Rather than &quot;evolution&quot;, it is a matter of =\r\nwhat the world needs at that time. If people at the beginning of Satya yuga=\r\n are established in Self always and the only issue is that a small attachme=\r\nnt may develop now and then, disturbing that state of being established in =\r\nSelf (i.e. stealing of Veda!), then the aspect of consciousness that is rel=\r\nevant is &quot;spirit of detachment&quot; (Ketu). If invoked, it removes that attachm=\r\nent and takes one back to being established in Self. So an avatara correspo=\r\nnding to Ketu occurred.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As collective consciousness became den=\r\nser, being established in Self became less natural and\n more effort was nee=\r\nded. So the &quot;spirit of patience, persistence and hard-work&quot; (Saturn) became=\r\n relevant and an avatara corresponding to Saturn occurred. And so on.&lt;br&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In the dark ages of Kali yuga, rational minds wouldn&#39;t accept anyth=\r\ning that didn&#39;t &quot;make sense&quot;. Being established in Self became an unnatural=\r\n, ridiculous and incomprehensible notion. So the &quot;spirit of comprehension&quot; =\r\n(Mercury) became relevant. An avatara corresponding to Mercury occurred and=\r\n tried to explain being established in Self as a comprehensible notion, so =\r\nthat rational minds of that age would accept it to an extent and attempt it=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Avataras occur based on the needs of collective consciousnes=\r\ns. Of course, if one&#39;s consciousness is in a different state from the colle=\r\nctive consciousness of that time, the current avatara may not be relevant t=\r\no one.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; I respect Rama, but I=\r\n worship Krshna.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I am awestruck by Krishna and worship him, bu=\r\nt I see Rama as an ideal that I MAY be able to emulate oneday.

That is my point. If you t=\r\nake 22 Avataras, then these link to grahas are not of any use.

More impo=\r\nrtantly, if your understanding is correct, why isn&#39;t perfection occurring i=\r\nn the FINAL incarnation but occurring well before?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;First, regarding Krishna being a &quot;poornavatara&quot;, SrimadBha=\r\ngavatam (SB) does not say that Rama is not one. In fact, Parasara, father o=\r\nf Vyasa, explicitly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are =\r\n&quot;poornavataras&quot; (used that exact expression) while other avataras have some=\r\n amount of jivatmamsa too\n (though paramatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).&lt;br&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, after describing the avataras, SB says that there are in=\r\n fact innumerable avataras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc =\r\nare avataras of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then pro=\r\nceeds to say &quot;these avataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I=\r\n question if the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is=\r\n not is accurate! It only seems to say that all these rishis, manus, demigo=\r\nds etc are partial. As I said above, Pararsara explicitly said that both Ra=\r\nma and Krishna are poornavataras.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Third, let us ask a very fun=\r\ndamental question: What exactly does it mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself=\r\n&quot;?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;While SB talks of Krishna being=\r\n &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, =\r\nwho is in reality\n formless (arUpa) and of the nature of pure consciousness=\r\n (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualities of Maya&quot;. In the next verse=\r\n, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just =\r\nas sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* form=\r\ns and is beyond them. So, again, what is the meaning of a specific form tha=\r\nt descended on earth being &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I am afraid people may be misint=\r\nerpreting this notion based on their fancies and conditioning..&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;All beings are made up of paramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma =\r\n(living/relative being). The latter portion is dominant in us and is respon=\r\nsible for desires and rebirth. Great avataras descend from a higher portion=\r\n of paramatma. Very rarely avataras descend entirely from paramatma without=\r\n ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna are specific examples given by Paras=\r\nara.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;They are entirely divine, but they do not encapsulate the=\r\n entire\n divinity!!!! After all, &quot;entire divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated b=\r\ny any form just as no cloud can contain the entire sky. They take part in t=\r\nhe drama obeying and executing the divine will but NOT altering it. This ap=\r\nplies to Krishna as well as Rama.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not&lt;br&gt;&gt; s=\r\nee him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His&lt;br&gt;&gt; realization, =\r\nthe one he advocated, is a static realization,&lt;br&gt;&gt; an end in a void.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;First, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasar=\r\na&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, th=\r\nen your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionar=\r\ny&quot; as you theorize.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, as per Parasara, Buddha correspo=\r\nnds to Mercury, who personifies logical mind and the spirit of investigatio=\r\nn\n and comprehension. Logical mind and its &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789=\r\nyui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_13670=\r\n25215463_151&quot;&gt;spirit of comprehension are &lt;/span&gt;inherently fallible. Even =\r\na perfected spirit of comprehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute=\r\n Reality completely, for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simpl=\r\nifies the Incomprehensible in an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha=\r\n ended up doing. However, logical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Rea=\r\nson in this Kali yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual fo=\r\nrce in this world in this age.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If =\r\nyou dismiss Parasara&#39;s linking of planets to avataras as a possible corrupt=\r\nion, are you absolutely sure that the verses of SB you are relying on are p=\r\nerfect? (In any case, it&#39;s a different matter that you are only taking\n som=\r\ne SB\n verses and ignoring some as I showed!.)&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The bottomline a=\r\ns far as I am concerned is that Pararsara&#39;s list actually makes amazingly c=\r\noherent esoteric sense. The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Bu=\r\nddha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit of patience &amp; persisten=\r\nce, Venus - spirit of happiness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara=\r\n DOES have a highly meaningful connection, esoterically speaking. After all=\r\n, esoterically is how you really need to understand any higher scriptures a=\r\nnd notions in them.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If we take scriptures literally instead an=\r\nd draw lopsided conclusions, some would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme=\r\n&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is t=\r\nhe &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;On a different note, someone may think that\n Ka=\r\nli, being Aadyaa, is superior to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned=\r\n yogis have declared them to be essentially the same and some scriptures ev=\r\nen prohibited differentiating between them. As I see it, the difference bet=\r\nween them is too subtle for even rishis to clearly comprehend. People seein=\r\ng some significant difference between them are, I am afraid, merely project=\r\ning their own conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were=\r\n&nbsp; perfectly detached and fully divine karma yogis.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If we =\r\nthink about it, perfected mind (paramatma &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789y=\r\nui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_136702=\r\n5215463_151&quot;&gt;aspect represented by &lt;/span&gt;Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect =\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D=\r\n&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_=\r\n3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&quot;&gt;represented by &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Sun) are not\n real=\r\nly that\n different. So I am afraid Krishna and Rama are not that different,=\r\n though the specifics of their stories may be different.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One l=\r\nast word though. If someone truly believes that Krishna is superior to Rama=\r\n and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I am very happy for such a person. =\r\nMy arguments are more for the sake of sharing thinking/knowledge and pushin=\r\ng the boundaries of understanding in the long run, than changing the minds =\r\nof anyone in the short run. In the end, everyone of us will have to go thro=\r\nugh one&#39;s own cycles of various tamasik, rajasik and saattwik stages of evo=\r\nlution before one starts grasping some fistfuls of Reality. These concepts =\r\nare too subtle for anyone to convince others or be absolutely confident one=\r\nself!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;FON=\r\nT-STYLE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,=\r\n0,0);FONT-SIZE:13px;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_59&quot; cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_58&quot;&gt;Krishnarpanamastu, Narasi=\r\nmha -------- Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.vedicas=\r\ntrologer.org/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:transparent;FONT-STY=\r\nLE:normal;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;COLOR:rgb(0,0,0);=\r\nFONT-SIZE:13px;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_61&quot; class=3D=\r\n&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_60&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;=\r\nyiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_171&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789y=\r\nui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_63&quot;&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT:rgb(16,16,2=\r\n55) 2px solid;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_66&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;FONT-SIZE:10pt;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv10=\r\n51733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_180&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_=\r\n1367025215463_70&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, tim=\r\nes, serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_17=\r\n9&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_71&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; i=\r\nd=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_178&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOT=\r\nTOM:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-LEFT:#ccc 1px solid;HEIGHT:0px;FONT-SIZE:0px;BORD=\r\nER-TOP:#ccc 1px solid;BORDER-RIGHT:#ccc 1px solid;&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1051733789h=\r\nr&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_177&quot; face=3D&quot;A=\r\nrial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_176&quot;&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463=\r\n_175&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b =\r\nid=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_215&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIG=\r\nHT:bold;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_214&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;=\r\n &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, May 4, 2013 7=\r\n:34 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom]\n Comparing Dasavataras!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv105173378=\r\n9yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_192&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv1051733789y_msg_container&quot;&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789yui_3_7_2_64_136702521=\r\n5463_191&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1051733789ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div sty=\r\nle=3D\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
