Further, one may=\r\n use the same term to mean something else and keep needlessly arguing over =\r\na non issue. Precise, clear definitions are the first step in a meaningful =\r\ndialogue.\n\n\nHere is the relevant Text:\n\n&quot;....Ajna and mooladhara chakras ar=\r\ne closely related, and the awakening of one helps to awaken the other. Idea=\r\nlly, ajna should be awakened to some extent before mooladhara, in order to =\r\nallow an unaffected perception of the energies manifested by mooladhara and=\r\n the lower chakras. However, the awakening of mooladhara will help to furth=\r\ner awaken ajna. In fact, the best way to bring about awakening of ajna is t=\r\nhrough the practices of moola bandha and ashwini mudra which are specific f=\r\nor mooladhara.. ..&quot;\n\nWell, thanks for the quote. However, this does not say=\r\n that &quot;awakening&quot; of one will automatically &quot;awaken&quot; the other. It says, in=\r\n an ideal case one should &quot;awaken&quot; Agya chakra to some extent before trying=\r\n to awaken Mooladhara chakra. \n=C2=A0\nIn a lot of people chakras remain &quot;aw=\r\nakened in various degrees&quot;without any conscinous effort. Rarely would an in=\r\ndividual appear who have absolutely zero awakening of all chakras. In most =\r\ncases, &quot;partially awakenend&quot; chakras do exist, but I am not sure if that is=\r\n of any significant help in practical spirituality.\n=C2=A0\nPlus, this is on=\r\ne of the possible paths of progess in Yoga, not the only one possible. Henc=\r\ne, we should not jump to conclusions which are not explicitly stated. \n=C2=\r\n=A0\nA fact, required to understand why Ganesh, deity of Mooladhara, is wors=\r\nhipped first.\n=C2=A0\n\nGanesha is worshipped first because it presides over =\r\nthe Mooladhara, not because mooladhara has a connection with Agya. \n=C2=A0\n=\r\nRegarding the 6th tattwa there is nothing new to it, it already exists, Yog=\r\nananda writes in his commentary the following:\n\n&quot;...Beyond the subtlest phy=\r\nsical vibration (akasha, ether), Paramahansa Yogananda explained, is the su=\r\nperether,&quot; a finer manifestation and therefore not classified as one of the=\r\n physical vibratory elements (tattvas), of which there are only five-earth,=\r\n water, fire, air, ether. Some yoga treatises define this tattwa as mind, o=\r\nr &#39;non-matter&#39; , as opposed to matter or gross vibration... .&quot;\n\nI am sorry,=\r\n but the above quote is a little vague. It no where mentions that Chitta is=\r\n a 6th tattwa. What it does it says about the 5 gross elements and &quot;a finer=\r\n manifestation&quot;. Maybe the intented audience for this passage was one who i=\r\ns not intellectually aware of the basic=C2=A0idea of five creative elements=\r\n. Otherwise, the &quot;super-ether&quot; needs more clarity. Is it prakiriti? It is C=\r\nhitta? Is it really sixth or does the six have more subsets? Is he calling =\r\nit a vague six because we cannot be aware of the higher tattwas beyond the =\r\nfive, therefore clubbing everything together into one?\n=C2=A0\nAs you mentio=\r\nned Samkhya, it uses a calssification of the universe in 24 tattwas with 5 =\r\nwhich cause physical manifestations to occur. It is still not 6 by any meas=\r\nure.\n=C2=A0\nAgain in Kasmiri Shaivism, they define 36 tattwas! That is why =\r\nthe need to be technically precise so that we may not misunderstand each ot=\r\nher.\n=C2=A0\n&gt; The tattwas are 5 in number as per multiple Hindu scriptures,=\r\n both &gt; Agamas/Nigamas as well as Upanishads.\n\nWhich scriptures ? Quotes ? =\r\n\n=C2=A0\nCheck the quotation given by Sundeep right at the begining of this =\r\nset of mails. Are you questioning the veracity of scriptures or the fact th=\r\nat they mention creation is caused by five gross elements?\n\n\nIt is through =\r\nSankhya, that you can understand why Chitta is related to it. \n=C2=A0\nAs I =\r\nsaid before, no one is denying the existence of Chitta. One is however ques=\r\ntioning whether Chitta is a &#39;6th element&#39; . If you take Samkhya, there are =\r\n24 elements, of which 5 are basic. And the rest are subtle. So when normal =\r\ncreation is spoken of, it is spoken off in terms of 5 elements and not 6. W=\r\nhen the essence of spirituality is spoken off right upto the state of God, =\r\nthen we go into 24 or 36 (depending on your classification). Further, in th=\r\ne 36 element lists, the &quot;suddha-tattwas&quot; are defined as unknowable from thi=\r\ns plane of existence. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nAs Narasimha knows Jyotish shastra als=\r\no, he could probably figure out the rashi to which the 6th tattwa is attrib=\r\nuted since I have already given the table out, so it is as real as it rises=\r\n daily.\n\nUmm, with due respect, no it is not yet easy.

The five chakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra=\r\n to Moolaadhaara chakra represent ether, air, fire, water and earth. When K=\r\nundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, earth element within one is surrendered, i.e.=\r\n all traces of earth element are effaced in one&#39;s self-awareness.

For example, a=\r\nn idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, som=\r\ne knowledge etc) is of solid state and made of earth element. An idea that =\r\none &quot;needs&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge=\r\n etc) is of the nature of water element. Thus, different mental concepts an=\r\nd ideas can be mapped to the five elements.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one think=\r\ns of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a body that looks and feels in a particular=\r\n way physically. Apart from the physical aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as so=\r\nmeone who has certain qualities, certain needs, certain belongings etc. All=\r\n those concepts one has about who one is, form one&#39;s self-awareness and Kun=\r\ndalini represents that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara =\r\nchakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative ide=\r\na of who one is is still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana =\r\nchakra, if *anything* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cum=\r\nulative idea of who one is is still remaining. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nMany people who talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are o=\r\nften talking merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (w=\r\nhich may still be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini a=\r\nctually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not =\r\nperceive a solid body, one will not have notions of owning anything. Simila=\r\nrly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one&#39;s cu=\r\nmulative idea of who one is, at the physical as well as the subtle level of=\r\n existence! To completely efface even one element (earth) from one&#39;s notion=\r\n of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The order in which elements are effaced as one progresses towa=\r\nrds samadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again come=\r\ns down, effaced elements return to work in the reverse order - ether, air, =\r\nfire, water and earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding ph=\r\nysics and spiritual realities:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does physics describe rea=\r\nlity?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries to describe/model reality at the gross=\r\n physical level, as perceived by the external senses. However, one&#39;s mind c=\r\nan &quot;perceive&quot; things without the external senses playing a role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; As a simple example, one may be asleep and get a dream, in which one=\r\n&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between them. In an=\r\nother example, a yogi may be meditating with a mantra with intense focus an=\r\nd &quot;see&quot; some scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot be perce=\r\nived by the external senses and hence cannot be studied by modern science.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define reality as something that can b=\r\ne perceived by the external senses, because different people can experience=\r\n the same reality using their senses individually and verify the observatio=\r\nn. However, some experiences of the mind that cannot be perceived by senses=\r\n are sometimes very powerful and have a huge, life-altering and sometimes l=\r\niberating influence on people. Inability to study and model them is a big d=\r\nrawback of modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One may =\r\ncategorize dreams and internal yogic experiences as imaginations or halluci=\r\nnations, because there is no independent validation, and call them unworthy=\r\n of a study. But there are cases that make one wonder. For example, see the=\r\n following messages from the archives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mystical experience=\r\ns of mind and mantras (message 951)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group=\r\n/vedic- wisdom/message/ 951\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one pers=\r\non had a specific yogic experience that was described in detail and another=\r\n person seemed to know about it and supplied one tangible detail relating t=\r\no the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the f=\r\nirst person, though it was beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Re: Guru (message 391)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ grou=\r\np/vedic- wisdom/message/ 391\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message also, on=\r\ne person had a specific yogic experience that was described in detail and a=\r\nnother person seemed to know about it and supplied a couple of tangible det=\r\nails relating to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the expe=\r\nrience of the first person, though it was beyond the external senses of eit=\r\nher person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Internal god and external god (message 2498)\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 2498\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one person had a specific yogic experience i=\r\nnvolving a deity and another person perceived with his external senses a vi=\r\nsion involving the same deity, though others in the room could not perceive=\r\n anything with their external senses, suggesting that the second person &quot;ob=\r\nserved&quot; the experience of the first person through a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such examples cannot prove much, but they=\r\n do suggest that perhaps *some* experiences that cannot be measured or perc=\r\neived by the external senses are observable by others, though not everyone =\r\nmay be able to observe. Then, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some*=\r\n experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses be=\r\ning a part of the &quot;reality&quot; that mind can access.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, how=\r\n can modern science study it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because the only thing that =\r\ncan be studied and measured is the reality involving the gross body and its=\r\n senses, one may suggest that experiences of the subtle body may be studied=\r\n by observing various parts of the gross physical body. For example, one ca=\r\nn look at the nervous signals flowing through various parts of the brain an=\r\nd try to correlate them with the experiences of the subtle body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; On the surface, it sounds like a great idea. But, it assumes that su=\r\nbtle body and causal body are redundant. Though there is some correspondenc=\r\ne between what happens in the causal, subtle and gross bodies, it is a many=\r\n-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in which case the concept of=\r\n causal and subtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. whatever they model can =\r\nbe moderled using just the gross body!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you drive throug=\r\nh a neighborhood and observe the houses from the road, you can have *some* =\r\nidea of what is going on. A particular house with a lot of lights and sound=\r\n and many cars parked outside may be having a party. People in one particul=\r\nar house with no lights are probably out of town. But you can never be sure=\r\n what is going on in the house, how many people are inside, what exactly th=\r\ney are doing etc, by merely looking at the house from outside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Similarly, by looking at the nervous signals in various points of the =\r\nbrain, you may be able to see some basic things, but not much. The experien=\r\nces of the subtle mind are beyond your reach and study, if your tools are l=\r\nimited to the gross physical domain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Unfortunately, modern science cannot study that part of the reality which=\r\n is beyond the scope of external senses, unless scientists become yogis and=\r\n develop mastery of the internal world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While rishis of an=\r\ncient times had mastery of the internal world (which is the microcosm of th=\r\ne entire universe) and could observe any space-time point, even the greates=\r\nt yogis of today cannot control their state completely. When Kundalini rise=\r\ns, it may go somewhere and one may experience some part of the Infinite Rea=\r\nlity. But one cannot control exactly where Kundalini goes and exactly which=\r\n part of the Infinite Reality one observes. Rishis seemed to have a perfect=\r\n control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short=\r\n Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Ta=\r\nrpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish les=\r\nsons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish softw=\r\nare (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre=\r\n (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi n=\r\nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry the previous mail went off inco=\r\nmplete. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me men=\r\ntion some stuff from the diaries of Sri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self realized=\r\n Yogi of the highest order) - it maybe of some help to you. He did mention =\r\nin details about the process of creation as he saw it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n As per him, at the beginning was the point of ultimate chaos. Then from th=\r\nere came the &quot;vidhyut&quot; of Akash. As this &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted with the chaos=\r\n, it produced some universal energies which are more commonly known as the =\r\nuniversal deities like Shiva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the &quot;Vidyut&quot; of vay=\r\nu ( none of these are the actual physical elements as we see it, but more t=\r\nhe essence of the element, hence his use of the word &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; taranga=\r\n&quot;) whose interaction with the chaos resulted in some more energy states. Th=\r\nus, in this way came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting from the pr=\r\nevious and each one resulting in some energy states, which in the end resul=\r\nted in 33 crore possible states of energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is so=\r\nme lesson in there (at least for me), and I want to get at it.. I feel ther=\r\ne may be some correlation between that and the 11-dimensional physics of su=\r\nper string theory too, but I get ahead of myself..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thi=\r\ns is a nice idea and I would like to know more about it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; As much as I could fathom (I am no physicist, neither do I have the abil=\r\nity to penetrate the mathematics of the M-Theory), as it stands now, it is =\r\nquite half formed. There being multiple theories of the String variety, adh=\r\nered to by multiple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional one) is one of=\r\n the many which &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts some aspects of the physical wo=\r\nrld. Finding a correlation between this and the idea of the five elements, =\r\nin my humble opinion, is still far fetched. I can understand some correlati=\r\non between basic Quantum Mechanics, (at least the Copenhegan Interpretation=\r\n) , non-locality etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a link between=\r\n M-theory of panch-mahabhuta? !..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, with the kind =\r\npermission of Narasimha, I would like to know more about how exactly you ca=\r\nn link these two, because I myself with my limited understand fail to see a=\r\nny viable correlation at all as of now, specially, since the M-theory is ye=\r\nt in a very nascent stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The other thing one must th=\r\nink about is the basic nature of theoritical physics. Does physics describe=\r\n reality? Or does it provide a model of reality? These two are different. M=\r\nathematics provides a tool/model to gauge reality. It need not be exactly a=\r\ns reality is. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which is why Richard Feynman once famously quoted =\r\nthat everyone knows that Quatum Mechanics works, but no one know what it re=\r\nally is!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea of the pach mahabhuta and creation i=\r\ns almost the essence of everything. The day physics gets THAT deep, there w=\r\nould be really nothing more left to do. Physics is still quite far away fro=\r\nm that stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 29/9/09, vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@ &gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure if I ge=\r\nt the thrust of your point.

Hence, we=\r\n should not jump to conclusions which are not explicitly stated. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;A fact, required to understand why Ganesh, deity of=\r\n Mooladhara, is worshipped first.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Ganesha is worshipped first because it presides over=\r\n the Mooladhara, not because mooladhara has a connection with Agya. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Regarding the 6th tattwa there is nothing new to=\r\n it, it already exists, Yogananda writes in his commentary the following:&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;...Beyond the subtlest physical vibration (akasha, ether), Paramahan=\r\nsa Yogananda explained, is the superether,&quot; a finer manifestation and there=\r\nfore not classified as one of the physical vibratory elements (tattvas), of=\r\n which there are only five-earth, water, fire, air, ether. Some yoga treati=\r\nses define this tattwa as mind, or &#39;non-matter&#39; , as opposed to matter or g=\r\nross vibration... .&quot;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I am sorry, but the above quote is=\r\n a little vague. It no where mentions that Chitta is a 6th tattwa. What it =\r\ndoes it says about the 5 gross elements and &quot;a finer manifestation&quot;. Maybe =\r\nthe intented audience for this passage was one who is not intellectually aw=\r\nare of the basic&nbsp;idea of five creative elements. Otherwise, the &quot;super=\r\n-ether&quot; needs more clarity. Is it prakiriti? It is Chitta? Is it really six=\r\nth or does the six have more subsets? Is he calling it a vague six because =\r\nwe cannot be aware of the higher tattwas beyond the five, therefore clubbin=\r\ng everything together into one?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As you mention=\r\ned Samkhya, it uses a calssification of the universe in 24 tattwas with 5 w=\r\nhich cause physical manifestations to occur. It is still not 6 by any measu=\r\nre.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Again in Kasmiri Shaivism, they define 36 =\r\ntattwas! That is why the need to be technically precise so that we may not =\r\nmisunderstand each other.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&lt;EM&gt; The tattwas=\r\n are 5 in number as per multiple Hindu scriptures, both &gt; Agamas/Nigamas=\r\n as well as Upanishads.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Which scriptures ? Quotes ? &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;=\r\n/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Check the quotation given by Sun=\r\ndeep right at the begining of this set of mails. Are you questioning the ve=\r\nracity of scriptures or the fact that they mention creation is caused by fi=\r\nve gross elements?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;EM&gt;It is through Sankhya, that you c=\r\nan understand why Chitta is related to it. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As I said before, no one is denying the existence of Chitta. On=\r\ne is however questioning whether Chitta is a &#39;6th element&#39; . If you take Sa=\r\nmkhya, there are 24 elements, of which 5 are basic. And the rest are subtle=\r\n. So when normal creation is spoken of, it is spoken off in terms of 5 elem=\r\nents and not 6. When the essence of spirituality is spoken off right upto t=\r\nhe state of God, then we go into 24 or 36 (depending on your classification=\r\n). Further, in the 36 element lists, the &quot;suddha-tattwas&quot; are defined as un=\r\nknowable from this plane of existence. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;As Narasimha knows Jyotish shastra also, he could probably =\r\nfigure out the rashi to which the 6th tattwa is attributed since I have alr=\r\neady given the table out, so it is as real as it rises daily.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Umm, with due respect, no it is not yet easy.

If you=\r\n can provide an exact quote with page number and name of the book, I will t=\r\nry and check. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He explains in details about th=\r\ne &quot;granthi bhedans&quot; before one goes into actually awakening=C3=82&nbsp; any=\r\n chakra for that matter. These granthis have a specific format in which the=\r\ny have to be pierced as per Lahiri Mahasaya and it is here that a connectio=\r\nn is drawn between Agya and Mooladhara with Manipura in the centre.

When you say that Gu=\r\nnas by &quot;inherent duality&quot; in nature give rise to 6 tattwas, I guess you are=\r\n using a simple multiplication of 3 x 2 and arriving at six.

The five chakras downwards fr=\r\nom Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent ether, air, fire, water=\r\n and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, earth element within one is=\r\n\n surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are effaced in one&#39;s self-a=\r\nwareness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, water element within one i=\r\ns surrendered, i.e. all traces of water element are effaced in one&#39;s self-a=\r\nwareness. And so on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By eart=\r\nh and water etc, don&#39;t just think of physical earth and physical water etc.=\r\n Earth element shows a solid state of existence. Water element shows a flex=\r\nible and fluid state of existence. For example, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a p=\r\narticular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of sol=\r\nid state and made of earth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a particular t=\r\nhing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of =\r\nwater element. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to t=\r\nhe five elements.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one t=\r\nhinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a body that looks and feels in a\n parti=\r\ncular way physically. Apart from the physical aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; =\r\nas someone who has certain qualities, certain needs, certain belongings etc=\r\n. All those concepts one has about who one is, form one&#39;s self-awareness an=\r\nd Kundalini represents that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadh=\r\naara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulativ=\r\ne idea of who one is is still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishth=\r\naana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;=\r\ns cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. And so on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many people who talk about experiences o=\r\nf Kundalini in higher chakras are often talking merely about some amount of=\r\n vaayus flowing in those chakras (which may still be a nice experience) and=\r\n have *not* experienced Kundalini actually being there. IF Kundalini really=\r\n leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body, one\n will not hav=\r\ne notions of owning anything. Similarly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra,=\r\n each element is effaced in one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is, at the phy=\r\nsical as well as the subtle level of existence! To completely efface even o=\r\nne element (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short durati=\r\non of time, is not at all easy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; The order in which elements are effaced as one progresses towards samad=\r\nhi is - earth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again comes down, e=\r\nffaced elements return to work in the reverse order - ether, air, fire, wat=\r\ner and earth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding physics and spiritual real=\r\nities:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does physics des=\r\ncribe reality?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries=\r\n to describe/model reality at the gross physical level,\n as perceived by th=\r\ne external senses. However, one&#39;s mind can &quot;perceive&quot; things without the ex=\r\nternal senses playing a role.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; As a simple example, one may be asleep and get a dream, in which one&#39;s mi=\r\nnd may &quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between them. In another=\r\n example, a yogi may be meditating with a mantra with intense focus and &quot;se=\r\ne&quot; some scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot be perceived =\r\nby the external senses and hence cannot be studied by modern science.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define realit=\r\ny as something that can be perceived by the external senses, because differ=\r\nent people can experience the same reality using their senses individually =\r\nand verify the observation. However, some experiences of the mind that cann=\r\not be perceived by senses are sometimes very powerful and have a huge, life=\r\n-altering and sometimes liberating influence on\n people. Inability to study=\r\n and model them is a big drawback of modern science.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; One may categorize dreams and internal yogic experiences as imaginations=\r\n or hallucinations, because there is no independent validation, and call th=\r\nem unworthy of a study. But there are cases that make one wonder. For examp=\r\nle, see the following messages from the archives.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mystical experiences of mind and mantras (message 951=\r\n)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3D=\r\nnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 951&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one perso=\r\nn had a specific yogic experience that was described in detail and another =\r\nperson seemed to know about it and supplied one tangible detail relating to=\r\n the experience, suggesting that he too\n &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the f=\r\nirst person, though it was beyond the external senses of either person!&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Re: Guru (message 391)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;h=\r\nttp://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 391&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message also, one person had=\r\n a specific yogic experience that was described in detail and another perso=\r\nn seemed to know about it and supplied a couple of tangible details relatin=\r\ng to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of th=\r\ne first person, though it was beyond the external senses of either person!&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Internal god and external go=\r\nd (message 2498)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/=\r\nmessage/ 2498&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above =\r\nmessage, one person had a specific yogic experience involving a deity and a=\r\nnother person perceived with his external senses a vision involving the sam=\r\ne deity, though others in the room could not perceive anything with their e=\r\nxternal senses, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the experience=\r\n of the first person through a specific prism.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suc=\r\nh examples cannot prove much, but they do suggest that perhaps *some* exper=\r\niences that cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses are obse=\r\nrvable by others, though not everyone may be able to observe. Then, one can=\r\nnot rule out the possibility of *some* experiences that cannot be measured =\r\nor perceived by the external senses being a part of the &quot;reality&quot; that mind=\r\n can access.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, how can mo=\r\ndern science study it?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Beca=\r\nuse the only thing that can be studied and measured is the reality involvin=\r\ng the gross body and its senses, one may suggest that experiences of the su=\r\nbtle body may be studied by observing various parts of the gross physical b=\r\nody. For example, one can look at the nervous signals flowing through vario=\r\nus parts of the brain and try to correlate them with the experiences of the=\r\n subtle body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the surface=\r\n, it sounds like a great idea. But, it assumes that subtle body and causal =\r\nbody are redundant. Though there is some correspondence between what happen=\r\ns in the causal, subtle and gross bodies, it is a many-to-many mapping and =\r\nNOT a one-to-one mapping, in which case the concept of causal and subtle bo=\r\ndies would be redundant, i.e. whatever they model can be moderled using jus=\r\nt the gross body!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you dri=\r\nve through a neighborhood and\n observe the houses from the road, you can ha=\r\nve *some* idea of what is going on. A particular house with a lot of lights=\r\n and sound and many cars parked outside may be having a party. People in on=\r\ne particular house with no lights are probably out of town. But you can nev=\r\ner be sure what is going on in the house, how many people are inside, what =\r\nexactly they are doing etc, by merely looking at the house from outside.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, by looking at the n=\r\nervous signals in various points of the brain, you may be able to see some =\r\nbasic things, but not much. The experiences of the subtle mind are beyond y=\r\nour reach and study, if your tools are limited to the gross physical domain=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern science cannot study that =\r\npart of the reality which is beyond the scope of external senses, unless sc=\r\nientists become yogis\n and develop mastery of the internal world.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While rishis of ancient times had mas=\r\ntery of the internal world (which is the microcosm of the entire universe) =\r\nand could observe any space-time point, even the greatest yogis of today ca=\r\nnnot control their state completely. When Kundalini rises, it may go somewh=\r\nere and one may experience some part of the Infinite Reality. But one canno=\r\nt control exactly where Kundalini goes and exactly which part of the Infini=\r\nte Reality one observes. Rishis seemed to have a perfect control.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nNarasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http=\r\n://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritualit=\r\ny: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups=\r\n.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish le=\r\nssons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow=\r\n&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyoti=\r\nsh software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri =\r\nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ =\r\n&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry the previous mail went off i=\r\nncomplete. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear =\r\nSundeep,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me me=\r\nntion some stuff from the diaries of Sri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self realize=\r\nd Yogi of the highest order) - it maybe of some help to you. He did mention=\r\n in details about the process of creation as he saw it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As per him, at the beginning was the =\r\npoint of ultimate chaos. Then from there came the &quot;vidhyut&quot; of Akash. As th=\r\nis &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted with the chaos, it produced some universal energies =\r\nwhich are more commonly known as the universal deities like Shiva, Vishnu e=\r\ntc etc. Then came the &quot;Vidyut&quot; of vayu ( none of these are the actual physi=\r\ncal elements as we see it, but more the essence of the element, hence his u=\r\nse of the word &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; taranga&quot;) whose interaction with the chaos re=\r\nsulted in some more energy states. Thus, in this way came, Agni, Apa and Pr=\r\nithwi, each one\n resulting from the previous and each one resulting in some=\r\n energy states, which in the end resulted in 33 crore possible states of en=\r\nergy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is som=\r\ne lesson in there (at least for me), and I want to get at it..
