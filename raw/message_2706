Ideally, ajn=\r\na should be awakened to some extent before mooladhara, in order to allow an=\r\n unaffected perception of the energies manifested by mooladhara and the low=\r\ner chakras. However, the awakening of mooladhara will help to further awake=\r\nn ajna. In fact, the best way to bring about awakening of ajna is through t=\r\nhe practices of moola bandha and ashwini mudra which are specific for moola=\r\ndhara....&quot;\n\n   Regarding the 6th tattwa there is nothing new to it, it alre=\r\nady exists, Yogananda writes in his commentary the following:\n\n&quot;...Beyond t=\r\nhe subtlest physical vibration (akasha, ether), Paramahansa Yogananda expla=\r\nined, is the superether,&quot; a finer manifestation and therefore not classifie=\r\nd as one of the physical vibratory elements (tattvas), of which there are o=\r\nnly five-earth, water, fire, air, ether.

Other scriptures refe=\r\nr to the same order of creation, including &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; , where Mahar=\r\nshi Vasishtha teaches creation, destruction and liberation to Lord Rama.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This Upanishadic understanding is als=\r\no consistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The five chakras do=\r\nwnwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent ether, air, f=\r\nire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, earth element wit=\r\nhin one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are effaced in one=\r\n&#39;s self-awareness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, water element wit=\r\nhin one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of water element are effaced in one=\r\n&#39;s self-awareness. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By earth and water etc, don&#39;=\r\nt just think of physical earth and physical water etc. Earth element shows =\r\na solid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible and fluid state =\r\nof existence. For example, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a particular thing (e.g.=\r\n a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state and made of =\r\nearth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a h=\r\nouse, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of water element. Thus, =\r\ndifferent mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the five elements.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a body that loo=\r\nks and feels in a particular way physically. Apart from the physical aspect=\r\n, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has certain qualities, certain needs,=\r\n certain belongings etc. All those concepts one has about who one is, form =\r\none&#39;s self-awareness and Kundalini represents that self-awareness. Kundalin=\r\ni cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature=\r\n within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. Kundalini c=\r\nannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* or *fluid=\r\n* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. =\r\nAnd so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many people who talk about experiences of Kunda=\r\nlini in higher chakras are often talking merely about some amount of vaayus=\r\n flowing in those chakras (which may still be a nice experience) and have *=\r\nnot* experienced Kundalini actually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves=\r\n Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body, one will not have notion=\r\ns of owning anything. Similarly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each el=\r\nement is effaced in one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is, at the physical as=\r\n well as the subtle level of existence! To completely efface even one eleme=\r\nnt (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of ti=\r\nme, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The order in which elements are ef=\r\nfaced as one progresses towards samadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and et=\r\nher. If Kundalini again comes down, effaced elements return to work in the =\r\nreverse order - ether, air, fire, water and earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding physics and spiritual realities:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Does physics describe reality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries to describ=\r\ne/model reality at the gross physical level, as perceived by the external s=\r\nenses. However, one&#39;s mind can &quot;perceive&quot; things without the external sense=\r\ns playing a role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a simple example, one may be asleep a=\r\nnd get a dream, in which one&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conv=\r\nersation between them. In another example, a yogi may be meditating with a =\r\nmantra with intense focus and &quot;see&quot; some scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. =\r\nThese things cannot be perceived by the external senses and hence cannot be=\r\n studied by modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define rea=\r\nlity as something that can be perceived by the external senses, because dif=\r\nferent people can experience the same reality using their senses individual=\r\nly and verify the observation. However, some experiences of the mind that c=\r\nannot be perceived by senses are sometimes very powerful and have a huge, l=\r\nife-altering and sometimes liberating influence on people. Inability to stu=\r\ndy and model them is a big drawback of modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * *=\r\n *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One may categorize dreams and internal yogic experience=\r\ns as imaginations or hallucinations, because there is no independent valida=\r\ntion, and call them unworthy of a study. But there are cases that make one =\r\nwonder. For example, see the following messages from the archives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mystical experiences of mind and mantras (message 951)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 951\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In=\r\n the above message, one person had a specific yogic experience that was des=\r\ncribed in detail and another person seemed to know about it and supplied on=\r\ne tangible detail relating to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;obser=\r\nved&quot; the experience of the first person, though it was beyond the external =\r\nsenses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Re: Guru (message 391)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ht=\r\ntp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 391\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\nn the above message also, one person had a specific yogic experience that w=\r\nas described in detail and another person seemed to know about it and suppl=\r\nied a couple of tangible details relating to the experience, suggesting tha=\r\nt he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first person, though it was beyon=\r\nd the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Internal god and e=\r\nxternal god (message 2498)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- w=\r\nisdom/message/ 2498\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one person had a=\r\n specific yogic experience involving a deity and another person perceived w=\r\nith his external senses a vision involving the same deity, though others in=\r\n the room could not perceive anything with their external senses, suggestin=\r\ng that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first person thro=\r\nugh a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such examples=\r\n cannot prove much, but they do suggest that perhaps *some* experiences tha=\r\nt cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses are observable by =\r\nothers, though not everyone may be able to observe. Then, one cannot rule o=\r\nut the possibility of *some* experiences that cannot be measured or perceiv=\r\ned by the external senses being a part of the &quot;reality&quot; that mind can acces=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, how can modern science study it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nBecause the only thing that can be studied and measured is the reality invo=\r\nlving the gross body and its senses, one may suggest that experiences of th=\r\ne subtle body may be studied by observing various parts of the gross physic=\r\nal body. For example, one can look at the nervous signals flowing through v=\r\narious parts of the brain and try to correlate them with the experiences of=\r\n the subtle body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the surface, it sounds like a great i=\r\ndea. But, it assumes that subtle body and causal body are redundant. Though=\r\n there is some correspondence between what happens in the causal, subtle an=\r\nd gross bodies, it is a many-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, =\r\nin which case the concept of causal and subtle bodies would be redundant, i=\r\n.e. whatever they model can be moderled using just the gross body!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you drive through a neighborhood and observe the houses from th=\r\ne road, you can have *some* idea of what is going on. A particular house wi=\r\nth a lot of lights and sound and many cars parked outside may be having a p=\r\narty. People in one particular house with no lights are probably out of tow=\r\nn. But you can never be sure what is going on in the house, how many people=\r\n are inside, what exactly they are doing etc, by merely looking at the hous=\r\ne from outside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, by looking at the nervous signa=\r\nls in various points of the brain, you may be able to see some basic things=\r\n, but not much. The experiences of the subtle mind are beyond your reach an=\r\nd study, if your tools are limited to the gross physical domain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern science cannot study th=\r\nat part of the reality which is beyond the scope of external senses, unless=\r\n scientists become yogis and develop mastery of the internal world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While rishis of ancient times had mastery of the internal world (=\r\nwhich is the microcosm of the entire universe) and could observe any space-=\r\ntime point, even the greatest yogis of today cannot control their state com=\r\npletely. When Kundalini rises, it may go somewhere and one may experience s=\r\nome part of the Infinite Reality. But one cannot control exactly where Kund=\r\nalini goes and exactly which part of the Infinite Reality one observes. Ris=\r\nhis seemed to have a perfect control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.or=\r\ng/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.or=\r\ng/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wis=\r\ndom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. ne=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sorry the=\r\n previous mail went off incomplete. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me mention some stuff from the diaries of Sri Shamach=\r\narun Lahiri (a self realized Yogi of the highest order) - it maybe of some =\r\nhelp to you. He did mention in details about the process of creation as he =\r\nsaw it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As per him, at the beginning was the point of =\r\nultimate chaos. Then from there came the &quot;vidhyut&quot; of Akash. As this &quot;Vidyu=\r\nt&quot; interacted with the chaos, it produced some universal energies which are=\r\n more commonly known as the universal deities like Shiva, Vishnu etc etc. T=\r\nhen came the &quot;Vidyut&quot; of vayu ( none of these are the actual physical eleme=\r\nnts as we see it, but more the essence of the element, hence his use of the=\r\n word &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; taranga&quot;) whose interaction with the chaos resulted in=\r\n some more energy states. Thus, in this way came, Agni, Apa and Prithwi, ea=\r\nch one resulting from the previous and each one resulting in some energy st=\r\nates, which in the end resulted in 33 crore possible states of energy.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is some lesson in there (at least for me), and I wan=\r\nt to get at it.. I feel there may be some correlation between that and the =\r\n11-dimensional physics of super string theory too, but I get ahead of mysel=\r\nf..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is a nice idea and I would like to know more =\r\nabout it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As much as I could fathom (I am no physicist=\r\n, neither do I have the ability to penetrate the mathematics of the M-Theor=\r\ny), as it stands now, it is quite half formed. There being multiple theorie=\r\ns of the String variety, adhered to by multiple physicists, the M-Theory (1=\r\n1 dimensional one) is one of the many which &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts som=\r\ne aspects of the physical world. Finding a correlation between this and the=\r\n idea of the five elements, in my humble opinion, is still far fetched. I c=\r\nan understand some correlation between basic Quantum Mechanics, (at least t=\r\nhe Copenhegan Interpretation) , non-locality etc, and the ideas of Indian m=\r\nysticism, but a link between M-theory of panch-mahabhuta? !..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, with the kind permission of Narasimha, I would like to know m=\r\nore about how exactly you can link these two, because I myself with my limi=\r\nted understand fail to see any viable correlation at all as of now, special=\r\nly, since the M-theory is yet in a very nascent stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n The other thing one must think about is the basic nature of theoritical ph=\r\nysics. Does physics describe reality? Or does it provide a model of reality=\r\n? These two are different. Mathematics provides a tool/model to gauge reali=\r\nty. It need not be exactly as reality is. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which is why Richard F=\r\neynman once famously quoted that everyone knows that Quatum Mechanics works=\r\n, but no one know what it really is!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea of the p=\r\nach mahabhuta and creation is almost the essence of everything. The day phy=\r\nsics gets THAT deep, there would be really nothing more left to do. Physics=\r\n is still quite far away from that stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 29/9/09, vedicastrostudent=\r\n &lt;vedicastrostudent@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not sure if I get the thrust of your point.
