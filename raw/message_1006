Shriram Sharma Acharya=\r\n\nDear ALL,\n\n\n*The Science of Sleep-2*\n   In this wonderful creation of God =\r\nthere are many creatures who do not\nsleep at all and yet remain healthy and=\r\n happy, and are able to perform all\ntheir activities perfectly well. Ants d=\r\no not sleep; nor do blackbucks, and\nantelopes. Horses take their nap in sta=\r\nnding postures. There have been some\nhumans too who did not sleep in their =\r\nentire lives. There is a case of one\nparticular lawyer who never slept righ=\r\nt from his childhood to death.\nContrariwise, there is a &#39;Kumbhakarni sleep.=\r\n&#39; Kumbhakaran, a character in\nthe Ramayan, used to sleep for six months at =\r\na stretch. These are some of\nthe puzzling aspects of sleep which yet remain=\r\n unsolved.\n\nThe yogic concept is that sleep undergoes a transformation at t=\r\nhe apex level\nof Samadhi. Here occurs the final resolution of sleep, which =\r\ncomes as a\nclimax of the yogic progression. But where is its starting point=\r\n? Which are\nthe factors which hamper sleep, and which ones are helpful? Mod=\r\nern\npsychologists are making inroads into the hidden layers of sleep and ha=\r\nve\ncome out with interesting results. According to them excessive brooding =\r\nis\ninimical to sleep, and so is negative thinking.\n\nLack of sleep is extrem=\r\nely injurious to mental and physical health.\nStatistics reveal that one sle=\r\nepless night reduces work efficiency by the\nsame extent as is caused by hig=\r\nh level of alcohol in blood. Lack of sleep\ndisturbs the rhythm of internal =\r\nbiological cycle and the body consequently\nis restricted to utilize only 60=\r\n =96 75% of its capacity. One sleepless night\ncan bring about a reduction o=\r\nf up to 30% in our thinking capacity. Inability\nto take a correct decision,=\r\n irritability, uncontrolled anger, temporary\nlapses of memory =96 all these=\r\n are some other ill-effects of insomnia.\n\nProlonged lack of sleep has a dir=\r\nect bearing on diseases like heart aliment,\nhypertension, diabetes etc. In =\r\nextreme cases, even sudden cardiac arrest may\noccur. Lack of sleep means me=\r\ntabolic and hormonal imbalance. It results in\nobesity, acidity and even ulc=\r\ners. The immune system is weakened, and the\nbody falls prey to many kinds o=\r\nf viral and other infections. According to\ndoctors, pain below the waist an=\r\nd headache are a result of insufficient\nsleep. It slows down the reaction t=\r\no situations of depression, frustration\nand anxiety. Continued lack of slee=\r\np puts the nervous system in a high state\nof agitation. It hampers the func=\r\ntioning of neurotransmitters and thereby\nstarts a cycle of multiple nervous=\r\n and mental disorders with serious\ncomplications. Not only the lack but als=\r\no the excess of sleep is harmful.\nStudies show that women who oversleep dam=\r\nage the functioning of their\nhearts. During sleep, the coronary veins shrin=\r\nk and its excess may invite\ncardiac arrest.\n\nResearchers of the Harvard Med=\r\nical School claim to have identified the\nprecise link in the chemical chain=\r\n that regulates the sleep cycle of the\nbody. This is the T.G.F. Alpha chemi=\r\ncal found in either side of the brain.\nThe leader of this research team say=\r\ns that the sensors in hypothalamus catch\nsignals from not only the brain bu=\r\nt also retina of the eyes. This is because\nT.G.F. Alpha is formed in the re=\r\ntina too. Its implication is that the\nquantum of light that enters the eye,=\r\n and its duration both affect the\nbiological clock of the body. For this re=\r\nason the sleeping-waking pattern\nkeeps changing with the gradual change in =\r\nseasons.\n\nWe can rid ourselves of the problem of insomnia by a proper under=\r\nstanding of\nthe art of living. If the life style is orderly, food and diet =\r\nis satwik,\nand thinking is positive there will not be any problem of sleep.=\r\n What is\nmore, with the help of various techniques of yoga sleep can even b=\r\ne mastered\nand harnessed into some extraordinary uses.\n\r\n--0016364571b8e668a5046167a558\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Source : &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.awgp.org/&quot;&gt;www.awgp.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://www.awgpsouth.org/&quot;&gt;www.awgpsouth.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Author : Pt.
