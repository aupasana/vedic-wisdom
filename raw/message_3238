These depends upon their karmic debts and too all plants\nand animals=\r\n are *living beings*.\n\nTo my belief there is no point in discussing about v=\r\negetarianism and\nnon-vegetarianism.\n\nTo my knowledge (this is my personal t=\r\nhinking) adharma is caused while a\nperson/living-being kills(/hurts) anothe=\r\nr living-being due to his\npride/ego(/without any reason).here living beings=\r\n refer plants and\nanimals -plants too die when they are plucked from soil.\n=\r\n\n1.So if a person plucks the plant/flower for presenting to God, the\nperson=\r\n is done his dharma as presenting the flower to god and meanwhile\nthe flowe=\r\nr is done his dharma of reaching god - so that person\nindirectly helping th=\r\ne flower to reach god.\n\n2.If a person plucks the same flower for to use for=\r\n his regular purpose,\nthen too the person doing his dharma so do the flower=\r\n, the flower done\nits dharma of reaching its goal of that person needs.\n\n3.=\r\nIf the same person plucks the same flower and throws it away, here the\nflow=\r\ner hasn&#39;t done it&#39;s dharma but the person has done his *dharma of\nhis sin* =\r\ndue to his karmic debt.\n\nThis example may be equated for all living beings(=\r\nincluding animals,\nplants and humans) and this may apply to de-forestation,=\r\n hunting animals\nwithout any reason, etc., so I think there is no point in =\r\ndiscussing\nabout vegetarianism and non-vegetarianism, and I think it&#39;s a &quot;l=\r\naw of\nthe nature&quot;\n\nregards,\n\nSurenthar P.\n\np.s: I&#39;m not well versed in veda=\r\n, this message is the instance of my\nthought on seeing this thread.\n\n--- In=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; N=\r\namaste Narasimha/Utpal and others,\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Just a few point I would like to=\r\n mention after going through most of\nthe posts in this thread.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; I co=\r\nmpletely agree to Narasimha&#39;s explanation of the degree of\nattachment in pl=\r\nants vs animals. Also I agree to the point that a meat\neater, if he were to=\r\n eat veg food for some months while reading the\nscriptures would feel spiri=\r\ntually benefited. One year back I had tried\nit for 108 days and I definitel=\r\ny felt some positive=C2 effects like a\nsense of purity of the mind.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;=\r\n Narasimha said:\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Eating meat increases tamas in one. It increases e=\r\ngo and\nidentification with body and makes spiritual progress more difficult=\r\n.\nAfter all, if one is eating flesh of an animal that was highly attached\nt=\r\no its body, the quality of body attachment will become denser in one.\nThis =\r\nis not conducive to spiritual progress.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; With due respect to everyon=\r\ne, I am not=C2 convinced of the above\nlines though I agree that for a meat =\r\neater, turning vegetarian is\nspiritually beneficial. I have a different exp=\r\nlanation. A meat eater is\nbasically addicted to the taste of meat. When he =\r\nforgoes the same, it\nrequires a degree of will-power and a conscious sense =\r\nof direction in\nthe mind. Like overcoming any addiction with a clear sense =\r\nof purpose\nthat I am doing it to help me spiritually benefit. This in turn,=\r\n when\nsuccessfully done, creates a sense of purity in the mind. The reason =\r\nfor\nthe purity is not so much about eating veg food, but more due to the\nme=\r\nntal force created by conscious abstinence from non veg food.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Simil=\r\narly, a regular=C2 vegeterian, if he or she were to shift to a\ndiet of ONLY=\r\n milk and fruits for some months=C2 - which is not his\nstaple diet -=C2  wo=\r\nuld feel a similar effect. As I see it, generation\nof will power is teh fir=\r\nst conscinous effect of the=C2 beauty of\nsadhana. This sense of mental puri=\r\nty maybe - I am not sure - related to\nthe generation of more bhutaagni. Tha=\r\nt which jolts you out of your\nnormal regularized habits will create a force=\r\n in the mind which is\nbeneficial.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Speaking of ego, for an average m=\r\nan not engaging in any specific\nspiritual=C2 pursuit (sadhana), I have real=\r\nly not encountered any\ndifference between people who are strict vegeterians=\r\n from birth or\npeople who have an omnivorous diet. That is why I am not at =\r\nall\nconvinced that an omnivorous diet for an normal human being blocks or\na=\r\nids him in any way any more than a vegeterian diet does. =C2 BUT\nabstinence=\r\n in any form and any degree,=C2 is=C2 a GREAT tool for\nspiritual benefit.\n&gt;=\r\n =C2\n&gt; I hope I expressed my view point clearly.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; =C2\n=\r\n&gt; Do not think that I&#39;ll be offended or misunderstand you to be a cruel\nhea=\r\nrted etc...\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Thanks!:)\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Vegterianism is related to Compession=\r\n against cruelty.

Some=\r\n of the other mails\nmentioned that people (non-vegeterians)=C2 should get o=\r\nut of the\n&#39;addiction&#39; of taste for non-veg. While I agree that non-veg food=\r\n is\naddictive to one who eats it, I would like to ask, is not vegeterian\nfo=\r\nod addictive to one who is a thorough bred vegetarian? Or are we\nimplying t=\r\nhat those who eat veg food - vegeterains by birth - are not\n&#39;addicted&#39; to f=\r\nood at all, and do not enjoy the food they eat?\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Ordinary we are all=\r\n addicted to food, veg or non-veg, and eat for our\npalates as much as for o=\r\nur stomachs, or so I thought.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2 Rajarshi\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt;=\r\n There is no intoxication greater than the sweet name of God=C2 -\nVimalanan=\r\nda.\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Sun, 13/12/09, pvr108 pvr108@... wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: pvr108 p=\r\nvr108@...\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] On the Vegetarianism Thread\n&gt; To: vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, 13 December, 2009, 4:22 AM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been extremely busy at work for a while now=\r\n and will continue\nto be, working long hours everyday. I just saw a few mai=\r\nls from the\nvegetarianism thread. Just a few quick points.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Se=\r\nlf-identification of human beings and animals with body and body\nparts is m=\r\nuch much stronger and denser than that of plants and trees.\nSelf-identifica=\r\ntion of plants and trees is very subtle. When a leaf or\nflower or fruit is =\r\nplucked or cut off from a plant or tree, the emotion\nexperienced by it is v=\r\nery subtle. On the other hand, if a body part is\ncut off in an animal or a =\r\nhuman being, the emotion experienced is much\nstronger. Even after death, an=\r\n animal may identify with the body and\nthink of it as &quot;I&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; The kaarmik =\r\ndebt formed by eating the flesh of an animal, which the\nanimal&#39;s mind consi=\r\nders as a part of &quot;I&quot; and is highly attached to, is\nmuch bigger than the ka=\r\narmik debt formed by eating leaves, vegetables or\nfruits of a plant or a tr=\r\nee or killing bacteria.\n&gt;\n&gt; As long as we live in a physical body, creation=\r\n of new kaarmik debts\nis inevitable. But we strive to minimize the debts we=\r\n create newly.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; You are what you eat. Our body and various che=\r\nmicals and hormones in\nit are formed based on what we eat.\n&gt;\n&gt; Meat is high=\r\nly taamasik. Eating meat increases tamas in one. It\nincreases ego and ident=\r\nification with body and makes spiritual progress\nmore difficult. After all,=\r\n if one is eating flesh of an animal that was\nhighly attached to its body, =\r\nthe quality of body attachment will become\ndenser in one. This is not condu=\r\ncive to spiritual progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; It is possible that a spiritual g=\r\niant from past ate meat and yet\nremained fully saattwik. However, it is not=\r\n easy to emulate such a\nperson. One wanting to overcome identification with=\r\n the body and make\nspiritual progress, is better off eating saattwik food (=\r\nsimple\nvegetables, fruits, greens, grains etc with mild spices).\n&gt;\n&gt; If a m=\r\neat-eating person stops eating meat and eats cooked vegetables,\ngreens and =\r\nlentils/dals (for protein) for several months, while trying\nto read spiritu=\r\nal literature and trying to make spiritual progress, one\nwill see that it m=\r\nakes a big difference.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Someone mentioned that Vyasa liked fis=\r\nh, Radha cooked deer for Krishna\netc. In matters like this, there is a lot =\r\nof misguided propaganda in\nmodern India. Assertions not backed by specific =\r\nquotes from classics or\nscriptures that can be verified by scholars are bes=\r\nt ignored.\n&gt;\n&gt; Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have given a clarion cal=\r\nl to\nIndians to be more pro-active and energetic. But that does not require=\r\n\neating meat. It is wrong to attribute to them support of meat eating.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nBest regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- -\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Wr=\r\nitings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana=\r\n:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://=\r\nSaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- =\r\nwisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings=\r\n\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The INTERNET now has a personality.
