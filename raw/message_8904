Its object is not personal Mukti, although M=\r\nukti is a necessary condition of the yoga, but the liberation and transform=\r\nation of the human being. It is not personal Ananda, but the bringing down =\r\nof the divine Ananda--Christ&#39;s kingdom of heaven, our Satyayuga--upon the e=\r\narth. Of moksa we have no personal need; for the soul is nityamukta and bon=\r\ndage is an illusion. We play at being bound, we are not really bound. We ca=\r\nn be free when God wills; for he, our supreme Self, is the master of the ga=\r\nme, and without his grace and permission no soul can leave the game. It is =\r\noften God&#39;s will in us to take through the mind the bhoga of ignorance, of =\r\nthe dualities, of joy and grief, of pleasure and pain, of virtue and sin, o=\r\nf enjoyment and renunciation: for long ages, in many countries, he never ev=\r\nen thinks of the yoga but plays out this play century after century without=\r\n wearying of it. There is nothing evil in this, nothing which we need conde=\r\nmn or from which we need shrink,--it is God&#39;s play. The wise man is he who =\r\nrecognises this truth and knowing his freedom, yet plays out God&#39;s play, wa=\r\niting for his command to change the methods of the game.\n\nThe command is no=\r\nw. God always keeps for himself a chosen country in which the higher knowle=\r\ndge is through all chances and dangers, by the few or the many, continually=\r\n preserved, and for the present, in this Chaturyuga at least, that country =\r\nis India. Whenever he chooses to take the full pleasure of ignorance, of th=\r\ne dualities, of strife and wrath and tears and weakness and selfishness, th=\r\ne tamasic and rajasic pleasures, of the play of the Kali in short, he dims =\r\nthe knowledge in India and puts her down into weakness and degradation so t=\r\nhat she may retire into herself and not interfere with this movement of his=\r\n Lila. When he wants to rise up from the mud and Narayana in man to become =\r\nonce again mighty and wise and blissful, then he once more pours out the kn=\r\nowledge on India and raises her up so that she may give the knowledge with =\r\nits necessary consequences of might, wisdom and bliss to the whole world. W=\r\nhen there is the contracted movement of knowledge, the yogins in India with=\r\ndraw from the world and practise yoga for their own liberation and delight =\r\nor for the liberation of a few disciples; but when the movement of knowledg=\r\ne again expands and the soul of India expands with it, they come forth once=\r\n more and work in the world and for the world. Yogins like Janaka, Ajatasha=\r\ntru and Kartavirya once more sit on the thrones of the world and govern the=\r\n nations.\n\nGod&#39;s Lila in man moves always in a circle, from Satyayuga to Ka=\r\nli and through Kali to the Satya, from the Age of Gold to the Age of Iron a=\r\nnd back again through the Iron to the Gold. In modern language the Satyayug=\r\na is a period of the world in which a harmony, stable and sufficient, is cr=\r\neated and man realises for a time, under certain conditions and limitations=\r\n, the perfection of his being. The harmony exists in its nature, by the for=\r\nce of a settled purity; but afterwards it begins to break down and man upho=\r\nlds it, in the Treta, by force of will, individual and collective; it break=\r\ns down further and he attempts to uphold it in the Dwapara by intellectual =\r\nregulation and common consent and rule; then in the Kali it finally collaps=\r\nes and is destroyed. But the Kali is not merely evil; in it the necessary c=\r\nonditions are progressively built up for a new Satya, another harmony, a mo=\r\nre advanced perfection. In the period of the Kali which has passed, still e=\r\nndures in its effects, but is now at an end, there has been a general destr=\r\nuction of the ancient knowledge and culture. Only a few fragments remain to=\r\n us in the Vedas, Upanishads and other sacred works and in the world&#39;s conf=\r\nused traditions. But the time is at hand for a first movement upward, the f=\r\nirst attempt to build up a new harmony and perfection. That is the reason w=\r\nhy so many ideas are abroad for the perfection of human society, knowledge,=\r\n religion and morals. But the true harmony has not yet been found.\n\nIt is o=\r\nnly India that can discover the harmony, because it is only by a change--no=\r\nt a mere readjustment--of man&#39;s present nature that it can be developed, an=\r\nd such a change is not possible except by yoga. The nature of man and of th=\r\nings is at present a discord, a harmony that has got out of tune. The whole=\r\n heart and action and mind of man must be changed, but from within, not fro=\r\nm without, not by political and social institutions, not even by creeds and=\r\n philosophies, but by realisation of God in ourselves and the world and a r=\r\nemoulding of life by that realisation. This can only be effected by Purnayo=\r\nga, a yoga not devoted to a particular purpose, even though that purpose be=\r\n Mukti or Ananda, but to the fulfilment of the divine humanity in ourselves=\r\n and others. For this purpose the practices of Hatha and Raja Yoga are not =\r\nsufficient and even the Trimarga will not serve; we must go higher and reso=\r\nrt to the Adhyatmayoga. The principle of Adhyatmayoga is, in knowledge, the=\r\n realisation of all things that we see or do not see but are aware of,--men=\r\n, things, ourselves, events, gods, titans, angels,--as one divine Brahman, =\r\nand in action and attitude, an absolute self-surrender to the Paratpara Pur=\r\nusha, the transcendent, infinite and universal Personality who is at once p=\r\nersonal and impersonal, finite and infinite, self-limiting and illimitable,=\r\n one and many, and informs with his being not only the Gods above, but man =\r\nand the worm and the clod below.\n\nThe surrender must be complete. Nothing m=\r\nust be reserved, no desire, no demand, no opinion, no idea that this must b=\r\ne, that cannot be, that this should be and that should not be;--all must be=\r\n given. The heart must be purified of all desire, the intellect of all self=\r\n-will, every duality must be renounced, the whole world seen and unseen mus=\r\nt be recognised as one supreme expression of concealed Wisdom, Power and Bl=\r\niss, and the entire being given up, as an engine is passive in the hands of=\r\n the driver, for the divine Love, Might and perfect Intelligence to do its =\r\nwork and fulfil its divine Lila. Ahank=E2ra must be blotted out in order th=\r\nat we may have, as God intends us ultimately to have, the perfect bliss, th=\r\ne perfect calm and knowledge and the perfect activity of the divine existen=\r\nce. If this attitude of perfect self-surrender can be even imperfectly esta=\r\nblished, all necessity of Yogic kriy=E2 inevitably ceases. For then God him=\r\nself in us becomes the sadhaka and the siddha and his divine power works in=\r\n us, not by our artificial processes, but by a working of Nature which is p=\r\nerfectly informed, all-searching and infallibly efficient. Even the most po=\r\nwerful Rajayogic samyama, the most developed pr=E2n=E2y=E2ma, the most stre=\r\nnuous meditation, the most ecstatic Bhakti, the most self-denying action, m=\r\nighty as they are and efficacious, are comparatively weak in their results =\r\nwhen set beside this supreme working. For those are all limited to a certai=\r\nn extent by our capacity, but this is illimitable in potency because it is =\r\nGod&#39;s capacity. It is only limited by his will which knows what is best for=\r\n the world and for each of us in the world and apart from it.\n\nThe first pr=\r\nocess of the yoga is to make the sankalpa of =E2tmasamarpana. Put yourself =\r\nwith all your heart and all your strength into God&#39;s hands. Make no conditi=\r\nons, ask for nothing, not even for siddhi in the yoga, for nothing at all e=\r\nxcept that in you and through you his will may be directly performed. To th=\r\nose who demand from him, God gives what they demand, but to those who give =\r\nthemselves and demand nothing, he gives everything that they might otherwis=\r\ne have asked or needed and in addition he gives himself and the spontaneous=\r\n boons of his love.\n\nThe next process is to stand aside and watch the worki=\r\nng of the divine power in yourself. This working is often attended with dis=\r\nturbance and trouble in the system, therefore faith is necessary, though pe=\r\nrfect faith is not always possible at once; for whatever impurity is in you=\r\n, harboured openly or secretly lurking, is likely to rise at first and be r=\r\nepeated so long as it is not exhaustively swept out, and doubt in this age =\r\nis an almost universal impurity. But even when doubt assails, stand by and =\r\nwait for it to pass, availing yourself if possible of the satsanga of those=\r\n who are already advanced on the path, but when that is absent, still holdi=\r\nng fast to the principle of the yoga, self-surrender. When distressed withi=\r\nn or assailed from without, remember the words of the Gita,\n\n&quot;By giving thy=\r\nself up in heart and mind to Me, thou shalt cross over all difficulties and=\r\n perils by My grace,&quot;\n\nand again,\n\n&quot;Abandon all dharmas (all law, rule, mea=\r\nns and codes of every kind whether formed by previous habit and belief or i=\r\nmposed from outside) and take refuge in Me alone; I will deliver thee from =\r\nall sin and evil,--do not grieve.&quot;\n\n&quot;I will deliver&quot;,--you have not to be t=\r\nroubled or struggle yourself as if the responsibility were yours or the res=\r\nult depended on your efforts, a mightier than you is busy with the matter. =\r\nNeither disease nor calamity nor the rising of sin and impurity in you shou=\r\nld cause any alarm. Hold fast only to him. &quot;I will deliver thee from all si=\r\nn and evil.&quot; But the release does not come by a sudden miracle, it comes by=\r\n a process of purification and these things are a part of the process. They=\r\n are like the dust that rises in clouds when a room long uncleaned is at la=\r\nst swept out. Though the dust seem to choke you, yet persevere, m=E2 shucah=\r\n.\n\nIn order to stand aside, you must know yourself as the Purusha who merel=\r\ny watches, consents to God&#39;s work, holds up the Adhar and enjoys the fruits=\r\n that God gives. The work itself is done by God as Shakti, by Kali, and is =\r\noffered up by her as a Yajna to Sri Krishna; you are the Yajamana who sees =\r\nthe sacrifice done, whose presence is necessary to every movement of the sa=\r\ncrifice and who tastes its results. This separation of yourself, this renun=\r\nciation of the kartritva-abhim=E2na (the idea of yourself as the doer) is e=\r\nasier if you know what the Adhar is. Above the buddhi which is the highest =\r\nfunction of mind is the higher buddhi, or vij=F1=E2na, the seat of the saty=\r\nadharma, truth of knowledge, truth of bh=E2va, truth of action, and above t=\r\nhis ideal faculty is the =E2nanda or cosmic bliss in which the divine part =\r\nof you dwells. It is of this vij=F1=E2na and this =E2nanda that Christ spok=\r\ne as the kingdom of God that is within you. We at present are awake, j=E2gr=\r\nat, in the lower movements but susupta, fast asleep, in the vij=F1=E2na and=\r\n =E2nanda; we have to awaken these levels of consciousness within us and th=\r\neir awakening and unmixed activity is the siddhi of the yoga. For when that=\r\n happens, we gain the condition of being which is called in the Gita dwelli=\r\nng in God, of which Sri Krishna speaks when he says, mayi nivasisyasyeva, &quot;=\r\nVerily thou shalt dwell in Me.&quot; Once it is gained, we are free and blessed =\r\nand have everything towards which we strive.\n\nThe third process of the yoga=\r\n is to perceive all things as God. First, as a rule, in the process of know=\r\nledge one comes to see pervading all space and time one divine impersonal E=\r\nxistence, Sad Atman, without movement, distinction or feature, sh=E2ntam al=\r\naksanam, in which all names and forms seem to stand with a very doubtful or=\r\n a very minor reality. In this realisation the One may seem to be the only =\r\nreality and everything else Maya, a purposeless and inexplicable illusion. =\r\nBut afterwards, if you do not stop short and limit yourself by the imperson=\r\nal realisation, you will come to see the same Atman not only containing and=\r\n supporting all created things, but informing and filling them, and eventua=\r\nlly you will be able to understand that even the names and forms are Brahma=\r\nn. You will then be able to live more and more in the knowledge which the U=\r\npanishads and the Gita hold up as the rule of life; you will see the Self i=\r\nn all existing things and all existing things in the Self, =E2tm=E2nam sarv=\r\nabh=FBtesu sarvabh=FBt=E2ni c=E2tmani; you will be aware of all things as B=\r\nrahman, sarvam khalvidam brahma. But the crowning realisation of this yoga =\r\nis when you become aware of the whole world as the expression, play or Lila=\r\n of an infinite divine personality, when you see in all, not the impersonal=\r\n Sad Atman which is the basis of manifest existence,--although you do not l=\r\nose that knowledge,--but Sri Krishna who at once is, bases and transcends a=\r\nll manifest and unmanifest existence, avyakto &#39;vyakt=E2t parah. For behind =\r\nthe Sad Atman is the silence of the Asat which the Buddhist Nihilists reali=\r\nsed as the sh=FBnyam and beyond that silence is the Paratpara Purusha (puru=\r\nso varenya =E2dityavarnas tamasah parast=E2t). It is he who has made this w=\r\norld out of his being and is immanent in and sustains it as the infinite-fi=\r\nnite Ishwara, ananta and s=E2nta, Shiva and Narayana, Sri Krishna the Lilam=\r\naya who draws all of us to him by his love, compels all of us by his master=\r\nies and plays his eternal play of joy and strength and beauty in the manifo=\r\nld world.\n\nThe world is only a play of his being, knowledge and delight, sa=\r\nt, cit and =E2nanda. Matter itself, you will one day realise, is not materi=\r\nal, it is not substance but form of consciousness, guna, the result of qual=\r\nity of being perceived by sense-knowledge. Solidity itself is only a combin=\r\nation of the gunas, samhati and dhriti, cohesion and permanence, a state of=\r\n conscious being, nothing else. Matter, life, mind and what is beyond mind,=\r\n it is all Sri Krishna the Ananta-guna Brahman playing in the world as the =\r\nSachchidananda. When we have this realisation, when we dwell in it securely=\r\n and permanently, all possibilities of grief and sin, fear, delusion, inter=\r\nnal strife and pain are driven puissantly from our being. We realise in our=\r\n experience the truth of the Upanishads,\n\n&quot;He who possesses the delight of =\r\nthe Brahman has no fear from anything in the world,&quot;\n\nand that other in the=\r\n Isha Upanishad,\n\n&quot;When all created things become one with a man&#39;s self by =\r\nhis getting the knowledge (vij=F1=E2na), thereafter what bewilderment can h=\r\ne have or what grief, when in all things he sees their oneness?&quot;\n\nThe whole=\r\n world then appears to us in a changed aspect, as an ocean of beauty, good,=\r\n light, bliss, exultant movement on a basis of eternal strength and peace. =\r\nWe see all things as shubha, shiva, mangala, =E2nandamaya. We become one in=\r\n soul with all beings, sarvabh=FBt=E2tma-bh=FBt=E2tm=E2, and, having steadf=\r\nastly this experience, are able by contact, by oneness, by the reaching out=\r\n of love, to communicate it to others, so that we become a centre of the ra=\r\ndiation of this divine state, br=E2hm=EE sthiti, throughout our world.\n\nIt =\r\nis not only in things animate but in things inanimate also that we must see=\r\n Narayana, experience Shiva, throw our arms around Shakti. When our eyes, t=\r\nhat are now blinded by the idea of Matter, open to the supreme Light, we sh=\r\nall find that nothing is inanimate, but all contains, expressed or unexpres=\r\nsed, involved or evolved, secret or manifest or in course of manifestation,=\r\n not only that state of involved consciousness which we call annam or Matte=\r\nr, but also life, mind, knowledge, bliss, divine force and being,--pr=E2na,=\r\n manas, vij=F1=E2na, =E2nanda, cit, sat. In all things the self-conscious p=\r\nersonality of God broods and takes the delight of his gunas. Flowers, fruit=\r\ns, earth, trees, metals, all things have a joy in them of which you will be=\r\ncome aware, because in all Sri Krishna dwells, pravishya, having entered in=\r\nto them, not materially or physically,--because there is no such thing, Spa=\r\nce and Time being only conventions and arrangements of perception, the pers=\r\npective in God&#39;s creative Art,--but by cit, the divine awareness in his tra=\r\nnscendent being.\n\n&quot;All this world and every object in this world of Prakrit=\r\ni has been created as a habitation for the Lord.&quot;\n\nNor is it enough to see =\r\nhim in all things and beings, sarvabh=FBtesu; you must see him in all event=\r\ns, actions, thoughts, feelings, in yourself and others, throughout the worl=\r\nd. For this realisation two things are necessary: first, that you should gi=\r\nve up to him the fruit of all your actions, secondly, that you should give =\r\nup to him the actions themselves. Giving up the fruits of action does not m=\r\nean that you must have the vair=E2gya for the fruits, turn away from them o=\r\nr refuse to act with a given end before you. It means that you must act, no=\r\nt because you want this or that to happen or think it necessary that this o=\r\nr that should happen and your action needed to bring it about, but because =\r\nit is kartavyam, demanded by the Master of your being and must be done with=\r\n whatever result God is pleased to give. You must put aside what you want a=\r\nnd wish to know what God wants; distrust what your heart, your passions or =\r\nyour habitual opinions prefer to hold as right and necessary, and passing b=\r\neyond them, like Arjuna in the Gita, seek only to know what God has set dow=\r\nn as right and necessary. Be strong in the faith that whatever is right and=\r\n necessary will inevitably happen as the result of your due fulfilment of t=\r\nhe kartavyam karma, even if it is not the result that you preferred or expe=\r\ncted. The power that governs the world is at least as wise as you and it is=\r\n not absolutely necessary that you should be consulted or indulged in its m=\r\nanagement; God is seeing to it.\n\nBut what is the kartavyam karma? It is ver=\r\ny difficult to say,--gahan=E2 karmano gatih. Most people would translate ka=\r\nrtavyam karma by the English word and idea, duty; if asked to define it, th=\r\ney would say it is the right and moral action, what people understand by ri=\r\nght and morality, what you yourself conscientiously think to be right or el=\r\nse what the good of society, the nation or mankind demands of you. But the =\r\nman who remains bound by these personal or social ideas of duty, necessary =\r\nas they are for the ignorant to restrain and tame their clamorous desires o=\r\nr their personal egoism, will be indeed what is called a good man, but he w=\r\nill never attain to the fulfilment of this yoga. He will only replace the d=\r\nesire for one kind of fruit by the desire for another kind; he will strive,=\r\n even more passionately perhaps, for these higher results and be more bitte=\r\nrly grieved by not attaining them. There is no passion so terrible as the p=\r\nassion of the altruist, no egoism so hard to shake as the fixed egoism of v=\r\nirtue, precisely because it is justified in its own eyes and justified in t=\r\nhe sight of men and cannot see the necessity for yielding to a higher law. =\r\nEven if there is no grieving over the results, there will be the labour and=\r\n strife of the rajasic kart=E2, struggling and fighting, getting eager and =\r\ngetting exhausted, not trigun=E2t=EEta, always under bondage to the gunas.\n=\r\n\nIt was under the domination of these ideas of personal virtue and social d=\r\nuty that Arjuna refused to fight. Against his reasonings Sri Krishna sets t=\r\nwo different ideas, one inferior for the use of the man bound but seeking l=\r\niberation, another superior for the liberated man, the Shastra and surrende=\r\nr not only of the fruits of the work but of the work itself to God. The vir=\r\ntue of the Shastra is that it sets up a standard outside ourselves, differe=\r\nnt from our personal desires, reasonings, passions and prejudices, outside =\r\nour selfishness and self-will, by living up to which in the right spirit we=\r\n can not only acquire self-control but by reducing even the sattwic ahank=\r\n=E2ra to a minimum prepare ourselves for liberation. In the old days the Sh=\r\nastra was the Vedic Dharma based upon a profound knowledge of man&#39;s psychol=\r\nogy and the laws of the world, revealing man to himself and showing him how=\r\n to live according to his nature; afterwards it was the law of the Smritis =\r\nwhich tried to do the same thing more roughly by classifying men according =\r\nto the general classes of which the Vedas speak, the c=E2turvarnya; today i=\r\nt is little more than blind mechanical custom and habitual social observanc=\r\ne, a thing not sattwic but tamasic, not a preparatory discipline for libera=\r\ntion, but a mere bondage.\n\nEven the highest Shastra can be misused for the =\r\npurposes of egoism, the egoism of virtue and the egoism of prejudice and pe=\r\nrsonal opinion. At its best it is a great means towards the preparation of =\r\nliberation. It is shabda-brahma. But we must not be satisfied with mere pre=\r\nparation, we must, as soon as our eyes are opened, hasten on to actual free=\r\ndom. The liberated soul and the sadhak of liberation who has surrendered ev=\r\nen his actions to God, gets beyond the highest Shastra, shabdabrahm=E2tivar=\r\ntate.\n\nThe best foundation for the surrender of action is the realisation t=\r\nhat Prakriti is doing all our actions at God&#39;s command and God through our =\r\nsvabh=E2va determines the action. From that moment the action belongs to hi=\r\nm, it is not yours nor the responsibility yours; there is indeed no respons=\r\nibility, no bondage of Karma, for God has no responsibility, but is in ever=\r\ny way master and free. Our actions become not only like the Shastric man&#39;s =\r\nsvabh=E2vaniyata, regulated by nature and therefore dharma, but the svabh=\r\n=E2va itself is controlled like a machine by God. It is not easy for us, fu=\r\nll as we are of the Sanskaras of ignorance, to arrive at this stage of know=\r\nledge, but there are three stages by which it can be rapidly done. The firs=\r\nt is to live in the spirit of the shloka,\n\n&quot;According as I am appointed by =\r\nThee, O Hrishikesha! seated in my heart, so I act.&quot;\n\nWhen this has entered =\r\ninto your daily life, it will be easier to accomplish the second stage and =\r\nlive in the knowledge of the Gita,\n\n&quot;God stands in the heart of all beings,=\r\n whirling round all, as on a wheel, by the Maya of the three gunas.&quot;\n\nYou w=\r\nill then be able to perceive the action of the three gunas in you and watch=\r\n the machinery at its work, no longer saying, tath=E2 karomi, I do, but gun=\r\n=E2 vartanta eva, it is merely the gunas that work. One great difficulty in=\r\n these stages, especially before you can distinguish the action of the guna=\r\ns, is the perception of the impurity of the svabh=E2va, the haunting idea o=\r\nf sin and virtue.\n\nYou must always remember that, since you have put yourse=\r\nlf in God&#39;s hands, he will work out the impurities and you have only to be =\r\ncareful, as you cannot be attached either to p=E2pa or punya, sin or virtue=\r\n. For he has repeatedly given the abhaya vacana, the assurance of safety. &quot;=\r\nPratij=E2n=EEhi,&quot; he says in the Gita, &quot;na me bhaktah pranashyati, he who i=\r\ns devoted to Me cannot perish.&quot; The third stage comes out of the second, by=\r\n full realisation of God, or of itself by the grace of God. Not only will t=\r\nhe Purusha stand apart and be trigun=E2t=EEta, beyond the three gunas, but =\r\nthe Prakriti, though using the gunas, will be free from their bondage. Satt=\r\nwa, as we know it, will disappear into pure prak=E2sha and jyotih, and the =\r\nnature will live in a pure, free and infinite self-existing illumination. T=\r\namas, as we know it, will disappear into pure shama or sh=E2nti, and the na=\r\nture will take its firm stand on an infinite and ineffable rest and peace. =\r\nRajas, as we know it, will disappear into pure tapas, and the nature will f=\r\nlow in a free and infinite ocean of divine force. On that foundation of cal=\r\nm and in that heaven of light, action will occur as the spontaneous objecti=\r\nve expression of God&#39;s knowledge, which is one with God&#39;s will. This is the=\r\n condition of infinity, =E2nantya, in which this struggle of bound and limi=\r\nted sattwa, rajas and tamas is replaced by a mighty harmony of free prak=E2=\r\nsha, tapas and shama. And even before you reach that condition, on the way =\r\nto it, you will find that some mighty force not your own, not situated in y=\r\nour body though possessing and occupying it, is thinking for you, feeling f=\r\nor you, acting for you, your very body as well as your mind and heart being=\r\n moved by that force and not by yourself. You will enjoy that thought, feel=\r\ning, action, but will neither possess nor be possessed by it,--karm=E2ni pr=\r\navil=EEyante, your actions will disappear without leaving in you mark or tr=\r\nace, as a wave disappears from the surface of the sea, as water falls from =\r\nthe lotus leaf.\n\nYour mind, heart, body will not be yours, but God&#39;s; you y=\r\nourself will be only a centre of being, knowledge and bliss through which G=\r\nod works in that Adhar. This is the condition in which one is utterly tacci=\r\nttah, given up in all his conscious being to God, in which there is utter f=\r\nulfilment of the description,\n\n&quot;One whose state of being is free from egois=\r\nm and whose understanding receives no stain.&quot;\n\nThis is the surrender of act=\r\nion to which Sri Krishna gives so much importance.\n\n&quot;Laying down all action=\r\ns upon Me, with thy whole conscious being in adhy=E2tmayoga, become free fr=\r\nom desire and the sense of belongings; fight, let the fever of thy soul pas=\r\ns from thee.&quot;\n\nFor this great and complete liberation it is necessary that =\r\nyou should be nihspriha, nirdvandva and nirahank=E2ra, without the longing =\r\nand reaching after things, free from the samsk=E2ra of the dualities and fr=\r\nee from egoism; for these three things are the chief enemies of self-surren=\r\nder. If you are nirdvandva, you can be nihspriha, but hardly otherwise, for=\r\n every dvandva creates in the mind by the very nature of the mind some form=\r\n of r=E2gadvesa, like and dislike, attraction and repulsion, whether they a=\r\nre the lowest dualities that appeal to the mind through the body, hunger an=\r\nd thirst, heat and cold, physical pleasure and pain, or the middle sorts th=\r\nat appeal to it through the feelings and desires, success and failure, vict=\r\nory and defeat, fortune and misfortune, pleasure and displeasure, joy and g=\r\nrief, hate and love, or the highest which appeal to the mind through the di=\r\nscriminating buddhi, virtue and sin, reason and unreason, error and truth. =\r\nThese things can only be put under our feet by complete knowledge, the know=\r\nledge that sees God in all things and thus comes to understand the relation=\r\ns of things to each other in his great cosmic purpose, by complete Bhakti w=\r\nhich accepts all things with joy,--thus abolishing the dvandvas,--because t=\r\nhey come from the Beloved or by perfect action offering up all works as a s=\r\nacrifice to God with an entire indifference to these dualities of success, =\r\nfailure, honour, disgrace, etc., which usually pursue all Karma. Such knowl=\r\nedge, such Bhakti, such Karma come inevitably as the eventual result of the=\r\n sankalpa of self-surrender and the practice of it.\n\nBut it is ahank=E2ra t=\r\nhat by making the relation and effect of things on ourselves or on things c=\r\nonnected with us the standard of life, makes the dvandvas a chain for our b=\r\nondage. Ahank=E2ra in its action on our life and sadhana will be seen to be=\r\n of three kinds, rajasic, tamasic and sattwic. Rajas binds by desire and th=\r\ne craving in the nature for occupation and activity, it is always reaching =\r\nafter action and the fruit of action; it is in order that we may be free fr=\r\nom the rajasic ahank=E2ra that we have the command, &quot;Do not do works from t=\r\nhe desire of fruit,&quot; m=E2 karma-phala-hetur bh=FBh, and the command to give=\r\n up our actions to God. Tamas binds by weakness and the craving in the natu=\r\nre for ease and inaction; it is always sinking into idleness, depression, c=\r\nonfusion of mind, fear, disappointment, despondency and despair; it is in o=\r\nrder that we may get rid of the tamasic ahank=E2ra that we are given the co=\r\nmmand, &quot;Let there be no attachment to inaction,&quot; and the instruction to pur=\r\nsue the yoga always, whether we seem to advance or seem to be standing stil=\r\nl or seem even to be going back, always with a calm faith and patient and c=\r\nheerful perseverance, anirvinnacetas=E2. Sattwa binds by knowledge and plea=\r\nsure; it is always attaching itself to some imperfect realisation, to the i=\r\ndea of one&#39;s own virtue, the correctness of one&#39;s own opinions and principl=\r\nes or at its highest, as in the case of Arjuna, opposing some personal idea=\r\n of altruism, justice or virtue against the surrender of our will that God =\r\ndemands of us. It is for the escape from the sattwic ahank=E2ra that we hav=\r\ne to pass beyond the attachment to the duality of virtue and sin, ubhe sukr=\r\nitaduskrite.\n\nEach of the gunas working on the ahank=E2ra has its particula=\r\nr danger for the sadhak who has made the sankalpa of self-surrender, but ha=\r\ns not yet attained to the full accomplishment of the surrender. The danger =\r\nof the rajoguna is when the sadhak is assailed by the pride that thinks, &quot;I=\r\n am a great sadhak, I have advanced so far, I am a great instrument in God&#39;=\r\ns hands,&quot; and similar ideas, or when he attaches himself to the work as God=\r\n&#39;s work which must be carried out, putting himself into it and troubling hi=\r\nmself about it as if he had more interest in God&#39;s work than God himself an=\r\nd could manage it better.\n\nMany, while they are acting all the while in the=\r\n spirit of rajasic ahank=E2ra, persuade themselves that God is working thro=\r\nugh them and they have no part in the action. This is because they are sati=\r\nsfied with the mere intellectual assent to the idea without waiting for the=\r\n whole system and life to be full of it. A continual remembrance of God in =\r\nothers and renunciation of individual eagerness (sprih=E2) are needed and a=\r\n careful watching of our inner activities until God by the full light of se=\r\nlf-knowledge, j=F1=E2nad=EEpena bh=E2svat=E2, dispels all further chance of=\r\n self-delusion.\n\nThe danger of tamoguna is twofold, first, when the Purusha=\r\n thinks, identifying himself with the tamas in him, &quot;I am weak, sinful, mis=\r\nerable, ignorant, good-for-nothing, inferior to this man and inferior to th=\r\nat man, adhama, what will God do through me?&quot;--as if God were limited by th=\r\ne temporary capacities or incapacities of his instruments and it were not t=\r\nrue that he can make the dumb to talk and the lame to cross the hills, m=FB=\r\nkam karoti v=E2c=E2lam pangum langhayate girim,--and again when the sadhak =\r\ntastes the relief, the tremendous relief of a negative sh=E2nti and, feelin=\r\ng himself delivered from all troubles and in possession of peace, turns awa=\r\ny from life and action and becomes attached to the peace and ease of inacti=\r\non. Remember always that you too are Brahman and the divine Shakti is worki=\r\nng in you; reach out always to the realisation of God&#39;s omnipotence and his=\r\n delight in the Lila. He bids Arjuna work lokasangrah=E2rth=E2ya, for keepi=\r\nng the world together, for he does not wish the world to sink back into Pra=\r\nkriti, but insists on your acting as he acts,\n\n&quot;These worlds would be overp=\r\nowered by tamas and sink into Prakriti if I did not do actions.&quot;\n\nTo be att=\r\nached to inaction is to give up our action not to God but to our tamasic ah=\r\nank=E2ra.\n\nThe danger of the sattvaguna is when the sadhak becomes attached=\r\n to any one-sided conclusion of his reason, to some particular kriy=E2 or m=\r\novement of the sadhana, to the joy of any particular siddhi of the yoga, pe=\r\nrhaps the sense of purity or the possession of some particular power or the=\r\n Ananda of the contact with God or the sense of freedom and hungers after i=\r\nt, becomes attached to that only and would have nothing else. Remember that=\r\n the yoga is not for yourself; for these things, though they are part of th=\r\ne siddhi, are not the object of the siddhi, for you have decided at the beg=\r\ninning to make no claim upon God but take what he gives you freely and, as =\r\nfor the Ananda, the selfless soul will even forego the joy of God&#39;s presenc=\r\ne, when that is God&#39;s will. You must be free even from the highest sattwic =\r\nahank=E2ra, even from the subtle ignorance of mumuksutva, the desire of lib=\r\neration, and take all joy and delight without attachment. You will then be =\r\nthe siddha or perfect man of the Gita.\n\nThese then are the processes of the=\r\n yoga, (1) the sankalpa of =E2tmasamarpana, (2) the standing apart from the=\r\n Adhar by self-knowledge, (3) the vision of God everywhere and in all thing=\r\ns and in all happenings, the surrender of the fruits of action and action i=\r\ntself to God, and the freedom thereby from ignorance, from ahank=E2ra, from=\r\n the dvandvas, from desire, so that you are shuddha, mukta, siddha, full of=\r\n Ananda, pure, free, perfect and blissful in your being. But the processes =\r\nwill be worked out, once the sankalpa is made, by God&#39;s Shakti, by a mighty=\r\n process of Nature. All that is indispensable on your part is the anumati a=\r\nnd smriti. Anumati is consent, you must give a temporary consent to the mov=\r\nements of the yoga, to all that happens inside or outside you as part of th=\r\ne circumstances of the sadhana, not exulting at the good, not fretting at t=\r\nhe evil, not struggling in your heart to keep the one or get rid of the oth=\r\ner, but always keeping in mind and giving a permanent assent to that which =\r\nhas to be finally effected. The temporary consent is passive submission to =\r\nthe methods and not positive acceptance of the results. The permanent conse=\r\nnt is an anticipatory acceptance of the results, a sort of effortless and d=\r\nesireless exercise of will. It is the constant exercise of this desireless =\r\nwill, an intent aspiration and constant remembrance of the path and its goa=\r\nl which are the dhriti and uts=E2ha needed, the necessary steadfastness and=\r\n zeal of the sadhak; vy=E2kulat=E2 or excited, passionate eagerness is more=\r\n intense, but less widely powerful, and it is disturbing and exhausting, gi=\r\nving intense pleasure and pain in the pursuit but not so vast a bliss in th=\r\ne acquisition. The followers of this path must be like the men of the early=\r\n yugas, dh=EEr=E2h, the great word of praise in the Upanishads. In the reme=\r\nmbrance, the smriti or smarana, you must be apramatta, free from negligence=\r\n. It is by the loss of the smriti owing to the rush and onset of the gunas =\r\nthat the yogin becomes bhrasta, falls from his firm seat, wanders from his =\r\npath. But you need not be distressed when the pram=E2da comes and the state=\r\n of fall or clouded condition seems to persist, for there is no fear for yo=\r\nu of a permanent fall since God himself has taken entire charge of you and =\r\nif you stumble, it is because it is best for you to stumble, as a child by =\r\nfrequent stumbling and falling learns to walk. The necessity of apramattat=\r\n=E2 disappears when you can replace the memory of the yoga and its objects =\r\nby the continual remembrance of God in all things and happenings, the nitya=\r\n anusmarana of the Gita. For those who can make the full surrender from the=\r\n beginning there is no question; their path is utterly swift and easy.\n\nIt =\r\nis said in the &quot;Sanatsujatiya&quot; that four things are necessary for siddhi--s=\r\nh=E2stra, uts=E2ha, guru and k=E2la--the teaching of the path, zeal in foll=\r\nowing it, the Guru and time. Your path is that which I am pointing out, the=\r\n uts=E2ha needed is this anumati and this nitya smarana, the Guru is God hi=\r\nmself and for the rest only time is needed. That God himself is the Guru, y=\r\nou will find when knowledge comes to you; you will see how every little cir=\r\ncumstance within you and without you has been subtly planned and brought ab=\r\nout by infinite wisdom to carry out the natural process of the yoga, how th=\r\ne internal and external movements are arranged and brought together to work=\r\n on each other, so as to work out the imperfection and work in the perfecti=\r\non. An almighty love and wisdom are at work for your uplifting. Therefore n=\r\never be troubled by the time that is being taken, even if it seems very lon=\r\ng, but when imperfections and obstructions arise, be apramatta, dh=EEra, ha=\r\nve the uts=E2ha, and leave God to do the rest. Time is necessary. It is a t=\r\nremendous work that is being done in you, the alteration of your whole huma=\r\nn nature into a divine nature, the crowding of centuries of evolution into =\r\na few years. You ought not to grudge the time. There are other paths that o=\r\nffer more immediate results or at any rate, by offering you some definite k=\r\nriy=E2 you can work at yourself, give your ahank=E2ra the satisfaction of f=\r\neeling that you are doing something, so many more pr=E2n=E2y=E2mas today, s=\r\no much longer a time for the =E2sana, so many more repetitions of the japa,=\r\n so much done, so much definite progress marked. But once you have chosen t=\r\nhis path, you must cleave to it. Those are human methods, not the way that =\r\nthe infinite Shakti works, which moves silently, sometimes imperceptibly to=\r\n its goal, advances here, seems to pause there, then mightily and triumphan=\r\ntly reveals the grandiose thing that it has done. Artificial paths are like=\r\n canals hewn by the intelligence of man; you travel easily, safely, surely,=\r\n but from one given place to another. This path is the broad and trackless =\r\nocean by which you can travel widely to all parts of the world and are admi=\r\ntted to the freedom of the infinite. All that you need are the ship, the st=\r\neering-wheel, the compass, the motive-power and a skilful captain. Your shi=\r\np is the Brahmavidya, faith is your steering-wheel, self-surrender your com=\r\npass, the motive-power is she who makes, directs and destroys the worlds at=\r\n God&#39;s command and God himself is your captain. But he has his own way of w=\r\norking and his own time for everything. Watch his way and wait for his time=\r\n. Understand also the importance of accepting the Shastra and submitting to=\r\n the Guru and do not do like the Europeans who insist on the freedom of the=\r\n individual intellect to follow its own fancies and preferences which it ca=\r\nlls reasonings, even before it is trained to discern or fit to reason. It i=\r\ns much the fashion nowadays to indulge in metaphysical discussions and phil=\r\nosophical subtleties about Maya and Adwaita and put them in the forefront, =\r\nmaking them take the place of spiritual experience. Do not follow that fash=\r\nion or confuse yourself and waste time on the way by questionings which wil=\r\nl be amply and luminously answered when the divine knowledge of the vij=F1=\r\n=E2na awakes in you. Metaphysical knowledge has its place, but as a handmai=\r\nd to spiritual experience, showing it the way sometimes but much more depen=\r\ndent on it and living upon its bounty. By itself it is mere p=E2n&#92;,ditya, a=\r\n dry and barren thing and more often a stumbling-block than a help. Having =\r\naccepted this path, follow its Shastra without unnecessary doubt and questi=\r\noning, keeping the mind plastic to the light of the higher knowledge, gripp=\r\ning firmly what is experienced, waiting for light where things are dark to =\r\nyou, taking without pride what help you can from the living guides who have=\r\n already trod the path, always patient, never hastening to narrow conclusio=\r\nns, but waiting for a more complete experience and a fuller light, relying =\r\non the Jagadguru who helps you from within.\n\nIt is necessary to say somethi=\r\nng about the Mayavada and the modern teachings about the Adwaita because th=\r\ney are much in the air at the present moment and, penetrated with ideas fro=\r\nm European rationalism and agnosticism for which Shankara would have been a=\r\nstonished to find himself made responsible, perplex many minds. Remember th=\r\nat one-sided philosophies are always a partial statement of truth. The worl=\r\nd, as God has made it, is not a rigid exercise in logic but, like a strain =\r\nof music, an infinite harmony of many diversities, and his own existence, b=\r\neing free and absolute, cannot be logically defined. Just as the best relig=\r\nion is that which admits the truth of all religions, so the best philosophy=\r\n is that which admits the truth of all philosophies and gives each its righ=\r\nt place. Maya is one realisation, an important one which Shankara overstres=\r\nsed because it was most vivid to his own experience. For yourself leave the=\r\n word for subordinate use and fix rather on the idea of Lila, a deeper and =\r\nmore penetrating word than Maya. Lila includes the idea of Maya and exceeds=\r\n it; nor has it that association of the vanity of all things, useless to yo=\r\nu who have elected to remain and play with Sri Krishna in Mathura and Brind=\r\navan.\n\nGod is one but he is not bounded by his unity. We see him here as on=\r\ne who is always manifesting as many, not because he cannot help it, but bec=\r\nause he so wills, and outside manifestation he is anirdeshyam, indefinable,=\r\n and cannot be described as either one or many. That is what the Upanishads=\r\n and other sacred books consistently teach; he is ekamev=E2dvit=EEyam, One =\r\nand there is no other, but also and consequently he is &quot;this man, yonder wo=\r\nman, that blue-winged bird, this scarlet-eyed.&quot; He is s=E2nta, he is ananta=\r\n; the Jiva is he. &quot;I am the ashvattha tree,&quot; says Sri Krishna in the Gita, =\r\n&quot;I am death, I am Agni Vaishwanara, I am the heat that digests food, I am V=\r\nyasa, I am Vasudeva, I am Arjuna.&quot; All that is the play of his caitanya in =\r\nhis infinite being, his manifestations, and therefore all are real. Maya me=\r\nans nothing more than the freedom of Brahman from the circumstances through=\r\n which he expresses himself. He is in no way limited by that which we see o=\r\nr think about him. That is the Maya from which we must escape, the Maya of =\r\nignorance which takes things as separately existent and not God, not caitan=\r\nya, the illimitable for the really limited, the free for the bound. Do you =\r\nremember the story of Sri Krishna and the Gopis, how Narada found him diffe=\r\nrently occupied in each house to which he went, present to each Gopi in a d=\r\nifferent body, yet always the same Sri Krishna? Apart from the devotional m=\r\neaning of the story, which you know, it is a good image of his World-Lila. =\r\nHe is sarva, everyone, each Purusha with his apparently different Prakriti =\r\nand action is he, and yet at the same time he is the Purushottama who is wi=\r\nth Radha, the Para Prakriti, and can withdraw all these into himself when h=\r\ne wills and put them out again when he wills. From one point of view they a=\r\nre one with him, from another one yet different, from yet another always di=\r\nfferent because they always exist, latent in him or expressed at his pleasu=\r\nre.\n\nThere is no profit in disputing about these standpoints. Wait until yo=\r\nu see God and know yourself and him and then debate and discussion will be =\r\nunnecessary.\n\nThe goal marked out for us is not to speculate about these th=\r\nings, but to experience them. The call upon us is to grow into the image of=\r\n God, to dwell in him and with him and be a channel of his joy and might an=\r\nd an instrument of his works.\n\nPurified from all that is ashubha, transfigu=\r\nred in soul by his touch, we have to act in the world as dynamos of that di=\r\nvine electricity and send it thrilling and radiating through mankind, so th=\r\nat wherever one of us stands, hundreds around may become full of his light =\r\nand force, full of God and full of Ananda. Churches, Orders, theologies, ph=\r\nilosophies have failed to save mankind because they have busied themselves =\r\nwith intellectual creeds, dogmas, rites and institutions, with =E2c=E2rashu=\r\nddhi and darshana, as if these could save mankind, and have neglected the o=\r\nne thing needful, the power and purification of the soul. We must go back t=\r\no the one thing needful, take up again Christ&#39;s gospel of the purity and pe=\r\nrfection of mankind, Mahomed&#39;s gospel of perfect submission, self-surrender=\r\n and servitude to God, Chaitanya&#39;s gospel of the perfect love and joy of Go=\r\nd in man, Ramakrishna&#39;s gospel of the unity of all religions and the divini=\r\nty of God in man, and, gathering all these streams into one mighty river, o=\r\nne purifying and redeeming Ganges, pour it over the death-in-life of a mate=\r\nrialistic humanity as Bhagirath led down the Ganges and flooded with it the=\r\n ashes of his fathers, so that they may be a resurrection of the soul in ma=\r\nnkind and the Satyayuga for a while return to the world. Nor is this the wh=\r\nole object of the Lila or the Yoga; the reason for which the Avatars descen=\r\nd is to raise up man again and again, developing in him a higher and ever h=\r\nigher humanity, a greater and yet greater development of divine being, brin=\r\nging more and more of heaven again and again upon the earth until our toil =\r\nis done, our work accomplished and Sachchidananda fulfilled in all even her=\r\ne, even in this material universe. Small is his work, even if he succeeds, =\r\nwho labours for his own salvation or the salvation of a few; infinitely gre=\r\nat is his, even if he fail or succeed only partially or for a season, who l=\r\nives only to bring about peace of soul, joy, purity and perfection among al=\r\nl mankind.\n\n\nSri Aurobindo\n\n\n"}}
