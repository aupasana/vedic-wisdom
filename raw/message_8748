I thought I wo=\r\nuld share it with you as I thought it very inspiring.\n\nThe story is of a mo=\r\nnk called Brother Lawrence who lived in the 1600s in France. He lived a ver=\r\ny ordinary life, doing menial work such as cleaning pots and pans in the mo=\r\nnastery kitchen and repairing sandals. People ordered him about, and nobody=\r\n thought much of him. He died in relative obscurity after a long life.\n\nDur=\r\ning the latter part of his life, people had noticed he seemed to radiate an=\r\n extraordinary peace. \n\nHe was asked about his spiritual practice. He said =\r\nwords to the effect of...&quot;It&#39;s nothing much, I am a simple man and don&#39;t ha=\r\nve any special prayers or rituals as these just confuse me.&quot;\n\nBut\n\n&quot;I pract=\r\nice the Presence of God&quot;\n\n&quot;What do you mean?&quot; he was asked..\n\nHe said words=\r\n to the effect of....\n\n&quot;I talk to God all the time. I converse with Him. To=\r\ngether, God and I scrub the pots and pans, and do everything together. I fe=\r\nel His living Presence with me all the time. It was hard work fixing my min=\r\nd on Him for the first 10 years, but slowly, through His Grace, I have mana=\r\nged it after 40 years of practice. I feel so much peace and joy from this P=\r\nractice that I recommend it to everybody! I am as close to God in the noise=\r\n and clatter of the kitchen, as when I am on my knees receiving the blessed=\r\n sacrament in Church!!&quot;\n\nHis letters describing his extraordinarily simple =\r\nbut beautiful practice are really worth a read. This is a link to a book ab=\r\nout his practice....containing the conversations of a monk with him, and hi=\r\ns own letters to friends who asked him for guidance.\n\nhttp://www.ccel.org/c=\r\ncel/lawrence/practice.pdf\n\nHere is a bit about him on wikipedia \n\nhttp://en=\r\n.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brother_Lawrence\n\nHari Om,\n\nAparna\n\n\n"}}
