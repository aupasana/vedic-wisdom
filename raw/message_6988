But as Narasimhaji=\r\n said on\n&gt; multiple occasions &quot;IF&quot;  you are really lucky enough to get a fo=\r\nrmal\n&gt; initiation from a &quot;Qualified&quot; Guru then its like starting off with a=\r\n hefty\n&gt; bank balance. Then its upto you to build on the balance . But in c=\r\nase you\n&gt; dont get such a Guru (Such Guru&#39;s are rare and maybe not existing=\r\n at all in\n&gt; today&#39;s age).. then Nature will make arrangements for you to l=\r\nearn and this\n&gt; Yahoo Group is one such example. You probably start with a =\r\nZero Balance or\n&gt; may be some balance from your previous births . The very =\r\nfact that you are\n&gt; inclined to make spiritual progress is indicative of pa=\r\nst Good Karmas\n&gt; ..Regarding the choice of Mantras I dont think sequence re=\r\nally matters\n&gt; although the Devi Mahatmyam Book by Gita Press is standard a=\r\nnd flows\n&gt; logically ...As the Paramahamsa said instead of digging 100 hole=\r\ns\n&gt; (synonymous of  different Mantras/ Gods) in search of Water just dig on=\r\ne\n&gt; deep hole (synonymous of  a single Mantra/ Gods) and keep digging and\n&gt;=\r\n eventually you will find water.... As long as you are in this world and ha=\r\nve\n&gt; obligations towards your kins you will need to do mundane activities a=\r\nlong\n&gt; with Spiritual Activities and hence need to balance with whatever ti=\r\nme is\n&gt; available ..Just read what ever number of chapters of Devi Mahatmya=\r\nm you\n&gt; can read per day and adhere to the same standard. It is no doubt a =\r\ncomplex\n&gt; script and may take many months / years / Births to master based =\r\non ones\n&gt; samskaraas but keep preserving with devotion .. You can even star=\r\nt doing the\n&gt; regular Chandi Homa once you become comfortable with the proc=\r\nedure and the\n&gt; Text..

I got the book last year, but i still haven&#39;t\n&gt; started reading.\n&gt;\n&gt; T=\r\nhe reason being i&#39;ve come across all your posts and people responding to\n&gt; =\r\nyour posts, i.e whether a person who has not been initiated could read or\n&gt;=\r\n should not read. I&#39;m not able to conclude, even now i&#39;m reading the post a=\r\nnd\n&gt; text by Dr. Sathya Prakash Choudhary, but still unable to conclude.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; I&#39;ve read that people should be very careful while reading Durga\n&gt; Saptha=\r\nshati, i don&#39;t know to what extent and what could be the consequences\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\n do read Aditya Hrudayam, Srisuktham, Vishnu Sahasranamam, Lalitha\n&gt; Sahasr=\r\nanamam, Lalitha Trishati. I don&#39;t know how i started reading, no body\n&gt; gui=\r\nded me or initiated me how to read but i read it easily, whenever i do\n&gt; pr=\r\nayer i ask for for well being of all the people i know, sometimes just\n&gt; bl=\r\nessings and sometimes i don&#39;t even ask anything.\n&gt;\n&gt; I try to follow readin=\r\ng for one deity continuously for N number of days,\n&gt; then start reading for=\r\n other deities and follow the same rule.\n&gt;\n&gt; *About me: I&#39;m a bachelor aged=\r\n about 28*\n&gt;\n&gt; My questions\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. Should i start reading Durga Sapthashati=\r\n.\n&gt; 2. If so what are the do&#39;s and don&#39;ts .\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally the process to read=\r\n, i read the book and as per it, it is\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =95 Kavacham\n&gt; =95 Argala Stot=\r\nra\n&gt; =95 Keelakam\n&gt; =95 Navakshari japam\n&gt; =95 Ratri Suktam\n&gt; =95 Devi Maha=\r\ntmyam\n&gt; =95 Navakshari mantra japam\n&gt; =95 Devi Suktam\n&gt; =95 Rahasya trayam\n=\r\n&gt; =95 Kshama Prarthan\n&gt;\n&gt; Does it require the above process to be followed =\r\nstrictly to read single\n&gt; adhyaya per day or it&#39;s ok to just read the chapt=\r\ner without above process.\n&gt; Or in other ways what all should be read if i r=\r\nead a single chapter a day.\n&gt;\n&gt; Apart from these questions can a person rea=\r\nd Laitha Sahasranaama / Trishati\n&gt; after reading Vishnu Sahasranama or vice=\r\n versa.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Wishes,\n&gt; Balaji\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;\n\r\n--20cf307abcbbe0f79f04a9104483\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nNamaste,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Thank you Girish Ji and Srikanth Ji.

But in case you dont get such a Guru (Such Guru&#39;s are ra=\r\nre and maybe not existing at all in today&#39;s age).. then Nature will mak=\r\ne arrangements for you to learn and this Yahoo Group is one such example. Y=\r\nou probably\n start with a Zero Balance\n or may be some balance from your pr=\r\nevious births . The very fact that you are inclined to make spiritual progr=\r\ness is indicative of past Good Karmas ..Regarding the choice of Mantras I d=\r\nont think sequence really matters although the Devi Mahatmyam Book by Gita =\r\nPress is standard and flows logically ...As the Paramahamsa said instead of=\r\n digging 100 holes (synonymous of=A0 different Mantras/ Gods) in search of =\r\nWater just dig one deep hole (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;synonymous of=A0 a single Mantra=\r\n/ Gods&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;) and keep digging and eventually you will find water...=\r\n. As long as you are in this world and have obligations towards your kins y=\r\nou will need to do mundane activities along with Spiritual Activities and h=\r\nence need to balance with whatever time is available ..Just read what ever =\r\nnumber of chapters of Devi &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Mahatmyam you can read per day and =\r\nadhere to the same standard. It is no doubt a complex script and may take m=\r\nany months / years /\n Births to master based on ones samskaraas but keep pr=\r\neserving with devotion .. You can even start doing the regular Chandi Homa =\r\nonce you become comfortable with the procedure and the Text.. Agni and the =\r\ndivine mother will take care of the rest ..&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Regards,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Girish Sundaram&lt;br&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york=\r\n,times,serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new =\r\nyork,times,serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;hr size=\r\n=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Balaji L &lt;&lt;a=\r\n href=3D&quot;mailto:radeon82@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;radeon82@...&lt;/a=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;mail=\r\nto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Cc:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:pvr@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pvr@...&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Friday, July 22, 2011 11:05 PM&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n [vedic-wisdom] Q=\r\nuery Regarding Durga Sapthashati&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;Namaste Narasimhaji,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;This is my first post, I&#39;m a silent member of Vedic =A0Wisdom,=\r\n i read all the posts and thankful to all the members of this group.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have a query regarding reading Durga sapthashati.=A0&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;My query is i have a desire to read durga saptha=\r\nshati, this has been there since more than a year or two.
