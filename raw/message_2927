Flie=\r\ns, fleas, bugs, mosquitoes, other insects and thorns trouble you from one c=\r\norner. The sun scorches you in summer. Cold stings you in winter. Influenza=\r\n, plague, fashionable appendicitis, pyhorrhoea, smallpox are all ready to d=\r\nevour you. Then there are the three tapas (fevers): adhyatmic, adhidaivic a=\r\nnd adhibhautic. Fear, delusion, grief, sorrow and misery, kill you every mo=\r\nment.\n\nDesire, anger, hatred, jealousy, worry, anxieties and cares torment =\r\nyou every second. Deaths of persons whom you loved so dearly give you sever=\r\ne shocks. Yet you will never renounce the momentary pleasures of the senses=\r\n of this unreal mundane existence. Such is the depth of sensual enjoyments.=\r\n You will speak through ahankara: &quot;O, I am a powerful man. I am very intell=\r\nigent. I can do anything. There is no Ishwara.&quot; You will twist your glued m=\r\noustache and when the scorpion stings you sharply, you will cry out bitterl=\r\ny: &quot;O Narayana, Narayana, Narayana, help me. Relieve me of this horrible pa=\r\nin.&quot;\n\nIf the hair becomes grey, you invent various dyes to blacken it. You =\r\ninvent monkey-gland grafting for rejuvenation. If the teeth are fallen out,=\r\n you put on a new artificial dental set. You will never leave the &quot;will to =\r\nlive and enjoy.&quot; Miserable wreck that you are! Hopeless specimen!\n\nThink de=\r\neply. Cogitate. Reflect. Have constant satsang. Do selfless service to coun=\r\ntry and humanity. Develop the four means of salvation. Study Bhagavad Gita,=\r\n Yoga-Vasishta and Viveka-Chudamani of Sankara. Clear your doubts by approa=\r\nching learned sannyasins. Have recourse to sravana, manana and nididhyasana=\r\n. Remove the veil of ignorance and rest in your own swarupa--the Satchitana=\r\nnda state. Atma va are dyasktavyah shrotavyo, mantavyo, nidhidhyasitavyah?&quot;=\r\nThe self must be seen, heard, thought upon and deeply pondered&quot; (Brihadaran=\r\nyaka Upanishad 4:5).\n\nShun honour, respect, degrees, name, fame, power, pos=\r\nition and titles. They are absolutely worthless. They will not give you ete=\r\nrnal satisfaction. They will only intensify your vanity. They are all intox=\r\nicants of the mind, They will bring misery and mental disturbance. That is =\r\nthe reason why Raja Bhartrihari, Raja Gopichand and Lord Buddha deserted th=\r\neir kingdoms, riches, honors, etc. They treated them as trifles.\n\n\n"}}
