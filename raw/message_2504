In reality, a deity existi=\r\nng microcosmically &quot;inside&quot; you, a deity existing microcosmically inside me=\r\n, a deity existing microcosmically inside someone else and a deity existing=\r\n &quot;externally&quot; in the macrocosm (universe) is one and the same and there is =\r\nabsolutely no difference between all of them! That is essentially the Upani=\r\nshadic understanding.\n=A0\nIn fact, when you say &quot;inside me&quot;, ask yourself :=\r\n &quot;what is this I&quot;? Is it the physical body? Is it the subtle body? Is it th=\r\ne causal body? When mind entertains the notion that it is a physical body, =\r\nit indeed becomes aware of a physical body and looks at it as I. When mind =\r\nentertains the notion that it is a subtle body, it indeed becomes aware of =\r\na subtle body and looks it as I. When mind entertains the notion that it is=\r\n a causal body, it indeed becomes aware of a causal body and looks it as I.=\r\n When mind finally overcomes all such notions one after the other, it may l=\r\nook at the supra-cosmic body (supreme cosmic being) as I. According to upan=\r\nishadic understanding, there is nothing other than Brahman or supreme cosmi=\r\nc being. Thus, expressions like &quot;inside me&quot;, &quot;inside you&quot; and &quot;inside him&quot; =\r\nare just expressions that describe false notions rather than reality. There=\r\n is no real you, I and he, but there is only a supreme cosmic being.\n=A0\n*=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nWhen you have a conditio=\r\nned mind, which has a notion that there is a certain entity called &quot;Rajarsh=\r\ni Nandy&quot;, an entity called &quot;Narasimha Rao&quot; etc, these entities exist within=\r\n your mind, for as long as your mind=A0can keep those notions alive. When a=\r\nll such false notions are successfully eliminated, only=A0supreme cosmic be=\r\ning is left for the mind to focus on.\n=A0\nWhen a conditioned mind that has =\r\na notion that it is a specific person called &quot;Rajarshi Nandy&quot; in a specific=\r\n body, such a mind is pre-occupied with so many things that it cannot focus=\r\n itself on god perfectly.. Due to its pre-occupations, it can only focus it=\r\nself on small aspects of god, in a very limited way. This is like a mirror =\r\ncapturing Sun in a limited way. Sun&#39;s image may be reflected on 100 mirrors=\r\n in 100 ways. One mirror may be broken and dark colored. It may reflect ver=\r\ny little sunlight and sun may appear broken. Like that, each mind can focus=\r\n on god in a different way, to a different extent. We express this fact in =\r\nalternate words by saying &quot;the mind focuses on internal god and he is limit=\r\ned&quot;.\n=A0\nThis is just a simple way to put things. In reality, the issue is =\r\nnot internal vs external. The issue is the mind&#39;s ability to perceive and f=\r\nocus on god. As the mind&#39;s pre-occupation with other things comes down and =\r\nits ability to focus on god goes up, we say that the internal god is becomi=\r\nng stronger. Again, this is just a way of representation. In reality, god, =\r\nwhether you call him internal or external, is infinite and does not become =\r\nweaker or stronger. But mind can focus better and mind&#39;s idea of god become=\r\ns stronger. After all, a dirty mirror reflecting Sun may show a dirty and d=\r\null Sun at first and show a cleaner and brighter Sun after you clean the mi=\r\nrror. Sun has not really become cleaner or bighter. He is the same always. =\r\nWe can say &quot;Sun in the mirror&quot; has become cleaner and brighter. But there i=\r\ns really no Sun &quot;in the&quot; mirror! Though we may talk about Sun in mirror 1, =\r\nSun in mirror 2, Sun in mirror 3 and the external Sun, they are all one and=\r\n\n the same!\n=A0\nThis manner of speaking about internal vs external god and =\r\ntalking about strengthening internal god is used to simplify things. Bottom=\r\nline is that any visualization of god by a mind is limited by the condition=\r\ning, abilities and impurities of that mind. By allowing the mind to visuali=\r\nze god, to the best of its ability, on a regular basis, we sharpen its abil=\r\nity to visualize god. Eventually, mind loses all other pre-occupations and =\r\nbecomes fully absorbed in the infinite god. Then we say that internal god h=\r\nas become infinite. This is just a manner of speaking.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nI want to give a small practical exampl=\r\ne, that is somewhat relevant and illustrates some concepts.\n=A0\nOnce=A0a co=\r\nuple of priests with a high spiritual caliber were conducting a Rudraabhish=\r\nekam. They were chanting Sree Rudram 11 times. A person who worships Mahaal=\r\nakshmi was sitting in a corner of the room. He started to meditate with Sav=\r\nitru Gayatri mantra, his favorite mantra. Whichever mantra or deity he wors=\r\nhips, he always considers everything to be an offering to Mahalakshmi and i=\r\nmagines only her as receiving the mantra. Here also, he was visualizing Mah=\r\nalakshmi as filling his entire being and was offering Gayatri mantra to her=\r\n. After a while, his Kundalini rose and his self-awareness was modified. He=\r\n lost the regular awareness of body, perceived an all-pervading light that =\r\nhe was part of and remained in a nice spiritual state for a while. When he =\r\ncame back and the pooja was finished, one of the priests described somethin=\r\ng unusual that he &quot;saw&quot;. In the middle of the pooja, that priest turned tow=\r\nards this person and was surprised by what he saw. He saw\n a tall=A018-hand=\r\ned form of Mahalakshmi standing in=A0the place of this person for a little =\r\nwhile.\n=A0\nAs that person meditated, his=A0senses turned inward and he was =\r\nlooking internally. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshmi, who filled his en=\r\ntire being in his visualization. As Kundalini rose, his distinction of inte=\r\nrnal and external blurred and he perceived himself as *a part* of all-perva=\r\nding light (it is neither &quot;internal&quot; nor &quot;external&quot;). He basically perceive=\r\nd Mahaalakshmi as the all-pervading light that he was also a part of. Howev=\r\ner, the priest who happened to look at him at that time was also in a purif=\r\nied state and so he noticed something. His mental conditioning at that time=\r\n=A0made him see a specific=A0external form rather than an all-pervading for=\r\nm. But both the priest and the person perceived the same entity in two diff=\r\nerent ways. One was external and limited. The other was neither internal no=\r\nr external (but obtained by looking internally at first) and unlimited. But=\r\n, both are the same. They appeared different to two minds because of the\n c=\r\nonditioning of those minds rather than anything else, just as the same Sun =\r\nmay appear different in two different mirrors!\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nNo amount of theorization will help one fully u=\r\nnderstand and appreciate things like this. The most important thing is to d=\r\no some sadhana, such as homam or meditation, on a regular basis.. No effort=\r\n is wasted and eventually gives results when there is critical mass. Whatev=\r\ner I say, whatever masters have said before and whatever rishis taught in u=\r\npanishads, can be understood and appreciated through direct experience. THA=\r\nT is the goal of sadhana. Reading scriptures and mails like this is only a =\r\nstarting point. One has to engage in some sadhana. Even people like Ramana =\r\nMaharshi, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swami, Vivekananda etc did sadh=\r\nana for many years, before they realized god..\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n=\r\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\nDo=\r\n a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Ta=\r\nrpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http=\r\n://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJa=\r\ngan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;I litt=\r\nle bit of deviation from this topic of this mail.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;There is something =\r\nwhich I find a little confusion. I hope you will clear that point. You ment=\r\nioned:\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;The god in your homam fire is not an external god, but your ow=\r\nn internal god. Through your mental focus, you are projecting the limited m=\r\nanifestation of god inside you into fire and honing your ability to focus t=\r\nhe mind on that god. I want to clarify one thing here. Though there is actu=\r\nally infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation with so many other t=\r\nhings limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can focus on, access a=\r\nnd perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow it. Fire is a good m=\r\nedium to project it for focusing better.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;When we are doing a homam or=\r\n any puja, we are trying to create the deity from within ourselves where it=\r\n exists. My questions is, is this where all deities reside(inside) ? I mean=\r\n if I am focusing on Mahaganapati, am I just bringing out the energy of Mah=\r\naganapati from inside me or is there one single, universal, omnipotent divi=\r\nnty called Mahaganapati who exists in the universe, and I am trying to invi=\r\nte him into the fire?\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;I remember a line from Vimalananda where he say=\r\ns, initially we create the deity in the astral body=A0so that this deity (t=\r\nhe one we projected)=A0may lead us to the real deity who exists outside in =\r\nthe universe.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;Did I understand the procedure correct? Kindly put down=\r\n your thoughts on this.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt;-Regards\n&gt;=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;--- On Thu, 10/9/09,=\r\n Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt;Namaste Krishna Kanth,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;S=\r\nuppose god really came to your place in a human form and asked you to give =\r\nhim some nice food. Will you allow someone who cooks terribly to cook? Why =\r\nnot allow him to &quot;serve god&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;It is not just about &quot;serving god&quot;, but =\r\nserving god *well*. A purified servant of god serves god with single-minded=\r\n focus and devotion and has no other thoughts in mind when serving god. A m=\r\nore normal person may think various things in mind even when serving god. T=\r\nhere is some self-centeredness and ego even in serving god.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The god in=\r\n your homam fire is not an external god, but your own internal god. Through=\r\n your mental focus, you are projecting the limited manifestation of god ins=\r\nide you into fire and honing your ability to focus the mind on that god. I =\r\nwant to clarify one thing here. Though there is actually infinite divinity =\r\ninside you, your pre-occupation with so many other things limits (or zeroes=\r\n) the divinity that your mind can focus on, access and perceive. By focusin=\r\ng on it more and more, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to project it for=\r\n focusing better. On practice, the divinity inside you that you can focus o=\r\nn and perceive grows with time. Thus, remember that what is in fire is the =\r\nlimited manifestation of god inside you that you are able to focus, acces a=\r\nnd perceive. This limited divinity should be nurtured slowly and allowed to=\r\n grow, rather than used up for unnecessary things. When this divinity grows=\r\n and becomes infinite, all your desires and other\n thoughts will vanish and=\r\n you will be able to single-mindedly focus on that divinity. Some precautio=\r\nns will help you in the journey.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Karmas and thoughts of people who are=\r\n making offerings in your homam fire are basically being received in your i=\r\nnternal god. If he has enough power (his power is, after all, the power of =\r\n*your own* focus!) to grant a specific desire of someone, he may just do it=\r\n. But that makes him weaker and who knows whether the desire was worthwhile=\r\n?!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Of course, when you are offering things in fire, you yourself may h=\r\nave some unnecessary desires which may slow down the spiritual progress. Bu=\r\nt, that is a necessary evil and there is no escape. But, why let someone el=\r\nse&#39;s desires cause an extra slow down?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Thus, this is not a matter of p=\r\nolitical correctness and being nice.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;However, there is already a lot o=\r\nf karmic intermixing between people very closely connected to one karmicall=\r\ny, like wife, children and parents. Wife&#39;s desires may affect husband&#39;s des=\r\nires and mother&#39;s desires may affect son&#39;s desires already (atleast in a cl=\r\nosely bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no significant drawba=\r\nck to allowing them to share fire.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Bottomline:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If some people are=\r\n so close to you that you want to allow their karmas and their desires to a=\r\nffect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then allow such people to =\r\noffer in your homam fire.. Even if you do not allow specifically, some clos=\r\ne people&#39;s karmas and desires may already be directly affecting your own ka=\r\nrmas and desires and hence slowing you down!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Usually, that would be im=\r\nmediate family, but you know your situation better.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;&gt;Na=\r\nrasimha\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt;&gt;&gt; Nam=\r\naste Shri Krishna Kanth,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; I am sure Narasimha meant outside of your=\r\n immediate family.

So, until you become very pure, keep working to burn your karmas and f=\r\nree yourself from the vaasanas (mental conditioning) caused by them.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; But some people use fire in the same way an idol is used. They allow=\r\n anyone to start the fire in their homam, handle the fire and make offering=\r\ns in it etc. If one who strongly identifies one&#39;s internal fire with extern=\r\nal fire does such things, it can be disastrous. However, luckily, most peop=\r\nle who follow this approach do not understand much about fire and do not ha=\r\nve a strong identification with the fire. So, fire is practically like an i=\r\ndol for them and they do not benefit from fire as much as one can.. Thus, a=\r\nllowing everyone to start or handle or making offerings into you fire can b=\r\ne inefficient at best and disastrous at worst.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; The best approa=\r\nch is: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. Only you make offerings=\r\n in it. In your mind, identify it with your own internal fire (bhootaagni) =\r\nthat burns in the subtle body. If you do this for a while, a strong bond is=\r\n indeed formed. Without your knowledge, the internal fire will become stron=\r\ng and burn various vaasanas.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) There are different methods f=\r\nor beeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usual=\r\nly standard.. Do not worry about these things and do what you are used to o=\r\nr what you are more attracted to.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; As I said many times, these =\r\nnyaasas are just formality for most people. Placing a letter in a particula=\r\nr body part has a higher significance than just touching a body part and sa=\r\nying the letter.. Visualizing a specific body part vibrating with a specifi=\r\nc sound is possible only after one makes sufficient progress in purifying o=\r\nne&#39;s subtle perception. So there is no point in discussing what is essentia=\r\nlly a formality. I can tell you that this will not block you.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n(3) They should be shown in the video.

I=\r\n am a Palaghat Iyer and on other ocassions when we had a namboothiri perfor=\r\nm the homam he would light the homam fire himself. \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; My question is =\r\nwhether I can ask my wife to start the homam fire or do it myself ?\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) during the anganyasa and karanysa specifically the glaam beeja=\r\nm , gleem shaktih , glaum kilakam mantraas/mudras , I used to touch the hea=\r\nrt , then right and left breasts respectively whereas in the video you have=\r\n shown it to be heart , navel and below respctively. Is the beejam , shakth=\r\nih and kilakam mudras /mantrams differnet for each diety ? \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; 3) There are 4 more avhana mudras for suprIto bhava,suprasanno bhava, var=\r\nado bhava, sarvAbhIshTaprado bhava.

When mind entertains the notion that it is a causal body, it indeed b=\r\necomes aware of a causal body and looks it as I. When mind finally overcome=\r\ns all such notions one after the other, it may look at the supra-cosmic bod=\r\ny (supreme cosmic being) as I. According to upanishadic understanding, ther=\r\ne is nothing other than Brahman or supreme cosmic being. Thus, expressions =\r\nlike &quot;inside me&quot;, &quot;inside you&quot; and &quot;inside him&quot; are just expressions that d=\r\nescribe false notions rather than reality.

Due to its pre-occupations, it can only focus itself on s=\r\nmall aspects of god, in a very limited way. This is like a mirror capturing=\r\n Sun in a limited way. Sun&#39;s image may be reflected on 100 mirrors in 100 w=\r\nays. One mirror may be broken and dark colored. It may reflect very little =\r\nsunlight and sun may appear broken. Like that, each mind can focus on god i=\r\nn a different way, to a different extent.

The=\r\n issue is the mind&#39;s ability to perceive and focus on god. As the mind&#39;s pr=\r\ne-occupation with other things comes down and its ability to focus on god g=\r\noes up, we say that the internal god is becoming stronger. Again, this is j=\r\nust a way of representation. In reality, god, whether you call him internal=\r\n or external, is infinite and does not become weaker or stronger. But mind =\r\ncan focus better and mind&#39;s idea of god becomes stronger. After all, a dirt=\r\ny mirror reflecting Sun may show a dirty and dull Sun at first and show a c=\r\nleaner and brighter Sun after you clean the mirror. Sun has not really beco=\r\nme cleaner or bighter. He is the same always. We can say &quot;Sun in the mirror=\r\n&quot; has become cleaner and brighter. But there is really no Sun &quot;in the&quot; mirr=\r\nor! Though we may talk about Sun in mirror 1, Sun in mirror 2,\n Sun in mirr=\r\nor 3 and the external Sun, they are all one and the same!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=\r\n=3DArial&gt;This manner of speaking about internal vs external god and talking=\r\n about strengthening internal god is used to simplify things. Bottomline is=\r\n that any visualization of god by a mind is limited by the conditioning, ab=\r\nilities and impurities of that mind. By allowing the mind to visualize god,=\r\n to the best of its ability, on a regular basis, we sharpen its ability to =\r\nvisualize god. Eventually, mind loses all other pre-occupations and becomes=\r\n fully absorbed in the infinite god. Then we say that internal god has beco=\r\nme infinite.

They were chanting Sree Rudram 11 times. A person =\r\nwho worships Mahaalakshmi was sitting in a corner of the room. He started t=\r\no meditate with Savitru Gayatri mantra, his favorite mantra. Whichever mant=\r\nra or deity he worships, he always considers everything to be an offering t=\r\no Mahalakshmi and imagines only her as receiving the mantra. Here also, he =\r\nwas visualizing Mahalakshmi as filling his entire being and was offering Ga=\r\nyatri mantra to her. After a while, his Kundalini rose and his self-awarene=\r\nss was modified. He lost the regular awareness of body, perceived an all-pe=\r\nrvading light that he was part of and remained in a nice spiritual state fo=\r\nr a while. When he came back and the pooja was finished, one of the priests=\r\n described something unusual that he &quot;saw&quot;. In the middle of the pooja, tha=\r\nt priest turned towards this person\n and was surprised by what he saw. He s=\r\naw a tall&nbsp;18-handed form of Mahalakshmi standing in&nbsp;the place of =\r\nthis person for a little while.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT si=\r\nze=3D2&gt;As that person meditated, his&nbsp;senses turned inward and he was l=\r\nooking internally. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshmi, who filled his ent=\r\nire being in his visualization. As Kundalini rose, his distinction of inter=\r\nnal and external blurred and he perceived himself as *a part* of all-pervad=\r\ning light (it is neither &quot;internal&quot; nor &quot;external&quot;). He basically perceived=\r\n Mahaalakshmi as the all-pervading light that he was also a part of. Howeve=\r\nr, the priest who happened to look at him at that time was also in a purifi=\r\ned state and so he noticed something. His mental conditioning at that time&=\r\nnbsp;made him see a specific&nbsp;external form rather than an all-pervadin=\r\ng form. But both the priest and the person perceived the same entity in two=\r\n different ways. One was external and limited. The other was neither intern=\r\nal nor external (but obtained by looking internally at first) and unlimited=\r\n. But, both are the same. They appeared\n different to two minds because of =\r\nthe conditioning of those minds rather than anything else, just as the same=\r\n Sun may appear different in two different mirrors!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fa=\r\nce=3DArial&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;No amount of theorization will help one fully understand a=\r\nnd appreciate things like this.

Though there is actually in=\r\nfinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation with so many other things l=\r\nimits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can focus on, access and perc=\r\neive.

My questions is, is this where all d=\r\neities reside(inside) ? I mean if I am focusing on Mahaganapati, am I just =\r\nbringing out the energy of Mahaganapati from inside me or is there one sing=\r\nle, universal, omnipotent divinty called Mahaganapati who exists in the uni=\r\nverse, and I am trying to invite him into the fire?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=\r\n=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I remember a line from Vimalanan=\r\nda where he says, initially we create the deity in the astral body&nbsp;so =\r\nthat this deity (the one we projected)&nbsp;&lt;EM&gt;may &lt;/EM&gt;lead us to the rea=\r\nl deity who exists outside in the universe.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=\r\n=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Did I understand the procedure correct?

Will you allow someone who cooks terribly to cook? Why=\r\n not allow him to &quot;serve god&quot;?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is not just about &quot;serving god&quot;, b=\r\nut serving god *well*. A purified servant of god serves god with single-min=\r\nded focus and devotion and has no other thoughts in mind when serving god. =\r\nA more normal person may think various things in mind even when serving god=\r\n. There is some self-centeredness and ego even in serving god.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The g=\r\nod in your homam fire is not an external god, but your own internal god. Th=\r\nrough your mental focus, you are projecting the limited manifestation of go=\r\nd inside you into fire and honing your ability to focus the mind on that go=\r\nd. I want to clarify one thing here.. Though there is actually infinite div=\r\ninity inside you, your pre-occupation with so many other things limits (or =\r\nzeroes) the divinity that your\n mind can focus on, access and perceive. By =\r\nfocusing on it more and more, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to project=\r\n it for focusing better. On practice, the divinity inside you that you can =\r\nfocus on and perceive grows with time. Thus, remember that what is in fire =\r\nis the limited manifestation of god inside you that you are able to focus, =\r\nacces and perceive. This limited divinity should be nurtured slowly and all=\r\nowed to grow, rather than used up for unnecessary things. When this divinit=\r\ny grows and becomes infinite, all your desires and other thoughts will vani=\r\nsh and you will be able to single-mindedly focus on that divinity. Some pre=\r\ncautions will help you in the journey.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Karmas and thoughts of people=\r\n who are making offerings in your homam fire are basically being received i=\r\nn your internal god. If he has enough power (his power is, after all, the p=\r\nower of *your own* focus!) to grant a specific desire of someone, he may ju=\r\nst do it. But that makes\n him weaker and who knows whether the desire was w=\r\northwhile?!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Of course, when you are offering things in fire, you you=\r\nrself may have some unnecessary desires which may slow down the spiritual p=\r\nrogress. But, that is a necessary evil and there is no escape. But, why let=\r\n someone else&#39;s desires cause an extra slow down?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, this is not =\r\na matter of political correctness and being nice.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, there is =\r\nalready a lot of karmic intermixing between people very closely connected t=\r\no one karmically, like wife, children and parents. Wife&#39;s desires may affec=\r\nt husband&#39;s desires and mother&#39;s desires may affect son&#39;s desires already (=\r\natleast in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no sig=\r\nnificant drawback to allowing them to share fire.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;If some people are so close to you that you want to allow their karmas and=\r\n their desires to affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then al=\r\nlow such people to\n offer in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow spec=\r\nifically, some close people&#39;s karmas and desires may already be directly af=\r\nfecting your own karmas and desires and hence slowing you down!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Usua=\r\nlly, that would be immediate family, but you know your situation better.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://in.mc85.mail...yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dnarayan.iyer%40gmail.com&quot; r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Namaste Shri Krishna Kanth,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am sure Narasimha meant o=\r\nutside of your immediate family.

What this namboodiri did is the correct way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; Visualize the external fire as your internal fire and worship i=\r\nt. Then offerings in it will kindle your internal fire and streamline it, d=\r\nepending on how strong your identification is (it will get stronger with pr=\r\nactice). If anyone handles that external fire or makes offerings in it, som=\r\ne karmas will be submitted by that person to your internal fire for burning=\r\n. This intermingling of karmas can be allowed for people whose karmas are a=\r\nnyway intertwined, like husband and wife or parents and children. Of\n cours=\r\ne, you can also take on karmas from the entire world if you are ready and w=\r\nilling to face their consequences, but a person with a strong individualize=\r\nd ego should limit the karmas one faces and work on erasing that ego. When =\r\none&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may be possible to take on more karmas an=\r\nd face their consequences. After all, if you start plucking leaves, flowers=\r\n and fruits from a small plant, it will die. If you guard it and let it gro=\r\nw very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; big, it can give flowers and fruits to many more people=\r\n. So, until you become very pure, keep working to burn your karmas and free=\r\n yourself from the vaasanas (mental conditioning) caused by them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But some people use fire in the same way an idol is used.=\r\n They allow anyone to start the fire in their homam, handle the fire and ma=\r\nke offerings in it etc. If one who strongly identifies one&#39;s internal fire =\r\nwith external fire does such things, it can be disastrous.\n However, luckil=\r\ny, most people who follow this approach do not understand much about fire a=\r\nnd do not have a strong identification with the fire. So, fire is practical=\r\nly like an idol for them and they do not benefit from fire as much as one c=\r\nan.. Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or making offerings into yo=\r\nu fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at worst.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The best approach is: You start your own fire. Only you handle i=\r\nt. Only you make offerings in it. In your mind, identify it with your own i=\r\nnternal fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body. If you do this for=\r\n a while, a strong bond is indeed formed. Without your knowledge, the inter=\r\nnal fire will become strong and burn various vaasanas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; (2) There are different methods for beeja, shakti and keelakam, thou=\r\ngh anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usually standard.. Do not worry about th=\r\nese things and do what you are used to or what you\n are more attracted to.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As I said many times, these nyaasas are just for=\r\nmality for most people. Placing a letter in a particular body part has a hi=\r\ngher significance than just touching a body part and saying the letter.. Vi=\r\nsualizing a specific body part vibrating with a specific sound is possible =\r\nonly after one makes sufficient progress in purifying one&#39;s subtle percepti=\r\non. So there is no point in discussing what is essentially a formality.
