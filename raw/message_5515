You cannot take one specific line about the importa=\r\nnce of devotion out of context and portray the greatest and most prolific s=\r\ncholar of Kali yuga in an anti-scholarship light.\n\n* * *\n\nSanskrit is a ver=\r\ny useful language. So much great literature that shows various paths to rea=\r\nching god is available in Sanskrit language. Many Sanskrit mantras directly=\r\n resonate with the energy centers in one&#39;s subtle consciousness. So, if one=\r\n wants to learn Sanskrit or study various scriptures/classics in Sanskrit, =\r\nit is a great idea.\n\nAt the same time, Shankara&#39;s advice of chanting the na=\r\nme of Govinda as grammar and other technicalities do not rescue one in the =\r\nfinal moments, is a wise one. Devotion to personal god or *complete* surren=\r\nder to personal or impersonal god is the thing that saves one in the end. L=\r\nearning various shastras, performing various rituals, disciplining the mind=\r\n with various activities, keeping the company of the saintly - all these ar=\r\ne for the purpose of increasing devotion and surrender. Depending on one&#39;s =\r\nrinas and conditioning, one is bound to engage in various activities, such =\r\nas learning Sanskrit, studying scriptures, saying prayers, doing rituals et=\r\nc. But, masters like Shankara remind one of the final goal, so that people =\r\ndo not forget it and get bogged down.\n\nIf one wanting to climb a mountain k=\r\neeps walking around the mountain to find the best path to climb, one may ev=\r\nentually forget that the goal is to climb the mountain and be stuck at the =\r\nbase forever. Similarly, one who keeps learning this and that forever may f=\r\norget that reaching god is the final goal and get stuck. So compassionate m=\r\nasters may sometimes remind us of the final goal.\n\n* * *\n\nI am reminded of =\r\na small episode from the life of Swami Vivekananda.\n\nSwami Vivekananda said=\r\n at a San Francisco class: &quot;I am the disciple of a man who could not write =\r\nhis own name, and I am not worthy to undo his shoes. How often have I wishe=\r\nd I could take my intellect and throw it into the Ganges!&quot;\n\nStudent said, &quot;=\r\nBut, Swami, that is the part of you I like best.&quot;\n\nSwami Vivekananda said, =\r\n&quot;That is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=80=94 like I am.&quot;\n\nVivekananda w=\r\nas named so by Ramakrishna, not because he had viveka (discrimination) aris=\r\ning from a brilliant logical mind, but because TRUE viveka (discrimination)=\r\n was to arise in his mind later and he was to realize the limitations of hi=\r\ns regular viveka (discrimination of logical mind).\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; That Adi shank=\r\nara is celebrated in a relatively few quarters around the world,\n&gt; does spe=\r\nak a lot about his immaturity in disseminating his teachings in a\n&gt; useful =\r\nmanner.\n\nMaturity of a teacher is not measured by the following. And great =\r\nteachers do not care about being &quot;celebrated&quot;.\n\nIn any case, it is not true=\r\n that Adi Shankara is not well-celebrated. A significant percentage of Veda=\r\nnta scholarship of the last 2 millennia is influenced heavily by Adi Shanka=\r\nra&#39;s commentaries. He shaped the thinking of Indian philosophers for many m=\r\nany generations.\n\nApart from his scholarly works, the mutts established by =\r\nhim have shaped the religious consciousness of a significant percentage of =\r\nHindus in the last couple of millennia.\n\nAny teachings in written/spoken wo=\r\nrds can never be perfect and perish quickly. The words of great great teach=\r\ners also lose their meaning and relevance very quickly. Only the teachings =\r\nof rishis and gods retain their meaning and their ability to influence the =\r\nthinking of people forever (or for really long periods). Adi Shankara&#39;s wor=\r\nds - scholarly works as well as composed prayers - have retained their mean=\r\ning and power for more than a couple of millennia. The longevity of his wor=\r\nks is amazing.\n\n* * *\n\nIt is ok to have strong opinions. As people&#39;s unders=\r\ntanding evolves, their opinions evolve too. So, wise ones try not to offend=\r\n others with their strong opinions. In any case, insulting saints, avataras=\r\n of gods and rishis, based on half-baked understanding of their teachings, =\r\nis not good karma.

So, wise ones try not to offend others with t=\r\nheir strong opinions. In any case, insulting saints, avataras of gods and r=\r\nishis, based on half-baked understanding of their teachings, is not good ka=\r\nrma.

It is because the Beeja vibrations resonate wi=\r\nth the astral centers. The secret lies in choosing the right beeja for the =\r\nrecitation of mantras and commune with divinities of the creation. There is=\r\n only one right beeja for one person, amongst the 49 beejakshara\n from HaM =\r\nto SaM constituting 49 Maruts or astral-life currents, that allows a person=\r\n to contact the divinities.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is always useful to progress=\r\n on the most reasonable path of ones&#39; own choosing because that would safeg=\r\nuard one from failures and pitfalls created by others&#39; immature advice.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; That Adi shankara is celebrated in a relatively few quarters around th=\r\ne world, does speak a lot about his immaturity in disseminating his teachin=\r\ngs in a useful manner.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; There are people who are stupid enou=\r\ngh to call the Path/Goal of others as wrong, without trying to understand w=\r\nhy they are on that path in the first place. It is important to safeguard o=\r\nneself from these people, who act as leaders to an emaciated (spiritually, =\r\nmentally) following, because they feed their following on words &amp; preac=\r\nhings rather than Action and Knowledge.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is always useful=\r\n to stand apart from the herd mentality on yahoogroups,\n because that would=\r\n allow one to see farther than the group and move towards Vedas i.e. a univ=\r\nersal approach to evolution.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; You are on a better path study=\r\ning and enjoying sanksrit, as a Vedanga, however, sanskrit is only a tool t=\r\nhat should be used as a language of mantras for resonating ones&#39; being with=\r\n the 27 divinities enumerated in Jyotish (another Vedanga) as the Devas of =\r\n27 Nakshatra, in accordance with the &quot;Rules of Worship&quot; set by RigVeda.
