Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Aurobindo need n=\r\not be talking about a single &quot;savior&quot; the way people may imagine. Also, he =\r\nneed not be talking about somebody &quot;connected to&quot; his ashram. Moreover, whe=\r\nn it comes to great lineages, there are connections between all. For exampl=\r\ne, Aurobindo used to visit the house of Sister Nivedita, the foremost disci=\r\nple of Swami Vivekananda and knew her well when he still lived in Calcutta.=\r\n He had a vision in his prison cell of Swami Vivekananda, just a few years =\r\nafter his death, in which he imparted Aurobindo some key knowledge. Paramah=\r\namsa Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and learnt Sanskrit from M, who was a si=\r\nshya of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel of Ramakrishna. Trilinga Swami sen=\r\nt a tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to expand his knowledge. Trilinga Swami k=\r\nnew Lahiri mahashaya and admired him. And so on.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Coming back to the m=\r\nain point, the supermind established in the field of earth that was referre=\r\nd to by Aurobindo can simply be a maharshi paying some attention to matters=\r\n on earth. A maharshi absorbed in the divine in one of the higher planes of=\r\n consciousness can accomplish huge changes on earth by the mere power of hi=\r\ns thought. If there is a divine play to make some positive changes on earth=\r\n and a maharshi takes part in the play, he may focus a small part of his su=\r\npermind on the affairs of earth and direct a few important souls to do some=\r\n key work. Some important souls (deities, rishis or yogis etc) may send the=\r\nir amshas (partial essence) to be born on earth to fulfil different parts o=\r\nf a divine play.\n&gt;  \n&gt; You may then see several (not just one) elevated bei=\r\nngs, enlightened beings and realized beings born on earth to bring clarity =\r\nin different aspects of spiritual knowledge. Each of them will get specific=\r\n internal/external guidance from the divine, based on what their part in th=\r\ne play is.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The &quot;Asura of Falsehood&quot; that Au=\r\nrobindo alluded to is all around us. At the subtlest level, he manifests as=\r\n false ego in pretty much everybody. At the grossest level, he manifests as=\r\n blatant lies, wrong propaganda etc.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One should not tolerate this Asu=\r\nra (demon) and fight hard. However, one should not hate this Asura or those=\r\n afflicted by him. When we encounter lies, we should fight and stand for tr=\r\nuth but not hate the liar at the same time. There is nothing that needs to =\r\nbe hated in this world. One should learn to do the job assigned to one by N=\r\nature without attraction or repulsion to anything or anybody and with uncon=\r\nditional love (i.e. no expectations of a return) to all.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; This was a=\r\n very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; says about changes =\r\ncoming in the world.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I know very little. But I was told that an age t=\r\nhat is somewhat like the bygone ages will be established on earth for a few=\r\n hundred years in the coming decades. The reason the Divine Mother appeared=\r\n before Manish and asked him to spread simple homam procedures in the world=\r\n was to prepare the grounds for that. Manish also told me that all this is =\r\nthe play of a senior maharshi.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam=\r\n Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yoursel=\r\nf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.h=\r\nome.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; =\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Laxmi Narayan \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom=\r\n@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, June 21, 2009 6:50 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: =\r\n[vedic-wisdom] Descent of the Supramenal Conscinousness\n&gt;    \n&gt;         Hi,=\r\n Some time back I saw  similar article and was intrigued by it.

I am posting=\r\n it here for anyone interested.\n&gt; \n&gt;                 Near the beginning of =\r\nthe 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobi=\r\nndo, began to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In his h=\r\nigh states of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in=\r\n the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right her=\r\ne on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life was =\r\nnow. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a br=\r\neakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body towar=\r\nds this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n&gt;                 =EF=BF=BD\n&gt;           =\r\n      Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, M=\r\nirra Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother. Together they embarked =\r\non a journey of intensive cellular transformation that is very relevant to =\r\nthe colossal uncertainties we face today.\n&gt;                 =EF=BF=BD\n&gt;    =\r\n             Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matter, =\r\nand that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process of =\r\nthe divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The pro=\r\ncess by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called evolu=\r\ntion. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where these =\r\ntwo events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he fores=\r\naw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BD=\r\nsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change =\r\neverything on Earth.\n&gt;                 =EF=BF=BD\n&gt;                 Man=EF=\r\n=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he =\r\nmakes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom ac=\r\ntive in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstr=\r\nucted from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is=\r\n a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses se=\r\nems to contradict it.\n&gt; \n&gt;                 Sri Aurobindo recognized that hu=\r\nmankind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reached i=\r\nn which the human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, but is =\r\nleft hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species. Mean=\r\nwhile, as the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a consciousness hi=\r\ngher than the human rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind, has re=\r\ncently been established in the fields of the Earth, and is active there. Ou=\r\nr task now is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.\n&gt; \n&gt;           =\r\n      Evolution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and lat=\r\ner with the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap =\r\nforward, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Superm=\r\nind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we wi=\r\nll soon be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=\r\n=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessi=\r\nng an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and mergi=\r\nng with it.\n&gt;                 =EF=BF=BD\n&gt;                 Next is the =EF=\r\n=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous-ly coming to birt=\r\nh under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being that =\r\nis largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than mind-=\r\nconsciousness. \n&gt; \n&gt;                 Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=\r\n=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will be in possession=\r\n of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness that has begun to=\r\n merge with cellular consciousness. \n&gt; \n&gt;                 Finally, our ulti=\r\nmate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity=\r\n incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race o=\r\nf what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, =\r\nthe unity of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.\n&gt; \n&gt;    =\r\n             The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing=\r\n supramental consciousness down into the cellular consciousness of their ow=\r\nn bodies. Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant that the supram=\r\nental consciousness was simultaneously being brought into the consciousness=\r\n fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower into its ful=\r\nl manifestation in collective matter.\n&gt;                 Whenever there is a=\r\n =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo=\r\n and the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=\r\n=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is=\r\n the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and=\r\n the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, a=\r\nnd which seem to be in control of current global events. According to them =\r\nthe Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently=\r\n, and the Asura of Suffering has returned to Source, and so only the latter=\r\n two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the=\r\n Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during Worl=\r\nd War II, and of their own intensive inner work in countering his influence=\r\n. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing o=\r\nther world leaders in the current political sphere.\n&gt; \n&gt;                 Wi=\r\nth the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete hum=\r\nan structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that al=\r\nthough the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrop=\r\nhic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for t=\r\nhe most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, ca=\r\nrried a power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by mean=\r\ns other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be =\r\nabsorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. =\r\nIt may be interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world toda=\r\ny, the destruction we might have experienced if not for this power of harmo=\r\nnization!\n&gt; \n&gt;                 When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and=\r\n the Mother believed that the world stage was set for this quantum descent,=\r\n and that it was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the suprament=\r\nal transformation was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a =\r\nminimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerabl=\r\ne.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.\n&gt; \n&gt;     =\r\n            This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji s=\r\nays about changes coming in the world.\n&gt; \n&gt;                 -Regards\n&gt;     =\r\n             Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt;                 The upsurge (of consciousness) i=\r\ns Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
