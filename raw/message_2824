For example, one may be on =\r\n\n&gt; a bus or a train traveling to work or sitting in a conference room waiti=\r\nng \n&gt; for a conference to walking from one place to another or standing in =\r\nfront \n&gt; of the stove cooking food or eating some food or whatever. If one&#39;=\r\ns *mind* \n&gt; has a little *free time*, irrespective what the body is doing, =\r\none can chant \n&gt; one&#39;s mantra (whichever it is).\n&gt; \n&gt; Sitting in one place =\r\nand doing japa with some rules is definitely better, \n&gt; but, one can *suppl=\r\nement* such sadhana with chanting the mantra while \n&gt; walking or sitting in=\r\n a train etc, which is also good. It is better than \n&gt; mind wandering here =\r\nand there and gossipping about this and that. Use the \n&gt; mantra as a tool t=\r\no stop the mind from wandering and to focus it on god.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;=\r\n Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do=\r\n Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP=\r\n3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJa=\r\ngannath.org\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----- \n&gt; \n\n\n\n"}}
