(She says, you already made a choice. It is just th=\r\nat you need to realise your choice).\n\nOur problem is that we try to assume =\r\nonly one of the contradicting things are possible.\n\nLooking at analogy pres=\r\nented by Narasimha, future may indeed may have happened. How ever, who said=\r\n there can only be one future?\nThere may be multiple versions of the same m=\r\novie (one for US, one for India, one for Tamil, one for Telugu etc.). Our f=\r\nreewill may let us decide which movie you are going to see.\n\nA learned pers=\r\non may know what will happen if you use our free will in a specific know.\n\n=\r\nThe eventual question now is can a saintly person foresee with confidence o=\r\nf how I will excersize my freewill (he can perhaps foresee what will happen=\r\n if I choose to excersize my freewill in a particular way. But, does he alr=\r\neady know how I will excersize it)?\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Naras=\r\nimhaji\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; No doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail for all of us, howev=\r\ner, I could not help it that an inevitable question popped up in my mind. O=\r\nne of the oft discussed and eternal questions.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; If events have alrea=\r\ndy been created like in a movie and later as time unfolds, they happen in o=\r\nur plane of existence, then all talk of freewill must be humbug?

Both cannot be correct. It is either this or that.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The=\r\noritically speaking, say tomorrow suddenly majority of the world reforms it=\r\nself, does a self correction exercise and brings in peace, harmony etc etc,=\r\n then why should the Kalki Avatar still incarnate?

He did not know much about=\r\n some of the ten incarnations. He described what he saw and I told him who =\r\nwas who and a little about them. One of the forms he saw was a radiant man =\r\nwith white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I told him he was =\r\nKalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; This boy is usually playful, =\r\neasy-going and smiling. But, when I was with him one morning, I saw him los=\r\nt in some serious thought. This was abou a week after the episode mentioned=\r\n in the above mail.\n&gt; \n&gt; I asked what he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not =\r\nthat the future that is to come has not already happened. It has already ha=\r\nppened in reality, but it will happen later when the time comes. You know w=\r\nhat I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, but pretended not to know. I=\r\n said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what =\r\nI am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known to be overly intelligent or articulat=\r\ne. His main characteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, =\r\nkind, contented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But he c=\r\nould not express himself.\n&gt; \n&gt; I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that futur=\r\ne has already happened at some level, but will reveal itself to people late=\r\nr? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a s=\r\ntudio. Some people may have already seen it. But people seeing it on the sc=\r\nreen later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you saying some=\r\nthing like that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If=\r\n something is going to happen in future, it will happen when future comes. =\r\nBut somebody may be able to see it before future comes, because it has alre=\r\nady happened.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinkin=\r\ng along these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his vision=\r\n over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably confused. =\r\nGiven his age and ability to think and understand things, this probably see=\r\nmed like an oddity to him that he should see somebody who had not yet come.=\r\n So he was trying to think how it was possible and came to some important c=\r\nonclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Time seems linear at the level=\r\n of regular consciousness. However, in many planes of conssciousness, the c=\r\noncept of time becomes changed. It even loses its meaning when one is estab=\r\nlished in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The same boy =\r\nonce performed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama mantra of Dakshi=\r\nna Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When we were meditating after=\r\n poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. It was quite diffe=\r\nrent from the energy I feel normally. This intense energy made my mind feel=\r\n satisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in word=\r\ns as &quot;I am done here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled=\r\n my entire consciousnss.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had experienced the same kind of intense en=\r\nergy twice before that. Once I experienced the same energy when I was medit=\r\nating sitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India.=\r\n Second time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside th=\r\ne garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Kaal=\r\ni idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the p=\r\nast. The energy I felt was the same on all the three occasions. At no other=\r\n time did I feel that intense shakti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Interestingly, after we finished=\r\n meditation and opened eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different h=\r\nomas I did so far, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I=\r\n don&#39;t know how to say it, but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; * =\r\n* *\n&gt; \n&gt; This boy performed a really simple and short procedure, shorter th=\r\nan what I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful in making a=\r\n powerful energy manifest there. The bottomline is that internal purity is =\r\nthe most important thing.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps one=\r\n do a ritual better and get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken proble=\r\nm and one has to keep doing it until one breaks through.\n&gt; \n&gt; Keep performi=\r\nng your chosen spiritual practices, but do pay attention to internal purity=\r\n as you engage in external practices. The only worthwhile measure of spirit=\r\nual progress and purity is how smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes sma=\r\nller, you can resist attraction to external things better and you can resis=\r\nt internal enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dh=\r\narma better. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the ro=\r\not cause of all problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga =\r\nis relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that i=\r\ns around you - including your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your=\r\n own body - is god&#39;s property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all=\r\n of these properties of god. Do the best job you can, but without entertain=\r\ning the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care of h=\r\nis master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all those things as his or =\r\nher belongings.\n&gt; \n&gt; Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not neces=\r\nsary for taking good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes t=\r\nhe best care of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a serv=\r\nant does not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept that is =\r\nmaster&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. This enables one to do the=\r\n best job with what one possesses and not worry about what one does not pos=\r\nsess or what is out of one&#39;s control.\n&gt; \n&gt; Developing the attitude of a ser=\r\nvant who takes care of master&#39;s properties will help one wade the ocean of =\r\nworldly life without getting caught and overcome ego.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; =\r\nNarasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n-\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do =\r\nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons=\r\n (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windo=\r\nws): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: =\r\nhttp://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- - \n&gt; \n&gt;       ICC World Twenty20 England &#39;09 exclusi=\r\nvely on YAHOO!
