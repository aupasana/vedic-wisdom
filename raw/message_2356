Do \nnot accept something unless you understand and *digest* it. Accumulating a \nlot of undigested knowledge causes problems later, just as accumulating a \nlot of undigested food in one&#39;s stomach does.\n\nAt the same time, be mindful of the fact that a spiritual giant&#39;s view may \nbe unpalatable to you because of your own limitations, i.e. you may be \nmissing something. Give the benefit of doubt and try to understand \nrespectfully.\n\nOf course, when it comes to factual inaccuracies, it is a different matter. \nIf you know for sure that something a spiritual giant said was a factual \ninaccuracy, you can of course dismiss and ignore it.\n\nAn active man like Vivekananda, who accomplished so much in a life of 39 \nyears, may sometimes use wrong facts at his disposal based on the \nunderstanding at his time, to advocate what he wanted to advocate. But, \nblessed jnaanis and karma yogis like Vivekananda or Aurobindo would often \nend up advocating correct views even if they use wrong facts occasionally to \nsupport their views.\n\nIf I am not mistakened, the current temple at Puri was built around 1000 AD \nor so. I am not sure of what existed in that specific place before.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, August 26, 2009 7:58 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Swami Vivekananda says women must grow in the \nfootprints of Sita\n\n\n&gt; Namaste Amit and Rajarshi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I remember having read the book called &quot;Bharatiya Nari&quot; (Translated \n&gt; version of Vivekananda&#39;s work on Indian women&quot;. The subject matter is the \n&gt; part of that book.\n&gt;\n&gt; Honestly, though i adore vivekananda so much, found it very hard to \n&gt; understand the statements. there are few other quotes in the same book \n&gt; which i could not reconcile with.\n&gt;\n&gt; Only possible answer to such thing is - &quot;Take everything with pinch of \n&gt; salt&quot;. As Narasimha Says - Everybody (Even Ramakrishna himself) can be \n&gt; deluded by Mahaamaaya!!! she is the ultimate authority in the realm of \n&gt; Dualistic world and capable of deluding everybody.\n&gt;\n&gt; so as Rajarshi has said, Think for your self. if something is not \n&gt; digestable, don&#39;t be sycophant to accept it - don&#39;t force you mind to \n&gt; accept it just because they are the words from the mouth of saintly \n&gt; authority.\n&gt;\n&gt; best reagards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Samir Shah &lt;solaris.smoke@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I think you make a very good point. You&#39;ve raised something that has\n&gt;&gt; made me stop to think many times. It seems to me that Swami Vivekananda\n&gt;&gt; made many statements - especially about Hinduism and India - that could\n&gt;&gt; be construed to be disparaging of other religions and cultures, and that\n&gt;&gt; to me at least seemed a little unwarranted.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Whether this can be put down simply to naivete, or whether it served\n&gt;&gt; some purpose which we do not see, and is now taken out of context, I\n&gt;&gt; don&#39;t know. In either case I have yet to reconcile those statements with\n&gt;&gt; the rest of his teachings.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kind regards,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Samir\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On 25/08/2009 11:46, rajarshi nandy wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; /To any man who knows anything about Indian history, that very \n&gt;&gt; &gt; statement\n&gt;&gt; &gt; proves that the whole thing was a fraud, because the temple of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Jagannath\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is an old Buddhistic temple. We took this and others over and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; re-Hinduised them. /\n&gt;&gt; &gt; //\n&gt;&gt; &gt; With all due respect to the great man that Swamiji was, he was possibly\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not aware what kind of effects an ill-researched statement may have in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; future.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; That statement above is very controvertial and possibly incorrect. But\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the fact that it comes from Vivekananda, often people may consider it \n&gt;&gt; &gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; be sacroscant and land up with wrong conclusions. Without a doubt,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Swamiji was a spiritual Giant, but he was not a historian. He naively\n&gt;&gt; &gt; accepted most of the ideas about Indian history as propagated by \n&gt;&gt; &gt; western\n&gt;&gt; &gt; scholars.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Therefore, my advise, read lots and form your /own /opinions. When it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; comes to aspects of /materialistic/ knowledge, NOTHING and NO ONE is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; beyond questioning.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt;&gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
