I have a feeling these things are happen=\r\ning because of reading the mantras and various good topics discussed here i=\r\nn this forum.\n\n\nI would like to thank one and all, who are contributing to =\r\nthese forums, and I promise to one and all, I would contribute these good t=\r\no all the people whom I new and try to help in what ever way i could.\n\n\ntha=\r\nnk you,\n\nRegards,\nVishal.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;chaudhuri.=\r\nkrishnendu&quot; &lt;krishnenduchdhr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Vishal\n&gt; You can keep a p=\r\nicture of Manish Panditji in your worship altar and put it in front when yo=\r\nu are doing homam.As he by divine will the introducer of this homam wave we=\r\n can treat him as our Guru in this project.Moreover as far as I remember Ma=\r\nnishji said that he comes to know whenever anybody thinks about him(beyond =\r\nthe constraints of space and time).So your effort as i think will not be co=\r\nmpletely unaware of Manishji.\n&gt; Dedicate all good and evil not only of the =\r\nhomam but your life to Manishji.\n&gt; Practice for 6 months then come to a con=\r\nclusion and write about it here.\n&gt; You can find a picture of Manishji in th=\r\ne files section.You can digitally print that picture and frame it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, vishal nagulapalli &lt;vis_hyds@&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Biswas ji,\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Thank you for your, encouragement.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Do I have to take the permission and guidance of Gurujans.
