They are the same.\n \nHowever, *normally* people who think they are pursuing the two ends tend to walk two different paths. But, if they reach the absolute end, they will be in the same state. I will elaborate.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSome Adwaitins who pursue self-realization emphasize on jnaana (correct knowledge). If one defines Self as the uncreated and indestructible essence, one can look at one thing after another (e.g. body, senses, buddhi etc) and realize &quot;that is not Self, this is not Self&quot; etc. As one keeps eliminating one thing after another through discrimination and detaches the mind from whatever has been found to be not Self, finally one&#39;s mind is absorbed in the Self, which is without any attributes and which is not created or destroyed.\n \nIt is very difficult in this age to realize Self in this manner. Realizing through discrimination that so and so thing is not Self, as it is created and destructible, is not too difficult, but to disengage the mind from all such things with discipline is not at all easy. Pure jnaana maarga is unsuitable for most people today.\n \nMoreover, Vasishtha says in &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; that knowledge and action are the two wings with which the bird of soul flies. One following jnaana maarga needs to engage in correct actions to realize Self. Followers of jnaana maarga who are slaves of inactions may never realize Self. Actions without correct knowledge bind one, but actions performed with correct knowledge (i.e. without a sense of doership) free one from one previous karma after another and prepare one for Self-realization.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThose who seek god-realization normally emphasize on bhakti (devotion). If one defines God as the all-pervading one who is uncreated and indestructible, one can look at everything as god. As one starts seeing god in everything, one overcomes one&#39;s attractions and repulsions to various things and achieves an equanimous state of mind. When such an equanimous mind stops seeing all the people and things, and gets established in the uncreated, indestructible and all-pervading god present in all, we say that one is absorbed in God.\n \nOne yogi&#39;s mind may be absorbed in a god with various specific attributes and there may be a notion in his mind of various people and things in the universe apart from that god. That is a spiritual realization too, but not the highest. When one realizes the god one is devoted to as the Supreme Cosmic Being who is not colored by any specific attributes and yet has all possible attributes and when one&#39;s mind is devoid of any other notions or objects and filled with *just* that Supreme Cosmic Being, that is the highest god-realization.\n \nThis is not really different from Self-realization of an jnaani. In both, mind is absorbed in something infinite, uncreated, indestructible and uncolored by any specific attributes.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf you have &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; (Swami Venkatesananda&#39;s translation titled &quot;Vasishtha&#39;s Yoga&quot; is very good), read the story of Vitahavya (I think). Maharshi Vasishtha describes how his mind rose above one thing after another and how he was finally established in the Turiya state. Vasishtha says that the state beyond attributes and qualifications that he was established in is variously known as Self or Aatman or Brahman or Iswara or Supreme Cosmic Being by various groups of people. He equates all the terms!\n \n*        *        *\n \nOne can mix jnaana yoga, bhakti yoga, karma yoga and raaja yoga and carve one&#39;s own niche. Whatever we do, we have to rise above the limited ego. Mind attaches itself to a body and name and thinks &quot;this is I and the most important&quot;. The true &quot;I&quot; (which is uncreated and indestructible, unlike the body and name) is realized only when the fake &quot;I&quot; is *completely* given up. It does not happen in an instant. Rome is not built in a day!\n \nA good old-fashioned guru can help one progress faster by tearing down one&#39;s ego with strenuous testing, but that does not happen to all. Moreover, all may not be able to withstand it. So, progress at your own speed, but do avail all options. Contemplation and discriminination (from jnaana yoga) can help in overcoming ego. Devotion, surrender and humility (from bhakti yoga) can help in overcoming ego. Sincerity, selflessness, thinking of others more than oneself and freedom from expectation of results (from karma yoga) can help in overcoming ego. Fearlessness (even of death) and equanimous vision (from raaja yoga) can also help in overcoming ego, even though it is a risky approach.\n \nCarve your own path, with help from your guru, but be sincere in following your path. No effort is wasted. It will give results sooner or later.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt;  \n&gt; What is the difference between self realization and God realization?
