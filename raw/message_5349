Human body is natural=\r\nly suited for an omnivorous diet. Just like \n\n&gt; people do not eat raw meat,=\r\n normally, people do not eat raw vegetables as well. \n\n&gt; Cooking is a later=\r\n addition to human society. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; If you were to clear your mind of a=\r\nll preconcieved ideas and look at REAL \n\n&gt; research in the most unbiased wa=\r\ny possible, and accessed scientific papers in \n\n&gt; clinical nutrition and di=\r\netetics, as latest as 2010 june/july, you would find \n\n&gt; ample evidence tha=\r\nt humans as a speicies, for many milleniums have relied on an \n\n&gt; omnivorou=\r\ns diet:-\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; a) Human ancestral diets changed substantially approximatel=\r\ny four to five \n\n&gt; million years ago with major climatic changes creating o=\r\npen grassland \n\n&gt; environments. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; b) Humans developed a larger br=\r\nain balanced by a smaller, simpler \n\n&gt; gastrointestinal tract=C3=82=C2=A0 r=\r\nequiring=C3=82=C2=A0foods based around meat protein and fat. For \n\n&gt; exampl=\r\ne since the time of Australopithecus afarensis, some four to five million \n=\r\n\n&gt; years ago, brain size has increased threefold - chemical requirement for=\r\n \n\n&gt; long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain - without a =\r\n\n\n&gt; corresponding increase in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is possible on=\r\nly with a \n\n&gt; diet that is rich is animal protein. Simply put, in layman te=\r\nrms, our brain \n\n&gt; would not have reached the size and mass as it is today,=\r\n had it not been for \n\n&gt; diet comprising of meat, fruits and vegetables. \n\n=\r\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; c) The gut morphology of the human body as it stand todays is ide=\r\nally \n\n&gt; equidistant from that of carnivores as well as herbivores. That is=\r\n because \n\n&gt; humans are designed to be omnivores. The lack of a well develo=\r\nped caecum and \n\n&gt; rumen, unlike herbivores, makes it difficult for the bod=\r\ny to absorve plant \n\n&gt; cellulose into usable energy, which is why, a=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0major part of the leafy vegetable \n\n&gt; based diet eventually ends up a=\r\ns roughage. On the other hand, the stomach lining \n\n&gt; of humans do not cont=\r\nain=C3=82=C2=A0 the kind of strong acids which is present in a typical \n\n&gt; =\r\ncarnivore. This is because, humans, diet as set by Nature through=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 the natural \n\n&gt; process of evolution is supposed to be omnivorous. It m=\r\nay further interest you \n\n&gt; to know that the teeth structure of humans is a=\r\nctually identical to, guess what, \n\n&gt; rats who also are omnivores.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; d=\r\n) It may shock many a preconcieved and mistaken ideas that=C3=82=C2=A0resea=\r\nrch into \n\n&gt; clinical nutrition very clearly indicates that absorption abil=\r\nity of the human \n\n&gt; body for=C3=82=C2=A0w.r.t different foods=C3=82=C2=A0i=\r\ns highest (not vegetables or fruits) for fish, \n\n&gt; and lowest for red meat =\r\nand carrots.

Human body is naturally suited for an omnivorous diet. =\r\nJust like &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; people do not eat raw meat, normally, people do not eat=\r\n raw vegetables as well. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Cooking is a later addition to human soc=\r\niety. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If you were to clear your mind of all p=\r\nreconcieved ideas and look at REAL &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; research in the most unbiased =\r\nway possible, and accessed scientific papers in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; clinical nutritio=\r\nn and dietetics, as latest as 2010 june/july, you would find &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ampl=\r\ne evidence that humans as a speicies, for many milleniums have relied on an=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; omnivorous diet:-&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a) Human ancestral diets ch=\r\nanged substantially approximately four to five &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; million years ago =\r\nwith major climatic changes creating open grassland &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; environments.=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; b) Humans developed a larger brain balanced =\r\nby a smaller, simpler &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; gastrointestinal tract=C3=82&nbsp; requirin=\r\ng=C3=82&nbsp;foods based around meat protein and fat. For &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; example=\r\n since the time of Australopithecus afarensis, some four to five million &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; years ago, brain size has increased threefold - chemical requiremen=\r\nt for &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain -=\r\n without a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; corresponding increase in the Basal Metabolic Rate. Th=\r\nis is possible only with a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; diet that is rich is animal protein. S=\r\nimply put, in layman terms, our brain &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; would not have reached the =\r\nsize and mass as it is today, had it not been for &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; diet comprising=\r\n of meat, fruits and vegetables. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; c) The gut m=\r\norphology of the human body as it stand todays is ideally &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; equidis=\r\ntant from that of carnivores as well as herbivores. That is because &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; humans are designed to be omnivores. The lack of a well developed caecum=\r\n and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; rumen, unlike herbivores, makes it difficult for the body to=\r\n absorve plant &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; cellulose into usable energy, which is why, a=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;major part of the leafy vegetable &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; based diet eventually =\r\nends up as roughage. On the other hand, the stomach lining &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of hum=\r\nans do not contain=C3=82&nbsp; the kind of strong acids which is present in=\r\n a typical &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; carnivore. This is because, humans, diet as set by Nat=\r\nure through=C3=82&nbsp; the natural &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; process of evolution is suppo=\r\nsed to be omnivorous. It may further interest you &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to know that th=\r\ne teeth structure of humans is actually identical to, guess what, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n rats who also are omnivores.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; d) It may shock many a pre=\r\nconcieved and mistaken ideas that=C3=82&nbsp;research into &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; clinic=\r\nal nutrition very clearly indicates that absorption ability of the human &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; body for=C3=82&nbsp;w.r.t different foods=C3=82&nbsp;is highest (no=\r\nt vegetables or fruits) for fish, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and lowest for red meat and car=\r\nrots. Infact the later is considered negative &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; calorie food, since=\r\n it requires the body to waste more calories in absorving it &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; than=\r\n the amount it gains from them. But fish is the easiet to digest. You can &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; look up actual BV (biological value)=C3=82&nbsp;charts for more de=\r\ntails.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; All this is science.

I have not studied biolo=\r\ngy &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;or chemistry.

So not only hear=\r\nt that is affected in non veg &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;eaters but also sexual reproduc=\r\ntion system. this is surprising since non veg &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;foods are suppo=\r\nsed to make men more rajasic and active. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;2) for the last 10 years at least the chemicals are being used incr=\r\neasingly to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;make the animals more heavier and tasty after coo=\r\nking. accordingly even fish, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;prawns, chickens, goats, buffalo=\r\n are all being fed with food that would make &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;them grow faster=\r\n and to make their flesh tastier.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;3) people all =\r\nover the world are ignoring such facts to their own peril.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I am a born vegetarian and i do not know the facts about non veg=\r\n foods.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Can someone explain the facts?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thanks to everyone,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Rajmohan &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n=\r\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n    =\r\n \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n--0-1839273020-1291206266=:9538--\r\n\n"}}
