Dharma often requires judging and bal=\r\nancing different criteria and the judgment may vary from place to place, ti=\r\nme to time and person to person.\n\nUncooked (raw) rice grains last a long ti=\r\nme without getting spoiled, but cooked rice grains get spoiled fast. Unfort=\r\nunately, people cannot eat raw grains. So someone cooks for them. Do not ex=\r\npect cooked grains to last a long time, even if a great cook cooked them.\n\n=\r\nSimilarly, generic and raw spiritual teachings given in scriptures and taug=\r\nht by great yogis (e.g. Brahman alone is real. World is maayaa. Do good to =\r\nothers. Sacrifice your happiness for others) are relevant always, while ver=\r\ny specific guidelines given by great yogis in specific circumstances (e.g. =\r\nIt is ok to eat fish, but focus mind on god. It is ok to do homam with must=\r\nard oil instead of ghee. If someone comes to you and asks for money, give w=\r\nhatever you have) may have been given keeping the circumstances in mind and=\r\n may be irrelevant in other circumstances.\n\nIf I reject spoiled food cooked=\r\n by my wife who is out of town and instead eat food made by my sister-in-la=\r\nw, it is not disrespectful to my wife. She would not have expected me to ha=\r\nng on to her food and eat it even after it expires.\n\nUnfortunately, many gr=\r\neat yogis give specific guidelines to people based on the circumstances (de=\r\nsa-kaala- paatra), as people are not smart enough to know the right thing i=\r\nf given only generic guidelines and want specific guidance. So they run the=\r\n risk of someone using the guideline meant for a specific circumstance in o=\r\nther inapplicable circumstances while attributing it to them.\n\n(2) Eating t=\r\nhe meat of an animal that self-identifies with the body parts strongly is a=\r\nlways a much stronger karma than eating the stuff from plants that have muc=\r\nh subtler self-identification with the leaves and vegetables they grow. Irr=\r\nespective of which spiritual giants ate fish in the past, it is bad karma.\n=\r\n\nAll of us do many bad karmas and many good karmas and hope for them balanc=\r\ne out. Vivekananda and Ramakrishna did so many good karmas, so many austeri=\r\nties and such intense spiritual sadhana. It may have offset any bad karma a=\r\nccumulated by eating fish during the time they were not yet fully realized =\r\n(after full realization, there are no karmas).\n\n(3) In the old days - even =\r\na century back - people did much more sadhana than now and lived simpler an=\r\nd purer lifestyles. Now-a-days, we live in the middle of deep pollution - p=\r\nhysical as well as spiritual - and our minds are bombarded with so much cor=\r\nrupting influence. One may do a homam in the evening, go and turn on the TV=\r\n and the sitcom coming on TV during prime time may have sexual innuendo. On=\r\ne may check email and get a spam mail about sexuality. There are images of =\r\nhalf-naked people and struggle for money everywhere. There are too many tem=\r\nptations for the mind and too many opportunities to fall and commit bad kar=\r\nmas (physically or mentally). The world of today is more challenging for a =\r\nsadhaka than at the time of Vivekananda.\n\nHow good shoes one wears may not =\r\nmatter if one is walking on a normal road in summer. One should better wear=\r\n good shoes if one is walking on an icy pavement during winter, lest one sh=\r\nould fall!\n\nWhen there is so much corrupting influence around us that we ca=\r\nnnot control and that is challenging us, we can atleast control our own act=\r\nions and habits and minimize the bad karmas we regularly commit and the cha=\r\nnce of a fall.\n\n(4) When Lord Vishnu came to earth as Lord Rama, he taught =\r\nthe importance of Eka Patni Vrata (having only one wife). When he came back=\r\n as Lord Krishna, he did not emphasize that anymore and had many wives. Whe=\r\nn he came as Lord Narasimha or Lord Rama, he killed demons. When he came as=\r\n Lord Buddha, he taught non-violence.\n\nWhen yogis like Ramakrishna, Vivekan=\r\nanda, Ramana Maharshi, Sai Baba etc come also, their message is tuned for t=\r\nheir desa-kaala-paatra. Different times require different leelas, different=\r\n missions, different messages and different styles.\n\nUnfortunately, Jaambav=\r\nanta did not recognize when Lord Rama came back as Lord Krishna and even fo=\r\nught with him!\n\n(5) While it is illogical to hold Thakur, Mother and Swamij=\r\ni accountable for the beliefs of these people, I admire their blind faith. =\r\nIf it is opportunism, i.e. they just want to eat fish and use the icons of =\r\ntheir organization as an excuse, that is bad. But, if it is genuine blind f=\r\naith that these icons were perfected beings and their words are never wrong=\r\n, they will eventually make it. Opportunistic and egoistic faith is useless=\r\n, but blind and complete faith accompanied by complete surrender is very po=\r\nwerful. People with such faith WILL find their way.\n\n(6) The nearest path f=\r\nrom Ujjain to Kashi does not go through Calcutta. But, if someone insists o=\r\nn going through Calcutta, what can you do? Everyone takes a spiritual path =\r\nbased on one&#39;s conditioning. If we see a short path, we can only suggest it=\r\n to others but nor force them to take it.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=C2=A0 F=\r\nree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourse=\r\nlf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that =\r\nmake a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spir=\r\nituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writ=\r\nings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n--- On Fri, 2/5/10,=\r\n rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: rajarshi nandy &lt;raj=\r\narshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Great Vimalananda&#39; s =\r\nopinion on &#39;Meat-eaters&#39; (Aghor -at the left hand of God)\nTo: vedic-wisdom@=\r\n yahoogroups. com\nDate: Friday, February 5, 2010, 9:38 AM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nD=\r\near KK,\n=C2=A0\nNice question.

However, you are free to addre=\r\nss me as you feel like and I&#39;ll happily accept it hence forth.\n\nI just came=\r\n across Vimalananda&#39; s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a =\r\ntimes repeated) that Karma is only generated (Binding to one) when one self=\r\n-identifies with it.\nAlthough, it may seem easy to understand intellectuall=\r\ny, the state is multiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an =\r\nextremely important statement to answer our queries.\n\nImportant information=\r\n about Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he was a big=\r\n time smoker and there was not a single day passed in his life when he didn=\r\n&#39;t do smoking except on the final day of his departure from physical body. =\r\nHe used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently and occasionally ate meat. I g=\r\nave this information, because as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it=\r\n is an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Furthe=\r\nr, please also note an important thing. The Aghori used to say very frequen=\r\ntly to all his audience to do what he says and not try to do what he does.\n=\r\n\nNow whatever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions you as=\r\nked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an =\r\nunrealized person and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take examp=\r\nle cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such =\r\nacknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are all realized=\r\n souls who achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are know=\r\ner of everything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego is pe=\r\nrfectly and completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* what th=\r\ney are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;. Relevant to our topic of discuss=\r\nion, I would say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or ki=\r\nlled animals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely=\r\n a specific purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I sai=\r\nd, they know complete background behind their each action and\n moreover the=\r\nir self identification is missing from the action and hence it is like Natu=\r\nre operates through them to accomplish a special purpose without binding th=\r\nem in any cause-effect chain.\nRamakrishna used to frequently say to all his=\r\n disciples that Naren is very different from others. He has a blazing spiri=\r\ntual fire burning within him which can consume anything and everything. A f=\r\nood restriction does not bind him. He can eat anything without getting spir=\r\nitually troubled but for others, a kind of food intake is extremely importa=\r\nnt.\nIf Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some=\r\n subtle purpose which is not possible for majority of us to comprehend unle=\r\nss explained by a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from t=\r\nhe sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as=\r\n one of them and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating a=\r\nnd such other undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that=\r\n he is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat h=\r\ne ate. It is also possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings=\r\n on the animal&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there were =\r\nno apparent reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll =\r\nnot know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Viv=\r\nekananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in I=\r\nndia and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some\n years=\r\n actually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him t=\r\no stay away from water and when he requested swami to accept him as his dis=\r\nciple, swami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and =\r\nhis guru will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man l=\r\nater became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was act=\r\nually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled wha=\r\nt swami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.\n\nSwami Vivekananda was all know=\r\ning and most of us are NOT.\n\nSo moral of my whole writings is that it&#39;s unw=\r\nise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habits o=\r\nf Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami =\r\nSamarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our completely self id=\r\nentified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal \n\n=\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@... &gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0I was about to ask this question today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 It is clear from the below passage meat eating is not advisable for any=\r\none.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I was=C3=82=C2=A0reading a book on Swami Vivekananda (Na=\r\na Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he survived many days on =\r\njust eating meat when he was living in USA also relished it.

Dharma often requires judging and balancin=\r\ng different criteria and the judgment may vary from place to place, time to=\r\n time and person to person.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Uncooked (raw) rice grains last a long t=\r\nime without getting spoiled, but cooked rice grains get spoiled fast. Unfor=\r\ntunately, people cannot eat raw grains. So someone cooks for them. Do not e=\r\nxpect cooked grains to last a long time, even if a great cook cooked them.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Similarly, generic and raw spiritual teachings given in scriptures a=\r\nnd taught by great yogis (e.g. Brahman alone is real. World is maayaa. Do g=\r\nood to others. Sacrifice your happiness for others) are relevant always, wh=\r\nile very specific guidelines given by great yogis in specific circumstances=\r\n (e.g. It is ok to eat fish, but focus mind on god. It is ok to do homam wi=\r\nth mustard oil instead of ghee. If someone comes to you and asks for money,=\r\n\n give whatever you have) may have been given keeping the circumstances in =\r\nmind and may be irrelevant in other circumstances.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If I reject spoil=\r\ned food cooked by my wife who is out of town and instead eat food made by m=\r\ny sister-in-law, it is not disrespectful to my wife. She would not have exp=\r\nected me to hang on to her food and eat it even after it expires.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Un=\r\nfortunately, many great yogis give specific guidelines to people based on t=\r\nhe circumstances (desa-kaala- paatra), as people are not smart enough to kn=\r\now the right thing if given only generic guidelines and want specific guida=\r\nnce. So they run the risk of someone using the guideline meant for a specif=\r\nic circumstance in other inapplicable circumstances while attributing it to=\r\n them.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(2) Eating the meat of an animal that self-identifies with th=\r\ne body parts strongly is always a much stronger karma than eating the stuff=\r\n from plants that have much subtler self-identification with the\n leaves an=\r\nd vegetables they grow. Irrespective of which spiritual giants ate fish in =\r\nthe past, it is bad karma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All of us do many bad karmas and many goo=\r\nd karmas and hope for them balance out. Vivekananda and Ramakrishna did so =\r\nmany good karmas, so many austerities and such intense spiritual sadhana. I=\r\nt may have offset any bad karma accumulated by eating fish during the time =\r\nthey were not yet fully realized (after full realization, there are no karm=\r\nas).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(3) In the old days - even a century back - people did much mor=\r\ne sadhana than now and lived simpler and purer lifestyles. Now-a-days, we l=\r\nive in the middle of deep pollution - physical as well as spiritual - and o=\r\nur minds are bombarded with so much corrupting influence. One may do a homa=\r\nm in the evening, go and turn on the TV and the sitcom coming on TV during =\r\nprime time may have sexual innuendo. One may check email and get a spam mai=\r\nl about sexuality. There are images of half-naked people\n and struggle for =\r\nmoney everywhere. There are too many temptations for the mind and too many =\r\nopportunities to fall and commit bad karmas (physically or mentally). The w=\r\norld of today is more challenging for a sadhaka than at the time of Vivekan=\r\nanda.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;How good shoes one wears may not matter if one is walking on a=\r\n normal road in summer. One should better wear good shoes if one is walking=\r\n on an icy pavement during winter, lest one should fall!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When there =\r\nis so much corrupting influence around us that we cannot control and that i=\r\ns challenging us, we can atleast control our own actions and habits and min=\r\nimize the bad karmas we regularly commit and the chance of a fall.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(=\r\n4) When Lord Vishnu came to earth as Lord Rama, he taught the importance of=\r\n Eka Patni Vrata (having only one wife). When he came back as Lord Krishna,=\r\n he did not emphasize that anymore and had many wives. When he came as Lord=\r\n Narasimha or Lord Rama, he killed demons. When he\n came as Lord Buddha, he=\r\n taught non-violence.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When yogis like Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Rama=\r\nna Maharshi, Sai Baba etc come also, their message is tuned for their desa-=\r\nkaala-paatra. Different times require different leelas, different missions,=\r\n different messages and different styles.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately, Jaambavanta=\r\n did not recognize when Lord Rama came back as Lord Krishna and even fought=\r\n with him!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(5) While it is illogical to hold Thakur, Mother and Swam=\r\niji accountable for the beliefs of these people, I admire their blind faith=\r\n. If it is opportunism, i.e. they just want to eat fish and use the icons o=\r\nf their organization as an excuse, that is bad. But, if it is genuine blind=\r\n faith that these icons were perfected beings and their words are never wro=\r\nng, they will eventually make it. Opportunistic and egoistic faith is usele=\r\nss, but blind and complete faith accompanied by complete surrender is very =\r\npowerful. People with such faith WILL find\n their way.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(6) The neare=\r\nst path from Ujjain to Kashi does not go through Calcutta. But, if someone =\r\ninsists on going through Calcutta, what can you do? Everyone takes a spirit=\r\nual path based on one&#39;s conditioning. If we see a short path, we can only s=\r\nuggest it to others but nor force them to take it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nNarasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish=\r\n Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tar=\r\npana:&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.=\r\norg&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ gro=\r\nup/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ grou=\r\np/JyotishWri tings&lt;BR&gt;------------\n --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Fri, 2/5/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;I&gt;&lt;=\r\nrajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-=\r\nLEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. =\r\nco.in&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Great Vimalananda&#39; s opinion o=\r\nn &#39;Meat-eaters&#39; (Aghor -at the left hand of God)&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoo=\r\ngroups. com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Friday, February 5, 2010, 9:38 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyi=\r\nv1421616119&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpac=\r\ning=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: =\r\ninherit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-stretch: inherit&quot; vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;Dear KK,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Nice question. I was also thinking=\r\n that.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Few days back when I went to Calcutta, =\r\n(where fish is the staple diet), one person told me confidently that there =\r\nis no harm in eating fish or meat because Swamiji used to do so, and in a B=\r\nengali book on the&nbsp;life of Sri Ramakrishna there is one example mentio=\r\nned where a man came to ask him if should quite non veg food, and supposedl=\r\ny Ramakrishna said first leave &quot;Kamini&quot; and &quot;Kanchana&quot;, then think of food.=\r\n &nbsp;Also a similar examples was quoted to me from&nbsp;the life of Ma Sa=\r\nrada where - a certain book says - she advised an ordinary devotee against =\r\nleaving fish eating and rather just focus mind on God.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;When I tried to reason with them that if these people were to come=\r\n back again on planet earth they may not recommend non veg eating - conside=\r\nring the state of the world today - I&nbsp; was catergorically told they ar=\r\ne all Trikalagyas, so if there is something wrong in eating fish they would=\r\n have told right then.&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Then I tried to =\r\nsay that the examples maybe specific individual cases, to which I was told,=\r\n &quot;no&quot;, because based on a whole plethora of such examples even today the mo=\r\nnks of the Ramakrishna Order in West Bengal eat and serve fish. This statem=\r\nent is a fact. I&nbsp;have had fish meals as prasad in many Ramakrishna Mis=\r\nsions across&nbsp;West Bengal.&nbsp;So, I was told, the monks of the Ramakr=\r\nishna Oder know about teachings of Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada better than us=\r\n ordrinary people. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I could make no further ar=\r\nguments and of course had a harrowing time at home trying to convince my pa=\r\nrents that I have quit non veg food. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;A lot of=\r\n Bengalis may not have been able to implement the basic teachings of Ramakr=\r\nishna in their lives, however they faithfully follow fish eating as a sanct=\r\nion given by &quot;Thakur&quot; and &quot;Sri Sri Ma&quot; and &quot;Swamiji&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;PS:=\r\n No disrespect to anyone.

Howeve=\r\nr, you are free to address me as you feel like and I&#39;ll happily accept it h=\r\nence forth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I just came across Vimalananda&#39; s thought on Karma. He s=\r\nays (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is only generated =\r\n(Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it.&lt;BR&gt;Although, it may seem=\r\n easy to understand intellectually, the state is multiple times difficult t=\r\no achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extremely important statement to answer ou=\r\nr queries.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Important information about Vimalananda which I came to k=\r\nnow only yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a sin=\r\ngle day passed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking except on the final da=\r\ny of his departure from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; fr=\r\nequently and occasionally\n ate meat. I gave this information, because as yo=\r\nu pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidence of e=\r\nxact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please also note an important th=\r\ning. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all his audience to do what =\r\nhe says and not try to do what he does.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now whatever I wrote above s=\r\neems sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Let me put in my thought=\r\ns further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the wor=\r\nth can be next to nothing). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda=\r\n or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants=\r\n, we tend to forget that they are all realized souls who achieved very high=\r\n level of spiritual realization. They are knower of everything or many thin=\r\ngs in the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned =\r\nto universal ego. In short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trika=\r\nal gnyaanis&#39;.\n Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if the=\r\ny ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually =\r\nknew what they are doing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind e=\r\nach and every action of theirs because as I said, they know complete backgr=\r\nound behind their each action and moreover their self identification is mis=\r\nsing from the action and hence it is like Nature operates through them to a=\r\nccomplish a special purpose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is v=\r\nery different from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within h=\r\nim which can consume anything and everything. A food restriction does not b=\r\nind him. He can eat anything without getting spiritually troubled but for o=\r\nthers, a kind of food intake is extremely important.&lt;BR&gt;If Vivekananda ate =\r\nmeat during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpose which i=\r\ns not\n possible for majority of us to comprehend unless explained by a pers=\r\non of that level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere seekers amo=\r\nngst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as one of them and then =\r\nslowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such other undesira=\r\nble habits. It is also possible at the same time that he is nullifying some=\r\n balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is also poss=\r\nible that he would have showered his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;s soul =\r\nby consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no apparent reasons fo=\r\nr that but just a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekan=\r\nanda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy f=\r\nrom drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in India and did not even =\r\nplanned to go to USA. When the boy, after some years actually met Swami in =\r\nUSA for the first time, swami immediately told him to stay away from water\n=\r\n and when he requested swami to accept him as his disciple, swami, after a =\r\nmoments thought told him that he is not his guru and his guru will come lat=\r\ner and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later became disciple o=\r\nf Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually given a gift of =\r\nSilver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `k=\r\nnew&#39; before 40 years.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Swami Vivekananda was all knowing and most of =\r\nus are NOT.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So moral of my whole writings is that it&#39;s unwise as wel=\r\nl as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habits of Swami Vi=\r\nvekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, T=\r\nrailang Swami and such masters and justify our completely self identified a=\r\nnd utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dve=\r\ndic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@\n=\r\n yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@... &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal Ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Gre=\r\nat coincidence of thoughts!!=C3=82&nbsp;I was about to ask this question to=\r\nday on Non-Veg eating.=C3=82&nbsp; It is clear from the below passage meat =\r\neating is not advisable for anyone.=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was=C3=82&nbsp;re=\r\nading a book on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly=\r\n wrote that he survived many days on just eating meat when he was living in=\r\n USA also relished it.

Do they ever think of the agony a hen goes through when her chicks are =\r\nslain in front of her eyes? or a cow, the embodiment of motherliness, do th=\r\ney consider how much she suffers when she sees the slaughter of her beloved=\r\n calf whom she has grown in her own body and nourished with her milk, whom =\r\nshe loves more than her own life?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do these so called humans ever th=\r\nink of the terrible pain they cause to mother cow? Could they endure their =\r\nown children being murdered before their own eyes?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; How is Ma to tea=\r\nch such donkeys? They are not humans, whose intellect is subtle enough to s=\r\nelf-identify\n with another being of a different species and experience its =\r\npersonal joys and sorrows. Ma has no alternative but to make them suffer, a=\r\nllowing the animals they have tortured to torture them in return. Fair&#39;s fa=\r\nir, after all. If I cut your throat in this birth you have every right to c=\r\nut mine in the next or some succeeding birth. Experience is the best teache=\r\nr and a fool will learn from no other.&quot;=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best Regards,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBO=\r\nDY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\nThe INTERNET now has a personality.
