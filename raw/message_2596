Dharma means the right action. The right=\r\n action changes from person to person and from situation to situation.\n \nDe=\r\npending on your vasanas from previous lives and depending on your current d=\r\nesa-kaala-paatra, Nature expects something from you. What Nature expects fr=\r\nom you, i.e. what you are capable of doing based on your vaasanas and rinas=\r\n that fits with Nature&#39;s big scheme at that time, becomes your dharma. Unfo=\r\nrtunately, it is not always easy to know one&#39;s dharma. When one has a dense=\r\n ego and strong desires, they corrupt one&#39;s vision and stop one from findin=\r\ng out one&#39;s dharma correctly. As one&#39;s ego reduces and one&#39;s desires become=\r\n less and less, one gets more in tune in with Nature and the clarity of vis=\r\nion regarding one&#39;s own dharma improves. As one fulfils one&#39;s understanding=\r\n of one&#39;s dharma impassionately without getting entangled in the web of lik=\r\nes, dislikes, expectations, excitement, disappointment etc, it offloads mor=\r\ne and more karmas and one becomes karmically lighter and lighter. As that h=\r\nappens, one&#39;s clarity regarding one&#39;s dharma improves further.\n \nLord Rama =\r\nwas born to kill Ravana and going to the forest was key to building up the =\r\nconfrontation. Also, many people he had to meet, befriend and take help fro=\r\nm in the main mission of killing Ravana (e.g. Hanuman, Sugriva, Angada etc)=\r\n were in the forest. He had several other tasks to do in the forest (e.g. r=\r\nelease the curse on Maharshi Gouthama&#39;s wife Ahalya). So he had to go to fo=\r\nrest. His guru Vasishtha imparted aatma jnaana to him before marriage and h=\r\ne realized his Self then. As a realized person, he went with the flow of Na=\r\nture and fulfilled his dharma impassionately. If you learn to kill your ego=\r\n and desires, Nature will take you where you need to go and show you what y=\r\nou need to do!\n \nAt the time of Mahabharata, the evil people to be destroye=\r\nd were not in a forest or in a distant land. They were the cousins, support=\r\ned by other relatives and gurus. Krishna was to reduce the weight on earth =\r\nwith the help of Pandavas and prepare earth for Kali yuga. Thus, Krishna im=\r\nparted Self-realization to Arjuna and made him into a warrior who discharge=\r\nd his duty without an attachment.\n \nWhat would Arjuna have gained by leavin=\r\ng the battlefield and doing Tapas somewhere in a forest? The goal of all sa=\r\ndhana is Self-realization and it came to him under Krishna&#39;s upadesa. Also,=\r\n he fulfilled his dharma without any attachment, as a realized man, and hel=\r\nped Nature.\n \n(2) Though there are formulas for dharma level in a yuga, the=\r\ny are not absolute. The dharma level changes within a yuga also. Within the=\r\n same yuga, there are phases of relatively more dharma and there are phases=\r\n of relatively less dharma. When an avatara comes and goes, the dharma leve=\r\nl is restored above the current level, to create a buffer against further e=\r\nrosion of dharma.\n \n(3) India is the land of rishis, a land of highly conce=\r\nntrated spiritual energy. However, many many millions of years back, the ge=\r\nography of the world may have been different and the whole world may have b=\r\neen one nation. Some Puranic stories are quite likely set in such a world. =\r\nEven in recent millennia, bharatavarsha extended all the way from Afghanist=\r\nan (Gandhara-&gt;Kandhar) to Malaysia (Malaya), Thailand, Cambodia (Kambhoja-&gt;=\r\nCampuchia-&gt;Cambodia) etc.\n \nSomeone like Jesus Christ may be an avatara. A =\r\nnormal person cannot say &quot;surrender to god, confess your sins and take a co=\r\nmmitment to improve. I will then take on your sins.&quot; Only an avatara of a d=\r\neity or a rishi can have such love, compassion, kindness and detachment to =\r\nthe suffering of physical body. Moreover, he established a decent level of =\r\ndharmik life in almost half of the world for a couple of millennia. These p=\r\narts of the world may have been far more adharmik if not for him. This is n=\r\no mean task. Only an incarnation of a deity or a great rishi can do somethi=\r\nng like that.\n \nOf course, if a deity or a rishi needs to be born outside I=\r\nndia to fulfil a specific mission, that can happen.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasim=\r\nha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a =\r\nShort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpana=\r\ns Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicas=\r\ntro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n  -----=\r\n Original Message ----- \n  From: Murahari Vadapalli \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com \n  Sent: Wednesday, September 23, 2009 8:54 PM\n  Subject: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] Question on Dharma of Lord Sri Ramchandra\n        Namaste, \n\n   =\r\n     There are few questions that are lingering in my mind for quite someti=\r\nme. I hope this is the right forum to discuss about avataras and dharmas re=\r\nstored by these avataras. If not, please ignore my mail and re-direct me (i=\r\nf possible) to a right forum.  \n\n        Question 1: (Lord Ramachandra&#39;s dh=\r\narma)\n\n        Lord Ramachandra has followed the orders of His father and a=\r\nccepted to go on exile to Vanavasa. \n        Bring a kshatriya, shouldn&#39;t H=\r\ne have said to father that His dharma is to rule Ayodhya than spending his =\r\ntime in aranyas? \n\n        (The great warrior Arjuna wanted to take to do T=\r\napas for he had felt that he is not doing the right thing by killing his ne=\r\nar and dear ones...but was prevailed over by Lord Krishna on Kshatriya dhar=\r\nma argument)\n\n        How is it that Lord Ramachandra has fulfilled his dha=\r\nrma by going to forests and Arjuna neglected his dharma by not killing his =\r\nrelatives?\n\n        Question 2:\n\n        Whenever dharma is being abused, L=\r\nord comes over to Bhu Loka and sets things in order. egs...Lord Rama of Tre=\r\nta Yuga, Lord Krishna of Dwapara yuga and when they leave after performing =\r\ntheir duties, dharma is set right and they have achieved their objectives. =\r\n\n\n        Does that mean that before they depart, the dharma of THAT yuga i=\r\ns restored rather than FULL dharma? e.g, Lord Krishna before departing, res=\r\ntored 2-padas of dwaparaYuga dharma and left, instead of restoring the dhar=\r\nma completely? Do avataras have to CONSIDER yuga-dharma also when restoring=\r\n dharma? Can&#39;t they restore it COMPLETELY? If so, do Kalki have to restore =\r\nthe dharma of Kali-Yuga rather than restoring it completely? \n\n        Ques=\r\ntion 3:\n\n        Why did avataras have to happen only in Bharatavarsha? \n  =\r\n      Why did they not happen anywhere else in the world? \n\n\n        Thanks=\r\n & Regards,\n        --Murahari\n       \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0176_01CA3C9D.E697A3B0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;.ygrp-photo-title {\n\tCLEAR: both; FONT-SIZE: smal=\r\nler; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 75px; HEIGHT: 15px; TEXT-ALIGN: center\n}\nDIV.=\r\nygrp-photo {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-POSITION: center 50=\r\n%; BORDER-TOP: black 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: black 1px solid; WIDTH: 62px; =\r\nBORDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-REPEAT: no-repeat; HEIGHT: 62px;=\r\n BACKGROUND-COLOR: white\n}\nDIV.photo-title A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV=\r\n.photo-title A:active {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:hover {\n=\r\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:visited {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none=\r\n\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row {\n\tCLEAR: both\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.at=\r\ntach-row DIV {\n\tFLOAT: left\n}\nP {\n\tCLEAR: both; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING=\r\n-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 3px; OVERFLOW: hidden; PADDING-TOP: 15px\n}\nDIV.=\r\nygrp-file {\n\tWIDTH: 30px; valign: middle\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row =\r\nDIV DIV A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row DIV DI=\r\nV SPAN {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: normal\n}\nDIV.ygrp-file-title {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bold\n}\n=\r\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp{\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8=\r\nd8;\n  font-family: Arial;\n  margin: 14px 0px;\n  padding: 0px 14px;\n}\n#ygrp-=\r\nmkp hr{\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd{\n  color: #628c2a;\n  f=\r\nont-size: 85%;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  line-height: 122%;\n  margin: 10px 0px=\r\n;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads{\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad{\n  padding: 0 0;=\r\n\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a{\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/STYL=\r\nE&gt;\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3603&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nbgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial=\r\n size=3D2&gt;(1) Dharma is personal.
