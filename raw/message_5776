The Hindu concentrated on the intern=\r\nal world, upon the unseen realms in the self, and developed the science of =\r\nYoga. Yoga is controlling the senses, will, and mind. The benefit of its st=\r\nudy is that we learn to control instead of being controlled. Mind seems to =\r\nbe layer on layer. Our real goal is to cross all these intervening strata o=\r\nf our being and find God.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
