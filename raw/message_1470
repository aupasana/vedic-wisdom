This is similar to death, except that there is fear and =\r\nconfusion at death and one may feel a kind of bliss when this happens durin=\r\ng meditation. However, if one&#39;s focus on mantra relaxes and one become &quot;awa=\r\nre of&quot; the experience and starts analyzing it with the rational mind, there=\r\n is a chance of one becoming worried and confused.

How can i again experience the Beloved.\nThat then is the expe=\r\nrience of mantra when it is done correctly.\nWhen the sadhak&#39;s personality i=\r\ns effaced such that the deity&#39;s personality sits there then the sadhak expe=\r\nriences himself as that Deity(Devata) .\nThere then arises no difference in =\r\nthe sadhak or the deity commanding a certain thing to happen( be it what ap=\r\npears to be good or be it that which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s perso=\r\nnality is crucial. Ugra devatas make the person care almost for nothing him=\r\nself, so self identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolut=\r\nion continues.\nRemember, there is=C2=A0very little=C2=A0according to me whi=\r\nch is black magic. It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a=\r\n higher shakti such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then=\r\n your power will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After =\r\nthe death of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he=\r\n was originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for thes=\r\ne beings. \nAttacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto th=\r\ne heads of the attackers and some people may realise this to their detrimen=\r\nt( Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his Shakt=\r\ni causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with black magic=\r\n. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack a normal pers=\r\non, and you will get a result of this from that same Atma whom you harmed m=\r\naybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack somebody who is identifying=\r\n with the universe and has very few karmas left, then the Universe itself a=\r\nttacks you, because your attack is not on the sadhaka, but on his identific=\r\nation, ie God or the universe).\nIf people persist in using the Shakti posse=\r\nsed by a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can=\r\n be used, moreover=C2=A0then their minds and intellects will not be free of=\r\n identification with the body and so their actions are those which are gene=\r\nrally termed as black magic. These people usually join the same spirits whi=\r\nch they have been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.\nI=\r\nmagine if somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then even i=\r\nn this birth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak may acheive=\r\n after a few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous effort).\nOn the =\r\nother hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may feel that t=\r\nhe 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may not acheive in thi=\r\ns lifetime.\nAccording to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so l=\r\net me suggest an easy sadhana.\nIf one is so inclined, then starting on some=\r\n good day, do 1000 reititions of the Savitri(some=C2=A0call this the=C2=A0G=\r\nayatri, but the real Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\nSame ti=\r\nme every day.\nSame place.\nSame materials.\nSame direction.\nAs little movemen=\r\nt as one can.\nCount on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\nComplete =\r\nrestraint on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the body), reduce foo=\r\nd intake, grow a beard.\nDo not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your b=\r\nowels are empty before you start.\nContinue this for 100 days and do this wh=\r\nole procedure 3 times.\nSee the difference in your personality before and af=\r\nter.\nLong and short , what is important is that life may be short, so do so=\r\nme sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically poss=\r\nible.\nI hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\nKind Love and Regards\nmanish\nYou may post this on the list as a cl=\r\narification from me if you feel that this is suitable.\n=C2=A0\nOn Sun, Mar 1=\r\n, 2009 at 10:12 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

Trying to command God is\n&gt; *BLACK MAGIC* and this =\r\nis detestable to say the least. The attitude should\n&gt; always be that of a b=\r\neggar in front of God. If anyone has said otherwise, I\n&gt; also disagee with =\r\nhim/her.\n=C2=A0\nI mentioned the above with respect to the need of thousands=\r\n of mantras and technicalities. If one does not want to command god and wan=\r\nts to be a beggar who will take whatever is given, there is no need for tho=\r\nusands of mantras and all the umpteen technicalities.=C2=A0These thousands =\r\nof mantras and umpteen technicalities are for commanding thousands of diffe=\r\nrent results from god. That is why I talked of commanding vs begging. Howev=\r\ner, this commanding works slightly differently than one may imagine. I will=\r\n elaborate.\n=C2=A0\nAlso, commanding god is NOT black magic. Commanding low =\r\nlevel beings is black magic, which can be accomplished even by a person not=\r\n quite elevated spiritually and suffering from a heavy ego. However, comman=\r\nding higher beings such as gods is possible only for a spiritually=C2=A0ele=\r\nvated person with no or extremely small ego. This commanding that I am refe=\r\nrring to is not an egoistic achievement. In fact, an egoist cannot achieve =\r\nit. Only a person succeeding in completely effacing individual ego can achi=\r\neve this commanding! I will repeat something from the previous mail to clar=\r\nify:\n=C2=A0\n\nThe universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness) , many b=\r\neings and many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible bet=\r\nween them. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is ab=\r\nle to perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoug=\r\nhts but the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experien=\r\nces the mantra. This perfect absorption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantr=\r\na then causes internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific=\r\n ways (specific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external chang=\r\nes in the universe and corresponding karmic interactions between various ob=\r\njects.\n=C2=A0\nEach set of &quot;karmic interactions between various objects&quot; is =\r\na &quot;result&quot;. Various mantras are for various &quot;results&quot;. One may term merging=\r\n self-awareness in a mantra fully and getting a specific result from it as =\r\n&quot;commanding a result&quot; from god. Whether you like the term or not, it is ess=\r\nentially that.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nBut the bottomline is this: O=\r\nnly a highly purified sadhaka of very low ego can command specific results =\r\nfrom god (not for selfishness or even ego satisfaction, but acting as an un=\r\nattached=C2=A0instrument of Nature fulfilling one&#39;s dharma set by Nature). =\r\nVarious mantras and technicalities of mantra shastra taught by rishis are m=\r\neant for such sadhakas.\n=C2=A0\nThose are hardly of use to so many people ou=\r\nt there with dense egos seeking specific selfish results. They cannot comma=\r\nnd specific results from god (because of their heavy attachment to the resu=\r\nlt, which is in turn due to their own attachment to a limited ego), even if=\r\n they use all the techniques of mantra shastra and all the associated rules=\r\n of astrology. Instead of wasting their time with these technicalities, the=\r\ny will be better off learning to be good beggars at God&#39;s door.\n=C2=A0\nJust=\r\n pick any prasiddha mantra or a mantra you feel attracted to, without worry=\r\ning about so many technicalities, and learn to be humble and surrender to t=\r\nhe Lord. Patiently wait for him to give you what you want. Like a beggar, t=\r\nake whatever and whenever he gives.\n=C2=A0\nKeep praying every day or every =\r\nsecond when you are able to. Even when you are not praying, remember him in=\r\n all of your actions. When you enjoy something in the material world, tell =\r\nyourself that it is his and that=C2=A0he gave it to you. If you remember hi=\r\nm all the time, slowly the dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. Thi=\r\ns fixing of attitude is faaaaaaaaaaaar more important than picking the righ=\r\nt mantra, right weekday, right tithi etc (that too based on unreliable know=\r\nledge coming from questionable sources!).\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThe=\r\nre may be a mountain with thousands of paths (mantra)=C2=A0for climbing it.=\r\n Each path may lead to a different spot (different experience) on the top a=\r\nnd show a different scenery (result).

B=\r\nut such advice is useless to a handicapped person without legs (a selfish p=\r\nerson with dense ego). It is relevant only to person with legs and one who =\r\nis strong and sturdy, who can successfully climb the mountain (a reasonably=\r\n detached person with very little ego).\n=C2=A0\nEven when you encounter a pe=\r\nrson who has legs and can actually climb the mountain, the stress should be=\r\n on how to climb the mountain and traverse the long path, rather than which=\r\n path to take. The astrologers who are bogged down by all the technicalitie=\r\ns and people who take customized mantra advice from astrologers and think t=\r\nhat they will get a result quickly by doing that &#39;powerful&#39; mantra are miss=\r\ning the basic point. The power of a powerful mantra is with respect to the =\r\nexperience and result obtained *after* one succeeds with the mantra.

You keep saying Parasara says so and yet t=\r\nhere is nothing forthcoming.\n&gt; \n&gt; The rashi is associated with the Aditya a=\r\ns the rashi come into existence because of the Sun, which is the agni tattv=\r\na. Vara is also agni tattva among the panchanga of Jyotisha. That is why Va=\r\nara is related to rashi. Karma has been advised in the vaara of the lords o=\r\nf the rashi or the hora of the lords of the rashi related to a bhaava and f=\r\nor this reason, fasting and other such karma related to rashi are also base=\r\nd on this. [See Prashna Marga for details].\n&gt; \n&gt; Moon is the significator o=\r\nf the Aroodha. It is the *emotional content* related to the maya manifestat=\r\nion of everything in life. Suffering is caused as we do not fathom the karm=\r\na associated that resulted in suffering and fasting is a a means of self pu=\r\nnishment and correction related to the raashi where the aroodha is. Just as=\r\n Agni has the purity to burn the root of sin, fasting on vaara related to t=\r\nhe UL is surely going to cleanse the sins associated with the suffering in =\r\nit. While this may not give a 100% satisfaction as the *moon* content has n=\r\not been addressed, at least the initiation of the aroodha occurs and people=\r\n find their partners, get married and get along with life. Proof lies in th=\r\ne pudding and with so many cases where people have fasted on UL days and ha=\r\nve got result, we have found faith in these teachings reinforced. Why fast?=\r\n Fasting on vaara is a means to correcting the flaw associated with the raa=\r\nshi. Raashi is a quantity and hence it\n is related to the material effects =\r\nof the bhava and that is what people are looking for when they come to th a=\r\nstrologer. You have done well to recall my teachings in this =C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC=E2=80=9C remember what I taught =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C Men should wor=\r\nship a female deity and women shold worship a male deity for the UL fasting=\r\n. I wonder if they really follow this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why not give fasting at night i=\r\nnstead of day? Sun is always good for the Upapada (Jaimini etc) and that is=\r\n why we have limited this to day fasting and not night fasting as well or 2=\r\n4 hour fast. This is my interpolation. [ satisfied J ] Elders would have gi=\r\nven long periods of fast starting from the vaara, like keeping 21 days fast=\r\n for the birth of child! You think I should be doing that! You think anyone=\r\n will lsiten. Try it yourself before asking me to advise those hard penance=\r\n kind of fasts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Who says the Moon has nothing to do with the arudha. I=\r\nt is the sustainer. Now people to an astrologer when they are looking for g=\r\netting married and hardly anyone comes these days asking for prolonging mar=\r\nriage. Either they want to get into one or get out of one and into another.=\r\n..astrologe rs these days are relegated to helping people make these transi=\r\ntions painless and fast. Of course some have come and I have not failed the=\r\nm.

I a=\r\nm not dismissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself and I am in fact=\r\n slowly preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do them by themselves=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] what about the Puranas? Have you gone through the Nav=\r\nagraha mantras given in the Garuda Purana and other puranic literature?\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Parasara did *not* specify the weekday or tithi for most of these homas (=\r\ne.g. planetary homas). Only for homas for specific birth doshas (e.g. Amava=\r\nsya dosha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tithi or nakshatra based on the dos=\r\nha and the deity. But the days are not based on any house or arudha in the =\r\nchart.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] If Amavasya dosha is to be performed on Amavasya=\r\n, when should the worship of a graha be done? Let us say someone wishes to =\r\nworship Mars (Mangala graha). When do you think this worship should be done=\r\n?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, the principles I am questioning are *not* from Parasara.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n[Sanjay Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna dvaipaayana) got his =\r\nknowledge and those who wrote it as scribes for him, where did they get it =\r\nfrom?\n&gt; \n&gt; Second, I said what I said in a *context*. People are mentioning=\r\n complicated principles that are not found in classics or works of rishis a=\r\nnd scaring people that performing austerities such as fasting on certain da=\r\nys cause &quot;danger to spouse&quot; or &quot;serious doshas&quot; or &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, base=\r\nd on horoscope. I find these principles illogical and based on hasty thinki=\r\nng. There may be a little difference between doing an austerity on differen=\r\nt days, but my point is that it is smaller compared to the difference betwe=\r\nen doing and not doing at all and that doing it on a &quot;wrong day&quot; does not c=\r\nause danger as being suggested.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I am sorry. I missed th=\r\ne context and just saw some mails that were forwarded to me amidst my writi=\r\nng. But them its always a pleasure to talk to you as in that many many have=\r\n benefitted, and that includes us as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Third, our shastras primari=\r\nly talk about worshipping various deities on various days, based on the ene=\r\nrgy of the *deity*. For worshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekd=\r\nay or nakshatra is better than others. This is based on the deity and irres=\r\npective of the person worshipping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man co=\r\nmes out with more money to give to beggars on a specific day, a beggar is b=\r\netter off going and begging on that day. Schedule and mood of the giver is =\r\nmore important.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] That=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s not right=\r\n...at least people who read this will think. Let=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s s=\r\nay Shiva worship on Mondays. Shiva is the pratyadhi devata of the Sun and i=\r\ns not worshipped on Sundays but on Mondays. NOTE =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C a=\r\n day after Sunday! Similarly Narayana is the pratyadhi devata of Mercury an=\r\nd is worshipped on Thursdays instead of Wednesdays. NOTE =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=\r\n=80=9C again a day after! So what happened to the energy equation? J\n&gt; \n&gt; C=\r\nhoosing the day of a remedy based on the deity is more important and the va=\r\nriations based on individual horoscope are less important. I am not saying =\r\nthere are no horoscopic variations. But they are smaller and, more importan=\r\ntly, I question if they are actually well-understood by astrologers today t=\r\no apply *reliably*. I question over-emphasizing and over-selling unreliable=\r\n principles of questionable origin and scaring people on that basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; [=\r\nSanjay Rath:] To this I can agree as many have not understood even the basi=\r\ncs of Sanatana dharma!

When one is able to perfectly control the mind a=\r\nnd *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating i=\r\nn the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect absor=\r\nption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes by =\r\nthe flow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and=\r\n that causes corresponding external changes in the universe and correspondi=\r\nng karmic interactions between various objects.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, this variet=\r\ny of mantras, experiences and results is irrelevant to one who does not hav=\r\ne such perfect control over the mind to absorb the mind fully in a mantra. =\r\nIt is relevant only to a seer whose self-awareness is quite evolved and hen=\r\nce control over mind impeccable.

In this age and time, best bet for most people=\r\n is to learn to be a good beggar at god&#39;s door.\n=C2=A0\nWhat people today ne=\r\ned for material and spiritual progress through remedial measures is a bette=\r\nr attitude in begging god rather than a better choice of tools such as mant=\r\nras and other specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to command a specific re=\r\nsult from god.\n=C2=A0\nIt is worth noting that so many great spiritual teach=\r\ners who came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking the right=\r\n mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the correct=\r\n attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, discipl=\r\nine, humility etc.=C2=A0*That* is a lot more important and useful than tryi=\r\nng to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nOne more thing. We have many mantras given by r=\r\nishis, but=C2=A0the guidelines from rishis like Parasara on how to pick a m=\r\nantra based on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers today do not ope=\r\nrate solely based on them. They use all kinds of other rules coming from va=\r\nrious traditions. They are not free from corruption and imperfection. Most =\r\nscriptures associate various mantras with various results, irrespective of =\r\nhoroscope. For example, irrespective of who is the 6th lord and 8th lord an=\r\nd lord of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for debt contro=\r\nl. And so on. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today&#39;s astrologers, wa=\r\ny beyond the scope of Parasara&#39;s guidelines.\n=C2=A0\nIf one has a sadguru, I=\r\n recommend following the word of sadguru rather than that of an astrology t=\r\nheoretician.\n=C2=A0\nIf not, there is no foolproof way to know the right pat=\r\nh. Pick any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel attracted to)=\r\n instead of wasting time and then keep working on your attitude. The latter=\r\n is the key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at god&#39;s door. =\r\nChoice of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you succeed in be=\r\ning a really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of success than great=\r\n scholars.\n=C2=A0\n\nAny prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, panchakshari, dw=\r\nadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare krishna maha mant=\r\nra, chandipath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra=C2=A0etc) can=\r\n help one make progress if one develops the right attitude. Without the rig=\r\nht attitude, even an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothing.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nI hope this sufficiently clarifies my stand.

Which is perfectly in line with everything I have learnt.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nTwo statements you have made contradict standard texts on Jyotish and M=\r\nantra Shastra. Please correct me if I am not understanding you well out her=\r\ne -\n=C2=A0\n1.=C2=A0Statement 1: *fasting on any day or any tithi* is good s=\r\no long as the sankalpa has been made for the devata you intend to pray to. =\r\nResults maybe a bit delayed but will be there.\n2.=C2=A0Statement 2: *reciti=\r\nng any prayer* will give the desired effects for any ailment we wish to rem=\r\nedy\n=C2=A0\nIs this what you intended to say or did I get this wrong?\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nStatement 1 is an arrogance that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus and =\r\nhas no relevance as the remedial measures prescribed by Parasara and others=\r\n to be done on specific days are irrlevant and not of much consequence. Thi=\r\ns sounds like another astrologer I had known some time back whose statement=\r\ns like this coerced me to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so that people =\r\nare not misled but such pretexts to knowledge.\n=C2=A0\nStatement 2 is an arr=\r\nogance that the entire mantra shastra is useless and the Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC=E2=84=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mantras for the same deva=\r\nta, like say thousands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman when any one mantra=\r\n would suffice.

I think I may have to write a book on Mantra Shastra =\r\nto validate the teachings of the vedic seers.\n=C2=A0\nI think there is somet=\r\nhing wrong in the way you are saying what you want to say.

The basic point is that Upapada is a rashi and carri=\r\nes energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the day ruled by tithi of t=\r\nhe 2nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala energy to vara, and gandanta =\r\nmay\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come into a danger. So, what is the way ou=\r\nt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why does a rashi carry the energy of vaara only and not that of the=\r\n tithi???? Why does rashi represent vaara or fire?\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Beca=\r\nuse Raashi were created by Surya and for doing so Surya took 12 forms calle=\r\nd the Dvadasa Aditya...Narasimha you ask this?? What is happening?\n&gt; \n&gt; Aft=\r\ner all, Rudra rules over the element of fire and Gouri rules over the eleme=\r\nnt of water and one worships Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus=\r\n (water) is the karaka for marriage. So one could even say that UL/marriage=\r\n is represented by water element and fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the =\r\nelement of water (prosperity and well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One co=\r\nuld even say that fasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as=\r\n it brings the fire element represented by weekday to the water of UL and c=\r\nauses &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the Maya and is associated with=\r\n the Raashi Narasimha. It is the 12L which is the creator of the UL...just =\r\nas the mother Gouri creates everything through the shakti of the graha, all=\r\n the arudha are created by her due to the lordships of the planets. So fast=\r\ning on the tithi lorded by the 12th lord will be a *more correct* answer.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\n[Narasimha] We always say that houses (t=\r\nruth) are represented by Sun (aatman) and arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind=\r\n).\n=C2=A0\nThus, 12th house is the actual creator and UL is the apparent cre=\r\nator in the field of maya. Houses (truth) should actually be associated wit=\r\nh Sun (aatman) and Shiva (and not Gouri), while arudha padas (perception) s=\r\nhould actually be associated with Moon (mind) and Gouri. After all, that is=\r\n what we do in the tripod method in dasa judgment.\n=C2=A0\nThus, it is actua=\r\nlly more logical to say that 12th house and 12th lord imbibe the agni tattv=\r\na of Sun and UL and UL lord imbibe the jala tattva of Moon.\n=C2=A0\nIs the a=\r\nbove &quot;*more correct* answer&quot; based on your own thinking or is it from a cla=\r\nssic or from tradition?\n=C2=A0\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n&gt; The mantr=\r\na one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fasting is far more effective th=\r\nan at other times. The conservation of energy otherwise spent on digestion =\r\nor speech will enable far more effective mantra meditation. So fast or keep=\r\n mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to maximize the effect of the mantr=\r\na.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with this. Correct eating is the best=\r\n blessing for good mantra practise. On days when one fasts the mind is trou=\r\nbled by hunger causing the stomach to burn and churn and this disturbs mant=\r\nra japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is many many times better than compl=\r\nete fasting.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\n[Narasimha] Well, if one =\r\ncannot fast, then one is destined to expend some energy on digestion after =\r\nall and not focus all energy on the mantra. But the bottomline is that shas=\r\ntras say that one should meditate either without or with very little food (=\r\nniraahaaro mitaahaaro). In any case, I hope we agree that meditation sessio=\r\nns after heavy eating are heavily restrained in effectiveness.\n=C2=A0\n\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;=\r\n&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0&gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching o=\r\nf gandanta concepts is quite illogical.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] It is not stret=\r\nching ... it is the very definition of gandanta =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C th=\r\ne interface between fire and water. Put a burning match in a glass of water=\r\n, the fire dies...There are other Ganda=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s in the cha=\r\nrt but they are not anta (ends). Take Chitra ganda between Kanya and Tula.\n=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\n[Narasimha] Putting a burning match in=\r\n a glass of water does=C2=A0indeed kill fire. But the question is of contac=\r\nt. If I am thinking of fire in my mind while standing in water, it does not=\r\n kill the fire. There is no contact.\n=C2=A0\nMy point is that the examples g=\r\niven have no real identifiable contact between water and fire.\n=C2=A0\nOne c=\r\nan be creative and come up with a lot of theories. For example, one can say=\r\n that Moon and Venus are jala tattva and all rasis show agni tattva (then w=\r\nhy are some rasis marked as agni rasis and some as water rasis etc) and hen=\r\nce the sign occupied by Moon and Venus cause contact between water and fire=\r\n. Then one can say fasting on the weekdays of the dispositors of Moon and V=\r\nenus causes gandanta and serious danger.\n=C2=A0\nIt is not enough to show so=\r\nme fire and some water. See what counts as contact. Otherwise, one will eng=\r\nage in illogical extrapolations.\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt;=\r\n Three years back you said you are leaving jyotish....then again you told m=\r\ne two years back and again recently that you are leaving jyotish. Now it is=\r\n getting very evident that *jyotish is leaving you*. The knowledge of Jyoti=\r\nsh is PERFECT =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C individuals embody it in different l=\r\nevels of their understanding and intelligence. \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\n\n[Narasimha] Nothing is permanent. What is one&#39;s cannot be taken =\r\naway. And one cannot cling on to what is not one&#39;s. Some rejoice when it se=\r\nems like something comes and cry when it seems like something leaves. Some =\r\nimpassionately observe as things seem to come and go and do what they see a=\r\ns their dharma with the things they seem to have.\n\nJust a factual correctio=\r\nn though: I never said I was leaving Jyotish. For a few years after my spir=\r\nitual master entered my life, my interest in other things went down (though=\r\n I continued to do other things) and my focus on spiritual sadhana intensif=\r\nied. So I said that my interest in Jyotish was very low. However, my guru g=\r\nave me a task later. He wanted me to study the teachings of Parasara indepe=\r\nndently,=C2=A0meditate=C2=A0on them and share my interpretations with the w=\r\norld.=C2=A0He said I was very passionate in my Jyotish activities earlier, =\r\nand he wanted me to do the same now but dispassionately and without an atta=\r\nchment. He felt that I still have a contribution to make to Jyotish and wan=\r\nts me=C2=A0to do it as an unattached karma.=C2=A0His word is everything for=\r\n me.\n=C2=A0\nWhat I told you recently is not that I was leaving Jyotish but =\r\nwhat I said above.\n=C2=A0\nHowever,=C2=A0if your judgment is correct and=C2=\r\n=A0if Jyotish is indeed &quot;leaving&quot; me, I am sure my spiritual guru will real=\r\nize it sooner or later and change his command to me.\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin qu=\r\note &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt; I can categorically declare one thing with utmost conf=\r\nidence. You pick any weekday or tithi and take a vow to fast or do mouna vr=\r\nata (remain silent) on that weekday or tithi and meditate with a particular=\r\n mantra (any) at the end of the day. You can take a vow to keep that practi=\r\nce for a certain duration of time (say, a few months or years) for a specif=\r\nic purpose. Take a vow and keep the vrata for the duration. If brahmacharya=\r\n can be kept for the duration of the vrata, there is nothing like it!\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n[Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine=C2=A0 statement but then you seem to be sayin=\r\ng that the Puranas and other teachings of the seers is of not much relevanc=\r\ne. Of course you are right as it will be spiritually beneficial. For exampl=\r\ne, a person wishing to marry should not fast on UL days and should choose a=\r\nny day (all days are the same) or any tithi (all tithi are the same) and st=\r\nart fasting and do a mantra (any mantra!!) and then in a few days, or (mayb=\r\ne) a few months (or maybe) a few years ... or maybe (what you did not say),=\r\n a few lifetimes, the marriage will happen! I cannot say you are wrong, so =\r\nI agree that what you say is right.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\n[N=\r\narasimha] This is a gross exaggeration.\n=C2=A0\nIs all that is being taught =\r\nand practiced now strictly from &quot;Puranas and other teachings of the seers&quot;?=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nI did not say all days and tithis are the same. Of course, there is=\r\n some difference. But, it is not as big as being made here.\n=C2=A0\nTo make =\r\nkhoa, whether one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or milk of a brown cow or a=\r\n black cow or a Jersey cow or another cow does make some difference. But it=\r\n is secondary. To say that &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas&quot; (see the quoted ma=\r\nils for such claims)=C2=A0can be caused by a wrong choice is wrong. To say =\r\nthat a wrong choice means khoa will take 100 years to make is also a gross=\r\n=C2=A0exaggeration.\n=C2=A0\nThe main thing is that you need milk and sugar. =\r\nIf one is confused by endless claims of khoa making consultants and ends up=\r\n not making khoa at all, that will be sad. In such a case, one can simply p=\r\nick some milk or the other, take sugar and start cooking khoa. It will take=\r\n an extra half hour, but the job will be done.\n=C2=A0\nI request Jyotishis t=\r\no behave responsibly and humbly and not engage in scare-mongering and say t=\r\nhat a speicifc austerity (fasting on a specific weekday or=C2=A0tithi in a =\r\nchart) can cause &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas&quot;. No wonder some spiritual te=\r\nachers look down upon Jyotish and dismiss it. Such unbalanced attitude and =\r\nself-importance from us does not help our cause!\n=C2=A0\nYes, Jyotish is hel=\r\npful, but let us not oversell it or overplay the importance.. .\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=\r\n&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt; Gem stones may harm when used incorrectly. =\r\nBut, austerities like prayers, fasting, mouna vrata and brahmacharya will N=\r\nEVER do you any harm. If your body can take fasting, you can do it on any w=\r\neekday or tithi without too many calculations.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Brahmach=\r\narya is good for someone planning to have a baby or one who cannot conceive=\r\n and this is kept for some period before the appointed date of nisheka. Bra=\r\nhmacharya is good for marriage?! I think you are mistaking abstinence from =\r\nphysical union as Brahmacharya. Oh no its so different.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=\r\n=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\n[Narasimha] Of course, brahmacharya is much more, but a=\r\nlso very difficult for most. Even physical celibacy is a good enough auster=\r\nity.

It is funny that I should be typing this email on an Ekadashi day, whe=\r\nn many Vaishnavas fast irrespective of their horoscopes.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:=\r\n] I write on dvadasi when so many vasihnava also fast and keep great auster=\r\nities. J Any difference?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here is my point and view about the ques=\r\ntion raised. 2nd bhava is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the bhava of Vishnu, sustainer, and if we =\r\nfast on the day of UL in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd house, we bring insult to Vishnu who pr=\r\novides the food for us.\n&gt; \n&gt; My dear Zoran, please allow me to express my d=\r\nisagreement.\n&gt; \n&gt; Austerities can never be seen as an insult to Vishnu. Sel=\r\nf-deprivation of 2nd house matters such as food (fasting) or speech (mouna =\r\nvrata - vow of silence) are austerities. Giving up food or speech is not an=\r\n insult to Vishnu just as giving up sex (i.e. brahmacharya) is not an insul=\r\nt to Sukracharya (Venus).\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I though Brahma was very angr=\r\ny that his sons decided not to have progeny and stayed celibate. So He crea=\r\nted others. Why was Brahma angry when his sons remained celibate? Why shoul=\r\nd Sukracharya be angry if someone is celibate? How is it an insult or not a=\r\nn insult to Sukracharya? You are taking planet signification of Venus for 7=\r\nH ...and linking this to creation process...which is wrong Narasimha. Brahm=\r\na is seen from lords of dusthana 6, 8 and 12 from lagna or 7th which is....=\r\nyou know this.There is nothing wrong with the 7th house as it is necessary =\r\nfor procreation. It is only the link of this with the Brahma graha that cau=\r\nses it to become a serious shad-ripu. Married people are as eligible for mo=\r\nksha as unmarried ones and bachelors. It depends on the following of dharma=\r\n and ashrama.\n&gt; \n&gt; Various gods bestow various things on us, some at the gr=\r\noss physical level and some at the subtle spiritual level. As we overcome o=\r\nur dependendency on gross things, we make progress at the subtle level.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; If one eats food, a good amount of internal fire (and subtle internal ene=\r\nrgy associated with it) is used for digesting it and for generating physica=\r\nl energy from it. If one fasts, that subtle energy is unused and available =\r\nfor other things. This is a tremendous benefit. As a result, one can better=\r\n digest mantras and spiritual food available all around one.\n&gt; \n&gt; The mantr=\r\na one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fasting is far more effective th=\r\nan at other times. The conservation of energy otherwise spent on digestion =\r\nor speech will enable far more effective mantra meditation. So fast or keep=\r\n mouna and then meditate with a mantra, to maximize the effect of the mantr=\r\na.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with this.

Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is many many times better than compl=\r\nete fasting.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; However, to be honest, I have not heard this about 2=\r\nnd lord and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tithi. The basic point is that Upapada is a rashi and ca=\r\nrries energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the day ruled by tithi o=\r\nf the 2nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala energy to vara, and gandan=\r\nta may\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come into a danger. So, what is the way=\r\n out.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why does a rashi carry the energy of vaara only and not that of =\r\nthe tithi???? Why does rashi represent vaara or fire?\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] B=\r\necause Raashi were created by Surya and for doing so Surya took 12 forms ca=\r\nlled the Dvadasa Aditya...Narasimha you ask this??
