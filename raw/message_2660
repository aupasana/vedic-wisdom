Kapal=\r\nikas were followers of a particular Saiva sect (the left-hand\n&gt; order) who =\r\nalways carried human skulls, wore them as garlands around their\n&gt; necks and=\r\n even ate and drank from these macabre vessels. Lord Siva himself\n&gt; is hail=\r\ned as Kapali. The Lord of the famous temple in Mylapore in Chennai is\n&gt; wor=\r\nshipped as Kapaliswara; why is another story.\n&gt; &gt; This Kapalika had been nu=\r\nrsing a grievance against Adi Sankara whom he\n&gt; viewed as a potential threa=\r\nt to his faith and sect. He took the Acharya to a\n&gt; nearby cave, made neces=\r\nsary arrangements for the sacrifice-ritual and\n&gt; prepared himself to behead=\r\n Adi Sankara. The Acharya was all along in a\n&gt; trance.\n&gt; &gt; However, when th=\r\ne Kapalika lifted his sword and readied himself to chop\n&gt; off his head Sank=\r\nara&#39;s disciple Padmapada (also known as Sanandana)\n&gt; envisioned this murder=\r\nous scheme in his mind. He rushed to the cave in a\n&gt; trice. In an &#39;avesa&#39; (=\r\npossessed with divine powers) of Lord Narasimha he,\n&gt; verily, became the ma=\r\nn-lion Lord himself temporarily. He had attained\n&gt; Narasimha mantra siddhi =\r\nand, becoming frightfully ferocious, caught hold of\n&gt; the villainous Kapali=\r\nka and tore him to pieces.\n&gt; &gt; Sankara Vijaya, published by the Ramakrishna=\r\n Math in Chennai, describes\n&gt; how Padmapada leapt into the sky, scattering =\r\naway the clouds with a slash of\n&gt; his mane, and literally flew into the cav=\r\ne, stunning all beholders. It was a\n&gt; re-enactment of the Narasimha incarna=\r\ntion once again when the demon\n&gt; Hiranyakasipu was disembowelled by the Lor=\r\nd with his leonine claws.\n&gt; &gt; Adi Sankara, hearing the thunderous roars of =\r\na lion, awoke from his\n&gt; trance and witnessed the gory scene. Padmapada&#39;s b=\r\nody was smeared with the\n&gt; blood of the vile Kapalika while his face glowed=\r\n with divine splendour like\n&gt; a galaxy of suns. The Acharya saw before him =\r\nthe awesome Lord Narasimha\n&gt; himself and pacified him with soothing and ove=\r\nrflowing devotion.\n&gt; &gt; On another occasion, Adi Sankara&#39;s hands got burnt (=\r\nthe Amaruka episode)\n&gt; but he was cured by extolling Lord Narasimha through=\r\n the famous hyms, the\n&gt; 17-verse Lakshmi Narasimha Karavalamba Stotram (als=\r\no known as Lakshmi\n&gt; Narasimha Karunarasa Stotram&#39;). These hymns are so tit=\r\nled because each of\n&gt; these verses ends with the same refrain &#39;Lakshmi Nara=\r\nsimha, mama dehi\n&gt; karavalambam&#39; (O Lord Narasimha, please lend me your hel=\r\nping hand).\n&gt; &gt; It is believed that fervent recitation of these hymns on Lo=\r\nrd Narasimha\n&gt; (one of the two stotras Adi Sankara composed on Him) will al=\r\nways help one\n&gt; smoothly get over difficulties with the Lord&#39;s helping hand=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; Salagrama, the sacred stone found only in the Kandaki river in Nepal,=\r\n and\n&gt; worshipped by Vaishnavites in their homes, is used in the puja of Sr=\r\ni Kanchi\n&gt; Kamakoti Peetam. This is said to be specially sacred to Lord Nar=\r\nasimha and\n&gt; is believed to have been given to Adi Sankara by Lord Narasimh=\r\na himself.\n&gt; &gt; R Srinivasan &quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;

Kapalikas were followers of a particular Saiva sect (the left-han=\r\nd order) who always carried human skulls, wore them as garlands around thei=\r\nr necks and even ate and drank from these macabre vessels. Lord Siva himsel=\r\nf is hailed as Kapali. The Lord of the famous temple in Mylapore in Chennai=\r\n is worshipped as Kapaliswara; why is another story.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; This Kapalik=\r\na had been nursing a grievance against Adi Sankara whom he viewed as a pote=\r\nntial threat to his faith and sect. He took the Acharya to a nearby cave, m=\r\nade necessary arrangements for the sacrifice-ritual and prepared himself to=\r\n behead Adi Sankara. The Acharya was all along in a trance.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; Howev=\r\ner, when the Kapalika lifted his sword and readied himself to chop off his =\r\nhead Sankara&#39;s disciple Padmapada (also known as Sanandana) envisioned =\r\nthis murderous scheme in his mind. He rushed to the cave in a trice. In an =\r\n&#39;avesa&#39; (possessed with divine powers) of Lord Narasimha he, verily=\r\n, became the man-lion Lord himself temporarily. He had attained Narasimha m=\r\nantra siddhi and, becoming frightfully ferocious, caught hold of the villai=\r\nnous Kapalika and tore him to pieces.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; Sankara Vijaya, published b=\r\ny the Ramakrishna Math in Chennai, describes how Padmapada leapt into the s=\r\nky, scattering away the clouds with a slash of his mane, and literally flew=\r\n into the cave, stunning all beholders. It was a re-enactment of the Narasi=\r\nmha incarnation once again when the demon Hiranyakasipu was disembowelled b=\r\ny the Lord with his leonine claws.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; Adi Sankara, hearing the thund=\r\nerous roars of a lion, awoke from his trance and witnessed the gory scene. =\r\nPadmapada&#39;s body was smeared with the blood of the vile Kapalika while =\r\nhis face glowed with divine splendour like a galaxy of suns. The Acharya sa=\r\nw before him the awesome Lord Narasimha himself and pacified him with sooth=\r\ning and overflowing devotion.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; On another occasion, Adi Sankara&#3=\r\n9;s hands got burnt (the Amaruka episode) but he was cured by extolling Lor=\r\nd Narasimha through the famous hyms, the 17-verse Lakshmi Narasimha Karaval=\r\namba Stotram (also known as Lakshmi Narasimha Karunarasa Stotram&#39;). The=\r\nse hymns are so titled because each of these verses ends with the same refr=\r\nain &#39;Lakshmi Narasimha, mama dehi karavalambam&#39; (O Lord Narasimha, =\r\nplease lend me your helping hand).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; It is believed that fervent re=\r\ncitation of these hymns on Lord Narasimha (one of the two stotras Adi Sanka=\r\nra composed on Him) will always help one smoothly get over difficulties wit=\r\nh the Lord&#39;s helping hand.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Salagrama, the sacred stone found o=\r\nnly in the Kandaki river in Nepal, and worshipped by Vaishnavites in their =\r\nhomes, is used in the puja of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam. This is said to b=\r\ne specially sacred to Lord Narasimha and is believed to have been given to =\r\nAdi Sankara by Lord Narasimha himself.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; R Srinivasan &quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;
