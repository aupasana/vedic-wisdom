(1078)\n\nThat which appears (whatever it may be), let it appear, =\r\nthat which disappear\n(whatever it may be), let it disappear. What (loss or =\r\ngain) is it to\nSelf-knowledge? That which remains after everything has ente=\r\nred and ceased\nto exist in the oneness (kevalam) of Siva =E2=80=93 who surg=\r\nes as the Whole (purnam)\n=E2=80=93 alone is Self, one=E2=80=99s own nature.=\r\n (1053)\n\nHaving eradicated the ego, which was wandering like a ghost is del=\r\nusion, and\nhaving destroyed the duality of the sentient and the insentient,=\r\n the sould\nwhich is thus drowned and fully soaked in the light of the pure =\r\nand blissful\nSahaja Samadhi, is the Supreme Shiva. (197)\n\nWhatever is seen =\r\nby the ego who, having fallen from the true state of Self\nand having been b=\r\nuried in dark ignorance, takes the body as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, is not at\na=\r\nll real and is simply non-existent. (69)\n\nOnly the ever-existing Self, othe=\r\nr than which nothing exists and from which\nnothing is different is the sole=\r\n reality. All that is known in that Siva\n(that sole reality), who is the Su=\r\npreme which exists and shines as sat-chit,\nis only that Supreme and nothing=\r\n else. (986)\n\nThose who do not keenly attend to and know the existence-cons=\r\nciousness which\nshines ever-unsetting in the heart, fall into Maya through =\r\nthe objective\nattention caused by the ego, which rises and attacks with den=\r\nse delusion.\n(644)\n\nKnow that the one real =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 appears to b=\r\ne many =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99s because of the\nbody-outlook (i.e. because of th=\r\ne wrong outlook that each body is an =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99).\nBut through the =\r\noutlook of Self, the one eternal existence-consciousness,\nknow them all to =\r\nbe one. (843)\n\nNot forgetting consciousness (i.e, not forgetting one=E2=80=\r\n=99s own\nSelf-consciousness due to pramada or inattentiveness) is the path =\r\nof\ndevotion (bhakti), the relationship of unfading real love, because the r=\r\neal\nconsciousness of Self, which shines as the undivided (non-dual) supreme=\r\n\nbliss itself, surges as the nature of love (or bhakti). (974)\n\nSince the g=\r\nreatness of the nature of oneness is that the seer alone is the\nseen, one=\r\n=E2=80=99s own reality (Self) is the greatest thing (mahat). The silent\nrad=\r\niant first person (which shines) after the ego, the first person who is\nthe=\r\n seer, has been completely destroyed, alone is Self, the supreme\nconsciousn=\r\ness. (1058)\n\nThe pure state of having very great attachment to Self and hav=\r\ning no\nattachment to any other thing is verily one=E2=80=99s state of Silen=\r\nce. Learning to\nremain as =E2=80=98I am that Silence=E2=80=99 and ever abid=\r\ning as It is, is the true mental\nworship (manasika puja). (521)\n\nThose who =\r\nhave perfect knowledge say that the state of true knowledge\n(mey-jnana-sama=\r\ndhi), in which one remains without =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 (the ego), alone is\n=\r\nmaunatapas. In order to experience (that) silence (mauna), which is devoid\n=\r\nof the body thought (the feeling =E2=80=98I am this body=E2=80=99), clingin=\r\ng to the Self in\nthe heart is the sadhana. (1193)\n\nFor the extroverted inte=\r\nllect =E2=80=93 which suffers greatly, knowing through the\nsenses only the =\r\nobjects of form and quality before it =E2=80=93 the means to abide\nin Self =\r\nis to begin enquiring inwardly, =E2=80=9CWho am I?=E2=80=9D (185)\n\nKnow tha=\r\nt the nature of Brahma-swarupa, which is (one) without another (i.e.\nwhich =\r\nis non-dual), is the ancient glory. Though that ancient swarupa (Self\nor Br=\r\nahman) appears to be like a void (sunya) it is not a void; (it is) the\none =\r\nsingle existence-consciousness (sat-chit), which is the whole reality\nitsel=\r\nf. (1055)\n\nIt is not because of the rising of an =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 in bet=\r\nween (consciousness and the\ninsentient body) that one=E2=80=99s peace is co=\r\nmpletely destroyed? (Therefore)\nunless the wretched Vritrasura, the vain eg=\r\no =E2=80=93 =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, is killed, Kaivalyam\n(the state of oneness=\r\n) cannot be attained. (856)\n\nUnless the appearance (of this world) known ob=\r\njectively by the senses, and\nthe wicked ego, the knower of it, die as food =\r\nto Siva, who shines as the\nstate of supreme consciousness, the supreme real=\r\nity cannot be attained.\n(854)\n\nThe state of the experience of the non-dual =\r\nSilence (eka advaita mouna\nanubhuti), which is attained as the experience o=\r\nf the unlimited true\nknowledge (mey-jnana), is only the shining (of oneself=\r\n) as the empty space\ndevoid of the false imagination which is the rising if=\r\n the wicked ego-mind.\n(1184)\n\nUnless one follows the principle, =E2=80=9CTh=\r\nat which is essential to be reformed is\nonly my own mind=E2=80=9D, one=E2=\r\n=80=99s mind will become more impure by seeing the defects\nof others. (788)=\r\n\n\nFear not on seeing this empty world, which appears as a dream in the slee=\r\np\nof Self-forgetfulness. This imaginary and bondage-causing world-picture,\n=\r\n(projected on the background) of the dark, dense mind, will not stand in th=\r\ne\nlight of Supreme Knowledge, Sat-Chit-Ananda. (27)\n\nGod and Guru are in tr=\r\nuth not different. Just as the prey which has fallen\ninto the jaws of a tig=\r\ner has no escape, so those who have come within the\nambit of the Guru=E2=80=\r\n=99s gracious gaze will be saved by the Guru, never to be\nforsaken.\n\nThose =\r\nwho have attained their aim, Jnana, do not see this world as a\nmultitude of=\r\n differences, since the multiple differences of this world are a\nsportive p=\r\nlay of Chit-Shakti, the one Whole. (58)\n\nThe true devotees who in all ways =\r\nremain subjected (adhina) only to Self\n(God), (alone) are tadiyars (those w=\r\nho belong to the Lord). Know that only\nfor them (those true devotees), in w=\r\nhom there is unceasing love, will the\nSupreme Abode (param-dhama), which tr=\r\niumphs as transcendent, be a complete\nattainment. (1211)\n\nBy the sharp edge=\r\n of the sword of divine Silence cultivated in the heart by\nthe practice of =\r\njnana-vichara, one should dig out and cast away the root,\nthe ego, =E2=80=\r\n=98I am the body=E2=80=99. This is the means to attain the over-brimming\nha=\r\nppiness of peace. (845)\n\nThat which is worthy to have as (one=E2=80=99s) ta=\r\nrget is Self, the knowledge which\nis pure bliss. The perfect life is for on=\r\ne to exist directly as that (Self),\nabiding in the heart through the unforg=\r\nettable knowledge (=E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99). (1094)\n\nIt is only Self, the on=\r\ne pure knowledge, that, as the unreal knowledge (the\nmind), makes all diffe=\r\nrences (vikalpas) appear. (Therefore) for the one who\nknows and reaches Sel=\r\nf, which is the harmonious knowledge, all those other\nthings (the entire wo=\r\nrld-appearance) will be (found to be) of the nature of\nthe one Self. (985)\n=\r\n\nBe assured that That which ever shines (for all) is certainly the true\nExi=\r\nstence of Self, =E2=80=9CI am=E2=80=9D. When the True God is thus realised =\r\nas one=E2=80=99s own\nSelf, without doubt or misconception, the Supreme Blis=\r\ns will brim over.\n(292)\n\nThe triputis and their source, pure consciousness =\r\ncan, under no circumstance\nappear simultaneously. Like the stone and the do=\r\ng in a statue of a dog\ncarded out of stone, when one appears the other will=\r\n not appear. (46)\n\nSince Self is the eternal, non-dual Thing and since ther=\r\ne is no means to\nreach It other than Self-attention, know that Self itself =\r\nis the path, Self\nitself is the goal, and that they (the path and the goal)=\r\n are not different.\n(579)\n\nAccept the ever-shinning Self-knowledge to be th=\r\ne only reality. Reject all\nthe triads, deciding them to be an imaginary dre=\r\nam. (578)\n\nThe appearance of this world, like the illusory appearance of a =\r\ndream, is\nmerely mental and its truth can be known correctly only by the su=\r\npreme\nconsciousness that transcends maya, the maya. (55)\n\nJust as the goal=\r\n=E2=80=99s beard wanders and wags for nothing, people roam about\nmerrily bu=\r\nt in vain, performing activities for the fulfillment of their\nworldly desir=\r\nes, while despising the disciplines that lead to eternal moksha\nin the self=\r\n. Ah, what a pitiable spectacle is the condition of these worldly\npeople. (=\r\n71)\n\nFor those who see through perfect Jnana, this bodily life is unreal an=\r\nd\nmerely mental, and therefore know that there is only misery and no benefi=\r\nt\nin jiva=E2=80=99s prolonging their jiva=E2=80=99s lifetime. (235)\n\nThough=\r\n Guru Ramana, who appeared as God incarnate, expounded various\ndoctrines, d=\r\nepending on the beliefs of the devotees who resorted to his\nfeet, what we h=\r\nave heard him say in private, as his own true experience, is\nonly ajata (no=\r\nn-creation). (Sri Muruganar, 100)\n\nThat trustworthy vichara (Self-enquiry) =\r\nexists neither in book learning nor\nI learning from, others but only in one=\r\n=E2=80=99s own sense of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 (aham). (146)\n\nForgetting the l=\r\nofty purpose of coming to the sadguru and developing an\nobsession for the n=\r\non-self is a deception brought about by immaturity in\nthose who are dull-wi=\r\ntted. (152).\n\nThough the good dharmas (righteous ones) are said to be many,=\r\n just as the\ngolden ornaments are many, the sole reality of all those dharm=\r\nas is\nsacrifice of the self, just as the sole reality of all ornaments is g=\r\nold.\n(849)\n\nEverything that one has learned is total falsehood if it does n=\r\not become a\nmeans for (mind) consciousness to subside within the self. (143=\r\n)\n\nYou should know that the veiling (tirodana) that makes jives forget (the=\r\n\nevents of past lives) is an act of supreme compassion by Iswara towards\nth=\r\nem. (116)\n\nIf memories (of the past lives) are not absent, Jiva will not at=\r\ntain\nmalaparipaka (state in which purities are ready for destruction) and t=\r\nhe\nlives of jives will get shattered and ruined. (117)\n\nThe vision of the S=\r\nelf will only be encountered by those who are free of the\ndelusion of desir=\r\ne, and not by more whose corrupted minds are full of\ndesires for sense obje=\r\nct (149)\n\nPure consciousness demands that everything that has been learned =\r\nas\nknowledge has to be completely forgotten as ignorance. (147)\n\nHe who see=\r\ns an object as separate from consciousness cannot be a pandit who\nhas known=\r\n consciousness. (132)\n\nA mind that runs after pleasure through the five sen=\r\nses, while squashing her\nLord in the heart, is an unchaste woman. (73)\n\nThe=\r\n vision of the Self will only encountered by those who are free of the\ndelu=\r\nsion of desire, and not by more whose corrupted minds are full of\ndesires f=\r\nor sense object. (149)\n\nIn the recesses of the lotus-shaped Hearts of all, =\r\nbeginning with Vishnu,\nthere shines as pure intellect (Absolute Consciousne=\r\nss) the Paramatman, who\nis the same as Arunachala Ramana. When the mind mel=\r\nts with love of Him, and\nreaches the inmost recess of the Heart wherein He =\r\ndwells as the beloved, the\nsubtle eye of pure intellect opens and He reveal=\r\ns Himself as Pure\nConsciousness.\n\nPure consciousness demands that everythin=\r\ng that has been learned as\nknowledge has to be completely forgotten as igno=\r\nrance. (147)\n\nManifestation of ancient vasanas (latent tendencies) is creat=\r\nion.\nDestruction of vasanas is the end of creation. (84)\n\nKnow that Self, w=\r\nhich is to be enquired into and attained in the heart as\nthe state of happi=\r\nness through the requisite tapas (or Self-attention), is\nonly the state of =\r\nSilence (mauna), which is experienced by removing the\ndelusive and worthles=\r\ns knowledge of differences (along with its root, the\nignorance or wrong kno=\r\nwledge =E2=80=98I am this body=E2=80=99). (1183)\n\nThe boat may remain in wa=\r\nter, but if water enters the boat, it will bring\ngreat catastrophe, (Likewi=\r\nse) a man may live in the world which is\nsurrounded by the seas, but if the=\r\n world enters the man, his whole life will\nbe miserable.

(986)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Those who do not keenly attend to and know the e=\r\nxistence-consciousness which shines ever-unsetting in the heart, fall into =\r\nMaya through the objective attention caused by the ego, which rises and att=\r\nacks with dense delusion. (644)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Know that the one real =E2=80=98I=\r\n=E2=80=99 appears to be many =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99s because of the body-outlo=\r\nok (i.e. because of the wrong outlook that each body is an =E2=80=98I=E2=80=\r\n=99).

(854)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The state of the experie=\r\nnce of the non-dual Silence (eka advaita mouna anubhuti), which is attained=\r\n as the experience of the unlimited true knowledge (mey-jnana), is only the=\r\n shining (of oneself) as the empty space devoid of the false imagination wh=\r\nich is the rising if the wicked ego-mind.

(788)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nFear not on seeing this empty world, which appears as a dream in the sleep =\r\nof Self-forgetfulness. This imaginary and bondage-causing world-picture, (p=\r\nrojected on the background) of the dark, dense mind, will not stand in the =\r\nlight of Supreme Knowledge, Sat-Chit-Ananda. (27)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;God and Guru are in truth not different. Just as the prey =\r\nwhich has fallen into the jaws of a tiger has no escape, so those who have =\r\ncome within the ambit of the Guru=E2=80=99s gracious gaze will be saved by =\r\nthe Guru, never to be forsaken.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Those who have attained the=\r\nir aim, Jnana, do not see this world as a multitude of differences, since t=\r\nhe multiple differences of this world are a sportive play of Chit-Shakti, t=\r\nhe one Whole. (58)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The true devotees who in all ways remain subjecte=\r\nd (adhina) only to Self (God), (alone) are tadiyars (those who belong to th=\r\ne Lord). Know that only for them (those true devotees), in whom there is un=\r\nceasing love, will the Supreme Abode (param-dhama), which triumphs as trans=\r\ncendent, be a complete attainment. (1211)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weig=\r\nht:bold&quot;&gt;By the sharp edge of the sword of divine Silence cultivated in the=\r\n heart by the practice of jnana-vichara, one should dig out and cast away t=\r\nhe root, the ego, =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99. This is the means to att=\r\nain the over-brimming happiness of peace. (845)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;That which =\r\nis worthy to have as (one=E2=80=99s) target is Self, the knowledge which is=\r\n pure bliss. The perfect life is for one to exist directly as that (Self), =\r\nabiding in the heart through the unforgettable knowledge (=E2=80=98I am=E2=\r\n=80=99). (1094)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is only Self, the one pure knowledge, that, as =\r\nthe unreal knowledge (the mind), makes all differences (vikalpas) appear. (=\r\nTherefore) for the one who knows and reaches Self, which is the harmonious =\r\nknowledge, all those other things (the entire world-appearance) will be (fo=\r\nund to be) of the nature of the one Self. (985)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Be assured that Th=\r\nat which ever shines (for all) is certainly the true Existence of Self, =E2=\r\n=80=9CI am=E2=80=9D. When the True God is thus realised as one=E2=80=99s ow=\r\nn Self, without doubt or misconception, the Supreme Bliss will brim over. (=\r\n292)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The triputis and their source, pure consciousness can, under =\r\nno circumstance appear simultaneously. Like the stone and the dog in a stat=\r\nue of a dog carded out of stone, when one appears the other will not appear=\r\n. (46)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Since Self is the eternal, non-dual Thing and since there i=\r\ns no means to reach It other than Self-attention, know that Self itself is =\r\nthe path, Self itself is the goal, and that they (the path and the goal) ar=\r\ne not different. (579)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Accept the ever-shinning Self-knowledge to =\r\nbe the only reality. Reject all the triads, deciding them to be an imaginar=\r\ny dream. (578)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The appearance of this world, like the illusory appea=\r\nrance of a dream, is merely mental and its truth can be known correctly onl=\r\ny by the supreme consciousness that transcends maya, the maya. (55)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Just as the goal=E2=80=99s beard wanders=\r\n and wags for nothing, people roam about merrily but in vain, performing ac=\r\ntivities for the fulfillment of their worldly desires, while despising the =\r\ndisciplines that lead to eternal moksha in the self. Ah, what a pitiable sp=\r\nectacle is the condition of these worldly people. (71)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;For =\r\nthose who see through perfect Jnana, this bodily life is unreal and merely =\r\nmental, and therefore know that there is only misery and no benefit in jiva=\r\n=E2=80=99s prolonging their jiva=E2=80=99s lifetime. (235)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though Gu=\r\nru Ramana, who appeared as God incarnate, expounded various doctrines, depe=\r\nnding on the beliefs of the devotees who resorted to his feet, what we have=\r\n heard him say in private, as his own true experience, is only ajata (non-c=\r\nreation). (Sri Muruganar, 100)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Th=\r\nat trustworthy vichara (Self-enquiry) exists neither in book learning nor I=\r\n learning from, others but only in one=E2=80=99s own sense of =E2=80=98I=E2=\r\n=80=99 (aham). (146)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Forgett=\r\ning the lofty purpose of coming to the sadguru and developing an obsession =\r\nfor the non-self is a deception brought about by immaturity in those who ar=\r\ne dull-witted. (152).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Though the good dharmas (righteous on=\r\nes) are said to be many, just as the golden ornaments are many, the sole re=\r\nality of all those dharmas is sacrifice of the self, just as the sole reali=\r\nty of all ornaments is gold. (849)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold=\r\n&quot;&gt;Everything that one has learned is total falsehood if it does not become =\r\na means for (mind) consciousness to subside within the self. (143)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;You should know that the veiling (tirodana) that makes jives forget (=\r\nthe events of past lives) is an act of supreme compassion by Iswara towards=\r\n them. (116)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;If memories (of the past lives) are not absent, Jiva =\r\nwill not attain malaparipaka (state in which purities are ready for destruc=\r\ntion) and the lives of jives will get shattered and ruined. (117)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The vision of the Self will only be encounte=\r\nred by those who are free of the delusion of desire, and not by more whose =\r\ncorrupted minds are full of desires for sense object (149)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nPure consciousness demands that everything that has been learned as knowled=\r\nge has to be completely forgotten as ignorance. (147)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He who sees an=\r\n object as separate from consciousness cannot be a pandit who has known con=\r\nsciousness. (132)&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;A mind that run=\r\ns after pleasure through the five senses, while squashing her Lord in the h=\r\neart, is an unchaste woman.

(149)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In the recesses of the lotus=\r\n-shaped Hearts of all, beginning with Vishnu, there shines as pure intellec=\r\nt (Absolute Consciousness) the Paramatman, who is the same as Arunachala Ra=\r\nmana.
