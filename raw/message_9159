As he himself clarified:&#39;man&#39;s destiny is a PROCESS of going=\r\n back the source and original&#39; the &#39;original state of perfection and freedo=\r\nm&#39;, a process of evolution.\nA perpetual cyclic movement has no finality. A =\r\nlinear process of evolution has the ultimate objective of a destination.\nBy=\r\n consecrating oneself to be an intelligent participant to the process (that=\r\n is what yoga is all about)is what sanatan philosophy recognises as our ult=\r\nimate achievement - our birth right, which all of us shall achieve one day =\r\nby the grace of the Lord Brahman. - Sri BImal Mohanty 9.4.13 (bimalmohanty@=\r\nahwan.org website www.ahwan.org)\n\n\n"}}
