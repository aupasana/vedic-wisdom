When I mention any such story I only narrate the same exactly as =\r\nit is, without adding=C2=A0 or subtracting anything from it. Conclusions, w=\r\nhatever they maybe, have to be drawn by every individual. Some may reject i=\r\nt, some may accept it, both of which are fine. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;&lt; This story seems to=\r\n like I used=C2=A0 to read in Chandamama. This guy Iyengar seems to be a si=\r\nddha if the=C2=A0 story so far is true.and he has the ability to shape shif=\r\nt and transportation. So what?? But he still needs his daily fix of bhang.&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;As per the Tantric scriptures, even Lord Shiva in his form of Bhairav=\r\na smokes ganja, drinks alcohol, eats with dogs and chandalas, roams around =\r\nnaked in the smashana. So is taking intoxicants a sufficient criteria to ju=\r\ndge anyone&#39;s spirituality? Not for me! \n&gt;\n&gt;, \n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;&lt;what does God mean in th=\r\nis tale? &gt;&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I will tell you how I see it. In this story, God means in=\r\nfinity. Now what is infinity? It cannot be described, it cannot be named, i=\r\nt cannot be understood using the five sense organs. Science does not unders=\r\ntand infinity, art does not understand infinity, nothing or nobody=C2=A0 un=\r\nderstands infinity. It is a summation of all that we know, all that we can=\r\n=C2=A0 imagine and all that is impossible for us to imagine. It is an incom=\r\nprehensible force that runs through everything, from the most loveable to t=\r\nhe most despicable , from the most holy to the most unholy, from the greate=\r\nst saint to the stupidest piece of rock at the bottom of the deepest ocean =\r\nin the farthest planet in the farthest solar system in the farthest univers=\r\ne. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Now question is, can an average human being &quot;know&quot; this mysterio=\r\nus and all pervading force? Knowing implies understanding. Clearly no. Then=\r\n how does one interact with such a thing? One way is to consider everything=\r\n, and I mean EVERYTHING from living to non-living, as a manifestation of th=\r\nat force and thus learn to love the same unconditionally without expecting =\r\nanything in return. No wonder such unconditional love is not easy. It needs=\r\n tremendous effort to change our own conditioning of the mind, and work on =\r\nour inherent biases and prejudices. That is what the=C2=A0 aim of sadhana i=\r\ns, in my view. To work on oneself, to make one ready to be able to uncondit=\r\nionally love everything. The greater number of entities one can love uncond=\r\nitionally, that much little bit closer one can come to interacting with the=\r\n truly infinite. And those few rare human beings who can love a whole unive=\r\nrse unconditionally, are possibly the closest to this supreme and unknowabl=\r\ne\n force. In common language, we call them Rishis. \n&gt;\n&gt;I like all forms of =\r\nDeities, for I find something beautiful in everyone of them. And I also lik=\r\ne the One behind forms, which is so perfectly transcendental that it cannot=\r\n be comprehended ever. It&#39;s like the surface area of the fine tip of a need=\r\nle, or the gap between the two breaths, or the millionth part of a single h=\r\nair, or the endless-ness of space, or the bottomless well of stillness in t=\r\nhe mind at certain points in meditation. The only thing that stops me from =\r\ngetting a better understanding the grandeur of=C2=A0 this formless entity a=\r\nre the limitations of my own mind and body, that I have acquired over milli=\r\nons of births. That is why Sadhana. To slowly gnaw away at my own mind, to =\r\nbe better able to appreciate this endless, nameless entity. G_d. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I do=\r\n not believe in Moksha. What is Moksha? No rebirth? If the Universe itself =\r\ngets born over and over and over, if Rama and Krshna come back at every cyc=\r\nle, who am I to demand that I should not get born? Infact, when a person pr=\r\noverbially finishes off his/her karmas, they merely go to another plane in =\r\nthis Universe and stay there for eons of time, since time anyway moves very=\r\n, very slowly in different realms. But then, if this force so wants, it can=\r\n send back any of the souls from any of the realms to any of the other real=\r\nms to serve a certain function. And if a soul stays in a certain higher rea=\r\nlm and in forced to take rebirth again, the seeds of the karmas - which nev=\r\ner really die off - are=C2=A0 watered again by the environment of birth and=\r\n they sprout into saplings. And this may go even beyond one cycle of creati=\r\non. Else why would Krshna and Arjuna fight the very same enemies that they =\r\nhad been fighting in the past cycle of creation? Mahabharata says\n so. I be=\r\nlieve it. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;What then is the final aim of all this, spirituality etc?=\r\n I don&#39;t know. Maybe, to teach us to broaden our perspectives and consequen=\r\ntially lessen our attachments to our otherwise mundane lives and its mundan=\r\ne problems. This is like a circular roller-coaster ride we see in local mel=\r\nas. Tighten the seat-belts, bring a smile in the heart, be detached and enj=\r\noy the show! \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Best of luck and take good care of yourself! \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;-Rega=\r\nrds \n&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah =\r\n| \n&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24] \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_______________=\r\n____________________\n&gt;\n&gt;From: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt; \n&gt;=\r\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;=C2=A0 &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;S=\r\nent: Saturday, 28 July 2012 7:30 PM \n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those =\r\nwho say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion \n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 Dear Raj=\r\narshi Bhai, \n&gt;How are you?

If people do not b=\r\nelieve in religion or God or afterlife, it is their problem. We are not all=\r\n equal. We all do not come from same stock. We are born with different cond=\r\nitions, go through different life experiences and go where our fate or dest=\r\niny takes us.

After all there was a dhoni fire there? Or some other God ?? \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Sri =\r\nVrindavan has a rolling population. They are not in confusion. Many people =\r\ncome there only for curiosity, many other come only for Darshan in the Temp=\r\nle and go back home happy. many others come with different desires. It is v=\r\nery wrong to expect from a person who is in fifth grade to have knowledge o=\r\nf 15th grade. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Many times people go to temple to pray and ask for cert=\r\nain things and if it does not happen they become very anti religion and ant=\r\ni God. So what?? It has nothing to do with me or you or anybody else. It is=\r\n their life. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I was very very very ill. Nobody was helping me. Many pe=\r\nople were giving me lot of pain.=C2=A0=C2=A0 I went=C2=A0 from Religious pl=\r\nace to religious place, temple to temple, holy man to holy man. Nothing see=\r\nm to worked. Then I took up religious practise of doing mantra japa and oth=\r\ner things which are in scriptures and Grace of Divine Mother it worked. It =\r\nis totally religious discipline according to our scriptures. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Do you d=\r\nrive a car? Did you pass you exam first time? I do not drive a car. It will=\r\n take me several exams to pass it. Many people pass their test first time a=\r\nnd drive successfully. Does it mean I should blame car or exams or examiner=\r\n or road for my failure??? .Many people take up spiritual life and if they =\r\ndo not find success quickly they blame religion and God. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I also used =\r\nto think that a real experience of God would be very powerful thing. but th=\r\nere are other aspects to it. If=C2=A0 someone is totally=C2=A0 dependent on=\r\n Divine Mother and calls on Her day and night, but yet he is not ready for =\r\ncertain energy or his body is not clean enough to receive a new light, then=\r\n Divine Mother would appear to him in very gentle way to comfort him and to=\r\n console so that he remains on the path. She will appear right in front of =\r\nhim but he only sees the Golden Aura and not what is middle of it because h=\r\ne is not yet ready. Whenever I think of that moment I am filled with deep b=\r\nliss and joy and wonderment. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;You are a special person doing everyday =\r\nintense haven to spread the light.Many other people in this group are doing=\r\n haven everyday to fill their life with light of Divine Beings. This is a c=\r\nomplete religious method which is also totally spiritual thing.Please do no=\r\nt get impressed with pseudo spiritual talk and tales of shape shifting. Is =\r\neverything alright in your everyday life because I felt a sadness in your m=\r\nail? I am sure I am very wrong in=C2=A0 this. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Few days ago Olympic fl=\r\name passed right outside my road.I did not go out to see it. I kept holding=\r\n to the Light which comes out of Divine Mothers Feet hoping it will become =\r\npermanent in my life. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Good Luck and=C2=A0 Joy for you. \n&gt;LaxmiNarayan=\r\n \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;___________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt;From: rajarshi nandy &lt;raj=\r\narshi14@...&gt; \n&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;Sent: Monday, 23 July 2012, 11:04 \n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] To those who=C2=A0 say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion=\r\n \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Dear Ajit, \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I am in complete agreement with your thoughts.=C2=\r\n=A0 A spiritual man once said, &quot;Religion has been created to shield people =\r\nfrom God&quot;.=C2=A0 \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;When I first heard this I was not convinced and thou=\r\nght it was some fake secularism. Lately I realized this is literally true. =\r\nHeavy psychological constructs are created by religions to protect an avera=\r\nge person from the real experience of God, which is so powerful and overwhe=\r\nlming that if and when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurricane in =\r\nyour average life and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;I will briefly narrate a true and interesting incident. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;An individ=\r\nual - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to=C2=A0 stay there for some=C2=A0 year=\r\ns. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying the discourse, w=\r\nhen a ragged looking man, with piercing unblinking eyes, comes over and ask=\r\ns for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang, stopped and ordered=\r\n someone to bring some sweets for the ragged looking man. Then he did a pra=\r\nnam to the man and said, &quot;Maharaj, please tell us some words of God&quot;. The m=\r\nan became angry, and retorted back, &quot;Why? Why waste time talking of God, no=\r\n one wants God anyway. If God comes, all will run away. So please continue =\r\nwith your lectures as you were doing before I came in&quot;. Everyone became unc=\r\nomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, the man took a s=\r\nweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky and then got up and started walki=\r\nng off. After he went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his follo=\r\nwers and said, &quot;He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a\n while, but =\r\nhe has probably lost his mental balance due to smoking too much=C2=A0 ganja=\r\n&quot;. Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird reason felt attracted to th=\r\nat ragged man and went out to see where the guy was going. As he approached=\r\n the ragged looking man, the man turned around and spoke to X in clear Engl=\r\nish, &quot;Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join me.&quot; X was of course ta=\r\nken aback, did not expect the man to speak in English and more over he had =\r\nno clue how the man got to know that he knew English (X was dressed in the =\r\ngarb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The man continued, &quot;My name is =\r\nMr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer by profession, but lef=\r\nt home long back and have been a wondering sadhu since then.&quot; X asked him, =\r\nwhy did you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied,=\r\n &quot;All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself is source of all confus=\r\nion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, reall=\r\ny no one. And God is the reason for all=C2=A0 the religious troubles and ot=\r\nher nonsense.&quot; X felt a little irritated, &quot;Why do you have so much bitterne=\r\nss about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu for long, then h=\r\now come you haven&#39;t met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?&quot;. M=\r\nr Iyengar replied, &quot;Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there is only one genui=\r\nne man here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, merely different deg=\r\nrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not accessible to ot=\r\nhers.&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;The root\n of all this problem is this God bus=\r\niness. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God ever. What is infinite=\r\n is beyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend. At best a man wil=\r\nl only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman with super-powers. If t=\r\nhe individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create this form by a pr=\r\nojection of his own mind, and he may even acquire supernatural abilities fr=\r\nom this form, and generally be regarded=C2=A0 by others as a man of god. Bu=\r\nt God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the problem is trying t=\r\no understand the infinite with a finite mind and then stressing that one ha=\r\ns understood correctly.&quot; While talking, the sadhu stopped at a small tea-st=\r\nall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off the chillum. Then h=\r\neld the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing the smoke =\r\nin small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You (meaning X) are a young man. Have a =\r\nclear mind in your head, don&#39;t get\n confused by all these show of spiritual=\r\nity you see in holy places. When I was your age, I did a lot of terrible mi=\r\nstakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infamous young man in the lo=\r\ncality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day having nothing better t=\r\no do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly realized what God =\r\nreally is and how to interact with this thing.&quot; As he spoke he reached a tw=\r\no storied house, and a man, woman and a=C2=A0 young girl came out of the ho=\r\nuse. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said to X, you too come =\r\ninside, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vrindavan I stay at th=\r\neir house. I will show you something interesting if you join me. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Af=\r\nter an hour inside the house, X was feeling very bored and irritated. The w=\r\noman was bringing different fruits and sweets for their food while the youn=\r\ng girl was massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s feet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying th=\r\ne hospitality. X thought this man is one more fraud, he abuses everyone els=\r\ne but has no qualms about shamelessly accepting the hospitality of a househ=\r\nolder and enjoying a good life. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, h=\r\ne saw that the man and the woman and the girl=C2=A0 stood up and with folde=\r\nd hands were bowing down towards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X=\r\n was sitting on the floor, facing the opp direction to the cot. He too turn=\r\ned round to see=C2=A0 what was going on. What he saw made his jaw drop open=\r\n in shock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, the=\r\nre sat on the cot a young man, who looked in his early twenties, whose whol=\r\ne skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow that lightened up\n t=\r\nhe whole room. He had a shaved head, four arms, holding lotus and weapons, =\r\nwith enchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a human being any more but =\r\na god sitting in place of what was even five minutes back only a frail, dir=\r\nty-looking Mr Iyengar. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;X did not know what was happening. He saw th=\r\ne young man gestured towards him to stand up and come near the cot. Like be=\r\ning hypnotized, X got up and walked upto the cot and the young man embraced=\r\n him and X lost all consciousness. When he woke up, he saw he was near a te=\r\nmple, in a remote location with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar=\r\n was nearby, held his hand and took him inside the temple precincts.=C2=A0 =\r\nThere he saw a dhuni burning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in =\r\nmeditation with ash all over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, point=\r\ned out that meditating man to him and then took X out of the temple. That i=\r\ns the man I was talking about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is=\r\n the only one in Vrindavan currently who has an idea what God really means.=\r\n After providing directions of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyenga=\r\nr hugged X again and immediately he felt he was losing awareness of place/t=\r\nime and lapsed into\n unconsciousness again. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;When X woke up, he was =\r\nin the room in that house, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, h=\r\nis old, ragged self, with a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, X went=\r\n to the temple as directed. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;-Regards \n&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 =\r\n\n&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | \n&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto ma=\r\nmAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24] \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;___________________________________\n&gt;\n&gt;Fro=\r\nm: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; \n&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom \n&gt;Sent: Monday, 23 July 2012=C2=A0 8:13 AM \n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion \n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0 Dear Prasanth, \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believe=\r\n in any religion \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;In general, many of those who don&#39;t believe in r=\r\neligion or God are being more honest than those who do. After all, most peo=\r\nple who believe in God look at him as a limited being to barter with. All o=\r\nf our biases and assumptions are most apparent when dealing with our Gods. =\r\nOften, religion has simply served to formalize these biases. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;While be=\r\ning mired in this word of duality, we think that an ounce of insincere pray=\r\ner can undo the whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in throughout the da=\r\ny. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that others look at all the s=\r\nuffering in the world and laugh at this concept of God. We &quot;God believers&quot; =\r\nare the culprit. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;We all have plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic =\r\npipeline. Instead of asking for the strength to be steadfast while we reap =\r\nboth kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and leave the &quot;punya&quot; inta=\r\nct. It is us &quot;God believers&quot; who look at our lives, ignoring all the &quot;paapa=\r\n phala&quot;. We look at one or two instances of &quot;punya phala&quot; and declare our p=\r\nrayers to be successful. However, an impartial observer sees it for what it=\r\n is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;For the mo=\r\nst part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual practices, ou=\r\nr bhakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds and minutes. When e=\r\nngaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time really flies. An=\r\nd yet, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our str=\r\nong worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for what it is, and laugh=\r\ns at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The best way to bring ab=\r\nout new waves of bhakti is not to look at the &quot;non-believers&quot; and try to co=\r\nnvert them. All we have to do is try to eliminate our lack of belief, and b=\r\ne honest with ourselves. If we can transform ourselves, the world will be s=\r\nerved. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If we see God as the limitless power that he is, he is difficu=\r\nlt to define. It is difficult to capture him within a religion. Religion sh=\r\nould see itself as a stepping-stone, and should ask each of us to _eventual=\r\nly_ place our feet on top of it to reach the higher goals. Unfortunately, m=\r\nost religions ask us to accept them without question. They ask us to place =\r\nour heads on them with reverence, and try to prevent the spiritually advanc=\r\ned from going any farther. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;sasneham, \n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;=C2=A0=C2=A0 ajit \n&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0 \n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n \r\n---1293697098-217490818-1343675058=:77728\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ve=\r\nrdana, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Ajit,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;Even if the play goes on, \ndifferent actors may=\r\n play the part.&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Interesting. This did not cros=\r\ns my mind. Variety is the spice of life!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;I\n am curi=\r\nous -- do you believe that the universe is maya (the way it it \ncommonly po=\r\nrtrayed by advaitins), or do you believe that it is &quot;real&quot; \n(the way it is =\r\ncommonly portrayed by dvaitins)? Or perhaps something \ndifferent altogether=\r\n?&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I believe that &quot;Maya&quot; means a sort of limited perception due l=\r\nack of complete information. It exists not just in the physical universe, b=\r\nut even in other non-physical states, though the degree maybe different. Is=\r\n the average waking consciousness real? Yes. Are higher/different states of=\r\n awareness real? Yes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Everything, from the physical world to non-ph=\r\nysical realms exist and is an extension of the Supreme. Maya is nothing mor=\r\ne than whatever obstructs an individual&#39;s mind from realizing that inherent=\r\n unity. From an individual (human entity) perspective, the point of maximum=\r\n stillness is the Purusha, what is called atmah/soul, and everything else, =\r\nfrom points of lesser stillness to the external objective reality is Shakti=\r\n. Extending this principle to the Universe, the purely transcendental non-c=\r\nhanging, non-negotiable reality can be called the &quot;atmah&quot; while everything =\r\nelse, semi-transcendental to the objective\n reality all around is Shakti. T=\r\nhus in short, using scriptural terms, Nirguna Brahman is the state of mind =\r\nof God, while the Universe(s)/various realm(s) is the body of God. Both are=\r\n irrevocable linked for all practical purposes.&nbsp; Maya is whatever inhi=\r\nbits an individual cell (a human being or animal or plant or anything) in t=\r\nhe body of the God - that is Universe(s) - from realizing the greater pictu=\r\nre. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Am I making sense? -:)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_1=\r\n34243527249950&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, seri=\r\nf;&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yui_3_2_0_18_1=\r\n34367064044582&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamajAna=\r\nnto mamAwyayamanuttamam\n ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/=\r\ni&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: verdana, helvetica, san=\r\ns-serif; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new=\r\n york, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; =\r\nface=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;=\r\nb&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Monday, 30 July 2012 =\r\n5:50 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] Moksha&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1631108739&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv1631108739ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;Dear Rajarshi,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif=\r\n;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&gt; Whenever a ring fal=\r\nls here,&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:verdana, helvetica, sa=\r\nns-serif;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&gt; a Hanuman=\r\na follows it and we know&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:verdan=\r\na, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;=\r\n&gt; it is time for a Rama to leave his body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Even if the play goes on, different actors=\r\n may play the part.

But the god of death \ncould not enter Rama=\r\n&#39;s city as Hanumana with his yogic prowess guarded \nthe gates of the city. =\r\nHanumana loved Rama so much that he did not want \nRama to die. To distract =\r\nHanumana and let Nature take its course, Rama \ndropped his ring through a c=\r\nrack in the floor and asked Hanumana to go \nand fetch it. The crack led Han=\r\numana to the subterranean realm where he \nfound countless number of exactly=\r\n similar looking rings. Vasuki, the \nserpent-king, and guarding of the subt=\r\nerranean realm explained, \n&quot;Whenever a ring falls here, a Hanumana follows =\r\nit and we know it is \ntime for a Rama to leave his body.

In this sto=\r\nry, God means infinity. Now what is infinity? It cannot be described, it ca=\r\nnnot be named, it cannot be understood using the five sense organs. Science=\r\n does not understand infinity, art\n does not understand infinity, nothing o=\r\nr nobody&nbsp; understands infinity. It is a summation of all that we know,=\r\n all that we can&nbsp; imagine and all that is impossible for us to imagine=\r\n. It is an incomprehensible force that runs through everything, from the mo=\r\nst loveable to the most despicable , from the most holy to the most unholy,=\r\n from the greatest saint to the stupidest piece of rock at the bottom of th=\r\ne deepest ocean in the farthest planet in the farthest solar system in the =\r\nfarthest universe. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\nfont color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;Now question is, can an ave=\r\nrage human being &quot;know&quot; this mysterious and all pervading force? Knowing im=\r\nplies understanding. Clearly no. Then how does one interact with such a thi=\r\nng? One way is to consider\n everything, and I mean EVERYTHING from living t=\r\no non-living, as a manifestation of that force and thus learn to love the s=\r\name unconditionally without expecting anything in return. No wonder such un=\r\nconditional love is not easy. It needs tremendous effort to change our own =\r\nconditioning of the mind, and work on our inherent biases and prejudices. T=\r\nhat is what the&nbsp; aim of sadhana is, in my view. To work on oneself, to=\r\n make one ready to be able to unconditionally love everything. The greater =\r\nnumber of entities one can love unconditionally, that much little bit close=\r\nr one can come to interacting with the truly infinite. And those few rare h=\r\numan beings who can love a whole universe unconditionally, are possibly the=\r\n closest to this supreme and unknowable force.

What is Moksha? No rebirth? If =\r\nthe Universe itself gets born over and over and over, if Rama and Krshna co=\r\nme back at every cycle, who am I to demand that I should not get born? Infa=\r\nct, when a person proverbially finishes off his/her karmas, they merely go =\r\nto another plane in this Universe and stay there for eons of time, since ti=\r\nme anyway moves very, very slowly in different realms. But then, if this fo=\r\nrce so wants, it can send back any of the souls from any of the realms to a=\r\nny of the other realms to serve a certain function. And if a soul stays in =\r\na certain higher realm and in forced to take rebirth again, the seeds of th=\r\ne karmas - which never really die off - are&nbsp; watered again by the envi=\r\nronment of birth and they sprout into saplings. And this may go even beyond=\r\n one cycle of creation. Else why would Krshna and Arjuna fight the very sam=\r\ne enemies that they had been fighting in the past cycle of creation? Mahabh=\r\narata says so.

Why does this so called spiritu=\r\nal man has to dump his failure on&nbsp; religion. If people do not believe =\r\nin religion or God or afterlife, it is their problem.
