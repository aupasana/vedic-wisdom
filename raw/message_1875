At the time of that prediction, there were no such indications on\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\ne ground. But he did come into politics in the same timeframe. The\n&gt; &gt; init=\r\nial talk was in 2007, he finally formed a party in 2008 and\n&gt; &gt; elections w=\r\nere in 2009. Though his party did badly, he was elected as a\n&gt; &gt; legislator=\r\n (MLA) in May 2009.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the original prediction was quite suc=\r\ncessful. However, I upped\n&gt; &gt; the ante last year by suggesting that Chiranj=\r\neevi&#39;s party would do well\n&gt; &gt; in 2009 elections. Though I was not specific=\r\n regarding his level of\n&gt; &gt; success and did not predict that he would becom=\r\ne the Chief Minister, I\n&gt; &gt; was honestly expecting his party to do better t=\r\nhan they managed. Thus,\n&gt; &gt; the followup of my original prediction is a fai=\r\nlure.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is my personal observation that the =\r\nsuccess rate in high profile\n&gt; &gt; political predictions is less than in regu=\r\nlar predictions like marriage,\n&gt; &gt; job, childbirth etc in &quot;regular&quot; charts.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In some cases, the reason is that the birthdata is not accurat=\r\ne and\n&gt; &gt; yet we are eager to make predictions. But sometimes we make bad\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; predictions with good data too. Of course, it can be a human error in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; judging various factors. However, that human error seems to be a little\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; more common in high profile political predictions than in regular\n&gt; &gt; pr=\r\nedictions. What could be the reason?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder if the factor of =\r\nfree will that is left out of astrology\n&gt; &gt; plays a bigger role in politica=\r\nl charts. I will try to think loud and\n&gt; &gt; elaborate what I mean.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One&#39;s birth chart contains the list of actions committ=\r\ned in previous\n&gt; &gt; lives using one&#39;s free will that are to give their react=\r\nions in this\n&gt; &gt; life. However, as life goes on, one accumulates newer acti=\r\nons committed\n&gt; &gt; in THIS life using one&#39;s free will. What happens at any p=\r\noint of time in\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s life is a function of ALL actions committed by on=\r\ne until that\n&gt; &gt; point of time, INCLUDING the actions committed in THIS lif=\r\ne until now.\n&gt; &gt; Some key actions committed using one&#39;s free will in THIS l=\r\nife,\n&gt; &gt; especially at important crossroads in life, should impact the life=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; events from then onwards.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many people are weighed down by =\r\ntoo many karmas and always playing a\n&gt; &gt; catchup. In other words, destiny (=\r\nsum of the actions of previous lives\n&gt; &gt; which are to give a reaction now) =\r\nis too weighty and free will in this\n&gt; &gt; life has little scope. When the op=\r\ntions available for the free will in\n&gt; &gt; this life are limited, there may n=\r\not be significant actions using free\n&gt; &gt; will and hence the modifications t=\r\no destiny based on actions of this\n&gt; &gt; life may not be big enough. Thus, ho=\r\nroscope may be sufficient to predict\n&gt; &gt; events.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, highl=\r\ny popular, successful and high profile public\n&gt; &gt; personalities may have le=\r\nss restrictions and more options available for\n&gt; &gt; their free will. With th=\r\neir free will being more free and powerful, the\n&gt; &gt; actions committed by th=\r\neir free will may have a higher weightage. As we\n&gt; &gt; are able to see only t=\r\nheir destiny in the horoscope (free will exercise\n&gt; &gt; upto birth) and unabl=\r\ne to factor in how free will was exercised in this\n&gt; &gt; life until now, we a=\r\nre perhaps handicapped in our predictions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Whether a political =\r\nleader is in limelight and becomes MP or the\n&gt; &gt; leader of opposition in pa=\r\nrliament or the Prime Minister, he is enjoying\n&gt; &gt; some political power. Pr=\r\nevious karmas placed him in a position to enjoy\n&gt; &gt; that power. To predict =\r\nthe specific degree of power and make an accurate\n&gt; &gt; prediction, is the ho=\r\nroscope sufficient always? Could the exercise of\n&gt; &gt; free will in this life=\r\n until now make a difference in some high profile\n&gt; &gt; charts?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=\r\n * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am just thinking loud here.

But he did c=\r\nome into politics in the same timeframe. The&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; initial talk was=\r\n in 2007, he finally formed a party in 2008 and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; elections wer=\r\ne in 2009. Though his party did badly, he was elected as \na&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; le=\r\ngislator (MLA) in May 2009.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \nThus, the =\r\noriginal prediction was quite successful. However, I upped&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; th=\r\ne ante last year by suggesting that Chiranjeevi&#39;s party would do \nwell&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; in 2009 elections. Though I was not specific regarding his \nlevel =\r\nof&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; success and did not predict that he would become the Chief =\r\n\nMinister, I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was honestly expecting his party to do better tha=\r\nn they \nmanaged. Thus,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the followup of my original prediction =\r\nis a \nfailure.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is my personal observation that the success rate in h=\r\nigh \nprofile&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; political predictions is less than in regular pre=\r\ndictions \nlike marriage,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; job, childbirth etc in &quot;regular&quot; char=\r\nts.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In some cases, the reason is that =\r\nthe birthdata is \nnot accurate and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; yet we are eager to make pr=\r\nedictions. But \nsometimes we make bad&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; predictions with good da=\r\nta too. Of course, it \ncan be a human error in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; judging various=\r\n factors. However, that \nhuman error seems to be a little&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; more=\r\n common in high profile \npolitical predictions than in regular&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n predictions. What could be \nthe reason?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; I wonder if the factor of free \nwill that is left out of astrology&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; plays a bigger role in political \ncharts. I will try to think loud a=\r\nnd&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; elaborate what I mean.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One&#39;s \nbirth chart contains the =\r\nlist of actions committed in previous&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nlives using one&#39;s free =\r\nwill that are to give their reactions in this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; life. However, =\r\nas life goes on, one accumulates newer actions \ncommitted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in T=\r\nHIS life using one&#39;s free will. What happens at any \npoint of time in&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; one&#39;s life is a function of ALL actions committed \nby one until tha=\r\nt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; point of time, INCLUDING the actions committed in \nTHIS life=\r\n until now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Some key actions committed using one&#39;s free \nwill =\r\nin THIS life,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; especially at important crossroads in life, \nsho=\r\nuld impact the life&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; events from then onwards.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Many people are weighed down by too many karmas and \na=\r\nlways playing a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; catchup. In other words, destiny (sum of the \n=\r\nactions of previous lives&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; which are to give a reaction now) is=\r\n too \nweighty and free will in this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; life has little scope. Whe=\r\nn the \noptions available for the free will in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; this life are li=\r\nmited, there \nmay not be significant actions using free&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; will a=\r\nnd hence the \nmodifications to destiny based on actions of this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; life may not be \nbig enough. Thus, horoscope may be sufficient to predict=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nevents.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; However, highly =\r\npopular, successful \nand high profile public&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; personalities may=\r\n have less restrictions \nand more options available for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; their =\r\nfree will. With their free \nwill being more free and powerful, the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; actions committed by their \nfree will may have a higher weightage. As =\r\nwe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; are able to see only \ntheir destiny in the horoscope (free =\r\nwill exercise&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; upto birth) and \nunable to factor in how free wi=\r\nll was exercised in this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; life until \nnow, we are perhaps handi=\r\ncapped in our predictions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whether a p=\r\nolitical leader is in limelight and becomes MP or \nthe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; leader =\r\nof opposition in parliament or the Prime Minister, he is \nenjoying&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; some political power. Previous karmas placed him in a \nposition to enj=\r\noy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that power. To predict the specific degree of \npower and ma=\r\nke an accurate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; prediction, is the horoscope sufficient \nalways=\r\n? Could the exercise of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; free will in this life until now make =\r\n\na difference in some high profile&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; charts?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I am just think=\r\ning loud \nhere.
