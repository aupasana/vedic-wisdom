Others may have the same questions.\n\n1. Sound is nothing but vibration. When vibrating vocal cards make air \nparticles vibrate, that vibration reaches the ear drums of people. \nHowever, it is not just gross matter that vibrates. With every thought, \nmind vibrates too. Vibrations in subtle matter around us are more \npowerful than vibrations in gross matter around us.\n\nThe intentions and attitude are an important factor in deciding the \nquality of vibrations at the subtle level. Subtle level is definitely \nmore important than gross level.\n\n2. Normally, we make offering with palm facing up. Palm facing up is a \nsymbol of asking and palm facing down is a symbol of commanding. When we \nmake any offering to any god in homam or to an idol or to any respected \nperson, we make it palm facing up.\n\nMaking an offering, one can hold it between (1) thumb and index finger, \n(2) thumb and ring finger, (3) thumb and middle & ring fingers.\n\nThumb symbolizes ahamkara (sense of I). Ring, middle, index and little \nfingers stand for dharma (duty/principles), artha (resources/work), \nkaama (motivation/desire) and moksha (detachment/liberation). When we \nmeditate or hold a mala or make offerings in homam, thumb (ahamkara) is \nassociated with one or more of purusharthas. The most popular mudra is \ntips of thumb and index finger touching each other. It increase \nknowledge and detachment. Another popular mudra is thumb touching ring & \nmiddle fingers. This is for dharmarhas, i.e. increase one&#39;s resources \nand follow dharma. Some people also use only ring finger, i.e. follow \ndharma. But using only middle finger is forbidden, i.e. why do you need \nresources (money etc) if not to follow dharma?!\n\nWhen using a mala or holding a ghee spoon for making offerings in homam, \nsome people keep the index finger away and use only the fingers. They \nbelieve that index finger should not be used. Well, index finger is the \nfinger of liberation and knowledge. There is no need to avoid it, unless \nyou are doing a ritual for a very specific result.\n\n3. Different materials have different properties and cause different \nresults. It is a good idea for people to rotate and offer various things \neach.\n\n4. :-) There are already people whose consciousness has ascended to \nother dimensions. There were, are and will be such people. Don&#39;t look at \n2012 as a bus that should not be missed or something like that. In fact, \n2012 has no real spiritual significance. It comes in the middle of a \nperiod of spiritual transformation on earth. I see the years AFTER 2012 \nas being important, rather than 2012 itself. Due to the mass hysteria \nthat may develop in parts of human society, aided by natural events, \n2012 may indeed bring some big changes. But the real transformation will \nbe afterwards. For example, I see 2015-2020 as a very important time.\n\nThe specifics are tough to know, but one thing is certain. An unwise and \nselfish civilization swept most of earth and was about to nearly destroy \nearth. It has been stopped. The foundation has been laid for the fall of \nthis civilization and for the old ways will return. People will be \nwiser, more selfless and will lead more dharmik and wholesome lives. \nSadhana done by all of us will smooth out the transformation and speed \nthings up.\n\nForget about technicalities like 5th dimension, ascension etc and just \ndo sadhana. The key is to not want anything specifically, yet be able to \ndo anything conscience tells us one we need to do, and being able to \naccept any end result in the end.\n\n5. I do not know much about &quot;Shiva yoga&quot;. Yoga basically means oneness. \nWe essentially want to merge individual consciousness with cosmic \nconsciousness. There are many ways to do it. All are valid paths. Some \ntake longer, some take shorter, but all are valid. Each path has \ndifferent challenges and different advantages. One&#39;s own prior \nconditioning may make one like some paths and dislike some.\n\nIrrespective of which path one selects for yoga, one huge catalyst is \nthe influence of sadguru. A sadguru who throws light on one&#39;s weaknesses \nand helps one overcome those, will aid significantly, especially in the \nbeginning. After one reaches some level, one&#39;s own conscience can act as \none&#39;s guru and guide one well. But, in the beginning, a sadguru helps.\n\nMany specific paths become popular when an elevated person popularizes \nthem and some people around him/her make brisk progress in that path. \nBut, things slow down for the next generations.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThat is why, in order to ensure a stream of seekers who make good \nprogress over the next few centuries, without depending on an external \nguru in flesh, we are popularizing homam again. Agni is an energy form \nthat you can see and touch physically. He is a living god on earth.\n\nAgni (Fire) is the original seer, original purohit, original priest and \noriginal guru. If one makes acquaintance with Agni, Agni takes care of \none. Agni works on one&#39;s attitude, transforms one from inside, sharpens \nand strengthens one&#39;s conscioence and helps one make spiritual progress.\n\nIf you have a good guru, follow whatever path he/she shows you. If not, \nsurrender to Agni. Agni will direct you to your ishta devata. Narasimha, \nManish etc will leave this earth sooner or later. But Agni will be here \nin physical form to guide you forever. Many people will make progress \nusing Fire, in the coming few centuries.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- On Sat, 7/2/11, &lt;deleted&gt; wrote:\n\n     From: &lt;deleted&gt;\n     Subject: Few Queries\n     To: pvr108@...\n     Date: Saturday, July 2, 2011, 7:21 AM\n\n     Dear Mr.PVR,\n     Hi,I really enjoyed going through you book online(vedic-wisdom),I \nhad a few queries of my own,hope to get enlightene:\n     1.Does Intention have more weight-age than Intonation/correct \npronounciation(we usually turn to god when nothing else works and not \nall of us are good at Sanskrit) while doing havan/homam ?\n     2.Should we hold the samagri in middle two fingers and offer it \npalm facing downward or upwards?\n     3.What is difference between one who is offering ghee and one is \noffering samagri in havan...when a family is doing havan together.\n     4.What are your views on Ascencion to 5th Dimension that we are \nhearing about in 2012?\n     5.And what about shiv yog...the difference if any from reiki?\n     Hoping for your reply at earliest..\n     Regards,\n     &lt;deleted&gt;\n\n"}}
