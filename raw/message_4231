You can find some answers =\r\nin the archives. I will\nbriefly answer again.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On your first point: =\r\nYes, Lord Krishna did indeed say in the 10th\nchapter of BhagavadGita: &quot;yaGY=\r\naanaam japayaGYo.asmi&quot; (of all\nsacrifices/rituals, I am the japa yajna, i.e=\r\n. chanting of mantras).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; We can get it in right perspe=\r\nctive by noting that the very previous\nline says &quot;I am Om among all mantras=\r\n&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Yes, Om represents the pure and absolute essence of universe.\nHo=\r\nwever, is it possible for everyone to meditate just using &quot;Om&quot; and\nreach go=\r\nd? Probably not. Are Krishna devotees leaving other mantras such\nas the mah=\r\namantra (Hare krishna mantra) and doing japam only with &quot;Om&quot;,\nbecause Krish=\r\nna said I am &quot;Om&quot; among mantras? Of course, not.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Same thing holds t=\r\no japam vs other sadhanas such as homam.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Just as one may need ropes=\r\n and other gear to climb mount everest,\none may need to employ mantras othe=\r\nr than &quot;Om&quot; and practices other than\n&quot;japam&quot; to overcome one&#39;s short-coming=\r\ns and reach the summit of the\nabsolute, represented by Om (and all other th=\r\nings mentioned by Krishna).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When you do an external s=\r\nacrifical ritual such as homam, your body\nis engaging in actions. So your m=\r\nind has to be attached to the body and\nuse it in a particular way. Can one =\r\nreach samadhi while doing homam?\nUnlikely. One is more likely to reach sama=\r\ndhi when one stops the\nexternal actions. Mind may be withdrawn completely f=\r\nrom the body and\nabsorb fully in the mantra at some stage then.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fro=\r\nm the point of view, japam (sitting still and meditating on a\nmantra) is th=\r\ne ultimate sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, not everyone can reach god like that. =\r\nThere are so many\nvasanas (conditioning) in the mind that needs to be purge=\r\nd/purified\nslowly. Until that is done, japam may not help one reach god. Un=\r\ntil\nthen, taking the help of an external pure object (such as fire) that ha=\r\ns\na purifying effect on one&#39;s subtle consciousness can be helpful. It\n*prep=\r\nares* one for good japam.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A lot of priests do homam a=\r\nnd then leave the fire and go away. In\nthe homam manuals, I have made it a =\r\npoint to insist that people do japam\nwith their favorite mantra at the end =\r\nof the homam, while sitting still\nwith closed eyes. The idea is that homam =\r\npurifies subtle consciousness\nand *prepares* one for reaching god, while it=\r\n is finally japam that\ntakes one to god. After every homam, one&#39;s internal =\r\npurity is at a\nmaximum (a local maximum, temporally speaking - sorry for th=\r\ne technical\njargon) and japam will be more fruitful than at other times.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now onto other questions:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (1) It is unfruitful =\r\nin the sense that it does not take you closer\nto god. It is fruitful in the=\r\n sense that it stops you from going much\nfurther away from god. After all, =\r\nif you weren&#39;t engaged in that japam\nand you were doing some other activity=\r\n, probably your mind will wander\neven more.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I suggest looking at di=\r\nsturbing thoughts in the middle of a japam as\na heckler interrupting your s=\r\npeech. Instead of arguing and fighting with\nthe heckler, simply take note o=\r\nf him, pause for a second and move on.\nInstead of panicking or worrying, si=\r\nmply take note of your thoughts,\npause for a second and move on.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (2=\r\n) Mantra means that which protects (tra) the mind (mana). Various\nvasanas (=\r\nconditioning) are pulling the mind in different directions to\nreact to vari=\r\nous situations in various ways and that activity tires out\nthe mind. You pr=\r\notect it by anchoring it in a mantra and teaching it to\novercome the pulls =\r\nof vasana.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The proof of whether a mantra or japam or homam is worki=\r\nng for you\nor not is whether there is a slow internal transformation in you=\r\n or not,\nwhether your internal reaction to various external things is chang=\r\ning\nfor the better or not.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (3) Difficult. This is where a good guru=\r\n is helpful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Actually, in this age, technical perfection is almost =\r\nruled out. I\nsuggest doing whatever one does with a sense of surrender and =\r\nhumility.\nIf there is something partly correct that somebody is doing, it w=\r\nill\nslowly increase with time and Nature will remove imperfections with\ntim=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (4) I can write Obama&#39;s name and Gordon&#39;s name on sheets of pape=\r\nr\nnext to me and pretend that they came there and sat there. Will they\nreal=\r\nly do it? On the other hand, if I am a world leader holding a\nsummit, proba=\r\nbly I can make them actually come and sit there.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nyasa means placem=\r\nent. When you do nyasa, you place various\nvibrations (sound patterns) or en=\r\nergies (deities) in various body parts.\nFor most of us with distracted mind=\r\ns, it is merely a formality and means\nnothing. Only a sadhaka with a pure, =\r\npointed and focused mind can\nactually place various vibrations and energies=\r\n in various body parts.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I always suggest to people to do nyasa as t=\r\naught by elders (so that\nthe knowledge lives and is passed on), but not wor=\r\nry too much about it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As I said, we are in the midst of deepening K=\r\nali and the level of\nsadhakas is not as high as in the old days. Technical =\r\nperfection will\nbecome rarer and rarer. It is better to focus on surrender =\r\nand humility.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free=\r\n Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for=\r\n short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Fil=\r\nms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://gro=\r\nups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ---- Veneet Kumar kveneet@yahoo. c=\r\nom&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the Bhagvata Gita, Krishna says that I am &quot;Japa&quot; amongs=\r\nt all\nYajnas. This statement establishes the supremacy of Japa over all oth=\r\ner\nkinds of rituals. I have the following queries regarding Japa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; 1) Many a times while doing japa the mind wanders. The chanting\ndone at =\r\nthese instants are done without any &quot;bhavana&quot; or sense of\ndevotion in the m=\r\nind and are merely a physical chanting. Are such japas\nunfruitful?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; 2) Is there some way to validate that the japa shall actually\nbring cer=\r\ntain merits or nullify the targeted evils?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) How can an ordina=\r\nry person determine whether the japa he is\ndoing (or has done) is being don=\r\ne in a proper manner? For example if\nthere was some error in pronunciation =\r\nor some nyasa was not performed\ncorrectly which invalidated the japa - can =\r\nit be detected by the sadhaka\nhimself by some means?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4) There i=\r\ns a tradition of doing some nyasa etc before doing\nmantras where deities ar=\r\ne invited on various body parts. Do those\ndeities actually come and protect=\r\n the entire process of Japa? Can one\nperceive their presence in anyway - sa=\r\ny maybe by observing a change in\nthe aura around the sadhaka?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nith regards\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\r\n--1-1470416869-8265409645=:9\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n\nExcellent post .Pearls of Wisdom&lt;b&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; It is said, .The aspirant=\r\n might have received the grace of the\nguru, the Lord and his devotees; but =\r\nhe comes to grief without the\ngrace of .one...

Love of =\r\nGod is the essential thing.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Have i=\r\nntense devotion to God. One must work hard. How can one achieve anything wi=\r\nthout effort? You must devote some time for prayer even in the midst of the=\r\n busiest hour of the day.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; God cann=\r\not be realized without love, yes, sincere, absolute&nbsp;love.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbs=\r\np;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; All depends on the grace of God. He bestows hi=\r\ns grace upon anyone he likes. Grace is the important thing.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; The human teacher utters the mantra into the ear;=\r\n but God breathes the spirit into the soul.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; The grace of God is the thing that is needful.One should pray for=\r\n the grace of God. One must pray sitting on the bank of the river. One will=\r\n be taken across in proper time.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; E=\r\nven the water which has got a natural tendency to flow downwards, is drawn =\r\nup to the sky by the sun.s rays. In the same way, God.s grace lifts up the =\r\nmind which has got a tendency to run after sense objects.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; One must perform work. It is only through work that=\r\n the bondage of work will be cut asunder and one will acquire a spirit of n=\r\non-attachment. One should not be without work even for a moment.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; If you do not pray to God, what is that to h=\r\nim? It is only your misfortune.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Ev=\r\nerything depends upon one.s mind. Nothing can be achieved without purity of=\r\n mind.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; It is said, .The aspirant m=\r\night have received the grace of the guru, the Lord and his devotees; but he=\r\n comes to grief without the grace of .one...

You can find some a=\r\nnswers in the archives. I will briefly answer again.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; On your first point: Yes, Lord Krishna did indeed say in the 10th chap=\r\nter of BhagavadGita: &quot;yaGYaanaam japayaGYo.asmi&quot; (of all sacrifices/rituals=\r\n, I am the japa yajna, i.e. chanting of mantras).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; We can get it in right perspective by no=\r\nting that the very previous line says &quot;I am Om among all mantras&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, Om represents the pure and absolute essence of univ=\r\nerse. However, is it possible for everyone to meditate just using &quot;Om&quot; and =\r\nreach god? Probably not. Are Krishna devotees leaving other mantras such as=\r\n the mahamantra (Hare krishna mantra) and doing japam only with &quot;Om&quot;, becau=\r\nse Krishna said I am &quot;Om&quot; among mantras? Of course, not.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Same thing holds to japam vs other sadhanas such as homam.&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Just as one may need ropes and other gear to climb moun=\r\nt everest, one may need to employ mantras other than &quot;Om&quot; and practices oth=\r\ner than &quot;japam&quot; to overcome one&#39;s short-comings and reach the summit of the=\r\n absolute, represented by Om (and all other things mentioned by Krishna).&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; When you do an e=\r\nxternal sacrifical ritual such as homam, your body is engaging in actions. =\r\nSo your mind has to be attached to the body and use it in a particular way.=\r\n Can one reach samadhi while doing homam? Unlikely. One is more likely to r=\r\neach samadhi when one stops the external actions. Mind may be withdrawn com=\r\npletely from the body and absorb fully in the mantra at some stage then.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; From the point of view, japam (sitting still and m=\r\neditating on a mantra) is the ultimate sadhana.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nHowever, not everyone can reach god like that. There are so many vasanas (c=\r\nonditioning) in the mind that needs to be purged/purified slowly. Until tha=\r\nt is done, japam may not help one reach god. Until then, taking the help of=\r\n an external pure object (such as fire) that has a purifying effect on one&#39;=\r\ns subtle consciousness can be helpful. It *prepares* one for good japam.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; A lot of priests =\r\ndo homam and then leave the fire and go away. In the homam manuals, I have =\r\nmade it a point to insist that people do japam with their favorite mantra a=\r\nt the end of the homam, while sitting still with closed eyes. The idea is t=\r\nhat homam purifies subtle consciousness and *prepares* one for reaching god=\r\n, while it is finally japam that takes one to god. After every homam, one&#39;s=\r\n internal purity is at a maximum (a local maximum, temporally speaking - so=\r\nrry for the technical jargon) and japam will be more fruitful than at other=\r\n times.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Now ont=\r\no other questions:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (1) It is unfruitful in the s=\r\nense that it does not take you closer to god. It is fruitful in the sense t=\r\nhat it stops you from going much further away from god. After all, if you w=\r\neren&#39;t engaged in that japam and you were doing some other activity, probab=\r\nly your mind will wander even more.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I suggest lo=\r\noking at disturbing thoughts in the middle of a japam as a heckler interrup=\r\nting your speech. Instead of arguing and fighting with the heckler, simply =\r\ntake note of him, pause for a second and move on. Instead of panicking or w=\r\norrying, simply take note of your thoughts, pause for a second and move on.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) Mantra means that which protects (tra) the =\r\nmind (mana). Various vasanas (conditioning) are pulling the mind in differe=\r\nnt directions to react to various situations in various ways and that activ=\r\nity tires out the mind. You protect it by anchoring it in a mantra and teac=\r\nhing it to overcome the pulls of vasana.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The pro=\r\nof of whether a mantra or japam or homam is working for you or not is wheth=\r\ner there is a slow internal transformation in you or not, whether your inte=\r\nrnal reaction to various external things is changing for the better or not.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (3) Difficult. This is where a good guru is hel=\r\npful.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Actually, in this age, technical perfectio=\r\nn is almost ruled out. I suggest doing whatever one does with a sense of su=\r\nrrender and humility. If there is something partly correct that somebody is=\r\n doing, it will slowly increase with time and Nature will remove imperfecti=\r\nons with time.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (4) I can write Obama&#39;s name and =\r\nGordon&#39;s name on sheets of paper next to me and pretend that they came ther=\r\ne and sat there. Will they really do it? On the other hand, if I am a world=\r\n leader holding a summit, probably I can make them actually come and sit th=\r\nere.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Nyasa means placement. When you do nyasa, y=\r\nou place various vibrations (sound patterns) or energies (deities) in vario=\r\nus body parts. For most of us with distracted minds, it is merely a formali=\r\nty and means nothing. Only a sadhaka with a pure, pointed and focused mind =\r\ncan actually place various vibrations and energies in various body parts.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I always suggest to people to do nyasa as taught =\r\nby elders (so that the knowledge lives and is passed on), but not worry too=\r\n much about it.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; As I said, we are in the midst o=\r\nf deepening Kali and the level of sadhakas is not as high as in the old day=\r\ns. Technical perfection will become rarer and rarer. It is better to focus =\r\non surrender and humility.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- -&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons=\r\n, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short =\r\nHomam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ---- Veneet Kumar kveneet@yahoo. com&gt; wrote: &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the Bhagvata Gita, Krishna says that I am &quot;Japa&quot; amongst =\r\nall Yajnas. This statement establishes the supremacy of Japa over all other=\r\n kinds of rituals. I have the following queries regarding Japa.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Many a times while doing japa the mind wanders=\r\n. The chanting done at these instants are done without any &quot;bhavana&quot; or sen=\r\nse of devotion in the mind and are merely a physical chanting. Are such jap=\r\nas unfruitful?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Is there some way to=\r\n validate that the japa shall actually bring certain merits or nullify the =\r\ntargeted evils? &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) How can an ordinar=\r\ny person determine whether the japa he is doing (or has done) is being done=\r\n in a proper manner? For example if there was some error in pronunciation o=\r\nr some nyasa was not performed correctly which invalidated the japa - can i=\r\nt be detected by the sadhaka himself by some means? &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4) There is a tradition of doing some nyasa etc before doing=\r\n mantras where deities are invited on various body parts. Do those deities =\r\nactually come and protect the entire process of Japa? Can one perceive thei=\r\nr presence in anyway - say maybe by observing a change in the aura around t=\r\nhe sadhaka?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with regards&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\r\n--1-1470416869-8265409645=:9--\r\n\n"}}
