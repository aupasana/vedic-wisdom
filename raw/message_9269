I know it is due to the time frame or Yug change =\r\nbut if we=A0consider=A0Vibhutis then we have lot of historical evidences be=\r\nside literature. Don&#39;t we believe that Avatar is a big phenomenon and beyon=\r\nd the scope of scriptures? because we have these scriptures transferred by =\r\none generation to another and might have some bias associated with them. I =\r\nam having little knowledge about this but what i feel is that we have many =\r\nversions of same SB or even epics like Ramayan or Mahabahrata.\nSomewhere i =\r\nlike the concept of evolutionary Avatars, if we consider our frame of refer=\r\nence as our present Universe this concept fits well. By the way if we look =\r\nbeyond this frame of reference it might be different story. My idea is the =\r\nframe of=A0reference is important in this context.=A0In my opinion=A0it may=\r\n be true that there are other &quot;Worlds&quot; as well which are beyond our imagina=\r\ntion or scope, Avatars are Phenomenon of this World, our frame or reference=\r\n, our universe. So it seems in a perfect alignment of evolution of our univ=\r\nerse.\nConsidering our evolution in present Kaliyug, it might be possible th=\r\nat Kalki Avatar will be more like a destroyer, i don&#39;t have words to explai=\r\nn here. I remember a picture at Raghunath temple in Jammu where Kalki avata=\r\nr is depicted like Surya or some thing similar. I hope if some one can shed=\r\n more light to this.\nWith my minuscule knowledge on this subject=A0i try to=\r\n add my two cents to this lovely discussion.\n=A0\nRegards\nAshish Agarwal\n\nFr=\r\nom: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Sunday, May 5, 2013 1:04 PM\nSubje=\r\nct: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Comparing Dasavataras!\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Narasimha,\n=A0=\r\n\nJai Ma!\n\n\nJust to clarify, I may have a special liking for Krshna, but my =\r\naim is obvious not to demean Rama, or any other special form of God.=A0Just=\r\n clarifying incase someone gets the wrong impression. I respect Rama, but I=\r\n worship Krshna.\n=A0\n&lt;&lt;More importantly, if your understanding is correct, =\r\nwhy isn&#39;t perfection occurring in the FINAL incarnation but occurring well =\r\nbefore?&gt;&gt;\n\nGood=A0question!=A0=A0\n=A0\nThat is because, SB is not concerned =\r\nwith the dasavatara. It lists 22 Avataras! It=A0deals with the idea of Avat=\r\naran, but not with the idea of 9/10 fixed Avataras.=A0It also=A0lists Varah=\r\na Avatara as the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya as the 10 in its list of 22. It is=\r\n only in other puranas, that we get the focus on 10 Avatars, and the term b=\r\necomes popular. \n=A0\nAnd ONLY when we take these 9/10 Avataras, in a fixed =\r\nsequence=A0of appearence, that we get the popular concept of Dasavatara. El=\r\nse no. I find the evolutionary link in this concept of 9/10 Avataras too co=\r\nmpelling to be ignored.=A0=A0\n=A0\n&lt;&lt;After all, &quot;entire divinity&quot; cannot be =\r\nencapsulated by any form&gt;&gt;\n\n\nThis, I am in total agreement with. Infact, in=\r\n the 10th Chapter of Gita when the Supreme explains the various vibhutis, t=\r\nhis One is not even Krshna, but has transcended every limitation of concept=\r\nion. Hence, the One says, among those who weild weapons, it is Rama, and am=\r\nong the Vrishnis it is Krshna! Etc..\n=A0\n&lt;&lt;First, he IS mentioned in SB lis=\r\nt of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;sch=\r\neme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and avata=\r\nras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.&gt;&gt;\n\nAs I said, the SB li=\r\nst contains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on the idea of 9/10 Avataras! Th=\r\nat is my point. If you take 22 Avataras, then these link to grahas are not =\r\nof any use. For these nine grahas, individually or in combination, will rep=\r\nresent all Avataras, or for that matter everything else in this Universe.\n=\r\n=A0\nSecondly, if we take 10 Avatars and corresponding grahas for each, then=\r\n what must Kalki be? Lagna? But=A0lagna is not a graha.\n=A0\nOr, just surmis=\r\ning, can it be possible that until an Avatara actually descends on the eart=\r\nh, his energy and his force cannot be attributed to any graha, but once he =\r\ndoes appear, it reconfigures things completely? We can only know after the =\r\nlast Avatara comes.\n=A0\nAnyway, I am not looking at this main Avatars from =\r\nthe point of grahas/jyotish at all. For that matter, some traditions consid=\r\ner Balarama to be an Avatara rather than Buddha.\n=A0\n=A0\nThe concept of Ava=\r\ntara and Vibhutis comes from the Gita. These two are slightly different. Av=\r\natara is a special descent of God, Paramatma, which appears on this world=\r\n=A0during times of severe crisis to=A0cause a drastic and fundamental=A0tra=\r\nnsition. A Vibhuti is a limited force of God which can appear to help out, =\r\ndirectly or indirectly, in any transition. A Vibuti need not be spiritual. =\r\nIt could be in any field of work.=A0Sometimes a Vibhuti may not even be awa=\r\nre of its purpose, unlike an Avatara.\n=A0\nBasically, whenever we see excell=\r\nence in any form, in any field, it is always the energy of the One at work.=\r\n.\n=A0\n-Regards\n=A0Rajarshi\n=A0\n=A0\n=A0\n\n\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mA=\r\nmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\nFrom: Naras=\r\nimha P.V.R.

More import=\r\nantly, if your understanding is correct, why isn&#39;t perfection occurring in =\r\nthe FINAL incarnation but occurring well before?\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nFirst, regarding Krishna being a &quot;poornavatar=\r\na&quot;, SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not say that Rama is not one. In fact, Paras=\r\nara, father of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha an=\r\nd Varaha are &quot;poornavataras&quot; (used that exact expression) while other avata=\r\nras have some amount of jivatmamsa too (though paramatmamsa dominates jivat=\r\nmamsa).\n=A0\nSecondly, after describing the avataras, SB says that there are=\r\n in fact innumerable avataras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods e=\r\ntc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then =\r\nproceeds to say &quot;these avataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself.=\r\n&quot; I question if the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama=\r\n is not is accurate! It only seems to say that all these rishis, manus, dem=\r\nigods etc are partial. As I said above, Pararsara explicitly said that both=\r\n Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.\n=A0\nThird, let us ask a very fundament=\r\nal question: What exactly does it mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n=A0=\r\n\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nWhile SB talks of Kris=\r\nhna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supre=\r\nme Lord, who is in reality formless (arUpa) and of the nature of pure consc=\r\niousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualities of Maya&quot;. In the ne=\r\nxt verse, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in ai=\r\nr. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contai=\r\nns* forms and is beyond them. So, again, what is the meaning of a specific =\r\nform that descended on earth being &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I am afraid people may b=\r\ne misinterpreting this notion based on their fancies and conditioning..\n=A0=\r\n\nAll beings are made up of paramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (=\r\nliving/relative being). The latter portion is dominant in us and is respons=\r\nible for desires and rebirth. Great avataras descend from a higher portion =\r\nof paramatma. Very rarely avataras descend entirely from paramatma without =\r\nANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna are specific examples given by Parasa=\r\nra.\n=A0\nThey are entirely divine, but they do not encapsulate the entire di=\r\nvinity!!!! After all, &quot;entire divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form =\r\njust as no cloud can contain the entire sky. They take part in the drama ob=\r\neying and executing the divine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Kr=\r\nishna as well as Rama.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=\r\n=A0\n&gt; Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not\n&gt; see hi=\r\nm fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His\n&gt; realization, the one he =\r\nadvocated, is a static realization,\n&gt; an end in a void.\n=A0\nFirst, he IS me=\r\nntioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;=\r\nfit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibl=\r\ny wrong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.\n=A0\nSe=\r\ncondly, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies log=\r\nical mind and the spirit of investigation and comprehension. Logical mind a=\r\nnd its spirit of comprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfected sp=\r\nirit of comprehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality compl=\r\netely, for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Inco=\r\nmprehensible in an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doin=\r\ng. However, logical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Ka=\r\nli yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this wo=\r\nrld in this age.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nIf=\r\n you dismiss Parasara&#39;s linking of planets to avataras as a possible corrup=\r\ntion, are you absolutely sure that the verses of SB you are relying on are =\r\nperfect? (In any case, it&#39;s a different matter that you are only taking som=\r\ne SB verses and ignoring some as I showed!.)\n=A0\nThe bottomline as far as I=\r\n am concerned is that Pararsara&#39;s list actually makes amazingly coherent es=\r\noteric sense. The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spi=\r\nrit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit of patience & persistence, Venus - sp=\r\nirit of happiness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara DOES have a h=\r\nighly meaningful connection, esoterically speaking. After all, esoterically=\r\n is how you really need to understand any higher scriptures and notions in =\r\nthem.\n=A0\nIf we take scriptures literally instead and draw lopsided conclus=\r\nions, some would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities=\r\n are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and ot=\r\nher deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nOn a different note, someone may think that Kali, bei=\r\nng Aadyaa, is superior to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis =\r\nhave declared them to be essentially the same and some scriptures even proh=\r\nibited differentiating between them. As I see it, the difference between th=\r\nem is too subtle for even rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing some =\r\nsignificant difference between them are, I am afraid, merely projecting the=\r\nir own conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were=A0 per=\r\nfectly detached and fully divine karma yogis.\n=A0\nIf we think about it, per=\r\nfected mind (paramatma aspect represented by Moon) and soul (paramatma aspe=\r\nct represented by Sun) are not really that different. So I am afraid Krishn=\r\na and Rama are not that different, though the specifics of their stories ma=\r\ny be different.\n=A0\nOne last word though. If someone truly believes that Kr=\r\nishna is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I am very =\r\nhappy for such a person. My arguments are more for the sake of sharing thin=\r\nking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of understanding in the long run,=\r\n than changing the minds of anyone in the short run. In the end, everyone o=\r\nf us will have to go through one&#39;s own cycles of various tamasik, rajasik a=\r\nnd saattwik stages of evolution before one starts grasping some fistfuls of=\r\n Reality. These concepts are too subtle for anyone to convince others or be=\r\n absolutely confident oneself!\n=A0\nKrishnarpanamastu, Narasimha -------- As=\r\ntrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n--------\n=\r\n\n=A0\n\nFrom: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;Sent: Saturday, May 4, 2013 7=\r\n:34 AM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Comparing Dasavataras!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt;Nam=\r\naste,\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Jai Ma!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I have a different view point. Let me write down =\r\nas I see it, in point by point manner.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;1. In the Bhagwata Purana, ther=\r\ne are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara i=\r\ns the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayan=\r\na,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes o=\r\nntu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, =\r\nVyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the Supr=\r\neme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;2. Of these various possi=\r\nble Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded special =\r\nmention and significance across various Hindu spiritual literature, special=\r\nly those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krs=\r\nhna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed the=\r\n full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. All =\r\nPuranas were composed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-Yu=\r\nga, as are Tantras]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of ap=\r\npearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krsh=\r\nna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form an=\r\nd sequence of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From =\r\nthe aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-=\r\nman, to the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes possessi=\r\non of this earth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara =\r\nof Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Ram=\r\na, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality=\r\n is not to be separated into another world, but is a progressive realizatio=\r\nn of the various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the cons=\r\nciousness and its development through various life-forms. Larger spirituali=\r\nty of earth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s grand design fo=\r\nr life on earth.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on the=\r\n parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one wo=\r\nrships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation of =\r\nthe soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata c=\r\nan lead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars o=\r\nf Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider super-massi=\r\nve spiritual dynamos.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are=\r\n most adored because they represent a stage of evolution, both inside as we=\r\nll as outside, which society can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama r=\r\nepresents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in contr=\r\nol of itself. It known how to transform the animal tendencies within and wi=\r\nthout - monkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose. However,=\r\n as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even though f=\r\new, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will change only when circ=\r\numstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected =\r\nwhile searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear before t=\r\nhe final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later r=\r\nevealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Rama=\r\n tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to r=\r\nescue her, but it was\n the Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family honour=\r\n. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, family honor. The way =\r\nI look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki=\r\n for representing the things as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an obs=\r\nerver, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years o=\r\nf tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into his killing Ravana, he =\r\nchanged into the most dispassionate leader, such that no personal considera=\r\ntion or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a les=\r\nson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detach=\r\nment right from birth. I am not taking his=A0 supernatural feats into accou=\r\nnt. It is his singular and constant detachment from situations, from people=\r\n, from environment, from circumstances that mark his life. At the age of ei=\r\nght, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foste=\r\nr parents, his\n village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it wo=\r\nuld make no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his hap=\r\npy, settled village life and head into an unknown destiny and destination. =\r\nKrshna tried to reason with them, then he understood that they won&#39;t unders=\r\ntand, he promised he will return back once his work in Mathura is over. He =\r\nnever returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to=\r\n participate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them starte=\r\nd getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from=\r\n the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has any s=\r\npecial right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept=\r\n dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th =\r\nabuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala&#39;s head and was back into his =\r\npoise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionis=\r\nt and\n charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to thi=\r\nnk of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed=\r\n his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the ene=\r\nmies off. The very next moment he was back into his own poised self. Never =\r\nin the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his going overboard, neve=\r\nr a single shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his =\r\nactions, irrespective of what others say or think of him. And then right in=\r\n the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the=\r\n most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the best i=\r\ndeal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be deject=\r\ned. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the results belong to the inst=\r\nrument. When running away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, =\r\nor when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema to\n h=\r\nit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna,=\r\n as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be li=\r\nned up which would cause the destruction of these people. This kind of know=\r\nledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens when one is constan=\r\ntly and consciously connected to the Universal Force. We do not find these =\r\nkind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ram=\r\nayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary t=\r\nexts and retelling, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we =\r\nhave a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sit=\r\na turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama wors=\r\nhips her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture=\r\n that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Theref=\r\nore he displays all the great characteristics of satwa, chief of\n which is =\r\nself-control, as well as the occasional sadness caused due to separation fr=\r\nom his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very d=\r\nearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief when =\r\nthe stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anyth=\r\ning in this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore=\r\n he was never affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left=\r\n him even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual forc=\r\ne in this world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Ava=\r\ntars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization, an en=\r\nd in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find t=\r\nhis not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them nega=\r\nted this world. If negation of this world and life is the final aim, then w=\r\nhy send so many avatars at crucial stages of evolutionary\n development? If =\r\nthe spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, t=\r\nhen why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense=\r\n. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of =\r\nNarayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava trad=\r\nitions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realizat=\r\nion, to be complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside =\r\nof life as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed their own=\r\n kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore=\r\n an object of reverence and realization. 7. The original literature of the =\r\nNath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological fu=\r\nnctions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most=\r\n people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - exclud=\r\ning Buddha - correspond to the full power and force\n of one of these 9 Chak=\r\nras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or all=\r\now the consciousness to explore and express itself is various possiblities,=\r\n are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore=\r\n the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in numbe=\r\nr. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment on whi=\r\nch graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS s=\r\nays, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one canno=\r\nt rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual misrepre=\r\nsentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not ye=\r\nt appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora =\r\nbooks, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is only one thing which is pe=\r\nrfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living=\r\n in the full and complete purity and might\n and force and strength of the A=\r\ntmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away oppos=\r\ning forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna =\r\nused diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kal=\r\nki, I am speculating, won&#39;t even need that. The white horse and that sword =\r\nis a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify the variou=\r\ns errors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, this is how I look at th=\r\ne story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I a=\r\nm reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth. -Regards =\r\n=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwa=\r\nmajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;From: Narasimha P.V.R.

A learned friend wrote =\r\nthat &quot;Krshna is the God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stag=\r\ne&quot; and &quot;Buddha after Krshna is like going back from the linear progression =\r\nof spirituality that the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshna&quot;.=\r\n =A0 I want to emphatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a =\r\n&quot;linear progression of spirituality..upto Krshna&quot;. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Each avatara represents an aspect of Supre=\r\nme in a perfected form. =A0 Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with plan=\r\nets. For example, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respe=\r\nctively. =A0 We also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Sa=\r\nturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/d=\r\nrive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being hap=\r\npy, patience/discipline,\n spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detach=\r\nment (respectively). =A0 Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of =\r\nthat aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how=\r\n that aspect operates. =A0 Lord Rama&#39;s story is a perfected example of how =\r\nsoul operates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected example of how mind oper=\r\nates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discriminati=\r\non operates. Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a perfected example of how energy/dr=\r\nive/initiative operates. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =\r\n* =A0 Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy =\r\nin us, learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/pat=\r\nience in us - all these are different manifestations of the same Self. Howe=\r\nver, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has different quali=\r\nties and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them. =A0 We=\r\n MAY focus on one aspect of us first,\n perfect it and then perfect other as=\r\npects through it. But, we need balance between all aspects in the end. Simi=\r\nlarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable and are in=\r\n a balance working together in the Cosmos. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may=\r\n like the story that demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated =\r\nby the qualities of mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind oper=\r\nates, and one who is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the sto=\r\nry that demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a mat=\r\nter of taste and subjective preference. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind.=\r\n Soul is seen as a representative of god in us, because of some basic attri=\r\nbutes of it. It is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes=\r\n. =A0 Once mind fancies a separate existence with some\n agendas/desires, so=\r\nul supports the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and s=\r\nees it as its dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this=\r\n individualized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning abili=\r\nty, enjoyment, discipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desir=\r\nes/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and recor=\r\nds all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruit=\r\ns later on. It does all that despite full awareness that it is neither doin=\r\ng those karmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the i=\r\nndividualized consciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things=\r\n and begetting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees t=\r\nhat as its dharma and does it impassionately. =A0 Now, does this sound exci=\r\nting? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness sup=\r\nporting the play, may not seem interesting enough\n to some. =A0 On the othe=\r\nr hand, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing tho=\r\nse agendas, getting things and achieving things. Movement of mind is what k=\r\neeps the individualization going!!! Though soul is the support for everythi=\r\nng else in the individualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dh=\r\narma impassionately. It is mind that keeps the individualization going and =\r\nbrings in agendas and passion and even decides/affects every entity&#39;s dharm=\r\na. That way, mind is really the &quot;boss&quot; of the individualization. No wonder =\r\nKrishna&#39;s life appeals more to one who may be excited by this description! =\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Lord Krishna is obv=\r\niously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in perspective. =A0 Rama&#39;s=\r\n life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma Jn=\r\nana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was his &quot;dharm=\r\na&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given\n kingdom. At t=\r\nhe last moment, his father banished him to forest at the behest of his step=\r\n-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had no complaints. Th=\r\nough his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty to various degree=\r\ns, he himself supported and consoled all three and followed his dharma impa=\r\nssionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest with Lakshmana and go=\r\ning after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately wh=\r\nen Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her and=\r\n fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or f=\r\naulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every life situation wi=\r\nth no complaints and did the best possible action then. Even as he killed R=\r\navana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma. E=\r\nven as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some subje=\r\ncts that were going to disappear with Ravana! =A0 Rama\n is a perfect exampl=\r\ne of a liberated man with no desires or agendas who impassionately discharg=\r\nes one&#39;s dharma arising from the momentum of karmas before liberation. THAT=\r\n is basically what soul does! =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 * =A0 As another example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is =\r\na perfect demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates. =A0 He was b=\r\norn as a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a chari=\r\ntable demon king with many great qualities. =A0 Wisdom/discrimination makes=\r\n one humble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with de=\r\nmonic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not ple=\r\nased until that pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire conscio=\r\nusness, then demonic qualities are completely suppressed. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 Please think about the other avatara=\r\ns. The stories can be understood as perfect demonstrations of how various a=\r\nspects of\n our consciousness operate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara=\r\n. =A0 Let us not compare Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them separately=\r\n. Of course, if you are more attracted to one of them, please think about t=\r\nhat avatara more and develop devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us=\r\n from samsara. =A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0 By t=\r\nhe way, happy Hanumajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are dif=\r\nferent schools of thought). =A0 Best regards, Narasimha -------- Astrology =\r\n& Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org -------- \n\n\n\n\r\n--756480036-1307502185-1367741815=:58735\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;RIGHT: =\r\nauto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Dear &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-0 class=3Dmark&gt;P=\r\nVR&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell-1 class=3Dmark&gt;Ji&lt;/SPAN&gt;, &lt;SPAN id=3Dmisspell=\r\n-2 class=3Dmark&gt;Rajarshi&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot; id=3Dmisspell-3=\r\n class=3Dmark&gt;Ji&lt;/SPAN&gt;,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Thanks for such thoughtful insights, i really love readin=\r\ng your mails on such misunderstood and thought provoking subjects.

If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in=\r\n your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong=\r\n and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;As I said, the SB list contains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on the ide=\r\na of 9/10 Avataras! That is my point. If you take 22 Avataras, then these l=\r\nink to grahas are not of any use.

More importantly, if your unde=\r\nrstanding is correct, why isn&#39;t perfection occurring in the FINAL incarnati=\r\non but occurring well before?&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Firs=\r\nt, regarding Krishna being a &quot;poornavatara&quot;, SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not=\r\n say that Rama is not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly m=\r\nentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poornavataras&quot; (used=\r\n that exact expression) while other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa=\r\n too (though paramatmamsa dominates\n jivatmamsa).&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Secondly, af=\r\nter describing the avataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable ava=\r\ntaras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supre=\r\nme Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say &quot;these a=\r\nvataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I question if the dedu=\r\nction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It =\r\nonly seems to say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. A=\r\ns I said above, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are po=\r\nornavataras.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Third, let us ask a very fundamental question: Wh=\r\nat exactly does it mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;While SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.=\r\n3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is in reality for=\r\nmless (arUpa) and of the\n nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are man=\r\nufactured by the qualities of Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it further compares=\r\n forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clo=\r\nuds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them.=\r\n So, again, what is the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth =\r\nbeing &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion=\r\n based on their fancies and conditioning..&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;All beings are made=\r\n up of paramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative bein=\r\ng). The latter portion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and=\r\n rebirth. Great avataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very r=\r\narely avataras descend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion.=\r\n Rama and Krishna are specific examples given by Parasara.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The=\r\ny are entirely divine, but they do not encapsulate the entire divinity!!!! =\r\nAfter all, &quot;entire\n divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no=\r\n cloud can contain the entire sky. They take part in the drama obeying and =\r\nexecuting the divine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna as w=\r\nell as Rama.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Buddha was great=\r\n spiritual force in this world. But I do not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; see him fit in the sch=\r\neme of evolutionary Avatars. His&lt;BR&gt;&gt; realization, the one he advocated,=\r\n is a static realization,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; an end in a void.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;First, he =\r\nIS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does =\r\nnot &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is po=\r\nssibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Secondly, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who p=\r\nersonifies logical mind and the spirit of investigation and comprehension. =\r\nLogical mind\n and its &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_136702521=\r\n5463_151&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&gt;spirit of c=\r\nomprehension are &lt;/SPAN&gt;inherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit of com=\r\nprehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for =\r\nit is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensibl=\r\ne in an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However,=\r\n logical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No=\r\n wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this world in this=\r\n age.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;If you dismiss Parasara&#39;s li=\r\nnking of planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely s=\r\nure that the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect? (In any case, it&#39;=\r\ns a different matter that you are only taking some SB verses and ignoring s=\r\nome as I\n showed!.)&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The bottomline as far as I am concerned is=\r\n that Pararsara&#39;s list actually makes amazingly coherent esoteric sense. Th=\r\ne nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehen=\r\nsion, Saturn - spirit of patience &amp; persistence, Venus - spirit of happ=\r\niness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meanin=\r\ngful connection, esoterically speaking. After all, esoterically is how you =\r\nreally need to understand any higher scriptures and notions in them.&lt;BR&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;BR&gt;If we take scriptures literally instead and draw lopsided conclusion=\r\ns, some would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities ar=\r\ne &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other=\r\n deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;On a different note, someone may think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superi=\r\nor\n to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declared them =\r\nto be essentially the same and some scriptures even prohibited differentiat=\r\ning between them. As I see it, the difference between them is too subtle fo=\r\nr even rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing some significant differe=\r\nnce between them are, I am afraid, merely projecting their own conditioning=\r\n. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were&nbsp; perfectly detached =\r\nand fully divine karma yogis.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;If we think about it, perfected =\r\nmind (paramatma &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_1=\r\n51&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&gt;aspect represente=\r\nd by &lt;/SPAN&gt;Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv147269216=\r\n1yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_136702=\r\n5215463_151&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_151&gt;represen=\r\nted by &lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;Sun) are not really that different. So I am afraid Kri=\r\nshna\n and Rama are not that different, though the specifics of their storie=\r\ns may be different.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;One last word though. If someone truly bel=\r\nieves that Krishna is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!=\r\n), I am very happy for such a person. My arguments are more for the sake of=\r\n sharing thinking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of understanding in =\r\nthe long run, than changing the minds of anyone in the short run. In the en=\r\nd, everyone of us will have to go through one&#39;s own cycles of various tamas=\r\nik, rajasik and saattwik stages of evolution before one starts grasping som=\r\ne fistfuls of Reality. These concepts are too subtle for anyone to convince=\r\n others or be absolutely confident oneself!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: arial=\r\n, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 13px&quot; id=3Dyi=\r\nv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_59 class=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_=\r\n1367025215463_58&gt;Krishnarpanamastu, Narasimha -------- Astrology &amp; Spir=\r\nituality Resources: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofol=\r\nlow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D=\r\n&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: transparent; FONT-STYLE: normal; FONT-FAMILY: arial, hel=\r\nvetica, clean, sans-serif; COLOR: rgb(0,0,0); FONT-SIZE: 13px&quot; id=3Dyiv1472=\r\n692161yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_61 class=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_13670=\r\n25215463_60&gt;--------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot; id=3Dyiv147269216=\r\n1yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_171&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_13=\r\n67025215463_63&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid;=\r\n RIGHT: auto&quot; id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_66&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; FONT-SIZE: 10pt&quot; id=3Dyiv147=\r\n2692161yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_180 class=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_136=\r\n7025215463_70&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times,=\r\n serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot; id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_179 c=\r\nlass=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_71&gt;\n&lt;DIV dir=3Dltr id=3Dyiv1=\r\n472692161yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_178&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM: #ccc =\r\n1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; LINE-HEIGHT: 0=\r\n; MARGIN: 5px 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; HEIGHT: 0px; FONT=\r\n-SIZE: 0px; BORDER-TOP: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDI=\r\nNG-TOP: 0px&quot; class=3Dyiv1472692161hr&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_=\r\n2_64_1367025215463_177 size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;&lt;B id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2=\r\n_64_1367025215463_176&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot; id=3Dyiv1472692161y=\r\nui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_175&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi1=\r\n4@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_215&gt;&lt;S=\r\nPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot; id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_136702521546=\r\n3_214&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Sat=\r\nurday, May 4, 2013 7:34 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:=\r\n&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Comparing\n Dasavataras!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot; id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_1367025215463_192 cl=\r\nass=3Dyiv1472692161y_msg_container&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot; id=3Dyiv=\r\n1472692161&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot; id=3Dyiv1472692161yui_3_7_2_64_13670=\r\n25215463_191&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot; id=3Dyiv147269=\r\n2161ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff; FONT-FAMILY: Courier N=\r\new, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif; C\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
