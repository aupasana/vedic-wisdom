The same is the case with the soul. Projected fr=\r\nom Brahman, it passed through all sorts of vegetable and animal forms, and =\r\nat last it is in man, and man is the nearest approach to Brahman. To go bac=\r\nk to Brahman from which we have been projected is the great struggle of lif=\r\ne.\n\n\n"}}
