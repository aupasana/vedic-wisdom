Just a couple =\r\nof more questions. How often should I plan to get the chimney professionall=\r\ny cleaned? I plan to do this Homam every Sunday, whenever possible. \n\nAlso,=\r\n in the way you do / prescribe, I see that you are only using one spoon to =\r\nput the ghee in the homam. Don&#39;t you use the Shruk and Shruvam? Because tha=\r\nt is how I learnt it in the Chatushpatra Prayogam! It seems there is a Shat=\r\npatra prayogam also. The Priest who taught me these said that these are the=\r\n two methods of performing homam according to the Apasthambha Sutram.\n\n\nReg=\r\nards, \n\nNagraj\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot;=\r\n &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Pradakshinam (going around the homa kun=\r\ndam) is not necessary.\n&gt; \n&gt; Doing homam in a one-side open wood burning fir=\r\neplace is perfectly \n&gt; acceptable and many priests do that way in US. I per=\r\nsonally have a custom \n&gt; built 4-side open 2 ft x 2 ft x 1ft deep homa kund=\r\nam with a chimney going \n&gt; up, supported by 4 pillars on 4 sides. I do homa=\r\nm in it using wood and with \n&gt; big fire. The video was not shot using that =\r\nset up, as I wanted to \n&gt; demonstrate a setup that would work for most peop=\r\nle.\n&gt; \n&gt; Several people in US are doing without using wood and using only d=\r\nry coconut \n&gt; pieces. That minimizes smoke and there is considerable smoke =\r\nonly at the \n&gt; end. Before smoke comes at the end, they move the homa kunda=\r\nm and put it \n&gt; under an exhaust fan in kitchen or outside. That minimizes =\r\nthe smoke.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you have a wood burning fireplace, I suggest placing a c=\r\nopper homa kundam \n&gt; inside the fireplace and doing homam in it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Modak=\r\nas are perfectly acceptable in Ganapathi homam if one has fire big \n&gt; enoug=\r\nh to completely burn them. If one is doing homam with a few dry coconut \n&gt; =\r\npieces, one cannot burn modakas. Homam can be performed before or after \n&gt; =\r\nsunrise on any day. But the one hour before and after sunrise is a really \n=\r\n&gt; really good time for homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Important thing is that you should have =\r\nfaith and devotion. Outside of the \n&gt; homam time, keep watching your though=\r\nts and actions, identify egoistic \n&gt; motives behind them and suppress the e=\r\ngoistic instincts. Homam will aid in \n&gt; that process and that process will =\r\nhelp you do a better homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam You=\r\nrself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.=\r\ncomcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri =\r\nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original =\r\nMessage ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, November 18, 2009 12:28 PM\n&gt; Subject: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] homam questions\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Sri Narasimhagaru,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thank =\r\nyour for your response on Spiritual advice directing me to do \n&gt; &gt; Ganapath=\r\ni Homam. I am going to follow the advice. Anyway, I have some \n&gt; &gt; other qu=\r\nestions now. I have learnt how to perform Ganapathi Homam and \n&gt; &gt; Gayatri =\r\nHomam from our local priest (we used to call him Sharmaji. He is \n&gt; &gt; no lo=\r\nnger here and moved to Texas) here in Michigan. He taught me a \n&gt; &gt; procedu=\r\nre called &quot;Chatushpatra Prayogam&quot; that I use for these Homams. I \n&gt; &gt; have =\r\nalso reviewed your pdf files, the audio mp3s and videos for many \n&gt; &gt; homam=\r\ns that have been described in your site and noticed that your \n&gt; &gt; document=\r\ns do include what Our priest taught and more. So, I am thinking of \n&gt; &gt; fol=\r\nlowing your procedure. Also, Our Sharmaji used to perform the homam in \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n our Wood Burning Fire Place. From your video, I understand that you are \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; doing it in open, in a room. How do you control Smoke so that it won&#39;t \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; darken the ceiling and the walls? Is it ok to do it in Wood Burning fir=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; place? The only problem I see in doing it in fireplace is that I can=\r\nnot do \n&gt; &gt; pradakshinam to the fire (in case that is needed), and it is no=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; convenient to reach back of the homa kundam to put the darbhas and o=\r\nther \n&gt; &gt; puja materials. Also more than one Ritvik cannot do the homam in =\r\ncase I am \n&gt; &gt; involving other people. How much do these matter? One other =\r\nprocedure our \n&gt; &gt; Sharmaji instructed is that it is preferable that Ganapa=\r\nthi homam be \n&gt; &gt; performed on Shukla Chaturthi and before the sunrise and =\r\nhe said that we \n&gt; &gt; should put modakas in the fire. What do you say about =\r\nthose aspects. I \n&gt; &gt; know purity of mind and sincerety in performing this =\r\nritual is of \n&gt; &gt; paramount importance than the ritualistic details, but I =\r\nwant to follow \n&gt; &gt; the prescribed procedures to the extent possible.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
