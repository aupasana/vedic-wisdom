The forefathers of the Vijayanagara king Kr=\r\nishnadevaraya.\n\n\nWhy do we have to question what the peetadhipathis or guru=\r\ns are doing .Nature has its own ways of doing things and their own good kar=\r\nma has given them that role  and what they do  need not follow the black an=\r\nd white convoluted logic or political correctness expected by us.\n\nRegards\n=\r\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy=\r\n &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear KK,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Great question!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n Also, I personally do not agree that a saint cannot interfere in the polit=\r\nical situation of a country.
