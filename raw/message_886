As I said \n  earli=\r\ner, it is possible to achieve the one-pointed focus of mind on any \n  combi=\r\nnation of sounds. When one&#39;s mind repeats the same combination of \n  sounds=\r\n over and over again, eventually one&#39;s mind may lose all other \n  thoughts =\r\nand become absorbed in that combination of sounds. THEN one&#39;s mind \n  exper=\r\niences the energy represented by that combination of sounds.\n\n  Different c=\r\nombinations of sounds have different energies. But experiencing \n  the ener=\r\ngy of any combination of sounds is a better experience for the mind \n  than=\r\n the regular chaotic experiences mind has in a cacaphony of thoughts.\n\n  Th=\r\ne energy represented by properly chanted Veda mantras is in a different \n  =\r\nleague. However, it is almost impossible to chant Veda mantras perfectly in=\r\n \n  today&#39;s times. The knowledge is lost. The way people chant them, veda \n=\r\n  mantras get corrupted and they end up working like other mantras and do n=\r\not \n  really act as veda mantras. Even if one experiences a veda mantra, on=\r\ne \n  experiences the energy of a corrupted version and not of the original =\r\nveda \n  mantra.\n\n  The expression &quot;Om bhur bhuvah suvah/svah&quot; is not part o=\r\nf the actual savitru \n  gayatri mantra. The actual veda mantra starts with =\r\n&quot;tat savitur&quot; and ends \n  with &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n\n  I never recorded an audio=\r\n clip of my Gayatri chanting. I only hummed the ups \n  and downs to show th=\r\ne intonation. I was instructed to never chant Savitru \n  Gayatri mantra lou=\r\nd. Spiritually speaking, that mantra is my food and I get \n  whatever littl=\r\ne energy I have from it. In order to continue doing my dharma \n  in the wor=\r\nld, I will need to be selfish with my food. I can share everything \n  else =\r\nwith the world.\n\n  Astrology knowledge that we have on earth today is insuf=\r\nficient to give \n  perfect guidance. A good guru may be able to do a better=\r\n job than astrology \n  as we understand it.\n\n  I have seen my guru make som=\r\ne interesting mantra suggestions. For example, I \n  once mentioned to Manis=\r\nh a friend who visits me often and meditates when I \n  do homam. Manish sai=\r\nd, &quot;he will not be interested in doing homam by himself. \n  If at all he do=\r\nes, it will not be Mahaganapathi homam or Chandi homam. Teach \n  him Vishnu=\r\n sahasra naama homam. He MAY be interested in that. He will like \n  Vishnu =\r\nsahasra naama stotram.&quot; I had not mentioned much about that person to \n  Ma=\r\nnish and only said the name. Interestingly, Vishnu sahasra naama stotra is =\r\n\n  indeed a favorite prayer of that person. Another time, I met a person wh=\r\no \n  loves Ganapathi atharva seersham and chants it everyday and interested=\r\n in \n  doing Mahaganapathi homam. Manish told me, &quot;if he wants, he can do \n=\r\n  Mahaganapathi homam. But eventually there is another sadhana he needs to =\r\ndo. \n  He needs to chant Hanuman Chalisa everyday 108 or 54 times for one w=\r\nhole \n  year. It will transform his life.&quot; I had not mentioned anything abo=\r\nut that \n  person to Manish. Interestingly, when this person was young, he =\r\nwas a sishya \n  of a great spiritual master in the lineage of Sadguru Samar=\r\ntha Ramadas \n  (considered to be born with Lord Hanuman&#39;s amsa). He said to=\r\n me later that \n  his guru had also advised him in the past to just stick t=\r\no Hanuman chalisa! \n  Interestingly, the same suggestion came to Manish&#39;s m=\r\nind.\n\n  Of course, Manish tells me at other times that he knows nothing and=\r\n says \n  whatever comes to his mind. If he ends up giving correct guidance =\r\nto \n  someone, he says it is because the Mother wanted someone to get corre=\r\nct \n  guidance and he is just a nimitta.\n\n  I believe that a sadguru with v=\r\nery limited individual ego and in tune with \n  Nature will be able to give =\r\nfar better guidance in spiritual sadhana than \n  astrology as we know it to=\r\nday.\n\n  For Mars and Rahu in 8th, I can suggest Lord Subrahmanya.\n\n  Best r=\r\negards,\n  Narasimha\n  -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n  Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n  D=\r\no Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n  Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Free Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n  Free Jyotish software (Windows): =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n  Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagannath.org\n  ---------------------------------------------------=\r\n------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakum=\r\na@...&gt;\n  To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n  Sent: Sunday, January 0=\r\n4, 2009 3:45 AM\n  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] gayatri mantra\n\n  &gt; dear narasimh=\r\na ji and friends,\n  &gt; namaste!\n  &gt;\n  &gt; i understand that the syllables / me=\r\ntre of the mantra is very\n  &gt; important. that is why (probably) mantra was =\r\npassed on from the guru\n  &gt; to ths sishya by word of mouth. somebody even s=\r\naid that in the end\n  &gt; it is the metre only that remains in the mantra...a=\r\nnd not even the\n  &gt; words. something like the smile of the cheshire cat rem=\r\naining even\n  &gt; when the cat itself vanishes in alice in the wonderland.\n  =\r\n&gt;\n  &gt; i too have been looking at / bringing to my consciousness the\n  &gt; gay=\r\natri mantra of late. for lack of guidance, i have been relying on\n  &gt; the i=\r\nnternet. the first thing that kind of took my breath away was\n  &gt; the layer=\r\ns and layers of meaning attached to each word of the\n  &gt; mantra. that is pr=\r\nobably because all sanskrit words are like\n  &gt; that....you peel one layer a=\r\nnd another layer lies below..and then\n  &gt; still another and another....\n  &gt;=\r\n\n  &gt; but more importantly (perhaps) is the different ways this mantra\n  &gt; g=\r\nets recited. i tried to count the syllables to see whether they\n  &gt; added u=\r\npto 24. they almost did, to my recknoning, but i wasn&#39;t sure\n  &gt; whether om=\r\n in the beginning is part of the mantra or not. it probaly\n  &gt; is, but i wa=\r\nnt to be sure.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; secondly, depending on who chants the mantra, the wo=\r\nrds\n  &gt; are &quot;spelt&quot; / &quot;pronounced&quot; differently. For instance in one\n  &gt; ren=\r\ndering i found &quot;swah&quot; being pronounced as &quot;suvah&quot; which becomes\n  &gt; two syl=\r\nlables instead of one. simarly, in the same\n  &gt; rendering &quot;prachodyat&quot; is s=\r\ntretched to 3 syllables instead of 2.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; so i am confused as to the &quot;r=\r\night&quot; rendition.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; i recall, quite some time back, narsimha ji had po=\r\nsted his rendition\n  &gt; of the gayatri mantra in an audio clip. i have not b=\r\neen able to find\n  &gt; it again. but i wish he or someone could guide me abou=\r\nt this.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; i would also like to know the importance of the number of s=\r\nyllables\n  &gt; in each mantra and how this is suitable for different persons\n=\r\n  &gt; depending on their &quot;karmic structures&quot; which are sometimes / always\n  &gt;=\r\n (?) reflected in the astrological chart. maybe a guru by just\n  &gt; looking =\r\nat a person can know intuitively what is the &quot;right&quot; mantra\n  &gt; for the per=\r\nson. maybe a good astrologer can also do the same.\n  &gt;\n  &gt; i know this is n=\r\not an astrology forum, but still i am seeking\n  &gt; guidance on &quot;appeasement&quot;=\r\n of mars and rahu in 8th house and retro\n  &gt; saturn in 6th house for taurus=\r\n lagna...throough mantra.

If he ends up giving =\r\ncorrect guidance \n  to &lt;BR&gt;someone, he says it is because the Mother wanted=\r\n someone to get correct \n  &lt;BR&gt;guidance and he is just a nimitta.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I =\r\nbelieve that a sadguru with \n  very limited individual ego and in tune with=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;Nature will be able to give \n  far better guidance in spiritual sadhan=\r\na than &lt;BR&gt;astrology as we know it \n  today.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For Mars and Rahu in 8t=\r\nh, I can suggest Lord \n  Subrahmanya.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best \n  regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;------------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR=\r\n&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;-&lt;BR&gt;Do \n  a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;WBR&gt;rologer.org/&lt;WBR&gt;homam&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do \n  Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;WBR&gt;rologer.org/&lt;WBR&gt;tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spi=\r\nrituality: \n  &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;htt=\r\np://groups.&lt;WBR&gt;yahoo.com/&lt;WBR&gt;group/vedic-&lt;WBR&gt;wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \n  Jyoti=\r\nsh lessons (MP3): &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;http://=\r\nvedicastro.&lt;WBR&gt;home.comcast.&lt;WBR&gt;net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \n  Jyotish software (Wind=\r\nows): &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;WBR=\r\n&gt;rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri \n  Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://www.SriJagannath.org&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;WBR&gt;nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--------=\r\n----&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;WBR&gt;---------&lt;=\r\nWBR&gt;- \n  &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;=\r\n&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:vinitakuma%40gmail.com&quot;&gt;vinitakuma@gmail.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;To: \n  &lt;&lt;A \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@&lt;WBR&gt;yahoogroups.&lt;WBR&gt;com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: \n  Sunday, January 04, =\r\n2009 3:45 AM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] gayatri \n  mantra&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dear =\r\nnarasimha ji and friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  namaste!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; i understand =\r\nthat the syllables / metre of the mantra \n  is very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; important. that=\r\n is why (probably) mantra was passed on from \n  the guru&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to ths sis=\r\nhya by word of mouth. somebody even said that in \n  the end&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it is t=\r\nhe metre only that remains in the mantra...and not even \n  the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; word=\r\ns. something like the smile of the cheshire cat remaining \n  even&lt;BR&gt;&gt; w=\r\nhen the cat itself vanishes in alice in the \n  wonderland.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ni too have been looking at / bringing to my \n  consciousness the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ga=\r\nyatri mantra of late. for lack of guidance, i have \n  been relying on&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; the internet. the first thing that kind of took my \n  breath away was&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; the layers and layers of meaning attached to each word \n  of the&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; mantra. that is probably because all sanskrit words are \n  like&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n that....you peel one layer and another layer lies below..and \n  then&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; still another and another....&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; but more \n  importantly (p=\r\nerhaps) is the different ways this mantra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; gets recited. \n  i tried =\r\nto count the syllables to see whether they&lt;BR&gt;&gt; added upto 24. they \n  a=\r\nlmost did, to my recknoning, but i wasn&#39;t sure&lt;BR&gt;&gt; whether om in the \n =\r\n beginning is part of the mantra or not. it probaly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is, but i want =\r\nto \n  be sure.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; secondly, depending on who chants the mantra=\r\n, the \n  words&lt;BR&gt;&gt; are &quot;spelt&quot; / &quot;pronounced&quot; differently. For instance=\r\n in \n  one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; rendering i found &quot;swah&quot; being pronounced as &quot;suvah&quot; whi=\r\nch \n  becomes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; two syllables instead of one. simarly, in the same&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n  rendering &quot;prachodyat&quot; is stretched to 3 syllables instead of \n  2=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; so i am confused as to the &quot;right&quot; \n  rendition.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; i recall, quite some time back, narsimha ji had \n  posted his rendi=\r\ntion&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of the gayatri mantra in an audio clip. i have \n  not been abl=\r\ne to find&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it again. but i wish he or someone could guide \n  me abou=\r\nt this.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; i would also like to know the importance of the \n  =\r\nnumber of syllables&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in each mantra and how this is suitable for \n  =\r\ndifferent persons&lt;BR&gt;&gt; depending on their &quot;karmic structures&quot; which are =\r\n\n  sometimes / always&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (?) reflected in the astrological chart. mayb=\r\ne a \n  guru by just&lt;BR&gt;&gt; looking at a person can know intuitively what i=\r\ns the \n  &quot;right&quot; mantra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; for the person. maybe a good astrologer can=\r\n also do the \n  same.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; i know this is not an astrology forum=\r\n, but still i am \n  seeking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; guidance on &quot;appeasement&quot; of mars and r=\r\nahu in 8th house and \n  retro&lt;BR&gt;&gt; saturn in 6th house for taurus lagna.=\r\n..throough mantra. \n  These&lt;BR&gt;&gt; planets aspect all the other planets (j=\r\nupiter, sun and mercury \n  in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2nd house and venus moon in third hou=\r\nse).&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  thankyou!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; love and best wishes,&#39;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n  vinita&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;!--End group email --&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY=\r\n&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0029_01C97115.ABF06480--\r\n\n"}}
