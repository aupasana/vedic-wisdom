For some this may sound like an empty question. Science has\nshaped our a=\r\nge; religion is a declining force in the West, as it has been\nfor decades. =\r\nA clock could be placed behind every pulpit, ticking off the\nthousands of p=\r\neople who leave organised faith behind, every hour of the\nday. But there is=\r\n a growing movement that is repairing the rift between\nscience and religion=\r\n. It has nothing to do with the noisy band of atheists\nwho continue to fome=\r\nnt discord between faith and reason. Rather, science\nhas reached a point wh=\r\nere certain basic mysteries cannot be solved without\nresorting to the one t=\r\nhing that\nspirituality&lt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/spiritualit=\r\ny&gt;\nhas\nalways specialised in: consciousness.\n\nScience is dominated by mater=\r\nialism, a worldview that traces all activity,\nincluding our imagination and=\r\n creativity, to physical processes in the\nbrain, and these processes are ei=\r\nther chemically determined or random,\ndepending on which strain of material=\r\nism you confront. Spirituality, which\nis much broader than religion, is bas=\r\ned on the assumption that a\ntranscendent reality exists beyond the physical=\r\n world. This is the domain\nof higher consciousness, or if you are conventio=\r\nnally minded, the home of\nthe soul and God.\n\nTo find a common ground could =\r\nbe difficult but one can try. The annual\nSages and Scientists Symposium org=\r\nanised by the Chopra Foundation seeks to\ndo just that by bringing together =\r\nphilosophers and scientists who are\nsympathetic with the search for a singl=\r\ne reality that embraces science and\nwisdom. The worldwide financial meltdow=\r\nn is matched by a cultural pandemic\nof confusion and a desperate search for=\r\n deeper values. A groundswell of\nknowledge and insight has been building. I=\r\nts shared message is this: There\nis something else, a dimension of reality =\r\nbeyond the material world. Beyond\nus, but in our midst.\n\nScientists who are=\r\n willing to venture into speculative thinking, joined by\nsages from the wor=\r\nld&#39;s wisdom traditions, who are willing to look beyond\narguments about God,=\r\n face the same primal questions. Where did the\nuniverse&lt;http://timesofindia=\r\n.indiatimes.com/topic/Universe&gt; come\nfrom? What preceded the Big\nBang&lt;http:=\r\n//timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/Big-Bang&gt;,\nbefore there was either &quot;whe=\r\nre&quot; or &quot;when&quot;? A century after the quantum\nrevolution in Physics, science h=\r\nas to face up to the vanishing act that the\nphysical universe pulled, as ma=\r\ntter and energy were both seen to emerge\nfrom a timeless state that is eith=\r\ner an empty void (which no one accepts)\nor a field of infinite possibilitie=\r\ns, a veritable womb of creation (which\nalmost everyone is beginning to acce=\r\npt, however offended science may be by\nlearning that the world&#39;s ancient sa=\r\nges and spiritual teachers knew about\nthis timeless domain long before Phys=\r\nics arrived with its exact measuring\ndevices).\n\nThe reason that your future=\r\n and mine depends on the settling of these\nquestions isn&#39;t what you might t=\r\nhink. Science can proceed perfectly well in\neveryday affairs without thinki=\r\nng about &quot;metaphysics,&quot; as materialists like\nto call spirituality. For its =\r\npart, spirituality can keep appealing to\nindividuals, one at a time as they=\r\n arrive at personal crises, revelations,\nand awakenings. But what will be s=\r\nhortchanged is reality. Ultimately,\nworldviews are secondary. If X believes=\r\n in Buddha and Y in thermodynamics,\ntheir two worlds can sit uneasily next =\r\nto each other or simply not\ninteract. But reality is a shared concern. It&#39;s=\r\n also a topic we can&#39;t\nafford to leave to specialists. Where the cosmos cam=\r\ne from means a great\ndeal, because the answer will tell you where the human=\r\n mind came from, and\nwhere it&#39;s going.\n\nIs the universe conscious? If so, t=\r\nhen our minds are embedded in the cosmic\nmind. Is the universe evolving? If=\r\n so, that casts human evolution in a new\nlight, along with the origin of li=\r\nfe. These are not specialist questions.\nThey go to the heart of the human c=\r\nondition.\n\nOur intention is not to pigeonhole anyone as sage or\nscientist&lt;h=\r\nttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/scientist&gt; or\nto join a camp &lt;http:=\r\n//timesofindia.indiatimes.com/topic/A-Camp&gt; for\nideological reasons. There =\r\nis a struggle going on between science and\nspirituality that will shape eve=\r\nryone&#39;s future, and if we each decide to\njoin in, a blending may occur with=\r\n magical consequences.
