Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Manoj,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In addition to fire, gods can be invoked in water as well as idols or any \n&gt;&gt; objects in general. In fact, gods can be invoked and worshipped in one&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; breathing. Gods can be worshipped without any external invocation also, \n&gt;&gt; as they have an indwelling presence always. However, external worship in \n&gt;&gt; fire gives the best results and useful for progressing for most sadhakas \n&gt;&gt; in the beginning.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Kurukshetra is the land of BhagavadGita and you are blessed to be from \n&gt;&gt; that sacred land. I and my guru spent a couple of days at Kurukshetra for \n&gt;&gt; shooting a documentary movie on Krishna&#39;s historicity in May 2008. That \n&gt;&gt; whole region is filled with some powerful and strange spiritual energy. \n&gt;&gt; We had a couple of really nice homams and meditation sessions in \n&gt;&gt; Kurukshetra. I loved the place.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Particularly, one Chandi homam we did in the night atop a small hill in \n&gt;&gt; Kurukshetra (Karna ka teela) was very nice. An old yogi and his grandson \n&gt;&gt; lived there and did sadhana everyday. They belonged to Naath pantha and \n&gt;&gt; were Gorakshaanaath (Gorakhnath) followers. When we were climbing the \n&gt;&gt; hill in the afternoon, Manish told me we probably had a rina there and \n&gt;&gt; might end up doing something there. When we found these yogis, we talked \n&gt;&gt; to them for a while. Just when leaving, Manish saw their havan kund where \n&gt;&gt; they do a havan everyday. Manish asked them it would be alright if we do \n&gt;&gt; Chandi homam in that havan kund that night. They welcomed us under the \n&gt;&gt; condition that we would not call any dark energies, as they were \n&gt;&gt; worshippers of Narayana. We told them we would call Mahalakshmi in fire \n&gt;&gt; and they consented. We went back later that night with all materials and \n&gt;&gt; did a Chandi homam. The place had around 10 dogs. They were barking loud \n&gt;&gt; before, but they all came and sat around the homam once fire started. \n&gt;&gt; Surprisingly, the dogs just sat around the fire without any sounds or \n&gt;&gt; barking for a whole 2 hours. It was Manish, I, that old naath panthaa \n&gt;&gt; yogi and a bunch of dogs that sat around the havan kund for 2 hours.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Until we invoked the Mother, it was very silent except for our soft \n&gt;&gt; voices. But the moment we invoked the Mother in fire, there were strange \n&gt;&gt; noises all around us on the hill and in the valley. Suddenly, so many \n&gt;&gt; birds and flies started making various noises. The effect of \n&gt;&gt; transitioning from such silence to such an animated state all around us \n&gt;&gt; was quite strange and eerie. That animated state continued for a few \n&gt;&gt; minutes. Also, when we offered bali at the end of homam, suddenly all the \n&gt;&gt; dogs got up and started running together towards the southwestern \n&gt;&gt; direction while jumping up now and then, as though they were chasing \n&gt;&gt; somebody.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There was no electricity there. The ONLY light in the vicinity was homam \n&gt;&gt; fire. There were so many mosquitos all around us and biting us \n&gt;&gt; continuously. We did not eat anything since noon and it was 10:30 pm when \n&gt;&gt; we finished. Still, it was so nice. Like I said, there is something \n&gt;&gt; ethereal about the air of Kurukshetra. Though I only spent only a couple \n&gt;&gt; of days there, I have fond memories of that place.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt;   From: manoj sharma\n&gt;&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;&gt;   Sent: Saturday, June 13, 2009 12:42 AM\n&gt;&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Pitri Tarpana Question (Re: &quot;Vishnu Sahasra \n&gt;&gt; Naama Homam&quot;..)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;         JAI MAA\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;         Narsimha ji & others\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;         Namaskar\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;         i am sharing one thing, but don&#39;t want to disturb you.\n&gt;&gt;         my native village is in Kurukshetra and there is a water pond in \n&gt;&gt; almost every village the elders told us that you can worship or meditate \n&gt;&gt; any devta or devi standing in these ponds, your spiritual progress will \n&gt;&gt; magnifying by many folds. one day a old village prist also told that when \n&gt;&gt; the fire homa is not possible due to rain (in our tradition the homa done \n&gt;&gt; in open) then you can invoke the deva in water and perform the ahuti in \n&gt;&gt; it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;         thanks\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;         --- On Sat, 13/6/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

Not so long \n&gt;&gt; ago, every Braahmana used to perform a brief pitri tarpana everyday, as a \n&gt;&gt; part of daily rituals. This is not without reason.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           The thoughts of the minds around us do have a subtle impact on \n&gt;&gt; our mind. When too many depressed, sad or frustrated people are around \n&gt;&gt; you, it will have a negative effect on you. Similarly, when some peaceful \n&gt;&gt; and blissful people or elevated souls are around you, it will have a \n&gt;&gt; positive effect on you. Thus, thoughts in the minds around you does have \n&gt;&gt; an impact on you.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           This is particularly true with respect to the minds of people \n&gt;&gt; who have genetic/kaarmik links/debts with you. When minds of such people \n&gt;&gt; are in great distress or great excitement, it has an impact on your mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           If a deceased ancestor to whom you have a kaarmik debt has some \n&gt;&gt; strong desires and unable to progress to a higher loka or be reborn, his \n&gt;&gt; thoughts and desires will have an impact on your mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           Thus, we invest our mental energy praying for their relief. \n&gt;&gt; While offering balls of solid food (shraaddha) on special occasions, pray \n&gt;&gt; that the ancestor may get an appropriate body again to fulfil remaining \n&gt;&gt; desires. While leaving water in pitri tarpana, pray that the ancestor&#39;s \n&gt;&gt; desires may be satisfied and the ancestor may be overcome the weaknesses. \n&gt;&gt; By praying for helping an ancestor, you are indirectly helping yourself, \n&gt;&gt; by removing a powerful negative influence on your mind and getting rid of \n&gt;&gt; some weaknesses.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           Unfortunately, the extremely simple ritual of pitri tarpana is \n&gt;&gt; out of fashion today. However, so many people will benefit tremendously \n&gt;&gt; if they do it atleast once every month if not daily. Vimalananda says \n&gt;&gt; that he will pick pitri tarpana if there is only one ritual he can \n&gt;&gt; perform.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           Not long ago, every orthodox Braahmana used to perform a fire \n&gt;&gt; ritual and a water ritual (tarpana) everyday. Rituals use external \n&gt;&gt; symbols to induce internal changes. These two rituals are really \n&gt;&gt; important and useful rituals.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           A small comparison of homam and tarpana is reproduced from \n&gt;&gt; vedic-wisdom yahoogroup archives:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           ------------ --------- -----\n&gt;&gt;           One word on Homam vs Tarpana. In homam, you are calling devatas \n&gt;&gt; and the medium is fire. In tarpana, you are calling pitris and the medium \n&gt;&gt; is water. Both sadhanas are applicable to all people irrespective of \n&gt;&gt; whether watery signs/planets are strong or fiery signs/planets in their \n&gt;&gt; horoscope.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           In homam, devatas come in fire and burn your blocking karmas to \n&gt;&gt; purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in water and free you from vasanas \n&gt;&gt; (conditioning of the mind) that were karmically inherited from them. If \n&gt;&gt; you have genes from (and rina with) an ancestor who was lustful or angry \n&gt;&gt; or jealous and the consciousness of the deceased ancestor is still having \n&gt;&gt; those thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoughts due to the \n&gt;&gt; connection and may even commit some bad karmas because of the weaknesses. \n&gt;&gt; You can free yourself from the rina by working on giving a rebirth to \n&gt;&gt; that ancestor. If the ancestor&#39;s consciousness is attached to a new body, \n&gt;&gt; the thoughts and cravings of that consciousness will not affect your \n&gt;&gt; consciousness in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a strong \n&gt;&gt; source of bad karmas, while homam burns off previously committed bad \n&gt;&gt; karmas. Both are very important sadhanas for spiritual progress.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           Devatas are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their \n&gt;&gt; self-identification is to what is known as soul and represented by Sun. \n&gt;&gt; They work on your individual soul and free it from the karmas it carries. \n&gt;&gt; Pitris are grosser forms of consciousness with strong attachments and \n&gt;&gt; desires. Their self-identification is with what is known as mind and \n&gt;&gt; represented by Moon. You may note that Sun and Moon are associated with \n&gt;&gt; Devas and Pitris in the hora chart of astrology. Fire and water are the \n&gt;&gt; natural media for them respectively.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           Devas and pitris have different ways of working and influencing \n&gt;&gt; us and helping our spiritual progress. But both are relevant to all of us \n&gt;&gt; and have a role to play in our spiritual evolution. Worshipping devas in \n&gt;&gt; fire and satisfying pitris in water are very important.\n&gt;&gt;           ------------ --------- -----\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           Best regards,\n&gt;&gt;           Narasimha\n&gt;&gt;           ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------  \n&gt;&gt; ---------\n&gt;&gt;           Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \n&gt;&gt; homam\n&gt;&gt;           Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \n&gt;&gt; tarpana\n&gt;&gt;           Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;&gt;           Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. \n&gt;&gt; net\n&gt;&gt;           Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst \n&gt;&gt; rologer.org\n&gt;&gt;           Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan \n&gt;&gt; nath.org\n&gt;&gt;           ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------  \n&gt;&gt; --------- \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           --- In JyotishGroup@ yahoogroups. com, Ramakrishnan \n&gt;&gt; Krishnamurthy &lt;ramki108@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;           &gt;\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;&gt;           &gt;\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; Thanks for this valuable manual. Could you enlighten me on \n&gt;&gt; the difference between Pitri Tarpana and Shraddham? I believe Shraddham \n&gt;&gt; is performed once a year on the thithi of demise of one&#39;s father (to be \n&gt;&gt; performed by the eldest son). There are some variants such as performing \n&gt;&gt; it during the Shraddha Paksham instead of on the actual thithi, every \n&gt;&gt; year. Also, have heard of a Gaya Shraddham, which is to be performed once \n&gt;&gt; in a lifetime, and which makes it unnecessary to perform yearly Shraddham \n&gt;&gt; subsequently.\n&gt;&gt;           &gt;\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; Have tried to search for material on this but have not \n&gt;&gt; succeeded so far.
