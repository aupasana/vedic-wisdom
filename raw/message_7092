He personifies what it means to be a true and authentic sp=\r\niritual teacher.\n\nSri Acharyaji is a very rare spiritual teacher who combin=\r\nes deep personal insight, and an ability to awaken profound spiritual reali=\r\nzation in others, with an extensive academic background. Sri Acharyaji teac=\r\nhes the ancient philosophy of Sanatana Dharma in a way that is inviting to =\r\nthe modern mind.\n\nHe began his personal spiritual journey over 35 years ago=\r\n. He coupled his decades of intense spiritual practice and study with advan=\r\nced academic achievements, earning a Ph.D. in religious studies from the Un=\r\niversity of Wisconsin-Madison.\n\nSri Acharyaji occupies his full time teachi=\r\nng Dharma spirituality to diverse audiences. He has lectured on Dharma at d=\r\nozens of top universities, such as Harvard, Columbia, Rutgers, Cornell, and=\r\n Northwestern. He has also served as a consultant for such Fortune 500 comp=\r\nanies as Ford Motor Corporation and Lucent Technology.\n\nIn addition to lead=\r\ning satsangs, seminars and lecturing on Sanatana Dharma widely, Sri Acharya=\r\nji is a renowned author, as well as a personal spiritual guide (guru) to a =\r\nrapidly increasing following of enthusiastic students from both the Indian =\r\nand the non-Indian communities. Sri Acharyaji was the Resident Acharya (Spi=\r\nritual Preceptor) of the Hindu Temple of Nebraska (2007-2009), which\nrepres=\r\nents the first time in American history that a Hindu temple has ever made s=\r\nuch an esteemed appointment. He is the Founder-President of the Internation=\r\nal Sanatana Dharma Society, a global movement dedicated to teaching Dharma =\r\nin its most authentic form.\n\nWe are currently in the midst of organizing Sr=\r\ni Acharyaji&#39;s latest national speaking tour for the U.S., scheduled for Oct=\r\nober, 2011 - June, 2012. If you would like to arrange for Sri Acharyaji to =\r\nlead a dynamic spiritual presentation (satsang) for your Hindu temple, Yoga=\r\n center, university, company, conference, or spiritual organization, contac=\r\nt us today to schedule an event. Serious inquiries only please.\n\n\nContact:\n=\r\nMr. Arjuna David Smith\nNational Events Coordinator\ndharmanation@...\n\n=\r\n\nFor further information:\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com\nhttp://www.youtube.c=\r\nom/dharmanation\n\n\n\n\nNotable Endorsements\n\n&quot;You&#39;ve done truly phenomenal wor=\r\nk teaching the pure essence of Yoga.&quot;\n\n- Dr. Deepak Chopra\n\n\n&quot;You are an aw=\r\nakened soul. May God bless you&quot;\n\n- Dr. Ganesh D. Dixit (Department of Mathe=\r\nmatics, University of Auckland)\n\n\n&quot;Sri Acharyaji is one of the most informe=\r\nd and articulate teachers of the greater Yoga tradition in the West today. =\r\nHe is in contact with the roots of this profound tradition of Self-realizat=\r\nion going back to the mantras of ancient Vedic seers and rishis. He has a d=\r\neep understanding of the foundations of Yoga in Hindu (Sanatana) Dharma and=\r\n a special insight into Bhakti Yoga, the path of devotion.&quot;\n\n- Dr. David Fr=\r\nawley (Author of over 26 books on Yoga)\n\n\n&quot;In twenty years of attending spi=\r\nritual discourses, I have never encountered a teacher with such power of au=\r\nthority, complete authenticity and abiding humility. Acharyaji is the real =\r\nthing...a truly enlightened teacher!&quot;\n\n- Dr. Nathaniel Garber, M.D.\n\n\n&quot;Sri =\r\nAcharyaji gave an inspiring and most informative lecture. He kept the audie=\r\nnce spellbound from start to finish. I could not believe how quickly time p=\r\nassed. Acharyaji is a rare and special human being.&quot;\n\n- Betty (a participan=\r\nt in one of Sri Acharyaji&#39;s seminars.)\n\n\n&quot;Sri Acharyaji, I am astounded at =\r\nyour knowledge and realization of our Dharma. That an American would grasp =\r\nthe Divine teachings as deeply as you have is wondrous. You are truly a Mah=\r\na Jagad Guru, the\nGreat World Teacher.&quot;\n\n- Sri Swami Brahmananda Saraswati\n=\r\n\n\n&quot;I am sure that no one is able to match your outstanding, qualifications =\r\nand intimate knowledge of both Western and Hindu culture. May your efforts =\r\nin teaching Sanatana Dharma continue to bear fruit and bless us all!\n\n- Lee=\r\nla Lisa M. Patterson (Owner of Deviloka)\n\n\n&quot;Sri Acharyaji is a highly disti=\r\nnguished and erudite scholar whose\ninterpretations and opinion about variou=\r\ns facets of Hindu spirituality are refreshingly novel and convincing. He su=\r\nccessfully blends the eternal values of the old with the needs of present d=\r\nay environment.&quot;\n\n- Dr. N. Bhashyam\n\n\n\nPlease forward this important announ=\r\ncement.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
