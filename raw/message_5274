This is what the Swami had to say\n\n&quot;\nBe strong, my young friends; =\r\nthat is my advice to you. You will be nearer to Heaven through football tha=\r\nn through the study of the Gita.\n\n These are bold words; but I have to say =\r\nthem, for I love you. I know where the shoe pinches. I have gained a little=\r\n experience. You will understand the Gita better with your biceps, your mus=\r\ncles, a little stronger.You will understand the mighty strength of Krishna =\r\nwith your muscles a little stronger.\n\nThis is the great fact: Strength is l=\r\nife, weakness is death. Strength is felicity, life eternal, immortal; weakn=\r\ness is constant strain and misery: Weakness is death.\nTo succeed, you must =\r\nhave tremendous perseverance, tremendous will. `I will drink the ocean, say=\r\ns the preserving soul, `at my will mountains will crumble up.&#39; Have that so=\r\nrt of energy, that sort of will, work hard, and you reach the goal.&quot;\n\n\nRava=\r\nna ,Lord Rama , Krishna , Jaya ,Vijaya...Rama Krishna Paramahamsa, Vimalana=\r\nnda.\n\nHow can one judge them when they are not on the same level as these g=\r\nreat souls. To even understand the Gita the Swami advocated a strong mind i=\r\nn a strong body to understand the mighty strength of Lord Krishna.\n\nDoes th=\r\nis not mean we are better off doing our Sadhana instead of trying to figure=\r\n out the mysteries of the Metaphysical stories.My intention is not to say s=\r\ntories are irrelevant, my intention is only to say when one&#39;s energies are =\r\nlimited why not use them towards sadhana each second. \n\nAt the end of the d=\r\nay if one is not steeped in that level of consciousness he or she might not=\r\n experience the metaphysical story within himself and might not grasp the i=\r\nnner meaning and then the story no longer is true for them..\n\n\n\n\nRegards\nVe=\r\nmparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n\n"}}
