Is that correct? As per Manusmriti:\n   a. The teaching of =\r\nvedas can be done only by Brahmin and no one\n      else.\n   b. Women and so=\r\nme sections of society are not given rights to\n      recite, listen, read, =\r\ntranslate, comment on vedas.\n\nHowever, If I am not wrong Manusmriti does no=\r\nt talk about code of conduct in different yugas (Satya, Treta, Dwapar, Kali=\r\n). Is there any reference to this? Can you throw some light on this?\n\nOfcou=\r\nrse the best reference to description of different yugas I have found is in=\r\n &quot;Guru Charitra&quot;.\n\nregards,\n\nJagmohan\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n &quot;rohinipurang&quot; &lt;rohinipurang@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; Your=\r\n &#39;rambling&#39; was indeed very interesting and enlightening, esp abt \n&gt; the st=\r\nree sharira.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We are living in Kali yuga and Kal=\r\ni is becoming deeper. We cannot \n&gt; trust that \n&gt; &gt; every standard conventio=\r\nn is based on sound knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One of=\r\n my favorite sooktas is &quot;Devi Sooktam&quot; from Rigveda. It is \n&gt; attributed \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to Vagambhrani, a female rishi. She felt oneness with the Divine \n&gt; Moth=\r\ner in \n&gt; &gt; Her undivided supreme form (nearly nirguna form) and the riks of=\r\n \n&gt; Devi \n&gt; &gt; sooktam were revealed to her then. Those eight riks are reall=\r\ny \n&gt; fantastic.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are other riks in Rigveda that were revealed=\r\n to the world by \n&gt; female \n&gt; &gt; rishis. We use those riks in our worship, m=\r\neditation, homas and \n&gt; other \n&gt; &gt; sadhanas. Yet, should we insist that wom=\r\nen cannot recite Veda? If \n&gt; &gt; Vagambhrani is amid us again as a woman, sho=\r\nuld we stop her from \n&gt; reciting \n&gt; &gt; Devi sooktam?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jnaneshwar (or Jnanadev) was a great saint from Maharashtra =\r\nfrom \n&gt; about 800 \n&gt; &gt; years back. He was a great devotee of Krishna and wa=\r\ns a fully self-\n&gt; realized \n&gt; &gt; master at a young age. He reformed religion=\r\n and corrected some \n&gt; corrupt \n&gt; &gt; traditions. He once made a buffalo chan=\r\nt Veda.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He started to recite Veda and the head of the Brahmin coun=\r\ncil \n&gt; forbade him \n&gt; &gt; because he was not &quot;qualified&quot; to recite Veda. Jnan=\r\neshwar insisted \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; everyone had a right to recite Veda and the he=\r\nad of the council \n&gt; disagreed. \n&gt; &gt; As he started reciting Veda, the Brahm=\r\nins tried to stop him by \n&gt; closing his \n&gt; &gt; mouth. Then a buffalo standing=\r\n next to him took over and chanted \n&gt; Veda. \n&gt; &gt; Astounded by the miracle, =\r\nthe Brahmins fell at his feet. The head \n&gt; apologized \n&gt; &gt; and said, &quot;we ar=\r\ne masquerading as the keepers of Veda, but you have \n&gt; the real \n&gt; &gt; unders=\r\ntanding and mastery of Veda&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jnaneshwar taught the equality of al=\r\nl and did not distinguish \n&gt; between people \n&gt; &gt; based on caste, creed or g=\r\nender. He considered BhagavadGita as the \n&gt; essence \n&gt; &gt; of Veda and wrote =\r\na fantastic commentary on it. His commentary \n&gt; departs from \n&gt; &gt; the stand=\r\nard Dwaitic (dualistic) point of view adopted by most \n&gt; Vaishnava \n&gt; &gt; gur=\r\nus and uses a purely Adwaitic (non-dualistic) point of view. It \n&gt; is a \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; priceless and timeless masterpiece.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n One Swamiji who was at my house last month had an interesting take. \n&gt; He =\r\nsaid \n&gt; &gt; that the belief that women cannot recite Vedas is based on a \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n misinterpretation. He said that the physical body we have is called \n&gt; the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &quot;stree sareera&quot; and the inner body we have is called the &quot;purusha \n&gt; =\r\nsareera&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; He said that the physical body comes from mother and the sou=\r\nl comes \n&gt; from \n&gt; &gt; father and that is why they are called so. The soul or=\r\n inner self \n&gt; is the \n&gt; &gt; thousand-headed purusha within us (described in =\r\npurusha sooktam).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He said that Veda is supposed to be recited with=\r\n the purusha \n&gt; sareera. \n&gt; &gt; According to him, it does not mean that women=\r\n cannot read it. \n&gt; Whether men or \n&gt; &gt; women, they have to read it with th=\r\ne purusha sareera, i.e. inner \n&gt; body, and \n&gt; &gt; not just with the physical =\r\nbody. So, according to him, the standard \n&gt; &gt; convention is based on a flaw=\r\ned understanding. According to him, \n&gt; one simply \n&gt; &gt; reciting Veda with t=\r\nhe mouth without the correct internal \n&gt; understanding is \n&gt; &gt; only reading=\r\n with the &quot;stree sareera&quot; and hence not doing the right \n&gt; thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n*        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In fact, reciting Veda and chanting the verses=\r\n is one thing and \n&gt; &gt; understanding them is quite another. When we make so=\r\nund, there are \n&gt; four \n&gt; &gt; levels of it - vaikhari, madhyama, pasyanti and=\r\n para. Vibration of \n&gt; material \n&gt; &gt; belonging to the gross body (sthoola s=\r\nareera) produces vaikhari \n&gt; level of \n&gt; &gt; sound and it is heard through th=\r\ne senses belonging to the gross \n&gt; body (ears). \n&gt; &gt; But vibrations at the =\r\nlevel of subtle body (sookshma sareera) and \n&gt; vibrations \n&gt; &gt; at the level=\r\n of astral body (kaarana sareera) are also there and \n&gt; can be \n&gt; &gt; perceiv=\r\ned thorough subtle perception.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one is chanting &quot;Om Namo Narayan=\r\naya&quot; and thinking of some \n&gt; mundane \n&gt; &gt; matters, the vibrations produced =\r\nat levels above vaikhari will not \n&gt; be \n&gt; &gt; auspicious. There is so much s=\r\ntress on what we do physically and \n&gt; people \n&gt; &gt; forget that what happens =\r\nat the other layers of existence is \n&gt; equally, if not \n&gt; &gt; more, important=\r\n!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you produce the correct vibrations at all levels (not just \n&gt;=\r\n physical) \n&gt; &gt; while &quot;reciting&quot; any Vedic mantra, you can truly &quot;experienc=\r\ne&quot; the \n&gt; mantra. A \n&gt; &gt; full experience of a single Vedic mantra may be su=\r\nfficient to alter \n&gt; one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; life! The mantras of Veda are most powerful=\r\n. Unfortunately, so much \n&gt; of Vedic \n&gt; &gt; scholarship these days is only su=\r\nperficial (but it has to be \n&gt; encouraged, \n&gt; &gt; because it will keep atleas=\r\nt one level of knowledge alive).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Forget the man vs woman controver=\r\nsy. The difference between genders \n&gt; is only \n&gt; &gt; in the gross body. When =\r\nyou go to the subtle body and astral body, \n&gt; there is \n&gt; &gt; no difference a=\r\nt all. One should realize that the role of gross \n&gt; body is too \n&gt; &gt; limite=\r\nd in the correct recitation/experience of a Vedic mantra. It \n&gt; is the \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n purity of the subtle body and the lightness of the astral body that \n&gt; are=\r\n far \n&gt; &gt; more important.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To be fair =\r\nand balanced, I need to throw light on the other angle. \n&gt; Like I \n&gt; &gt; said=\r\n, Vedic mantras are too powerful. They are capable of producing \n&gt; a full \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; self-realization (actually the sole purpose of Veda is &quot;to know \n&gt; self=\r\n&quot;). \n&gt; &gt; However, given the depth of Kali Yuga, it is difficult for it to \n=\r\n&gt; come in one \n&gt; &gt; shot. It comes in steps. When one is half way down the p=\r\nath, one \n&gt; has to be \n&gt; &gt; careful and under the vigilant guidance of a sad=\r\nguru.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When one is not fully realized and the gross body has a role=\r\n to \n&gt; play, there \n&gt; &gt; are some differences based on the gender that come =\r\ninto play.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If a lady carrying a baby in her womb has certain spiri=\r\ntual \n&gt; experiences \n&gt; &gt; (which a good Vedic chanting is capable of bringin=\r\ng), there can \n&gt; even be an \n&gt; &gt; abortion (or a great siddha being born, on=\r\n the other extreme).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is another subtle factor. Good Vedic ch=\r\nanting can bring an \n&gt; awakening \n&gt; &gt; of Kundalini (i.e. an awakening of se=\r\nlf-awareness) and an ascent of \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini (i.e. an ascent of self-aware=\r\nness). Though some people \n&gt; may have a \n&gt; &gt; wrong impression about Kundali=\r\nni because of the corrupt practices \n&gt; of a \n&gt; &gt; section of so-called &quot;Kund=\r\nalini sadhakas&quot;, the fact is that \n&gt; Kundalini merely \n&gt; &gt; represents one&#39;s=\r\n ego-consciousness. When one casually associates \n&gt; the body \n&gt; &gt; one sees =\r\nwith &quot;self&quot;, Kundalini is asleep in the Mooladhara chakra. \n&gt; As one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n self-awareness becomes more and more refined, Kundalini ascends in \n&gt; the =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; sookshma sareera. As one has a perfect self-realization, Kundalini \n&gt; =\r\nreaches \n&gt; &gt; Sahasrara. Whether one thinks in these terms or not, Kundalini=\r\n \n&gt; moves based \n&gt; &gt; on how evolved one is. Whether one is into Bhakti yoga=\r\n or Raja yoga \n&gt; or Karma \n&gt; &gt; yoga or Jnana yoga does not matter. All path=\r\ns lead to an awareness \n&gt; of a more \n&gt; &gt; and more correct concept of self a=\r\ns time progresses and a full \n&gt; &gt; self-realization finally. Accordingly, Ku=\r\nndalini rises more and \n&gt; more and \n&gt; &gt; reaches Sahasrara at the end.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; During the period when Kundalini is stuck in Swadhishthana chakra, \n&gt; s=\r\nexual \n&gt; &gt; drive can multiply. Several yogis get stuck in this stage and fa=\r\nil \n&gt; the tests \n&gt; &gt; to progress further. In general, women have a higher d=\r\nrive than \n&gt; men. If that \n&gt; &gt; drive multiplies, there can be a difficult s=\r\nituation. However, it \n&gt; really \n&gt; &gt; depends on the individual and we canno=\r\nt generalize.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thus, there are some practical difficulties on the w=\r\nay, which may \n&gt; have made \n&gt; &gt; some people come up with some rules. Howeve=\r\nr, are those issues \n&gt; sufficient to \n&gt; &gt; ban women from reciting Veda? I d=\r\non&#39;t think so. In fact, the \n&gt; factors I wrote \n&gt; &gt; above are probably irre=\r\nlevant given the superficial understanding \n&gt; of Veda \n&gt; &gt; present at this =\r\ntime and the superficial recitation of Veda that we \n&gt; find \n&gt; &gt; these days=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But, if you want to be sure and do not want to misguide anyone, =\r\nit \n&gt; is better \n&gt; &gt; to not give any advice. Leave it to one&#39;s sadguru. If =\r\nyou have a \n&gt; sadguru who \n&gt; &gt; is guiding your spiritual sadhana, surrender=\r\n and do as your guru \n&gt; says! What \n&gt; &gt; is good for goose may not be good f=\r\nor gander. What goose&#39;s guru \n&gt; taught to \n&gt; &gt; goose may be good only for g=\r\noose and not for gander. Gander will do \n&gt; well to \n&gt; &gt; follow gander&#39;s gur=\r\nu.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think I rambled enough for today... :-)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\n&gt; &gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jaganna=\r\nth Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Mess=\r\nage ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;rohinipurang&quot; &lt;rohinipurang@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, February 24, 2007 12:18 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] reading/learning the veda\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;A warm namaste to =\r\neveryone!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have heard it said that women are not allowed to \n&gt;=\r\n read/know/recite the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vedas.
