The mind and the e=\r\ngo are one and\nthe same. The others, [i.e. the other two antahkaranas or in=\r\nner organs] the\nintellect and chittam [the storehouse of tendencies] are on=\r\nly this. Mind\n[manas], intellect [buddhi], the storehouse of tendencies [ch=\r\nittam] and ego\n[ahankara]; all these are only the one mind itself. This is =\r\nlike different\nnames [such as son, husband, father, clerk, Hindu, etc.] bei=\r\nng given to a\nman according to his different functions. The individual soul=\r\n is nothing but\nthis mind or ego=E2=80=A6\n\nThe =E2=80=98I-thought=E2=80=99 =\r\nwhich rises in this manner appears in the form of the three\ngunas, and of t=\r\nhese three, the rajas and tamas aspects cling to and identify\nwith the body=\r\n. The remaining one which is pure sattva is alone the natural\ncharacteristi=\r\nc of the mind, and this stands clinging to the reality.\nHowever, in this pu=\r\nre sattvic state, the =E2=80=98I-thought=E2=80=99 is no longer really a\ntho=\r\nught, it is the Heart itself.\n\n&#39;The wise understand the apparent meaning of=\r\n prajnana [consciousness] to be\nthe mind, and its true meaning to be the He=\r\nart. The Supreme is not other\nthan the Heart. &#39; (Sri Ramana Gita, V. 18)\n\nS=\r\nri Bhagavan is saying that when the mind is active, that is, dominated by\nr=\r\najas and tamas, identification with the body takes place, but when the mind=\r\n\nis quiet and still, that is, in its pure sattvic state, it subsides into t=\r\nhe\nHeart until only the Heart remains. Sri Bhagavan has stated in the\nquota=\r\ntions from Maharshi=E2=80=99s Gospel and Self Enquiry that were given earli=\r\ner\nin this article that the mind is nothing other than the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=\r\n=99-thought.\n\nWhen this =E2=80=98I-thought identifies itself with objects, =\r\nthe rajasic and tamasic\nmind arises, but when the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-thoug=\r\nht alone remains, it can be termed the\nsattvic mind. However, Sri Bhagavan =\r\nstates in this section that the term\n=E2=80=98sattvic mind=E2=80=99 is some=\r\nthing of a misnomer, for when only the feeling of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99\nremai=\r\nns, the mind has ceased to exist.\n\nSri Bhagavan often stated that the bigge=\r\nst obstacle to Self-realisation is\nthe =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99 idea=\r\n. Since he states here that a mind dominated by\nrajas and tamas identifies =\r\nwith and clings to the body, a rajasic or a\ntamasic mind is obviously an un=\r\nproductive vehicle for sadhana. According to\nSri Bhagavan, realisation is o=\r\nnly attained by abiding in the sattvic state.\nHowever, since the mind has c=\r\neased to exist in this state, one cannot say\nthat abidance in this state is=\r\n abidance in the mind; rather, it is abidance\nin the state where the mind i=\r\ns absent.\n\nWhen the mind, the distinctive knowledge that rises from the non=\r\n-distinctive\nstate of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, clings to and identifies with th=\r\ne Self, it is called true\nknowledge. It may also be called =E2=80=98knowled=\r\nge which is the movement of the\nmind in the form of the Self=E2=80=99 or =\r\n=E2=80=98knowledge in an unbroken form=E2=80=99. The state\nin which this pu=\r\nre sattvic mind shines clinging to the Self is called\n=E2=80=98aham-sphuran=\r\na=E2=80=99.\n\nIn this passage Sri Bhagavan is describing the state where the=\r\n =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 feeling\nalone remains and clings to the Self. This sta=\r\nte is not the final state of\nrealisation, for in this state there is still =\r\nthe dualistic feeling that\nthere is an =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 that is clinging=\r\n to the Self.Bhagavan calls this state the\n=E2=80=98aham-sphurana=E2=80=99 =\r\nand it may be described as the subjective experience of the\nfeeling of =E2=\r\n=80=98I=E2=80=99 that manifests when the mind is quiet and still.\n\nThis sph=\r\nurana cannot remain independently apart from the reality, but it is\nthe cor=\r\nrect sign that indicates the forthcoming direct experience of that\nreality.=\r\n The source to which this sphurana clings alone is called the\nreality or pu=\r\nre consciousness. In Vedanta this is expressed by the saying\n=E2=80=98prajn=\r\nanam Brahma=E2=80=99, or pure consciousness is the absolute reality. When t=\r\nhe\npure sattvic mind abides in that sphurana and attends to its source, it =\r\nis\ncalled upasana or meditation; when one is firmly established in the stat=\r\ne\nwhich is the source of that mind, this is called jnana.\n\n&#39;During the time=\r\n of practice the natural state is called upasana\n[meditation], and when tha=\r\nt state becomes firmly and permanently established\nit is called jnana.=E2=\r\n=80=99 (Sri Ramana Gita, 1.13)\n\n=E2=80=A6Therefore, leaving the corpse-like=\r\n body as an actual corpse, and remaining\nwithout even uttering the word =E2=\r\n=80=98I=E2=80=99 by mouth, if one now keenly enquires\n=E2=80=98What is it t=\r\nhat rises as I?=E2=80=99, then in the heart a certain soundless\nsphurana, =\r\n=E2=80=98I-I=E2=80=99 [that is, an awareness which is single and undivided,=\r\n the\nthoughts which are many and divided having disappeared], alone will sh=\r\nine\nforth of its own accord.If one remains still without leaving it, even t=\r\nhe\nsphurana [having completely annihilated the sense of the individuality, =\r\nthe\nform of the ego =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99], will itself in the en=\r\nd subside, just like\nthe flame that catches the camphor. This alone is said=\r\n to be liberation by\ngreat ones and scriptures.\n\nIn the same way that a pie=\r\nce of camphor, once it has caught fire, will not\nsubside until the last tra=\r\nce of camphor is burnt, so when the aham sphurana\nis experienced it will no=\r\nt subside until the last trace of the ego is\ndestroyed. That is, when the m=\r\nind or =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99-thought turns 180 degrees away from\nthe non-Self=\r\n and turns towards the Self, it is caught in the grip of the\nSelf. After th=\r\nis, it cannot turn towards the non-Self again. This is the\nstate of sphuran=\r\na, which is the correct sign indicating that the reality is\nabout to be exp=\r\nerienced directly.\n\nBut since in this state there is still a feeling of att=\r\nending to the Self,\nthis sphurana is not actually the Self, the reality; th=\r\ne reality is the\nsource to which this sphurana attends or clings. When even=\r\n this feeling of\nattending to the Self subsides, the sphurana itself subsid=\r\nes, and only being\nremains. This state, in which even the slightest trace o=\r\nf the ego or\nindividuality has been completely annihilated, is called liber=\r\nation, the\ndirect experience of the reality, or the natural state of the Se=\r\nlf\n(sahajatma sthiti).\n\nIn Self Enquiry (Chapter 7) Sri Bhagavan says:\n\nThe=\r\n mind alone is the kundalini. It is described otherwise as a serpent only\nf=\r\nor those having a gross outlook. The six yogic centres and so on are all\non=\r\nly mental imaginations and are meant only for beginners in yoga.The same\nco=\r\nmments apply equally well to the description of the Heart as a\ndownward-fac=\r\ning lily-bud.\n\nSource:\nhttp://sri-ramana-maharshi.blogspot.com/2010/02/bhag=\r\navans-letter-to-ganapati-muni.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=\r\n=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=\r\n=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=\r\n=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00c09f8997027c7937048b8ed28e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The mind is nothing other than =\r\nthe =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.
