All you really need is the young\n&gt; man and his guru s=\r\nitting in one place and the mantra being taught. You don&#39;t\n&gt; need a big cro=\r\nwd.\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, one may say that a big crowd is needed to come and give\n=\r\n&gt; blessings, but &quot;blessings&quot; are a misunderstood and overrated concept. For=\r\n\n&gt; someone to give you blessings that do some good to you, the person shoul=\r\nd\n&gt; have something in his karmik account and the ability to transfer it to =\r\nyou.\n&gt; Most of the times, blessings given by people in our society are a me=\r\nre\n&gt; formality and mean nothing, like checks that have &quot;void - this is not =\r\na real\n&gt; check&quot; printed on them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Instead of hundred people with various=\r\n levels of interest in the goings on\n&gt; visiting the function out of social =\r\ncompulsion and watching possibly with\n&gt; boredom, an ideal setup for an upan=\r\nayanam is just the sishya and guru and\n&gt; some sadhakas related to them who =\r\nhave done sadhana and wish the young man\n&gt; well.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; If you ask m=\r\ne, the most important thing is this. The person who is\n&gt; transmitting the G=\r\nayatri mantra (usually father) should intensify his\n&gt; spiritual sadhana, es=\r\npecially with Gayatri mantra, in the months before\n&gt; upanayanam. If possibl=\r\ne, keep brahmacharya for a few months and chant\n&gt; Gayatri mantra for an hou=\r\nr or two everyday. During that time, he should\n&gt; never say Gayatri mantra o=\r\nut loud.\n&gt;\n&gt; When he transmits the mantra, he should ensure that only the y=\r\noung man\n&gt; hears it and nobody else does (i.e. no dilution in the transmitt=\r\ned energy).\n&gt; The custom is to say it in the ear while a cloth covers both,=\r\n but that only\n&gt; *symbolizes* secretiveness and may not really *ensure* sec=\r\nretiveness. If\n&gt; everybody (especially the priest) is sitting close to them=\r\n, they may also\n&gt; hear it in spite of a the cloth covering them.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I=\r\n did upanayanam to my son, we did the rituals in open air in our back\n&gt; yar=\r\nd. At the time of brahmopadesa muhurta, I took my son inside the pooja\n&gt; ro=\r\nom where I did my sadhana. I did not allow anybody, including the priests,\n=\r\n&gt; to come there. I taught the mantra to my son in an low, but audible, voic=\r\ne.\n&gt; I repeated a few times, made him repeat it a few times, ensured his\n&gt; =\r\npronunciation was correct, and then both of us did a maalaa (108 times\n&gt; me=\r\nditation) with it silently. We then came back to the backyard and the\n&gt; rit=\r\nuals continued.\n&gt;\n&gt; One more thing on muhurta: If you got a muhurta from an=\r\n astrologer you\n&gt; trust and want to follow it, please ensure that Gayatri m=\r\nantra is taught at\n&gt; that muhurta. THAT is the main event. Some priests put=\r\n a paste made of cumin\n&gt; seeds and jaggery on the young man&#39;s head at the m=\r\nuhurta time. That is\n&gt; irrelevant and brahmopadesa is the main thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; *=\r\n * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Though we did a detailed ritual for my son&#39;s upanayanam, my own up=\r\nanayanam\n&gt; was a very simple affair. Though my father is an orthodox braahm=\r\nana\n&gt; following a very simple and austere lifestyle, he is unorthodox in th=\r\ne\n&gt; matter of rituals. Above all, he fearlessly follows his convictions and=\r\n does\n&gt; not engage in rituals that he does not consider meaningful. He is a=\r\nlso\n&gt; against following the letter of the rules and breaking the spirit. Fo=\r\nr\n&gt; example, when he went to a griha pravesh (housewarming) ceremony once, =\r\nthey\n&gt; were beating a cow to force it to climb stairs to enter the room. Pe=\r\nople\n&gt; bring a cow into the room at the time of housewarming, as they consi=\r\nder a\n&gt; cow to symbolize Lakshmi and some steps in the ritual require a cow=\r\n in the\n&gt; room. As the cow was not happy to climb stairs, they resorted to =\r\nviolence to\n&gt; force it. My father was sad to see the suffering of the cow a=\r\nnd told them\n&gt; bluntly that they were doing adharma and there was no point =\r\nin getting a cow\n&gt; in the room like that. But my father puts more value on =\r\nthe spirit of the\n&gt; rules rather than the letter and does not hesitate to s=\r\npeak his mind in\n&gt; front of anybody.\n&gt;\n&gt; For my upanayanam, he took me to L=\r\nord Venkateswara temple in\n&gt; Tirupati/Tirumala, which is his favorite templ=\r\ne. At the time of muhurta, we\n&gt; were on the hill near the temple. He spent =\r\na few hours doing his japam with\n&gt; various stotras and I also did japam wit=\r\nh several stotras. When the muhurta\n&gt; came, he simply taught me Gayatri man=\r\ntra and that was it. No rituals of any\n&gt; kind were performed, except for ja=\r\npam for a few hours.\n&gt;\n&gt; In my opinion, such a simple approach is also perf=\r\nectly fine. The key\n&gt; points are that the person giving mantra should have =\r\ndone some sadhana, both\n&gt; of them should be in a good and relaxed mood at t=\r\nhe time and environment\n&gt; should be peaceful, and, the person receiving man=\r\ntra should do a lot of\n&gt; sadhana with it later on.\n&gt;\n&gt; If a businessman ope=\r\nns an account in his son&#39;s name for a new business\n&gt; venture by the young m=\r\nan, what matters is how much money father gave and how\n&gt; well the son used =\r\nthe money, how he ran the new business and how he grew the\n&gt; money. How big=\r\n a party was held, how many people came and what activities\n&gt; they engaged =\r\nin is irrelevant in the long run.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; My purpose is not to discou=\r\nrage elaborate rituals. Do them if there is\n&gt; social pressure to do so or y=\r\nou find them interesting. But, atleast ensure\n&gt; that mantropadesa happens p=\r\neacefully and correctly. More importantly, ensure\n&gt; that the young man does=\r\n some sadhana with Gayatri mantra everyday, after\n&gt; upanayanam.\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, i=\r\nt is perfectly acceptable (and beneficial) to initiate the young\n&gt; person i=\r\nnto homam after upanayanam is done. On the same day or a few days\n&gt; later, =\r\none can teach a simple version of Ganapathi homam and let the young\n&gt; perso=\r\nn perform it by oneself during weekends or so. One can start off with\n&gt; the=\r\n super-short procedure and slowly add things. Doing Gayatri mantra\n&gt; everyd=\r\nay and homam now and then will accelerate the spiritual evolution of\n&gt; the =\r\nyoung person.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons=\r\n, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and P=\r\nitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.=\r\norg/&gt;\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://sara=\r\nswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ---- Sunitha &lt;suni=\r\ntha_macherla@... &lt;sunitha_macherla%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaska=\r\nram Narasimha garu, Can the homam performed during upanayanam be\n&gt; done usi=\r\nng only coconuts and nuts?

Doing Gayatri mantra everyday and homam now and then will acce=\r\nlerate the spiritual evolution of the young person.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;----------------------------------------------------------&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;D=\r\no It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\na href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://sar=\r\naswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Spirit=\r\nuality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D&quot;_b=\r\nlank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nJyotish writings: =\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;=\r\n&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;---------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---- Sunitha &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;ma=\r\nilto:sunitha_macherla%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;sunitha_macherla@yahoo=\r\n.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaskaram Narasimha garu, Can the homam perf=\r\normed during upanayanam be done using only coconuts and nuts?
