You are correct that &quot;we are no longer \ntalking about physical energy (sound), we are talking of non-material mental \nenergy - the mental equivalent of sound in the mind&quot;.\n\nMind is the connection between what you called external universe and what \nyou called the deeper non-material universe. Mind has access to ALL realms \nof experience, but it normally focuses on the physical/material realm. \nThough mind can theretically be focused on ANY realm of experience through \neffort, it is not easy.\n\nLet me give a small analogy.\n\nIf Brahman is like the ocean bed, supreme cosmic being (who thinks all that \nall of us think, who desires all that all of us desire, who knows all that \nall of us know, and who does all that all of us do) is like the bottommost \nlayer of ocean. Various deities are like intermediate layers. Various \nobjects of the external material world that are perceived by our senses are \nlike the ripples on the surface of the ocean. Objects on the surface \nperceive other objects on the surface around them. One&#39;s body and the senses \nattached to it are an object on the surface in the analogy. When one&#39;s mind \nidentifies &quot;self&quot; with that body and its senses, it perceives objects as \nperceived by those senses. When one successfully detaches mind from that \nself-identity and identifies with another object in the ocean in a different \nlayer, one may perceive a different reality. An example was in yesterday&#39;s \nmail on mystical experiences.\n\nJust as the ocean is vast and deep and has infinite objects at infinite \ndepths, this universe has infinite possible self-identities. As one&#39;s \nself-awareness is focused on a specific object, one has specific \nexperience/perception of self and &quot;others&quot;. When self-awareness changes to a \ndifferent object, one has a different experience/perception of self and \n&quot;others&quot;. However, this is theoretical discussion for most people, as they \ncannot imagine self-awareness changing. The self-awareness of most people is \nfocused on their body with its senses and their experience/perception of \nself is the body and &quot;others&quot; is various objects as perceived through the \nsenses attached to that body. But, it IS possible for one&#39;s self-awareness \nto go from an object on the ocean surface in the analogy to a layer in the \nmdidle of the ocean or even a bottommost layer.\n\nRepetition of a mantra is only a tool for calming down the mental activity \nthat keeps feeding this self-awareness. Mind is identifying with a physical \nobject made with gross matter (body). By keeping it busy with a particular \nrepetitive activity, you have a chance of cutting off its identification \nwith that object. As an analogy, suppose a kid saw a rope right next to him \nand thought it was a snake and was scared. You may tell him no, but still \nthe thought &quot;snake is next to me&quot; will keep scaring him. If you keep him \nbusy with an activity that he immerses in, the thought of snake next to him \nmay vanish from his mind slowly.\n\nOnce the identification of mind with the body is cut off or weakened, mind \nwill have to identify with something else. Imagine a frog clinging to a rock \non an ocean surface. If it is afraid of slipping and holds on the rock \ntightly, its thoughts are on the rock always. If the frog stops thinking \nabout rock and becomes absorbed in some other thoughts, it may slip from the \nrock. If it starts sinking in the ocean, it will get hold of something else \non the way to the ocean bed (otherwise, it will drop all the way to the \nocean bed. Though that is not a bad thing at all, the frog is afraid of it \nand instinctively grabs something on the way!!). Like in that analogy, mind \nwill get a hold of another object (on the way to ocean bed, i.e. Brahman) \nand develop another self-awareness, i.e. a perception of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot;. \nIn the example from last night, the perception of &quot;I&quot; was not the body, but \na tiny particle in a tremendous wave of energy that reverberated with the \nsound of a beejaakshara. The perception of &quot;others&quot; was millions of \nparticles of the same wave of energy engaged in making the same sound and \naborbed in the same sound.\n\nLet me come back to what you wrote: &quot;if mantra is to have ANY enlightening \neffect, mantra must resonate in the mind itself. ... We are no longer \ntalking about physical energy (sound), we are talking of non-material mental \nenergy - the mental equivalent of sound in the mind.&quot;\n\nMind or individualized consciousness is just a window to the universe. If a \nroom has window on the east, you see what is on the east. If a room has \nwindow on the west, you see what is on the west. And so on. The sound of the \nmantra IS resonating somewhere (actually, everywhere) in the universe. A \nmind with a strong self-identification with a body is bombarded by the sense \ninputs of that body, just as a room with an open window on the south is \nfilled with cold wind blowing from the south and bombarded by the \nfloodlights installed outside on the south. You have to close that window \nand open window elsewhere to get something else. If self-identification with \nbody is weakened, the bombardment of sense inputs weakens and the window of \nmind can open to the mantra that resonates in the universe.\n\nWhen I said earlier that a vaccum should be created in the mind for the \nmantra and the deity to fill, this is what I was referring to.\n\n*        *        *\n\nDifferent objects of the universe, including human beings and deities, are \nmade up of gross/subtle matters of different gunas. Each object of the \nuniverse has different perceptions of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot;. Each object of the \nuniverse has different energies, i.e. different abilities to affect \ninteractions between &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot;.\n\nThe energy of an object is the energy that brought that object into being. \nDeities are objects with tremendous energy. But one cannot get close to a \ndeity unless one overcomes attachment to individualized ego and its \npotential energy. One needs to convert that potential energy into kinetic \nenergy that helps one break away from that ego and approach a deity.\n\nIn the long run, none of those objects is permanent. None of those energies \nis permanent. In terms of the previous ocean analogy, one may cling on to an \nobject on the way to the ocean bed temporarily, but the final goal is to not \nview any object as &quot;I&quot; and not consider any energy as &quot;mine&quot;. The final goal \nis to drop down all the way to the ocean bed and stay there, without any \nsense of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot; or &quot;energy&quot;.\n\n*        *        *\n\nPlease realize two fundamental things:\n\n(1) The energy of the mantra is experienced *after* the sadhana is fruitful \nand one overcomes ego. The mantra is an indirect tool for overcoming ego. If \none thinks that he is doing a powerful mantra and its energy will free him \nfrom ego, one is mistakened. One MUST put in conscious effort with constant \ncontemplation to weed out ego and pride to make one&#39;s sadhana fruitful. \nMantra does not replace that need. Instead, it works hands in hand with that \nand depends on that.\n\n(2) When one succeeds in overcoming ego and experiencing a mantra, one \nshould not think that &quot;I did it&quot; or &quot;I created that energy in my mind&quot;. One \ndoes not do anything (other than *undoing* what one did previously, viz \nputting together of a complex and weird self-identity called a body with so \nmany things attached to it and so many pre-conceived notions about the \nworld). The energy of the mantra IS already there and resonating everywhere. \nWhen mind experiences that energy and fills with it, it is simply *tuning* \nto something pre-existing and not really creating something or doing \nsomething. It is like a radio tuning to a different channel and one \nlistening to newer and better music or a driver driving on a different \nscenic road and viewing beautiful and better scenery.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; If all repetitive chanting were equal, mantra shastra would be\n&gt; 1/2 a page of text, not more.\n\nI never said they were equal. Perfect absorption into different mantras \nfills the mind with different kinds of enegies (associated with different \ndeities). So there is a lot of difference to chronicle. In terms of my ocean \nanalogy, the possible experiences when one is absorbed into a mantra are as \nvast as an ocean.\n\nBut, the essence is this: Mind has to be perfectlty absorbed into the mantra \nand a vacuum has to be created in the mind for the mantra and its deity to \nfill. Other factors related to the specific details in each mantra are \nsecondary. I want to de-emphasize all other things and emphasize this \nessential thing, i.e. control over ego.\n\nOne wanting to drive a car on various roads needs a detailed book giving all \nthe maps. But my point is that one should first learn driving. What makes \none an expert driver going to various places is not possession of thousand \nmaps but the basic driving skill. One not knowing driving will crash the car \neven if he possesses thousand maps. One good at driving may manage without \nmaps too. People emphasize complicated, mystified and nuanced knowledge and \nforget the basic essence.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI want to categorically state that the nuances of mantra shastra are neither \nnecessary nor sufficient for one to achieve spiritual progress. One may \nspend decades learning the nuances and yet not achieve anything.\n\nIf the basic essence is paid attention to, one can achieve despite not \nknowing the nuances. In fact, the nuances may come naturally to one who gets \nsome mastery over the essential factors.\n\nThe proof of the pudding is in eating it. Choose any mantra or beejaakshara \nand meditate on it silently everyday, for 2 hours (atleast one hour). Sit \ncomfortably with the back, neck and head erect, eyes closed and mind as calm \nas possible. Avoid all physical movement and remain as still as you can. If \nyou have an urge to move, suppress it as long as you can and keep pushing \nthe limit everyday. Try your best to focus the mind on mantra. Do this \nmeditation sitting in the same place, facing the same direction and at \naround the same time everyday. Do this for one year and see for yourself if \nit does something to you or not, despite not paying attention to the \ntechnicalities and nuances!\n\n*        *        *\n\nSome nuances are not irrelevant completely. But they are irrelevant to most \npeople. For example, people religiously mention beeja, shakti and keelaka of \nthe mantra and do detailed anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa. Those are all \nrelevant only to a person of a high level of self-awareness, which is not \nthe case with most people.\n\nLet me give an analogy. There may be some nuances related to how to lift the \nfoot up and land the foot while running, to maximize the speed. They are \nirrelevant to a small baby who cannot yet walk and only crawls. When the \nbaby learns how to walk and later how to run, those details will most likely \ncome to him naturally. Evem without them, one will run fine, perhaps a \nlittle\nslower. Thus, there is no point in trying to learn the nuances of running \nwhen one is still crawling. In fact, unneeded focus on those nuances of \nrunning may even make one&#39;s learning of walking very slow - it is a \ndistraction!\n\n*        *        *\n\nI answered whatever questions I could answer and felt like answering.\n\nWhat we need today is not people who can discuss theory in detail and have \nan intellectual understanding of things. In fact, these things are beyond \nintellectual comprehension. Practical sadhana is far more important. Do not \nwait till you get technicalities correct. Just start sadhana as I mentioned \nearlier and commit 1-2 hours of your time everyday and see what happens.\n\nWhat sanatana dharma and Vedic wisdom need today is a handful of sadhakas \nwho *experience* mantras at the highest level and yet remain free from pride \nand ego and become purified instruments of the Mother to carry out Her will \nwith actions of far-reaching consequences without a trace of ego in those \nactions. This is possible not by learning technicalities and nuances, but by \ndeveloping devotion, surrender and conscious effort with constant \ncontemplation.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, January 16, 2009 1:49 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Curious about the real meaning of Bijaksharas:\nStill not satisfied\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n&gt; Thank you very much for your reply. I am still not satisfied with\n&gt; the answer though, especially since I am sure I can get a lot more\n&gt; out of you :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; See, the explanation that &quot;repetitive chanting calms/anchors the\n&gt; mind&quot; is only a &quot;placebo&quot; of an answer. It does not do any justice\n&gt; to the obviously highly nuanced mantra shastra. If all repetitive\n&gt; chanting were equal, mantra shastra would be 1/2 a page of text, not\n&gt; more. So this explanation does nothing more than appease the\n&gt; atheistic scientific mind, one that is unwilling to consider (let\n&gt; alone accept) the non-material part of the universe.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am looking for a deeper answer that addresses the above concerns.\n&gt; Please bear with me in reading the following paragraph in its\n&gt; entirety before replying - I know I am not presenting new\n&gt; information to you, but merely presenting things as I know them, so\n&gt; you may reply/correct my thinking as appropriate:  More\n&gt; specifically, when I read Vivekacudamani, I am led to believe that\n&gt; the manifested universe is all and only the quintuplicated tattwas.\n&gt; The gross human being is no different (i.e. is also quintuplicated\n&gt; tattwas), but his consciousness is the link to a deeper non-material\n&gt; universe. In that deeper universe, which is the source of the\n&gt; material universe, there is the subtle body, which has, among other\n&gt; things, the antahakarana, which has the\n&gt; reflecting/considering/theorizing mind that we are all so familiar\n&gt; with. It experiences the quintuplicated universe, yet is directly\n&gt; part of the unquintuplicated universe! At an even deeper level, even\n&gt; this subtle body is a manifestation of the causal body - mahat,\n&gt; which consists of the three gunas. The manifesting/enlivening agent,\n&gt; so to speak, is the non-dual Brahman, or pure undifferentiated\n&gt; consciousness.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, in the above scheme of things, how do mantra and diety figure?\n&gt; Spoken/chanted/heard mantra is nothing more than an &quot;energic&quot;\n&gt; activity of the most external part of the universe i.e. the\n&gt; quintuplicated tattwa universe. Clearly this energic activity by\n&gt; itself, *if* limited to the quintuplicated universe, is useless. So,\n&gt; clearly, we must accept that if mantra is to have ANY enlightening\n&gt; effect, mantra must resonate in the mind itself, which is part of\n&gt; the antahakarana. Right? Now, since mind itself is NON-material,\n&gt; what does resonate mean at the mind level? We are no longer talking\n&gt; about physical energy (sound), we are talking of non-material mental\n&gt; energy - the mental equivalent of sound in the mind.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is this non-material mental energy that I wish to understand when\n&gt; I ask about mantras and beejaksharas. What is this energy? Is it\n&gt; tattwa, prana, chitta, ahamkara, manas, karma, what? Why do specific\n&gt; harmonics of it correspond to specific dieties? What exactly *is* a\n&gt; diety in terms of the above terminology? What is the cause-effect\n&gt; relationship between harmonics of this energy and the disintegration\n&gt; of the subtle and causal bodies.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope you appreciate the direction/thrust of my querying..\n&gt;\n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot;\n&gt; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; This is quite relevant and not at all inappropriate. Let me give\n&gt; the crux of\n&gt;&gt; the philosophy.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The mind is like a monkey. It wanders from one place to another\n&gt; very rapidly\n&gt;&gt; and gives varied emotions such as pride, shame, anger, sadness\n&gt; etc. When the\n&gt;&gt; mind becomes nearly calm, steady and stable, one can experience\n&gt; the bliss of\n&gt;&gt; finding the true Self. The goal of all spiritual sadhana - japam,\n&gt; homam,\n&gt;&gt; dhyanam, contemplation and various rituals - is to enable the mind\n&gt; to become\n&gt;&gt; calm.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; At first, one cannot make the mind stable and calm. All one can do\n&gt; it to tie\n&gt;&gt; the monkey (mind) to a fixed pole (mantra). The monkey still moves\n&gt; around,\n&gt;&gt; but its motion is restricted. Once it goes far, the thread tying\n&gt; it to the\n&gt;&gt; pole stops it from going further away. Similarly, when one tries\n&gt; to focus on\n&gt;&gt; a mantra and one&#39;s mind wanders to other things, one constantly\n&gt; brings it\n&gt;&gt; back to the mantra and thus one&#39;s mind tries to stay on the mantra.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thus, mantra is an anchor for the mind to focus on when it tries\n&gt; to become\n&gt;&gt; calm and stable.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; After trying enough, just as monkey tied to a pole may stop\n&gt; jumping around\n&gt;&gt; and fall asleep holding on to the pole, the mind may stop thinking\n&gt; of so\n&gt;&gt; many things and become absolutely calm and stable while repeating\n&gt; a mantra.\n&gt;&gt; When all the thoughts cease and some level of silence comes to the\n&gt; mind, one\n&gt;&gt; experiences some level of bliss.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thus, mantra is a combination of sounds that is repeated by the\n&gt; mind to aid\n&gt;&gt; mind to stop wandering from one thing to another thing. The goal\n&gt; is to give\n&gt;&gt; an anchor for the mind to focus on, instead of jumping everywhere.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Various sound combinations can be used for this purpose. For\n&gt; example, one\n&gt;&gt; can even repeat &quot;I want to find true Self&quot; constantly. Every\n&gt; combination of\n&gt;&gt; sounds is capable of making the mind calm after repeating it\n&gt; enough. Sound\n&gt;&gt; patterns making sense in various languages were used by some\n&gt; saints and\n&gt;&gt; messiahs from time to time in the past to obtain bliss and those\n&gt; sound\n&gt;&gt; patterns are revered as being sacred in various religions.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Compared to long sequence of sounds, short sound patterns are\n&gt; easier to\n&gt;&gt; focus the mind on. If you repeat a mantra with 32 or 24\n&gt; letters/syllables, a\n&gt;&gt; part of the mind is responsible for changing from one letter to\n&gt; another and\n&gt;&gt; there is more mind activity even in a state of high mental focus\n&gt; on the\n&gt;&gt; mantra. If you repeat a single syllable constantly, the task is\n&gt; simpler for\n&gt;&gt; the mind and it is easier for the mind to shut down various tasks\n&gt; of the\n&gt;&gt; mind and become close to being still and silent.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Various syllables can be used for this purpose. These syllables\n&gt; are called\n&gt;&gt; beeja aksharas.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Beeja means a seed. Beeja  akshara means a seed syllable.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When mind has absolutely no activity and becomes completely still\n&gt; (i.e.\n&gt;&gt; ceases to exist!), one realizes the true Self (Aatman or Brahman).\n&gt; When mind\n&gt;&gt; has very little activity and becomes nearly still (i.e. still\n&gt; exists, but in\n&gt;&gt; a very high state of focus and calmness), one realizes different\n&gt; pure\n&gt;&gt; manifestations of cosmic being.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When one meditates on a beeja akshara and attains the above state\n&gt; of high\n&gt;&gt; mental focus and calmness, one&#39;s mind has no thoughts other than\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; repetition of the syllable. Each syllable acts as a seed\n&gt; corresponding to a\n&gt;&gt; deity. The energy of that deity fills one&#39;s consciousness when\n&gt; one&#39;s mind is\n&gt;&gt; filled with that syllable and has no other thoughts in it. In\n&gt; other words,\n&gt;&gt; each deity is a personifications of the state of a mind that is\n&gt; focused on\n&gt;&gt; the sound of a specific beeja with no other thoughts in it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Of course, if one&#39;s mind has many thoughts while repeating a beeja\n&gt; akshara\n&gt;&gt; (or any mantra in general), one may experience a lot of emotions\n&gt; and things.\n&gt;&gt; But, when one&#39;s mind becomes nearly still and calm with no thought\n&gt; in it\n&gt;&gt; (other than what is needed for repeating that sound), we can say\n&gt; that one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; individual ego has been replaced with that of a deity and the\n&gt; deity has\n&gt;&gt; filled one&#39;s mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thus, focused meditation on a beeja akshara can make one\n&gt; experience the\n&gt;&gt; energy of a deity.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Which syllables make one experience which energy was well-\n&gt; understood and\n&gt;&gt; catalogued by ancient Hindu sages nicely.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Many mantras other than beeja aksharas were also experiemented by\n&gt; rishis,\n&gt;&gt; who understood the nature of energy experienced by one&#39;s mind when\n&gt; one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; mind is completely filled with the sound of the mantra and all\n&gt; other\n&gt;&gt; thoughts leave the mind.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So we need not experiment newly. We can use the knowledge\n&gt; discovered by\n&gt;&gt; rishis and go further.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear all,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; This is my first time posting on the vedic-wisdom group. Hope the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; topic is not inappropriate.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I was wondering if someone could tell me or point me to articles\n&gt;&gt; &gt; which explain to some depth what a Bijakshara is, what are the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Bijaksharas and why they are said to be powerful.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Specifically, I also want to know - why do only some\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sounds/syllables qualify as Bijaksharas? Also, what exactly is\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; difference between a mantra and bijaksharas? Are all bijaksharas\n&gt;&gt; &gt; automatically mantras? Do mantras consist only of bijaksharas?\n&gt; What\n&gt;&gt; &gt; effects do bijaksharas have that mantras dont have and vice\n&gt; versa?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As you can see, I want a detailed explanation.. Any and all\n&gt; details\n&gt;&gt; &gt; will be highly appreciated..\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sundeep\n\n\n"}}
