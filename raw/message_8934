In the very =\r\nsame way each specialized form of diety himself has his own characteristics=\r\n and temperament (from benovelent to playful to xxxxx ). This holds true fo=\r\nr ganapati also.\n\nIt might be far far more better to stick to Mahaganapati =\r\nand do a homam to him with his simple mantra for HIS pleasure (not urs), an=\r\nd AFTER homam (before saying goodby) ask for his grace, love, his help to s=\r\nolve whatever ur problems.\n\nIts my experience that complicated mantra with =\r\nspecific purpose tend to be &quot;driven by&quot; and &quot;invoke&quot; a specific want in our=\r\n greedy nature, rather than having love, surrender and joy for diety. \n\nreg=\r\nards...\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao  wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; There are two versions in the Ganapathi mantra compendi=\r\num I refer to:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) OM shrIM gaM saumyAya gaNapataye varavarada sarvaja=\r\nnaM me \n&gt; vashamAnaya svAhA\n&gt; \n&gt; I think Ajit has already given the same.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; (2) OM namo lakShmIgaNeshAya mahyaM putraM prayachCha svAhA\n&gt; \n&gt; This v=\r\nersion is used specifically for begetting children. Recommended \n&gt; procedur=\r\ne is to keep some butter in front, chant this mantra and then \n&gt; for the la=\r\ndy wanting a child to eat it (after bath at the end of her \n&gt; menstrual per=\r\niod).\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) In addition, there is a mantra for Lakshmi sitting on the la=\r\np of \n&gt; Ganapathi (gaNeshAMka nivAsinI mahAlakShmI mantra). This mantra can=\r\n also \n&gt; be offered to Lakshmi as a part of a Ganapathi homam:\n&gt; \n&gt; OM shrI=\r\nM hrIM klIM glauM gaM OM namo bhagavati mahAlakShmi varade shrIM \n&gt; vibhUty=\r\nai svAhA\n&gt; \n&gt; This is specifically used for prosperity. Mahalakshmi on the =\r\nlap of \n&gt; Ganesha symbolizes tremendous prosperity that comes with stabilit=\r\ny that \n&gt; is accompanied by childlike innocence and unwavering focus.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n(4) There is another Ganapathi mantra with Lakshmi beeja occurring \n&gt; sever=\r\nal times. It is known as Sampadganapathi mantra. It is also \n&gt; recommended =\r\nfor prosperity:\n&gt; \n&gt; OM shrIM glauM hrIM OM shrIM hrIM klIM glauM gaM shrIM=\r\n glauM hrIM \n&gt; gaNapate vara-varada shrIM glauM hrIM sarva-janaM me vashamA=\r\nnaya \n&gt; sampadaM dehi svAhA\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; A few other Ganap=\r\nathi mantras that can be useful to some people here. If \n&gt; you like any of =\r\nthem, you may offer them to Ganapathi in fire in your \n&gt; Ganapathi (or some=\r\n other) homam. If mantra has no &quot;svAhA&quot; at the end, \n&gt; add it to make an of=\r\nfering in fire. If it already has a svAhA at the \n&gt; end, offer it as is and=\r\n there is no need to add another svAhA.\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) Buddhi Ganapathi mantra (f=\r\nor intellectual sharpness and good \n&gt; speech): OM aiM gaM vAggaNapataye nam=\r\naH\n&gt; (2) Guru Ganapathi mantra (to bring one&#39;s guru): OM gaM gaNapataye \n&gt; =\r\nsarva-vighna-harAya sarvAya sarva-gurave lambodarAya hrIM gaM namaH\n&gt; (3) S=\r\noura Ganapathi mantra (to cure diseases): OM jyoM saH saH jyoM \n&gt; ghR^iNiss=\r\nUrya Aditya OM OM shrIM hrIM klIM glauM gaM gaNapate \n&gt; vara-varada jyOM sa=\r\nH sarva-rogAn hara hara saH jyOM svAhA\n&gt; (4) Nilakantha Ganapathi mantra (t=\r\no remove poisons from body): OM proM \n&gt; OM shrIM hrIM klIM glauM gaM nrIM g=\r\naNapate vara-varada ThaH sarva viShaM \n&gt; me nAshaya svAhA\n&gt; (5) Vidya Ganap=\r\nathi mantra (for good learning): aiM blUM OM shrIM hrIM \n&gt; klIM glauM gaM a=\r\niM blUM gaNapate vara-varada aiM blUM vidyAm dehi svAhA\n&gt; (6) Sankatahara G=\r\nanapathi mantra (when one is in serious troubles): \n&gt; shrIM OM gaNapataye n=\r\namo varavarada me \n&gt; pratibandha-R^iNa-dAridrya-roga-saMkaTAn nivAraya svAh=\r\nA\n&gt; (7) Rina Hara Ganapthi mantra (for relief from debts): OM gaNesha R^iNa=\r\nM \n&gt; Chindhi vareNyaM huM namaH phaT (aggressive version)\n&gt; (8) Rina Mochan=\r\na Ganapthi mantra (for relief from debts): OM glAM \n&gt; R^iNa-mochana gaNadhi=\r\npataye namaH (gentler version)\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; =\r\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; ------=\r\n--\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Jan 3, 2013 at 2:41 AM, seeking wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you ve=\r\nry much for your answer, Shree Narasimha.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the internet I found more=\r\n than 1 &quot;Lakshmi Ganapathi&quot; mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; One is the very one I have seen in=\r\n the manual you published and that I \n&gt; am reciting regularly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you=\r\n post the link to one you would recommend?\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks again\n&gt; Ranga\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
