It is very much\n&gt; possi=\r\nble and in fact is a measure of self realized people.\n=C2=A0\nIndeed, one ca=\r\nn carve one&#39;s own niche by combining multiple paths. They are not meant to =\r\nbe mutually exclusive.\n=C2=A0\nI&#39;ll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book &quot;R=\r\naja Yoga&quot; where he makes a comment on the 4 paths:\n=C2=A0\n&quot;Each soul is pot=\r\nentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity within by controllin=\r\ng\n nature: external and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psyc=\r\nhic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free=\r\n.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nHere are my 2 cents.\n=C2=A0\nJnana yoga emphasizes on philosophiza=\r\ntion and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga em=\r\nphasizes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devoti=\r\non and surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and tr=\r\ny to develop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control a=\r\nnd surrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qua=\r\nlities develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Final=\r\nly, a realized person (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or oneness) will have all these q=\r\nualities fully blossomed.\n=C2=A0\nForget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa,=\r\n nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Raja =\r\nyoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised\n against it. Controlling=\r\n body and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend requ=\r\nires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, w=\r\nater and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga=\r\n can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitl=\r\ny taught in &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one of the greatest spiritual texts IM=\r\nHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taug=\r\nht it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nJnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into th=\r\ne delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/hone=\r\nst/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that &quot;all is Brahman. I am Bra=\r\nhman. Whatever I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s all a delusion anywa=\r\ny&quot; without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces duality=\r\n in consciousness every instant. Kind\n of like declaring wisely in a movie =\r\nthat &quot;it&#39;s just a movie and not reality&quot;, but flinching in every scary scen=\r\ne, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely and e=\r\narnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of constant cont=\r\nemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional jump to =\r\nthe end.\n=C2=A0\nIMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yo=\r\nga are the most suitable and safest.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------=\r\n-\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n-----=\r\n---\n=C2=A0\n--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, Vishnu Jandhyala &lt;jvishnu@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Ms. Maja,\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; Now different type of 4 yogas ba=\r\nsed on ayana/kendra:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dharma ayana - Gyana yoga- lagna and its trine=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; Artha ayana - Karma yoga -\n 10th bhava and its trines\n&gt; &gt; Kama ayana =\r\n- Raja yoga- 7th bhava and its trines\n&gt; &gt; Moksha ayana - Bhakti yoga - 4th =\r\nbhava and its trines\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagavat Gita, you=\r\n can check it, I assure\n&gt; &gt; there are four of them.

It is very much&lt;br&gt;&gt; possible and in fact is a measure o=\r\nf self realized people.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, one can carve one&#39;s own niche =\r\nby combining multiple paths. They are not meant to be mutually exclusive.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; where he=\r\n makes a comment on the 4 paths:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Each soul is potentially div=\r\nine. The goal is to manifest this divinity\n within by controlling\n nature: =\r\nexternal and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control=\r\n, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;Here are my 2 cents.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophiz=\r\nation and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga e=\r\nmphasizes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devot=\r\nion and surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and t=\r\nry to develop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control =\r\nand surrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qu=\r\nalities develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Fina=\r\nlly, a realized person (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or oneness) will have all these =\r\nqualities fully blossomed.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vi=\r\nmsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend agains=\r\nt Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised\n against it. Cont=\r\nrolling body and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and asce=\r\nnd requires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted=\r\n air, water and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Ra=\r\nja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna ex=\r\nplicitly taught in &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one of the greatest spiritual t=\r\nexts IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. =\r\nHe taught it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of fa=\r\nlling into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not=\r\n sincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that &quot;all is Brah=\r\nman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s all a d=\r\nelusion anyway&quot; without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinf=\r\norces duality in consciousness every instant. Kind\n of like declaring wisel=\r\ny in a movie that &quot;it&#39;s just a movie and not reality&quot;, but flinching in eve=\r\nry scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, si=\r\nncerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of =\r\nconstant contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusi=\r\nonal jump to the end.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakt=\r\ni yoga and Karma yoga are the most suitable and safest.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best r=\r\negards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources:=\r\n &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.o=\r\nrg/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;--- In so=\r\nhamsa@yahoogroups.com, Vishnu Jandhyala &lt;jvishnu@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; Dear Ms. Maja,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Now differ=\r\nent type of 4 yogas based on ayana/kendra:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Dharma=\r\n ayana - Gyana yoga- lagna and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt; Artha ayana - Karma=\r\n yoga -\n 10th bhava and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Kama ayana - Raja yoga- 7th=\r\n bhava and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Moksha ayana - Bhakti yoga - 4th bhava a=\r\nnd its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagava=\r\nt Gita, you can check it, I assure&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; there are four of them.
