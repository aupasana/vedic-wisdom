I also see ego in his Senior Guru Mahar=\r\naj for cursing the ailing sadhu to lifetime of illness for not being given =\r\naudience and I see ego in them in much the same way you and other people se=\r\ne ego in Ravana. Ravana was a tapasvi of a very high caliber. Yet people bu=\r\nrn his effigy on dussera. How many times do we see his actions identified w=\r\nith his deity? We call Ravana fare and square a demon. Robert Svoboda puts =\r\nup a very positive image of Vimalananda so we see only positive in him. Rav=\r\nana is put in a very bad light by some scriptures and we see only bad in hi=\r\nm, yet he was a very\n powerful sadhaka than Vimalanada or his senior guru m=\r\naharaja for sure. So why cannot we see Ravana&#39;s action as divine play and s=\r\ntop Ravana dahan on dussera? And if we see Ravana as egoisitic, then for su=\r\nre why the incidents I mention from Vimalanada&#39;s book cannot be seen in a s=\r\nimilar way. But htese are all great sadhak and were greatly successful in w=\r\nhatever they tried to achieve from their sadhana.\n=C2=A0\nI am not very well=\r\n versed with scriptures so I find it hard to quote from them or remember al=\r\nl the names, but do you remember a rishi from the Mahabharata who was plead=\r\ned to Duryodhana to pay a visit pandavas in the forest. This rishi was very=\r\n pleased by the hospitality shown by Duryodhana. But this rishi was well kn=\r\nown for his temper and often feared by people. It is exactly for this reaso=\r\nn why Duryodhana invited this rishi to his palace and provided him with all=\r\n hospitality so that he could convince this rishi to pay visit to panadavas=\r\n who would not be able to accomodate the rishi this lavishly and therefore =\r\nwould have to suffer his curse.If this rishi was so temperamental, how was =\r\nhe so succesful in his sadhana? I read so frequently=C2=A0about the need to=\r\n give up anger for success in sadhana.=C2=A0This apparently does not seem=\r\n=C2=A0to apply to=C2=A0this rishi. He was successful regardless. Vimalanada=\r\n&#39;s book also mentions that this rishi was later punished by Lord\n Visnu and=\r\n had 10,000 years of his tapasya fruits taken away from him. If everything =\r\nthat these rishi&#39;s do has to be identified with their deity and therefore c=\r\nannot be faulted, why did Lord Visnu have to punish him?\n=C2=A0\nI am not sa=\r\nying that I should not change my svabhau to achieve success in sadhana. It =\r\nis never nice to be too temperamental of egositic, but it is certainly not =\r\neasy to change once nature either. we can only hope that chnage in svabhau =\r\ncan be brought about by our sadhana, but if we are not going to be successf=\r\nul in a our irrespective of our effort becuase of our svabhau, and if we do=\r\n not have the strength to change ourselves, basically based on what you are=\r\n saying we will not progress. That is depressing. I am not trying to start =\r\nan argument here, but I simply do not get it. I see ego in all the poeple o=\r\nf the stories I mentioned and all of them are about great sadhaks.\n=C2=A0\nL=\r\nastly that link to the=C2=A0post=C2=A0regarding Manish is very interesting.=\r\n You did not send this to me before. You did make a mention though about Vi=\r\nmalanada Aghora series of books, and in the same message, you mentioned som=\r\neone who was able to achieve specifioc results from specific sadhana&#39;s by r=\r\neading this book. That is what drew my attention to that book and finally m=\r\nade me join this yahoo group as a way to get in touch with you. It could be=\r\n that your message had gone to the SPAM folder.You are very fortunate to ha=\r\nve met him and=C2=A0have his guidance.\n=C2=A0\nWhile I am on this subject of=\r\n success in sadhana, I do the Super Short version of the homa on a=C2=A0wee=\r\nkly basis. As I read and try to learn the regular version, I see that it ma=\r\nkes use of darbha grass in various places. Just like you in Boston, we have=\r\n a similar climate here in Toronto. How do you get grass let alone darbha d=\r\nuring the 4-6 months of freezing temperature? Do you grow them in a pot? If=\r\n so, what variety of lawn seeds you buy to grow darbha? You also mention th=\r\nat one should not be looking for specific results from once sadhana. Before=\r\n the commencement of the sadhana or homa, what should one declare as the mo=\r\ntive in such a case? I have to tell you here that I cannot lie about my int=\r\nentions to God. And=C2=A0if I do, I will probably keep thinking about it fo=\r\nr the duration of the sadhana and the whole experience gioes to waste as th=\r\ne mind is not at ease.=C2=A0=C2=A0How about when one is not clear about the=\r\n specific reasons for doing homa or sadhana but you\n were doing it for a sp=\r\necific purpose but now with purpose met, you are directionless but realise =\r\nthe significance of sadhana or homa, feel good doing it=C2=A0and do not wan=\r\nt to give up?

For example, one may do it to =\r\nlook good or impress others. Similarly, hurting someone is not necessarily =\r\ntaamasik/raajasik, when it is a result of a light ego. For example, Maharsh=\r\ni Bhrigu hitting Vishnu in the chest with his foot was a divine drama for a=\r\n higher purpose.\n\nCopying the actions of divine beings requires some intell=\r\nigence. To borrow an idiom from my mother tongue, a fox does not become a t=\r\niger if it paints stripes on its body.\n\nPeople you are talking about are ve=\r\nry high level beings. Those who efface their ego and start to self-identify=\r\n with some higher deities will start to exhibit the nature of those deities=\r\n. Their actions may be fierce at times, but their purpose will be divine.\n\n=\r\nWhether one wants liberation or one wants saayujya (togetherness) or yoga (=\r\noneness) of a deity or whatever one wants, the first step is to efface ego.=\r\n All sadhanas are meant for that only. If you want to achieve what Vimalana=\r\nnda or someone else achieved, the starting point is to efface your ego thro=\r\nugh sadhana. As you make progress, at some stage, you may start seeing some=\r\n results.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; Nobody here I\n&gt; thinks expects to acheive liberation re=\r\npeating a few rounds of rosary for a\n&gt; particular mantra....but certianly w=\r\nhat is required such that our sadhana\n&gt; produces results that are easily no=\r\nticeable to us.\n\nUnfortunately, it is difficult to achieve noticeable resul=\r\nts if one is thinking of it. A cricketer telling himself &quot;I must score a ce=\r\nntury today&quot; is unlikely to score a century. The best strategy is to take i=\r\nt a ball at a time and focus. Similarly, best strategy in sadhana is to sto=\r\np thinking about results and just focusing on the &quot;here and now&quot;.\n\nMoreover=\r\n, liberation is not ruled out even in this age. Ramakrishna said that he wo=\r\nuld come back a century later and that people would be liberated en masse i=\r\nn that birth. Even in these times, it is possible to be liberated.\n\n* * *\n\n=\r\nBhupendra ji, here is a mail I sent before you joined this list. Manish con=\r\nsiders himself a spiritual son of Vimalananda and has a similar nature. I a=\r\nm privately aware of some incidents similar to what you described below wit=\r\nh Vimalananda. However, the essence of Manish&#39;s mesage is to do sadhana and=\r\n efface ego, i.e. what I wrote above.\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom/message/3481\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lesson=\r\ns, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Ho=\r\nmam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nFilms that make a dif=\r\nference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWri=\r\ntings\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n---- Bhup=\r\nendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste Atul Ji,\n&gt;\n&gt; Vimalana=\r\nnda certainly seems like a cool person when we read about him but to say\n&gt; =\r\nthat sometimes he was irritated when he felt that his student did not learn=\r\n well\n&gt; is an understatement. Do you recall an instance from his book when =\r\nhe goes to a\n&gt; cave to perform a sadhana and finds somewhere else there? Af=\r\nter a brief\n&gt; argument, when the other sadhu would not budge,=C2=A0he dies!=\r\n Similarly when Robert\n&gt; Svoboda does not acknowledge Vimalnanda during a T=\r\nV interview, Vimalananda goes\n&gt; mad inspite of Robert trying to explain his=\r\n reasons for not acknowledging him.\n&gt; Vimalanada did not like to draw atten=\r\ntion to himself and secondly he was\n&gt; sick,=C2=A0and that was the reason wh=\r\ny Robert did not acknowledge any help he had\n&gt; received from Vimalananda - =\r\nto avoid people crowding at his door, but\n&gt; Vimalananda could not be pacifi=\r\ned and had the TV transmission disabled at the\n&gt; time the interview was goi=\r\nng to be aired. Why was Vimalananda seeking\n&gt; acknowledgement even when he =\r\nclaims he does not like public attention! Probably\n&gt; transmission breaking =\r\ndown was again part of divine will you think? Robert\n&gt; Sbvoboda himself men=\r\ntions in the opening chapter that dealing with Vimalananda\n&gt; was impossible=\r\n especially when one knows he is wrong but will never admit to his\n&gt; mistak=\r\ne.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then there was the story of his Senior Guru Maharaj has was denied a=\r\nudience by a\n&gt; sick sadhu. The senior guru maharaj is so insulted by this, =\r\nhe curses this ill\n&gt; sadhu with lifetime of that sickness and that sadhu fi=\r\nnally succumbs to that and\n&gt; dies! Now if I like to meet somebody and am de=\r\nnied audience, do I curse them to\n&gt; death?\n&gt;\n&gt; The examples I give above do=\r\nes not illustrate a picture of people who were\n&gt; compassionate and always w=\r\nilling to forgive and forget. But still, they were\n&gt; hugely successful in t=\r\nheir sadhana in their own way. And that is what we are\n&gt; talking about here=\r\n....the pre-requisite to success in sadhana. Nobody here I\n&gt; thinks expects=\r\n to acheive liberation repeating a few rounds of rosary for a\n&gt; particular =\r\nmantra....but certianly what is required such that our sadhana\n&gt; produces r=\r\nesults that are easily noticeable to us. I am getting a feeling though\n&gt; th=\r\nat there is really no prerequisite or nobody really knows those\n&gt; pre-requi=\r\nsites.

That is depressing. I am not tr=\r\nying to start an argument here, but I simply do not get it. I see ego in al=\r\nl the poeple of the stories I mentioned and all of them are about great sad=\r\nhaks.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Lastly that link to the&nbsp;post&nbsp;r=\r\negarding Manish is very interesting. You did not send this to me before. Yo=\r\nu did make a mention though about Vimalanada Aghora series of books, and in=\r\n the same message, you mentioned someone who was able to achieve specifioc =\r\nresults from specific sadhana&#39;s by reading this book. That is what drew my =\r\nattention to that book and finally made me join this yahoo group as a way t=\r\no get in touch with you. It could be that your message had gone to the SPAM=\r\n folder.You are very fortunate to have met him and&nbsp;have his guidance.&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While I am on this subject of success in sadha=\r\nna, I do the Super Short version of the homa on a&nbsp;weekly basis. As I r=\r\nead and try to learn the regular version, I see that it makes use of darbha=\r\n grass in various places. Just like you in Boston, we have a similar climat=\r\ne here in Toronto. How do you get grass let alone darbha during the 4-6 mon=\r\nths of freezing temperature? Do you grow them in a pot? If so, what variety=\r\n of lawn seeds you buy to grow darbha? You also mention that one should not=\r\n be looking for specific results from once sadhana. Before the commencement=\r\n of the sadhana or homa, what should one declare as the motive in such a ca=\r\nse? I have to tell you here that I cannot lie about my intentions to God. A=\r\nnd&nbsp;if I do, I will probably keep thinking about it for the duration of=\r\n the sadhana and the whole experience gioes to waste as the mind is not at =\r\nease.&nbsp;&nbsp;How about when one is not clear about the specific reasons=\r\n for doing homa\n or sadhana but you were doing it for a specific purpose bu=\r\nt now with purpose met, you are directionless but realise the significance =\r\nof sadhana or homa, feel good doing it&nbsp;and do not want to give up? Is =\r\nit important to declare a motive before commencing sadhana?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Bhupendra.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FA=\r\nMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new y=\r\nork, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DTahoma&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=\r\n=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Narasimha PVR R=\r\nao &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPA=\r\nN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;=\r\n&gt;Cc:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Thu, November 18, 2010 2:52:06=\r\n PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [vedic-wisd=\r\nom] Re: On Ego (Re: Success with Mantras)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;=\r\n \n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1879308233ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Sir,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let me add my =\r\n2 cents of perspective on your nice observations.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The examples =\r\nI give above does not illustrate a picture of people who were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; compa=\r\nssionate and always willing to forgive and forget.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Forgiving and for=\r\ngetting is not necessarily saattwik, when it is the work of a dense ego. Fo=\r\nr example, one may do it to look good or impress others. Similarly, hurting=\r\n someone is not necessarily taamasik/raajasik, when it is a result of a lig=\r\nht ego. For example, Maharshi Bhrigu hitting Vishnu in the chest with his f=\r\noot was a divine drama for a higher purpose.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Copying the actions of =\r\ndivine beings requires some intelligence. To borrow an idiom from my mother=\r\n tongue, a fox does not become a tiger if it paints stripes on its body.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;People you are talking about are very high level beings. Those who eff=\r\nace their ego and start to self-identify with some higher deities will star=\r\nt to exhibit the nature of\n those deities. Their actions may be fierce at t=\r\nimes, but their purpose will be divine.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Whether one wants liberation=\r\n or one wants saayujya (togetherness) or yoga (oneness) of a deity or whate=\r\nver one wants, the first step is to efface ego. All sadhanas are meant for =\r\nthat only. If you want to achieve what Vimalananda or someone else achieved=\r\n, the starting point is to efface your ego through sadhana. As you make pro=\r\ngress, at some stage, you may start seeing some results.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Nobody here I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thinks expects to acheive liberation repeating=\r\n a few rounds of rosary for a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; particular mantra....but certianly wh=\r\nat is required such that our sadhana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; produces results that are easi=\r\nly noticeable to us.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Unfortunately, it is difficult to achieve notic=\r\neable results if one is thinking of it. A cricketer telling himself &quot;I must=\r\n score a century today&quot; is unlikely to score a century. The best strategy i=\r\ns to take it a ball\n at a time and focus. Similarly, best strategy in sadha=\r\nna is to stop thinking about results and just focusing on the &quot;here and now=\r\n&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Moreover, liberation is not ruled out even in this age. Ramakrish=\r\nna said that he would come back a century later and that people would be li=\r\nberated en masse in that birth. Even in these times, it is possible to be l=\r\niberated.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bhupendra ji, here is a mail I sent before yo=\r\nu joined this list. Manish considers himself a spiritual son of Vimalananda=\r\n and has a similar nature. I am privately aware of some incidents similar t=\r\no what you described below with Vimalananda. However, the essence of Manish=\r\n&#39;s mesage is to do sadhana and efface ego, i.e. what I wrote above.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481&quot; rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/=\r\n3481&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best\n regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;----------------------------=\r\n------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 L=\r\nessons, Free Jyotish textbook,&lt;BR&gt;Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for =\r\nshort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org=\r\n/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fil=\r\nms that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnof=\r\nollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_b=\r\nlank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow targ=\r\net=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----------=\r\n------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- Bhupendra Jamn=\r\nadas &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Db_jamnad=\r\nas%40yahoo.ca&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:b_jamnadas=\r\n%40yahoo.ca&quot;&gt;b_jamnadas@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Atul Ji,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vimalananda certainly seems like a cool person when we read a=\r\nbout him but to say&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that sometimes he was irritated when he felt th=\r\nat his student did not learn well&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is an understatement. Do you reca=\r\nll an instance from his book when he goes to a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; cave to perform a sa=\r\ndhana and finds somewhere else there? After a brief&lt;BR&gt;&gt; argument, when =\r\nthe other sadhu would not budge,&nbsp;he dies! Similarly when Robert&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Svoboda does not acknowledge Vimalnanda during a TV interview, Vimalanand=\r\na goes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mad inspite of Robert trying to explain his reasons for not =\r\nacknowledging him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vimalanada did not like to draw attention to him=\r\nself and secondly he was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sick,&nbsp;and that was the reason why Rob=\r\nert did not acknowledge any help he had&lt;BR&gt;&gt; received from Vimalananda -=\r\n to avoid people crowding at his door,\n but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vimalananda could not b=\r\ne pacified and had the TV transmission disabled at the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; time the int=\r\nerview was going to be aired. Why was Vimalananda seeking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; acknowled=\r\ngement even when he claims he does not like public attention! Probably&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; transmission breaking down was again part of divine will you think? Rob=\r\nert&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sbvoboda himself mentions in the opening chapter that dealing w=\r\nith Vimalananda&lt;BR&gt;&gt; was impossible especially when one knows he is wron=\r\ng but will never admit to his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; mistake.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Then there w=\r\nas the story of his Senior Guru Maharaj has was denied audience by a&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; sick sadhu. The senior guru maharaj is so insulted by this, he curses thi=\r\ns ill&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadhu with lifetime of that sickness and that sadhu finally s=\r\nuccumbs to that and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dies! Now if I like to meet somebody and am den=\r\nied audience, do I curse them to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; death?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The example=\r\ns I give above does not\n illustrate a picture of people who were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; co=\r\nmpassionate and always willing to forgive and forget. But still, they were&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; hugely successful in their sadhana in their own way. And that is wh=\r\nat we are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; talking about here....the pre-requisite to success in sad=\r\nhana. Nobody here I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thinks expects to acheive liberation repeating =\r\na few rounds of rosary for a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; particular mantra....but certianly wha=\r\nt is required such that our sadhana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; produces results that are easil=\r\ny noticeable to us. I am getting a feeling though&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that there is rea=\r\nlly no prerequisite or nobody really knows those&lt;BR&gt;&gt; pre-requisites.

( or\n nadis - sorry =\r\nif i am choosing bad words) if those&lt;BR&gt;&gt; channels are not clean then th=\r\nat energy flow can create unpleasant experiences&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like increased ang=\r\ner, lust etc. and opposite if channels are clean enough.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ri=\r\nshis have clean channels and they flow along with divine will. curses and&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; blessings they give are just part of divine will. like curse given t=\r\no lord&lt;BR&gt;&gt; vishnu by sage narda which led to ramayana. similarly curses=\r\n given to yadav&lt;BR&gt;&gt; vansh and king prikshit played an important role. v=\r\nimlananda was a cool guy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; except few times when he was markedly irri=\r\ntated.Like in an incidence where one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of his female disciple tried t=\r\no illude him by coming almost naked in front of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him to learn how to=\r\n become a bhairavi. he was irritated because he felt that his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; stude=\r\nnt did not learnt well what he taught to her.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; On ot=\r\nher side people with some impurities like i-ness and\n pride may not be able=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to handle that energy well. and can experience increased anger lus=\r\nt etc. like&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ravana and sadhaka u are mentioning. Although i persona=\r\nlly believe that this is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; also part of divine will.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Please forgive me for my mistakes&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A=\r\ntul&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;=\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-1991856076-1290188589=:85611--\r\n\n"}}
