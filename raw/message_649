This person was telling me about the 64 kalas=\r\n. Not that I could understand everything that he was telling me, but let me=\r\n try and reproduce whatever I could understand.\n=C2=A0\nHe showed me an old =\r\ndiagram where there was one circle that was moving out from a centre like a=\r\n whirlpool with three concentric arms. Each arm was one layer of the 64 kal=\r\nas. Thus in total there were 64 such &quot;arts&quot; placed at various places on the=\r\n circle. At the centre was atmavidya. \nHe said these 64 represent 64 differ=\r\nent kinds of knowledge across the three realms. A man when born in this phs=\r\nyical plane, can at the maximum acquire mastery of ONLY 16 of these Kalas. =\r\nIt is impossible to master even one more Kala staying in this physical body=\r\n. And ONLY Krishna had such a mastery.That is why=C2=A0he is purna avatar.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nEven Lord Rama was not a 16 kala purna purusha. To gain mastery of o=\r\nne more then 16 would mean leaving the physical body and going into other s=\r\nubtle realms. \n=C2=A0\nFor an ordianry person, even mastery (by mastery I me=\r\nan perfected knowledge) of even a few (3/4) of these Kala is an exceptional=\r\n feat. Such a man is regarded as unique, genius, beyond words.\n=C2=A0\nNow t=\r\nhis 16/64 is theoritically=C2=A0the maximum knowledge of all aspects of=C2=\r\n=A0the universe that a man can gain from his physical body. Which is roughl=\r\ny 1/4th. \n=C2=A0\nWhile talking about this, he was also trying to explain to=\r\n me how these kalas interact with tattwas, or rather how and in what degree=\r\n should each tattwa interact with a person in his system for him to be able=\r\n to gain mastery of any particular of these 64 kalas. Then he was talking m=\r\nostlt about tattwas, and that by knowing the exact age at which a=C2=A0 rea=\r\nlly spiritual person leaves his body, it can be ascertained whether he had =\r\nuse and access to tattwas beyond the 5 gross &quot;asudha tattwas&quot; of this physi=\r\ncal plane of existence. \n=C2=A0\nAnyway I know this may all sound very jumbl=\r\ned up and incoherent, but thats entirely because of my own limitation of un=\r\nderstanding. \n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n\n\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n\n&quot;This above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - Hamlet\n\n--- On Tue, 11/11/0=\r\n8, Ramakrishna &lt;ramakrishna_blr@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Ramakrishna &lt;ramak=\r\nrishna_blr@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Power of Duality (Re: Shr=\r\ni Shri THAKUR is still alive today)\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: =\r\nTuesday, 11 November, 2008, 11:33 PM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNarasimha garu,\n=C2=A0\nNama=\r\nste.\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; When a being like Krishna is \n&gt;&gt; born with 16 kalas, He can =\r\ndo *anything* with the objects of the dual world. \n&gt;&gt; When a being like Sai=\r\n Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of \n&gt;&gt; things in the dual =\r\nworld that are impossible for others.\n\nI heard Kalas in the context of moon=\r\n (moon phases).

Even great jnaa=\r\nnis are \noccasionally deluded by Her power. One can understand unmanifested=\r\n non-dual \nBrahman, but one cannot hope to understand the dual world fully =\r\never. She is \ncapable of deluding even the greatest sadhaka with a wrong id=\r\nea as soon as \none ventures into duality. She can mislead *anyone* on *anyt=\r\nhing*. What She \ndoes and why She does that is so difficult to fathom. The =\r\nonly way to deal \nwith Her is to surrender to Her power *fully*.\n\n&gt; on the =\r\nother hand we are all a part of Divinity\n\nBTW, though we are all part of th=\r\ne same Divinity, we are all not the same. \nIn the non-dual field, we are al=\r\nl the same. But, in the field of duality, we \nhave differences due to previ=\r\nous vasanas (conditioning) , which decide what \nand how much we can do with=\r\nin the dual world. When a being like Krishna is \nborn with 16 kalas, He can=\r\n do *anything* with the objects of the dual world. \nWhen a being like Sai B=\r\naba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of \nthings in the dual world=\r\n that are impossible for others.\n\nRealizing the non-dual Self is something =\r\nthat is possible for anyone, but \nthere are limits imposed on what things o=\r\nne can do in the dual world, based \non the force of previous conditioning. =\r\nThus, all are the same at one \n(non-dual) level and all are different at an=\r\nother (dual) level.\n\nBut it is tough to know for sure what one&#39;s caliber is=\r\n. Thus, your basic \npoint holds. But I just wanted to point that all are no=\r\nt indeed the same. We \nshould be disinterested in knowing who is what, not =\r\nbecause all are the \nsame, but because we have no surefire way to know who =\r\nis what.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/=\r\n tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree J=\r\nyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC)=\r\n website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- - \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Dinesh =\r\nNambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@nambisan. net&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\nSent:=\r\n Monday, November 10, 2008 7:54 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri TH=\r\nAKUR is still alive today\n\n|| Om Lokaah Samastaah Sukhino Bhavantuh ||\n\nDoe=\r\ns it matter at all who is whose reincarnation?

There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n office and due to same Dep=C3=A2?Tt; I had friendship with some\n&gt; &gt; Teleph=\r\none\n&gt; &gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Pate=\r\nl)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C3=82 =C3=82 =\r\n=C3=82 shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always t=\r\nalking\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a w=\r\neekly\n&gt; &gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devot=\r\nional songs created\n&gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while singing. He was =\r\nreading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending =\r\nthis weekly\n&gt; &gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old.=\r\n Mr. Patel was of 30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 =\r\npm after duty hours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One d=\r\nay when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--\n&gt; &gt; =C3=A2?oRawalbhai,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me.

I was very much im=\r\npressed about\n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to =\r\ngo to Dwarka by Bus,\n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tir=\r\ne will be punctured. Yet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come f=\r\nrom Dwarka as was\n&gt; &gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super\n&gt; &gt; power\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered\n&gt; &gt; myself=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=C3=A2?Ts house before Thakur picture. I praye=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and besto=\r\nw his\n&gt; &gt; grace.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife a=\r\nt 6.10 morning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea.

This person was telling me about the 64 kalas. Not that I could=\r\n understand everything that he was telling me, but let me try and reproduce=\r\n whatever I could understand.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He showed me an =\r\nold diagram where there was one circle that was moving out from a centre li=\r\nke a whirlpool with three concentric arms. Each arm was one layer of the 64=\r\n kalas. Thus in total there were 64 such &quot;arts&quot; placed at various places on=\r\n the circle. At the centre was atmavidya. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He said these 64 repr=\r\nesent 64 different kinds of knowledge across the three realms. A man when b=\r\norn in this phsyical plane, can at the maximum acquire mastery of ONLY 16 o=\r\nf these Kalas. It is impossible to master even one more Kala staying in thi=\r\ns physical body. And ONLY Krishna had such a mastery.That is why&nbsp;he is=\r\n purna avatar.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Even Lord Rama was not a 16 kal=\r\na purna purusha. To gain mastery of one more then 16 would mean leaving the=\r\n physical body and going into other subtle realms. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;For an ordianry person, even mastery (by mastery I mean perfected kno=\r\nwledge) of even a few (3/4) of these Kala is an exceptional feat. Such a ma=\r\nn is regarded as unique, genius, beyond words.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;Now this 16/64 is theoritically&nbsp;the maximum knowledge of all aspects =\r\nof&nbsp;the universe that a man can gain from his physical body. Which is r=\r\noughly 1/4th. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While talking about this, he wa=\r\ns also trying to explain to me how these kalas interact with tattwas, or ra=\r\nther how and in what degree should each tattwa interact with a person in hi=\r\ns system for him to be able to gain mastery of any particular of these 64 k=\r\nalas. Then he was talking mostlt about tattwas, and that by knowing the exa=\r\nct age at which a&nbsp; really spiritual person leaves his body, it can be =\r\nascertained whether he had use and access to tattwas beyond the 5 gross &quot;as=\r\nudha tattwas&quot; of this physical plane of existence. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;Anyway I know this may all sound very jumbled up and incoherent, but =\r\nthats entirely because of my own limitation of understanding. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;ST=\r\nRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR:=\r\n navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&quot;This above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; -=\r\n Hamlet&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Tue, 11/=\r\n11/08, Ramakrishna &lt;I&gt;&lt;ramakrishna_blr@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(=\r\n16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: Ramakrishna &lt;ramakrishna_blr@...&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Power of Duality (Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is sti=\r\nll alive today)&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Tuesday, 11 No=\r\nvember, 2008, 11:33 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv486352971&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD =\r\nvAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Narasimha garu,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste.&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&gt;&gt; When a being like Krishna is &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&g=\r\nt; born with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of the dual wo=\r\nrld. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; When a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He =\r\ncan do a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; things in the dual world that are impossible f=\r\nor others.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I heard Kalas in the context of moon (moon phases=\r\n).

Even great jnaanis are &lt;BR&gt;o=\r\nccasionally deluded by Her power. One can understand unmanifested non-dual =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Brahman, but one cannot hope to understand the dual world fully ever. S=\r\nhe is &lt;BR&gt;capable of deluding even the greatest sadhaka with a wrong idea a=\r\ns soon as &lt;BR&gt;one ventures into duality. She can mislead *anyone* on *anyth=\r\ning*. What She &lt;BR&gt;does and why She does that is so difficult to fathom. Th=\r\ne only way to deal &lt;BR&gt;with Her is to surrender to Her power *fully*.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; on the other hand we are all a part of Divinity&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;BTW, though w=\r\ne are all part of the same Divinity, we are all not the same. &lt;BR&gt;In the no=\r\nn-dual field, we are all the same. But, in the field of duality, we &lt;BR&gt;hav=\r\ne differences due to previous vasanas\n (conditioning) , which decide what &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;and how much we can do within the dual world. When a being like Krishna =\r\nis &lt;BR&gt;born with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of the dua=\r\nl world. &lt;BR&gt;When a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can d=\r\no a lot of &lt;BR&gt;things in the dual world that are impossible for others.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Realizing the non-dual Self is something that is possible for anyone, b=\r\nut &lt;BR&gt;there are limits imposed on what things one can do in the dual world=\r\n, based &lt;BR&gt;on the force of previous conditioning. Thus, all are the same a=\r\nt one &lt;BR&gt;(non-dual) level and all are different at another (dual) level.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But it is tough to know for sure what one&#39;s caliber is. Thus, your ba=\r\nsic &lt;BR&gt;point holds. But I just wanted to point that all are not indeed the=\r\n same.

This=\r\n is an unbelievable experience that I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; have had. I have no=\r\nt added anything from my own. I am writing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n exactly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; as was happened in my life. I am going back to the period of&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; 1973/74.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly read this only when you are in rel=\r\nigious mood.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was wor=\r\nking as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dwarka.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee all=\r\nowance&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; extra duty. There was a Telephone=\r\n exchange just opposite to Post&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; office and due to same De=\r\np=C3=A2?Tt; I had friendship with some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Telephone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C3=82 =\r\n=C3=82 =C3=82 shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting =\r\nhim he was always talking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur.=\r\n We came close day by day. There was a weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; gathering\n at&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs c=\r\nreated&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while singing.=\r\n He was reading Ramkrishna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngs=\r\nters were attending this weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; meeting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on S=\r\naturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only about Thakur.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nOne day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=A2=\r\n?oRawalbhai,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife =\r\nis remembering me. My&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; son&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few=\r\n minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD. -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call =\r\nhim.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there\n =\r\nwill be a plane&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; crash&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also=\r\n happened. I was very much impressed about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus,&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire wi=\r\nll be punctured. Yet I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did no=\r\nt come from Dwarka as was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; punctured&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on the w=\r\nay. This was surprising.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me =\r\nto believe that he had some super&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; power&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and =\r\nthis was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrende=\r\nred&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; myself&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=C3=A2?Ts h=\r\nouse before Thakur picture. I prayed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n de=\r\neply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n grace.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my =\r\nwife at 6.10 morning&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was=\r\n to start from 7 am I was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; waking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 =\r\nmorning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; acc=\r\nepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; she&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oWhy should yo=\r\nu take such a hasty&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; decision?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Par=\r\namhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; was a&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru should be living one, who can guide us=\r\n,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; give&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take D=\r\nixa from Shri Ram Sharma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Acharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; since you a=\r\nre doing Gayatri Mantra=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD--.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her argum=\r\nents\n were right at her place as people in general not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; know&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I hav=\r\ne taken&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Pat=\r\nel. --&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me tha=\r\nt Thakur was telling&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before a=\r\nccepting him. I also decided to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediatel=\r\ny told my wife that =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oSee, Mr. Patel&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; has&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen him. He has never=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; asked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Pat=\r\nel is coming to our house&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; within&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 mi=\r\nnutes, would you believe that my selection for Thakur is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nperfect?=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=C3=A2?&quot;=\r\n=C3=A2?oHow it is possible? I don=C3=A2?Tt believe.=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD-&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I\n prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel imm=\r\nediately to justify my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; decision and convince my wife. =C3=\r\n=A2?~I want to test your existence&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; even&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; toda=\r\ny.=C3=A2?T&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at m=\r\ny home at 06.30 in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; morning with angry mood. What he t=\r\nold?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=A2?~ How dare you test Thakur this way? Do =\r\nyou know what happened?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night duty and I=\r\n had just come to my home at 05.30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mornings today and tri=\r\ned to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; pulled my b=\r\nlanket and told me that-=C3=A2?o Go to your friend=C3=A2?Ts&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ho=\r\nuse. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will s=\r\nhow you his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; house=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I imm=\r\nediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the way&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; your house and pushing me too. What\n you want? Why you a=\r\nre&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; disturbing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him in such an early morning f=\r\nor such a silly things?=C3=A2?T&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We both were so exci=\r\nted and surprised that we had no words that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Morning.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my =\r\nlife.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; were some more Devine experience=\r\ns about Shri Thakur but I will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; write&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it some=\r\ntime.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is =\r\nstill alive on the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; earth.
