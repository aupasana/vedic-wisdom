Shiva and Vishnu had unconditional love and devotion for each oth=\r\ner. They are not like normal human beings and their relationships, such as =\r\nlove and devotion, are not governed by petty notions of superiority and dep=\r\nendence.\n\nThe Shaivite-Vaishnavite distinctions and the biases of Kali yuga=\r\n are unfortunate. Nevertheless, I am willing to tolerate biases and closed-=\r\nmindedness. Closed-mindedness is ok as long as one is making some progress =\r\nwith one&#39;s own belief system.\n\n* * *\n\nOne climbing a mountain has to choose=\r\n one of the available paths. Whether one acknowledges that several mountain=\r\n paths lead to the mountain top or whether one believes that only the path =\r\none has chosen leads to the top, is not that important. As long as one is c=\r\nlimbing the mountain in one&#39;s chosen path, one is doing alright!\n\nAfter all=\r\n, there may be many paths around the hill. One may be unable to see paths o=\r\nn the other side of the mountain or even distant paths on the same side. If=\r\n one does not think much of those paths and focuses on climbing in one&#39;s ow=\r\nn path, that does no harm.\n\nAs one reaches the top, it gets narrower and on=\r\ne may see the other paths that seemed quite distant earlier to be quite nea=\r\nrby now. As one is very close to the top, one will see that all paths are l=\r\neading there. When one is on the top, one sees all paths to converge there.=\r\n After god-realization, one sees various paths to be valid paths to god. Of=\r\n course, different paths come with different obstacles. One path may have s=\r\nome snow. One path may be too steep. One path may be slippery. One path may=\r\n have falling rocks. One path may have fallen trees blocking it. And so on.=\r\n But, one on the top knows that people can reach there using several paths,=\r\n if they are committed to overcoming the obstacles and reaching the top.\n\nL=\r\net people follow the paths chosen by them and wish them good luck to reach =\r\nthe top in their own paths. Let them say whatever they want to say about yo=\r\nur path. It does not matter. If YOU have conviction and faith, you just wal=\r\nk your path and reach the top!\n\n* * *\n\nThe problem is that some people are =\r\ndoing no sadhana really, making no progress really and yet passing judgment=\r\ns on other paths and getting into fights. They are like people at the base =\r\nof the mountain, trying to block people from some paths and trying to enrol=\r\nl them in their path. They may fight with people and kill them too. They st=\r\nay at the base forever and never reach the top. They are a problem.\n\nBut, p=\r\neople with narrow views who do some sadhana and make progress are ok. They =\r\nare on some path and will eventually reach god. For example, so many Krishn=\r\na bhaktas who look down upon Shiva as a lower demigod may be doing their ma=\r\nntra several malas a day with a good level of devotion and they will eventu=\r\nally make progress. I know Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do not even w=\r\norship Ganesha as he is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family&quot; and worship Vishvaksena at th=\r\ne start of their poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm to anyone,=\r\n try to see all human beings as Vishnu&#39;s forms, try to serve all and keep t=\r\nheir austerities. Bottomline is that they are doing some sadhana and will e=\r\nventually make progress.\n\nLet us not worry about people who are doing some =\r\nsadhana and progressing. Any deficiencies in their understanding will be ad=\r\ndressed in due course.\n\nThe bottomline is: Keep doing enough sadhana to bur=\r\nn the conditioning and keep making progress.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software=\r\n, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals f=\r\nor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nFilms that=\r\n make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \nSpirituality: http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/JyotishWritings\n---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n\n&gt; I hardly disagree with your views but for Iskcon I have my own thought=\r\ns,no doubt on Shri Prabhupada and his mission to spread Shri Krishna&#39;s awar=\r\neness but many times(After exit of Shri Prabhupada)on numerous occasions I =\r\nfound their views very biased towards Shri Shivji and for that reason I hav=\r\ne my reservations and those views of mine are not my own views as some seni=\r\nor ex-Iskconites too share same views like me.If I am allowed to speak I ha=\r\nve seen very few shivites speaking hard stuff like them for opposite side.(=\r\nShri Hari or Shri Krishna),not even that well known astrologer Sanjay Rath =\r\nonce posted a separate procedures for Vaishnavas to do Mahamrityunjaya japa=\r\nm using Shri Veda Vyasa&#39;s name instead of Shri Vasishtha mantra(Vam Vasisht=\r\nhaya Namah) !

If you see an elephant yourself oneday, you will rea=\r\nlize then that books that seemed contradictory once are not that contradict=\r\nory after all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Srila Prabhupada was undoubtedly a great saint. To go a=\r\nbroad without even knowing anyone there at an advanced age to spread Krishn=\r\na bhakti, to roam New York streets without proper shoes or clothing in wint=\r\ner, requires tremendous surrender. Based on previous samskaras, some may no=\r\nt be attracted to his interpretations. But that does not take away anything=\r\n from them.\n&gt; \n&gt; My personal favorite is Lord Jnaneshwar&#39;s take on Bhagavad=\r\n Gita and I also like Aadi Shankara&#39;s commentary overall. However, Srila Pr=\r\nabhupada&#39;s commentary is fine too and it is perfect for people with certain=\r\n samskaras.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sophisticated and complicated Upanishadic ideas are not pa=\r\nlatable to everyone. They need to be simplified. Especially, people from mo=\r\nnotheistic belief systems and subscription based religions need simpler mod=\r\nels of divinity. So Upanishads and scriptures need to be interpreted so as =\r\nto be palatable to them. So many great saints came and interpreted scriptur=\r\nes slightly differently, because there are different groups of people with =\r\ndifferent samkaras waiting to be guided by them.\n&gt; \n&gt; My philosophy is simp=\r\nle. Read what appeals to you. Follow what you are able to. But, in the end,=\r\n reading tomes about elephant are only the starting point.

I will reply to t=\r\nhem together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 1 below on pri=\r\nests:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing rituals for one&#39;s own upliftment is one thing and =\r\ndoing it for others is another. In the former, one is cleaning up a dirty p=\r\nlace that one is forced to live in. In the latter, one is going to someone =\r\nelse&#39;s dirty place and cleaning it up. If there is some radioactive waste t=\r\nhere and one is not protected, one may be affected.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I keep =\r\nsaying, results of one&#39;s previous karmas are like fruits lying in a basket.=\r\n One takes out one fruit after another and eats them. Some may be tasty and=\r\n some may be bitter or rotten. When one does rituals and other spiritual sa=\r\ndhana, the deities throw away some bad fruits into a trash can and make one=\r\n eat good fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be some spillage as =\r\ndirty fruits are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may =\r\nbe affected by the spillage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, priests did inte=\r\nnse sadhana and generated enough purity to handle such things. Many priests=\r\n of today do not do enough penance. They are quite vulnerable as they start=\r\n messing with other people&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, many priests of=\r\n today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to a brahman=\r\na father is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become a brahmana o=\r\nneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-like. Many=\r\n brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of money or of=\r\n comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. They are=\r\n not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas on earth =\r\nright now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for others only=\r\n by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influence, mone=\r\ny and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is th=\r\nere any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, stop doing rituals for others. =\r\nOr, do enough individual penance when you are not doing rituals for others.=\r\n Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavata=\r\nm chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming the ten=\r\ndencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 2 below on astrologers:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is not=\r\n an immature comment and there is an element of truth in it. A lot of what =\r\nI said above applies here too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Every action performed with ego=\r\n (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an astrologe=\r\nr&#39;s action of giving advice to someone resulted in that person doing X inst=\r\nead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in coming ye=\r\nars, there is clearly an action here. If the astrologer has some sense of &quot;=\r\nI am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to experience the fruits of it. Some bl=\r\nessings can come and some sufferings can come too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Messing wit=\r\nh someone else&#39;s karmas is always a risky business.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What is th=\r\ne solution? Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana l=\r\nifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly b=\r\necome a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas=\r\n and vaisyas.

Shiva and Vishnu had unconditional l=\r\nove and devotion for each other. They are not like normal human beings and =\r\ntheir relationships, such as love and devotion, are not governed by petty n=\r\notions of superiority and dependence.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Shaivite-Vaishnavite disti=\r\nnctions and the biases of Kali yuga are unfortunate. Nevertheless, I am wil=\r\nling to tolerate biases and closed-mindedness. Closed-mindedness is ok as l=\r\nong as one is making some progress with one&#39;s own belief system.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* *=\r\n *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One climbing a mountain has to choose one of the available paths.=\r\n Whether one acknowledges that several mountain paths lead to the mountain =\r\ntop or whether one believes that only the path one has chosen leads to the =\r\ntop, is not that important. As long as one is climbing the mountain in\n one=\r\n&#39;s chosen path, one is doing alright!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After all, there may be many p=\r\naths around the hill. One may be unable to see paths on the other side of t=\r\nhe mountain or even distant paths on the same side. If one does not think m=\r\nuch of those paths and focuses on climbing in one&#39;s own path, that does no =\r\nharm.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As one reaches the top, it gets narrower and one may see the o=\r\nther paths that seemed quite distant earlier to be quite nearby now. As one=\r\n is very close to the top, one will see that all paths are leading there. W=\r\nhen one is on the top, one sees all paths to converge there. After god-real=\r\nization, one sees various paths to be valid paths to god. Of course, differ=\r\nent paths come with different obstacles. One path may have some snow. One p=\r\nath may be too steep. One path may be slippery. One path may have falling r=\r\nocks. One path may have fallen trees blocking it. And so on. But, one on th=\r\ne top knows that people can reach there using several paths, if\n they are c=\r\nommitted to overcoming the obstacles and reaching the top.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let peopl=\r\ne follow the paths chosen by them and wish them good luck to reach the top =\r\nin their own paths. Let them say whatever they want to say about your path.=\r\n It does not matter. If YOU have conviction and faith, you just walk your p=\r\nath and reach the top!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The problem is that some people =\r\nare doing no sadhana really, making no progress really and yet passing judg=\r\nments on other paths and getting into fights. They are like people at the b=\r\nase of the mountain, trying to block people from some paths and trying to e=\r\nnroll them in their path. They may fight with people and kill them too. The=\r\ny stay at the base forever and never reach the top. They are a problem.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;But, people with narrow views who do some sadhana and make progress are=\r\n ok. They are on some path and will eventually reach god. For example, so m=\r\nany Krishna bhaktas who look down upon Shiva as a lower\n demigod may be doi=\r\nng their mantra several malas a day with a good level of devotion and they =\r\nwill eventually make progress. I know Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do=\r\n not even worship Ganesha as he is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family&quot; and worship Vishva=\r\nksena at the start of their poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm=\r\n to anyone, try to see all human beings as Vishnu&#39;s forms, try to serve all=\r\n and keep their austerities. Bottomline is that they are doing some sadhana=\r\n and will eventually make progress.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let us not worry about people wh=\r\no are doing some sadhana and progressing. Any deficiencies in their underst=\r\nanding will be addressed in due course.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The bottomline is: Keep doin=\r\ng enough sadhana to burn the conditioning and keep making progress.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nBest regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;---------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writi=\r\nngs,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short\n Homam and Pitri Tarpana:=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_bl=\r\nank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;A =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://S=\r\naraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I hardly disagree with your views but for I=\r\nskcon I have my own thoughts,no doubt on Shri Prabhupada and his mission to=\r\n spread Shri Krishna&#39;s awareness but many times(After exit of Shri Prabhupa=\r\nda)on numerous occasions I found their views very biased towards Shri Shivj=\r\ni and for that reason I have my reservations and those views of\n mine are n=\r\not my own views as some senior ex-Iskconites too share same views like me.I=\r\nf I am allowed to speak I have seen very few shivites speaking hard stuff l=\r\nike them for opposite side.(Shri Hari or Shri Krishna),not even that well k=\r\nnown astrologer Sanjay Rath once posted a separate procedures for Vaishnava=\r\ns to do Mahamrityunjaya japam using Shri Veda Vyasa&#39;s name instead of Shri =\r\nVasishtha mantra(Vam Vasishthaya Namah) !

You may like some a=\r\nnd dislike some based on your own biases about what an elephant looks like.=\r\n If you see an elephant yourself oneday, you will realize then that books t=\r\nhat seemed contradictory once are not that contradictory after all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Srila Prabhupada was undoubtedly a great saint. To go abroad with=\r\nout even knowing anyone there at an advanced age to spread Krishna bhakti, =\r\nto roam New York streets without proper shoes or clothing in winter, requir=\r\nes tremendous surrender. Based on previous samskaras, some may not be attra=\r\ncted to his interpretations.

However, Srila\n=\r\n Prabhupada&#39;s commentary is fine too and it is perfect for people with cert=\r\nain samskaras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sophisticated and complicated Upanishadic i=\r\ndeas are not palatable to everyone. They need to be simplified. Especially,=\r\n people from monotheistic belief systems and subscription based religions n=\r\need simpler models of divinity. So Upanishads and scriptures need to be int=\r\nerpreted so as to be palatable to them. So many great saints came and inter=\r\npreted scriptures slightly differently, because there are different groups =\r\nof people with different samkaras waiting to be guided by them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; My philosophy is simple. Read what appeals to you. Follow what you ar=\r\ne able to. But, in the end, reading tomes about elephant are only the start=\r\ning point.

In the former, one is cleanin=\r\ng up a dirty place that one is forced to live in. In the latter, one is goi=\r\nng to someone else&#39;s dirty place and cleaning it up. If there is some radio=\r\nactive\n waste there and one is not protected, one may be affected.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As I keep saying, results of one&#39;s previous ka=\r\nrmas are like fruits lying in a basket. One takes out one fruit after anoth=\r\ner and eats them. Some may be tasty and some may be bitter or rotten. When =\r\none does rituals and other spiritual sadhana, the deities throw away some b=\r\nad fruits into a trash can and make one eat good fruits earlier than otherw=\r\nise. But there may be some spillage as dirty fruits are thrown away. If a p=\r\nriest is conducting the ritual, he may be affected by the spillage.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, priests did intense sadhana =\r\nand generated enough purity to handle such things. Many priests of today do=\r\n not do enough penance. They are quite vulnerable as they start messing wit=\r\nh other people&#39;s karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, man=\r\ny priests of today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born\n=\r\n to a brahmana father is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become=\r\n a brahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahma=\r\nna-like. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or o=\r\nf money or of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberat=\r\nion. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahma=\r\nnas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed fo=\r\nr others only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, in=\r\nfluence, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, stop doing rituals for others. Or, do enou=\r\ngh individual penance when you are not doing rituals for others. Moreover, =\r\ntry to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 1=\r\n1.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming the\n tendencies of=\r\n chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 2 below on=\r\n astrologers:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This is not an immature =\r\ncomment and there is an element of truth in it. A lot of what I said above =\r\napplies here too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Every action perform=\r\ned with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If a=\r\nn astrologer&#39;s action of giving advice to someone resulted in that person d=\r\noing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing Z instead of W i=\r\nn coming years, there is clearly an action here. If the astrologer has some=\r\n sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to experience the fruits of =\r\nit. Some blessings can come and some sufferings can come too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s karmas is always a risk=\r\ny business.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What\n is the solution? Wel=\r\nl, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle descri=\r\nbed in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahman=\r\na by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas. I=\r\nrrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahman=\r\na if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karmas=\r\n of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again, =\r\nto be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmanas=\r\n by conduct.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The above will become cle=\r\nar, if you look at the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on=\r\n who can be taught Jyotish!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regar=\r\nds,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, =\r\nFree Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish\n textbook,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free &quot;D=\r\no It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that m=\r\nake a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow tar=\r\nget=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: =\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow targe=\r\nt=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings=\r\n&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWriti=\r\nngs&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 1:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc313.mail.yah=\r\noo.com/mc/compose?to=3Daksha.rudra%40yahoo.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow\n target=3D_b=\r\nlank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:aksha.rudra%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;aksha.rudra@...&lt;/A&gt;&g=\r\nt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any =\r\ncurse(Shapam)?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This I am asking after seeing the ove=\r\nrall and general condition of Brahmanas specially those who do pujas for Ya=\r\njmanas and involved in Karmakanda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if this is tr=\r\nue is there any remedy for this?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the=\r\n only place where we can discuss this subject hence I am posting this query=\r\n here.Thanks a lot in advance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 2:=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc313.mai=\r\nl.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow =\r\ntarget=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (Nara=\r\nsimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training sessions and am very eager to review my own chart. =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However in numerous instanc=\r\nes in the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and close uncles that astrology =\r\ncan have a severe adverse impact on yourself (astrologer) and yrou family. =\r\nThis may sound a very immature comment, but I thought I should get your opi=\r\nnion / thoughts on this before I proceed on this journey.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would appreciate getting a honest response =\r\nso I can put this issue to rest once and for all. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Raj&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS: I am drawn to astology more from an acad=\r\nemic perspective of how it influences our life and how ignorant we are of t=\r\nhis power around us.
