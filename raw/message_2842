Pick the time in such =\r\na &gt;way that you will be able to do it at that time everyday.\n\nwhat about th=\r\ne *Same Place* requirements for some one who travels frequently?\n\nawaiting =\r\nreply.\n\nbest regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimh=\r\na PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I will answer your private qu=\r\nestions publicly, while keeping you anonymous.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1) Difficult it is. Im=\r\npossible it is not. Pick the time in such a way that you will be able to do=\r\n it at that time everyday. For example, if the time of coming back home is =\r\nnot in your hands, do it in the morning before you go to work. If you come =\r\nhome late oneday, sleep less and somehow wake up and do it at that time.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; 2) This is a difficult niyama and takes many years to get perfection. T=\r\no start with, keep physical restraint and divert the mind whenever it has t=\r\nhose thoughts.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 3) No, any prasiddha mantra can be used.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 4) Then=\r\n don&#39;t. :-) Each rule contributes in a different way to success. If one is =\r\nunable to follow some rules, one can then follow whatever rules one is able=\r\n to follow.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 5) Yes, even Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s direct disciples t=\r\nhought like that sometimes and wanted to go back and lead &quot;regular lives&quot;. =\r\nLuckily they didn&#39;t and many people are benefiting even today.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the=\r\n early stages, such thoughts are normal. Those who use their will power to =\r\npersist will persist and achieve some level of success later on. Those who =\r\ncannot (or do not) use their will power to persist end up giving up and pos=\r\ntponing it to a later day (or a later life), when the hurdles may be even g=\r\nreater.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free =\r\nJyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writin=\r\ngs: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (S=\r\nJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; --------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; I reread yours and =\r\nManish&#39;s post on and Urdhwaretas and &#39;On Remedial Measures Difference&#39;.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Please answer a few queries of mine.\n&gt; &gt; 1) Out of the points he mentioned=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Same time every day.\n&gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; Same dire=\r\nction.\n&gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or Tulsi a=\r\ns is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the mind and the =\r\nbody, not just the\n&gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a beard.\n&gt; &gt; Do not =\r\neat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are empty\n&gt; &gt; before you =\r\nstart.\n&gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do this whole procedure 3 times.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Isn&#39;t doing the sadhna &#39;Same time every day.&#39; difficult because of job =\r\nrequirements?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2)How do you have restraint on sex from the mind? i =\r\nhave tried for body but still manytimes\n&gt; &gt; these thoughts come to my mind =\r\nand with strong urge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3)If Manish has specifically mentioned Gayat=\r\nri mantra does he means it to be Gayatri mantra only.\n&gt; &gt; What if i have ch=\r\nosen some different one?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) What if growing beard is not acceptabl=\r\ne in your working environment?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5)When you are doing your pooja or =\r\nhavan etc doesn&#39;t this thought ever comes to your mind :What the hell i am =\r\ndoing?I should go and concentrate more on my career or follow my hobby.i me=\r\nan all those sort of insecurities which a common man has.Though Vimalananda=\r\n has said on this but these things still ring a bell in your mind and force=\r\n you to think Am i wasting my time or what?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; asking these questions=\r\n on groups is odd,so kindly excuse me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
