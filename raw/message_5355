A few=\r\n quick comments.\n\n(1) We are we we eat. Production of various chemicals in =\r\nour body and their \ninteractions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what=\r\n we eat has a profound \nimpact on us.\n\n(2) Much has been written on the mat=\r\nerial benefits from vegetarianism. But that \nis not all. There are spiritua=\r\nl and subtle reasons as well.\n\nEating the flesh or body parts of an animal =\r\nthat strongly identifies with the \nphysical body entails a karma. Self-iden=\r\ntification of plants with their physical \nbody is much subtler and the karm=\r\na entailed in eating plant-based foods is much \nsmaller.\n\nEspecially these =\r\ndays, very cruel methods are used for meat production by \ncorporations and =\r\nanimals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their \nsuffering go=\r\nes to the ones benefiting from their meat.\n\n(3) I heard an interview with a=\r\n scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) several \nmonths back. They conduc=\r\nted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was \nfed with meat. The =\r\nother set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several \nmonths, researchers=\r\n found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The ones \nfed with meat w=\r\nere duller.\n\nTheir theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. =\r\nGorillas fed with \nnuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards th=\r\ne development of brain. \nThough they were not sure if the same thing applie=\r\ns to human beings or not, a \nbalanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize =\r\none&#39;s intellectual development.\n\n(4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel=\r\n dull or sleepy and cannot focus well \non work that requires alertness and =\r\nskill. That is because the digestive process \nis using up a lot of energy (=\r\nalso known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much \nagni available for other =\r\nactivities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that \nhappens in the min=\r\nd. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also \nrequires agni =\r\nand that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after \na heavy=\r\n meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before \neatin=\r\ng.\n\n(5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fr=\r\nied food \nwith more oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are=\r\n consumed more \nfrequently, agni is diverted towards digestion more often a=\r\nnd there is less agni \navailable for assimilaring intellectual and spiritua=\r\nl ideas and experiences. If \none eats saattwik food that is very easy to di=\r\ngest (simple grains, simple \nlentils and simple vegetables, all softly cook=\r\ned with mild spices, and fruits), \nless agni is diverted towards digestion =\r\nand more agni is available for \nassimilaring intellectual and spiritual ide=\r\nas and experiences.\n\n(6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But hu=\r\nge stacks of dry grass may \nbe burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little b=\r\nit of internal fire may be enough \nto assimilate spiritual ideas and experi=\r\nences in a person with excellent \nvaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass)=\r\n. A lot of internal fire may be needed \nin a person with poor vaasanas and =\r\nmany obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all \ndepends on vaasanas and impuri=\r\nties in nadis and chakras.\n\nOne person may eat meat and deep fried foods, s=\r\npend a lot of agni on digesting \nthem and yet make excellent spiritual prog=\r\nress. Another person may eat saattwik \nfood, maximize the agni available fo=\r\nr spiritual transformation and yet struggle \nto progress spiritually. Howev=\r\ner, the best course of action for one is to ignore \ncounter-examples and be=\r\n a vegetarian. All other things being equal, that \nmaximizes the agni avail=\r\nable for spiritual progress.\n\n(7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have =\r\ntheir own vaasanas and their needs. \nIf an animal can survive on vegetarian=\r\n food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor \nfellow whatever he/she needs.\n\n(8) O=\r\nne should eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough \nfo=\r\nod to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material \n=\r\nworld using physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food=\r\n is \nnot good for spiritual sadhana.\n\nInstead of overeating most of the tim=\r\ne and fasting on specific days, it is \nbetter to eat limited amount always.=\r\n Regular practices are more important for \ntransformation and success, than=\r\n occasional practices.\n\n(9) By merely thinking that god is the doer of all =\r\nactions or considering food \nto be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the karm=\r\na involved. It depends on how \ndeeply ingrained that thought is and how dee=\r\nply one feels so. If one internally \nfeels 100% that god is acting through =\r\none and whatever one is doing (e.g. \neating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, t=\r\nhen one is free.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyot=\r\nish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tar=\r\npana:\nhttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/\nFilms that make a difference: http://=\r\nsaraswatifilms.org/ \nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n--------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\n\n\n\nTake away the me, so =\r\nonly You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-386348797-1291262215=:91518\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:1=\r\n2pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; FONT-SIZE: 12=\r\npt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; FONT-SIZE: 12=\r\npt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste ,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I think the part about not=\r\n&nbsp;feeding animals meat&nbsp;Narsimha garu has mentioned in a spiritual =\r\npoint.

A=\r\n few quick comments.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(1) We are we we eat. Production of various che=\r\nmicals in our body and their interactions, are controlled by what we eat. T=\r\nhus, what we eat has a profound impact on us.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(2) Much has been writ=\r\nten on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But that is not all. There=\r\n are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Eating the flesh or body =\r\nparts of an animal that strongly identifies with the physical body entails =\r\na karma. Self-identification of plants with their physical body is much sub=\r\ntler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much smaller.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Especially these days, very cruel methods are used for meat production=\r\n by corporations and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma fo=\r\nr their suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(3) I=\r\n heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio)\n severa=\r\nl months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorilla=\r\ns was fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After sev=\r\neral months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. T=\r\nhe ones fed with meat were duller.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Their theory was that digestion o=\r\nf meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with nuts and fruits may have div=\r\nerted more energy towards the development of brain. Though they were not su=\r\nre if the same thing applies to human beings or not, a balanced vegetarian =\r\ndiet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(4) After =\r\nwe eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well on wo=\r\nrk that requires alertness and skill. That is because the digestive process=\r\n is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t m=\r\nuch agni available for other activities such as digestion of intellectual i=\r\ndeas that happens in the mind. Similarly, digestion of\n spiritual ideas/exp=\r\neriences also requires agni and that cannot happen well. That is why medita=\r\ntion or homam after a heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised =\r\nto do sadhana before eating.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(5) If foods that light up a higher dig=\r\nestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food with more oil, spicy foods that st=\r\nimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more frequently, agni is diverted =\r\ntowards digestion more often and there is less agni available for assimilar=\r\ning intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. If one eats saattwik =\r\nfood that is very easy to digest (simple grains, simple lentils and simple =\r\nvegetables, all softly cooked with mild spices, and fruits), less agni is d=\r\niverted towards digestion and more agni is available for assimilaring intel=\r\nlectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(6) Even a big fire can=\r\nnot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may be burnt by just =\r\none spark! Similarly, little bit of internal\n fire may be enough to assimil=\r\nate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent vaasanas and=\r\n few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed in a pe=\r\nrson with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all dep=\r\nends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One person may=\r\n eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting them and y=\r\net make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat saattwik food,=\r\n maximize the agni available for spiritual transformation and yet struggle =\r\nto progress spiritually. However, the best course of action for one is to i=\r\ngnore counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, t=\r\nhat maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(7) Regardi=\r\nng Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs. If an=\r\n animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor fell=\r\now whatever he/she needs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(8)\n One should eat to live and not live t=\r\no eat. A yogi should consume enough food to sustain oneself so that one can=\r\n fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material world using physical body and make spi=\r\nritual progress. Eating too much food is not good for spiritual sadhana.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead of overeating most of the time and fasting on specific days, i=\r\nt is better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are more import=\r\nant for transformation and success, than occasional practices.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;(9) B=\r\ny merely thinking that god is the doer of all actions or considering food t=\r\no be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how =\r\ndeeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one intern=\r\nally feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (e=\r\n.g. eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best rega=\r\nrds,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software,\n Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;http:=\r\n//www.vedicastrologer.org/&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: http://saraswat=\r\nifilms.org/ &lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;BR&gt;-------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp {\nborder:1px solid =\r\n#d8d8d8;font-family:Arial;margin:10px 0;padding:0 10px;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp hr {\nbo=\r\nrder:1px solid #d8d8d8;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {\ncolor:#628c2a;font-size:85%;font-=\r\nweight:700;line-height:122%;margin:10px 0;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\nmargin-bottom=\r\n:10px;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\npadding:0 0;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad p {\nmargin:0;}\n\n#ygrp=\r\n-mkp .ad a {\ncolor:#0000ff;text-decoration:none;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc {\n=\r\nfont-family:Arial;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc #hd {\nmargin:10px 0px;font-weig=\r\nht:700;font-size:78%;line-height:122%;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc .ad {\nmargi=\r\nn-bottom:10px;padding:0 0;}\n\na {\ncolor:#1e66ae;}\n\n#actions {\nfont-family:Ve=\r\nrdana;font-size:11px;padding:10px 0;}\n\n#activity {\nbackground-color:#e0ecee=\r\n;float:left;font-family:Verdana;font-size:10px;padding:10px;}\n\n#activity sp=\r\nan {\nfont-weight:700;}\n\n#activity span:first-child {\ntext-transform:upperca=\r\nse;}\n\n#activity span a {\ncolor:#5085b6;text-decoration:none;}\n\n#activity sp=\r\nan span {\ncolor:#ff7900;}\n\n#activity span .underline {\ntext-decoration:unde=\r\nrline;}\n\n.attach {\nclear:both;display:table;font-family:Arial;font-size:12p=\r\nx;padding:10px 0;width:400px;}\n\n.attach div a {\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\n.at=\r\ntach img {\nborder:none;padding-right:5px;}\n\n.attach label {\ndisplay:block;m=\r\nargin-bottom:5px;}\n\n.attach label a {\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\nblockquote {\n=\r\nmargin:0 0 0 4px;}\n\n.bold {\nfont-family:Arial;font-size:13px;font-weight:70=\r\n0;}\n\n.bold a {\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\ndd.last p a {\nfont-family:Verdana;fo=\r\nnt-weight:700;}\n\ndd.last p span {\nmargin-right:10px;font-family:Verdana;fon=\r\nt-weight:700;}\n\ndd.last p span.yshortcuts {\nmargin-right:0;}\n\ndiv.attach-ta=\r\nble div div a {\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\ndiv.attach-table {\nwidth:400px;}\n\nd=\r\niv.file-title a, div.file-title a:active, div.file-title a:hover, div.file-=\r\ntitle a:visited {\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\ndiv.photo-title a, div.photo-titl=\r\ne a:active, div.photo-title a:hover, div.photo-title a:visited {\ntext-decor=\r\nation:none;}\n\ndiv#ygrp-mlmsg #ygrp-msg p a span.yshortcuts {\nfont-family:Ve=\r\nrdana;font-size:10px;font-weight:normal;}\n\n.green {\ncolor:#628c2a;}\n\n.MsoNo=\r\nrmal {\nmargin:0 0 0 0;}\n\no {\nfont-size:0;}\n\n#photos div {\nfloat:left;width:=\r\n72px;}\n\n#photos div div {\nborder:1px solid #666666;height:62px;overflow:hid=\r\nden;width:62px;}\n\n#photos div label {\ncolor:#666666;font-size:10px;overflow=\r\n:hidden;text-align:center;white-space:nowrap;width:64px;}\n\n#reco-category {=\r\n\nfont-size:77%;}\n\n#reco-desc {\nfont-size:77%;}\n\n.replbq {\nmargin:4px;}\n\n#yg=\r\nrp-actbar div a:first-child {\nmargin-right:2px;padding-right:5px;}\n\n#ygrp-m=\r\nlmsg {\nfont-size:13px;font-family:Arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;}\n\n#y=\r\ngrp-mlmsg table {\nfont-size:inherit;font:100%;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg select, input,=\r\n textarea {\nfont:99% Arial, Helvetica, clean, sans-serif;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg pre=\r\n, code {\nfont:115% monospace;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg * {\nline-height:1.22em;}\n\n#ygrp=\r\n-mlmsg #logo {\npadding-bottom:10px;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg a {\ncolor:#1E66AE;}\n\n#ygr=\r\np-msg p a {\nfont-family:Verdana;}\n\n#ygrp-msg p#attach-count span {\ncolor:#1=\r\nE66AE;font-weight:700;}\n\n#ygrp-reco #reco-head {\ncolor:#ff7900;font-weight:=\r\n700;}\n\n#ygrp-reco {\nmargin-bottom:20px;padding:0px;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov li =\r\na {\nfont-size:130%;text-decoration:none;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov li {\nfont-size=\r\n:77%;list-style-type:square;padding:6px 0;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov ul {\nmargin:=\r\n0;padding:0 0 0 8px;}\n\n#ygrp-text {\nfont-family:Georgia;}\n\n#ygrp-text p {\nm=\r\nargin:0 0 1em 0;}\n\n#ygrp-text tt {\nfont-size:120%;}\n\n#ygrp-vital ul li:last=\r\n-child {\nborder-right:none !important;}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      &lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-386348797-1291262215=:91518--\r\n\n"}}
