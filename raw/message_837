Rao \n&gt; &gt; &lt;pvr@&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;   Dear Sundee=\r\np,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is quite relevant and not at all inappropriate. Let=\r\n me \ngive \n&gt; &gt; the crux\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the philosophy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n* * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mind is like a monkey. It wanders from one place =\r\nto \nanother \n&gt; &gt; very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rapidly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and gives varied emotions suc=\r\nh as pride, shame, anger, \nsadness \n&gt; &gt; etc. When\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind =\r\nbecomes nearly calm, steady and stable, one can \nexperience \n&gt; &gt; the bliss\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; finding the true Self. The goal of all spiritual sadhana=\r\n - \n&gt; &gt; japam, homam,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dhyanam, contemplation and various rituals - =\r\nis to enable \nthe \n&gt; &gt; mind to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; become\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calm.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n At first, one cannot make the mind stable and calm. All one \ncan \n&gt; &gt; do i=\r\nt to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tie\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the monkey (mind) to a fixed pole (mantra). The mo=\r\nnkey still \n&gt; &gt; moves around,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but its motion is restricted. Once it=\r\n goes far, the thread \ntying \n&gt; &gt; it to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pole stops it from goin=\r\ng further away. Similarly, when one \ntries \n&gt; &gt; to focus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n a mantra and one&#39;s mind wanders to other things, one \nconstantly \n&gt; &gt; brin=\r\ngs it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back to the mantra and thus one&#39;s mind tries to stay on the \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, mantra is an anchor for the mind to focus=\r\n on when it \ntries \n&gt; &gt; to become\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; calm and stable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nAfter trying enough, just as monkey tied to a pole may stop \n&gt; &gt; jumping ar=\r\nound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and fall asleep holding on to the pole, the mind may stop \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n thinking of so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many things and become absolutely calm and stable w=\r\nhile \n&gt; &gt; repeating a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When all the thoughts cease a=\r\nnd some level of silence comes \nto \n&gt; &gt; the mind,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exper=\r\niences some level of bliss.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, man=\r\ntra is a combination of sounds that is repeated by \nthe \n&gt; &gt; mind to aid\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind to stop wandering from one thing to another thing. The \n=\r\ngoal \n&gt; &gt; is to give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an anchor for the mind to focus on, in=\r\nstead of jumping \n&gt; &gt; everywhere.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Various sound combination=\r\ns can be used for this purpose. For \n&gt; &gt; example, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can even repe=\r\nat &quot;I want to find true Self&quot; constantly. Every \n&gt; &gt; combination of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sounds is capable of making the mind calm after repeating it \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nenough. Sound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; patterns making sense in various languages were used =\r\nby some \n&gt; &gt; saints and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; messiahs from time to time in the past to o=\r\nbtain bliss and \nthose \n&gt; &gt; sound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; patterns are revered as being sac=\r\nred in various religions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Compared to long sequence of soun=\r\nds, short sound patterns \nare \n&gt; &gt; easier to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; focus the mind on. If =\r\nyou repeat a mantra with 32 or 24 \n&gt; &gt; letters/syllables,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n part of the mind is responsible for changing from one letter \nto \n&gt; &gt; anot=\r\nher and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is more mind activity even in a state of high=\r\n mental \nfocus \n&gt; &gt; on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra. If you repeat a single syllable =\r\nconstantly, the task \nis \n&gt; &gt; simpler for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mind and it i=\r\ns easier for the mind to shut down various \n&gt; &gt; tasks of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind a=\r\nnd become close to being still and silent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Various syllable=\r\ns can be used for this purpose. These \nsyllables \n&gt; &gt; are called\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be=\r\neja aksharas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Beeja means a seed. Bee=\r\nja akshara means a seed syllable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When mind has absolutely =\r\nno activity and becomes completely \n&gt; &gt; still (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ceases to exist=\r\n!), one realizes the true Self (Aatman or \n&gt; &gt; Brahman). When\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has very little activity and becomes nearly still (i.e. \nstill \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n exists, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a very high state of focus and calmness), o=\r\nne realizes \ndifferent \n&gt; &gt; pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manifestations of cosmic being.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one meditates on a beeja akshara and attains the above \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; state of high\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental focus and calmness, one&#39;s mind has no thou=\r\nghts other \nthan \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; repetition of the syllable. Each syllable=\r\n acts as a seed \n&gt; &gt; corresponding to a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deity. The energy o=\r\nf that deity fills one&#39;s consciousness \nwhen \n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; filled with that syllable and has no other thoughts in it. \nIn \n&gt; &gt; ot=\r\nher words,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; each deity is a personifications of the state of a mind =\r\nthat \nis \n&gt; &gt; focused on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the sound of a specific beeja with no othe=\r\nr thoughts in it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, if one&#39;s=\r\n mind has many thoughts while repeating a \n&gt; &gt; beeja akshara\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (or an=\r\ny mantra in general), one may experience a lot of \nemotions \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; things.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, when one&#39;s mind becomes nearly still and calm with n=\r\no \n&gt; &gt; thought in it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (other than what is needed for repeating that =\r\nsound), we can \nsay \n&gt; &gt; that one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individual ego has been=\r\n replaced with that of a deity and \nthe \n&gt; &gt; deity has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; filled one&#39;s=\r\n mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, focused meditation on a beeja akshara can make=\r\n one \n&gt; &gt; experience the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; energy of a deity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which syllables make one experience which energy was well-\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; understood and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; catalogued by ancient Hindu sages nicely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many mantras other than beeja aksharas were also \nexperiemented \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; by rishis,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who understood the nature of energy experienced by on=\r\ne&#39;s \nmind \n&gt; &gt; when one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind is completely filled with the sound =\r\nof the mantra and \nall \n&gt; &gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thoughts leave the mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So we need not experiment newly. We can use the knowledge \n&gt; &gt; disc=\r\novered by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rishis and go further.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ho=\r\nmam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): \nhttp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: \nhttp://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear all,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is my first=\r\n time posting on the vedic-wisdom group. \nHope \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; topic is =\r\nnot inappropriate.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was wondering if someone could tel=\r\nl me or point me to \n&gt; &gt; articles\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which explain to some depth wha=\r\nt a Bijakshara is, what are \nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bijaksharas and why they are sai=\r\nd to be powerful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Specifically, I also want to know - w=\r\nhy do only some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sounds/syllables qualify as Bijaksharas?
