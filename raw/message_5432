He met Adi Shankaracharya,\n    Guru Nana=\r\nk, Kabir and Vigyaneswar of maharastra, so many people still\n    claim to h=\r\nave been guided or blessed by Guru Gorakhnath.\n\n    Narsimha is living in u=\r\ntmost darkness and trying to become a guru of\n    darkness, neither he has =\r\ngot self knowledge or enlightenment by self\n    sadhana nor by study of sha=\r\nstras, result is, he has become a victim of\n    own trapings living within =\r\na small well of perception, so, what fits\n    into his uneducated perceptio=\r\nn, he presents that as his wisdom, this\n    is not only wrong but its fatal=\r\n also.\n\n    He is so much insecured that he warns people to not to get carr=\r\nied\n    away by Guru Gorakhnath or his path, may be, he thinks that Guru\n  =\r\n  Gorakhnath can mislead people ?
