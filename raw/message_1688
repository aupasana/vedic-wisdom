Hence a=\r\n very important question to answer..\n \nTo answer it, I will go back to the =\r\nanalogy I gave just a few days back:\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom/message/1673 (Why rituals)\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe child is taug=\r\nht by parents to say things like &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;sorry&quot; in different situa=\r\ntions. I compared it to engaging in rituals and repeating mantras without u=\r\nnderstanding. I said that the child slowly understands the true meaning wit=\r\nh experience and feels the emotions represented by those words when saying =\r\nthem. I compared it to a sadhaka experiencing spiritual truths represented =\r\nby the rituals as he gains experience and becomes more ready.\n \nNow, think =\r\nabout this. Parents speaking different languages teach different words to t=\r\nhe child. A parent speaking English may teach &quot;I am sorry&quot;. A parent speaki=\r\nng Hindi may teach &quot;mujhe maaf keejiye&quot;. Another Hindi speaking person may =\r\nteach &quot;mujhe maaf karo&quot;. A parent speaking Telugu may teach &quot;nannu kshaminc=\r\nhandi&quot;. Another Telugu speaking person may teach &quot;nannu kshaminchu&quot;. And so=\r\n on. The words are different. But they represent the same thought and emoti=\r\non.\n \nActually, at one level, the meaning is slightly different in each cas=\r\ne, depending on the peculiarities and cultural context of the language used=\r\n. For example, the English expression has &quot;I&quot; as the subject and one is tal=\r\nking about how one feels. The Hindi and Telugu expressions have the other p=\r\nerson as the subject and asking him to forgive. The amount of respect shown=\r\n is different in different expressions. Thus, the exact meaning is slightly=\r\n different. Thus, children speaking different languages may visualize somet=\r\nhing slightly different as their understanding of the languages improves. H=\r\nowever, these differences are minor. As one delves deeper, the basic emotio=\r\nns associated with these different expressions is the same in different lan=\r\nguages and one will feel those emotions with compassion as one masters the =\r\nlanguage.\n \nSimilarly, deities, rituals and mantras used in different relig=\r\nious traditions may be different, but they may represent the same divine en=\r\nergy and the same spiritual experiences. Just as the immeidate visualizatio=\r\nn of an expression in the mind of a child may change based on cultural cont=\r\next and grammar that one is exposed to, the immeidate imagination of a deit=\r\ny&#39;s gross/external form in the mind of a sadhaka may change based on the re=\r\nligious paradigms and spirutal context that one is exposed to. However, the=\r\nse differences are minor. As one delves deeper, the basic energies and expe=\r\nriences represented by various deities and rituals are the same in differen=\r\nt religious traditions and one will experience the same spiritual truths as=\r\n one masters one&#39;s path.\n \nNo wonder Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa=\r\n vadanti&quot; (Truth is One, but the learned say it differently).\n \n*        * =\r\n       *\n \nOne language may have a lot of different words for an object wit=\r\nh slight variation whereas another language may have fewer words. As an exa=\r\nmple, a language spoken near equator may have a single word for &quot;snow&quot;, &quot;ic=\r\ne&quot;, &quot;dew&quot;, &quot;mist&quot; etc, whereas English has so many words. Native language o=\r\nf Alaskans, who live in snow and ice most of the year, has many more words =\r\nthan English for slightly different kinds of snow, whereas English calls al=\r\nl of them as &quot;snow&quot;.\n \nSimilarly, religious traditions that explored slight=\r\nly different kinds of the same divine energy may have personified those ene=\r\nrgies as different deities. So some religions may have more deities than so=\r\nme other religions. Some religions may have a lot of deities for different =\r\nvariations of a similar purpose, whereas another religion may have only one=\r\n deity.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf communication can be internalized and we=\r\n can communicate with our emotions, we do not need language and we will all=\r\n be on the same page always. But we cannot communicate with our internal em=\r\notions and need an external method. So language is needed. But language can=\r\n divide.\n \nSimilarly, spiritual truths are internal (like our emotions). In=\r\n order to express them and transmit them to others, we need deities, mantra=\r\ns, rituals and religion. But religion can divide.\n \nOne child may say &quot;I am=\r\n sorry&quot; and another may say another expression meaning the same thing and t=\r\nhey may argue who is right. One may say &quot;my father said this is correct&quot; an=\r\nd another may say &quot;my mother said this is correct&quot; and they may fight on wh=\r\no is correct. People fighting over whose religion is superior and trying to=\r\n &quot;convert&quot; others are like such children. Unfortunately, my &quot;child and lang=\r\nuage&quot; analogy is too mild in this area and the fights between religions hav=\r\ne been far worse than two children arguing about their language. Countless =\r\npeople have been murdered in the name of religion.\n \nInstead of arguing whi=\r\nch expression is correct and finding fault with others, children learning s=\r\nhould focus on the true meaning of what they saying and try to understand w=\r\nhat exactly their expression means and feel the correct emotions when they =\r\nsay things. Similarly, instead of fighting with others on religion, one sho=\r\nuld try to understand one&#39;s own religion better and experience the spiritua=\r\nl truths represented in that religion.\n \n*        *        *\n \nOne may thin=\r\nk there is a Christian god, an Islamic god, a Hindu god etc and they are re=\r\nsponsible for respective religions and societies. That is not true.\n \nIf on=\r\ne believes that there is a supreme deity (whatever the name you use to desc=\r\nribe) who creates all beings, then one has to realize that Vyasa, Buddha, C=\r\nhrist, Propher Mohammed and Mahavira were sent to this earth by that same s=\r\nupreme deity and different religions came into being only because that supr=\r\neme deity willed so! Each religion serves a useful purpose at a given place=\r\n and a time. When a religion&#39;s time is up, it goes.\n \n*        *        *\n =\r\n\nSome may say that external forms of deities who personify different aspect=\r\ns of divine energy running the universe are a creation of the mind. However=\r\n, they are not a creation of the current state of mind. Mind has accumulate=\r\nd many layers of conditioning though many lives. Thus, one may not have eve=\r\nr seen or thought about or imagined a specific form of a deity in this life=\r\n, but may have a vision of that form, on account of conditioning accumulate=\r\nd through many lives. An example is the boy mentioned in the following mess=\r\nage:\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/761\n \nHe had not =\r\nread about some of the avataras of Vishnu he saw above the fire. But he saw=\r\n them and could describe them. This is because those forms represent a pers=\r\nonification of a certain energy and his mind imagined that energy in that f=\r\norm in a previous life. The memory stayed with the mind (though not conscio=\r\nusly) and it can come back anytime. So, though he did not know about that f=\r\norm, that form appeared before him.\n \nSwami Vivekananda famously said (para=\r\nphrased), &quot;a human being imagines god as a super human being with many hand=\r\ns and heads. If a buffalo imagines god, it may imagine god as a super buffa=\r\nlo with many horns&quot;. Though he is right in a sense, it is misleading too. I=\r\nt may incorrectly trivialize external forms. Though external forms are a wo=\r\nrk of the mind, that does not make them unimportant.\n \nUntil one learns how=\r\n to feel sorry and show that feeling, saying &quot;I am sorry&quot; as a ritual is an=\r\n important habit. Not teaching a child words because he cannot anyway under=\r\nstand their correct meaning is wrong. The child should be taught even if he=\r\n does not understand. He will understand the true meaning later Similarly, =\r\nthough the energy represented by a form is more basic than a specific exter=\r\nnal form associated with that energy, many people will reach that energy on=\r\nly by imagining that form and worshipping that form. So, if one&#39;s mind tend=\r\ns to imagine a form, one should imagine the form and worship that form.\n \nT=\r\nhough we say that forms of deities and mystical experiences are a creation =\r\nof mind, that is in a vedantic sense, i.e. the entire manifested universe i=\r\ns a creation of the mind (over many lives). Only Brahman is real and not cr=\r\neated by the mind. Everything else is a creation of the mind over the time.=\r\n If we say that a form of a deity or an experience is an imagination of the=\r\n mind, it does not mean it is a hallucination. Mind is connected to its fie=\r\nld of experience. Various minds in its field of experience are connected to=\r\n it. For example, the experience described in the following message was ind=\r\nependently &quot;observed&quot; by two people. Human mind can imagine things and hall=\r\nucinate, but two minds observing the same thing is different from a typical=\r\n hallucination:\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951\n \n=\r\nMost divine forms and divine experiences chronicled in sacred texts of vari=\r\nous religions have been independently experienced by multiple people.\n \n*  =\r\n      *        *\n \nWhen someone looks sad, one person may say &quot;he is sad&quot;. =\r\nAnother person may say &quot;woh dukhi hai&quot;. Another person may say &quot;vaadu baadh=\r\na padutunnaadu&quot;. Similarly, when a divine energy is present in a place, one=\r\n may perceive the energy as deity X and another may perceive it as a deity =\r\nY. Just as the expression one uses to describe the feeling one perceives is=\r\n based on the language one knows, similarly the form mentioned by one to de=\r\nscribe the enegy one perceives depends on the conditioning of one&#39;s mind an=\r\nd the religious tradition one is exposed to.\n \nI know one person who does C=\r\nhandi homam. When he finishes the homam, he calls back the Divine Mother in=\r\nto his heart by showing the fire with his hands and motioning the hands tow=\r\nards his heart (with eyes closed). When he does it, he just perceives a nic=\r\ne energy around him and feels peaceful and happy. When he was doing this on=\r\neday, a gentleman was visiting and sitting right behind him. His eyes were =\r\nclosed and he was meditating. When the above happened, he was baffled and o=\r\npened his eyes to see what was going on. He had a vision of a dark goddess =\r\nwho was jumping towards him along with a big pile of kumkum (vermillion pow=\r\nder) all around Her. He was overwhelmed by the vision and opened his eyes. =\r\nBut the person who did homam perceived only some nice energy and no specifi=\r\nc form. Thus, the same energy may be perceived by different people in a dif=\r\nferent form. One person may perceive only some energy and another may perce=\r\nive a specific form. Yet another may perceive a different form. The exact p=\r\nerception is based on the conditioning of the mind. But the energy itself i=\r\ns uniform, though the form is not.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI have covered v=\r\narious aspects related to this topic.
