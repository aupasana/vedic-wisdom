Two small comments, feel free to ignore them if =\r\nthey don&#39;t make sense.\n\n\nFirstly it is indeed true that for many traditiona=\r\nl practices a Guru is needed, however it is neither sanguine nor fail-proof=\r\n, by which I mean there are often cases where even Guru may not be able to =\r\nsave a disciple from a certain kind of experience. One of the main reasons =\r\nbeing in this point of Kali Yuga realistically speaking getting a Guru who =\r\nhas the Shakti and the Divine connect to pull a disciple off or cushion the=\r\n disciple from all experiences or prepare the disciple properly and make ex=\r\nperiences digestible is quite rare to find. Gurus are many, but Gurus who c=\r\nan really control these stuff and give the right kind of Shakti are very ve=\r\nry rare, and it does not matter whether they are in some sampradaya or outs=\r\nide of all sampradaya.=C2=A0\n\n\nIn such an environment doing ones own sadhan=\r\na without waiting for a formal Guru is not a bad idea. Regarding homas ther=\r\ne are two kinds of homas. One where it is a process to connect to God using=\r\n Agni Tattwa. When one prays in a temple to an idol one is trying to use Pr=\r\nithiwi Tattwa. Otherwise, in principle, both are similar. Of course practic=\r\nal differences exist and that is due to the difference in the nature of the=\r\n two great elements.=C2=A0\n\n\nThen there is the homa done for Kriya-s or spe=\r\ncific results. That is complex and may require guidance. But I think PVR me=\r\nntions in his manuals that he does not encourage such homas or one should i=\r\ndeally use these only for the purpose of worshiping deities.\n\n\n\nI started m=\r\ny first homa in 2007 when I did not know PVR or even this website. Infact I=\r\n come from an environment when is not particularly religious or ritualistic=\r\n and I had frankly never even seen a homa. But the year before that I had a=\r\n strange and chance encounter with a spiritual man - who refuses to be addr=\r\nessed as a Guru - and he inspired me to try out spiritualiy. I became curio=\r\nus and started sadhana with mantra japa. Then one day I felt a strong desir=\r\ne to do homas. I asked some people around me and all of them unanimously to=\r\nld me not to do so. I still did anyway. =C2=A0Since then it has been nearly=\r\n 9 years I have been doing homas to different deities. Of course in between=\r\n now and then I have come across more advaced yogis who have kidly helped m=\r\ne or directed me or told me a step here and step there, rest I just kept wa=\r\nlking. This led to some experiences too over the years. But none of these y=\r\nogis were really traditional Gurus, nor did anyone ever give\n me formal dik=\r\nsha.\n\n\nOne of the main sadhanas which I was fortunate enough to do was Chan=\r\ndi homas. I remember one day I came across a very traditional individual wh=\r\no was shocked when I told him that I do this sadhana. He insisted that it c=\r\nannot be done like this and it needs a guru and a diksha otherwise strong n=\r\negative consequences are bound to come due to the wrath of the Mother. Now =\r\nI tend to get bit aggressive when I find condescending people. So I told hi=\r\nm that I have done more than 500 Chandi homas (after which I have stopped c=\r\nounting) and not only done them inside my home but in ancient and powerful =\r\nShakti peethas, in deserted locales, in off beat places, but places fit for=\r\n Shakti sadhana, where many ordinary people would not venture easily. Now i=\r\nf he really believed what he said, that would mean that the Mother must hav=\r\ne allowed me to do these, for I did not face any wrath but only more opport=\r\nunities to intensify the sadhana. So I am assuming the big boss is OK with\n=\r\n me doing things in a non-traditional fashion. He had nothing more to say.=\r\n=C2=A0\n\n\nI am not saying or suggesting that tradition is wrong, it is there=\r\n for a purpose but getting the spirit of the rules in Tradition is far more=\r\n important than blind following of the same. Traditions exist for the Deity=\r\n, not the other way round. And given the point in time where we are, I am a=\r\nfraid there will be more and more souls who will worship and eventually int=\r\neract with Deities outside of formal traditions. For a soul who has done sa=\r\ndhana and wants to do so, will always do so, Nature and the Deity will make=\r\n it happen, irrespective of whether s/he lines up with a tradition or not, =\r\nwhether s/he is born in India or South Pole. This is the new reality.\n\n\nOn =\r\nthe other hand if the mind has doubts about consequences of going in a non-=\r\ntraditional manner, then one is better off not doing so. Because doubts mak=\r\ne the sadhana go wrong, and the mind itself will cause more obstructions th=\r\nat anyone or anything else. Mind can be our best friend in the path, or our=\r\n worst enemy.\n\n\n\n* =C2=A0 =C2=A0 * =C2=A0 =C2=A0 *\n\n\nComing to the dream th=\r\nat you saw, I would say it was a very significant dream. =C2=A0Snakes in dr=\r\neams can have various meanings. Not all are good. But this one seems to me =\r\nlike a indication of a very specific kind of spiritual expeirence to come, =\r\nor would have come to you, had you not made any change =C2=A0in your routin=\r\ne sadhana.=C2=A0\n\n\nSpirituality has two parts. We start off with a desire t=\r\no experience God, we do whatever we think can help us in that, which can le=\r\nad to experiences which tell us we maybe come a bit closer. Then comes dige=\r\nsting them. To do so one has to have a stable mental and emotional conditio=\r\nn.\n\n\nFrom what you described my sanguine feeling is that a strong experienc=\r\ne was coming your way, but doubt and fear stopped it and made it recede bac=\r\nk. Now spiritual experiences are not like daily states of consciousness. If=\r\n they were, they would be no good. They are different. And that came make u=\r\ns feel unnerved at times.\n\n\nDid this happen due to homa? I think it was des=\r\ntined for you at some point. It could as well have happened one early morni=\r\nng as you were having a cup of tea without lifting a finger. What sadhana d=\r\noes - by which I mean homa, japa, yoga whatever - is change the patterns of=\r\n karma and accelerate the experiences that would have come to you anyway. B=\r\nut more than that it helps your mind-body to stabilize which is vital to be=\r\n able to integrate and digest an experience when it comes.=C2=A0\n\n\nSo witho=\r\nut thinking about it I would suggest that you keep doing sadhana, whatever =\r\nit maybe. As you do more, you nervous system will grow stronger, your emoti=\r\nonal, and mental sheath with become calmer and stabler and maybe the next t=\r\nime the Snake comes you won&#39;t feel unnerved! -:)\n\n\nWish you all the best.\n\n=\r\n\n-Regards\n\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\n\n\nI have a hundred lives before me yet/ To gra=\r\nsp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursu=\r\ne thee like a hunter through them all. -Sri Aurobindo\n\n\nFrom: &quot;ManiBhushan =\r\nsurya manibhushan@...

One of the main reasons being in this=\r\n point of Kali Yuga realistically speaking getting a Guru who has the Shakt=\r\ni\n and the Divine connect to pull a disciple off or cushion the disciple fr=\r\nom all experiences or prepare the disciple properly and make experiences di=\r\ngestible is quite rare to find. Gurus are many, but Gurus who can really co=\r\nntrol these stuff and give the right kind of Shakti are very very rare, and=\r\n it does not matter whether they are in some sampradaya or outside of all s=\r\nampradaya.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582=\r\n_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184727&quot;&gt;In such an environm=\r\nent doing ones own sadhana without waiting for a formal Guru is not a bad i=\r\ndea. Regarding homas there are two kinds of homas. One where it is a proces=\r\ns to connect to God using Agni Tattwa. When one prays in a temple to an ido=\r\nl one is trying to use Prithiwi Tattwa. Otherwise, in principle, both are s=\r\nimilar. Of course practical differences exist and that is due to the\n diffe=\r\nrence in the nature of the two great elements.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D=\r\n&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yui_3_=\r\n16_0_1_1446544625582_184813&quot;&gt;Then there is the homa done for Kriya-s or spe=\r\ncific results. That is complex and may require guidance. But I think PVR me=\r\nntions in his manuals that he does not encourage such homas or one should i=\r\ndeally use these only for the purpose of worshiping deities.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;=\r\nnone&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1=\r\n_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184846&quot;&gt;I sta=\r\nrted my first homa in 2007 when I did not know PVR or even this website. In=\r\nfact I come from an environment when is not particularly religious or ritua=\r\nlistic and I\n had frankly never even seen a homa. But the year before that =\r\nI had a strange and chance encounter with a spiritual man - who refuses to =\r\nbe addressed as a Guru - and he inspired me to try out spiritualiy. I becam=\r\ne curious and started sadhana with mantra japa. Then one day I felt a stron=\r\ng desire to do homas. I asked some people around me and all of them unanimo=\r\nusly told me not to do so. I still did anyway. &nbsp;Since then it has been=\r\n nearly 9 years I have been doing homas to different deities. Of course in =\r\nbetween now and then I have come across more advaced yogis who have kidly h=\r\nelped me or directed me or told me a step here and step there, rest I just =\r\nkept walking. This led to some experiences too over the years. But none of =\r\nthese yogis were really traditional Gurus, nor did anyone ever give me form=\r\nal diksha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_18=\r\n4339&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;\n id=3D&quot;yui_3_1=\r\n6_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_185296&quot;&gt;=\r\nOne of the main sadhanas which I was fortunate enough to do was Chandi homa=\r\ns. I remember one day I came across a very traditional individual who was s=\r\nhocked when I told him that I do this sadhana. He insisted that it cannot b=\r\ne done like this and it needs a guru and a diksha otherwise strong negative=\r\n consequences are bound to come due to the wrath of the Mother. Now I tend =\r\nto get bit aggressive when I find condescending people. So I told him that =\r\nI have done more than 500 Chandi homas (after which I have stopped counting=\r\n) and not only done them inside my home but in ancient and powerful Shakti =\r\npeethas, in deserted locales, in off beat places, but places fit for Shakti=\r\n sadhana, where many ordinary people would not venture easily. Now if he re=\r\nally believed what he said, that would mean that the Mother must have allow=\r\ned me to do these, for I did not face any wrath but only\n more opportunitie=\r\ns to intensify the sadhana. So I am assuming the big boss is OK with me doi=\r\nng things in a non-traditional fashion. He had nothing more to say.&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;=\r\n&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544=\r\n625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_185519&quot;&gt;I am not sayi=\r\nng or suggesting that tradition is wrong, it is there for a purpose but get=\r\nting the spirit of the rules in Tradition is far more important than blind =\r\nfollowing of the same. Traditions exist for the Deity, not the other way ro=\r\nund. And given the point in time where we are, I am afraid there will be mo=\r\nre and more souls who will worship and eventually interact with Deities out=\r\nside of formal traditions. For a soul who has done sadhana and wants to do =\r\nso, will always do so, Nature and the Deity will make it happen, irrespecti=\r\nve of whether s/he lines up with a tradition or not, whether\n s/he is born =\r\nin India or South Pole.

Because doubts make the sadhana go wrong, and the m=\r\nind itself will cause more obstructions that anyone or anything else.

We start off with a =\r\ndesire to experience God, we do whatever we think can help us in that, whic=\r\nh can lead to experiences which tell us we maybe come a bit closer. Then co=\r\nmes digesting them. To do so one has to have a stable mental and emotional =\r\ncondition.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr\n clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_=\r\n184339&quot;&gt;From what you described my sanguine feeling is that a strong experi=\r\nence was coming your way, but doubt and fear stopped it and made it recede =\r\nback. Now spiritual experiences are not like daily states of consciousness.=\r\n If they were, they would be no good. They are different. And that came mak=\r\ne us feel unnerved at times.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_14465=\r\n44625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0=\r\n_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;Did this happen due to homa? I think it was destin=\r\ned for you at some point. It could as well have happened one early morning =\r\nas you were having a cup of tea without lifting a finger. What sadhana does=\r\n - by which I mean homa, japa, yoga whatever - is change the patterns of ka=\r\nrma and accelerate the experiences that would have come to you anyway. But =\r\nmore than that it helps your mind-body to stabilize which is vital to be ab=\r\nle to\n integrate and digest an experience when it comes.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div di=\r\nr=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot; id=3D&quot;yui_3_16_0_1_1446544625582_184339&quot;&gt;So without think=\r\ning about it I would suggest that you keep doing sadhana, whatever it maybe=\r\n.
