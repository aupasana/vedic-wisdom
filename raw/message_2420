The human body functions with the help\nof a unique communicati=\r\non system -The Nerves. The nerves carry all messages\nbetween the various or=\r\ngans and The Brain. For perfect communication the\nnerves have to maintain p=\r\nerfect tension. Nature equips each body with\ncorrect settings (default tens=\r\nion). Due to various reasons like bad /\nunnatural habits, pollution, body a=\r\nbuse etc, we spoil this tension setting.\nThe messages get distorted. The or=\r\ngans fail to effectively communicate their\nneeds or problems and the Brain =\r\nfails to send the correct response.\n\nMudra Vigyan helps in restoring the de=\r\nfault tension naturally. By folding\ndifferent fingers in different manners,=\r\n and to different extents, different\ntensions can be provided to different =\r\nnerves to bring them to their default\nvalues. Messages start flowing proper=\r\nly, the brain can exercise authority\nonce again, the organs get proper dire=\r\nctives and can do what is required to\nmeet their needs.\n\nMudras can maintai=\r\nn good health. They can work as total cures by themselves\nor can be used as=\r\n effective aids to any form of treatment because they DO\nNOT interfere with=\r\n them, rather they only enhance their efficacy. They can\nbe done any time, =\r\nanywhere and need no prior preparation. Mudras correct the\nbasic cause henc=\r\ne, they can reverse destructive changes and provide\npermanent results.\n\nThe=\r\n Knowledge of the Science of Mudras transcends all age, colour, cast,\ncreed=\r\n and nationality. It is universally applicable. Thus, this session is\nopen =\r\nto all individuals and everyone is welcome to tune in\n\nWe look forward for =\r\nyour active participation and humbly request to share\nthis information with=\r\n all your contacts.\n*\n\nRegister now - *http://www.e-gurukul.net\n*\n\nSubscrip=\r\ntion procedure- After login - Select Trainings Management- Click on\nSubscri=\r\nbe to training - Select Live Web Sessions - Select the session name-\nClick =\r\non Subscribe*\n\nThank you\n\nHave a Fulfilling Day\n\nTeam@...\nwww.e-g=\r\nurukul.net\nAncient Practical Knowledge and Wisdom for New Age\n**\n\r\n--00504502b8514724960472a4cf6e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span lang=3D&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Greetings Everyone&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We are please=\r\nd to inform you about an &lt;/p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://mail.google.com/l%20L=\r\nIVE_WEB_SESSION&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot;=\r\n size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=3D&quot;EN-NZ&quot;&gt;UPCOMING INTERACTIVE LIVE AUDIO VISUAL FRE=\r\nE WEB SEMINAR&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;span lang=3D&quot;EN-NZ&quot;=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Please find details below and more information can be accessed in &lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://www.e-gurukul.net&quot;&gt;http://www.e-gurukul.net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=\r\nTopic&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/u&gt; - Miraculous Science of Mudras for Perpetual Health by Shree =\r\nVijay Bansalji - International Speaker and Author of Many Books.\n&lt;p&gt;To prom=\r\note the concept of total well being.
