Your method is interes=\r\nting for breaking down the words. My mother tongue is Tamil. I can speak an=\r\nd understand Tamil but unfortunately cannot read it. That is why I did not =\r\ndownload Tamil manual.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;It might be wrong in the meaning IN THE WAY YO=\r\nU WRITE, however when you memorize it and by always putting hyphen in betwe=\r\nen you know they form a single word, after memorizing you say it together v=\r\nery fast so there should not be any problem from the point of meaning WHEN =\r\nYOU SAY IT.\n\nOK, you&#39;re giving me the courage to do that. The key thing her=\r\ne as you say, is to memorize it, because I should not pause in between to r=\r\nemember it! With practice, it should become easier.\n\nI would like to upload=\r\n a hyphenated version - with long words hyphenated in a way that&#39;ll be easi=\r\ner for me to say together fast. I&#39;m just curious to think what your opinion=\r\n of that would be.\n\nThanks again,\n\nAlamelu\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;Tanvir&quot; &lt;tan.vir@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste.\n&gt; \n&gt; I understand that you=\r\n have quite a bit of problem because you have a long list of words :-)\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Since I don&#39;t know Sanskrit, I cannot solve each of the words but I can de=\r\nfinitely tell you my way of doing things. May be it can help. It is not nec=\r\nessarily the correct method but it might be better for someone who has no w=\r\nay / no help :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Since my mother tongue Bengali is very close to Sansk=\r\nrit, sometimes I have an idea of the word meanings and thus I am able to br=\r\neak words down.\n&gt; \n&gt; As an example, in the beginning Vighneshwara prarthna,=\r\n (initial prayer to Lord Ganesha to remove obstacles), there is a word PRAS=\r\nANNAVADANAM. Since I know PRASANNA means &quot;pleased&quot;, so I know it is a separ=\r\nate word so I can break it like PRASANNA-VADANAM.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I break a word,=\r\n in my own writing I put hyphen(s) between the two/three/four parts so when=\r\n memorizing, and even after memorizing is done, I always know that these pa=\r\nrts together form a bigger word so I have to utter them fast.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarl=\r\ny, I break SARVAKARYESHU into SARVA-KARYESHU... SARVA (All) + KARYESHU (Wor=\r\nk/Action/something related like this).\n&gt; \n&gt; KOTISURYASAMAPRABHA =3D KOTI-SU=\r\nRYA-SAMA-PRABHA\n&gt; \n&gt; Second way, when you don&#39;t know the meaning, or don&#39;t =\r\nhave a clue, simply try to break them down in a way that helps you remember=\r\n the whole word better and easily.\n&gt; \n&gt; As an example, in the very first pr=\r\nayer (Anugya - seeking permission), there is a big word HAVYAIRNAMASOPASADY=\r\nA... \n&gt; I break it into HAVYARNAMA-SOPASADYA... (You mentioned it too)\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n It might be wrong in the meaning IN THE WAY YOU WRITE, however when you me=\r\nmorize it and by always putting hyphen in between you know they form a sing=\r\nle word, after memorizing you say it together very fast so there should not=\r\n be any problem from the point of meaning WHEN YOU SAY IT.\n&gt; \n&gt; One thing t=\r\nop of all I want to assure you : Once you break the words and memorize the =\r\nmantra, you will find the whole big word to be very easy and you will have =\r\nabsolutely no problem anymore to remember and utter the whole big word very=\r\n easily. So don&#39;t fear, just memorize it by breaking in a way convenient to=\r\n you! :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Tanvir\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;=\r\n   From: anp10033 \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Sunday, =\r\n18 August, 2013 7:26 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Splitting up of the=\r\n long Sanskrit words in Homam manual\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Ok Tanvirji, thanks very muc=\r\nh for your help.

However, I felt quite intimidated, so I did not act upon them. Lately, =\r\nI kept coming back to the site and decided to take it step by step to gain =\r\nconfidence, so I have started reading the text of Shri Maha Ganapathi homam=\r\n till the word flow is fluent. I&#39;m less intimidated by it now. I&#39;m also qui=\r\nte grateful to Shri Narasimhaji for making it available as I have been want=\r\ning to do this for a long time. But am still not ready to start it. The rea=\r\nson is that certain words are so long that, to maintain a flow, I need to s=\r\nplit the word into bits that will help maintain the flow but need to know w=\r\nhere to split in order that I don&#39;t change the meaning of it. I&#39;m following=\r\n the Sanskrit version. I want to include the words (a long list) in the hop=\r\ne that one of you members can help me split them up in the right way, but m=\r\ny computer does not type the sanskrit words, nor am I able to copy and past=\r\ne the sanskrit word, it does not do allow it.
