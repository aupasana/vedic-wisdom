I\n&gt; lo=\r\nve Mata Parvati as Mother, Shiva as Father, Gananatha and Karthikeya as my\n=\r\n&gt; own siblings. I have such love for the family that I don&#39;t start my day\n&gt;=\r\n without praying to all the four! Daily I do abhishekham for a small Spatik=\r\na\n&gt; Lingam, in which I see both Shiva and Parvathi, I do ganapathi mantra j=\r\napam\n&gt; everyday and I recite Subramanya Karavalamba stotram. When I don&#39;t d=\r\no it, it\n&gt; is not a day for me. (&#39;Deva Devuni Chintinchu dinamu dinamu.....=\r\n..&#39; !) And I\n&gt; get tears when I listen to Bhagavatam or Thyagaraja/Dikshita=\r\nr/Annamayya et\n&gt; al... Krithis. In spite of having won some recognition in =\r\nmy small community\n&gt; as a musician/vidwan, releasing a CD playing my chosen=\r\n instrument Veena, I\n&gt; cannot even sing some compositons some times because=\r\n of the overwhelming\n&gt; emotion.

Anyway, that apart, I did Gayatri S=\r\nadhana for sometime now and\n&gt; want to continue someday in the method you/Ma=\r\nnishji suggested, like the\n&gt; hundred day diksha! I don&#39;t know when the time=\r\n will come for that!

It is just\n&gt; an &quot;order&quot;. Your actions gets opposite reactions=\r\n. You experience the fruits\n&gt; of your actions, as determined by the order o=\r\nf nature. A person may happen\n&gt; to be doing what he sees as his dharma and =\r\nearthquake may strike there and\n&gt; kill him. If so, there must be a previous=\r\n karma as a result of which he is\n&gt; placed there at that time.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the c=\r\nase of the priest in the story, his mistake is that he slapped a\n&gt; person w=\r\norshipping god. If he had no way of assessing the bhava (feeling) in\n&gt; the =\r\nmind of the person doing the worship, he should&#39;ve given the benefit of\n&gt; d=\r\noubt and assumed it was a sincere devotee, rather than assuming it was a\n&gt; =\r\nfool.\n&gt;\n&gt; See, when Ramakrishna went there and saw Trilinga Swami, he immed=\r\niately\n&gt; knew the stature and remarked that this is Viswanatha himself. How=\r\never,\n&gt; others may not be so fortunate. You only saw a body with some body =\r\nparts and\n&gt; some clothes and nothing beyond it. If so, give the benefit of =\r\ndoubt and\n&gt; treat kindly and respectfully. Just because of external paramet=\r\ners, do not\n&gt; judge a person and act harsh.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hitting a person who still =\r\nhas a limited self-identification is one thing\n&gt; and hitting a person who h=\r\nas no limited self-identification and identifies\n&gt; with the entire universe=\r\n or with a deity is different.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; In any case, do not worry abou=\r\nt that priest that much. For all you know, he\n&gt; may be an associate of Shiv=\r\na who came along with Trilinga Swami to enact a\n&gt; story and teach a moral a=\r\nnd he may have gone back to Shiva. Even if not, he\n&gt; was lucky to enact an =\r\nimportant role in an interesting divine drama.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Jeevanmuktas m=\r\nay engage in actions that are difficult to comprehend. They\n&gt; have no perso=\r\nnal ego, will and agenda. They become instruments for Nature to\n&gt; fulfil th=\r\ne Natural order. The action of Trilinga Swami may help several\n&gt; people que=\r\nstion, challenge and overcome their biases and learn some\n&gt; important lesso=\r\nns, centuries after he left earth.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding many gods: As I =\r\nkeep emphasizing, yogis and saints sometimes give\n&gt; advices based on desa-k=\r\naala-paatra or advices geared at a specific set of\n&gt; people.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is n=\r\nothing wrong in having many deities in pooja room and worshipping\n&gt; all. Su=\r\nch people may lead fruitful dharmik lives. However, Vimalananda may\n&gt; not b=\r\ne concerned about such people. His teachings may be addressed at some\n&gt; oth=\r\ner people to come in the coming years who he has rina with and who are\n&gt; me=\r\nant to achieve saayujya of some deities and do some work. There is an\n&gt; int=\r\nended audience for every work and no work can be perfect for all\n&gt; audience=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the goal is either liberation or a deity&#39;s darshan (vision) or saa=\r\nyujya\n&gt; (company), one has to agree that focusing on one deity is the best =\r\nthing to\n&gt; do, rather than trying to focus mind on ten deities and keep swi=\r\ntching. A\n&gt; deity comes when mind and its thoughts are filled with that dei=\r\nty&#39;s name and\n&gt; mantra and other thoughts are driven away from the mind. Vi=\r\nmalananda perhaps\n&gt; wanted to motivate several people to strive for vision/=\r\ncompany of deities.\n&gt; He probably thought some people he has a rina with wo=\r\nuld come to earth with\n&gt; such a potential.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Thyagaraja did com=\r\npose songs on many deities. But, he first had a darshan\n&gt; of Rama. He spent=\r\n several years chanting Rama&#39;s name and had a darshan. Then\n&gt; he composed s=\r\nongs on many deities. However, he saw all of them as different\n&gt; emanations=\r\n from Rama. He saw Rama in all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Same with Aadi Shankara, Muththuswamy D=\r\neekshitar, Bammera Pothana and\n&gt; others.\n&gt;\n&gt; When one achieves perfection i=\r\nn surrender to one deity, one&#39;s life is made.\n&gt; After that, one will see th=\r\ne same deity in all deities even if he worships\n&gt; 100 deities. If one is sw=\r\nitching between ten deities before that, it may not\n&gt; be helpful in filling=\r\n the mind with thoughts of any of those deities. Mind\n&gt; sees those deities =\r\nas different objects and may not fully surrender to any\n&gt; of them. Still, a=\r\ns I said, one may lead a fruitful dhaarmik life. That&#39;s\n&gt; fine.\n&gt;\n&gt; But, if=\r\n you really want to taste the nectar of complete surrender, it is\n&gt; better =\r\nto pick one deity and fill the mind with his/her thoughts.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nExcellent answers on each thread and mother showed her divine\n&gt; &gt; grace thr=\r\nough you that I am able to find answers to many\n&gt; &gt; questions that my immat=\r\nure mind keeps on asking!\n&gt;\n&gt; Though I had some spiritual experiences fortu=\r\nnately, I am not a realized\n&gt; person.

I do understand tha=\r\nt Telang Swamy might have\n&gt; been a great yogi but my point is how are we to=\r\n understand that greatness\n&gt; and in that context what is ununsual in the pr=\r\niest&#39;s reaction that God had\n&gt; to punish him that hard! If priest was aware=\r\n and still did that, then I can\n&gt; understand the consequence. I haven&#39;t yet=\r\n the second book though! Probably\n&gt; that will explain.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, I unde=\r\nrstand RamaKrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s famous &#39;Dig at one place 10\n&gt; feet instea=\r\nd of 1 foot at 10 places if you want to find water&#39;. But contrary\n&gt; to that=\r\n we find great saints / composers / poets from India have indeed\n&gt; worshipp=\r\ned many forms of the God and were successful in that approach as\n&gt; well. Fo=\r\nr instance, there is not a single deity form that was not worshipped\n&gt; by A=\r\ndi Sankara and/or Muththuswamy Dikshitar. It was famous that\n&gt; Muththuswamy=\r\n Dikshitar was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka and he left his\n&gt; mortal coi=\r\nl by singing to Madurai MeenakshiDevi in the presence of many of\n&gt; his disc=\r\niples. But he composed songs of deep devotion that have immense\n&gt; power and=\r\n depth on Lord Shiva, Ganesha, Subramanya, Rama and so on. So was\n&gt; Thyagar=\r\naja. So were many great composers of Carnatic Music in that path. In\n&gt; fact=\r\n they were all great advaitis and never saw any difference between any\n&gt; fo=\r\nrm of the God, what soever. Bammera Pothana, a great poet of Andhra who\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n translated Bhagavatam, in his opening invocatory poems, pays homage to\n&gt; L=\r\nord Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, Ganesha, Saraswati, Brahmi, Durga, Lakshmi in\n&gt; =\r\nthat order before declaring that he got the divine inspiration from Lord\n&gt; =\r\nRama to write the Stories of Krishna! Where is the difference between any\n&gt;=\r\n form of God here! I wonder. So, I was not able to comprehend why Vimalanan=\r\nda\n&gt; accuses many Hindus of having a chaotic mind just because their puja\n&gt;=\r\n mandirams are filled with many photographs/ idols of different murthis of\n=\r\n&gt; Almighty.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nagraj\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhagaru,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Excellent an=\r\nswers on each thread and mother showed her divine grace\n&gt; through you that =\r\nI am able to find answers to many questions that my\n&gt; immature mind keeps o=\r\nn asking!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, coming back to the topic, some of the topics I fo=\r\nund disturbing\n&gt; in the first book of Aghora are as follows:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1. On =\r\nthe page 45 it says that Telang swami performed the ritual bath of\n&gt; Kashi =\r\nVishveshwara with his own urine and feces. What could be the\n&gt; compelling r=\r\neason for this bizarre behavior and why should the priest who\n&gt; slapped him=\r\n die, because in my opinion, anyone else would have done the same\n&gt; in the =\r\nleast! Since you have an excellent way to explain many seemingly\n&gt; disturbi=\r\nng things, I hope to find and answer here.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2. In quite a few places=\r\n, Vimalananda equates changing the loyalty from\n&gt; diety to diety as akin to=\r\n prostitution, which I find as an extreme view! If\n&gt; that were true, why wo=\r\nuld Adi Sankara compose so many hymns in praise of so\n&gt; many dieties, Thyag=\r\naraja composed in the praise of Sri Rama, Krishna, Shiva,\n&gt; Ganesha and Jag=\r\nanmata as well. So are so many great composers / poets. The\n&gt; examples of T=\r\nulasidas and Leelashuka where they wanted to see their favorite\n&gt; deity for=\r\nm only (rama in the case of former and krishna in the case of\n&gt; latter) des=\r\npite knowing that the other form is the same supreme being, are\n&gt; only a ve=\r\nry minority in the list of Bhaktas that we have? Why this kind of a\n&gt; view.=\r\n I see myself being equally in the love and awe of every form of god,\n&gt; nam=\r\nely Shiva, rama, krishna, ganesha, amba, subramanya, anjaneya and so on!\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nagraj\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 3/2/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. ne=\r\nt&lt;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dpvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&lt;http://us.mc819.ma=\r\nil.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dpvr%40charter.net&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Surrender (Re: Aghora books..)\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;=\r\nhttp://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, March 2, 2010, 6:31 PM\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; N=\r\namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; How to achieve it effectivey?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If it can be achiev=\r\ned easily, we will not have so many spiritual paths\n&gt; and so many sadhanas.=\r\n All spiritual paths, scriptures, teachings and\n&gt; spiritual sadhanas are me=\r\nant for this only.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vasishtha teaches in Yoga Vaasishtham that one c=\r\nan read scriptures,\n&gt; contemplate their teachings, spend time in the compan=\r\ny of spiritual people\n&gt; and engage in one&#39;s natural activities with dispass=\r\nion, in order to progress\n&gt; fast.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let me quote someth=\r\ning from Ramakrishna. Look at your belongings (spouse,\n&gt; children, job, hou=\r\nse, cars, wealth, name, fame, and even body) as the\n&gt; property of god. Imag=\r\nine that you are a temporary caretaker, just as a\n&gt; servant may be living i=\r\nn a rich person&#39;s house as the caretaker as that\n&gt; person stays away. Think=\r\n of all that is in your hands as the sacred property\n&gt; of your master and t=\r\nake care like a committed servant. A servant takes the\n&gt; best care of his m=\r\naster&#39;s property, but does not get attached. Do not be\n&gt; attached anything =\r\nand yet take the best possible care. If something goes\n&gt; wrong, do not worr=\r\ny too much and tell yourself that the master will take\n&gt; care of it when he=\r\n gets a chance to look at it. Think for a moment how a\n&gt; servant taking car=\r\ne of the properties of a master living away thinks and\n&gt; behaves.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nf one can attain the spirit and mental state of the servant in this\n&gt; analo=\r\ngy, one&#39;s life will be made.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Read what Manish wrote b=\r\nelow:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Once you take Time out of the equation (because a deity h=\r\nas a\n&gt; different time space frame which runs in thousands of years which pa=\r\nss by in\n&gt; a blink of an eye) by waiting with patience, then where will God=\r\n go? God has\n&gt; to come, He can&#39;t escape.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Take time out of the e=\r\nquation, i.e. do not put a time limit or say &quot;I\n&gt; have done this sadhana fo=\r\nr XYZ years.

Otherwi=\r\nse,\n&gt; Arjuna could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have written off the wrongs of the Kauravas as=\r\n a massive rnu, but\n&gt; of course,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna urged him to take up the=\r\n dharma of kshatriyahood and slay\n&gt; without\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mercy. The webs of ka=\r\nrma are too intricate and complex and delicate\n&gt; to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comprehend=\r\ned unless one has reached certain very very high levels\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spir=\r\nitual attainment, and even then, it will only be a partial\n&gt; vision. Only\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; S/He who is unlimited (Iswara/i) knows and sees the entire web of\n=\r\n&gt; karma and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knows best how to dispatch rnus as necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Aditiji and others,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun c=\r\nould do what he did for a reason.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was a great sadhaka himse=\r\nlf.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What he did was sort of simple. He did so much sadhana of a d=\r\neity\n&gt; that this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deity began to occupy him day and night. This de=\r\nity was a form of\n&gt; Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That in turn gave him the rarest of ra=\r\nre opportunity to be with\n&gt; Krishna at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time of the battle, be=\r\ncause Shiva is the greatest Vaishnava,\n&gt; the only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one who knows h=\r\now to worship Krishna properly. Only by becoming\n&gt; Shiva\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself=\r\n can you worship Krishna perfectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, at the time of=\r\n the battle, Arjun was beset with doubt, but\n&gt; when he saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Vi=\r\nswharoopa something crazy happened as if Krishna was within\n&gt; him. Of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; course Krishna was present even before, but Arjun could not\n&gt; perceive=\r\n Him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; properly. this was Krishna&#39;s lila or play of course, because=\r\n\n&gt; otherwise would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun have treated him as a friend ever??!!(sl=\r\napping Him on the\n&gt; back,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; playing tricks on Him, but the Lord lov=\r\nes to play with His genuine\n&gt; devotees)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, now once Ar=\r\njun&#39;s remnant personality was further effaced and\n&gt; replaced by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; K=\r\nrishna in his form as Kaala Viswharoopa, then it was effectively\n&gt; Krishna\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who destroyed the Kauravas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why at the end of t=\r\nhe battle when all the Pandavas went to\n&gt; ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person who had =\r\nbeen decapitated by Krishna&#39;s Sudarshana but who was\n&gt; still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kept=\r\n alive at the top of the tree,..... about who was responsible\n&gt; for the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Pandava&#39;s victory..... ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that man said was that at =\r\nthe beginning of the day he could see\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sudarshana start out =\r\nfrom one end of the battlefield, then having\n&gt; done all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that dest=\r\nruction, it would return to krishna&#39;s hand at the end of\n&gt; the day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; And the blood which was being spilt was drunk by Krishna Shakti or\n&gt; Kal=\r\ni.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was lucky, He had God incarnate at His side, o=\r\nthers may not\n&gt; be quite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so fortunate. For example, Ramakrishna u=\r\nsed to say that a doctor&#39;s\n&gt; money was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blood and pus (I left my t=\r\nhriving surgical career when I read this\n&gt; a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years ago).\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He said something similar about the money earned by a lawyer.(I\n&gt; thi=\r\nnk he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; referring to criminal law in that time).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Easiest thing to do is Ishwar(Ishwari) pranidhana.

Though\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concept\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time,\n=\r\n&gt; the concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much the=\r\nre. Valmiki was a shudra who\n&gt; lived by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. He bec=\r\name a brahmana and a maharshi later.\n&gt; Vishwamitra was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a\n&gt; mah=\r\narshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts=\r\n off\n&gt; with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; varna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of father, because that is =\r\nwhat one is exposed to in childhood.\n&gt; As one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; develops in lif=\r\ne, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one\n&gt; does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you\n&gt; to =\r\nknow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreov=\r\ner, there are not just 4\n&gt; dharmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the world. =\r\nEach person has individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what=\r\n one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If\n&gt; one is pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a\n&gt; part of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is, but i=\r\nt is surrounded by\n&gt; a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noise from other parts of our m=\r\ninds which tell other things.\n&gt; Thus, we get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment combining discrimina=\r\ntion and\n&gt; intuition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is our dharm=\r\na and follow it sincerely. We may be\n&gt; err, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mor=\r\ne than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to\n&gt; engage in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we\n&gt; a=\r\nre not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load.=\r\n We\n&gt; should not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too much attachment to wha=\r\nt we are doing. We should engage in\n&gt; the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible actio=\r\nns (based on our best judgment on what our dharma\n&gt; in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with as little attachment and\n&gt; self-identif=\r\nication with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. When the action is finis=\r\nhed, we should\n&gt; leave the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We shou=\r\nld not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;will it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nork&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication\n&gt; through\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; untached action) will simplify our ego and purify our\n&gt; consciousn=\r\ness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will wor=\r\nk sharper and tell our\n&gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clearer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is=\r\n a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us\n&gt; to see our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This\n&gt; is =\r\nnot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not following =\r\none&#39;s dharma,\n&gt; one&#39;s sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma=\r\n&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in\n&gt; action with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; litt=\r\nle attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the\n&gt; inputs.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another external input is the words of scriptures and learne=\r\nd\n&gt; men. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A=\r\n special place is given to\n&gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mast=\r\ner. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take\n&gt; the words\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it =\r\nsincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what =\r\nhis dharma was and thought\n&gt; killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gurus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and re=\r\nlatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who\n&gt; clarified his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused\n&gt; about =\r\nhis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wanted to renounce the world and g=\r\no to a secluded place to\n&gt; do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishn=\r\na Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mat=\r\nerial\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one\n=\r\n&gt; is, what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debts are and what nature expect=\r\ns from one can err in the\n&gt; judgment of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;=\r\ns dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear\n&gt; insight\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect gu=\r\nidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Botto=\r\nmline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of\n&gt; principles and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to\n&gt; pe=\r\nrson,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to time and from place to place. =\r\nAlso, there are no\n&gt; thumbrules to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out what =\r\none&#39;s dharma is.

By doing various k=\r\ninds of\n&gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engag=\r\ning in actions without\n&gt; much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attachment, one can slowly puri=\r\nfy oneself and refine one&#39;s\n&gt; understanding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on=\r\ne&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to persist\n=\r\n&gt; so long as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahams=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi Banerj=\r\nee\n&gt; &lt;banerjeea@gmail. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree with Dinesh.

But he takes it to extre=\r\nmes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3? =C3? =C3? =C3? =C3? =C3? =C3? *=C3? =C3? =C3? =C3? =C3? =\r\n=C3? =C3? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all =\r\nis Self. The variety we perceive is an\n&gt; illusion&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora p=\r\nursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both\n&gt; impermenant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; illusions and the only permanent reality within them is the Self,\n&gt; he\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a\n&gt; r=\r\nitual where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feces is eaten.=C3? But, please remember that eatin=\r\ng feces is not\n&gt; the main\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point. Perceiving Self in the food be=\r\ning consumed and not\n&gt; perceiving an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermanent manifestation =\r\nof Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main\n&gt; point. For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, e=\r\nating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a\n&gt; person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self\n&gt; (&quot;feces&quot;) wh=\r\nile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the=\r\n mind\n&gt; will not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;fec=\r\nes&quot; with certain\n&gt; properties and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not feel any kind of dis=\r\ngust. He will be thinking that he is\n&gt; Self and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he is eating Se=\r\nlf.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions really.\n&gt; He chan=\r\nts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am =\r\nSelf\n&gt; and I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting ma=\r\ny merely be a\n&gt; ritual and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be fully absorbed in one&#39;s think=\r\ning. As he eats, his mind may\n&gt; dwell on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermanant manife=\r\nstations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly\n&gt; cooked brinjal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cu=\r\nrry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling t=\r\nhemselves the\n&gt; same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truth and trying to absorb that truth into=\r\n every thought and\n&gt; impulse. But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aghora is putting himself in =\r\nan extreme situation where failure\n&gt; results in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very bad dual=\r\n experience. That can in fact work as an incentive\n&gt; in forcing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a\n&gt; Vedic ver=\r\nse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty=\r\n\n&gt; laddus and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nicely made food, the fallout from failing to abs=\r\norb the mind in\n&gt; Self while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating is not too bad. If the mind=\r\n dwells on the nice (or even\n&gt; not-so-nice)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taste of a laddu or=\r\n other food, what is the big deal? On the\n&gt; other hand, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the =\r\nmind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of\n&gt; feces, it will\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very\n&gt;=\r\n bad dual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quic=\r\nkly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be\n&gt; accomplished by=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying\n&gt;=\r\n Aghora sadhanas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3? =C3? =C3? =C3? =C3? =C3? =C3? *=C3? =C3?=\r\n =C3? =C3? =C3? =C3? =C3? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose some=\r\none is doing a\n&gt; lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet =\r\nhaving a weakness for sex.\n&gt; Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s mind is dwe\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
