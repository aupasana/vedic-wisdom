However the white part is juicy and when I experimented with it, it =\r\ndoes not burn even after staying in the fire for quite a long time! Today i=\r\ns the third day that I kept the coconut slices open to dry, but they still =\r\nare not dry enough to burn. I guess they might take even 8-10 or even 15 da=\r\nys.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I don&#39;t want to wait that long to start my homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Narasim=\r\nha Ji, you have mentioned that fire can be done with wood instead of coconu=\r\nt. So if I do the fire with twig or wood, the only time I would need coconu=\r\nt is for Purnahuti. Since dry coconut is not available now, can I do purnah=\r\nuti with a big stream of spoonful ghee? Logically it might be acceptable, s=\r\nince I am offering only ghee as ahuti, so why not a big amount of ghee as p=\r\nurna (full) ahuti? Also I read in the archieve that in deepa-homam, purnahu=\r\nti can be done with ghee.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kindly confirm.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Tanvir\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
