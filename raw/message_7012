I want to share 2\n&gt; cents of mu=\r\nsings on that.\n&gt;\n&gt; -------------------------------\n&gt; Measuring Spiritual Ca=\r\nliber\n&gt;\n&gt; Rajarshi, here are a few comments on your statements a couple of =\r\ndays\n&gt; back on Twitter comparing spiritual caliber. We can&#39;t even compare\n&gt;=\r\n flowers like hibiscus, rose, jasmine, mogra, kewda, lotus etc & say\n&gt; whic=\r\nh is a better flower. They have different properties like color,\n&gt; size, sh=\r\nape, number of petals, type/intensity of smell etc. Relative\n&gt; values depen=\r\nd on the purpose and they cannot be quantified universally.\n&gt; How can any s=\r\nane person then say that spiritual caliber of different\n&gt; people can be com=\r\npared and quanitified? The field of duality has\n&gt; infinite variety and the =\r\n[self-]control of a yogi has infinite aspects\n&gt; to it. You cannot quantify =\r\nthe spiritual caliber of a person as one\n&gt; number and compare them.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bef=\r\nore one even attempts to understand Vimalananda&#39;s order (Paramahamsa\n&gt; &lt; Si=\r\nddha &lt; Natha &lt; Rishi), please note that different hierarchies exist\n&gt; in sc=\r\nriptures for deities also. Some consider a hierarchy of deities\n&gt; where Vis=\r\nhnu is supreme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where\n&gt; Shiva is supre=\r\nme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where Shakti is\n&gt; supreme. And so =\r\non. None of them is absolute. All of them are relative\n&gt; and for specific p=\r\nurposes, i.e. from a specific perspective. There are\n&gt; people who take them=\r\n as absolute and argue that so and so thing taught\n&gt; by Vishnu is superior =\r\nto so and so thing taught by Shiva, etc. But we\n&gt; know that none of the hie=\r\nrarchies is absolute.\n&gt;\n&gt; One who has the nerve to think that one can compa=\r\nre the wisdom of\n&gt; Jnaneshwar, dispassion of Ramana Maharshi, mad devotion =\r\nof Ramakrishna\n&gt; Paramahamsa, detached activism of Vivekananda, compassion =\r\nof Shirdi Sai,\n&gt; spiritual ecstasy of Vama Khepa, inner clarity of Lahiri M=\r\nahashaya,\n&gt; detachment of Trilinga Swami, purity of Tukaram, humility of Ek=\r\nnath\n&gt; Maharaj, ecstatic love of Meera Bai, motherly love of Gopaler Ma, et=\r\nc,\n&gt; is a fool of the highest order. They can be compared from specific\n&gt; l=\r\nimited perspectives. In one thing, Tukaram may be superior to all, in\n&gt; ano=\r\nther Jnaneshwar, in another Trilinga, in another Ramakrishna, and so\n&gt; on. =\r\nYou cannot compare in absolute terms. You should not even try to.\n&gt; You sho=\r\nuld just appreciate them individually and aspire to be like any\n&gt; of them t=\r\nhat you like the most.\n&gt;\n&gt; Vimalananda&#39;s list may be correct from specific =\r\nperspective. More\n&gt; importantly, his words should make one realize that the=\r\nre is always\n&gt; scope for further self-control (and the resulting mastery ov=\r\ner the field\n&gt; of duality) while one is still embodied. One should never re=\r\nst and\n&gt; aspire for better self-control. But taking it as gospel and starti=\r\nng to\n&gt; judge yogis based on that is unwise. Especially making statements l=\r\nike\n&gt; &quot;Vimalananda is heavier than all RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot; and thinkin=\r\ng\n&gt; that something is absolute truth because Vimalananda is assumed to have=\r\n\n&gt; said that (vs someone &quot;lower than him&quot;) is unwise.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even if Vimalanan=\r\nda&#39;s hierarchy is absolute and universal, don&#39;t assume\n&gt; that you can judge=\r\n the stature of each yogi accurately. Because\n&gt; Ramakrishna was popularly k=\r\nnown as a Paramahamsa, is he a Paramahamsa as\n&gt; per Vimalananda&#39;s classific=\r\nation or a siddha or a natha or even a rishi?\n&gt; Or may be a deity? My frien=\r\nd, don&#39;t assume you know for sure!!! Based on\n&gt; the details we know, can we=\r\n be absolutely sure of even Vimalananda&#39;s\n&gt; stature based on his own classi=\r\nfication?\n&gt;\n&gt; You said &quot;Approximating 2 equal to each disciples of ramakris=\r\nhna. 2exp16\n&gt; =3D say Vimalananda. Basic?&quot; You probably made this statement=\r\n based on\n&gt; what you read and heard of Vimalananda. For the sake of argumen=\r\nt, it is\n&gt; not even 100% clear whether he was a real person or an imagined\n=\r\n&gt; character. Svoboda intentionally (and very wisely!) left the latter\n&gt; opt=\r\nion open in the preface of his Aghora book!\n&gt;\n&gt; If we MUST compare spiritua=\r\nl calibers, one possibility is to use a\n&gt; simpler definition of how close o=\r\nne is to liberation as a measure of\n&gt; one&#39;s &quot;spiritual caliber&quot;, Ramakrishn=\r\na&#39;s disciples fare quite well. RK\n&gt; told Abhedananda that it was going to b=\r\ne his last birth. Others would be\n&gt; back, but he would be liberated. To Yog=\r\nananda, he said there would be\n&gt; one more birth and he would be free foreve=\r\nr after that. Vimalananda, on\n&gt; the other hand, had atleast one more birth =\r\nclearly as he said a body was\n&gt; waiting for him. That way, forget about &quot;RK=\r\n&#39;s discples put togtr&quot;, just\n&gt; Abhedananda alone is superior to Vimalananda=\r\n!\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, please note that this is just one definition. One can have man=\r\ny\n&gt; definitions. The key is not to jump to unwise conclusions on any\n&gt; hier=\r\narchies and say that &quot;X is weightier than Y and so what he said must\n&gt; be m=\r\nore correct&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; People with lopsided understanding of scriptures take rel=\r\native knowledge\n&gt; to be absolute and jump to unwise conclusions. I am afrai=\r\nd some people\n&gt; are doing the same now with &quot;modern scriptures&quot; such as the=\r\n Aghora\n&gt; books. Don&#39;t fall into the trap of taking something as gospel or =\r\nas\n&gt; absolute. Written words are always relative and never absolute.\n&gt; Disc=\r\nriminate relative knowledge using intellect at first and hopefully\n&gt; using =\r\nexperencial realization later on.\n&gt;\n&gt; More importantly, while we are still =\r\nsearching for &quot;maturity&quot;, we should\n&gt; not commit the &quot;error&quot; of making nega=\r\ntive judgmental comments of greats\n&gt; who did far more sadhana than us and e=\r\nxperienced a lot more than us.\n&gt; -------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; Best r=\r\negards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;D=\r\no It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilm=\r\ns.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish =\r\nwritings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Twitter ID: @homa=\r\nm108\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--20cf303bfb5a36026704a961aaa1\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nRespected Narasimhaji&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To Yogananda, he said there would be &lt;br&gt;\no=\r\nne more birth and he would be free forever after that.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As far as=\r\n I know Swami Yogananda or Yogin Maharaj was the first disciple if Sri Maa.=\r\n &lt;br&gt;Sri Maa had told one disciple after Swami Yogananda&#39;s passing away=\r\n that Thakur had told her Swamiji belonged to an amsa of Arjun and she also=\r\n told he gave up his life so early(he was the first among Thakur&#39;s sann=\r\nyasi disciples to leave the mortal frame) due to the terrible penances he p=\r\nracticed that took a heavy toll on his physical frame.&lt;br&gt;\nThis is mentoned=\r\n in Sri Sri Mayer Katha bengali edition Part 2.&lt;br&gt;Can you please mention N=\r\narasimhaji from where you read the above.part.?&lt;br&gt;Just wanted to know.Noth=\r\ning otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;\nOn Sun, Jul 31=\r\n, 2011 at 10:15 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mail=\r\nto:pvr@...&quot;&gt;pvr@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;p=\r\nadding-left:1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color:#fff=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;Nama=\r\nste friends,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThere was a long friendly ;-) exchange between Rajars=\r\nhi and me on Friday &lt;br&gt;\n(July 29) on twitter on measuring spiritual calibe=\r\nr.

Written words are always relative and never absolute. &lt;br&gt;\nDi=\r\nscriminate relative knowledge using intellect at first and hopefully &lt;br&gt;\nu=\r\nsing experencial realization later on.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMore importantly, while we =\r\nare still searching for &quot;maturity&quot;, we should &lt;br&gt;\nnot commit the=\r\n &quot;error&quot; of making negative judgmental comments of greats &lt;br&gt;\nwh=\r\no did far more sadhana than us and experienced a lot more than us.&lt;br&gt;\n----=\r\n---------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBest regards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n   Free Jyotish So=\r\nftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Do It Yourself&qu=\r\not; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n                 =\r\n  &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      Films that make a difference: &lt;a href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n      Spirituality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n   =\r\nJyotish writings: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;=\r\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n  =\r\n                    Twitter ID: @homam108&lt;br&gt;\n-----------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--20cf303bfb5a36026704a961aaa1--\r\n\n"}}
