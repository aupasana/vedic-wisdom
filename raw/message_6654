I would like to suggest from my own method which ma=\r\ny help you bring down 20 minutes to 10Min.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) First of all, It is advi=\r\nsable to avoid Aluminum Foil. Aluminum foil cutting for correct size and th=\r\nen adjusting on Homa kundam takes a good amount of time. I did it for some =\r\n6 months initially and then there was a Message from Narasimha that it is b=\r\netter to avoid Aluminum foil because Aluminum being a relatively modern met=\r\nal and may carry Rahu&#39;s predominance. I stopped foil since then...\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) =\r\nNo need to wash Homa Kundam every day. I do it once in a month or so. Let i=\r\nt be black and dark.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the above 2 points are observed, it can save s=\r\nome 5 to 7 minutes easily.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, one can do following arrangements prev=\r\nious nights (the people who do Homa in the morning)\n&gt; \n&gt; -Empty the Homa Ku=\r\nndam and keep it clean (Tissue papers are very handy for this) and ready fo=\r\nr next morning\n&gt; - Keep the Dry Coconut pieces or Wood ready.\n&gt; - Keep the =\r\nLamp ready with Wick\n&gt; - Keep Camphor, Rice mixed with ghee and turmeric, F=\r\nlowers, etc... ready. (I do not use flowers any more. Use Akshatas mixed wi=\r\nth Turmeric as flowers..Bhagwan ko bolta hun BhavnaO ko Samjho! Phul ki jag=\r\nape Chawal se kaam chalalo:-)\n&gt; \n&gt; So when I get ready for Homam, I just ha=\r\nve to fill up the copper tumbler with water and heat up the ghee and few ot=\r\nher such activities which takes around 5to7 Minutes in total.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before i=\r\n forget i must remind that there is no need to keep the Darbha in 4 directi=\r\nons every time. One can keep those Darbhas at the same place as many days a=\r\ns possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Please ignore this Fool if the post did not make much s=\r\nense.\n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; \n&gt; HavanOtpal\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That was=C3=82=C2=A0a nice post Aj=\r\nit. I am also one of those people who, because of guilt factor of skipping =\r\nsandhyavandana, unable to do the homa daily. I do it every week. But there =\r\nis a little other logistics issue for me. I live in the US and I do my homa=\r\n in my living room where the Wood burning Fireplace (east facing)=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0is located. My pooja room however, is in a different location towards no=\r\nrth of the house. I have a big Shiva Lingam in my pooja room for which I do=\r\n daily abhishekam in the morning, (with Rudra Adhyaya on Mondays). So, if I=\r\n have do both nithyapooja and homam daily, it is really time taking as arra=\r\nnging for homam takes almost 20 minutes, on a routine basis. Any ideas for =\r\nmanaging this better? For instance, arrangements include, \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; 1. cleaning up the previous homam residues, \n&gt; &gt; 2. putting new alumin=\r\nium foil in the homa kunda and below the homakunda, \n&gt; &gt; 3. putting alumini=\r\num foils before the homa kunda where I keep the ghee so that any spills wou=\r\nld happen on the foil, \n&gt; &gt; 4.cleaning the Kalasa, putting chandan and kumk=\r\num for kalas, putting askshatas pouring water, putting a flower in the kala=\r\nsa.\n&gt; &gt; 5. preparing an oil lamp\n&gt; &gt; 6. putting darbhas around the homa kun=\r\nda\n&gt; &gt; 7. putting starter wood block in the homa kunda along with camphor a=\r\nnd darbhas\n&gt; &gt; 8. melting the gree \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; All these take fro=\r\nm 15-20 minutes. If I have time, I do have a ninth step of cooking some foo=\r\nd for mahanaivedyam which takes an additional 20-30 minutes. With all these=\r\n, doing a homam and regular pooja in=C3=82=C2=A0a different place is really=\r\n difficult on a daily basis. But I want to do that. Any ideas for keeping i=\r\nt simple? \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Nagraj=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Sun, 6/2=\r\n6/11, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Ajit Krishn=\r\nan &lt;ajit.krishnan@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Homa kunda : Iron or co=\r\npper, other questions..\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Sund=\r\nay, June 26, 2011, 12:06 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nnamaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lastly, I did not find any homam manual that goes along=\r\n with sandhya vandanam ! Someone I respect, mentioned of AupAsana homam ...=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the past, I have asked exactly the same question.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If =\r\nyou are not already doing sandhyAvandana and aupAsana (and are\n&gt; &gt; doing ho=\r\nma), don&#39;t worry about it. Just skip this mail altogether. If\n&gt; &gt; you are d=\r\noing sandhyAvandana, don&#39;t want to stop doing it (because of\n&gt; &gt; the guilt =\r\nfactor), and want to better integrate it with homa, this\n&gt; &gt; mail may be of=\r\n some limited value. I have studied several\n&gt; &gt; sandhyAvandana, aupAsana an=\r\nd homa manuals.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Many traditions split sandhyAvandana into two part=\r\ns: (a) purificatory\n&gt; &gt; rites and (b) gAyatri-japa. If you want to integrat=\r\ne with homa, do\n&gt; &gt; homa between parts (a) and (b). The first part, with th=\r\ne mArjana etc\n&gt; &gt; hardly takes 1-2 minutes. After that, do the homa. After =\r\nthe purnahuti\n&gt; &gt; etc, you can do the second part of sandhyAvandana (gayatr=\r\ni japa)\n&gt; &gt; starting with the AvAhana. Spend as much time in this meditatio=\r\nn as\n&gt; &gt; you can. Then, you can do the upasthAna etc, which will add anothe=\r\nr 2\n&gt; &gt; minutes or so. Consider skipping all the elaborate nyAsas, and the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; repeated prAnAyAmas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Really speaking, everything important is =\r\nalready there in the homa\n&gt; &gt; manual. From the &quot;full sandhyAvandana&quot; proced=\r\nure, you can pull in a\n&gt; &gt; few veda mantras if you choose to. But, it reall=\r\ny isn&#39;t necessary.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you look at aupAsana procedures, you will fi=\r\nnd that Narasimha&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; manual is more elaborate than the aupAsana. Homa is=\r\n basically a\n&gt; &gt; superset of aupAsana. Where the manual differs, it is more=\r\n relevant\n&gt; &gt; for our modern lifestyle, and you don&#39;t need to add anything =\r\nto it.\n&gt; &gt; Frankly, I basically follow Narasimha&#39;s manual, but say &quot;aupAsan=\r\na&quot; in\n&gt; &gt; the sankalpa. They are that similar. The fire in which you do\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;upAsana&quot; is &quot;aupAsana&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ajit\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\r\n--0-780106026-1309242165=:62811\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot; id=3D=\r\nyiv965499788&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff; FONT-FAMILY: arial, hel=\r\nvetica, sans-serif; COLOR: #000; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: aut=\r\no&quot; id=3Dyiv965499788yui_3_2_0_2_130920898408443&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;=\r\n id=3Dyiv965499788yui_3_2_0_2_130920898408495&gt;Namaste,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot; id=3Dyiv965499788yui_3_2_0_=\r\n2_1309208984084118&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot;&gt;Copper kunda is available online at&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;RIGHT: auto&quot; id=3Dyiv965499788yui_3_2_0_2_1309208984084776&gt;&lt;SPAN id=\r\n=3Dyiv965499788yui_3_2_0_2_1309208984084303&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dy=\r\niv965499788yui_3_2_0_2_1309208984084308&gt;&lt;SPAN id=3Dyiv965499788yui_3_2_0_2_=\r\n1309208984084305&gt;http://www.rudraksha-ratna.com/&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN id=\r\n=3Dyiv965499788yui_3_2_0_2_1309208984084344&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN =\r\nid=3Dyiv965499788yui_3_2_0_2_1309208984084347&gt;Thanks,&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SP=\r\nAN id=3Dyiv965499788yui_3_2_0_2_1309208984084371&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nSPAN id=3Dyiv965499788yui_3_2_0_2_1309208984084374&gt;Priya&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR id=3Dyiv965499788yui_3_2_0_2_13092089840=\r\n8445&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; FONT-S=\r\nIZE: 12pt&quot; id=3Dyiv965499788yui_3_2_0_2_130920898408447 class=3Dyiv96549978=\r\n8ms__id633&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, se=\r\nrif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot; id=3Dyiv965499788yui_3_2_0_2_1309208984084397 class=\r\n=3Dyiv965499788ms__id636&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DArial&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BORDER-=\r\nBOTTOM: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; L=\r\nINE-HEIGHT: 0; MARGIN: 5px 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; FONT=\r\n-SIZE: 0px; BORDER-TOP: #ccc 1px solid; BORDER-RIGHT: #ccc 1px solid; PADDI=\r\nNG-TOP: 0px&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv965499788hr yiv965499788yui-non yiv965499788yui-sk=\r\nip&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vsra_prasad=\r\n &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;=\r\n/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: b=\r\nold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Sunday, June 26, 2011 9:43 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FO=\r\nNT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Re: Saving Preperation =\r\ntime: Homa kunda : Iron or copper, other questions..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=\r\n=3Dyiv965499788&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv96=\r\n5499788ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv965499788yui_3_2_0_2_1309208984084388&gt;For th=\r\ne last 3 days I have been doing the same, never used aluminium foil and am =\r\nnot planning to use also.

I use good amount of=\r\n ghee and I am not sure if that much is needed as most of it simply flows d=\r\nown.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lastly, I tried in some shops yes&#39;day and everyone is selling i=\r\nron homa kundam only and they reply back that copper is not used !!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nThanks Ajit for your responses again.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks VPathak.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;regards=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;rAma&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&g=\r\nt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Nagraj ji and other friends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; [&gt;\n =C3=82 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 1. cleaning up the previous homam residues=\r\n, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. putting new aluminium foil in the homa kunda and below t=\r\nhe homakunda, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3. putting aluminium foils before the homa kund=\r\na where I keep the ghee so that any spills would happen on the foil, &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; 4.cleaning the Kalasa, putting chandan and kumkum for kalas, puttin=\r\ng askshatas pouring water, putting a flower in the kalasa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 5. =\r\npreparing an oil lamp&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 6. putting darbhas around the homa kunda=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 7. putting starter wood block in the homa kunda along with ca=\r\nmphor and darbhas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 8. melting the gree &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; ]&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The issue of &quot;Arrangement&quot; for a Homa is almost fo=\r\nr everybody and i have also gone trough it for quite sometime. I would like=\r\n to suggest from my own method which may help you bring down 20 minutes to =\r\n10Min.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) First of all, It is advisable to avoid Aluminum =\r\nFoil.\n Aluminum foil cutting for correct size and then adjusting on Homa ku=\r\nndam takes a good amount of time. I did it for some 6 months initially and =\r\nthen there was a Message from Narasimha that it is better to avoid Aluminum=\r\n foil because Aluminum being a relatively modern metal and may carry Rahu&#39;s=\r\n predominance. I stopped foil since then...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) No need to =\r\nwash Homa Kundam every day. I do it once in a month or so. Let it be black =\r\nand dark.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If the above 2 points are observed, it can save =\r\nsome 5 to 7 minutes easily.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now, one can do following arra=\r\nngements previous nights (the people who do Homa in the morning)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; -Empty the Homa Kundam and keep it clean (Tissue papers are very han=\r\ndy for this) and ready for next morning&lt;BR&gt;&gt; - Keep the Dry Coconut piec=\r\nes or Wood ready.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; - Keep the Lamp ready with Wick&lt;BR&gt;&gt; - Keep Ca=\r\nmphor, Rice mixed with ghee and turmeric, Flowers, etc... ready. (I do not\n=\r\n use flowers any more. Use Akshatas mixed with Turmeric as flowers..Bhagwan=\r\n ko bolta hun BhavnaO ko Samjho! Phul ki jagape Chawal se kaam chalalo:-)&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; So when I get ready for Homam, I just have to fill up the c=\r\nopper tumbler with water and heat up the ghee and few other such activities=\r\n which takes around 5to7 Minutes in total.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Before i forget=\r\n i must remind that there is no need to keep the Darbha in 4 directions eve=\r\nry time. One can keep those Darbhas at the same place as many days as possi=\r\nble.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Please ignore this Fool if the post did not =\r\nmake much sense.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yours,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; HavanOtpal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; That was=C3=82&nbsp;a nice post Ajit. I am also one o=\r\nf\n those people who, because of guilt factor of skipping sandhyavandana, un=\r\nable to do the homa daily. I do it every week. But there is a little other =\r\nlogistics issue for me. I live in the US and I do my homa in my living room=\r\n where the Wood burning Fireplace (east facing)=C3=82&nbsp;is located. My p=\r\nooja room however, is in a different location towards north of the house. I=\r\n have a big Shiva Lingam in my pooja room for which I do daily abhishekam i=\r\nn the morning, (with Rudra Adhyaya on Mondays). So, if I have do both nithy=\r\napooja and homam daily, it is really time taking as arranging for homam tak=\r\nes almost 20 minutes, on a routine basis. Any ideas for managing this bette=\r\nr? For instance, arrangements include, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; 1. cleaning up the previous homam residues, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. putting ne=\r\nw aluminium foil in the homa kunda and below the homakunda, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3=\r\n. putting aluminium foils before the homa kunda where I keep the ghee so th=\r\nat\n any spills would happen on the foil, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 4.cleaning the Kalas=\r\na, putting chandan and kumkum for kalas, putting askshatas pouring water, p=\r\nutting a flower in the kalasa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 5. preparing an oil lamp&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; 6. putting darbhas around the homa kunda&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 7. putting sta=\r\nrter wood block in the homa kunda along with camphor and darbhas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; 8. melting the gree &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; All these ta=\r\nke from 15-20 minutes. If I have time, I do have a ninth step of cooking so=\r\nme food for mahanaivedyam which takes an additional 20-30 minutes. With all=\r\n these, doing a homam and regular pooja in=C3=82&nbsp;a different place is =\r\nreally difficult on a daily basis. But I want to do that. Any ideas for kee=\r\nping it simple? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nagraj=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Sun, 6/26/11, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.kris=\r\nhnan@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From: Ajit Krishn=\r\nan\n &lt;ajit.krishnan@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Homa ku=\r\nnda : Iron or copper, other questions..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:=\r\nvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;m=\r\nailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Date: Sunday, June 26, 2011, 12:06 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Lastly, I did not find any =\r\nhomam manual that goes along with sandhya vandanam ! Someone I respect, men=\r\ntioned of AupAsana homam ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In the past, I have=\r\n asked exactly the same question.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If you are not=\r\n already doing sandhyAvandana and aupAsana (and are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; doing homa=\r\n), don&#39;t worry about it. Just skip this mail altogether. If&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; yo=\r\nu are doing sandhyAvandana, don&#39;t want to stop doing it (because of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n the guilt factor), and want to better integrate it with homa, this&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; mail may be of some limited value. I have studied several&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; sandhyAvandana, aupAsana and homa manuals.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Many traditions split sandhyAvandana into two parts: (a) purificatory&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rites and (b) gAyatri-japa. If you want to integrate with homa, =\r\ndo&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; homa between parts (a) and (b). The first part, with the mA=\r\nrjana etc&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; hardly takes 1-2 minutes. After that, do the homa. A=\r\nfter the purnahuti&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; etc, you can do the second part of sandhyAv=\r\nandana (gayatri japa)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; starting with the AvAhana. Spend as much=\r\n time in this meditation as&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; you can. Then, you can do the upas=\r\nthAna etc, which will add another 2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; minutes or so. Consider sk=\r\nipping all the elaborate nyAsas, and the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; repeated prAnAyAmas.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Really speaking, everything important is\n alread=\r\ny there in the homa&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; manual. From the &quot;full sandhyAvandana&quot; pro=\r\ncedure, you can pull in a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; few veda mantras if you choose to. B=\r\nut, it really isn&#39;t necessary.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If you look at au=\r\npAsana procedures, you will find that Narasimha&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; manual is mo=\r\nre elaborate than the aupAsana. Homa is basically a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; superset o=\r\nf aupAsana. Where the manual differs, it is more relevant&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; for =\r\nour modern lifestyle, and you don&#39;t need to add anything to it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; Frankly, I basically follow Narasimha&#39;s manual, but say &quot;aupAsana&quot; in&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; the sankalpa. They are that similar. The fire in which you do&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &quot;upAsana&quot; is &quot;aupAsana&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; bhavadiiyaH,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ajit&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-780106026-1309242165=:62811--\r\n\n"}}
