But the roles are not static=\r\n. They are dynamic and may undergo fine-tuning or modification or evolution=\r\n from time to time (and life to life) based on how we play our allotted rol=\r\nes. \n \nThe role you are given is your destiny and how you play it is your f=\r\nree will. How you play your role now (free will) influences what role you a=\r\nre given in future (destiny).\n \nIf the role given to you (e.g. Arjuna) is t=\r\no kill your guru (Drona) and relatives, you cannot escape it. But you can e=\r\nither do it with a hateful mind or a guilty mind or you can do it with a ca=\r\nlm mind. If the role given to you (e.g. Janaka) is to rule a big kingdom, y=\r\nou cannot escape and do penances in a forest. But you can either rule the k=\r\ningdom with a proud and attached mind or with a calm mind. If the role give=\r\nn to you (e.g. Swami Samarth Ramadas) is to guide a mighty king (Shivaji) i=\r\nn resisting the invading muslim kings, you cannot escape it. But you can ei=\r\nther do it with an attached and agitated mind or a calm mind.\n \nPeople in t=\r\nhe examples I mentioned above engaged in what may seem like material action=\r\ns, but they did them after overcoming attachments and with an equanimous mi=\r\nnd.\n \nAs I keep saying, what you do is a secondary factor and how you do it=\r\n is primary. Even as we engage in actions that we believe to be our dharma,=\r\n we should work on our attitude and increase surrender. When one has surren=\r\ndered to god and is able to look at pleasure and pain, praise and censure i=\r\nn the same way, then one&#39;s dharma will be far clearer to one. One whose min=\r\nd is densely conditioned by duality and desires will see one&#39;s dharma throu=\r\ngh the coloring of that conditioning and may misjudge. On the other hand, o=\r\nne with a clear mind with very little conditioning will see one&#39;s dharma cl=\r\nearer.\n \nIn simpler words, one who heavily identifies with the body and wan=\r\nts comforts and pleasures of the body will see one&#39;s dharma from that motiv=\r\nation. One may identify with body, with a group of people, with a deity etc=\r\n. As is the identification, so is the conditioning and so is one&#39;s vision o=\r\nf one&#39;s dharma.\n \nThough everyone is playing their allotted role, some have=\r\n densely conditioned minds and unable to see their dharma clearly and pursu=\r\ning adharma. As a result, they may continue to be allotted roles where dens=\r\nely conditioned minds restrict their actions, in future.\n \nSome have very c=\r\nlear minds and able to see their dharma clearly and pursuing higher dharma.=\r\n As a result, they may continue to allotted roles where lighter and lighter=\r\n mental conditioning restricts them and eventually they become free.\n \nOne =\r\ncan try to use free will to move from the former case to the latter case.\n =\r\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Wr=\r\nitings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=\r\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a dif=\r\nference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyo=\r\ntishWritings\n--------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n \n---- Raj Nambisan &lt;rajnambisan@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\ni have a question: if everyone is playing the allotted role, as the peerles=\r\ns maharshi alludes to, then what&#39;s the point in our debating these things? =\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t the thesis apply to osama, nehru, gandhiji equally -- that =\r\nis, each one is/was playing the exact role he is/was supposed to, right or =\r\nwrong?\n&gt;  \n&gt; which begs the question, when does free will begin and fate en=\r\nd?\n&gt;  \n&gt; enlightenment, please..\n&gt;  \n&gt; regards,\n&gt;  \n&gt; raj\n \n---- rajarshi n=\r\nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear KK,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Great question!\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Also, I personally do not agree that a saint cannot interfere in the poli=\r\ntical situation of a country. Dharma depends on the desh-kaal-patra. Swami =\r\nRamdas - an amsa of Hanuman - inspired Shivaji Maharaj to fight against the=\r\n Moghuls. Had it not been so, today Kashi would have remained Muhammadabad =\r\nand Mathura and Prayag would have become Mecca and Medina.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However at=\r\n the same time I am sure there were probably other self-realized saints in =\r\nIndia who never bothered themselves with the political situation of the lan=\r\nd. \n&gt;  \n&gt; So everyone to his/her path.
