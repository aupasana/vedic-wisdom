The 3 steps taken by Sri Vishnu after Bali allowed for the=\r\nm also\n          signify how the lord will dissolve the maya and takes cont=\r\nrol of our\n          bodies and life. With the first step the lord took con=\r\ntrol over the\n          Bhuva Loka (association with body and material aspe=\r\ncts) and with the\n          second step he took control over the higher lok=\r\nas (indriyas) and finally\n          the last step was left and only place l=\r\neft was Balis head (ahamkara)\n          which was dissolved as well.\n\n     =\r\n     If you allow God to be part of your life then he will work in mystical=\r\n\n          ways and take care of the illusion of your body, senses, and fin=\r\nally\n          your ego\n\n          2. The story cannot be complete without =\r\nthe role played by Shukracharya\n          or the guru of the Asuras. He kne=\r\nw that Sri Vamana was no other than\n          Sri Vishnu and warned Bali bu=\r\nt the latter out of pride and duty still\n          gave his word (there was=\r\n still some goodness in Bali, maybe a small\n          piece). To seal the d=\r\neal water was to be put out of the kamandalu of\n          Sri Vamana onto t=\r\nhe hands of Bali. Shukracharya shrinks to a small size\n          and tries =\r\nto block the flow of water from the Kamandalu and Sri Vamana\n          take=\r\ns a straw and clears the way and Shukracharya loses an eye. The\n          g=\r\nuru of the Asuras becomes half blind (opposed to Brihaspati).\n\n          As=\r\n the devata tries to enter the body of a devotee, the Rajas element\n       =\r\n   will play all kinds of tricks and block the path. A straw\n          (rep=\r\nresenting qualities of Surya or the scriptures) accompanied by an\n         =\r\n able Guru (Sri Vamana) can clear the path.\n\n          Regards\n\n          V=\r\neenu\n\n          --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Prasanth Jalasutram\n=\r\n          &lt;jvrsprasanth@ ...&gt; wrote:\n          &gt;\n          &gt; [image: [vishn=\r\nu_avatar_ QJ96_l.jpg] ]\n          &gt;\n          &lt;http://2.bp. blogspot. com/_=\r\nS49ZRy14b1M /Ssv69e578aI/ AAAAAAAAAXA/ pwpQ5i4KI&#92;\n          50/s1600-h/vish=\r\nnu_ avatar_QJ96_ l.jpg&gt;\n          &gt; *SRI VAMANA AVATHARA*\n          &gt; **\n  =\r\n        &gt; **\n          &gt;\n          &gt; *Significance\n          &gt; *\n          =\r\n&gt;\n          &gt; *Sri Vamana Avathara was fifth in the line of Dasavatharas of=\r\n Lord Sri\n          Maha\n          &gt; Vishnu. This avathara took place durin=\r\ng Treta Yuga before Sri\n          Parashurama\n          &gt; Avathara. Lord Ma=\r\nha Vishnu took this avathara in order to suppress the\n          &gt; arrogance=\r\n, vanity and pride of Emperor Bali (Bali Chakravarthi) and to\n          &gt; r=\r\nestore the glory, power and authority of Lord Indra over the Heaven\n       =\r\n   who had\n          &gt; lost his power and kingdom (Swarga) to King Bali.

He was known as Trivik=\r\nrama because he is the one who\n          has\n          &gt; conquered the thre=\r\ne worlds, Earth, Upper worlds and Nether worlds. He\n          grew\n        =\r\n  &gt; to a gigantic size while suppressing the King Bali and conquered the\n  =\r\n        &gt; Universe with just three paces of his foot. He was also referred =\r\nas\n          Upendra\n          &gt; as he was known to be the younger brother =\r\nof Indra. We find all the\n          three\n          &gt; names Trivikrama, Vam=\r\nana and Upendra while reciting 24 Kesava Namas.\n          An\n          &gt; ex=\r\nclusive Purana named after Lord Vamana called Sri Vamana Purana\n          s=\r\ncripted\n          &gt; by Lord and Sage Veda Vyasa forms part of 18 great Pura=\r\nnas called\n          Ashtadasa\n          &gt; Puranas.*\n          &gt;\n          =\r\n&gt; *Lord Vamana was born as the son of Sage Kashyapa (Kashyapa\n          Pra=\r\njapathi) and\n          &gt; his wife Aditi in accordance to the penance done b=\r\ny the couple and\n          prayers\n          &gt; of Indra and other Deities. =\r\nHe was born on Bhadrapada Sukla Dwadasi\n          day\n          &gt; under the=\r\n star constellation of Sravana Nakshatra. This day every year\n          is\n=\r\n          &gt; celebrated as Vamana Jayanthi the day on which Lord Sri Vamana =\r\nwas\n          born. As\n          &gt; soon as he was born He took no time in a=\r\nttaining the boyhood becoming\n          a Vatu\n          &gt; (Brahmachari) . =\r\nLord Brahma himself initiated the Gayathri Manthra to\n          Sri\n       =\r\n   &gt; Vamana. His attire was that of a typical Brahmin Brahmachari, wearing\n=\r\n          a\n          &gt; Koupeena (Loin cloth), a sacred thread, holding a C=\r\nhatthra (Umbrella)\n          in one\n          &gt; hand and Dhanda/Kamandalu (=\r\nstick and water jug) in the other, his\n          upper body\n          &gt; cov=\r\nered with Deer skin, wearing a ring of Dharbha (Kusa grass) to his\n        =\r\n  third\n          &gt; finger.*\n          &gt; **\n          &gt;\n          &gt; *Signif=\r\nicance of Three Steps*\n          &gt; *Lord Vamana went to King Maha Bali and =\r\nasks for three steps of land\n          &gt; measured by his foot as charity. I=\r\nnitially Bali hesitated to donate\n          just\n          &gt; three paces of=\r\n land as it is a disgrace to his status and was guilty\n          to give\n  =\r\n        &gt; such charity. But later agreed, upon insisting by Lord Vamana and=\r\n\n          promised\n          &gt; to give three paces of land as charity meas=\r\nured by Sri Vamana&#39;s\n          foot. When\n          &gt; Maha Bali completed t=\r\nhe ritual process of donating the land, Lord\n          Vamana\n          &gt; a=\r\nssumed his cosmic form (Trivikrama) , measured the entire Earth\n          i=\r\nncluding\n          &gt; the nether worlds by his first step.*\n          &gt; *\n  =\r\n        &gt; With his second step He measured the entire upper worlds. When hi=\r\ns\n          foot\n          &gt; reached the zenith it crossed the Sathya Loka =\r\nwhere Lord Brahma stays.\n          &gt; Seeing the foot of Lord Maha Vishnu, L=\r\nord Brahma offered abhishekam\n          and\n          &gt; washed the Lord&#39;s f=\r\noot and the water that fell from His foot\n          sanctified the\n        =\r\n  &gt; entire Universe. We find in the verses of great composer and Saint Sri\n=\r\n          &gt; Annamacharya referring to the foot washed by Lord Brahma (Brahm=\r\na\n          Kadigina\n          &gt; Padamu) in one of his verses on Lord Sri V=\r\nenkateswara. *\n          &gt; *\n          &gt; When the entire Universe was conqu=\r\nered by just two paces of Lord Sri\n          Maha\n          &gt; Vishnu (Vaman=\r\na) there was no space left in the Universe to keep\n          Vamana&#39;s\n     =\r\n     &gt; third pace. When Lord Vamana asked Maha Bali the space to keep his\n =\r\n         third\n          &gt; pace, all the pride and vanity of Maha Bali had =\r\nvanished and he had no\n          &gt; hesitation in surrendering before the Su=\r\npreme Lord. Having realised\n          the\n          &gt; Supreme Reality, Bali=\r\n readily offered his own head to keep the\n          Lord&#39;s third\n          =\r\n&gt; step. Lord Vamana immediately placed his third pace (his foot) on the\n   =\r\n       head\n          &gt; of Bali and sent him to the nether worlds. Thus the=\r\n ahankara (egoism)\n          of\n          &gt; Maha Bali was suppressed and In=\r\ndra was restored with his kingdom.*\n          &gt; **\n          &gt;\n          &gt; =\r\n*Uniqueness*\n          &gt;\n          &gt; *Sri Vamana Avathara is the first Avat=\r\nhara where Lord Sri Maha Vishnu\n          took\n          &gt; complete human f=\r\norm though dwarf at the beginning. The uniqueness of\n          this\n       =\r\n   &gt; Avathara is that the Lord did not use any weapon. The only weapon he\n =\r\n         used\n          &gt; was that of begging in front of King Bali in acco=\r\nrdance to the\n          Brahmanic\n          &gt; (Brahmachari) form he had att=\r\nained. The Lord did not kill the King\n          Bali even\n          &gt; thoug=\r\nh he was an Asura. He conquered him in a Vedic way with his\n          &gt; int=\r\nelligence. Unlike other Avatharas, Vamana Avathara was a Sattvik\n          =\r\n&gt; Avathara. Lord had to resort to this strategy due to the promise he\n     =\r\n     had made\n          &gt; to his beloved devotee Prahlada not to kill any o=\r\nf his descendants.\n          &gt; Astrologically Jupiter (Guru) is said to be =\r\nthe Paramatma Amsa of\n          Vamana\n          &gt; Avathara.*\n          &gt; *=\r\n*\n          &gt; *Message from Vamana Avathara\n          &gt; *\n          &gt;\n     =\r\n     &gt; *Hidden behind every Avathara of Paramatma there is a message/moral\n=\r\n          &gt; conveyed. In this Sri Vamana Avathara the message is total surr=\r\nender\n          to the\n          &gt; God however mighty one may be. When once=\r\n you shed your ego and\n          surrender\n          &gt; totally with devotio=\r\nn at the feet of the supreme Lord there is nothing\n          one\n          =\r\n&gt; can worry about and will get total protection. This is what exactly\n     =\r\n     has\n          &gt; happened in case of Bali who had no other alternative =\r\nbut to surrender\n          to\n          &gt; the Lord Trivikrama who had conqu=\r\nered the three worlds.*\n          &gt; *When King Bali surrendered in front of=\r\n Lord Vamana with total\n          devotion, the\n          &gt; Lord was very m=\r\nuch pleased and gave him boons voluntarily without\n          being\n        =\r\n  &gt; asked by King Bali. He not only made him the ruler of the nether world\n=\r\n          &gt; Suthala but also assured him that He would always protect his k=\r\ningdom.\n          He\n          &gt; also assured Bali that he would become the=\r\n Indra in the next\n          Manvanthara. By\n          &gt; the touch of Lord&#39;=\r\ns foot on the head of King Bali all his sins got\n          cleaned\n        =\r\n  &gt; up, he became immortal (Chiranjeevi) . This is what one should\n        =\r\n  understand\n          &gt; that we should never ask for alms to the Supreme L=\r\nord. If you ask you\n          will\n          &gt; get only what you had asked.=\r\n It you don&#39;t ask you will get\n          everything that\n          &gt; you re=\r\nquire.*\n          &gt; *\n          &gt; The story of Bali also bring out the real=\r\nity that, there is nothing\n          &gt; permanent and nothing to be taken fo=\r\nr granted in this world be it\n          wealth,\n          &gt; beauty, power, =\r\nstatus, position or family and nothing belongs to\n          anyone.\n       =\r\n   &gt; Even the mighty have to fall on one day or the other.

With the first step the lord took \n          =\r\ncontrol over the&lt;BR&gt;Bhuva Loka (association with body and material \n       =\r\n   aspects) and with the&lt;BR&gt;second step he took control over the higher \n  =\r\n        lokas (indriyas) and finally&lt;BR&gt;the last step was left and only pla=\r\nce \n          left was Balis head (ahamkara)&lt;BR&gt;which was dissolved as \n   =\r\n       well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you allow God to be part of your life then he will \n=\r\n          work in mystical&lt;BR&gt;ways and take care of the illusion of your bo=\r\ndy, \n          senses, and finally&lt;BR&gt;your ego&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. The story cannot b=\r\ne complete \n          without the role played by Shukracharya&lt;BR&gt;or the gur=\r\nu of the Asuras. \n          He knew that Sri Vamana was no other than&lt;BR&gt;Sr=\r\ni Vishnu and warned \n          Bali but the latter out of pride and duty st=\r\nill&lt;BR&gt;gave his word \n          (there was still some goodness in Bali, may=\r\nbe a small&lt;BR&gt;piece). To \n          seal the deal water was to be put out o=\r\nf the kamandalu of&lt;BR&gt;Sri \n          Vamana onto the hands of Bali. Shukrac=\r\nharya shrinks to a small \n          size&lt;BR&gt;and tries to block the flow of =\r\nwater from the Kamandalu and \n          Sri Vamana&lt;BR&gt;takes a straw and cle=\r\nars the way and Shukracharya loses \n          an eye. The&lt;BR&gt;guru of the As=\r\nuras becomes half blind (opposed to \n          Brihaspati).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As the d=\r\nevata tries to enter the body of a \n          devotee, the Rajas element&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;will play all kinds of tricks and block \n          the path. A straw&lt;BR&gt;(r=\r\nepresenting qualities of Surya or the \n          scriptures) accompanied by=\r\n an&lt;BR&gt;able Guru (Sri Vamana) can clear the \n          path.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Veenu&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo=\r\n.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; \n          target=3D_b=\r\nlank rel=3Dnofollow \n          ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ \n          yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, Prasanth Jalasutram&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;jvrsprasanth@ ...&gt; \n          wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; [image: [vishn=\r\nu_avatar_ QJ96_l.jpg] \n          ]&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;&lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://2.bp.blogspot.com/_S49ZRy14b1M/Ssv69e578aI/AAAAAAAAAXA/pwpQ5i4KI50/s160=\r\n0-h/vishnu_avatar_QJ96_l.jpg&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;htt=\r\np://2.bp. blogspot. com/_S49ZRy14b1M \n          /Ssv69e578aI/ AAAAAAAAAXA/ =\r\npwpQ5i4KI&#92;&lt;BR&gt;50/s1600-h/vishnu_ \n          avatar_QJ96_ l.jpg&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; *SRI VAMANA AVATHARA*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          **&lt;BR&gt;&gt; **&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n*Significance&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          *Sri Vamana Avathara was=\r\n fifth in the line of Dasavatharas of Lord \n          Sri&lt;BR&gt;Maha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; V=\r\nishnu.

When&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Maha Bali completed the =\r\n\n          ritual process of donating the land, Lord&lt;BR&gt;Vamana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; assu=\r\nmed \n          his cosmic form (Trivikrama) , measured the entire \n        =\r\n  Earth&lt;BR&gt;including&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the nether worlds by his first \n          step=\r\n.*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; With his second step He measured the entire \n         =\r\n upper worlds. When his&lt;BR&gt;foot&lt;BR&gt;&gt; reached the zenith it crossed \n    =\r\n      the Sathya Loka where Lord Brahma stays.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Seeing the foot of \n=\r\n          Lord Maha Vishnu, Lord Brahma offered abhishekam&lt;BR&gt;and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; w=\r\nashed \n          the Lord&#39;s foot and the water that fell from His foot&lt;BR&gt;s=\r\nanctified \n          the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; entire Universe. We find in the verses of =\r\ngreat composer \n          and Saint Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Annamacharya referring to t=\r\nhe foot washed by \n          Lord Brahma (Brahma&lt;BR&gt;Kadigina&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Padamu=\r\n) in one of his verses \n          on Lord Sri Venkateswara. *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; When the entire Universe \n          was conquered by just two paces of=\r\n Lord Sri&lt;BR&gt;Maha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Vishnu \n          (Vamana) there was no space lef=\r\nt in the Universe to \n          keep&lt;BR&gt;Vamana&#39;s&lt;BR&gt;&gt; third pace. When L=\r\nord Vamana asked Maha Bali \n          the space to keep his&lt;BR&gt;third&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; pace, all the pride and vanity \n          of Maha Bali had vanished and h=\r\ne had no&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hesitation in \n          surrendering before the Supreme L=\r\nord. Having realised&lt;BR&gt;the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Supreme Reality, Bali readil=\r\ny offered his own head to keep \n          the&lt;BR&gt;Lord&#39;s third&lt;BR&gt;&gt; step.=\r\n Lord Vamana immediately placed his \n          third pace (his foot) on the=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;head&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of Bali and sent him to \n          the nether worlds. Thus=\r\n the ahankara (egoism)&lt;BR&gt;of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Maha Bali \n          was suppressed an=\r\nd Indra was restored with his kingdom.*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          **&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; *Uniqueness*&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *Sri Vamana Avathara \n          is the firs=\r\nt Avathara where Lord Sri Maha Vishnu&lt;BR&gt;took&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          complete h=\r\numan form though dwarf at the beginning. The uniqueness \n          of&lt;BR&gt;th=\r\nis&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Avathara is that the Lord did not use any weapon. \n          The=\r\n only weapon he&lt;BR&gt;used&lt;BR&gt;&gt; was that of begging in front of \n          =\r\nKing Bali in accordance to the&lt;BR&gt;Brahmanic&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (Brahmachari) form \n   =\r\n       he had attained. The Lord did not kill the King&lt;BR&gt;Bali even&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n          though he was an Asura. He conquered him in a Vedic way with \n =\r\n         his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; intelligence. Unlike other Avatharas, Vamana Avathara =\r\nwas \n          a Sattvik&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Avathara. Lord had to resort to this strat=\r\negy due to \n          the promise he&lt;BR&gt;had made&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to his beloved dev=\r\notee Prahlada not \n          to kill any of his descendants.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Astrol=\r\nogically Jupiter (Guru) \n          is said to be the Paramatma Amsa of&lt;BR&gt;V=\r\namana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          Avathara.*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; **&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *Message from Vamana=\r\n Avathara&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *Hidden behind every Avathar=\r\na of Paramatma there is \n          a message/moral&lt;BR&gt;&gt; conveyed. In thi=\r\ns Sri Vamana Avathara the \n          message is total surrender&lt;BR&gt;to the&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; God however mighty one \n          may be. When once you shed your eg=\r\no and&lt;BR&gt;surrender&lt;BR&gt;&gt; totally \n          with devotion at the feet of =\r\nthe supreme Lord there is \n          nothing&lt;BR&gt;one&lt;BR&gt;&gt; can worry about=\r\n and will get total protection. \n          This is what exactly&lt;BR&gt;has&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; happened in case of Bali who had \n          no other alternative but to=\r\n surrender&lt;BR&gt;to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the Lord \n          Trivikrama who had conquered t=\r\nhe three worlds.*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *When King \n          Bali surrendered in front o=\r\nf Lord Vamana with total&lt;BR&gt;devotion, \n          the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Lord was very =\r\nmuch pleased and gave him boons voluntarily \n          without&lt;BR&gt;being&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; asked by King Bali. He not only made him the \n          ruler of the n=\r\nether world&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Suthala but also assured him that He \n          would a=\r\nlways protect his kingdom.&lt;BR&gt;He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; also assured Bali that \n          =\r\nhe would become the Indra in the next&lt;BR&gt;Manvanthara. By&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the \n     =\r\n     touch of Lord&#39;s foot on the head of King Bali all his sins \n          =\r\ngot&lt;BR&gt;cleaned&lt;BR&gt;&gt; up, he became immortal (Chiranjeevi) . This is \n    =\r\n      what one should&lt;BR&gt;understand&lt;BR&gt;&gt; that we should never ask for \n =\r\n         alms to the Supreme Lord. If you ask you&lt;BR&gt;will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; get only =\r\nwhat \n          you had asked. It you don&#39;t ask you will get&lt;BR&gt;everything =\r\n\n          that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; you require.*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; The story of Bali a=\r\nlso \n          bring out the reality that, there is nothing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; permane=\r\nnt and \n          nothing to be taken for granted in this world be it&lt;BR&gt;we=\r\nalth,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          beauty, power, status, position or family and noth=\r\ning belongs \n          to&lt;BR&gt;anyone.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Even the mighty have to fall o=\r\nn one day or the \n          other.
