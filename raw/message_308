Anyone who has ever tried =\r\neven a minutest fraction \nof \n&gt; sadhana not to gain a better happy life but=\r\n to get that one small \n&gt; fraction of an inch closer to God will know the m=\r\nillions of \ntroubles \n&gt; and frustation that come in the path. It was on one=\r\n such moment \nwhen \n&gt; I came across this writing and felt humbled. Ganapati=\r\n Muni was \nknown \n&gt; as a siddha who had done terrific, i repeat terrific am=\r\nount of \n&gt; penances, even before he met Sri Ramana Maharishi. If such a man=\r\n \n&gt; could be troubled by doubts and frustation, what to speak of us \n&gt; ordi=\r\nnary men whos minds are overcrowded with multiple weaknessess. \n&gt; Also the =\r\nfollowinf conversation shows how a real understanding of \n&gt; the shastra is =\r\npossible ONLY for a man who is that spiritually \n&gt; elevated. Like Lahiri Ma=\r\nhasaya used to say to his disciples, only a \n&gt; true yogi will understand th=\r\ne spriptures. Others will only get a \n&gt; incomplete surface view of things. =\r\nAnd based on our incomplete \n&gt; inefficient understand of shatras we keep fi=\r\nghting with others \n&gt; claiming our path our tradition our understading is t=\r\nhe only true \n&gt; one.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Ganapati Muni had met the yet-to-be-called Sri R=\r\namana on the \n&gt; southern slopes of Arunachala. One day he was assailed by p=\r\nains, \n&gt; troubles, doubts. He remembered that the young Swami was on the \n&gt;=\r\n hill, and at midday, a little after noon, he climbed and found him \n&gt; sitt=\r\ning outside Virupaksha cave, alone. He prostrated and \nsaid, &quot;All \n&gt; the sc=\r\nriptures that have to be read, I have read. All the mantras \n&gt; and japa tha=\r\nt have to be done, I have done. Still I have no peace. \n&gt; Please save me.&quot; =\r\nThe young Swami took a little time. For at least \n&gt; fifteen minutes he sile=\r\nntly gazed at him. Then in Tamil, he spoke. \n&gt; The English translation is s=\r\nimple:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;If one watches whence the notion &#39;I&#39; arises, the mind is absor=\r\nbed \n&gt; in That; that is tapas. When you recite a mantra, watch where the \n&gt;=\r\n sound is coming from, within you; when you sing a song or prayer, \n&gt; watch=\r\n where it is emanating from: your Heart. Put your attention on \n&gt; That. Tha=\r\nt is tyaga, that is TAPASYA, that is all.&quot; \n&gt; All his doubts and delusions =\r\nwere washed away that day. &quot;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
