Why not accept \nwhatever comes our way as &#39;PRASAD&#39; from Is=\r\nvara and move on.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nMy response: The final goal is indeed to reach a =\r\nstate of mind where one can accept the fruits of all karmas as prasad of Lo=\r\nrd, with an equanimous mind. However, it is not easy. When we receive the f=\r\nruits of some really terrible karmas, our mind gets so twisted and agitated=\r\n that we lose our balance and our judgment gets badly beated. This may resu=\r\nlt in further bad karmas being committed in that agitated/confused state.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nThus, it IS sometimes useful to push off some really bad impending k=\r\narmas when one is still in a position to do so. If one reaches a calmer sta=\r\nte of mind in that borrowed time, one may be able to handle the bad fruits =\r\nbetter. It is even possible theoretically that one pushes off a really bad =\r\nkarma, makes progress during that borrowed\n time, reaches an equanimous sta=\r\nte of mind, becomes liberated and then faces the karma as a liberated being=\r\n with a totally equanimous mind that does not get agitated.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nComment 2: Prarabda karma is which was already done and san=\r\nchitha and agami are what we going to do.\n=C2=A0\nMy Response: Actually sanc=\r\nhita karmas are also karmas already done. Sanchita means &quot;piled up&quot;. Prarab=\r\ndha karmas are different in the sense that their fructification has already=\r\n begun. The verb &quot;prArabh&quot; means &quot;to begin&quot;. Its noun form &quot;prArambha&quot; mean=\r\ns &quot;beginning&quot; and its gerund noun form &quot;prArabdha&quot; means &quot;the [one that was=\r\n] begun&quot;. Prarabdha karmas are actions for which the process of reaction ha=\r\ns already begun and in the pipeline. Whereas sanchita karmas are piled up k=\r\narmas that have not kicked off their fruits yet. They can be delayed indefi=\r\nnitely. If one becomes liberated while living, one can merge in Cosmic Self=\r\n without experiencing the fruits of sanchita karmas. However, fruits of pra=\r\nrabdha karmas are already in the pipeline and need to be experienced even b=\r\ny a liberated being.\n=C2=A0\nThough fruits of prarabdha karmas are already i=\r\nn the pipeline, even they can actually be delayed or manipulated. Bottomlin=\r\ne is that there are agents of delivery at the physical and subtle level eve=\r\nn for things deep in the pipeline and hence some limited adjustment is poss=\r\nible.\n\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nComment 3:How does nishkam karma works=\r\n? In other words, when a doer detaches himself from an action, where does t=\r\nhe reaction goes?\n=C2=A0\nMy Response: If one identifies with a body-mind co=\r\nmplex and a limited sense of self-identification and pursues its selfish ag=\r\nenda, one keeps accumulating karmas. But, if one has minimal identification=\r\n with a body-mind complex to just sustain it, pursues no agenda and engages=\r\n in whatever action is natural in the situation one is in (but not driven b=\r\ny any conditioning, i.e. agendas or desires or likes/dislikes), then one is=\r\n untouched by karmas performed in that state.\n=C2=A0\nIn the words of Swami =\r\nSivananda of Hrishikesh, &quot;The accumulated and current actions of a Jnani ta=\r\nke shelter in Brahmanda Prakriti&quot;. In other words, Sanchita karmas (piled u=\r\np actions from past that have not yet begun fructifying) and aagami karmas =\r\n(actions being performed right now) of a liberated being take shelted in\n C=\r\nosmic Kinetic Consciousness (Brahmanda Prakriti).\n\n=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nComment 4: If my destiny is to suffer, why should I pray to God? And=\r\n if i am being \npunished for some kind of bad karma from the past, why am i=\r\n not aware of it? It is like getting punishment without knowing your bad de=\r\neds.\n=C2=A0\nMy Response: One need not pray to God.All one needs to do is to=\r\n stop engaging in problematic karmas to add to the pile of such karmas from=\r\n the past. More importantly, one needs to reach a calm and sustainable stat=\r\ne of mind in which that can be maintained even in the middle of a tumultous=\r\n hurricane caused in one&#39;s life due to serious bad karmas from the past. On=\r\nce serious troubles set in or mind focuses on sense objects, material world=\r\n and one&#39;s pleasures and pains, mind tends to lose its balance and judgment=\r\n, starts pursuing its limited selfish agendas and starts performing even mo=\r\nre bad karmas. Thus, praying to God and contemplating various ideals and qu=\r\nalities that God represents can give a shelter to the mind in which it can =\r\nmaintain some calmness, balance and judgment. If that is not the case for o=\r\nne, perhaps one needs to perfect it further.\n=C2=A0\nGod has no agenda to ei=\r\nther punish you or hide the reason. God is an impartial balancer of reactio=\r\nns to all actions. If there is something unreasonable about the reaction yo=\r\nu are getting, it means your action had a similar unreasonableness.\n\n=C2=A0=\r\nLet me turn around your question on being &quot;aware&quot; and ask a simple question=\r\n. When we cause loss or hurt to someone, do we always tell that person why =\r\nwe are doing it? If not, how can we expect someone to tell us before causin=\r\ng loss or hurt to us? If I caused terrible strife to someone pious and pure=\r\n for no reason, then Nature will use someone in future to cause terrible st=\r\nrife to me despite my piety and purity and apparently for no reason.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nIn fact, what will you achieve by knowing exactly what was the action that=\r\n caused what is happening to you right now? Why is that useful? More useful=\r\n is your conscience (a representation of God in each heart) that tells you =\r\nright from wrong. It constantly gives guidance on which actions will give g=\r\nood reactions *in future*.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nComment 5: Vasana =\r\ncan be for wealth, fame, power, domination (a struggle for power!) etc. Man=\r\ny ripus, many reasons...!\n=C2=A0\nMy Response: Well-said. Though we are disc=\r\nussing karma and karma phala here, the root cause of karma is vasana in chi=\r\nttaakasha. (Chidaakaasha is the space of pure consciousness and chittaakaas=\r\nha is the space of conditioned consciousness that has likes, dislikes, desi=\r\nres, agendas etc.) Vasishtha defined liberation as overcoming vasanas in Yo=\r\nga Vaasishtham and Patanjali defined yoga as &quot;chitta vR^itti nirodhaH yogaH=\r\n&quot; (resisting the working of conditioning is oneness with Cosmic Self) in Yo=\r\nga Sutras. Until we overcome our vasanas, we are bound. Some are dense and =\r\nsome are very subtle. But all of them bind us.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nComment 6:1. As per Shri Vimalananda, you may also offer all the karmas=\r\n as Homa to inner \ndevas or ishta devta? He mentioned that there is lesser =\r\nof suffering if \nyou do that. Who gets the remaining delta suffering?\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nMy Response: Karmaphala for a specific karma is not a function of that =\r\nkarma alone. It is a function of that karma and one&#39;s current state of mind=\r\n. If someone serves spoiled food, one may get an upset stomach for half day=\r\n or diaria for a week. It depends on how strong one is. Similarly, the same=\r\n karmaphala set in motion by the same external agents of delivery (physical=\r\n & subtle) can cause different reaction inside one, depending on one&#39;s curr=\r\nent state of mind.\n=C2=A0\nAn idle mind is devil&#39;s workshop. Our minds keep =\r\nvibrating with various notions and thoughts. A mind vibrating with selfish =\r\ndesires and unnecessary clutter/confusion *amplifies* the negative effects =\r\nof one&#39;s environment (through which fruits of karmas are\n administered).\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nIf one thinks of ishta devata with reverence and contemplates variou=\r\ns ideals and qualities of ishta devata and mind vibrates with saattwik ener=\r\ngy, it absorbs the negative effects of one&#39;s environment better or at least=\r\n does not amplify them.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology &=\r\n Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n=\r\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

Shakti is the sum total of all the =\r\nbeings with various agendas engaging in various karmas and experiencing var=\r\nious karmaphalas. Purusha is the witness of it all.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Though each ka=\r\nrma should give karmaphala that is commensurate with it, that requires an *=\r\nagent* to deliver the karmaphala, i.e. another being. So this requires a co=\r\nmplicated balancing act on part of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness =\r\n(i.e. Shakti). There are very complicated rules that decide the *sequencing=\r\n* of karmaphalas and picking of agents for their delivery.\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;At an=\r\ny time, some karmas from one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;must experience karmap=\r\nhala in this life&quot; pool, some karmas in a &quot;preferably experience karmaphala=\r\n in this life&quot; pool and the rest in the third pool which may not be experie=\r\nnced anytime soon. The way karmas are assigned and ordered in these pools i=\r\ns based on the balancing of karma/karmaphala sequencing of all beings.\n&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;The assignment and ordering of these pools will constantly undergo chu=\r\nrn as one engages in various new actions and adds them to the pools. Also, =\r\nas new people enter one&#39;s life, possibilities in terms of karmaphala delive=\r\nry agents and sequencing may change and hence the pools may be re-arranged.=\r\n\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;As one engages in remedial measures suc=\r\nh as prayers, fasting, donations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, chang=\r\ne one&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings (inc=\r\nluding planets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of karma=\r\nphala, who operate through other people who act as physical agents of deliv=\r\nery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirable kar=\r\nmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order within the sa=\r\nme pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or push=\r\ned up in order within the same pool.\n&gt;=C2=A0When someone curses or blesses =\r\none, with sufficient mental force behind it (this is the key), the same thi=\r\nng can happen. It is all about re-arranging karmas between the karmik pools=\r\n. Every action by one, or even people around one, has the potential to re-a=\r\nrrange one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma about to give karmaphala may be postpone=\r\nd or a karma that was not to give karmaphala anytime soon may be advanced s=\r\nooner.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;However, remember that the remedial measure has to be as in=\r\ntense as the karma that it is trying to manipulate. You can move a small ro=\r\nck with small force, but you need a large force to move a big rock or a hil=\r\nl.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a s=\r\npecific result, nobody can make one experience that result, no matter what =\r\nritual one does. However, even great souls have a lot of negative karmas in=\r\n their optional pool and even evil people have a lot of positive karmas in =\r\ntheir optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and blessings can =\r\noften make some difference.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;This point is well illustrated by the =\r\n&quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his point (3).\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;If one thinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s =\r\nactions, one is mistakened. God is not like us human beings, who may show f=\r\navoritism towards those who praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God=\r\n is a witness to the play of actions and fruits. The She-aspect of God is t=\r\nhe power that impartially and impassionately manages the fine balance and o=\r\nrder within this play of actions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her ey=\r\nes, from the lowest of evil persons to the noblest of saints. She administe=\r\nrs just and balanced delivery of fruits to actions using available agents.\n=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;The karmas we committed in the past are already in the pipeline an=\r\nd will give their results sooner or later. The best we can do with them, wi=\r\nth some effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most important thi=\r\nng is to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline now. Simply put, s=\r\nelfish actions and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad karmas=\r\n and selfless actions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to others =\r\nare good karmas.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;When it comes to manipulating the pre-existing pi=\r\npeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort and current =\r\naction, yes, it is possible and general guidelines are available in shastra=\r\ns, but we can&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each action. One th=\r\ning is for sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has to be commens=\r\nurate with the karma\n itself.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;You need only small force to push a =\r\ncat out of your way, but need a large force to push an elephant.\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;--------\n&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;--------\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;________________________=\r\n________\n&gt;&gt; From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM\n&gt;&gt;Subject: R=\r\ne: [vedic-wisdom] few questions\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;Dear=C2=A0Digamber,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, a special elephant was appointed by =\r\nthe courtiers to randomly pick the next king. Thus, it was possible for a b=\r\neggar to suddenly find himself the king. Whose karma is this?=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;Vasishtha gives two answers: (1) This is the karma of the ministers, king,=\r\n and all the citizens, and (2) This is the karma of the beggar turned king.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Everything is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s karma made him a king. Th=\r\ne elephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the king. The m=\r\ninister&#39;s karma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the king. And =\r\nthe citizens&#39; karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and accept the =\r\nresult.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oa=\r\nth. Many of the curses that we see are for the benefit of mankind, and are =\r\nactually blessings. At the end of the day, some people with a certain amoun=\r\nt of purity of speech discharge their tapas shakti through speech.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\nWhen it comes to people and their karmic pipeline, we usually make an assum=\r\nption. We assume that there is a person, and separate from the person are h=\r\nis many karmas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time. We=\r\n then want someone to come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic =\r\npipeline.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Vasishtha teaches us that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the =\r\nsame thing. You are your karmas. And you are nothing but your mind-impressi=\r\nons ... your vaasanaas. In other words, your vaasanaas are your karmas.\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, you have changed your karma. Or cour=\r\nse, that is easier said than done.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Any moment when your mind become=\r\ns quiet is a blessing. Any moment when your mind becomes agitated is a curs=\r\ne.

However, it is not easy. When we receive the fruits o=\r\nf some really terrible karmas, our mind gets so twisted and agitated that w=\r\ne lose our balance and our judgment gets badly beated. This may result in f=\r\nurther bad karmas being committed in that agitated/confused state.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;Thus, it IS sometimes useful to push off some really bad impending kar=\r\nmas when one is still in a position to do so. If one reaches a calmer state=\r\n of mind in that borrowed time, one may be able to handle the bad fruits be=\r\ntter. It is even possible theoretically that one pushes off a really bad ka=\r\nrma, makes progress during that borrowed\n time, reaches an equanimous state=\r\n of mind, becomes liberated and then faces the karma as a liberated being w=\r\nith a totally equanimous mind that does not get agitated.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:itali=\r\nc;&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Comment 2&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;s=\r\npan id=3D&quot;yiv256226775yui_3_7_2_18_1362375052103_47&quot;&gt;Prarabda karma is whic=\r\nh was already done and sanchitha and agami are what we going to do.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:it=\r\nalic;&quot;&gt;My Response&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Actually sanchita karmas are also karmas =\r\nalready done. Sanchita means &quot;piled up&quot;. Prarabdha karmas are different in =\r\nthe sense that their fructification has\n &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;=\r\n&gt;already begun&lt;/span&gt;. The verb &quot;prArabh&quot; means &quot;to begin&quot;. Its noun form &quot;=\r\nprArambha&quot; means &quot;beginning&quot; and its gerund noun form &quot;prArabdha&quot; means &quot;th=\r\ne [one that was] begun&quot;. Prarabdha karmas are actions for which the process=\r\n of reaction has already begun and in the pipeline. Whereas sanchita karmas=\r\n are piled up karmas that have not kicked off their fruits yet. They can be=\r\n delayed indefinitely. If one becomes liberated while living, one can merge=\r\n in Cosmic Self without experiencing the fruits of sanchita karmas. However=\r\n, fruits of prarabdha karmas are already in the pipeline and need to be exp=\r\nerienced even by a liberated being.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Though fruits of prarabdha=\r\n karmas are already in the pipeline, even they can actually be delayed or m=\r\nanipulated. Bottomline is that there are agents of delivery at the physical=\r\n and subtle level even for things deep in the pipeline and hence some limit=\r\ned adjustment is possible.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div\n style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:1=\r\n3px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-family:arial, helve=\r\ntica, clean, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight=\r\n:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Comment 3&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family=\r\n:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-s=\r\nize:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt; &lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;How does &lt;i&gt;nishkam karma&lt;/i&gt; works?

But, if one has minimal identification with a body-mind complex to just s=\r\nustain it, pursues no agenda and engages in whatever action is natural in t=\r\nhe situation one is in (but not driven by any conditioning, i.e. agendas or=\r\n desires or likes/dislikes), then one is untouched by karmas performed in t=\r\nhat state.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In the words of Swami Sivananda of Hrishikesh, &quot;The=\r\n accumulated and current actions of a Jnani take shelter in Brahmanda Prakr=\r\niti&quot;. In other words, Sanchita karmas (piled up actions from past that have=\r\n not yet begun fructifying) and aagami karmas (actions being performed righ=\r\nt now) of a liberated being take shelted in\n Cosmic Kinetic Consciousness (=\r\nBrahmanda Prakriti).&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-st=\r\nyle:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:it=\r\nalic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-sty=\r\nle:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Comment 4&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;If my destiny is to suffer, why should I pray to God? And i=\r\nf i am being \npunished for some kind of bad karma from the past, why am i n=\r\not aware of\n it? It is like getting punishment without knowing your bad dee=\r\nds.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight=\r\n:bold;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;My Response&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;One &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;need not pray to God.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; All o=\r\nne needs to do is to stop engaging in problematic karmas to add to the pile=\r\n of such karmas from the past. More importantly, one needs to reach a calm =\r\nand sustainable state of mind in which that can be maintained even in the m=\r\niddle of a tumultous hurricane caused in one&#39;s life due to serious bad karm=\r\nas from the past. Once serious troubles set in or mind focuses on sense obj=\r\nects, material world and one&#39;s pleasures and pains, mind tends to lose its =\r\nbalance and judgment, starts pursuing its limited selfish agendas and start=\r\ns performing even more bad karmas. Thus, praying to God and contemplating v=\r\narious ideals and qualities that God represents can give a shelter to the m=\r\nind in\n which it can maintain some calmness, balance and judgment. If that =\r\nis not the case for one, perhaps one needs to perfect it further.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;God has no age=\r\nnda to either punish you or hide the reason. God is an impartial balancer o=\r\nf reactions to all actions. If there is something unreasonable about the re=\r\naction you are getting, it means your action had a similar unreasonableness=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Let me turn ar=\r\nound your question on being &quot;aware&quot; and ask a simple question. When we caus=\r\ne loss or hurt to someone, do we always tell that person why we are doing i=\r\nt? If not, how can we expect someone to tell us before causing loss or hurt=\r\n to\n us? If I caused terrible strife to someone pious and pure for no reaso=\r\nn, then Nature will use someone in future to cause terrible strife to me de=\r\nspite my piety and purity and apparently for no reason.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In fac=\r\nt, what will you achieve by knowing exactly what was the action that caused=\r\n what is happening to you right now? Why is that useful? More useful is you=\r\nr conscience (a representation of God in each heart) that tells you right f=\r\nrom wrong. It constantly gives guidance on which actions will give good rea=\r\nctions *in future*.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;*&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-styl=\r\ne:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span\n style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;Comment 5&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Vasana can be for wealth, fame, power, domination (a struggle for =\r\npower!) etc. Many ripus, many reasons...!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:ita=\r\nlic;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;=\r\nMy Response&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Well-said. Though we are disc=\r\nussing karma and karma phala here, the root cause of karma is vasana in chi=\r\nttaakasha. (Chidaakaasha is the space of pure consciousness and chittaakaas=\r\nha is the space of conditioned consciousness that has likes, dislikes, desi=\r\nres, agendas etc.) Vasishtha defined liberation as overcoming vasanas in Yo=\r\nga Vaasishtham and Patanjali defined yoga as &quot;chitta vR^itti nirodhaH yogaH=\r\n&quot; (resisting the working of conditioning is\n &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;oneness with Cosmic Self&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;) in Yoga Sutras. Until we overcome our vasanas, we =\r\nare bound. Some are dense and some are very subtle. But all of them bind us=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nstyle:italic;&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;span s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;Comment 6&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-size:small;&quot;&gt;:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-f=\r\namily:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;span\n style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt; &lt;fon=\r\nt&gt;&lt;font&gt;1. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font&gt;As\n per S=\r\nhri Vimalananda, you may also offer all the karmas as Homa to inner \ndevas =\r\nor ishta devta? He mentioned that there is lesser of suffering if \nyou do t=\r\nhat. Who gets the remaining delta suffering?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;My Response&lt;/span&gt;:&lt;/span&gt; Ka=\r\nrmaphala for a specific karma is not a function of that karma alone. It is =\r\na function of that karma and one&#39;s current state of mind. If someone serves=\r\n spoiled food, one may get an upset stomach for half day or diaria for a we=\r\nek. It depends on how strong one is. Similarly, the same karmaphala set in =\r\nmotion by the same external agents of delivery (physical &amp; subtle) can =\r\ncause different reaction inside one, depending on one&#39;s current state of mi=\r\nnd.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;An idle mind is devil&#39;s workshop. Our minds keep vibrating=\r\n with various notions and thoughts. A mind vibrating with selfish desires a=\r\nnd unnecessary clutter/confusion *amplifies* the negative effects of one&#39;s =\r\nenvironment (through which fruits of karmas are\n administered).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;If one thinks of ishta devata with reverence and contemplates various ide=\r\nals and qualities of ishta devata and mind vibrates with saattwik energy, i=\r\nt absorbs the negative effects of one&#39;s environment better or at least does=\r\n not amplify them.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;A=\r\nstrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank=\r\n&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/=\r\na&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;background-color:tr=\r\nansparent;font-style:normal;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif=\r\n;&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left:2px so=\r\nlid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size:10pt;font-family:arial, he=\r\nlvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size:12pt;font-family:&#39;times new =\r\nroman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; =\r\nsize=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span\n style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha P.V.R.

Shakti is the sum total of all the beings with vario=\r\nus agendas engaging in various karmas and experiencing various karmaphalas.=\r\n Purusha is the witness of it all.&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Though each karma s=\r\nhould give karmaphala that is commensurate with it, that requires an *agent=\r\n* to deliver the\n karmaphala, i.e. another\n being. So this\n requires a comp=\r\nlicated balancing act on part of Cosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i=\r\n.e. Shakti). There are very complicated rules that decide the *sequencing* =\r\nof karmaphalas and picking of agents for their delivery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;At any time, some karmas from one&#39;s past are placed in a &quot;&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;must &lt;/span&gt;experience karmaphala in this li=\r\nfe&quot; pool, some karmas in a &quot;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;preferably &lt;=\r\n/span&gt;experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool and the rest in the third po=\r\nol which may not be experienced anytime soon. The way karmas are assigned a=\r\nnd ordered in these pools is based on the balancing of karma/karmaphala seq=\r\nuencing of all beings.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The assignment and orderi=\r\nng of these pools will constantly undergo churn as one engages in various n=\r\new actions and adds them to the pools. Also, as new people enter one&#39;s life=\r\n, possibilities in terms of karmaphala delivery agents\n and sequencing may =\r\nchange and hence the pools may be re-arranged.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;*=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;As one engages in remedial measure=\r\ns such as prayers, fasting, donations etc, one may transform one&#39;s nature, =\r\nchange one&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s dynamics with other beings=\r\n (including planets, deities etc, who are the subtle agents of delivery of =\r\nkarmaphala, who operate through other people who act as physical agents of =\r\ndelivery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as a result. Some undesirabl=\r\ne karmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or pushed down in order within t=\r\nhe same pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be upgraded to a higher pool or=\r\n pushed up in order within the same pool.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;When someon=\r\ne curses or blesses one, with &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;sufficient=\r\n &lt;/span&gt;mental force behind it (this is the key),\n the same thing &lt;span&gt;can=\r\n &lt;/span&gt;happen. It is all about re-arranging karmas between the karmik pool=\r\ns. Every action by one, or even people around one, has the &lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-style:italic;&quot;&gt;potential &lt;/span&gt;to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik pools. A kar=\r\nma about to give karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was not to giv=\r\ne karmaphala anytime soon may be advanced sooner.&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Howe=\r\nver, remember that the remedial measure has to be as intense as the karma t=\r\nhat it is trying to manipulate. You can move a small rock with small force,=\r\n but you need a large force to move a big rock or a hill.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;div&gt;If there is no negative karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a &lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;specific &lt;/span&gt;result, nobody can make one expe=\r\nrience &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;that &lt;/span&gt;result, no matter wha=\r\nt ritual one does. However, even great souls have a lot of negative karmas =\r\nin their optional pool and even evil people\n have a lot of positive karmas =\r\nin their optional pool, and hence powerful remedies, curses and blessings c=\r\nan often make some difference.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;This point is wel=\r\nl illustrated by the &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber ji referred in his poin=\r\nt (3).&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;If one thinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s actions, one is mist=\r\nakened. God is not like us human beings, who may show favoritism towards th=\r\nose who praise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God is a witness to the=\r\n play of actions and fruits. The She-aspect of God is the power that impart=\r\nially and impassionately manages the fine balance and order within this pla=\r\ny of actions and fruits. All beings are equal in Her eyes, from the lowest =\r\nof evil persons to the noblest of saints. She administers just and balanced=\r\n delivery of fruits to actions using\n available agents.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;The karmas we committed in the past are already in the pipeline and =\r\nwill give their results sooner or later. The best we can do with them, with=\r\n some effort, is to perhaps reorder them somewhat. The most important thing=\r\n is to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nstyle:italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;span&gt;ow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; Simply put, selfish ac=\r\ntions and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad karmas and self=\r\nless actions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to others are good =\r\nkarmas.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to manipulating the pre-existing pipelin=\r\ne of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort and current actio=\r\nn, yes, it is possible and general guidelines are available in shastras, bu=\r\nt we can&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each action. One thing i=\r\ns for sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has to be commensurate=\r\n with the karma\n itself.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;You need only small force to push a c=\r\nat out of your way, but need a large force to push an elephant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;font-s=\r\ntyle:normal;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Bes=\r\nt regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resourc=\r\nes: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologe=\r\nr.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, =\r\n0, 0);font-size:13px;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;font-fa=\r\nmily:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;bl=\r\nockquote style=3D&quot;border-left:2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-size:10pt;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-size:12pt;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif;&quot;&gt; &lt;di=\r\nv dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishna=\r\nn@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-we=\r\night:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] few questions&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font=\r\n&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv256226775&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv256226775ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;Dear&=\r\nnbsp;Digamber,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When a kingdom had no royal heirs, =\r\na special elephant was appointed by the courtiers to randomly pick the next=\r\n king. Thus, it was possible for a beggar to suddenly find himself the king=\r\n. Whose karma is this?&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vasishtha gives two=\r\n answers: (1) This is the karma of the ministers, king, and all the citizen=\r\ns, and (2) This is the karma of the beggar turned king.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;Everything is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s karma made him a king. The e=\r\nlephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the king. The mini=\r\nster&#39;s karma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the king. And the=\r\n citizens&#39; karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and accept the res=\r\nult.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, o=\r\nr promise, or oath. Many of the curses that we see are for the benefit of m=\r\nankind, and are actually blessings. At the end of the day, some people with=\r\n a certain amount of purity of speech discharge their tapas shakti through =\r\nspeech.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When it comes to people and their karmic=\r\n pipeline, we usually make an assumption. We assume that there is a person,=\r\n and separate from the person are his many karmas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; =\r\nto the person from time to time. We then want someone to come and remove al=\r\nl the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic pipeline.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vas=\r\nishtha teaches us that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You are y=\r\nour karmas. And you are nothing but your mind-impressions ... your vaasanaa=\r\ns. In other words, your vaasanaas are your karmas.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, you have changed your karma. Or course=\r\n, that is easier said than done.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Any moment when y=\r\nour mind becomes quiet is a blessing. Any moment when your mind becomes agi=\r\ntated is a curse. As sadhakas, we run after quieting the mind !&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;sasneham,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp=\r\n;ajit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv256226775gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Tue, Feb 26=\r\n, 2013 at 8:08 AM,  &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;ma=\r\nilto:dgporob@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:dgporob@...&quot;=\r\n&gt;dgporob@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;yiv2562267=\r\n75gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left:1px #ccc solid;&quot;&gt;\n\nDear Narasimha Ji,&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was pondering over few things we routinely=\r\n come across as a part of worship and how it manipulates karma pipe line,&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n(1) When someone gives a `curse&#39; or does a prayoga such as `maran&#39; or `u=\r\nchhatan&#39; what happens to a person who is at receiving end, does his bad kar=\r\nma comes forward or is it a new parabdha that is created. I vaguely remembe=\r\nr Vimalananda mentioning something about a Saint&#39;s curse in Aghora trilogy.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n(2) On similar note, what happens when you get `blessings&#39; say from =\r\na saint or elders? We also come across lot of tantric items like Rudraksha,=\r\n Parad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =E2=80=93 what do this items re=\r\nally do if they work? Something similar with wearing gemstones for planets =\r\n=E2=80=93 do they bring forward good karmas or they create new ones?&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n(3) I recollect an episode from famous &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well known in Mahara=\r\nshtra), wherein a just widowed lady cried out to Shri Guru &quot;If we cannot ch=\r\nange `parabdha, then, why do we worship God at all&quot;. At that point Shri Gur=\r\nu rejuvenates her dead husband, but later tells his shisya, that he has onl=\r\ny readjusted the karma from next birth. [Please excuse me if this is not ex=\r\nact word to word, as I am trying to recollect this episode from old memory]=\r\n. So question I have is, does our sadhana change karmaphal to a great exten=\r\nt or it is just our perception that changes?&lt;br&gt;\n\n\nThanking you,&lt;br&gt;\nDigamb=\r\ner&lt;br&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; =\r\n     \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/bod=\r\ny&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---1293697098-1656636761-1362465564=:11479--\r\n\n"}}
