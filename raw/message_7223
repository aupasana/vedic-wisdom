We have set up the poo=\r\nja sthaan in one of the rooms. My question is about the deities that we hav=\r\ne placed in our pooja sthaan. For some deities, we have many idols of them =\r\n(like Ganesha in 5 idol forms, 1 form with family, 1 as a Lakshmi-Ganesha f=\r\norm in coin and one in a picture form) and we have placed them in our pooja=\r\n sthaan in this house and earlier houses and prayed before them. Now we wis=\r\nh to keep only one form of each deity in our pooja sthaan (as while praying=\r\n to Lord Ganesha I am tempted to look at/face all the different forms in th=\r\ne pooja pedestal and hence I am not able to maintain focus) Could you pleas=\r\ne suggest if it is fine to do this (that is have only one form in the pooja=\r\n sthaan)? What should we do with the remaining idols/forms of the same deit=\r\ny? Is it ok to donate them at a nearby temple or immerse them in a nearby r=\r\niver/ocean? \n\nPlease provide your kind guidance. If it is not right to do t=\r\nhis or even think like this, I apologize sincerely. But if it is ok, kindly=\r\n advise. \n\nOn the same note, I also wanted to ask you if someone gifts an i=\r\ndol/picture of a deity, should we keep them also in the pooja sthaan, and i=\r\nf we do, then it brings us back to the original question of having more tha=\r\nn one idol for each deity. \n\nAwaiting your view/advise to get more clarity.=\r\n\n\nKind regards,\n\nManish\n\n\n"}}
