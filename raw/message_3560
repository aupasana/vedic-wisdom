In some explanat=\r\nions it is equated with Vignana. However Supramental &#39;descent&#39; and Supramen=\r\ntal &#39;transformation&#39; are different entities altogether which deal with desc=\r\nent / manifestation of that level of consciousness directly in our terrestr=\r\nial world and the transformation of our world of matter to express that con=\r\nsciousness directly. These are things that have not been achieved before Sr=\r\ni Aurobindo. In Sri Krishna&#39;s time, Sri Krishna established in earth a leve=\r\nl of consciousness which Sri Aurobindo called Overmind which is one level l=\r\nower than Supermind. Each Avatar established a level of consciousness for w=\r\nhich earth was suited for at that time. Now thanks to all the work of past =\r\nMasters, earth is suited for Supramental transformation.\n\nIt should be note=\r\nd that Mother and Sri Aurobindo are not talking about individual realizatio=\r\nns as they themselves realized the highest consciousness and which they sai=\r\nd few/several other being have also realized. *** They are talking about es=\r\ntablishing it in collective terrestrial consciousness. *** This is one plac=\r\ne where people often go wrong. While Ramana Maharishi and other Masters sho=\r\nwed the path for individually attaining the highest consciousness and &#39;esca=\r\nping&#39; the world of untruth, Sri Aurobindo&#39;s focus is to transform the world=\r\n of untruth (or veiled truth) to a world of truth at a collective level and=\r\n not individual realization of highest concisousness. In Sri Aurobindo&#39;s pa=\r\nth individual realization is a side effect and a pre-requisite for the fina=\r\nl goal, while in the path of most other Masters individual realization is t=\r\nhe final goal.\n\nSupramental transformation  is something new for which foun=\r\ndation has been laid out by various Rishis and Avatara purushas (not just S=\r\nri Aurobindo and the Mother, though they were / are at the forefront and le=\r\nading the effort) for past several millenniums. It is a new realization / h=\r\nappening which is not explained clearly in any old scripture. However as pe=\r\nr Sri Aurobindo Vedas do contain seeds of it in a hidden form and Vedic Ris=\r\nhis did have the experiences of Supramental descent but the world and human=\r\nity is only ready now for the full and irreversible Supramental transformat=\r\nion.\n\nIndia&#39;s spiritual awakening, the establishment of one world family in=\r\n the form of union of governments, reawakening of Asia, collective human un=\r\nity, etc., are several stages in that long goal. \n\nIt is happening slowly i=\r\nn front of our very eyes and may take several more centuries or even few mi=\r\nllenniums to fully establish itself. One of the consequences will be a radi=\r\nal evolution of humanity, much more radical and profound than what happened=\r\n when we evolved from Apes to humans (simplistically speaking). As per the =\r\nMother and Sri Aurobindo, the body of the new beings that have realized sup=\r\nramental transformation in their matter will be a body of light and as such=\r\n is not subject to laws of nature that we are aware of now. Those bodies of=\r\n light can be prolonged as much as needed or modified into another form wit=\r\nhout the soul having to leave it and take birth in another form as it is ha=\r\nppening today. What I put above is only a crude way of putting it and does =\r\nnot do justice to the topic. For lack of better vocabulary this was called =\r\nphysical immortality which several people have misunderstood, even though S=\r\nri Aurobindo himself made jokes about it.. He said something to the effect =\r\nthat wouldnt it be very boring to use the same raincoat for 500 years? \n\nBu=\r\nt human mind being what it is, it distorts what Sri Aurobindo and the Mothe=\r\nr spoke about.\n\nTo explain it in a few pages or even several pages is diffi=\r\ncult or even impossible as even the concept is very new and our mind will c=\r\nonfuse it with some other thing we already know. Several yogis even god rea=\r\nlized ones have made the mistake of confusing Sri Aurobindo&#39;s message. As o=\r\nf now, I am not qualified enough to summarize what Sri Aurobindo and the Mo=\r\nther meant by Supramental descent. \n\nThe best one can do is to surrender to=\r\n Divine Mother and read Life Divine, Savitri and the Agenda (all 13 volumes=\r\n). Understanding it is not a function of one&#39;s intelligence. It is a blessi=\r\nng / Grace. A less intelligent person may understand correctly while a grea=\r\nt intellectual mind might misunderstand it.\n\nIf reading these voluminous te=\r\nxts is difficult, one can start with the simpler works of the famous yogi &=\r\n scholar M.P. Pandit (who was Mother&#39;s secretary and custodian of the Ashra=\r\nm after Mother&#39;s Mahasamadhi). Another excellent choice would be Satprem&#39;s =\r\nwritings. Especially his book &quot;Sri Aurobindo or Adventure of Consciousness&quot;=\r\n is a classic. It is said that most of the writings of the book was inspire=\r\nd by Sri Aurobindo himself and Satprem was merely writing down what came to=\r\n him with the Mother correcting him as necessary.\n\n In my limited reading, =\r\nI haven&#39;t come across any other work which so clearly and lucidly explains =\r\nvarious layers of consciousness and a classic introduction to anyone who wa=\r\nnts to comprehend or follow Sri Aurobindo&#39;s message. One could have read Yo=\r\nga Vaashistam and may still find that there is lot to learn from the book &quot;=\r\nSri Aurobindo or the Adventure of Consciousness&quot;. One of the very direct be=\r\nnefit of reading that book is that our awareness grows by leaps and bounds =\r\njust by assimilating the knowledge in that book.

But the fullness of the supramental change is not=\r\n possible, if the body remains as it is, a slave of death, disease, decay, =\r\npain, unconsciousness and all the other results of ignorance. If these are =\r\nto remain the descent of the supramental is hardly necessary - for a change=\r\n of consciousness which would mean mental - spiritual union with the Divine=\r\n, the Overmind is sufficient, even the Higher Mind is sufficient. The Supra=\r\nmental Descent is necessary for the dynamic action of the Truth in mind, vi=\r\ntal and body. This would imply as=C2=A0a final result the disappearence of =\r\nthe unconsciousness of the body; it would no longer be subject to death or =\r\ndisease. That would mean it would not be subject to ordinary processes by w=\r\nhich death comes. If a change in the body had to be made, it would be by th=\r\ne will of the inhabitant. This would be the essence of physical\n&gt;  immortal=\r\nity. If someone wanted to live 1000 years or more, then supposing one had t=\r\nhe complete siddhi, it would not be impossible. There can be no immortality=\r\n of the body without supramentalization. &quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Again at another plac=\r\ne Sri Aurobindo states that immoratlity is not the aim of Supramental Desce=\r\nnt, but one of the possibilities.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I did not quite understand, wh=\r\nat exactly is this Supramental Descent, if it has nothing to do with physic=\r\nal immortality. Because, connecting the and uplifting the ordinary mind to =\r\nthe state of divinity and functioning from that sphere is something that mo=\r\nst self realized Yogis do. Then how is &quot;Supramental Descent&quot; so unique?\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Again if, as we see from the above writings, a total transformatio=\r\nn is what is being spoken off, that would mean also a transformation of the=\r\n body. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Well, the Naths(nine Naths), Munis and Rishis can exist =\r\nas immortals in this plane. Is that what Supramental Descent is?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rama Naama Satya Hai..\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sa=\r\nt, 23/1/10, schinnas &lt;schinnas@gmail. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: schinnas &lt;s=\r\nchinnas@gmail. com&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Part 1- The Recollections=\r\n of Ramana Maharshi Devotee N.

Immediately upon my\n&gt; &gt; arrival I was struck by th=\r\ne spiritual atmosphere of the place. On August\n&gt; &gt; 15th of that year, I had=\r\n my first darshan of Sri Aurobindo. This was one of\n&gt; &gt; three times in a ye=\r\nar that he gave darshan. I found Sri Aurobindo and Mother\n&gt; &gt; to be\n&gt;  powe=\r\nrful spiritual personalities, as they seemed to have the ability\n&gt; &gt; to wor=\r\nk on the development of their disciples in a silent and invisible\n&gt; &gt; manne=\r\nr. All of Aurobindo&#39;s philosophical writings cannot convey his or the\n&gt; &gt; M=\r\nother&#39;s power as spiritual embodiments.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; While I was in Aurobindo A=\r\nshrama I met Kapali Sastriar, the esteemed\n&gt; &gt; disciple of both Aurobindo a=\r\nnd Ganapati Muni. As he was now and then\n&gt; &gt; visiting Sri Ramanasramam, he =\r\nwould describe to me the Maharshi and his\n&gt; &gt; ashrama. His intriguing descr=\r\niptions, along with the reading of B. V.\n&gt; &gt; Narasimhaswami&#39; s biography of=\r\n the Maharshi, is what prompted my first visit\n&gt; &gt; to Ramanasramam in 1933.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Before this second visit to Ramanasramam I once again read Bhagav=\r\nan&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; biography. In it I found a passage relating to the possibility of =\r\nchanging\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s guru. I had a doubt about this and addressed it to the\n&gt;=\r\n  Maharshi. He\n&gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Yes. Certainly. One can change his guru. What =\r\nof that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In Aurobindo Ashrama our daily life, to a large extent, =\r\nwas regulated and\n&gt; &gt; controlled. For instance, even to take a simple trip =\r\ninto town we had to\n&gt; &gt; obtain permission. In contrast, here in Ramanasrama=\r\nm it was totally\n&gt; &gt; different. I experienced a liberating feeling of freed=\r\nom, informality and\n&gt; &gt; spontaneity. Everything was so natural and at the s=\r\name time elevating.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, in Aurobindo Ashrama, disciples were gen=\r\nerally permitted to visit all\n&gt; &gt; other saints and ashramas, with the excep=\r\ntion of the Maharshi and Sri\n&gt; &gt; Ramanasramam. It was believed that the Mah=\r\narshi had the power to undo years\n&gt; &gt; of spiritual preparation that the Mot=\r\nher and Aurobindo were effecting on the\n&gt; &gt; psyche of their followers. In o=\r\nther words, they considered the Maharshi too\n&gt; &gt; powerful an influence. Bha=\r\ngavan was\n&gt;  aware of this and once when I was alone\n&gt; &gt; with him he told m=\r\ne, &quot;Yes, I know of that place. They are afraid of me.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Leaving Aur=\r\nobindo Ashram\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I had been with the Mother and Aurobindo for five ye=\r\nars. During those years\n&gt; &gt; they showered me with kindness and love, while =\r\nguiding me on the spiritual\n&gt; &gt; path. My gratitude and regard for them comp=\r\nelled me to obtain their\n&gt; &gt; permission and blessings before leaving. This =\r\nturned out to be much more\n&gt; &gt; difficult than I imagined.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In Aurob=\r\nindo Ashram, it was the practice of the disciples who had doubts or\n&gt; &gt; que=\r\nstions to write them in the form of a letter to Sri Aurobindo. All the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nletters were daily collected and taken to Aurobindo, who would sit with the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Mother during the nights and promptly answer them in writing. Sometime=\r\ns we\n&gt; &gt; would see the lights burning all night as they were engaged in thi=\r\ns work.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Upon my return from Ramanasramam I wrote a letter stati=\r\nng my desire to\n&gt; &gt; receive their blessings and permission to live at Raman=\r\nasramam. In the\n&gt; &gt; letter to Aurobindo I wrote that since your yoga begins=\r\n with\n&gt; &gt; Self-realization, kindly permit me to go to Ramana Maharshi who e=\r\nmphasizes\n&gt; &gt; only Self-realization, a state I have not attained, or may no=\r\nt even be\n&gt; &gt; worthy of attaining. Aurobindo&#39;s reply was affectionate, but =\r\nnegative in\n&gt; &gt; regards to my leaving his ashram. He wrote, &quot;Both Self-real=\r\nization and the\n&gt; &gt; supra-mental state can be simultaneously developed and =\r\nachieved here. There\n&gt; &gt; is no need for you to go there.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was ex=\r\ntremely disappointed at his response and consequently became\n&gt; &gt; frustrated=\r\n, restless and discouraged. I soon began to have sleepless nights\n&gt; &gt; and f=\r\nelt distraught. I then wrote a second letter to Aurobindo with the same\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n request. Again I was\n&gt;  denied permission. It took a long five months and =\r\na\n&gt; &gt; third letter before Aurobindo and the Mother finally agreed, giving m=\r\ne their\n&gt; &gt; permission and blessings. Perhaps they realized I was determine=\r\nd to go and\n&gt; &gt; they saw no other recourse but to grant my request.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; In Aurobindo&#39;s final letter to me he wrote, &quot;Since you are determined to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; follow a path in which you can achieve only partial realization, we giv=\r\ne you\n&gt; &gt; our blessings, though we believe it would be better if you stayed=\r\n on here\n&gt; &gt; and pursued your sadhana where both the Mother and I can help =\r\nyou.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was the rule in Aurobindo Ashram that any letter written =\r\nto or received\n&gt; &gt; from Aurobindo should not leave the ashram premises. So,=\r\n to comply with this\n&gt; &gt; rule, I burnt all my letters, except the final let=\r\nter I received from\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo. This I kept with the view of showing it =\r\nto Bhagavan.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Settling\n&gt;  at Sri Ramanasramam\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; During the e=\r\narly years there were no houses anywhere near the ashram, as it\n&gt; &gt; was mos=\r\ntly jungle or forest. I eventually found an upstairs room in a\n&gt; &gt; brahmin&#39;=\r\ns house near the Arunachala Temple in town. For my meals I would\n&gt; &gt; someti=\r\nmes cook small items in my room, sometimes obtain food from somewhere\n&gt; &gt; o=\r\nutside, and somehow manage without feeling inconvenienced.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Daily I=\r\n would rise at about 3 or 4 a.m., walk to the ashram, stay in the\n&gt; &gt; hall =\r\nwith Bhagavan until 10 a.m., return to my room, come back again to the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nashram at 3 p.m. and stay there until 8 p.m. It went on like this during th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; first year. If possible, I would always sit close to Bhagavan so I co=\r\nuld\n&gt; &gt; hear all of his precious utterances.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; S. S. Cohen, after re=\r\npeatedly hearing about Sri Aurobindo, decided that the\n&gt; &gt; Yogi from Pondic=\r\nherry must have some greatness.\n&gt;  Consequently, one day he\n&gt; &gt; travelled t=\r\no Pondicherry and while there wrote a note to Aurobindo\n&gt; &gt; describing who =\r\nhe was, what he wanted from life (Self-realization) and where\n&gt; &gt; he was th=\r\nen residing (Sri Ramanasramam) . Cohen later showed me the reply he\n&gt; &gt; got=\r\n from Aurobindo. It said, in brief, that all his aspirations could be\n&gt; &gt; f=\r\nulfilled at Sri Ramanasramam, where he was then living.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I remember=\r\n during my second visit to Ramanasramam the Maharshi was one day\n&gt; &gt; readin=\r\ng a lengthy book review from a newspaper. The book being reviewed was\n&gt; &gt; A=\r\nurobindo&#39;s Lights on Yoga. The reviewer was Kapali Sastri and the editor of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; this newspaper was Bhagavan&#39;s devotee, S. M. Kamath. Bhagavan seemed t=\r\no take\n&gt; &gt; great interest in the review and would occasionally stop reading=\r\n and comment\n&gt; &gt; on what he had just read to those sitting around him. When=\r\n he had concluded\n&gt; &gt; reading it, someone who was\n&gt;  aware that I had that =\r\nvery book with me, said to\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan, &quot;This man has come from the Aurobi=\r\nndo Ashram and he has that book\n&gt; &gt; with him.&quot; Bhagavan turned to me and sa=\r\nid, &quot;Oh, is that so? Let me have a\n&gt; &gt; look at it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I went back to=\r\n my room, fetched the book and handed it over to Bhagavan.\n&gt; &gt; Immediately =\r\nBhagavan began reading it intently. He kept on reading it well\n&gt; &gt; into the=\r\n night, with the help of a small oil lamp, until he finished it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; W=\r\nhen I came into the hall the next day he began discussing the book with me,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; telling me that a certain term used in the book might look like someth=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; new, but it is actually the equivalent of this other term used in s=\r\nuch and\n&gt; &gt; such ancient text, etc. Like this, he went on discussing and co=\r\nmparing\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy for some time. SoBhagavan thoroughly und=\r\nerstood\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo&#39;s philosophy both intellectually and also\n&gt;  from the=\r\n standpoint of\n&gt; &gt; experience.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One evening I said to Bhagavan that=\r\n the major attraction of Aurobindo&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; teachings is that it professes tha=\r\nt immortality of the body can be achieved.\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan made no comment.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The next day, as soon as I walked into the hall and sat down, Bhagav=\r\nan\n&gt; &gt; looked at me and began saying, &quot;In Kumbhakonam there was one yogi, C=\r\n. V. V.\n&gt; &gt; Rao, who was proclaiming to all, his doctrine of the immortalit=\r\ny of the\n&gt; &gt; body. He was even so bold as to declare that Dr. Annie Besant =\r\n(a\n&gt; &gt; distinguished public and spiritual personality in India) would have =\r\nto come\n&gt; &gt; to him to learn how to make her body immortal. But, before he h=\r\nad a chance\n&gt; &gt; to meet Dr. Annie Besant, he died.&quot; This brief story clearl=\r\ny illustrated his\n&gt; &gt; point.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On another day, not too long after se=\r\nttling near Sri Ramanasramam, I\n&gt; &gt; approached Bhagavan when no\n&gt;  one was =\r\nin the hall and showed him that last\n&gt; &gt; letter I had received from Aurobin=\r\ndo. Bhagavan asked me to give it to him to\n&gt; &gt; read. I told him he would be=\r\n unable to decipher Aurobindo&#39;s handwriting, as\n&gt; &gt; it was very illegible a=\r\nnd only those who have studied it for sometime could\n&gt; &gt; read it. He said, =\r\n&quot;Give it to me. Let me try.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After looking into it and realizing h=\r\ne could only make out a few words, he\n&gt; &gt; returned it and asked me to read =\r\nit out. I began reading it and when I came\n&gt; &gt; to the sentence, &quot;Since you =\r\nare determined to follow a path in which you can\n&gt; &gt; achieve only partial r=\r\nealization . . .&quot;, Bhagavan stopped me and said,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Partial realization? =\r\nIf it is partial, it is not realization, and if it is\n&gt; &gt; realization, it i=\r\ns not partial.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This was the final blow that silenced all my doubt=\r\ns. I then destroyed this\n&gt; &gt; letter, like all the rest. And because of all =\r\nthe\n&gt;  discussions I had had with\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan I soon felt perfectly establ=\r\nished in his teachings, having a clear\n&gt; &gt; understanding of where the Mahar=\r\nshi&#39;s path and Aurobindo&#39;s path diverged and\n&gt; &gt; went different ways. When =\r\nall the clouds of doubts and distractions\n&gt; &gt; dispersed, so did our discuss=\r\nions. Bhagavan then knew that I understood and\n&gt; &gt; the foundation work had =\r\nbeen done. The purpose of all our discussions were\n&gt; &gt; served and so they s=\r\ntopped automatically.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I believe the most unique characteristic of =\r\nBhagavan was the power of his\n&gt; &gt; presence. Much of what he taught had alre=\r\nady been transmitted to the masses\n&gt; &gt; down through the ages. In Bhagavan w=\r\ne found a being that was surcharged with\n&gt; &gt; the Reality to such an extent =\r\nthat coming into his presence would effect a\n&gt; &gt; dramatic change in us.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Sources:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a) http://www.arunacha la.org/newslette rs/1995/? p=\r\ng=3Dmay-jun\n&gt; &gt; b) http://www.arunacha la.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3Dmar-=\r\napr\n&gt; &gt; c) http://www.arunacha la.org/newslette rs/1995/? pg=3Djul-aug\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; -- \n&gt; &gt; =D1=80=E2=96`&quot;=D1=80=E2=96`=D0&#39; =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B8=D1=80=E2=\r\n=96`=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9B =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BD=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=A7=D1=80=\r\n=E2=96`=E2=95=A1=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=97 =D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=\r\n=A2=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=96`=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=90 =D1=80=E2=96`=\r\n=E2=96`=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B3=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=9B=D1=80=\r\n=E2=96`=D0=BF\n&gt; &gt; =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BA=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=96=\r\n`=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=9B=D1=80=E2=96`=D0&#39;=D1=80=E2=96`=\r\n=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=AC=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=96&quot;=D1=80=E2=\r\n=96`=E2=95=95=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0&#39;=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D=D1=80=\r\n=E2=96`=E2=96`=D1=80=E2=96`=D0&#39;\n&gt; &gt; =D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BA=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D=\r\n=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=96`=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=97=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=BE=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=\r\n=97 =D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=A2=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=9B=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=A2=D1=\r\n=80=E2=96&#39;=D0=9D=D1=80=E2=96`=E2=95=A1=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=B4=D1=80=E2=96`=D0=\r\n=BE=D1=80=E2=96&#39;=D0`\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; Your Mail works best with the=\r\n New Yahoo Optimized IE8.
