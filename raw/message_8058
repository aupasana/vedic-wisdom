It is said that he is a form of Brahma who\n=\r\nwanted to walk the earth along with Vishnu when the latter took the form of=\r\n\nRama. But during that time, he had a thought, &quot;How I wish to fight with\nRa=\r\nma! But I cannot as I am his great devotee and admirer.&quot;****\n\n** **\n\nRama d=\r\nivined Jambavan&#39;s thoughts and said, &quot;In my next life, when I descend\nas Kr=\r\nishna, you will get the opportunity to fight me.&quot; And so it came to\npass th=\r\nat when Krishna was searching for the missing Syamantaka gem, he\nfound it w=\r\nith a bear cub who turned out to be Jambavan&#39;s son. When Krishna\ntried to c=\r\nlaim it, Jambavan challenged him to a fight. And so they\nwrestled, and as t=\r\nhey wrestled, Jambavan realised that he was fighting the\nman who was once R=\r\nama. His wish had been granted.****\n\n** **\n\nAnother celestial deity who acc=\r\nompanied Vishnu on earth was Adi Sesha, the\nserpent on whose coils sleeps V=\r\nishnu. When Vishnu was Rama, Adi Sesha was\nLakshmana and when Vishnu was Kr=\r\nishna, Adi Sesha was Balarama. Once\nLakshmana complained to Rama, &quot;I am tir=\r\ned of agreeing with you because you\nare my elder brother.&quot; So Rama said, &quot;I=\r\nn our next life, you will be the\nelder brother and I will be the younger br=\r\nother. You will still agree with\nme because you will realise that you do so=\r\n not because I am elder or older\nbut because I always uphold dharma.&quot;****\n\n=\r\n** **\n\nStories linking the Indic epics, the Ramayana, the Bhagavada and the=\r\n\nMahabharata, are very common in mythology. Another story states that when\n=\r\nRavana kidnapped Sita, Rama was inconsolable in his grief. All the trees\nan=\r\nd the animals and the men and women of the forest tried to hug him. But\nhe =\r\nrejected their embrace. &quot;Only Sita can touch me with such affection,&quot; he\nsa=\r\nid. Then he saw the disappointed faces of everyone around who was\nreaching =\r\nout to comfort him and said, &quot;In my next life, when I am Krishna,\nall of yo=\r\nu shall be gopis and we shall dance together in Madhuvan.&quot;****\n\n** **\n\nPerh=\r\naps the most interesting link is the story connecting Vishnu&#39;s\nrelationship=\r\n with the sun god Surya and the rain god Indra. In the\nRamayana, Vishnu is =\r\nRama and he supports Sugriva, the son of Surya, in his\nfight against Vali, =\r\nthe son of Indra. To balance the relationship in the\nMahabharata, Vishnu as=\r\n Krishna supports Indra&#39;s son, Arjuna, in his fight\nagainst Surya&#39;s son, Ka=\r\nrna. So what looks like unfairness in one life\nbecomes fair when one consid=\r\ners the previous life.****\n\n** **\n\nThus, the events of Mahabharata and Bhag=\r\navada cannot be explained without\nunderstanding events in the Ramayana. One=\r\n is the consequence while the\nother is the cause. Why was this weaving of e=\r\npics done, one wonders. This\nweaving turns every epic and every episode in =\r\nthe epic into pieces of a\nvast jigsaw puzzle. To understand the entire puzz=\r\nle you have to interlock\nall the stories, characters and events.****\n\n** **=\r\n\n\nNothing stands in isolation. Everything is dependent on something else.\nT=\r\nhus to know something about Indian mythology, you need to study all. And\nso=\r\n it is in life. To understand your today, you have to understand\nyesterday.=\r\n We are all products of the past. Today&#39;s Krishna was yesterday&#39;s\nRama and =\r\ntoday&#39;s Kansa was yesterday&#39;s Ravana.****\n\n** **\n\nThe author is chief belie=\r\nf officer of Future Group. devdutt.com****\n\n** **\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =\r\n=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =\r\n =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--f46d04426f1483ee5004bbc52ed5\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div lang=3D&quot;EN-GB&quot; link=3D&quot;blue&quot; vlink=3D&quot;purpl=\r\ne&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://articles.timesofindia.indi=\r\natimes.com/2012-03-20/vintage-wisdom/30631242_1_vishnu-epics-ramayana&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2012-03-20/vintag=\r\ne-wisdom/30631242_1_vishnu-epics-ramayana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p class=\r\n=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;=C2=A0&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;The Ramayan=\r\na, Mahabharata and the Bhagavada cannot be\nstudied in isolation, says Devdu=\r\ntt Pattanaik.&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;=C2=A0&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u=\r\n&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;In the Ramayana is the story of a bear called=\r\n Jambavan who\nserved Rama with devotion, helping him along with the army of=\r\n monkeys to attack\nLanka and defeat the demon-king Ravana.
