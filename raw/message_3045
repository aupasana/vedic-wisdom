I was going throug=\r\nh this yahoo groups and found one of the messages where you were advising s=\r\nomeone to do &#39;chandihomam&#39; based on his birth chart. Likewise, I would like=\r\n to get help on what kind of spiritual path is best for me and I can provid=\r\ne you my birth data if you are willing to help me. Currently I do certain t=\r\nhings like Sandhyavandanam, Rudra-abhishekam every monday (lord shiva is my=\r\n ishta devata), panchopachara puja everyday (almost). Sometimes I do Ganapa=\r\nthi Homam and Gayatri Homam as well. But I want to know if any of these or =\r\nsomething different / additional is better for me. Is there a way?\n\nRegards=\r\n,\n\nNagraj Kota \n  \n\n\n"}}
