I find=\r\n it difficult to  spare time (nearly 50 minutes) to do itmore often.\n\nOf la=\r\nte I have been reading up about Agnihotra. Once source says to do Agnihotra=\r\n at sunrise and sunset with the mantras uttered ONLY once each:\n\n1. Sury=E1=\r\nya Sw=E1h=E1\nSury=E1ya Idam Na Mama (offer ghee and uncooked rice in the fi=\r\nre).\n\n2. Praj=E1pataye Sw=E1h=E1 \nPraj=E1pataye Idam Na Mama (offer ghee an=\r\nd uncooked rice in the fire).\n\nThis should take all of 20 seconds to finish=\r\n the main agnihotra. Much more time it would take to set up, shower before =\r\netc.\n\nMy intention is to do Ganapathi homam on the weekends and Agnihotra a=\r\ns above weekdays.\n\nAm I getting this right? Learned members, please help me=\r\n get it right so that I can do it right.\n\nThanks for your advice\nRanga\n\n\n\n\n"}}
