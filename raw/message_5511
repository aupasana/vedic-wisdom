If you keep polluting the =\r\nlist with this attitude, I will have to ban you from the list. We welcome a=\r\nll views, but one can disagree with great scholars and masters without beli=\r\nttling them or adopting an all-knowing and dismissive attitude.\n \nAadi Shan=\r\nkara was not anti Veda or anti grammar. In fact, if you study his works, yo=\r\nu will be amazed at some of the subtle technical nusances in his commentari=\r\nes, w.r.t. grammar. In terms of Sanskrit scholarship, scholarship in Vedic =\r\nscriptures, breadth of commentaries of Vedic literature and the linguistic =\r\nrichness of compositions, Aadi Shankara stands tall among all scholars of K=\r\nali yuga so far. You cannot take one specific line about the importance of =\r\ndevotion out of context and portray the greatest and most prolific scholar =\r\nof Kali yuga in an anti-scholarship light.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSanskrit=\r\n is a very useful language. So much great literature that shows various pat=\r\nhs to reaching god is available in Sanskrit language. Many Sanskrit mantras=\r\n directly resonate with the energy centers in one&#39;s subtle consciousness. S=\r\no, if one wants to learn Sanskrit or study various scriptures/classics in S=\r\nanskrit, it is a great idea.\n \nAt the same time, Shankara&#39;s advice of chant=\r\ning the name of Govinda as grammar and other technicalities do not rescue o=\r\nne in the final moments, is a wise one. Devotion to personal god or *comple=\r\nte* surrender to personal or impersonal god is the thing that saves one in =\r\nthe end. Learning various shastras, performing various rituals, disciplinin=\r\ng the mind with various activities, keeping the company of the saintly - al=\r\nl these are for the purpose of increasing devotion and surrender. Depending=\r\n on one&#39;s rinas and conditioning, one is bound to engage in various activit=\r\nies, such as learning Sanskrit, studying scriptures, saying prayers, doing =\r\nrituals etc. But, masters like Shankara remind one of the final goal, so th=\r\nat people do not forget it and get bogged down.\n \nIf one wanting to climb a=\r\n mountain keeps walking around the mountain to find the best path to climb,=\r\n one may eventually forget that the goal is to climb the mountain and be st=\r\nuck at the base forever. Similarly, one who keeps learning this and that fo=\r\nrever may forget that reaching god is the final goal and get stuck. So comp=\r\nassionate masters may sometimes remind us of the final goal.\n \n*        *  =\r\n      *\n \nI am reminded of a small episode from the life of Swami Vivekanan=\r\nda.\n \nSwami Vivekananda said at a San Francisco class: &quot;I am the disciple o=\r\nf a man who could not write his own name, and I am not worthy to undo his s=\r\nhoes. How often have I wished I could take my intellect and throw it into t=\r\nhe Ganges!&quot;\n \nStudent said, &quot;But, Swami, that is the part of you I like bes=\r\nt.&quot;\n \nSwami Vivekananda said, &quot;That is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=80=\r\n=94 like I am.&quot;\n \nVivekananda was named so by Ramakrishna, not because he h=\r\nad viveka (discrimination) arising from a brilliant logical mind, but becau=\r\nse TRUE viveka (discrimination) was to arise in his mind later and he was t=\r\no realize the limitations of his regular viveka (discrimination of logical =\r\nmind).\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; That Adi shankara is celebrated in a relat=\r\nively few quarters around the world,\n&gt; does speak a lot about his immaturit=\r\ny in disseminating his teachings in a\n&gt; useful manner.\n \nMaturity of a teac=\r\nher is not measured by the following. And great teachers do not care about =\r\nbeing &quot;celebrated&quot;.\n \nIn any case, it is not true that Adi Shankara is not =\r\nwell-celebrated. A significant percentage of Vedanta scholarship of the las=\r\nt 2 millennia is influenced heavily by Adi Shankara&#39;s commentaries. He shap=\r\ned the thinking of Indian philosophers for many many generations.\n \nApart f=\r\nrom his scholarly works, the mutts established by him have shaped the relig=\r\nious consciousness of a significant percentage of Hindus in the last couple=\r\n of millennia.\n \nAny teachings in written/spoken words can never be perfect=\r\n and perish quickly. The words of great great teachers also lose their mean=\r\ning and relevance very quickly. Only the teachings of rishis and gods retai=\r\nn their meaning and their ability to influence the thinking of people forev=\r\ner (or for really long periods). Adi Shankara&#39;s words - scholarly works as =\r\nwell as composed prayers - have retained their meaning and power for more t=\r\nhan a couple of millennia. The longevity of his works is amazing.\n \n*      =\r\n  *        *\n \nIt is ok to have strong opinions. As people&#39;s understanding =\r\nevolves, their opinions evolve too. So, wise ones try not to offend others =\r\nwith their strong opinions. In any case, insulting saints, avataras of gods=\r\n and rishis, based on half-baked understanding of their teachings, is not g=\r\nood karma. I request members to be considerate, tolerant and respectful to =\r\nothers.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, J=\r\nyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri =\r\nTarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that m=\r\nake a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings\n----------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n \n---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; Namaskar smartxpark,\n&gt; What you say is correct, Sanskrit and its grammar=\r\n gives one a high that other languages do not. It is because the Beeja vibr=\r\nations resonate with the astral centers. The secret lies in choosing the ri=\r\nght beeja for the recitation of mantras and commune with divinities of the =\r\ncreation. There is only one right beeja for one person, amongst the 49 beej=\r\nakshara from HaM to SaM constituting 49 Maruts or astral-life currents, tha=\r\nt allows a person to contact the divinities.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is always useful to pro=\r\ngress on the most reasonable path of ones&#39; own choosing because that would =\r\nsafeguard one from failures and pitfalls created by others&#39; immature advice=\r\n.\n&gt; That Adi shankara is celebrated in a relatively few quarters around the=\r\n world, does speak a lot about his immaturity in disseminating his teaching=\r\ns in a useful manner.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are people who are stupid enough to call th=\r\ne Path/Goal of others as wrong, without trying to understand why they are o=\r\nn that path in the first place. It is important to safeguard oneself from t=\r\nhese people, who act as leaders to an emaciated (spiritually, mentally) fol=\r\nlowing, because they feed their following on words & preachings rather than=\r\n Action and Knowledge.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is always useful to stand apart from the herd=\r\n mentality on yahoogroups, because that would allow one to see farther than=\r\n the group and move towards Vedas i.e. a universal approach to evolution.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; You are on a better path studying and enjoying sanksrit, as a Vedanga, h=\r\nowever, sanskrit is only a tool that should be used as a language of mantra=\r\ns for resonating ones&#39; being with the 27 divinities enumerated in Jyotish (=\r\nanother Vedanga) as the Devas of 27 Nakshatra, in accordance with the &quot;Rule=\r\ns of Worship&quot; set by RigVeda. The truth of being is more likely to be found=\r\n there than anywhere else including the writings of likes of Adi Shankara.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Aryama\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Nagraj Kota =\r\n&lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; history teaches us that people who made idio=\r\nts of themselves by criticizing noblest of the souls will be forgotten and/=\r\nor not even acknowledged in their own times!\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; please evaluat=\r\ne who you are before you go ahead and state that &quot;.....Should Adishankara m=\r\nanifest himself before a MERE you.........................&quot; !
