For the past few years, I have been feeling hindered in my spiritua=\r\nl progress due to the feel of the sacred thread on my body during my sadhan=\r\na. In fact, from as far back as I can remember, I have been averse to weari=\r\nng any metal on self, having been very sensitive to any prolonged foreign t=\r\nouch on my body. I have experimented with removing my thread during sadhana=\r\n and I find increased levels of consciousness and &#39;going within&#39; through en=\r\nhanced focus and concentration due to lesser distraction and irritation. Ha=\r\ns anyone experienced something like this? Why is this so? Is it only physio=\r\nlogical in origin or is there something more to it?\n&gt; \n \n\n\n"}}
