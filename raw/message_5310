Of course, Krishna paksha Ashtami day in all months is auspicious for worshipping Kaala Bhairava. But this one is special.\n \nRegarding Yantras (in general):\n \nJust as containers of different shapes are optimal for storing different materials, similarly different yantras are optimal for storing spiritual energy of different kinds. However, please note that someone has to get milk and pour it in a container, for a container designed for milk to have milk in it! Similarly, someone has to do enough sadhana using a yantra to store some spiritual shakti in it. One usually cannot expect to buy a yantra that is already charged with spiritual energy.\n \nRegarding havan:\n \nA detailed manual of &quot;Kaala Bhairava Homam&quot; can be downloaded at the homam website (see link below in my signature). Using it, anybody can perform a homam by oneself. Many common questions are addressed within the manual.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;krishnaastro2003&quot; &lt;krishnaastro2003@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; KAALBHAIRAV JAYANTI coming on 28th november, 2010 kalastami very auspicious day for worship of KAALBHAIRAV.\n&gt; We are going to perform special hawan on KAALBHAIRAV JAYANTI with holy herbs things n chants and will enrgise\n&gt; special sidha bhairav yantra for complete protection purpose anyone want to get the special sidha bhairava yantra can write us \n&gt; on rohitjivani@... or www.astroprayer.com\n\n\n"}}
