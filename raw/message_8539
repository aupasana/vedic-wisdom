I am in agreement with this way =\r\nof looking at Moksha,\n&gt; theoretically speaking.\n&gt;\n&gt; In many of our Vedanta =\r\nliterature Moska is said to be freedom from\n&gt; rebirth. That is what I can&#39;t=\r\n agree to theoretically, at least at this\n&gt; moment.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is there any stoppi=\r\nng from coming back? There is an small but interesting\n&gt; incident in the Ra=\r\nmayana which illustrates what I was trying to say.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the appointed hou=\r\nr, it was time for Rama to die. But the god of death\n&gt; could not enter Rama=\r\n&#39;s city as Hanumana with his yogic prowess guarded the\n&gt; gates of the city.=\r\n Hanumana loved Rama so much that he did not want Rama to\n&gt; die. To distrac=\r\nt Hanumana and let Nature take its course, Rama dropped his\n&gt; ring through =\r\na crack in the floor and asked Hanumana to go and fetch it.\n&gt; The crack led=\r\n Hanumana to the subterranean realm where he found countless\n&gt; number of ex=\r\nactly similar looking rings. Vasuki, the serpent-king, and\n&gt; guarding of th=\r\ne subterranean realm explained, &quot;Whenever a ring falls here,\n&gt; a Hanumana f=\r\nollows it and we know it is time for a Rama to leave his body.\n&gt; Such rings=\r\n have fallen from above as long as I can remember, and will\n&gt; continue to d=\r\no so in future. As long as the wheel of existence rotates, old\n&gt; worlds die=\r\n and new ones are reborn.

I am doing=\r\n fine and I hope you are doing fine\n&gt; too.\n&gt;\n&gt; Disagreements and difference=\r\n of view-points are absolutely fine, afterall\n&gt; in ancient India from the m=\r\nonotheists to the atheists, we had every breed\n&gt; coexisting. Having said th=\r\nat, I will explain a few of the points you have\n&gt; raised in your email, fro=\r\nm my perspective of course.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt; You have to complete the story.&gt;.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; The reason I cannot add anything more to it is because the individual\n&gt;=\r\n himself did not reveal anything more about this.  For me, the incidents he=\r\n\n&gt; revealed hold an interesting view-point and a value on its own . When I\n=\r\n&gt; mention any such story I only narrate the same exactly as it is, without\n=\r\n&gt; adding  or subtracting anything from it. Conclusions, whatever they maybe=\r\n,\n&gt; have to be drawn by every individual. Some may reject it, some may acce=\r\npt\n&gt; it, both of which are fine.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt; This story seems to like I used  =\r\nto read in Chandamama. This guy\n&gt; Iyengar seems to be a siddha if the  stor=\r\ny so far is true.and he has the\n&gt; ability to shape shift and transportation=\r\n. So what?? But he still needs his\n&gt; daily fix of bhang.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As per the T=\r\nantric scriptures, even Lord Shiva in his form of Bhairava\n&gt; smokes ganja, =\r\ndrinks alcohol, eats with dogs and chandalas, roams around\n&gt; naked in the s=\r\nmashana. So is taking intoxicants a sufficient criteria to\n&gt; judge anyone&#39;s=\r\n spirituality? Not for me!\n&gt;\n&gt; ,\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;&lt;what does God mean in this tale? &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I will tell you how I see it. In this story, God means infinity. Now =\r\nwhat\n&gt; is infinity? It cannot be described, it cannot be named, it cannot b=\r\ne\n&gt; understood using the five sense organs. Science does not understand\n&gt; i=\r\nnfinity, art does not understand infinity, nothing or nobody  understands\n&gt;=\r\n infinity. It is a summation of all that we know, all that we can  imagine\n=\r\n&gt; and all that is impossible for us to imagine. It is an incomprehensible\n&gt;=\r\n force that runs through everything, from the most loveable to the most\n&gt; d=\r\nespicable , from the most holy to the most unholy, from the greatest saint\n=\r\n&gt; to the stupidest piece of rock at the bottom of the deepest ocean in the\n=\r\n&gt; farthest planet in the farthest solar system in the farthest universe.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Now question is, can an average human being &quot;know&quot; this mysterious an=\r\nd all\n&gt; pervading force? Knowing implies understanding. Clearly no. Then ho=\r\nw does\n&gt; one interact with such a thing? One way is to consider everything,=\r\n and I\n&gt; mean EVERYTHING from living to non-living, as a manifestation of t=\r\nhat force\n&gt; and thus learn to love the same unconditionally without expecti=\r\nng anything\n&gt; in return. No wonder such unconditional love is not easy. It =\r\nneeds\n&gt; tremendous effort to change our own conditioning of the mind, and w=\r\nork on\n&gt; our inherent biases and prejudices. That is what the  aim of sadha=\r\nna is, in\n&gt; my view. To work on oneself, to make one ready to be able to\n&gt; =\r\nunconditionally love everything. The greater number of entities one can\n&gt; l=\r\nove unconditionally, that much little bit closer one can come to\n&gt; interact=\r\ning with the truly infinite. And those few rare human beings who\n&gt; can love=\r\n a whole universe unconditionally, are possibly the closest to this\n&gt; supre=\r\nme and unknowable force. In common language, we call them Rishis.\n&gt;\n&gt; I lik=\r\ne all forms of Deities, for I find something beautiful in everyone of\n&gt; the=\r\nm. And I also like the One behind forms, which is so perfectly\n&gt; transcende=\r\nntal that it cannot be comprehended ever. It&#39;s like the surface\n&gt; area of t=\r\nhe fine tip of a needle, or the gap between the two breaths, or\n&gt; the milli=\r\nonth part of a single hair, or the endless-ness of space, or the\n&gt; bottomle=\r\nss well of stillness in the mind at certain points in meditation.\n&gt; The onl=\r\ny thing that stops me from getting a better understanding the\n&gt; grandeur of=\r\n  this formless entity are the limitations of my own mind and\n&gt; body, that =\r\nI have acquired over millions of births. That is why Sadhana. To\n&gt; slowly g=\r\nnaw away at my own mind, to be better able to appreciate this\n&gt; endless, na=\r\nmeless entity. G_d.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I do not believe in Moksha. What is Moksha? No re=\r\nbirth? If the Universe\n&gt; itself gets born over and over and over, if Rama a=\r\nnd Krshna come back at\n&gt; every cycle, who am I to demand that I should not =\r\nget born? Infact, when a\n&gt; person proverbially finishes off his/her karmas,=\r\n they merely go to another\n&gt; plane in this Universe and stay there for eons=\r\n of time, since time anyway\n&gt; moves very, very slowly in different realms. =\r\nBut then, if this force so\n&gt; wants, it can send back any of the souls from =\r\nany of the realms to any of\n&gt; the other realms to serve a certain function.=\r\n And if a soul stays in a\n&gt; certain higher realm and in forced to take rebi=\r\nrth again, the seeds of the\n&gt; karmas - which never really die off - are  wa=\r\ntered again by the environment\n&gt; of birth and they sprout into saplings. An=\r\nd this may go even beyond one\n&gt; cycle of creation. Else why would Krshna an=\r\nd Arjuna fight the very same\n&gt; enemies that they had been fighting in the p=\r\nast cycle of creation?\n&gt; Mahabharata says so. I believe it.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What th=\r\nen is the final aim of all this, spirituality etc? I don&#39;t know.\n&gt; Maybe, t=\r\no teach us to broaden our perspectives and consequentially lessen\n&gt; our att=\r\nachments to our otherwise mundane lives and its mundane problems.\n&gt; This is=\r\n like a circular roller-coaster ride we see in local melas. Tighten\n&gt; the s=\r\neat-belts, bring a smile in the heart, be detached and enjoy the show!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Best of luck and take good care of yourself!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | *\n&gt; *param bhAwamaj=\r\nAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24] *\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; _______________________________=\r\n____**\n&gt;\n&gt; *From: *Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt;\n&gt; *To: *&quot;vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;  &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; *Sent: *Saturda=\r\ny, 28 July 2012 7:30 PM\n&gt; *Subject: *Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say th=\r\nat they don=92t believe in\n&gt; any religion\n&gt;\n&gt;   Dear Rajarshi Bhai,\n&gt; How a=\r\nre you? You have to complete the story. you have to tell what\n&gt; happened wh=\r\nen X went to meet this man in temple.or anything else which\n&gt; happened. It =\r\nis like somebody gone in kitchen to get rest of meal and not\n&gt; come back.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; First I have to thank you for writing that story about Divine Mother S=\r\nri\n&gt; Chinnmastaji. I had developed a fear about Her but 3 times I got spiri=\r\ntual\n&gt; indications over the period of 2 months that I should write my story=\r\n. When\n&gt; you wrote back suddenly my fear about Her melted away and I did im=\r\nmediate\n&gt; prayers to Her. Thanks.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The other thing is can I dare to sa=\r\ny that I do not agree what is in this\n&gt; thread. Why does this so called spi=\r\nritual man has to dump his failure on\n&gt; religion. If people do not believe =\r\nin religion or God or afterlife, it is\n&gt; their problem. We are not all equa=\r\nl. We all do not come from same stock. We\n&gt; are born with different conditi=\r\nons, go through different life experiences\n&gt; and go where our fate or desti=\r\nny takes us. This world is composed of 3\n&gt; gunas and there is always going =\r\nto tension of different sort. Why  blame it\n&gt; on religion or God, why not o=\r\nn greed and desire to control others and lord\n&gt; over them using what ever m=\r\nean.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; This story seems to like I used to read in Chandamama. This guy =\r\nIyengar\n&gt; seems to be a siddha if the story so far is true.and he has the a=\r\nbility to\n&gt; shape shift and transportation. So what?? But he still needs hi=\r\ns daily fix\n&gt; of bhang.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; what does God mean in this tale? Is it Creato=\r\nr God or Divine Lord Of Sri\n&gt; Vrindavan or   Divine  Mother or  Self Realis=\r\nation or Universal God or\n&gt; Jewish God or Formless God or Fire God?? After =\r\nall there was a dhoni fire\n&gt; there? Or some other God ??\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Vrindava=\r\nn has a rolling population. They are not in confusion. Many\n&gt; people come t=\r\nhere only for curiosity, many other come only for Darshan in\n&gt; the Temple a=\r\nnd go back home happy. many others come with different desires.\n&gt; It is ver=\r\ny wrong to expect from a person who is in fifth grade to have\n&gt; knowledge o=\r\nf 15th grade.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Many times people go to temple to pray and ask for cert=\r\nain things and if\n&gt; it does not happen they become very anti religion and a=\r\nnti God. So what??\n&gt; It has nothing to do with me or you or anybody else. I=\r\nt is their life.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I was very very very ill. Nobody was helping me. Man=\r\ny people were giving\n&gt; me lot of pain.   I went  from Religious place to re=\r\nligious place, temple\n&gt; to temple, holy man to holy man. Nothing seem to wo=\r\nrked. Then I took up\n&gt; religious practise of doing mantra japa and other th=\r\nings which are in\n&gt; scriptures and Grace of Divine Mother it worked. It is =\r\ntotally religious\n&gt; discipline according to our scriptures.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Do you dr=\r\nive a car? Did you pass you exam first time? I do not drive a\n&gt; car. It wil=\r\nl take me several exams to pass it. Many people pass their test\n&gt; first tim=\r\ne and drive successfully. Does it mean I should blame car or exams\n&gt; or exa=\r\nminer or road for my failure??? .Many people take up spiritual life\n&gt; and i=\r\nf they do not find success quickly they blame religion and God.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I als=\r\no used to think that a real experience of God would be very powerful\n&gt; thin=\r\ng. but there are other aspects to it. If  someone is totally  dependent\n&gt; o=\r\nn Divine Mother and calls on Her day and night, but yet he is not ready\n&gt; f=\r\nor certain energy or his body is not clean enough to receive a new light,\n&gt;=\r\n then Divine Mother would appear to him in very gentle way to comfort him\n&gt;=\r\n and to console so that he remains on the path. She will appear right in\n&gt; =\r\nfront of him but he only sees the Golden Aura and not what is middle of it\n=\r\n&gt; because he is not yet ready. Whenever I think of that moment I am filled\n=\r\n&gt; with deep bliss and joy and wonderment.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; You are a special person do=\r\ning everyday intense haven to spread the\n&gt; light.Many other people in this =\r\ngroup are doing haven everyday to fill\n&gt; their life with light of Divine Be=\r\nings. This is a complete religious method\n&gt; which is also totally spiritual=\r\n thing.Please do not get impressed with\n&gt; pseudo spiritual talk and tales o=\r\nf shape shifting. Is everything alright in\n&gt; your everyday life because I f=\r\nelt a sadness in your mail? I am sure I am\n&gt; very wrong in  this.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Few=\r\n days ago Olympic flame passed right outside my road.I did not go out\n&gt; to =\r\nsee it.

Heavy psychological\n&gt; constructs are created by religions to pr=\r\notect an average person from the\n&gt; real experience of God, which is so powe=\r\nrful and overwhelming that if and\n&gt; when it happens, it can effectively cau=\r\nse a hurricane in your average life\n&gt; and pretty much destroy all your well=\r\n laid plans.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I will briefly narrate a true and interesting incident=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; An individual - say X - had gone to Vrindavan to  stay there for =\r\nsome\n&gt; years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying the\n&gt;=\r\n discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing unblinking eyes, comes=\r\n\n&gt; over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at the satsang, stop=\r\nped\n&gt; and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the ragged looking man. =\r\nThen\n&gt; he did a pranam to the man and said, &quot;Maharaj, please tell us some w=\r\nords of\n&gt; God&quot;. The man became angry, and retorted back, &quot;Why? Why waste ti=\r\nme talking\n&gt; of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all will run aw=\r\nay. So please\n&gt; continue with your lectures as you were doing before I came=\r\n in&quot;. Everyone\n&gt; became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the sw=\r\neets came, the\n&gt; man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky and =\r\nthen got up and\n&gt; started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who was=\r\n lecturing, looked\n&gt; at his followers and said, &quot;He is a sadhu who comes to=\r\n Vrindavan once in a\n&gt; while, but he has probably lost his mental balance d=\r\nue to smoking too much\n&gt; ganja&quot;. Now X, who was sitting there, for some wei=\r\nrd reason felt attracted\n&gt; to that ragged man and went out to see where the=\r\n guy was going. As he\n&gt; approached the ragged looking man, the man turned a=\r\nround and spoke to X in\n&gt; clear English, &quot;Hello, I was waiting for you to c=\r\nome and join me.&quot; X was of\n&gt; course taken aback, did not expect the man to =\r\nspeak in English and more\n&gt; over he had no clue how the man got to know tha=\r\nt he knew English (X was\n&gt; dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes=\r\n).\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The man continued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chenn=\r\nai, was an\n&gt; Engineer by profession, but left home long back and have been =\r\na wondering\n&gt; sadhu since then.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu =\r\nwho was doing\n&gt; the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actual=\r\nly this God\n&gt; thing itself is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. N=\r\not the hordes\n&gt; of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is th=\r\ne reason for\n&gt; all  the religious troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a li=\r\nttle irritated,\n&gt; &quot;Why do you have so much bitterness about religion/God/sa=\r\ndhus etc? If you\n&gt; have been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven&#39;t me=\r\nt a single genuine\n&gt; sadhu yet, how is it possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;=\r\nWell if I take\n&gt; Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine man here, rest =\r\nare all as\n&gt; confused as anybody else, merely different degrees of confusio=\r\nn. But you\n&gt; cannot meet that man, he is not accessible to others.&quot; Mr Iyen=\r\ngar\n&gt; continued, &quot;The root of all this problem is this God business. Know i=\r\nt for\n&gt; certain, that man cannot know God ever. What is infinite is beyond =\r\nthe\n&gt; capacity of the human brain to comprehend. At best a man will only im=\r\nagine\n&gt; a magnified man or a magnified woman with super-powers. If the indi=\r\nvidual\n&gt; keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create this form by a project=\r\nion of\n&gt; his own mind, and he may even acquire supernatural abilities from =\r\nthis\n&gt; form, and generally be regarded  by others as a man of god. But God =\r\nis\n&gt; beyond this. That is why I say the root of the problem is trying to\n&gt; =\r\nunderstand the infinite with a finite mind and then stressing that one has\n=\r\n&gt; understood correctly.&quot; While talking, the sadhu stopped at a small\n&gt; tea-=\r\nstall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off the chillum.\n&gt; Th=\r\nen held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing the\n&gt; =\r\nsmoke in small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You (meaning X) are a young man.\n&gt;=\r\n Have a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t get confused by all these show of\n&gt; =\r\nspirituality you see in holy places. When I was your age, I did a lot of\n&gt; =\r\nterrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infamous young\n&gt; =\r\nman in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day having\n&gt; n=\r\nothing better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly\n&gt; r=\r\nealized what God really is and how to interact with this thing.&quot; As he\n&gt; sp=\r\noke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a  young girl\n&gt; ca=\r\nme out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said\n&gt; t=\r\no X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so when I come to\n&gt; Vr=\r\nindavan I stay at their house. I will show you something interesting if\n&gt; y=\r\nou join me.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; After an hour inside the house, X was feeling very bore=\r\nd and irritated.\n&gt; The woman was bringing different fruits and sweets for t=\r\nheir food while the\n&gt; young girl was massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s feet as he lay =\r\ndown on a cot,\n&gt; enjoying the hospitality. X thought this man is one more f=\r\nraud, he abuses\n&gt; everyone else but has no qualms about shamelessly accepti=\r\nng the hospitality\n&gt; of a householder and enjoying a good life. As soon as =\r\nthis thought crossed\n&gt; his mind, he saw that the man and the woman and the =\r\ngirl  stood up and with\n&gt; folded hands were bowing down towards the cot whe=\r\nre Mr Iyengar was lying\n&gt; down. X was sitting on the floor, facing the opp =\r\ndirection to the cot. He\n&gt; too turned round to see  what was going on. What=\r\n he saw made his jaw drop\n&gt; open in shock. Instead of the old, bald, ragged=\r\n beggar that was Mr Iyengar,\n&gt; there sat on the cot a young man, who looked=\r\n in his early twenties, whose\n&gt; whole skin was dazzlingly fair, emanating a=\r\n brilliant glow that lightened\n&gt; up the whole room. He had a shaved head, f=\r\nour arms, holding lotus and\n&gt; weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eyes! It=\r\n looked not a human being any\n&gt; more but a god sitting in place of what was=\r\n even five minutes back only a\n&gt; frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; X=\r\n did not know what was happening. He saw the young man gestured towards\n&gt; h=\r\nim to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotized, X got up and\n&gt;=\r\n walked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X lost all\n&gt; consci=\r\nousness. When he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a remote\n&gt; locati=\r\non with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, held\n&gt; his =\r\nhand and took him inside the temple precincts.  There he saw a dhuni\n&gt; burn=\r\ning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash\n&gt; all=\r\n over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that\n&gt; meditatin=\r\ng man to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I\n&gt; was tal=\r\nking about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only\n&gt; one in =\r\nVrindavan currently who has an idea what God really means. After\n&gt; providin=\r\ng directions of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar\n&gt; hugged X ag=\r\nain and immediately he felt he was losing awareness of\n&gt; place/time and lap=\r\nsed into unconsciousness again.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; When X woke up, he was in the room =\r\nin that house, lying on the floor. Mr\n&gt; Iyengar was on the bed, his old, ra=\r\ngged self, with a mischievous smile on\n&gt; his face. Next day, X went to the =\r\ntemple as directed.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *awaktam wyaktimAp=\r\nannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah | *\n&gt; *param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttama=\r\nm ||[7:24] *\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ___________________________________**\n&gt;\n&gt; *From: *Ajit K=\r\nrishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\n&gt; *To: *vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; *S=\r\nent: *Monday, 23 July 2012  8:13 AM\n&gt; *Subject: *Re: [vedic-wisdom] To thos=\r\ne who say that they don=92t believe in\n&gt; any religion\n&gt;\n&gt;   Dear Prasanth,\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To those who say that they don=92t believe in any religion\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; In general, many of those who don&#39;t believe in religion or God are being\n=\r\n&gt; more honest than those who do. After all, most people who believe in God\n=\r\n&gt; look at him as a limited being to barter with. All of our biases and\n&gt; as=\r\nsumptions are most apparent when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion\n&gt; h=\r\nas simply served to formalize these biases.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; While being mired in this=\r\n word of duality, we think that an ounce of\n&gt; insincere prayer can undo the=\r\n whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in\n&gt; throughout the day. And we lay=\r\n this bias on our God. No wonder that others\n&gt; look at all the suffering in=\r\n the world and laugh at this concept of God. We\n&gt; &quot;God believers&quot; are the c=\r\nulprit.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; We all have plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipeline.=\r\n Instead of\n&gt; asking for the strength to be steadfast while we reap both ki=\r\nnds of fruits,\n&gt; we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and leave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. I=\r\nt is us &quot;God\n&gt; believers&quot; who look at our lives, ignoring all the &quot;paapa ph=\r\nala&quot;. We look\n&gt; at one or two instances of &quot;punya phala&quot; and declare our pr=\r\nayers to be\n&gt; successful. However, an impartial observer sees it for what i=\r\nt is, and\n&gt; laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; For the=\r\n most part, our bhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual\n&gt; practice=\r\ns, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we count the seconds and\n&gt; minutes.=\r\n When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time\n&gt; really =\r\nflies. And yet, we expect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti\n&gt; and ign=\r\nore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial observer sees it for\n&gt; what it =\r\nis, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The best wa=\r\ny to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at the\n&gt; &quot;non-believers=\r\n&quot; and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to\n&gt; eliminate our lack=\r\n of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can\n&gt; transform ourselves, =\r\nthe world will be served.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; If we see God as the limitless power that h=\r\ne is, he is difficult to\n&gt; define. It is difficult to capture him within a =\r\nreligion. Religion should\n&gt; see itself as a stepping-stone, and should ask =\r\neach of us to _eventually_\n&gt; place our feet on top of it to reach the highe=\r\nr goals. Unfortunately, most\n&gt; religions ask us to accept them without ques=\r\ntion. They ask us to place our\n&gt; heads on them with reverence, and try to p=\r\nrevent the spiritually advanced\n&gt; from going any farther.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; sasneham,\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;    ajit\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;http://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n\r\n--f46d044304eec0f9e904c60b189b\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nDear Rajarshi,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:verdana,helveti=\r\nca,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:small&quot;&gt;&gt; Whenever=\r\n a ring falls here,=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:verdana,helvet=\r\nica,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:small&quot;&gt;&gt; a Han=\r\numana follows it and we know=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:verda=\r\nna,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:small&quot;&gt;&gt=\r\n; it is time for a Rama to leave his body.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Even if the play goes on, different actors may=\r\n play the part.

Hanumana loved Rama so much =\r\nthat he did not want \nRama to die. To distract Hanumana and let Nature take=\r\n its course, Rama \ndropped his ring through a crack in the floor and asked =\r\nHanumana to go \nand fetch it.

In this story, God means=\r\n infinity. Now what is infinity? It cannot be described, it cannot be named=\r\n, it cannot be understood using the five sense organs. Science does not und=\r\nerstand infinity, art\n does not understand infinity, nothing or nobody=A0 u=\r\nnderstands infinity. It is a summation of all that we know, all that we can=\r\n=A0 imagine and all that is impossible for us to imagine. It is an incompre=\r\nhensible force that runs through everything, from the most loveable to the =\r\nmost despicable , from the most holy to the most unholy, from the greatest =\r\nsaint to the stupidest piece of rock at the bottom of the deepest ocean in =\r\nthe farthest planet in the farthest solar system in the farthest universe. =\r\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font si=\r\nze=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000=\r\n00&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=\r\n=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;Now question is, can an average human being &=\r\nquot;know&quot; this mysterious and all pervading force? Knowing implies un=\r\nderstanding. Clearly no. Then how does one interact with such a thing? One =\r\nway is to consider\n everything, and I mean EVERYTHING from living to non-li=\r\nving, as a manifestation of that force and thus learn to love the same unco=\r\nnditionally without expecting anything in return. No wonder such unconditio=\r\nnal love is not easy. It needs tremendous effort to change our own conditio=\r\nning of the mind, and work on our inherent biases and prejudices. That is w=\r\nhat the=A0 aim of sadhana is, in my view. To work on oneself, to make one r=\r\neady to be able to unconditionally love everything. The greater number of e=\r\nntities one can love unconditionally, that much little bit closer one can c=\r\nome to interacting with the truly infinite. And those few rare human beings=\r\n who can love a whole universe unconditionally, are possibly the closest to=\r\n this supreme and unknowable force. In common language, we call them Rishis=\r\n. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\nfont&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana=\r\n&quot;&gt;I like all forms of\n Deities, for I find something beautiful in everyone =\r\nof them. And I also like the One behind forms, which is so perfectly transc=\r\nendental that it cannot be comprehended ever. It&#39;s like the surface are=\r\na of the fine tip of a needle, or the gap between the two breaths, or the m=\r\nillionth part of a single hair, or the endless-ness of space, or the bottom=\r\nless well of stillness in the mind at certain points in meditation. The onl=\r\ny thing that stops me from getting a better understanding the grandeur of=\r\n=A0 this formless entity are the limitations of my own mind and body, that =\r\nI have acquired over millions of births. That is why Sadhana. To slowly gna=\r\nw away at my own mind, to be better able to appreciate this endless, namele=\r\nss entity. G_d. &lt;font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#0000=\r\n00&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Ver=\r\ndana&quot;&gt;I do not\n believe in Moksha. What is Moksha? No rebirth? If the Unive=\r\nrse itself gets born over and over and over, if Rama and Krshna come back a=\r\nt every cycle, who am I to demand that I should not get born? Infact, when =\r\na person proverbially finishes off his/her karmas, they merely go to anothe=\r\nr plane in this Universe and stay there for eons of time, since time anyway=\r\n moves very, very slowly in different realms. But then, if this force so wa=\r\nnts, it can send back any of the souls from any of the realms to any of the=\r\n other realms to serve a certain function. And if a soul stays in a certain=\r\n higher realm and in forced to take rebirth again, the seeds of the karmas =\r\n- which never really die off - are=A0 watered again by the environment of b=\r\nirth and they sprout into saplings. And this may go even beyond one cycle o=\r\nf creation. Else why would Krshna and Arjuna fight the very same enemies th=\r\nat they had been fighting in the past cycle of creation? Mahabharata says s=\r\no. I\n believe it. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font s=\r\nize=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;What then is the final aim of =\r\nall this, spirituality etc?

He was sitting at a=\r\n satsang of a famous sadhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged looking m=\r\nan, with piercing unblinking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The sadhu =\r\nwho was lecturing at the satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bring some=\r\n sweets for the ragged looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man and sai=\r\nd, &quot;Maharaj, please tell us some words of God&quot;. The man became an=\r\ngry, and retorted back, &quot;Why? Why waste time talking of God, no one wa=\r\nnts God anyway. If God comes, all will run away. So please\n continue with y=\r\nour lectures as you were doing before I came in&quot;. Everyone became unco=\r\nmfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the sweets came, the man took a sw=\r\neet into his mouth, looked up at the sky and then got up and started walkin=\r\ng off. After he went out, the Sadhu who was lecturing, looked at his follow=\r\ners and said, &quot;He is a sadhu who comes to Vrindavan once in a while, b=\r\nut he has probably lost his mental balance due to smoking too much=A0 ganja=\r\n&quot;. Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird reason felt attracted =\r\nto that ragged man and went out to see where the guy was going. As he appro=\r\nached the ragged looking man, the man turned around and spoke to X in clear=\r\n English, &quot;Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join me.&quot; X w=\r\nas of course taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in English and mo=\r\nre over he had no clue how the man got to know that he knew English (X was =\r\ndressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;font col=\r\nor=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;=\r\n face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/f=\r\nont&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;=\r\n&gt;The man continued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, w=\r\nas an Engineer by profession, but left home long back and have been a wonde=\r\nring sadhu since then.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who =\r\nwas doing the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actuall=\r\ny this God thing itself is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not =\r\nthe hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the rea=\r\nson for all=A0 the religious troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a li=\r\nttle irritated, &quot;Why do you have so much bitterness about religion/God=\r\n/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven&#39=\r\n;t met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar re=\r\nplied, &quot;Well if I take\n Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine man=\r\n here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, merely different degrees o=\r\nf confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not accessible to others.&=\r\nquot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;The root of all this problem is this God =\r\nbusiness. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God ever. What is infin=\r\nite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend. At best a man =\r\nwill only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman with super-powers. I=\r\nf the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create this form by a=\r\n projection of his own mind, and he may even acquire supernatural abilities=\r\n from this form, and generally be regarded=A0 by others as a man of god. Bu=\r\nt God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the problem is trying t=\r\no understand the infinite with a finite mind and then stressing that one ha=\r\ns understood correctly.&quot; While talking, the sadhu stopped at a small t=\r\nea-stall and bought some ganja,\n and in one pull finished off the chillum. =\r\nThen held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing the =\r\nsmoke in small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You (meaning X) are a young m=\r\nan. Have a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t get confused by all these sho=\r\nw of spirituality you see in holy places. When I was your age, I did a lot =\r\nof terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infamous young=\r\n man in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day having no=\r\nthing better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly real=\r\nized what God really is and how to interact with this thing.&quot; As he sp=\r\noke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a=A0 young girl ca=\r\nme out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said to =\r\nX, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vrinda=\r\nvan I stay at their house. I will show you something interesting if you joi=\r\nn me. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#=\r\n000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot; colo=\r\nr=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;After an hour inside the house, X was feelin=\r\ng very bored and irritated.
