It is indeed one of the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; cornerstones of Sanskrit that a consonan=\r\nt cannot exist by itself and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; its life is given by the Vowel. But for =\r\nwhatever reason in Hindi they \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mostly avoid ending vowels. They carry =\r\nthat habit to other languages \n&gt; &gt;&gt; as well and recently I heard one of the=\r\n North Indian bhajan singers \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (I don&#39;t know the name) singing Adi Sank=\r\nara&#39;s Bhaja Govindam as &quot;Bhaj \n&gt; &gt;&gt; govindam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam,=\r\n moodh matE&quot;, which sounded \n&gt; &gt;&gt; quite odd to me! And they take that appro=\r\nach to languages like Braj \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Bhasha and Avadhi as well. For instance, f=\r\nor them &quot;Ramacharita \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Manasa&quot; is more important than even Valmiki&#39;s Ra=\r\nmayana. Yet they \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pronounce Avadhi also without proper vowel endings. =\r\nHowever, I have a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; strong feeling that, that approach is incorrect. In=\r\n avadhi, a chowpai \n&gt; &gt;&gt; like &quot;Sri Gurucharana\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Saroja\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; raja&quot;=\r\n should be pronounced exactly like that and not like &quot;Sri\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Gurucharan s=\r\naroj raj&quot;.

Having devotion and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; the spirit of surrender to god is even more important. However, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pro=\r\nnunciation is a factor too. Especially, correct pronunciation is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; very=\r\n important in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mantra \n&gt; &gt;&gt; can =\r\nstop one from the most complete experience of the mantra. In \n&gt; &gt;&gt; fact, we=\r\n have a lot of people who can memorize and repeat Veda \n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantras, but v=\r\nery few who can actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Over th=\r\ne next few months, I will write my views on correct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; pronunciation and =\r\npoint out some common errors. If you do not think \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that correct pronun=\r\nciation is important or if you disagree with my \n&gt; &gt;&gt; assessment of the err=\r\nors or if you do not want to change your \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pronunciation, please ignore=\r\n my writings on this subject. On the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; other hand, if you are open to c=\r\nhanging your pronunciation, please \n&gt; &gt;&gt; give a consideration to my views a=\r\nnd adopt my suggestions if you find \n&gt; &gt;&gt; them appropriate.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Take the &quot;t&quot; sound at the end of the words like &quot;prach=\r\nodayaat&quot;,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests and scholar=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pronounce this sound incorrectly. They change &quot;t&quot; to something like=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is a reason why this corruptio=\r\nn \n&gt; &gt;&gt; came into practice, but it is a corruption nevertheless.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; letter/syllable/a=\r\nkshara. If you change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by \n&gt; &gt;&gt; adding a vowel s=\r\nound at the end, it becomes two aksharas. This \n&gt; &gt;&gt; increases the number o=\r\nf aksharas, changes the chhandas and changes \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the meaning also. You ma=\r\ny still experience something when meditating \n&gt; &gt;&gt; on the mantra, but you w=\r\nill never experience the mantra to the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; fullest with that pronunciatio=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Akshara means &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the =\r\npraana (life\n&gt; &gt;&gt; force) of an akshara. If you have just a consonant withou=\r\nt a vowel \n&gt; &gt;&gt; after it, then it has no praana. It is kshara and NOT an ak=\r\nshara. It \n&gt; &gt;&gt; perishes. For example, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (without =\r\nadding any \n&gt; &gt;&gt; sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound and the listen=\r\ner cannot \n&gt; &gt;&gt; decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no life force.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one aksha=\r\nra. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Because\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;t&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply joins to=\r\n the akshara &quot;yaa&quot; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (which has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and becom=\r\nes part of that \n&gt; &gt;&gt; akshara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one letter=\r\n (one guru). \n&gt; &gt;&gt; When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is difficult for=\r\n the listener \n&gt; &gt;&gt; to know for sure whether you said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;=\r\nyaan&quot;. It is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; possible if one listens carefully, but otherwise difficu=\r\nlt. The &quot;t&quot; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; at the end is a very quick and abrupt transient sound wit=\r\nhout praana. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; So it tough to hear clearly.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; This ma=\r\nkes people add some vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in between them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\ngets a praana and becomes clearly audible. It suddenly becomes an \n&gt; &gt;&gt; aks=\r\nhara and the chhandas changes.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Probably, some big teach=\r\ner started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of =\r\nitself and becomes very clear to hear, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; so that his students would not=\r\n get confused when learning. Probably \n&gt; &gt;&gt; the students thought the mantra=\r\n was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; got used to that mis-pronunciati=\r\non. Probably, that became a standard \n&gt; &gt;&gt; practice after a couple of centu=\r\nries.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do =\r\nnot change it \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;pa=\r\nth&quot; as a consonant and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; leave it there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound=\r\n to be added at the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; end. The same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaa=\r\nt&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; What I said about words ending in c=\r\nonsonants applies to all\n&gt; &gt;&gt; consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is mo=\r\nre commonly encountered. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; There can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; et=\r\nc also. There also, \n&gt; &gt;&gt; people normally add an artificial vowel sound at =\r\nthe end and end up \n&gt; &gt;&gt; changing the chhandas and altering the flow of ene=\r\nrgy in the mantra. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; That is also wrong.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One more common mistake is the sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D\n&gt; &gt;&gt; s=\r\ntory). Most south Indians pronounce this as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D \n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nmoney). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha \n&gt; &gt;&gt; loo=\r\nks very similar and just one dot in the middle is different. It is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; po=\r\nssible that some people started mispronouncing this sound because \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of =\r\ntheir inability to see the dot and others started following. Now \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pron=\r\nouncing tha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing \n&gt; &gt;&gt; correctly wi=\r\nll be the odd person out.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Sanskrit is not English. We n=\r\never have two different symbols for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the same sound or two different so=\r\nunds for the same symbol. The \n&gt; &gt;&gt; letters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different a=\r\nnd their sounds are different \n&gt; &gt;&gt; too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D bo=\r\ndy or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a \n&gt; &gt;&gt; stress/aspiration to get &quot;th&quot; (as i=\r\nn &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; In the sankalpa before many pooj=\r\nas, people say &quot;dharmaartha \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; kaama\n&gt; &gt;&gt; moksha chaturvidha purush=\r\naartha siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for \n&gt; &gt;&gt; attaining the purusharthas (pur=\r\nposes of human existence) - dharma \n&gt; &gt;&gt; (fulfilling duties), artha (work a=\r\nnd money), kaama (fulfilling \n&gt; &gt;&gt; desires) and moksha (developing detachme=\r\nnt)&quot;. Most people end up \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;d=\r\nharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;=\r\n. Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means \n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means=\r\n &quot;half a human&quot;. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mis-pronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake =\r\nand I have seen \n&gt; &gt;&gt; it committed by many many trained priests!\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; When you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to the difference between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; differently. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay extra \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; attention to ensure that you are not confusing tha for dha.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; There are several other mistakes (in my view) commo=\r\nnly made by\n&gt; &gt;&gt; most people in the pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I wi=\r\nll be \n&gt; &gt;&gt; pointing them out slowly in the next few months, whenever the M=\r\nother \n&gt; &gt;&gt; allows me to.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Please give me your considera=\r\ntion and take my input into\n&gt; &gt;&gt; consideration in altering your pronunciati=\r\non (if you are open to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; that). If you don&#39;t find any sense in what I a=\r\nm saying or want to \n&gt; &gt;&gt; continue as taught by your gurus, I can understan=\r\nd that. I am not \n&gt; &gt;&gt; here to change everybody&#39;s pronunciation. But, becau=\r\nse She inspired \n&gt; &gt;&gt; me to share my thoughts with the world, I am guessing=\r\n that there are \n&gt; &gt;&gt; SOME who are destined to change their pronunciation b=\r\nased on my \n&gt; &gt;&gt; views.
