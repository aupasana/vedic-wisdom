These are the very professors who will get grants in =\r\nthe Western World.You will only get a grant in you potray santana dharma th=\r\nis way both in the west or in India.\n\nPeople like Prof U R rao of the Dwara=\r\nka discovery will not get money. Prof Lal of the Ayodhya exacavation discov=\r\nery will not get money....\n\nAnd then we have the pseudo secular crowd who w=\r\nill pipe in with ...what does it matter anywaz . It matters a lot if right =\r\nknowledge is to be transmitted to the next generation.\n\n\n:) Whether one bel=\r\neives it not a silent Dharma yuddha has been going on with Sanatana dharma =\r\nbeing attaked by the Marxist devils on one side and the Christian organizat=\r\nions on the other side.\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Adi=\r\nti and all the members,\n&gt; \n&gt; Vedic-Wisdom, in my opinion, silently and effe=\r\nctively doing very important work of removing a lot of mis-conceptions rega=\r\nrding Sanatan Dharma. Many members/non members who have gone through the we=\r\nalth of messages of this group would have surely benefited and found light.=\r\n their confidence would have been surely cemented in philosophies and pract=\r\nices of Hinduism/veda Dharma/Sanatan Dharma.i am sure such work is done by =\r\nmany other Groups and organisations as well.\n&gt; vomits of Kripals and Wendys=\r\n have no chance whatsoever. Only Kali knows what she will do with the autho=\r\nr of &quot;Kali&#39;s child&quot; who described Thakur as Homosexual pervert.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; i a=\r\nctually wonder as to which is a lot who can get carried away by writings su=\r\nch as &quot;Kali&#39;s child&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; What could be the effective way to counter evil =\r\ndeisgns of people like Kripals? Why and how such people get big platforms f=\r\nor their rubbish? one thing for sure is that their work must not get entry =\r\nin to University/schools. \n&gt; Aditiji - I thank you and your team of editors=\r\n and others for the effort.

Thanks for the messages of support.\n&gt; &gt; There is a lot of work to b=\r\ne done in this area. For example, Wendy Doniger,\n&gt; &gt; who is the culprit beh=\r\nind a lot of negative misportrayals of Hindus and\n&gt; &gt; Hinduism (as describe=\r\nd in the book) recently wrote a history of Hinduism\n&gt; &gt; book (though she ad=\r\nmits she is not a historian) that she is aiming to have\n&gt; &gt; be used as a st=\r\nandard textbook in Indian schools in the high school levels\n&gt; &gt; (as stated =\r\nin the introduction to the book). There have been some articles\n&gt; &gt; and oth=\r\ner reports written critiquing the book--for example, I wrote an\n&gt; &gt; article=\r\n in Outlook India refuting her claim that Rama threw out Sita because\n&gt; &gt; h=\r\ne was afraid of becoming a sex addict like his father, Dasaratha, etc.--but=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; there needs to be more of a coordinated movement not only to refute su=\r\nch\n&gt; &gt; writings but to produce scholarly and objective descriptions of Hind=\r\nuism\n&gt; &gt; that can replace the more bigoted / denigratory writings.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n I am not really into politics, but I can tell you from having been born an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; raised in America, that the school envirionment (including at the ver=\r\ny\n&gt; &gt; liberal schools I attended) is poisoned for learning about Hinduism. =\r\nThe\n&gt; &gt; most frustrating thing for me as a young girl wanting to learn abou=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt; Hinduism was the lack of resources--I would go to the Hinduism shelf =\r\nat the\n&gt; &gt; library or bookstore only to find exposes on the &quot;cult of the Ha=\r\nre Krishnas&quot;\n&gt; &gt; or trashy books on Tantric sex, or go read textbooks or ot=\r\nher scholarly\n&gt; &gt; books on Hinduism at school only to be inundated with den=\r\nouncements of caste\n&gt; &gt; and mockeries of the Hindu pantheon as, at best, am=\r\nusing mythology or, at\n&gt; &gt; worst, as a mythology that reflected certain dis=\r\nturbing pathologies of the\n&gt; &gt; Indic people.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Had I not the great f=\r\nortune of finding my guru and other true acharyas who\n&gt; &gt; were able to prov=\r\nide me a correct understanding of Hinduism, I may have\n&gt; &gt; eventually given=\r\n up my search and lost out not only on knowing my heritage\n&gt; &gt; but on findi=\r\nng the path of sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is for this reason that I think this wo=\r\nrk is so important and urgent.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; More information on these issues in=\r\n general is available at\n&gt; &gt; www.invadingthesacred.com. I also have many ex=\r\ntra copies of the book. If you\n&gt; &gt; or someone you know would be interested,=\r\n please let me know and I can\n&gt; &gt; arrange to have copies shipped. We are tr=\r\nying to provide copies to temples\n&gt; &gt; and local libraries so that it is the=\r\nre as a resource for those who are\n&gt; &gt; interested.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Warm regards,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Aditi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Mon, Oct 11, 2010 at 4:49 AM, Se Am &lt;mahalax=\r\nmyey@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  iam wondering how to give encourageme=\r\nnt to the pioneers who are doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this important scholarly rebuttal.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  ------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *From:* Narasimha PVR Rao =\r\n&lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *To:* vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *Sent:* Mon, October =\r\n11, 2010 8:37:26 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *Subject:* [vedic-wisdom] &quot;Invading the Sacred&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A member of this group =\r\ngifted me a book when he met me for a saamoohika\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Satya Narayana vrata=\r\nm we conducted at Cary, North Carolina last year. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; finally got to re=\r\nad a little from it. I am impressed with this work.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The book is=\r\n called &quot;Invading the Sacred: An Analysis of Hinduism Studies in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Amer=\r\nica&quot; (editors: Krishnan Ramaswamy, Antonio de Nicolas and Aditi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Baner=\r\njee). It has 29 scholarly articles organized in 4 sections.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Per=\r\nverted scholars with perverted anti-Hindu agendas that look down upon\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n India and Hinduism with a colonial viewpoint have conducted perverted\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; researches in the name of academic freedom at the religious studies\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n departments of western universities, published them and gained name and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; fame, trampling the sacred in the process. Crying foul or getting frust=\r\nrated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with this will not improve the situation or solve the problem. =\r\nInterested\n&gt; &gt; &gt; religious scholars have to firmly and patiently crtique th=\r\nese works in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; same academic style, in order to reclaim the rightfu=\r\nl place for Hinduism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Several papers in this book do exactly th=\r\nat. They take specific works by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; western scholars and rebut them quite=\r\n well and show how they are fallacious,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hasty, nonsensical or sometim=\r\nes downright manipulative or filled with lies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; I will just give an example of the offensive work that was rebutted in th=\r\nis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; book. [Warning: Those who are sensitive to offensive writings shou=\r\nld skip\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the next three paragraphs.]\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jeffrey Kripal from U=\r\nniv of Chicago visited Ramakrishna Mission in West\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bengal and did res=\r\nearch on Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Several people there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enthusiastical=\r\nly helped him in the researches. In the end, what he produced\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is utte=\r\nrly nonsensical and filled with lies. He published his PhD\n&gt; &gt; &gt; dissertati=\r\non without showing it to Ramakrishna Mission people to check for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fact=\r\nual or linguistic inaccuracies. Ramakrishna mission people found out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nabout what he produced only years later, after his book &quot;Kali&#39;s Child&quot; base=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the PhD dissertation won great acclaim in the West. He won an aw=\r\nard at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Americal Academy of Religion for that book, landed a job a=\r\nt Harvard and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his book was sadly mentioned in the Encyclopedia Britan=\r\nnica as the *number\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one* choice for learning about Ramakrishna.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the book, he portrayed Ramakrishna as a sexually perverted person=\r\n, a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; homosexual and a pedophile. He did not know Bengali or Hindi or S=\r\nanskrit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; well and did not take help from any Bengali people at the Mis=\r\nsion for this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; work. He used his own faulty translations, willful dist=\r\nortions and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manipulation of sources to arrive at sensational (and dam=\r\nning) conclusions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, he translated a word that means &quot;lap&quot;=\r\n as &quot;genitals&quot;, in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; context of Swami Brahmananda (spiritual son of=\r\n Ramakrishna and a young boy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then) sitting in Ramakrishna&#39;s lap. He t=\r\nranslated a word that means\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;touching softly&quot; as &quot;uncontrollably rubb=\r\ning sandalpaste on the penises of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; boys&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Even in places w=\r\nhere there was no material to mis-translate, he simply\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speculated! Fo=\r\nr example, he speculated on the meeting of Totapuri and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna, =\r\nin which the naaga sadhu (naked ascetic) Totapuri taught\n&gt; &gt; &gt; advaita veda=\r\nnta to Ramakrishna and made him go beyond Mother Kali and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience =\r\nnirvikalpa samadhi: &quot;What it must have been like for Ramakrishna,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a h=\r\nomosexually oriented man, to be shut away for days in a small hut with\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; another, stark-naked man. Vedanta instruction or not, it was this man&#39;s\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; nudity, and more especially, his penis, that normally caught Ramakrish=\r\nna&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attention. How could it not?&quot; Please note that he is not referri=\r\nng to any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; source and mis-translating it, but simply speculating based=\r\n on his perverted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; agenda!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you see th=\r\ne book, you will see many examples of such pseudo-scholarship\n&gt; &gt; &gt; driven =\r\nby heinous agendas. It is a fact that many perverted people under\n&gt; &gt; &gt; asu=\r\nric influences make their livelihood, money and fame lying and spreading\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; falsehoods about Hinduism, Hindu deities and Hindu saints.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThose who are not inclined to fight a dharma yuddha against this may ignore=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this and go on doing their sadhana. After all, if enough people do s=\r\nadhana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to strengthen sanatana dharma, this kind of things will automa=\r\ntically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; weaken. However, some scholars engaging these pseudo-scholars=\r\n academically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is really required on the ground. We need to give our e=\r\nncouragement to the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pioneers who are doing this important scholarly r=\r\nebuttal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free =\r\nJyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; rit=\r\nual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a differen=\r\nce: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
