But the roles are not static. They ar=\r\ne dynamic and may undergo fine-tuning or modification or evolution from tim=\r\ne to time (and life to life) based on how we play our allotted roles. \n\nThe=\r\n role you are given is your destiny and how you play it is your free will. =\r\nHow you play your role now (free will) influences what role you are given i=\r\nn future (destiny).\n\nIf the role given to you (e.g. Arjuna) is to kill your=\r\n guru (Drona) and relatives, you cannot escape it. But you can either do it=\r\n with a hateful mind or a guilty mind or you can do it with a calm mind. If=\r\n the role given to you (e.g. Janaka) is to rule a big kingdom, you cannot e=\r\nscape and do penances in a forest. But you can either rule the kingdom with=\r\n a proud and attached mind or with a calm mind. If the role given to you (e=\r\n.g. Swami Samarth Ramadas) is to guide a mighty king (Shivaji) in resisting=\r\n the invading muslim kings, you cannot escape it. But you can either do it =\r\nwith an attached and agitated mind or a calm mind.\n\nPeople in the examples =\r\nI mentioned above engaged in what may seem like material actions, but they =\r\ndid them after overcoming attachments and with an equanimous mind.\n\nAs I ke=\r\nep saying, what you do is a secondary factor and how you do it is primary. =\r\nEven as we engage in actions that we believe to be our dharma, we should wo=\r\nrk on our attitude and increase surrender. When one has surrendered to god =\r\nand is able to look at pleasure and pain, praise and censure in the same wa=\r\ny, then one&#39;s dharma will be far clearer to one. One whose mind is densely =\r\nconditioned by duality and desires will see one&#39;s dharma through the colori=\r\nng of that conditioning and may misjudge. On the other hand, one with a cle=\r\nar mind with very little conditioning will see one&#39;s dharma clearer.\n\nIn si=\r\nmpler words, one who heavily identifies with the body and wants comforts an=\r\nd pleasures of the body will see one&#39;s dharma from that motivation. One may=\r\n identify with body, with a group of people, with a deity etc. As is the id=\r\nentification, so is the conditioning and so is one&#39;s vision of one&#39;s dharma=\r\n.\n\nThough everyone is playing their allotted role, some have densely condit=\r\nioned minds and unable to see their dharma clearly and pursuing adharma. As=\r\n a result, they may continue to be allotted roles where densely conditioned=\r\n minds restrict their actions, in future.\n\nSome have very clear minds and a=\r\nble to see their dharma clearly and pursuing higher dharma. As a result, th=\r\ney may continue to allotted roles where lighter and lighter mental conditio=\r\nning restricts them and eventually they become free.\n\nOne can try to use fr=\r\nee will to move from the former case to the latter case.\n\nBest regards,\nNar=\r\nasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do I=\r\nt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0=\r\n =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0Films that make a difference: http://Saraswa=\r\ntiFilms.org\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/J=\r\nyotishWritings\n------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\n\n---- Raj Nambisan &lt;rajnambisan@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; namaste,\n&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0 \n&gt; i have a question: if everyone is playing the allotted role, as the =\r\npeerless maharshi alludes to, then what&#39;s the point in our debating these t=\r\nhings? \n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; wouldn&#39;t the thesis apply to osama, nehru, gandhiji equa=\r\nlly -- that is, each one is/was playing the exact role he is/was supposed t=\r\no, right or wrong?\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; which begs the question, when does free will =\r\nbegin and fate end?\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; enlightenment, please..\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; regards,\n=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; raj\n\n---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear=\r\n KK,\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; Great question!\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; Also, I personally do not agree =\r\nthat a saint cannot interfere in the political situation of a country.
