After all, many rishis had wives!\n \nIf latent desires are there in the mind, remaining unmarried may not solve the problem but only postpone it. The goal of sadhana is not to &quot;pretend&quot; to be a liberated person or &quot;behave&quot; like a liberated person, but to &quot;become&quot; liberated.\n \nKarmas and rinas are like a rope that ties a goat to a tree. The goat can move around in a limited space, depending on the size of the rope, but cannot go beyond. Similarly, one has some free will but its scope depends on how serious (short) the karmas and rinas (rope) are. What your rinas are, what scope your free will has and what is the best course of action for you, is to be determined by you. But, if that is not clear at this time, do not think or analyze much now and go on with life. Try to do your sadhana and surrender. Guidance regarding the direction to take in this matter (as well as others) will come in time. When the logical mind and intuitive mind do not have enough information to decide a matter wisely, it is better to wait (unless one is forced to decide it now).\n \n*        *\n \nNamaste Aditi,\n \nVery good points. Forcible repression can boomerang as you said. Nor is free indulgence a feasible strategy, for there is no end to it. You put it very well: &quot;channeling healthily, controlling, and then overcoming the desire&quot;.\n \nYour point regading unilateral decision by a man or a woman is also good. However, this is a matter of tradeoff. When one has two options before one, one weighs them and chooses the better option. One may commit a bad karma in order to facilitate another good karma that is deemed bigger or more important. It is a matter of a tradeoff and personal choice.\n \nSwami Shivananda, whom Swami Vivekananda used to call &quot;Mahapurush&quot; (great soul), did not touch his wife after marriage and she died a broken person. Swami Yogananda was tricked into marriage by his eager parents and he too uniliterally took up brahmacharya. He did not even go into the room for his first night. Such Swamis may have succeeded in offseting the bad karma with some other good karma they did to the affected souls or they may be paying back in the next lives. Both are possible.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- sayantan bose &lt;sayantan.bose@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Pranam Guruji,\n&gt; to all my seniors,\n&gt; and fellow mates,\n&gt; \n&gt; i have a simple quarry regarding this matter. since i am quite young and unmarried and i still have the opportunity to avoid marriage ..\n&gt; \n&gt; Q) so is it possible to avoid marriage by will or am i bound to marry in case i have some karmic debts or rna bandhanas? \n&gt; \n&gt; since i believe prevention is better than cure.. i am thinking in this way .. yes i have been maintaining celibacy for quite a long time .. and i do understand that even a thought is karma.. now is there in anyways to avoid it in anyways by people like us who still have a chance.. or are we bound by our karmas and rnas?\n&gt; \n&gt; i beg of mercy if i have said something wrong .. please do correct me for any mistakes\n&gt; \n&gt; yours sincerely Sayantan,\n&gt; \n&gt; JAI MAA!\n \n---- Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; I notice this discussion has been mostly among men, many of whom appear to\n&gt; be married. I would like to point out that brahmacharya should not be taken\n&gt; as a unilateral decision and that the wife&#39;s sexual needs also be honored\n&gt; and respected (whether verbally articulated or not). Even Ramakrishna\n&gt; offered Sarada that he would give up his sexual abstinence in order to\n&gt; fulfill his husbandly dharma towards her. Grhastha dharma in many of our\n&gt; scriptures enjoins certain restrictions upon sexual behavior (e.g., not\n&gt; during Ekadasi or other certain days, or so many days after a woman&#39;s menses\n&gt; has ended, etc.), which are short of extended periods of sexual celibacy but\n&gt; nevertheless accomplish the same ends (gradually, over time) of channeling\n&gt; healthily, controlling, and then overcoming the desire for sex. Also,\n&gt; forcible repression can have the opposite effet--flaring up of strong sexual\n&gt; urges that can be more problematic later on if healthy release is not\n&gt; allowed. A lot of problems in the Catholic church, ISKCON and now BAPS are\n&gt; attributable to this.\n\n\n"}}
