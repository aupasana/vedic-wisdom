It\n&gt; all boils down to\n&gt;&gt;           the amount of fire that is present in the homa kunda. If\n&gt; there is good\n&gt;&gt;           amount of fire, even if you do not offer ghee, offering\n&gt; marmara , havan\n&gt;&gt;           samagri etc will be easily consumed. But if the fire is\n&gt; small, then you\n&gt;&gt;           do need to offer ghee drops to keep the fire alive.\n&gt;&gt;           There were days when I used about 8-10 coconut halves for\n&gt; 1\n&gt;&gt;           chandi homam, ie started with 2 pieces of 1 coconut half,\n&gt; adding half\n&gt;&gt;           piece of coconut half for each chapter and finally a\n&gt; piece for\n&gt;&gt;           purnahuti. Now, I am able to manage 1 chandi homa with\n&gt; about 2-3 coconut\n&gt;&gt;           halves. Others out there might be able to do with much\n&gt; less. It also\n&gt;&gt;           depends on the coconut pieces itself, some pieces burn\n&gt; slow and some\n&gt;&gt;           fast, so the quantity you may need may vary.\n&gt;&gt;           Most importantly I suggest you follow an important advice\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt;           Narasimhaji. Pouring ghee drops around the corners of the\n&gt; coconut piece,\n&gt;&gt;           making sure the piece catches fire from all the corners.\n&gt; Doing this way,\n&gt;&gt;           at the end of the homa, all the coconut pieces are\n&gt; completely burnt,\n&gt;&gt;           almost like powder.\n&gt;&gt;           So, my suggestion to you is to have plenty of offerings\n&gt; at your\n&gt;&gt;           disposal, try to keep the fire going ( big or small does\n&gt; not matter).\n&gt;&gt;           Make sure the offerings that you put with each swaha\n&gt; (sloka) catch fire.\n&gt;&gt;           Hold your offerings ie havan samagri, marmara, poha etc\n&gt; joining your\n&gt;&gt;           ring finger, middle finger and thumb. This way, you will\n&gt; be offering\n&gt;&gt;           decent amount with each swaha.\n&gt;&gt;           Like Narasimhaji, I prepare a mixture of havan samagri,\n&gt; black and\n&gt;&gt;           white sesame seeds, marmara,poha etc in a container and\n&gt; used the\n&gt;&gt;           combination as offering.\n&gt;&gt;           I am sure within first few days of your homa, you will\n&gt; have very\n&gt;&gt;           good idea of how much ghee and other offerings you need\n&gt; to make.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           All the Best.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           Ravi\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;           --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot;\n&gt;&gt;           &lt;khosladheeraj@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;           &gt;\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot;\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; khosladheeraj@ wrote:\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; Namaskar Narsimhaji and others,\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; I want to do homam for chandi devi.I\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; had arranged a copper tray in square shape.Almost 1\n&gt; feet by 1\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; feet.\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; So is it good measurement or not ?

I have arranged 2 kg of havan samagri, 1\n&gt; kg dry\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; coconuts\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; etc..So how to divide this in ratio as per single day\n&gt; process.How\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; much ghee in grams per havana.ALthough i am reading\n&gt; your pdf notes\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; on homam again and again but doing practical things r\n&gt; difficult\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; and\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; need much more focus and methodology.\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; Although by God grace and your encouragement to\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; people for doing homams, even i myself get\n&gt; transformed towards\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; homam ,so thanks for that. But i need your step by\n&gt; step guidance\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; as\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; everything is not included in your notes( although\n&gt; its best notes\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; on homam). Its my weakness actually.\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; In normal homams by priests in India ,they do swaha\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; with ghee in fire aswell in water.So tell me, I mean\n&gt; after they\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; pour\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; ghee through spoon in agni ,they immediately pour one\n&gt; drop of ghee\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; in water too. So is it correct way or not ?\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; If single person is doing a homam then how to\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; manage\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; ahutis of ghee and samagri both and of course mantra\n&gt; mala or notes\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; u\n&gt;&gt;           &gt; &gt; provided ?
