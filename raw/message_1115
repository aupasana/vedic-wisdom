I to=\r\nld \n&gt; myself that it is surely due to the amount of stress, his body must \n=\r\n&gt; have gone thro&#39; because of tremendous Sadhanaas he has performed in \n&gt; re=\r\ncent years.\n&gt; \n&gt; like you all noticed, i was also pleasently surprised to s=\r\nee \n&gt; the &#39;Glowing Face&#39; of his in the video when i saw it for the first \n&gt;=\r\n time day before yesterday. actually i was very happy to see his \n&gt; shining=\r\n face in that video.\n&gt; BUT it hardly matters to me if his face is shining o=\r\nr lusterless. \nTo \n&gt; be honest, Even his knowledge has not impressed me tha=\r\nt much \nbecause \n&gt; You&#39;ll find great many &#39;Orators&#39; and philosophical lactu=\r\nrers. even \ni \n&gt; can give a good philosophical lacture. it may not be a big=\r\n deal now \n&gt; a days. What has really impressed me is his attitude of engagi=\r\nng \n&gt; into practical Sadhanaas. He has inspired me with his demonstration \n=\r\n&gt; of doing Sadhanaas. His steadfastness in putting long hours for \nGod. \n&gt; =\r\n32 chandi Homas in 3 days is not a joke. He is very very serious in \n&gt; his =\r\nquest for Realisation and THAT is the thing which inspires me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Padmaja Sunc=\r\nhu \n&gt; &lt;padmaja.sunchu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Om Vishnave Namah\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namasthe =\r\nMitesh\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Its a coincidence that I too was thinking of the same, when=\r\n I \n&gt; first saw the\n&gt; &gt; video.\n&gt; &gt; I had met Sri Narasimha garu in August 2=\r\n006 at the SJC West Coast\n&gt; &gt; Conference,\n&gt; &gt; and I see a lustre in his fac=\r\ne now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Srinivasa\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 6, 2009 at 7:21 AM, m540i98 =\r\n&lt;m540i98@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Namaste\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The video is very good, =\r\nGood work by the video grapher and \n&gt; Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It was a pleasure wa=\r\ntching it and I feel that I will watch it a \n&gt; few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; more times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most importantly I want to bring out the fact that when one \ndoes \n&gt; =\r\na lot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; japams and homams, the good work is reflected in the persons \n&gt;=\r\n face,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the lustre etc. Although I have not met Narasimha ever, I have=\r\n \n&gt; seen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one picture of him may be from many years ago and now the vi=\r\ndeo.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a striking difference between the two.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\ntransformation internally may be more intense and \nfantanstic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nOn a different note, I have heard from a very realized soul that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nSaffron color or the Garoua color one donned by monks is \n&gt; reserved\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nfor them, it is not advisible for people like us married or \n&gt; single to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; put it on.
