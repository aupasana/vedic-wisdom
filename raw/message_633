Even great jnaanis are \noccasionally deluded by Her power. One can understand unmanifested non-dual \nBrahman, but one cannot hope to understand the dual world fully ever. She is \ncapable of deluding even the greatest sadhaka with a wrong idea as soon as \none ventures into duality. She can mislead *anyone* on *anything*. What She \ndoes and why She does that is so difficult to fathom. The only way to deal \nwith Her is to surrender to Her power *fully*.\n\n&gt; on the other hand we are all a part of Divinity\n\nBTW, though we are all part of the same Divinity, we are all not the same. \nIn the non-dual field, we are all the same. But, in the field of duality, we \nhave differences due to previous vasanas (conditioning), which decide what \nand how much we can do within the dual world. When a being like Krishna is \nborn with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of the dual world. \nWhen a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of \nthings in the dual world that are impossible for others.\n\nRealizing the non-dual Self is something that is possible for anyone, but \nthere are limits imposed on what things one can do in the dual world, based \non the force of previous conditioning. Thus, all are the same at one \n(non-dual) level and all are different at another (dual) level.\n\nBut it is tough to know for sure what one&#39;s caliber is. Thus, your basic \npoint holds. But I just wanted to point that all are not indeed the same. We \nshould be disinterested in knowing who is what, not because all are the \nsame, but because we have no surefire way to know who is what.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, November 10, 2008 7:54 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today\n\n\n|| Om Lokaah Samastaah Sukhino Bhavantuh ||\n\nDoes it matter at all who is whose reincarnation?

Sri Yogeshwar was a very highly\n&gt; realized saint. His book is very good. He does mention about his\n&gt; prevoius birth and also mentions that Saccha Baba had also confirmed\n&gt; the same thing. Saccha Baba was another very highly realized saint too.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Yogeshwar had many times visions of Sai Baba of shirdi and Naamdev\n&gt; and also many other saints too. The initiation he got on the bank of\n&gt; river Narmada awakened his kundalini and he has described very\n&gt; accurately the state and symptoms after awekaning of kunalini. He had\n&gt; very good command on all aspects of sprituality and was a fantastic\n&gt; orator. His followers have done a very good job of putting up the web\n&gt; site and sharing the information for free both audio and books.\n&gt;\n&gt; Chiti Leela or the play of Shakti or God is very complex, Ramakrishna\n&gt; may have taken birth as more than one person and in future may take\n&gt; more births.\n&gt;\n&gt; His comsic body (karan sharir) or whatever name others use pardon my\n&gt; lack of appropriate word, is also alive and manifest from time to time\n&gt; After reading this and other books, I feel that each one of us has a\n&gt; inner guru along with our atma and this inner guru in conjunction with\n&gt; our accumulated or sanchit sankaras give us visions of these mahatmas\n&gt; or help us attach or attract to a Saint or some aspects of the saint\n&gt; more than others. This inner guru is the same in all humam beings but\n&gt; manifests uniquely based on each person.\n&gt;\n&gt; I also believe that one needs to get initiated by a Guru who is\n&gt; present in physical form and seek guidance from him time to time.\n&gt; There are many instances of other forms of inititations like\n&gt; initiation in dream or inititation by cosmic forms, these forms of\n&gt; initiations though very important are very rare or uncommon.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; After reading Sri Yogeshwar&#39;s book I had some questions pop up in my\n&gt; mind about him.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) What was the purpose of his birth? Yes he may have guided many\n&gt; spiritual aspirants, but there has to be something more unique.\n&gt; 2) Did he realize the ultimate? i.e. he keeps mentioning in the book\n&gt; about it in many places? Was he satisfied? How did he feel after that?\n&gt; 3) He did pass away abruptly in bombay while in the middle of giving\n&gt; spirtual talks? It seems unusual.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have also read somewhere that once a person reaches a spiritual\n&gt; state, he cannot remain in human body for more than few days, was this\n&gt; the case?\n&gt;\n&gt; May be others who have read this book can share more light.\n&gt; I do recommend to seekers of spirutuality to read this book if one has\n&gt; time, it is available for free to download as a pdf book on his web\nsite.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Ram Sharma also has done a lot of work for the betterment and\n&gt; upliftment, a lot of his information is wellknown.

His Guru then made him realise his past lives\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gave him the work for this life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He took him back as in a flash to the past.

This is an unbelievable experience that I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing\n&gt; &gt; exactly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as was happened in my life. I am going back to the period of\n&gt; &gt; 1973/74.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly read this only when you are in religious mood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near\n&gt; &gt; Dwarka.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post\n&gt; &gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep�?Tt; I had friendship with some\n&gt; &gt; Telephone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of� � � shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekly\n&gt; &gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created\n&gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly\n&gt; &gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--\n&gt; &gt; �?oRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My\n&gt; &gt; son\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now�?�. -\n&gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be a plane\n&gt; &gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about\n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus,\n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was\n&gt; &gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super\n&gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered\n&gt; &gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel�?Ts house before Thakur picture. I prayed\n&gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his\n&gt; &gt; grace.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was\n&gt; &gt; waking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and\n&gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. �?&quot;�?oWhy should you take such a hasty\n&gt; &gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He\n&gt; &gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru should be living one, who can guide us,\n&gt; &gt; give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma\n&gt; &gt; Acharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra�?�--.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were right at her place as people in general not\n&gt; &gt; know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before accepting him. I also decided to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that �?&quot;�?oSee, Mr. Patel\n&gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen him. He has never\n&gt; &gt; asked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house\n&gt; &gt; within\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection for Thakur is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; perfect?�?�--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me�?&quot;�?oHow it is possible? I don�?Tt believe.�?�-\n&gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; decision and convince my wife. �?~I want to test your existence\n&gt; &gt; even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; today.�?T\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; morning with angry mood. What he told?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; �?~ How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happened?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pulled my blanket and told me that-�?o Go to your friend�?Ts\n&gt; &gt; house. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his\n&gt; &gt; house�?�\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the way\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are\n&gt; &gt; disturbing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him in such an early morning for such a silly things?�?T\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We both were so excited and surprised that we had no words that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Morning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life.\n&gt; &gt; There\n&gt; &gt; &gt; were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will\n&gt; &gt; write\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it sometime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; earth. This is a fact I have written and no word is added to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exaggerate.� May Shri Thakur bless all of us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad\n\n\n"}}
