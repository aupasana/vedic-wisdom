I have a large one purchased from India. T=\r\nhe lamp can burn on 24X7 basis, with its oil capacity. \n&gt; \n&gt; I use Seasome =\r\noil and it does not give smell. My wick comes as a roll and has been purcha=\r\nsed from Khadhi Bandar from Chennai. I cut a long length (say about 10&quot;size=\r\n) cotton thread from the wick roll and fold it, so that the thread has beco=\r\nme thicker and has two heads in once place for brighter and better lamp bur=\r\nning. \n&gt; \n&gt; For maintaining akhand jyoti, I have been increasing the wick l=\r\nength once in 8 hours, after removing the burnt ball from wick, which is fa=\r\nlling with in the lamp. This is the only practical way I have experienced s=\r\no far. \n&gt; \n&gt; I allow the lamp to be completely over once in a week. I clean=\r\n the lamp thoroughly for removing the burnt black balls that fell in oil/ l=\r\namp. \n&gt; \n&gt; Previously I used to burn flat lamp, where again the wick has to=\r\n be protruded to increase the length. \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;priyank_priyank&quot; &lt;aks_day@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namas=\r\nte all, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3 days back i started keeping Akhand deep, (copper deep w=\r\nith central wick hole, Mustard oil). After 2-3 hrs of burning the tip of th=\r\ne burning wick gets burned and forms small charcoal ball and the flame beco=\r\nmes small. In night it got extinguished coz of same issue. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; for ma=\r\nintaining akhand jyot it seems one has to increase the wick length for burn=\r\ning and remove burnt ball on top of wick every 5-6 hrs. this doesnt seem pr=\r\nactical. i think i might be doing something wrong.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please guide. \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; priyank\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
