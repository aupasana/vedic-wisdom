Two fundamental points:\n \n(1) Truth is too complicated and throwing light on all aspects of Truth simultaneously requires volumes to be written or spoken. To simplify things, a great yogi may emphasize one aspect and downplay others. If a yogi&#39;s job is to make someone climb a mountain using one path, does he need to survey all the sides of the entire mountain and make factual statements on every nook and corner? Even if he makes misleading statements about paths on the other side of the mountain, it does not matter as long he he succeeded in motivating several people to climb the mountain in one path and several of them reached the pinnacle.\n \n(2) Even a great yogi who masters the knowledge of non-dual Self, may be deluded with respect to the knowledge of dual Self, i.e. the vast field of duality (which springs from Self). The Divine Mother gives whatever knowledge is needed for one to fulfil one&#39;s job and can keep one in some level of misunderstanding about some aspects of the field of duality.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSwami Vivekananda came at a time of superstition and ritualism by the mainstream, when young and intelligent men were being influenced by modern atheistic and monotheistic philosophies. It was a time when astrology was corrupted badly and did not stand a chance of revival. It was a time when people superstitiously believed in fate, astrology, muhurtas etc.\n \nHis agenda was to put brakes on superstition and ritualism, promote a deeper understanding of the knowledge of rishis, attract intelligent young men towards the adwaitic teachings of rishis, create belief that one is a master of one&#39;s destiny, exhort a dormant giant to arise and awake and tell the world about that dormant giant. Some of his specific messages may be tuned for his desa-kaala-paatra.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; When assumes the role of scholar/guru he is under compulsion\n&gt; to pass judgement over every issue and answer every question\n&gt; asked, irresepective of whether he knows about them or not.\n \nFirst of all, neither I nor Rajarshi (nor even Manish) are assuming the role of a &quot;guru&quot;. Some people who appreciate our views on various issues may end up looking at us as gurus, but we ourselves do not call ourselves gurus. I, for one, look at myself as a traffic sign board that shows directions to Delhi. I may or may not know much about Delhi, but I have been installed by my guru and the Mother to show the direction to Delhi to people interested in travelling to Delhi. It is good if some people actually reach Delhi using this sign board, but it does not really matter to me.\n \nSecondly, the compulsion you mention is unwise. Why pass judgment over something one does not know?\n \nA good guru is not one who has a strong opinion on everything, or who knows everything, or who answers all questions. A good guru is one who somehow or the other ensures that the disciple gets the correct understanding - not just an intellectual understanding but an understanding that is ingrained in one&#39;s consciousness and affects one&#39;s attitude, thoughts and actions deeply.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhat is your motivation in asking for an opinion on Vivekananda&#39;s quote on astrology? Are you trying to cast aspersions and dismiss Vivekananda&#39;s critique on ritualistic interpretations of Veda, that was mentioned by Rajarshi?\n \nVivekananda was an active teacher. He may have made many statements when he was at different levels of realization. But his comment on Veda and a need for interpreting Veda correctly came on the last day of his life too. He forced his students to get a commentary, read one verse, and gave his independent interpretation tying it to some yogic/tantric concepts. He remarked that Veda needed to be interpreted correctly. By that time, he had the fullest realization of his true nature and also knew that he was about to give that body up. His statement on Veda on the last day of his life was almost like an acknowledgement of a task that could not be finished in that life and was left for others.\n \nInterestingly, work of Aurobindo Ghose&#39;s life was like a fulfilment of that wish of Vivekananda. It is interesting that Aurobindo claimed to have been visited by Vivekananda (who left body several years earlier) and taught some philosophy while he was in prison.\n \nIn any case, those who think that Veda teaches explicit details about external rituals need to think whether knowledge of external actions in the material world can ever be &quot;absolute&quot; and untouched by desa-kaala-paatra. Veda is *absolute* knowledge that has nothing *relative* (i.e. based on desa-kaala-paatra).\n \nAurobindo&#39;s &quot;Secret of the Veda&quot; is the most definitive work of the last few millennia on Veda.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Sindhu Saraswathi &lt;moulamagamagguru@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Shri.Rajarshi,\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1.&quot;Pardon me for being rude, but Frits Staals .......... &quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; I was not referring to the article of Frits Staal, but the book written by him called &quot;Agni&quot;,Please go through it if you get a chance.

They made it a rule to take the horoscope of all the prominent men living from time to time, calculated from the time of their birth. In this way they got a record of leading facts predicted, and compared them afterwards with events as they happened. This was done for a thousand years, until they found certain agreements; these were generalized, recorded, and made into a huge book. The dynasty died out, but the family of astrologers lived and had this book in their possession. It seems possible that this is how astrology came into existence. Excessive attention to the minutiae of astrology is one of the superstitious which has hurt the HINDUS very much. \n&gt;  \n&gt; I think the Greeks first took astrology to India and took from the Hindus the science of astronomy and carried it back with them to Europe. Because in India you will find old altars, made according to a certain geometrical plan, and certain things had to be done when the stars were in when certain positions, therefore I think the Greeks gave the Hindus astrology, and the Hindus gave them astronomy. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Do you also agree to this ?\n&gt;  \n&gt; When assumes the role of scholar/guru he is under compulsion to pass judgement over every issue and answer every question asked, irresepective of whether he knows about them or not.\n&gt;  \n&gt; God bless you.\n&gt;  \n&gt; --- On Sun, 20/6/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Homa procedure\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, 20 June, 2010, 10:00 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Welcome to this forum. I would like to make a few brief points regarding some of your ideas as mentioned below.\n&gt;  \n&gt;  I suggest reading of the volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get a insight into the importance of these steps.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Pardon me for being rude, but Frits Staals understanding of the vedic ritual is naive at best and criminally incorrect at worst. He had written a huge, lengthy article on why and how mantras are nothing but sounds of birds and bees which were aped by ancient people, and they are supposed to have neither meaning nor sense! A person with such a shallow understanding of the spiritual essence of Sanatana Dharma, cannot be expected to recognize the spiritual essence and depth of &quot;Agni&quot;. Vedas, specially the Rig Veda, is not a book of rituals/history/ or even dharma, but probably a testimony of the various spiritual realities on the path to self-realization, mentioned in coded/allegorical verses. A\n&gt;  \n&gt; Swami Vivekananda was self-realized saint. During his last days, he once called one of his disciples and mentioned that the interpretation of Vedas done by Sayanacharya as well as others were, in his opinion, not upto the mark. It missed out on the essence of what the Vedas really are. Therefore, he urged his disciples to meditate on the verses and in future, and that someone has to come up with a more holistic and deeper interpretation of the Vedic riks. It is an interesting coincidence that Sri Aurobindo had a vision of Vivekanada in which Vivekanada instructed him on certain things of the higher plane, and later Sri Aurobindo came up with a new perspective on the Vedas and specially the hymns of Agni.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There are different homam proceudures followed by different paramparas in different parts of India. I am sure none of them is incorrect. The final judge of the success of any sustained sadhana like a homa is nothing other than the sadhaka/experiencer himself. If the sadhana is making the sadhaka more detached, etc etc,the sadhana is working. If not, more hard work is needed. It is not the number of rules that you add or substract, but it is finally the internal transformations that you experience which are crucial. There are people who follow a million rules of procedure for performing various rituals and yet never experienced even a drop of divine essence, experience no transformations. What use is such rituals for a sadhaka? Religion is a practical science. Whatever helps a sadhaka to reach God is good, whatever does not is bad. In this light, the homa procedures given by Narasimha are practical, doable sadhanas, which when done regularly helps to\n&gt;  transform an individual. Many have experienced the same, many more will in the future. And all this has been possible only because the Divine Mother wants it so. \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 19/6/10, moulamagamagguru &lt;moulamagamagguru@ yahoo.in&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: moulamagamagguru &lt;moulamagamagguru@ yahoo.in&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Homa procedure\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, 19 June, 2010, 12:32 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Members,\n&gt; \n&gt; At the outset, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for guiding me into this forum. I had posted a message in jHora in response to a forward from Jyotishwritings on &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree that jHora is not the right forum for discussing these topics.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have gone through the homam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam being performed and have the following observations to make.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. As per rules laid out by srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for various rituals, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which is the prakruti of all yajnas).\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. All steps in darsapoornamasa should be there in the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has to be there). We are nobody to judge which are essential and which are not essential. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. There are variations in procedures in the different sutras such as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. become worthy of divine usage only when they are divinised using the right procedure. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as named. I suggest reading of the volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get a insight into the importance of these steps.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. The procedure in the manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are large deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik procedures. \n&gt; \n&gt; 6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is a particular manner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucked under the bottom of the prceeding ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7. The direction for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. This can not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starting from NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).\n&gt; \n&gt; 8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in the vessel above darbha is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purification of the utensils is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 10. Patra samskaram or purifying the utensils is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 13. Ajya samskaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the homa dravya used for havan is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 14. Darvee samskaram or purification of ladles used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be used (sruksruvou) .\n&gt; \n&gt; 15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 16. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni iis missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the ladle in the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.\n&gt; \n&gt; and many more ............\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure the deity is not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of deity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the particular deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary)\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni acts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is converted into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya ahutis.\n&gt; \n&gt; 19. Very good alternate homa procedures are available in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They don&#39;t involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t have to struggle to get the right pronunciation and svaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sadhakas who perform homam on their own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom homam for any devata.\n&gt; \n&gt; 20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can be learned from a video. It involves learning from an able guru and practice with devotion, precision and perfection.\n&gt; \n&gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.\n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
