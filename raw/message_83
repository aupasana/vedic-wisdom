As always, please ignore this fool \nif something sounds silly.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIf you are interested in Advaitism (non-duality), I recommend reading the \nworks of Adi Shankara. He is considered a great teacher of Advaitism and an \nincarnation of Lord Shiva Himself. In fact, a scripture mentions Shiva \ntelling Parvati that he will be born in Kali Yuga as Adi Shankara to revive \nAdvaitism and to refine the teachings of Buddha.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI personally consider &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; to be the highest treatise on \nAdvaitism. I have read many authors, but none matches the brilliance of \nVasishtha. After all, he is a maharshi and one of the saptarshis and it does \nshow.\n\nMaharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Rama (an incarnation of Lord Vishnu) about \nself-knowledge in great detail, in the presence of many gods and rishis \nincluding Maharshi Vishwamitra. These teachings were later taught by \nMaharshi Vaalmiki (author of Ramayana) to Maharshi Bharadwaja. Yoga \nVaasishtham is thus a detailed account of Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s teachings \ncaptured by Maharshi Vaalmiki.\n\nThe commentary by Swami Venkatesananda is quite an inspired one and I very \nvery strongly recommend it to everyone deeply interested in the highest \nHindu Advaitic philosophy. You can find it on amazon.com.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIn &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; mentioned above, there is a beautiful narrative where \nMaharshi Vasishtha describes to Lord Rama his meeting with Lord Shiva. Lord \nShiva teaches Vasishtha how to worship Him. He says, &quot;there are many ways to \nworship me that are used by many foolish people who desire various things. \nThey may even get various things worshipping me in those ways prescribed in \nsome scriptures. But those are inferior methods of worship. Let me tell you \nthe highest worship that is most dear to me. It is how a self-realized \nperson worships me.&quot; He then describes the method so beautifully.\n\nIt is an absolutely beautiful account. I can say that Shiva&#39;s teachings to \nVasishtha on the best way to worship Him are the essence of Vedas, the \nessence of BhagavadGeetha and the essence of the highest Hindu philosophy. \nOne interested in self-realization and moksha must read Shiva&#39;s teachings \nand keep them at the back of their mind always.\n\nI don&#39;t mean to be disrespectful to various aagamas and rituals prescribed \nin various scriptures. They all serve a purpose. But, if one views moksha \n(complete self-realization and the liberation that comes with it) as the \nhighest goal, one cannot ignore the worship recommended by Shiva Himself to \nVasishtha.\n\n*        *        *\n\nHinduism is indeed a &quot;collection of philosophies&quot;. However, that may be a \nmisleading statement. It may suggest some inherent self-contradiction. That \nwould be unfair.\n\nThough different ripples of an ocean look different, the underlying ocean is \nthe same. Similarly, the teachings of rishis form a single coherent \nphilosophy (ocean) that appears as many philosophies (ripples) on the \nsurface.\n\nAfter all, Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti&quot;, which means \n&quot;Truth is One, but the learned call differently&quot;. Though Hinduism had no &quot;no \nsingle founder&quot; or ANY founder for that matter, all rishis tapped the same \n&quot;Single Source of Knowledge&quot; (the Self, known variously as Brahman, Shiva, \nNarayana, Krishna, Allah, Buddha etc) and hence there is a consistency in \ntheir understanding.\n\nUnfortunately, not everyone can dive deep into the ocean of self-knowledge. \nSome are more comfortable floating on the surface (which is fun too). The \nteachings of rishis have something for everyone. This gives the appearance \nthat rishis taught different contradicting philosophies. In fact, they \ndidn&#39;t.\n\n*        *        *\n\nLike the gentleman below mentioned, there are three main views regarding the \nrelationship between individual soul and the supreme soul. However, instead \nof viewing them as competing theories, one can also view them as steps in \nthe same path. I want to share with all an *analogy* given by my spiritual \nmaster Dr Manish Pandit:\n\nImagine God to be a bright star in the sky. When you see from a distance, \nstar seems tiny and you conclude that there is only one God. If you start \nmoving towards God, you realize as you get closer that the star is in \nreality a huge diamond with 330 million faces. Each face is several miles \nlong and wide and has various attributes (gunas). One face may be red and \nhot and another may be blue and cold etc. So, as you get closer to the \ndiamond, you have to pick one face to get close to.\n\nNow, when you get too close to a face, the whole world will seem to have the \nattributes of that face. For example, if you get too close to a face that is \ncold and blue, then the whole world will feel cold and blue to you. In other \nwords, the God you are getting close to is the Supreme god of the world and \nfills the entire world as you experience it. You think that the whole world \nis filled with his energy. One who gets close to a blue face sees the whole \nworld as blue. One who gets close to a yellow face sees the whole world as \nyellow. Similarly, a worshipper of Shiva may get close to Him and see Shiva \nin all deities and all beings. A worshipper of Narayana may get close to Him \nand see Narayana in all beings.\n\nNo wonder one scripture says that Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva etc all gods came \nfrom Narayana, while another scripture says the same about Mahaganapathi, \nwhile another scripture says the same thing about Shiva; and so on.\n\nReaching close to the deity is the ultimate goal in sadhana for one adhering \nto Dwaita siddhanta (duality). For them, getting close to ishta devata, \nsecuring a place near the feet and seeing the entire world as emanating from \nthat deity is the highest goal. All gods and entire creation are extensions \nof that deity.\n\nFor some, there is a next stage: As you get closer and closer to the face \nyou picked, you finally merge with it! This is the ultimate goal in sadhana \nfor one adhering to Visishtaadwaita. You create a vaccum within yourself by \ncompleting killing ego-consciousness and the deity in question fills the \nvacuum.\n\nTo Advaitis, this communion with a Saguna (&quot;with attributes&quot;) form of God is \nnot the final goal. The final goal is to break through the face and jump \ninto the inside of the diamond. As you break through any face of the diamond \nand jump into the interior of the diamond, you no longer perceive the faces \nof the diamond or the world outside. There are no longer any objects or \nattributes. There is no I-ness or It-ness or experience. The experiencer, \nexperienced and experience all merge into one. The same thing happens \nirrespective of from which face the person jumped into the interior of the \ndiamond. Whether one enters a nirvikalpa samadhi through oneness with \nNarayana or through oneness with Sadashiva or through oneness with \nMahaganapathi, the state reached is identical. The path only is different.\n\nSome people can jump into the interior of this diamond without first \nexperiencing oneness with a face. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s Adwaitic guru \nTotapuri did not believe in any form and worshipped only the Formless \nReality. He would directly jump into the interior of the diamond in this \nanalogy. However, his disciple Ramakrishna Paramahamsa chose to first reach \noneness with Mother Kaali and then reach the interior of the diamond by \njumping from the face of the diamond representing Kaali. Both are valid \npaths.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI have written too much tonight. Let me end here now.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;shrivajra&quot; &lt;shrivajra@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, July 01, 2007 9:26 AM\nSubject: [sivacharya] Re: Will of Siva or karma?\n\n\n&gt; Dear mahahradanatha,\n&gt; You make a good point there. I always need to\n&gt; remind myself that Hinduism is a collection of\n&gt; philosophies and approaches which exist\n&gt; parallel to each other and may be grouped\n&gt; under a nominal title, like Shaivism.\n&gt;\n&gt; It&#39;s good to have a spread of opinion. My first\n&gt; brush with Shaivism was via a website dedicated\n&gt; to Swami Lakshmanjoo, the famous Kashmiri\n&gt; teacher who is, if I have understood it correctly,\n&gt; a monist. This has informed my expectations to\n&gt; some extent as I feel it resonates with Buddhism.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.universalshaivafellowship.org/index.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Would you consider the above site to be a fair\n&gt; representation of monist Shaivite teachings and\n&gt; who is considered to be the leading light of this\n&gt; approach nowadays?\n&gt;\n&gt; I am also in the process of reading the pdf file\n&gt; from this site&#39;s resources regarding Kashmiri\n&gt; culture.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Kris\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In sivacharya@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mahahradanatha&quot; &lt;mahahradanatha@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- I was under the assumption\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that within Shaivism all beings, in their true state,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; are inseparable from Siva but this is, perhaps,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; also a mistaken assumption, as it seems that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; only his &#39;avataara-s&#39; may be considered so.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Christianity islam and Buddhism  has  a  single founder and therefore\n&gt;&gt; there is no or very little variation to be found in their central\n&gt;&gt; doctrines.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You should become acquanted with the fact that Hinduism is different\n&gt;&gt; it has no single founder and no central doctrines that are shared by\n&gt;&gt; all,  also Shavaism is differnt and there are  many variations in\n&gt;&gt; doctrine.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One can broadly distinguish three variations of Hindu Philosophy\n&gt;&gt; which describe the relation between the jiva and the creator\n&gt;&gt; differently , broadly speaking they differ on the topic in the\n&gt;&gt; following way: either tzey postulate that there exist an ultimate\n&gt;&gt; unity, diversity, or unity in diversity, between the  undefined state\n&gt;&gt; of godhead (brahman) and the individualised jiva.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Also in shaivaism you will find these variations and also schools of\n&gt;&gt; thought,  like for instance the Siddha mata that considerd iverse\n&gt;&gt; philosophies as inferior to practice and put higher value on the\n&gt;&gt; experience caused by yoga and upasana and in this way transcend  all\n&gt;&gt; these diversities of opinion.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There is no school of thought in shaivaism i know of,  that\n&gt;&gt; postulates an identity of the crude &quot;unprocessed&quot; suffering jiva\n&gt;&gt; still bound by karma and kleshas and defilements with lord siva.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Recognition of an innate identity of jiva and siva, or the state of\n&gt;&gt; transcendece cum immannence, that is postulated to occur in\n&gt;&gt; consiousness by some schools of thought is  only achived after the\n&gt;&gt; jiva is cleaned of all karmas  defilements and conditioning. \n\n\n"}}
