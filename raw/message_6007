Even if you leave =\r\nyour room \n&gt;with &quot;Black Shades&quot; would be fine and actually more beautiful :=\r\n)\n&gt;***\n&gt;Answers to your questions:\n&gt;\n&gt;1) YES. It is portable. Every day I a=\r\ndjust it near my window and after finishing \n&gt;homam, i take it back little =\r\ninside so that window can be closed. I am able to \n&gt;adjust it myself alone =\r\nin just a few *seconds*.\n&gt;\n&gt;2) It is made of G.I Sheets (Galvanized Iron) o=\r\nf 22 Gauge. This was manufactured \n&gt;by a Local EPC contracting company deal=\r\ning in AC Duct installation. A Technical \n&gt;Supervisor of that company is my=\r\n close family friend. He did this for me. I \n&gt;suggest checking with any Res=\r\ntaurants. They all are having such arrangements and \n&gt;they would be able to=\r\n help you to contact such manufacturers.\n&gt;\n&gt;3) YES, because it is a Metal (=\r\nGI Sheet) it gets quite heated up. One can not \n&gt;touch during Homam. Howeve=\r\nr, it also cools down quickly. Within half an hour \n&gt;after Homam is finishe=\r\nd, temperature of the chimney comes down to room \n&gt;temperature. \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;4) It=\r\n has a Metallic FAN at the end. I was starting that FAN only when Fire goes=\r\n \n&gt;of and lot of Smoke is generated. Reasons are as follows:\n&gt;i)The fan is =\r\npowerful and makes a lot of noise which disturbs concentration.\n&gt;ii) In the=\r\n beginning, when Fire is very small, the powerful exhaust by the fan, \n&gt;dis=\r\nturbed the flames and sometimes extinguished it.\n&gt;1ii) When Fire is there i=\r\nn the Homam, one need not worry about smoke handling. \n&gt;the reason is that =\r\nthe smoke naturally travels upward and it is automatically \n&gt;guided to the =\r\nexit of the chimney. Once the fire becomes strong, it generates \n&gt;vacuum ar=\r\nound Homam kundam area and starts pulling outside air. For instance, \n&gt;smok=\r\ne from incense stick (Agarbatti), though outside of chimney and quite far \n=\r\n&gt;away, actually gets diverted into the Chimney via square opening at the bo=\r\nttom. \n&gt;Hence during homam, FAN is not required.\n&gt;\n&gt;iv) Now very important =\r\nthing. I used fan for many months (only at the end of \n&gt;Homas). One day my =\r\nfear proved right. Due to heat of chimney, the cable of the \n&gt;Fan got burnt=\r\n and there was a short-circuit. mccb tripped. Since then I am not \n&gt;using t=\r\nhe Fan. You may have to go for Heat resistant cable for the FAN if you \n&gt;wi=\r\nsh to use it but i am fine without using the fan in my chimney.\n&gt;Actually w=\r\nithout Fan, The whole arrangement will become much Lighter and much \n&gt;easie=\r\nr to handle. Please also do not forget to make a support. You can see that =\r\n\n&gt;in pictures which I have loaded.

I remember \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n different fears i was having in my mind. I was then staying as a paying gu=\r\nest \n\n&gt;&gt; with a family. though i had a separte room, i was not sure if they=\r\n would allow \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; me to do something related to fire. that was the main wo=\r\nrry. then there was \n&gt;&gt;self \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; doubt concerning my ability to perform H=\r\nomam but I decided to perform and did \n\n&gt;&gt; the first Homam which was Maha G=\r\nanapati homam on 1st day of Ashwin Navaraatri. \n&gt;&gt;I \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; remember that i =\r\ntook me around 2.5 hours total including all the preparation \n&gt;&gt; after that=\r\n rest of the 8 days, i performed Chandi Homams. each Chandi homam \n&gt;&gt;took \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; around 4 hours. I remember that on the Ashtami day, some of My collea=\r\ngues with \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; family came to see my chandi Homam and they told me that th=\r\ne smoke was even \n&gt;&gt; visible in the ground floor (The Apartment i was stayi=\r\nng was on 4th) and there \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; were nice smell every where. The interesting=\r\n thing is that Old lady of the \n&gt;&gt; family actually co-operated with me. she=\r\n used to help me in cutting Dray \n&gt;&gt;coconut \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in to small peices with =\r\nknife. I cut my finger on several occasions while \n&gt;&gt; cutting coconuts for =\r\nchandi homam. I used to offer the blood stained coconut \n&gt;&gt; peices in Chand=\r\ni Homas.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; My all previous fears thus proved absolutely Non-existent. =\r\nFrom the very first \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Homam, It was a smooth ride. I was exahusted afte=\r\nr Navaratri and could not \n&gt;&gt; continue and there was a break of a week or s=\r\no. Then again i started daily Maha \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ganapti Homam while learnt the te=\r\nchnic of breaking Dry coconut halves by \n&gt;&gt; crushing it with both palms.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; After few months, I had to look for another Sharing Apartment. I tried=\r\n to \n&gt;&gt;search \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; for it. few families rejected when i put the condition=\r\n of doing Homam everyday. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; at last One christian family agreed for th=\r\nat. I paid bigger amount but they \n&gt;&gt; allowed me to do homam and i continue=\r\nd there for around 3 months. during that \n\n&gt;&gt; time i also took vow to do ho=\r\nmam and Chadni Path everyday for 1 year.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; after 3 months, i started s=\r\nearching for my own separate Rental Apartment \n&gt;&gt;because \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; my family w=\r\nas joining me. Again the same concern (Prime) is to search for \n&gt;&gt; Apartmen=\r\nt where there is no obstacle to do Homam. I got a brand new apartment. \n&gt;&gt;I=\r\n \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; observed the flat and finalised the dealing. continued Homam every =\r\nday for 1 \n&gt;&gt; year. The whole flat became black. even the Home applicances =\r\nliem refrigerator \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; etc.. were covered with black dust of Homa smoke. c=\r\nlothes in the wardrobe, \n&gt;&gt; Openings of Central A/c etc... were all filled =\r\nwith black dust. My whole brand \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; new apartment became dark due to the =\r\nHomam. Smoke particles travelled to my \n&gt;&gt; lungs and throat and i started c=\r\noughing badly. I suffered with severe Cough for \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; many months and ther=\r\ne was pressure from near ones to stop Homam or atleast \n&gt;&gt; perform it once =\r\nevery week. But there was lot of determination provided by \n&gt;&gt;*some \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\npower* which i like to call as &quot;Mother&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; After 1 year in that Apartm=\r\nent, i started serching different place. I searched \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; whole area and wa=\r\ns looking for a apartment which also has Balcony so that My \n&gt;&gt; homam goes =\r\nsmoothly without nmaking my whole aprtment look black and there are \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; n=\r\no more complaints from my wife .\n&gt;&gt; I could not get one such perfect place =\r\nwhich gives me a Blacony and at the same \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; time there are no buidlings=\r\n in front which can observe me doing homam in \n&gt;&gt;balcony \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and make a =\r\ninstant complaint to police and/or fire Brigade. Balcony was very \n&gt;&gt; comfi=\r\nrtable and required option so that i can do it there and smoke handling \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n becomes very easy but at the same time it is also that much risky because =\r\nany \n\n&gt;&gt; road-side person can complain seeing smoke comming out.\n&gt;&gt; Finally=\r\n i got one aprtment without balcony but with a special location. When i \n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; vacated the previous apartment, the owner&#39;e representative was shell-sho=\r\ncked \n&gt;&gt; looking at the condition of the apartment :) He told me over Phone=\r\n - &quot;Aaap Kya \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; karata tha flat me?&quot;. He then deducted 1000 AED from my =\r\ndeposit for the \n&gt;&gt; compensation. I happily agreed because i knew that it w=\r\nas a great deal instaed \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; of going to police station.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; In new Apa=\r\nrtment (current one), security is very tight. But I decided to make \n&gt;&gt;an \n=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; arrangement so that i do not *spoil* condition of the Apartment. henc=\r\ne i came \n\n&gt;&gt; out with the Idea of Chimney. (Please see the more pictures i=\r\nn photo section) \n\n&gt;&gt; and started doing Homam. Though the chimney is visibl=\r\ne to neighbours and other \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; flat owners, no body has complained till no=\r\nw. neither to police nor to security \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; personnel. Only once Security p=\r\nerson cautiuoned me. I stopped for a few days \n&gt;&gt;and \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; started as usua=\r\nl. It is going on till today. I do not know about tomorrow but i \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; do =\r\nnot worry. becuase after 2.5 years of experience, it is more than clear to =\r\n\n&gt;&gt;me \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; that It is not I who is arranging all these but there is Mothe=\r\nr behind all \n&gt;&gt; these. SHE is making my road clear so that i can perform H=\r\nomam as i wish.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; ***\n&gt;&gt; The moral of the story is that if you genuine=\r\nly desire to perform Homam/Havan, \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; then It will be done. No obstacle w=\r\nill stand on your way.\n&gt;&gt; Do not fear. All the fears will break like Papads=\r\n once you start walking over \n\n&gt;&gt; them to do homam. i can swear for it!\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; No owner will kick you out, No neighbour will call 9-1-1 and even if th=\r\nat \n&gt;&gt; happens, there will open a way!\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Utpal\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n PS: Forgive me for spellings and Grammar! \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;astro_student75&quot; &lt;astro.sishya@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks very much for the photo.

Even if you leave your roo=\r\nm with &quot;Black Shades&quot; would be fine and actually more beautiful :)&lt;br&gt;***&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Answers to your questions:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;1) YES. It is portable. Every day I a=\r\ndjust it near my window and after finishing homam, i take it back little in=\r\nside so that window can be closed. I am able to adjust it myself alone in j=\r\nust a few *seconds*.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) It is made of G.I Sheets (Galvanized Iron) o=\r\nf 22 Gauge. This was manufactured by a Local EPC contracting company dealin=\r\ng in AC Duct installation. A Technical Supervisor of that company is my clo=\r\nse family friend. He did this for me. I suggest checking with any Restauran=\r\nts. They all are having such arrangements and they would be able to help yo=\r\nu to contact such manufacturers.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;3) YES, because it is a Metal (GI=\r\n Sheet) it gets quite heated up. One can not touch during Homam. However, i=\r\nt also cools down quickly. Within half an hour after Homam is finished, tem=\r\nperature of the chimney comes down to room temperature. &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;4) It has=\r\n a Metallic FAN at the end. I was starting that FAN only when Fire goes of =\r\nand lot of Smoke is generated. Reasons are as follows:&lt;br&gt;i)The fan is powe=\r\nrful and makes a lot of noise which disturbs concentration.&lt;br&gt;\n\nii) In the=\r\n beginning, when Fire is very small, the powerful exhaust by the fan, distu=\r\nrbed the flames and sometimes extinguished it.&lt;br&gt;1ii) When Fire is there i=\r\nn the Homam, one need not worry about smoke handling. the reason is that th=\r\ne smoke naturally travels upward and it is automatically guided to the exit=\r\n of the chimney. Once the fire becomes strong, it generates vacuum around H=\r\nomam kundam area and starts pulling outside air. For instance, smoke from i=\r\nncense stick (Agarbatti), though outside of chimney and quite far away, act=\r\nually gets diverted into the Chimney via square opening at the bottom. Henc=\r\ne during homam, FAN is not required.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;iv) Now very important thing.=\r\n I used fan for many months (only at the end of Homas). One day my fear pro=\r\nved right. Due to heat of chimney, the cable of the Fan got burnt and there=\r\n was a short-circuit. mccb tripped. Since then I am not using the Fan. You =\r\nmay have to go for Heat resistant cable for the FAN if you wish to use it b=\r\nut i am fine without using the fan in my chimney.&lt;br&gt;\n\nActually without Fan=\r\n, The whole arrangement will become much Lighter and much easier to handle.=\r\n Please also do not forget to make a support. You can see that in pictures =\r\nwhich I have loaded. Support is a separate part&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;(Please check the =\r\nPicture of Fan which i have added in the Photo section)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have =\r\nfurther queries, please do not hesitate to ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Utpal \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:ve=\r\ndic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Girish Sund=\r\naram &lt;gisundar@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaskaram Phatakji,&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; You know what I am faced with the same problem that you had (and I am su=\r\nre many &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; others doing regular homam do)..

I am inspired to write my story in this regard. Hoping &lt;br&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhat it can inspire somebody on the list and removes mainly the fear factor.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; ***&lt;br&gt;&gt; about 2.5 years back, Narasimha wrote to me=\r\n this: &quot;Do whatever compromises, but &lt;br&gt;&gt; 20 minutues Homam every day i=\r\ns a must. find out ways to do that&quot;. I remember &lt;br&gt;&gt; different fears i =\r\nwas having in my mind. I was then staying as a paying guest &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; with=\r\n a family. though i had a separte room, i was not sure if they would allow =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; me to do something related to fire. that was the main worry. then =\r\nthere was self &lt;br&gt;&gt; doubt concerning my ability to perform Homam but I =\r\ndecided to perform and did &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; the first Homam which was Maha Ganapa=\r\nti homam on 1st day of Ashwin Navaraatri. I &lt;br&gt;&gt; remember that i took m=\r\ne around 2.5 hours total including all the preparation &lt;br&gt;&gt; after that =\r\nrest of the 8 days, i performed Chandi Homams. each Chandi homam took &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\n&gt; around 4 hours. I remember that on the Ashtami day, some of My collea=\r\ngues with &lt;br&gt;&gt; family came to see my chandi Homam and they told me that=\r\n the smoke was even &lt;br&gt;&gt; visible in the ground floor (The Apartment i w=\r\nas staying was on 4th) and there &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; were nice smell every where. Th=\r\ne interesting thing is that Old lady of the &lt;br&gt;&gt; family actually co-ope=\r\nrated with me. she used to help me in cutting Dray coconut &lt;br&gt;&gt; in to s=\r\nmall peices with knife. I cut my finger on several occasions while &lt;br&gt;\n\n&g=\r\nt; cutting coconuts for chandi homam. I used to offer the blood stained coc=\r\nonut &lt;br&gt;&gt; peices in Chandi Homas.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; My all previous fear=\r\ns thus proved absolutely Non-existent. From the very first &lt;br&gt;&gt; Homam, =\r\nIt was a smooth ride. I was exahusted after Navaratri and could not &lt;br&gt;\n\n&=\r\ngt; continue and there was a break of a week or so. Then again i started da=\r\nily Maha &lt;br&gt;&gt; Ganapti Homam while learnt the technic of breaking Dry co=\r\nconut halves by &lt;br&gt;&gt; crushing it with both palms.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Afte=\r\nr few months, I had to look for another Sharing Apartment. I tried to searc=\r\nh &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; for it. few families rejected when i put the condition of doin=\r\ng Homam everyday. &lt;br&gt;&gt; at last One christian family agreed for that. I =\r\npaid bigger amount but they &lt;br&gt;&gt; allowed me to do homam and i continued=\r\n there for around 3 months. during that &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; time i also took vow to =\r\ndo homam and Chadni Path everyday for 1 year.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; after 3 mont=\r\nhs, i started searching for my own separate Rental Apartment because &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; my family was joining me. Again the same concern (Prime) is to search fo=\r\nr &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; Apartment where there is no obstacle to do Homam. I got a bran=\r\nd new apartment. I &lt;br&gt;&gt; observed the flat and finalised the dealing. co=\r\nntinued Homam every day for 1 &lt;br&gt;&gt; year. The whole flat became black. e=\r\nven the Home applicances liem refrigerator &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; etc.. were covered wi=\r\nth black dust of Homa smoke. clothes in the wardrobe, &lt;br&gt;&gt; Openings of =\r\nCentral A/c etc... were all filled with black dust. My whole brand &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n new apartment became dark due to the Homam. Smoke particles travelled to m=\r\ny &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; lungs and throat and i started coughing badly. I suffered with=\r\n severe Cough for &lt;br&gt;&gt; many months and there was pressure from near one=\r\ns to stop Homam or atleast &lt;br&gt;&gt; perform it once every week. But there w=\r\nas lot of determination provided by *some &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; power* which i like to=\r\n call as &quot;Mother&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; After 1 year in that Apartment, i start=\r\ned serching different place. I searched &lt;br&gt;&gt; whole area and was looking=\r\n for a apartment which also has Balcony so that My &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; homam goes sm=\r\noothly without nmaking my whole aprtment look black and there are &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nno more complaints from my wife .&lt;br&gt;&gt; I could not get one such perfect =\r\nplace which gives me a Blacony and at the same &lt;br&gt;&gt; time there are no b=\r\nuidlings in front which can observe me doing homam in balcony &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; an=\r\nd make a instant complaint to police and/or fire Brigade. Balcony was very =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; comfirtable and required option so that i can do it there and smok=\r\ne handling &lt;br&gt;&gt; becomes very easy but at the same time it is also that =\r\nmuch risky because any &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; road-side person can complain seeing smok=\r\ne comming out.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Finally i got one aprtment without balcony but with =\r\na special location. When i &lt;br&gt;&gt; vacated the previous apartment, the own=\r\ner&#39;e representative was shell-shocked &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; looking at the condition o=\r\nf the apartment :) He told me over Phone - &quot;Aaap Kya &lt;br&gt;&gt; karata tha fl=\r\nat me?&quot;. He then deducted 1000 AED from my deposit for the &lt;br&gt;&gt; compens=\r\nation. I happily agreed because i knew that it was a great deal instaed &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&gt; of going to police station.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; In new Apartment (curr=\r\nent one), security is very tight. But I decided to make an &lt;br&gt;&gt; arrange=\r\nment so that i do not *spoil* condition of the Apartment. hence i came &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&gt; out with the Idea of Chimney. (Please see the more pictures in photo=\r\n section) &lt;br&gt;&gt; and started doing Homam. Though the chimney is visible t=\r\no neighbours and other &lt;br&gt;&gt; flat owners, no body has complained till no=\r\nw. neither to police nor to security &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; personnel. Only once Securi=\r\nty person cautiuoned me. I stopped for a few days and &lt;br&gt;&gt; started as u=\r\nsual. It is going on till today. I do not know about tomorrow but i &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; do not worry. becuase after 2.5 years of experience, it is more than clea=\r\nr to me &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; that It is not I who is arranging all these but there is=\r\n Mother behind all &lt;br&gt;&gt; these. SHE is making my road clear so that i ca=\r\nn perform Homam as i wish.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; ***&lt;br&gt;&gt; The moral of the st=\r\nory is that if you genuinely desire to perform Homam/Havan, &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; then=\r\n It will be done. No obstacle will stand on your way.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Do not fear. =\r\nAll the fears will break like Papads once you start walking over &lt;br&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhem to do homam. i can swear for it!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; No owner will kick yo=\r\nu out, No neighbour will call 9-1-1 and even if that &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; happens, th=\r\nere will open a way!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Best Regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Utpal&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; PS: Forgive me for spellings and Grammar! &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; --- In =\r\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;astro_student75&quot; &lt;astro.sishya@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks very much fo=\r\nr the photo.
