At one stage, you said &quot;Ahamkara isn&#39;t the dominant cause of I-ness in Astral/Causal bodies&quot;, while I was saying ahamkara=I-ness. Now, you wrote:\n \n&gt;   PHYSICAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA)  = ASMITA   = Physical Egotism\n&gt;   ASTRAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  = MANAS    = Astral attachments\n&gt;   CAUSAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  = CHITTA   = Causal Perceptions\n \nSo you are acknowledging that I-ness and ahamkara are synonyms and referring to ahamkara at astral and causal planes. It is good that you are slowly converging!\n \n*        *        *\n \nI did not want to divert from the upanishadic terminology of 19 ideas of individualized consciousness. So I stuck to the term ahamkaara and ignored your references to Patanjali. Now that there is some convergence on &quot;ahamkaara&quot;, let me address &quot;asmita&quot; mentioned in Patanjali yoga sutras.\n \n&gt; identification of the seer with the instrument of\n&gt; seeing i.e. Physical senses.\n \nYou are assuming that physical senses or physical body is the only instrument of seeing (or experiencing).\n \nHowever, mind can see, hear, feel and experience things even when it is not working with a physical body and physical senses. For example, one&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; something in a dream without the physical eyes seeing anything.\n \nAlso, a yogi in deep meditation may see, hear, feel or experience something without the involvement of eyes, ears and other physical senses.\n \nIf such a yogi identifies with the instrument of that experience, i.e. the mind, that too is asmita as per Patanjali&#39;s yoga sutra that you quoted. Just as I had an issue earlier with your limiting of ahamkaara to physical body, I also have an issue with your limiting of asmita to physical body.\n \nBTW, identification with physical body *as well as* identification with mind block one from yoga (communion) with true Self. Both are due to ahamkaara as defined by upanishads. Both are due to asmita as defined by Patanjali.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; Dear Utpalji and Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt;    If any of you is offended due to my being explicit with words - it also shows that you people have a lot of scope in learning of new ideas!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The second statement says something radical. Ahamkaara and I Ness \n&gt; &gt; is completely two different identity.\n&gt; &gt; your second statment is a departure from almost every Gnyaani has \n&gt; &gt; to say.\n&gt; \n&gt;    It is none of my fault that this conflict arose and continues. Here is the reason.\n&gt; \n&gt;    In my first mail (#2704) itself it is explicitly written, that Patanjali has used the exact word &quot;asmita&quot; for Egoism - which is the I-ness (Ahamkara) in Physical body consciousness - that causes identification of the seer with the instrument of seeing i.e. Physical senses.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyorekatmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instrument of \n&gt; &gt; seeing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   PATANJALI has not used the word AHAMKARA anywhere in his PRECISE AND ESTEEMED sanskrit dissertation on YOGA - he has chosen to use the word ASMITA everywhere. E.g.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.  vitarka vicharanandasmita rupanugamat samprajnatah -\n&gt; \n&gt;                  SASMITA SAMADHI\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.  From Lahiri Mahasayas&#39; Commentary on Patanjali - \n&gt; \n&gt;   avidyasmitaragadveshabhinibeshah panchakleshah\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Avidya&quot; [ignorance], &quot;asmita&quot; [egotism], &quot;raga&quot; [attraction or \n&gt;  liking], &quot;dvesha&quot; [hatred or disliking] and &quot;abhinibesha&quot;  [engrossment] -- these are the five types of afflictions.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Thus, using &quot;Ahamkara&quot; while talking about Sankhya and using &quot;Asmita&quot; while talking about Patanjali Sutras brought in the conflict. In any case, what is called as Ahamkara in 24 principles of Sankhya is actually Asmita, which can be very-loosely pitted as Ahamkara.\n&gt; \n&gt;   The idea stated by me was on firm grounds - with reference to Patanjali Sutras and the words of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi. And this idea is there in my first mail, though not the exact table: \n&gt; \n&gt;   PHYSICAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA)  = ASMITA   = Physical Egotism\n&gt;   ASTRAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  = MANAS    = Astral attachments\n&gt;   CAUSAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  = CHITTA   = Causal Perceptions\n&gt; \n&gt;   Also, one of the 2 reasons that I had given on why Astral/Causal Body beings don&#39;t have sense of Asmita as a dominant sense of I-ness is this:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to \n&gt; &gt; see, hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a \n&gt; &gt; Yogi)... the sense of egoism does not take roots in the astral-body &gt; and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karma.\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is \n&gt; &gt; associated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has \n&gt; &gt; Physical Karma.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Lastly, extending upon this idea further, there are beings in the Astral cosmos who have never been in Physical forms - We Physical beings are not the only ones in the cycles of creation. While they will still have the idea of &quot;Asmita&quot; in their causal bodies, but they will always be repelled by the grosser-vibrations of Sensual experiences in Physical Bodies/Cosmos, and hence would not incur any Physical Karma due to &quot;Asmita&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; [ TO ALL IN THE LIST ]  \n&gt;   - If the above explanation resolves the issue, well and good. Whether it does or doesn&#39;t, this is my last mail on this topic because I had said all I had to in the first mail itself - whether you read it or missed it.\n&gt;   You may read a detailed article on this topic that I will write as and when time allows me to do so.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; [ TO UTPALJI ]\n&gt;       - Am not a jnani.\n&gt;         But there are Jnanis, who know that 6th tattwa doesn&#39;t exist.\n&gt;         That is why there is a significant departure.\n&gt; \n&gt; [ TO NARASIMHA ]\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; So you are accepting that there as &quot;I-ness of manas&quot; and &quot;I-ness of &gt; chitta&quot;.

But unfortunately that \n&gt; &gt; programmer seems to be hasty in using labels like &quot;flawed&quot;, \n&gt; &gt; &quot;incorrect&quot;, &quot;incoherent&quot; etc about other programmers whose \n&gt; &gt; language he is unable to understand.\n&gt; \n&gt;    The power of mind needs no language to express itself...If a Programmer just understands this much, he will become the Architect!\n&gt;    Also, while a Programmer always assumes that every other person he encounters is a Programmer, an Architect knows that every other person is an Architect in making.

After all,\n&gt;  \n&gt; aham = I\n&gt; kaara = ness\n&gt; ahamkaara = I-ness.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thus, ahamkaara *IS* the I-ness of an individualized consciousness. You are talking of ahamkaara being the &quot;cause of&quot; I-ness. But ahamkaara IS the I-ness!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Whether you talk about physical body or subtle body or causal body, I-ness in various layers is still ahamkaara. When ahamkaara binds more to one layer, one looks at oneself primarily from the perspective of that layer. When ahamkaara does not bind to anything at all, one is in nirvikalpa samadhi, i.e. established in Brahman. Ahamkaara or I-ness is a fundamental property of an individualized consciousness and remains as long as there is some individualization.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;     THUS, THE BEAUTIFUL ASTRAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF MANAS,\n&gt; &gt; while CAUSAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF CHITTA.\n&gt;  \n&gt; So you are accepting that there as &quot;I-ness of manas&quot; and &quot;I-ness of chitta&quot;. I-ness=aham-kaara. If we replace I-ness in these terms, we get &quot;ahamkaara of manas&quot; and &quot;ahamkaara of chitta&quot;. When scriptures defined the 19 proerties of individualized consciousness, they only defined one ahamkaara apart from manas, chitta etc and did not define &quot;ahamkaara of manas&quot; and &quot;ahamkaara of chitta&quot; etc.\n&gt;  \n&gt; For what I termed as ahamkaara (I-ness) working through manas and ahamkaara (I-ness) working through chitta, you are coining new terms like &quot;I-ness of manas&quot; and &quot;I-ness of chitta&quot; because you have this strange notion that ahamkaara is tied to physical body.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;    IF THE AHAMKARA IS NOT SUPPRESSED AFTER PHYSICAL DEATH, THE PERSON WILL\n&gt; &gt; KEEP CARRYING THE SAME EARTHLY IDENTITY TO THE ASTRAL PLANES, AND BRING IT\n&gt; &gt; BACK AT REBIRTH TO THE EARTH.

I-ness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has no innate power to Control any other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reason:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Soul is the only Truth and controller, everything else has an unreal and derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate with each other, and not control each other. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. A new-born child or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sense-consciousness coherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived from Manas, that coordinates the senses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty to interact with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you have proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of I-ness, not due to Buddhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of individualized consciousness, which one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of course not! If someone says &quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel offended or if someone says &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one may feel elated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or praise, even though nothing is being done to the physical body and only a name is being used. When somebody calls one by name from distance (as opposed to patting on the physical body and calling), one&#39;s consciousness may still think &quot;I am being called&quot; and one may turn towards the caller. As in these examples, one&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself to more than a body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping. One may have forgotten totally about the physical body in the dream! One may think of something else as &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a different body or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one may have the sense that so and so thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away from the physical body, there is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is absolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have physical bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he would not do everything he does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individualized consciousness do interact with each other, whether we use the word &quot;control&quot; for some of those interactions or not. For example, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges various past experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do various things. My buddhi determined what to write and my manas told my hands to type this and I ended up typing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totally out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts of individualized consciousness and they play different roles while interacting with each other in different ways. Some of those interactions may be deemed to be controls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in details. Your understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One does not &quot;read up&quot; these things in a single place. There are different abstractions and breakdowns of what happens in individualized consciousness. There are several sources that speak of different aspects of this knowledge in slightly different terms. One will assimilate this knowledge better if one reads as many sources as possible and contemplates.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@ ...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please Ignore my previous-mail, it was not completed - i will try to delete it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t go in details. Your understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the ideational or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the physical body (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a physical/astral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara like we do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a fine line between the sense of I-ness attributed to the Individual Soul and the sense of I-ness derived through the idea of Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), while it has already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Individuality of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, without requiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always interfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces and are not related as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is independent of the application of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upon that particular idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individualized consciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as for an astral/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An Astral-bodied being thinks of Manas/sense- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/perceptive- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, that individuality is of the Soul not derived from any idea, which is why it is not lost when the Astral being loses astral consciousness and reincarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an example, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are able to work through all the beings in all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never getting controlled by Ahamkara that would require them to say that this particular body is &quot;my body&quot; or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies themselves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so they would attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; physical body as well as act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 functions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical body (16 chemical elements).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as we all know that Physical body expires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising it go away at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whole in the corresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of different constituent ideas slipping out of it at different times. Chitta being the staging idea for all other modifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the causal body is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manas with Subtle Astral vibrations and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta with infinitely Subtle Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi being another variable, can be developed or undeveloped irrespective of the other 34. Even illiterate Moodha, through surrender to their Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkara and so on...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store the residual impressions of all the past incarnations. However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container containing an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana is required for That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Samskaras stored by Chitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all residual impressions, only Satva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on itself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its own nature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore katmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instrument of seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of egoism does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is associated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousness , must be overcome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who cannot be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-consciousness which is associated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in the same manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dristanushravika vishaya vitrishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That effect which comes to these who have given up their thirst after objects, either seen or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non-attachment. Vivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to Astral-Body and working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as an astral-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yogashchittavrittin irodhah -2-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, extinguishing all the movements of Chitta is called &quot;Yoga&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciousness to Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or otherwise as a causal-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n\n\n"}}
