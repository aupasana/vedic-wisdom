They bestow different aspects of Supreme Knowledge. \nWorshipping them for winning a court case or getting a job (which many \npeople try to do today) is like trying to use a missile to crush an ant.\n\nRegarding your dream, it may be genuine or merely a projection of your \nmind. Remember that mind is very powerful and projects various conscious \nand sub-conscious conditioning as its experiences, especially in a \ndream.\n\nIf you feel that the dream is a genuine experience of the devata, then \nkeep doing the mantra and see what happens.\n\nIf you had the same experience with another mahavidya, it is possible \nthat your mind is just projecting. If your mind has affinity to a soumya \ndevata with certain nature, it may imagine whichever devata you worship \nto have that nature!\n\nIf your mind is imagining an Ugra devata as a benign smiling form, \nperhaps you should stick to a Soumya Devata. If the devata really gives \nyou a darshan in a fierce form, is your mind capable of handling it? If \nyour mind can visualize and perceive an Ugra Devata in a truly fierce \nform and yet feel deep love and surrender for her, then only you are \nsuitable for such a sadhana.\n\nGood luck in your sadhana!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the  Mahavidyas I got a mantra from an astrologer and did it \n&gt; for 40 days, but with 5 days of\n&gt; sadhana, it&#39;s was so cool , but got a real vison in dream of what they \n&gt; call ugra devata , but Smiling\n&gt; at me???  What does that mean since Mahavidya worship is NOT \n&gt; recommended by you. Should I do intense\n&gt; worship of that devata?\n&gt;\n&gt; Before this few years back I had somebody give same mahavidya mantra \n&gt; and did and got a very same\n&gt; experience,,,, what does this mean??\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you please guide\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n\n"}}
