I cared very little for the body.\n&gt; My longing for the Divine Mother was so great that I would not eat or sleep.\n&gt; I would lie on the bare ground, placing my head on a lump of earth, and cry\n&gt; out loudly: &quot;Mother, Mother, why dost Thou not come to me?&quot; I did not know\n&gt; how the days and nights passed away. I used to have ecstasy all the time.\n&gt; I saw my disciples as my own people, like children and relations, long\n&gt; before they came to me. I used to cry before my Mother, saying: &quot;O Mother! I\n&gt; am dying for my beloved ones (Bhaktas); do Thou bring them to me as quickly\n&gt; as possible.&quot; [p. 208]\n&gt;\n&gt; All desires fulfilled\n&gt;\n&gt; At that time whatever I desired came to pass. Once I desired to build a\n&gt; small hut in the Panchavati [**] for meditation and to put a fence around\n&gt; it.Immediately after I saw a huge bundle of bamboo sticks, rope, strings and\n&gt; even a knife, all brought by the tide in front of the Panchavati. A servant\n&gt; of the Temple, seeing these things, ran to me with great delight and told me\n&gt; of them. There was the exact quantity of material necessary for the hut and\n&gt; the fence.\n&gt;\n&gt; When they were built, nothing remained over. Everyone was amazed to see\n&gt; this wonderful sight. When I reached the state of continuous ecstasy, I gave\n&gt; up all\n&gt; external forms of worship; I could no longer perform them. Then I prayed to\n&gt; my Divine Mother: &quot;Mother, who will now take care of me? I have no power to\n&gt; take care of myself. I like to hear Thy name and feed Thy Bhaktas and help\n&gt; the poor. Who will make it possible for me to do these things? Send me\n&gt; someone who will be able to do these for me.&quot; As the answer to this prayer\n&gt; came Mathura Babu, [*+] who served me so long and with such intense devotion\n&gt; and faith! Again at another time I said to the Mother: &quot;I shall have no\n&gt; child of my own, but I wish to have as my child a pitre Bhakta, who will\n&gt; stay with me all the time. Send me such an one.&quot; Then came Rakhal\n&gt; (Brahmananda). Those who are my own are parts of my very Self. [p. 209]\n&gt;\n&gt; Distaste for Worldly conversation\n&gt;\n&gt; Nothing but discourses on God appealed to me at this period. If I heard\n&gt; worldly conversation, I would sit in a corner and weep bitterly. When I\n&gt; went with Mathura Babu to Benares, I was sitting with him in the\n&gt; drawing-room when some friends came in to see him and began to discuss\n&gt; worldly affairs. &quot;So much we have gained, so much we have lost.&quot; Hearing\n&gt; this I was in tears and cried aloud: &quot;Mother, why hast Thou brought me here?\n&gt; I was much better off in the Temple.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have come to the Holy City to hear only of lust and gold; but there in\n&gt; the Temple I did not have to listen to such conversation.&quot; I was at this\n&gt; time like a young boy and so Mathura Babu fulfilled all the desires that\n&gt; arose in my mind. My heart and soul, however, were constantly longing to\n&gt; hear about the Supreme Being. [p. 216]\n&gt;\n&gt; Longing to hear about the Supreme\n&gt;\n&gt; I searched for the places where the Holy Scriptures were expounded. There\n&gt; was a Brahmin in the neighborhood who was a great pandit and who had true\n&gt; faith. I used to go to hear him very often. A saint lived near by on the\n&gt; bank of the Ganges and I wished to go with this Brahmin to see him; but a\n&gt; priest who looked upon the world as a dream discouraged me by saying: &quot;The\n&gt; body of a saint is an earthly cage; what good can one obtain by visiting\n&gt; such a cage?&quot; I spoke of this to the Brahmin and he replied: &quot;He who thinks\n&gt; of God, he who repeats His Holy Name and has renounced everything for the\n&gt; sake of the Lord, must not be regarded as an earthly cage. The priest does\n&gt; not know that the form of a devotee is a spiritual form full of Divine\n&gt; intelligence.&quot;This Brahmin once asked me why I had thrown away my\n&gt; Brahminical thread. I replied: &quot;When the storm of Divine ecstasy overtook my\n&gt; heart and soul, it blew away all signs of caste and creed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Absolute frankness\n&gt;\n&gt; During this period I was absolutely outspoken. I observed no formality or\n&gt; etiquette; I was fearless. Once I met a rich Zemindar and asked him: &quot;What\n&gt; is our highest duty? Is not the attainment of God our highest duty?&quot; He\n&gt; replied: &quot;We are men of the world; salvation is not for us. When even\n&gt; Yudhisthira, [**] the purest and most perfect of mortals, had to see\n&gt; purgatory in a vision because he had once wavered for half a second from\n&gt; absolute Truth, what can we expect for ourselves?&quot; I could not bear his\n&gt; words and rebuked him sharply, saying: &quot;What kind of man are you that you\n&gt; think of the momentary vision of purgatory?\n&gt;\n&gt; You must not think of that, but of Yudhisthira&#39;s truthfulness, forgiveness,\n&gt; patience, right discrimination, renunciation, devotion and love for God.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; At another time I went to see a Zemindar who had the title of Raja, and I\n&gt; told him plainly that I could not call him Raja because he was not really\n&gt; one. One day I saw a pious Brahmin who was counting his beads on the bank of\n&gt; the Ganges. I stood near him and knew that his mind was not fixed on God but\n&gt; on earthly things. Immediately I roused him by striking him on the shoulder.\n&gt; At another time Rashmoni, the founder of the Temple, was praying in the\n&gt; Temple while I was singing the holy song of the Divine Mother. I perceived\n&gt; that her mind was on worldly objects and instantly I roused her in the same\n&gt; manner. In amazement she folded her hands and remained motionless before me.\n&gt; vii [p. 218 & 219]\n&gt;\n&gt; Source: THE GOSPEL OF RAMAKRISHNA Revised by SWAMI ABHEDANANDA\n&gt;\n&gt; --\n&gt; Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\n&gt; Prasanth Jalasutram\n&gt;\n&gt; Love And Love Alone\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--001636426c87da3d520476abd566\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nexcellence of the post is beyond words.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;O=\r\nn Sat, Oct 24, 2009 at 12:51 PM, Prasanth Jalasutram &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:jvrsprasanth@...&quot;&gt;jvrsprasanth@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8e=\r\nx;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;ba=\r\nckground-color:#ffffff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;width:655px&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n style=3D&quot;width:470px;margin:0;padding:0 25px 0 0;float:left&quot;&gt;\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n =\r\n                 &lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;f=\r\nont-size:13px;color:rgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-w=\r\neight:bold&quot;&gt;Days of struggle&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;=\r\n&gt;I practised austerities for a long time.
