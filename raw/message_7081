I heard from one of the vendor that while the=\r\ny dry the coconut pieces, they do apply some chemicals in which to avoid fu=\r\nngi and ants attraction. Recently i bought 20 kgs of dry coconut and i made=\r\n them into tiny pieces for offering and i preserved. i didnt find any spoil=\r\ned stuff within.\n\nFor Poornahuthi you can easily jugde by pressing the full=\r\n coconut to identify whether it is spoiled or not. If it is spoiled very ea=\r\nsliy it would break into pieces,if not, it is bit hard to do so.Try it.\n\n\nA=\r\nll the best,\n\nThank you,\nSrini.\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Jyotis=\r\na Shisya &lt;achyutagaddi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Jitender, namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; I always=\r\n throw away those copras which have some dry powder/fungi inside it.\n&gt; As f=\r\nor full coconut, as Rama said, I generally use a half coconut as\n&gt; poornahu=\r\nti.
