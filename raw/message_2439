You don&#39;t have to explicitly try to extinguish it.\nDoing =\r\nhomam in US or other cold countries, can be tricky. Firstly I\nsuggest using=\r\n copra as it doesn&#39;t produce much smoke. Secondly, after\nyou&#39;re comfortable=\r\n with the homam content and fire management, you will\nbe able to optimize o=\r\nn the copra usage and reduce the smoke further.\nUsing camphor can also prod=\r\nuce much smoke, so use it sparingly. Ensure,\nyou raise the window&#39;s a bit, =\r\nso that there&#39;s circulation in the house.\nHowever, please ensure that wind =\r\nis not blowing in the direction of\nsmoke alarm, as this would cause it to r=\r\naise the alarm. For example,\nonce I performed Ganesha Homam with windows cl=\r\nose as it was very cold\noutside, by the end of it the room got stuffier, an=\r\nd when I opened the\nwindows a bit in both the rooms, the wind caused all th=\r\ne smoke in one\ndirection, passing the smoke alarm causing it to go off!\nOnc=\r\ne the homam is over, you can go ahead and place the kundam in the\nbalcony, =\r\nprovided there&#39;s no fire in it. So, please wait the fire to die\nand then mo=\r\nve it outside, as we don&#39;t want to attract any attention.\nPeople in western=\r\n continent are not aware of fire rituals, and can freak\nout on seeing fire.=\r\n So. when you perform homam in the night, please\nensure some light is on, o=\r\ntherwise if the lights are off, then one can\nsee the flames from outside th=\r\ne apartment, causing some people to call\nthe fire department. We certainly =\r\ndont want to get into such a\nsituation!\nToo much of clarified butter (ghee)=\r\n can also cause too much smoke. The\nghee has to be poured the right amount.=\r\n It would also help, if you could\nclean up the homa kundam so that you star=\r\nt empty. This also reduces\nsmoke. Also proficiency in estimating the amount=\r\n of ghee for a size of\ncopra to keep the fire going (including turning at t=\r\nhe right moment) all\nhelps reducing the residual smoke effect.\nSo, with mor=\r\ne practice you will get a better idea on all the above\nparameters. Others m=\r\nay add their experience. If you have any more\nquestions, please feel free t=\r\no ask.\nFinally, I would like to mention, that the smoke from the homa kunda=\r\nm is\nvery therapeutic in nature and offers a lot of benefits.
