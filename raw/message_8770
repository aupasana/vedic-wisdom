But it is surprising that the process o=\r\nf homam itself has led me to situations that have made me realize I was wro=\r\nng and thus understand God a little better.  How can I ever thank Homam in =\r\nwords? It that has led me progressively step by step and gently through thi=\r\ns.\n\nHowever my thought about homam becomes clear with 2 analogies below: \n1=\r\n.\tHigh tension power lines are great stuff that transmit power over long di=\r\nstances with lesser power wasteadge. But if one were to connect high tensio=\r\nn power line to a Zero watt bulb, what would be the state of the bulb? I am=\r\n a zero watt bulb. I know that for sure.\n2.\tIf one were to plant a seed, it=\r\n should be done such that it is watered frequently, not fed too much fertil=\r\nizer. When the same seed becomes a tree, it wouldn&#39;t care about the rules o=\r\nf frequent watering. It can bear all the fertilizers that you feed it. I th=\r\nink of homama in this way based on my experience this way. I am just a smal=\r\nl plant  that cannot take all the fertilizer straight away. All the pre-req=\r\nuisite Japa done as per the ratio enables me to do the homam (i.e. take the=\r\n strong fertilizer) with ease.\n\nThis is how the meaning of the 10:1 ratio p=\r\nre-requisite has turned out for me rather than the way you have spelt out f=\r\nrom the homam manual.\n\nHaving started the homam without caring much about t=\r\nhe rules, I have come to a point that the rules might exist for a certain r=\r\neason and we should not reinterpret them the way we find convenient.  For e=\r\n.g. When Achamana is good, why do we do only 3 times achamana? Why do we gi=\r\nve  only 3 times surya-arghya in Sandhyavandanam?\n\nThe rules should not beg=\r\net fear. Rather we should think of them as qualifications that one has to m=\r\neet to proceed ahead. It should make our resolve stronger, submission to Go=\r\nd more.\n\nRegards,\nAshutosh\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;surajyg&quot; =\r\n&lt;jyothikasooraj@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi\n&gt; Sri Narasimha ji has already written i=\r\nn the manuals.\n&gt; &quot;Misconception: Before doing homam with any mantra, one mu=\r\nst do japam of that mantra by a count that is ten times the homam count. Fo=\r\nr example, one must do japam by a count of 10,000 before one does homam by =\r\na count of 1,000.\n&gt; Comment: This convention is not without reason. The tru=\r\ne meaning of this convention is that homam is ten times more powerful than =\r\njapam. If one does a mantra 1,000 in a homam, it is equivalent to doing the=\r\n mantra 10,000 in japam. If one wants, one can offer the mantra entirely in=\r\n external fire and there is no need to do any japam before doing homam.\n&gt; A=\r\nll thumb rules and conventions have exceptions. If a rishi with a very stro=\r\nng bhootaagni does japam, it is equivalent to a homam and the &quot;ten times&quot; r=\r\nule does not apply. However, for most normal people, homam is ten times mor=\r\ne powerful than japam. The bottomline is that the strength and the purity o=\r\nf the medium that accommodates the presence of the deity who receives the m=\r\nantra will decide the effectiveness of the mantra.&quot;\n&gt; I personally feel tha=\r\nt the rules and regulations present in Hinduism will only deter many seeker=\r\ns.Fear is already a big part in our life.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ashutosh.srikanth&quot; &lt;ashutosh.srikanth@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; My pranams to all.\n&gt; &gt; I have been performing weekly havan for more than=\r\n a year and half.\n&gt; &gt; I want to point out certain things related to havan s=\r\no that it can be done as per shastra by others too.\n&gt; &gt; I am using a conver=\r\nsation that in fact took place to bring out these relevant points.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Sometime back there was informal &quot;prashNa&quot; session whose summary I am pres=\r\nenting below: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; [South Indians might be familiar with similar &quot;ashT=\r\namangala prashNa&quot; conducted in temples when something goes wrong - called a=\r\ns dosha.]\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a dosha... Hmm... l=\r\net me see... Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Agni karya=\r\n at your home regularly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Yes (I was actually very surprise=\r\nd by this pointed question because I had not told anybody about the havan I=\r\n did at home)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: There are certain errors in the a=\r\ngni karya you are doing. You seem to be using dry samith materials. And you=\r\nr ahuti does not seem to be right.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Yes I am using Til (ses=\r\name seeds).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: You should mix that with atleast a =\r\nlittle bit of ghee before giving it as ahuti.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Ok. And what=\r\n is the dosha in my ahuti apart from that?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Do y=\r\nou do required Japa before giving ahutis? And do you do the ahuti with the =\r\nsame mantra that you use for your regular japa?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: What?... R=\r\nequired Japa? Is there a pre-requisite like that? No I dont do any pre-defi=\r\nned set of japa?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti r=\r\natio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recitation of a mantra via medita=\r\ntion, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at least it should be dashams=\r\nha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantra in meditation, one is qualifie=\r\nd to give 1 ahuti)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Myself: Doesnt that only apply to purascharaNa =\r\n(based on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody in this group is alread=\r\ny familiar with that book series)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; PrashNa conductor: No it applies=\r\n to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt matter. The rule is =\r\nalways 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it strictly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The=\r\n conversation went onto several other things. Subsequently I went on to get=\r\n mantra-upadesha from a accomplished seer and reciting that mantra and also=\r\n using the same mantra for my ahuti in homam as per the above mentioned rat=\r\nio only and have been very happy with my spiritual progress since. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Whether all the homa-practioners in this group agree with me or not, I ju=\r\nst wanted to point this out to all requesting everybody to perform at least=\r\n 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to get the &quot;qualification&quot; for =\r\nthe ahuti.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Ashutosh\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
