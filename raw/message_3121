This is like asking &quot;I=\r\n am going to so and so bank to withdraw some money. How can I make what I g=\r\net financially optimum?&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Whether you go to a small bank or a big bank=\r\n, you will only get what is available in your account (or credit line). If =\r\nyour account is small, you cannot withdraw one million dollars even if you =\r\ngo to the biggest bank in the world. The focus should be on working hard an=\r\nd saving your earnings.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Tirupati is a nice temple. While in the trip,=\r\n keep chanting &quot;Om Namo Venkateshaaya&quot; or &quot;Om Namo Bhagavate Venkateshaaya&quot;=\r\n within your mind, whatever you are doing externally. If your mind is dwell=\r\ning on a mantra most of the time, it minimizes undesirable thoughts and cre=\r\nates purity of the mind. A pure mind receives and reflects god&#39;s light bett=\r\ner than a mind pre-occupied with a lot of useless thoughts arising from the=\r\n mental conditioning. Keep chanting the mantra.\n&gt;  \n&gt; You can, of course, d=\r\no that even when you are not in Tirupati. Repeated sadhana with a mantra ca=\r\nn create a situation where your mind starts chanting that mantra sub-consci=\r\nously when it is idle. That saves the mind from some useless activity.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; BTW, please do not address me as &quot;Guruji&quot;. People should just call me Nar=\r\nasimha or PVR.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality writings: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWr=\r\nitings\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; D=\r\no Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; -------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- bisw=\r\na108 &lt;biswa1975@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; NAMASKAR NARASIMHA JI\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Guruji=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am going to visit Tirupati Balaji temple near Chennai next wee=\r\nk with my family, please suggest something how to pray perfectly before GOD=\r\n...How could I make my visit spiritually optimum?
