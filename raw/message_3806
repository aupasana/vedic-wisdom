But again Dharma is personal.\nO=\r\nne&#39;s Dharma gets refined by following detachment in actions.\n\n------\nHere i=\r\ns a repost of PVRji on Dharma and Attachment:\n\n\nAs Vimalananda says, dharma=\r\n is indeed personal. Krishna clearly says in\nBhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your ow=\r\nn dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone\nelse&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n\nFollowing the =\r\npath of dharma basically means engaging in the right\naction/duty. Right act=\r\nion varies from person to person, from time to time\nand from place to place=\r\n. It is dependent on what nature expects from you,\nwhich in turn is based o=\r\nn who you have been in the past, what actions you\ndid in the past while ide=\r\nntifying with the action, who you affected in the\npast (and how) with the a=\r\nctions that you identified with, what debts you\ncreated in the process, and=\r\n what mental tendencies you accumulated until\nnow.\n\nIf, based on one&#39;s ment=\r\nal tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person\nto kill evil persons,=\r\n that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental\ntendencies and karmic=\r\n debts, nature wants a person to spread the message of\nuniformity of all re=\r\nligions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s\nmental tendencies an=\r\nd karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the\nritual of homam in the =\r\nworld, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s\nmental tendencies and =\r\nkarmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of\nmoney and construct a =\r\ntemple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n\n* * *\n\nThe dharma of a being may change=\r\n from one life to another.\n\nAt the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s=\r\n dharma to kill his gurus,\nelders and relatives. The time then was such tha=\r\nt there was too much weight\non earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved=\r\n of some weight. Tremendous\ndestruction was to take place and civilization =\r\ndestroyed to a great extent,\nto welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. =\r\nArjuna being a great warrior,\nit was his dharma to facilitate that. Some pe=\r\nople he deeply loved and\nrespected were on the other side and it was his dh=\r\narma to kill them.\n\nWhen the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century=\r\n as one of\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arju=\r\nna in a\nprevious life, according to Ramakrishna), his dharma was different =\r\nin this\nnew time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite h=\r\nis\naristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire\ng=\r\nenerations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to\noth=\r\ners. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna\nsaid),=\r\n his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n\n* * *\n\nThe =\r\ntricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n\nSome people =\r\nhave interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dharma\nand not som=\r\neone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the concept\nof caste (v=\r\narna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of\ncaste mobi=\r\nlity was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by\nkilling birds. =\r\nHe became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a\nkshatrita and =\r\na powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi\nlater. Basically v=\r\narna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna\nof father, because=\r\n that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one\ndevelops in life, one =\r\ngets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n\nThus, the misinterpretation o=\r\nf Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your\ndharma from your caste is wr=\r\nong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in\nthe world. Each person has i=\r\nndividual dharma.\n\nKnowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult=\r\n. If one is pure\nenough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us h=\r\nave a part of our\nmind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surround=\r\ned by a lot of\nnoise from other parts of our minds which tell other things.=\r\n Thus, we get\nconfused.\n\nWe should make the best judgment combining discrim=\r\nination and intuition and\ndecide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely=\r\n. We may be err, but doing\nthe best we can is all that we can do!\n\nMore tha=\r\nn following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in\nactions wi=\r\nthout identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not\naccumulating new=\r\n karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build\ntoo much attachm=\r\nent to what we are doing. We should engage in the best\npossible actions (ba=\r\nsed on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given\nsituation is), wit=\r\nh as little attachment and self-identification with the\naction as possible.=\r\n When the action is finished, we should leave the result\nto god. We should =\r\nnot think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it\nwork&quot; etc. Such adhe=\r\nrence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through\nuntached action) will simp=\r\nlify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly.\nAs we become purer, our m=\r\nind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer.\nThere is a positive feed=\r\nback here. This will slowly enable us to see our\ndharma clearly and follow =\r\nit without incurring new karmas. This is not easy,\nbut not as difficult as =\r\npeople think.\n\nThe bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma=\r\n, one&#39;s sense of\n&quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages =\r\nin action with\nlittle attachment.\n\n* * *\n\nIn deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s i=\r\nntellect and intuition are the inputs.\nAnother external input is the words =\r\nof scriptures and learned men. One can\nderive one&#39;s dharma from them. A spe=\r\ncial place is given to one&#39;s spiritual\nmaster. If one surrenders to a spiri=\r\ntual master, one can take the words of\nthe master to determine one&#39;s dharma=\r\n and follow it sincerely.\n\nWhen Arjuna was confused about what his dharma w=\r\nas and thought killing gurus\nand relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in=\r\n Krishna who clarified his\ndharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) wa=\r\ns confused about his dharma\nand wanted to renounce the world and go to a se=\r\ncluded place to do sadhana,\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upo=\r\nn him to stay in the material\nworld and do the work of Mother for him.\n\nOne=\r\n who is not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s\nde=\r\nbts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what\non=\r\ne&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into\n=\r\none&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n\n* * *\n\nBottomline=\r\n is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and\ndeclare that=\r\n as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from\ntime to time=\r\n and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find\nout what on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s\ndharma by i=\r\nncreasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual\nsadhana (lik=\r\ne homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much\nattachment, one ca=\r\nn slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of\none&#39;s individual =\r\ndharma.\n\n\n\n-------\n\n&quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to =\r\npersist so long as\none does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n\n\nOn=\r\n Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I agree with Dinesh.

VS\n&gt;&gt; gives many excuses and many dates but fails and ultimately does no=\r\nt pay\n&gt;&gt; back. Mr. FL is under great pressure due to that.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mr. FL=\r\n can have many options to react in the situations:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 1] Thinking co=\r\nnstantly and repenting for the act He can-\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Curse, Constantly follow-up=\r\n, Mount Abuses, Remain under stress, resort\n&gt;&gt; to other techniques of &#39;Vasu=\r\nli&#39; and resorts to many Internal and external\n&gt;&gt; activities concerning that=\r\n issue.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In this case, He strongly identifies with the Money, act =\r\nof Giving then\n&gt;&gt; expecting it back, Repenting etc...\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; OR\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; 2] Mr. FL can really grab the golden chance to resort to the\n&gt;&gt; implement=\r\nation of knowledge (KIP-Knowledge in Practice) and thinks that it\n&gt;&gt; was a =\r\nRina which needed to be paid back and practically starts training the\n&gt;&gt; mi=\r\nnd with that knowledge. He follows up for the money but with the attitude\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; of detachment. Although he shows to his family and friends that he is\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nextremely concerned and it was foolish act etc... But in his mind he thinks=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; that it was a rina from some past life which was fulfilled. He thinks t=\r\nhat\n&gt;&gt; they were Money of Mother and she will take care. If they needed to =\r\ncome\n&gt;&gt; back, she will do it or if they were to be paid to nullify some pas=\r\nt rinas\n&gt;&gt; then they will not come back.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; With the Second Approach=\r\n, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas and\n&gt;&gt; will be able to break fr=\r\nee from this particular chain.

One\n&gt;&gt; aspect of the Mother makes you fight =\r\nand overcome it. When one realizes Self\n&gt;&gt; at the end, irrespective of the =\r\npath taken, one finally sees that all these\n&gt;&gt; are aspects of a Single Moth=\r\ner who is also essentially true Self.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I ha=\r\nve started to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Svobodha.=\r\n For now I have very mixed feelings on the subject.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I need=\r\n to read more!\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Aghora series books by Svoboda are good, b=\r\nut Aghora is not everyone&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed feeli=\r\nngs.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. O=\r\nne of the names of\n&gt;&gt; Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C2 Aghora (aghori) does =\r\nnot see anything as\n&gt;&gt; terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanen=\r\nt manifestations of god\n&gt;&gt; and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on w=\r\nhat is permanent (god)\n&gt;&gt; always, instead of impermanent manifestations of =\r\ngod.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; When someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam s=\r\natya hai&quot; while\n&gt;&gt; carrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only th=\r\ne name of Lord Rama\n&gt;&gt; is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The ide=\r\na is to remind oneself\n&gt;&gt; that life and death are just a temporary illusion=\r\n and only the Lord is real.\n&gt;&gt; But the question is: why should we remind ou=\r\nrselves of this ultimate truth\n&gt;&gt; only when someone dies? When someone prai=\r\nses us for a supposedly great thing\n&gt;&gt; we have done and we are about to fee=\r\nl proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell\n&gt;&gt; ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This t=\r\nhing we did and the praises are\n&gt;&gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is re=\r\nal. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt;&gt; temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attract=\r\ned to something beautiful and want\n&gt;&gt; to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;R=\r\naama naam satya hai. This thing that\n&gt;&gt; seems beautiful and other things th=\r\nat seem not so beautiful are temporary\n&gt;&gt; illusions. Only the Lord is real.=\r\n Let the mind not dwell on temporary\n&gt;&gt; illusions&quot;?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; When someone att=\r\nacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or\n&gt;&gt; angry, can&#39;t we tell =\r\nourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai.

Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt;&gt; temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always.=\r\n His mind\n&gt;&gt; rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *=\r\ndwelling* on\n&gt;&gt; them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad e=\r\ntc and thinking\n&gt;&gt; about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find =\r\nand focus on what is\n&gt;&gt; permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusi=\r\non&quot;. An\n&gt;&gt; aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both imper=\r\nmenant\n&gt;&gt; illusions and the only permanent reality within them is the Self,=\r\n he\n&gt;&gt; questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual=\r\n where\n&gt;&gt; feces is eaten.=C2 But, please remember that eating feces is not =\r\nthe main\n&gt;&gt; point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perce=\r\niving an\n&gt;&gt; impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the ma=\r\nin point. For\n&gt;&gt; example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for =\r\nsuch a person&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Sel=\r\nf (&quot;feces&quot;) while\n&gt;&gt; eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, bu=\r\nt the mind will not be\n&gt;&gt; dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; wi=\r\nth certain properties and\n&gt;&gt; will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be =\r\nthinking that he is Self and\n&gt;&gt; he is eating Self.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Of cou=\r\nrse, a vedantin also has the same notions really. He chants\n&gt;&gt; vedic verses=\r\n when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am\n&gt;&gt; consuming =\r\nSelf&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not\n&gt;&gt; be ful=\r\nly absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the\n&gt;&gt; imp=\r\nermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the\n&gt;&gt; =\r\npermanent (Self).\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are tell=\r\ning themselves the same truth\n&gt;&gt; and trying to absorb that truth into every=\r\n thought and impulse. But aghora\n&gt;&gt; is putting himself in an extreme situat=\r\nion where failure results in a very\n&gt;&gt; bad dual experience. That can in fac=\r\nt work as an incentive in forcing one to\n&gt;&gt; transcend duality! In the case =\r\nof a person who chants a Vedic verse that\n&gt;&gt; says &quot;I am Self and I am consu=\r\nming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and nicely\n&gt;&gt; made food, the fallout from =\r\nfailing to absorb the mind in Self while eating\n&gt;&gt; is not too bad. If the m=\r\nind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste\n&gt;&gt; of a laddu or other f=\r\nood, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the\n&gt;&gt; mind fails to absor=\r\nb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so\n&gt;&gt; disgusting. Th=\r\nus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual\n&gt;&gt; experience may act =\r\nas an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; However, difficult=\r\n tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by\n&gt;&gt; everyone merely because of =\r\nan incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas\n&gt;&gt; succeeds.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someone is doing a l=\r\not of\n&gt;&gt; sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. =\r\nSuppose\n&gt;&gt; one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the =\r\nmiddle of\n&gt;&gt; sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep th=\r\ne mind away\n&gt;&gt; from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcomi=\r\nng such\n&gt;&gt; thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract o=\r\nne. Even if\n&gt;&gt; one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that =\r\nthe fascination\n&gt;&gt; in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But,=\r\n how to overcome the\n&gt;&gt; fascination some minds may have for sex?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana an=\r\nd\n&gt;&gt; sex as two different activities (one pure and the other impure), he ma=\r\ny\n&gt;&gt; combine them into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Sup=\r\npose\n&gt;&gt; an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and =\r\nthen does\n&gt;&gt; his japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in =\r\nsex. He may\n&gt;&gt; think that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he=\r\n persists to do\n&gt;&gt; japam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mi=\r\nnd may be\n&gt;&gt; reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something=\r\n impure. He\n&gt;&gt; may no longer feel titillation. The association in his mind =\r\nbetween\n&gt;&gt; nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures phys=\r\nically or\n&gt;&gt; mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke though=\r\nts of\n&gt;&gt; meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise i=\r\nn the head\n&gt;&gt; may not lead to denser and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; denser thoughts relating to=\r\n sex and distraction in sadhana, but they\n&gt;&gt; may now take the mind back to =\r\nmeditation. After spending so much time in\n&gt;&gt; meditation while sitting nake=\r\nd intimately, the attraction and thrill mind\n&gt;&gt; may feel for nakedness or i=\r\nntimacy may be broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; fascination and weakne=\r\nss for sex may be gone largely.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of conditi=\r\noning based on prior experiences and the\n&gt;&gt; thoughts we are exposed to. Agh=\r\nora sometimes tries to break down some of\n&gt;&gt; these structures by engaging i=\r\nn certain practices that undermine those\n&gt;&gt; structures.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; H=\r\nowever, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible\n&gt;&gt; tha=\r\nt the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready=\r\n to\n&gt;&gt; start with.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 Bottomline is that an aghora take=\r\ns problems and weaknesses head on\n&gt;&gt; and sets up a high stakes fight with t=\r\nhem, whereas a normal person may push\n&gt;&gt; the problems under the carpet and =\r\nfight slowly and with low stakes. Such a\n&gt;&gt; risky strategy is not applicabl=\r\ne to all.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what=\r\n is Vedanta and what is\n&gt;&gt; Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to und=\r\nerstand and absorb Vedanta\n&gt;&gt; in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a hig=\r\nh stakes war plan.

Also, in my case, I do sandh=\r\nyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20\n&gt;&gt; minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 time=\r\ns(10 minutes), a short rudra\n&gt;&gt; Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana=\r\n etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to\n&gt;&gt; about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual.

It is dangerous t=\r\no follow someone&lt;br&gt;else&#39;s dharma&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFollowing the path of=\r\n dharma basically means engaging in the right&lt;br&gt;action/duty. Right action =\r\nvaries from person to person, from time to time&lt;br&gt;and from place to place.=\r\n It is dependent on what nature expects from you,&lt;br&gt;\n\nwhich in turn is bas=\r\ned on who you have been in the past, what actions you&lt;br&gt;did in the past wh=\r\nile identifying with the action, who you affected in the&lt;br&gt;past (and how) =\r\nwith the actions that you identified with, what debts you&lt;br&gt;\n\ncreated in t=\r\nhe process, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until&lt;br&gt;now.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;If, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a =\r\nperson&lt;br&gt;to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on=\r\n one&#39;s mental&lt;br&gt;\n\ntendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person t=\r\no spread the message of&lt;br&gt;uniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#3=\r\n9;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s&lt;br&gt;mental tendencies and karmic debts, n=\r\nature wants a person to spread the&lt;br&gt;\n\nritual of homam in the world, that =\r\nbecomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s&lt;br&gt;mental tendencies and k=\r\narmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of&lt;br&gt;money and construct =\r\na temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The dharma o=\r\nf a being may change from one life to another.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At the time of Mahabh=\r\narata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus,&lt;br&gt;elders and rela=\r\ntives. The time then was such that there was too much weight&lt;br&gt;\n\non earth =\r\nand nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous&lt;br&gt;destru=\r\nction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great extent,&lt;br&gt;to=\r\n welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great warrior,&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\nit was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kill them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of&lt;br&gt;Ram=\r\nakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\nprevious life, according to Ramakrishna), his dharma was different in th=\r\nis&lt;br&gt;new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his=\r\n&lt;br&gt;aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\ngenerations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service =\r\nto&lt;br&gt;others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrish=\r\nna&lt;br&gt;said), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The tricky question is: How does one decide what is o=\r\nne&#39;s dharma?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words sa=\r\nying &quot;follow your own dharma&lt;br&gt;and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot=\r\n; in the light of castism. Though the concept&lt;br&gt;\n\nof caste (varna) has bee=\r\nn there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of&lt;br&gt;caste mobility was v=\r\nery much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by&lt;br&gt;killing birds. He beca=\r\nme a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a&lt;br&gt;\n\nkshatrita and a =\r\npowerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi&lt;br&gt;later. Basically =\r\nvarna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna&lt;br&gt;of father,=\r\n because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one&lt;br&gt;\n\ndevelops =\r\nin life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thus, =\r\nthe misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas i=\r\nn&lt;br&gt;\n\nthe world. Each person has individual dharma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Knowing what on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure&lt;br&gt;enough, on=\r\ne will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our&lt;br&gt;mi=\r\nnd that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\nnoise from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;confused.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We should make the best judgment combining discriminatio=\r\nn and intuition and&lt;br&gt;decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. W=\r\ne may be err, but doing&lt;br&gt;\n\nthe best we can is all that we can do!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nMore than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in&lt;br=\r\n&gt;actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not&lt;br&gt;ac=\r\ncumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\ntoo much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the gi=\r\nven&lt;br&gt;situation is), with as little attachment and self-identification wit=\r\nh the&lt;br&gt;\n\naction as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave=\r\n the result&lt;br&gt;to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what=\r\n will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it&lt;br&gt;work&quot; etc. Such adherence of =\r\nnishkama karma yoga (unfication through&lt;br&gt;\n\nuntached action) will simplify=\r\n our ego and purify our consciousness slowly.&lt;br&gt;As we become purer, our mi=\r\nnd will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer.&lt;br&gt;There is a positive fe=\r\nedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our&lt;br&gt;\n\ndharma clearly and =\r\nfollow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy,&lt;br&gt;but not as dif=\r\nficult as people think.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The bottomline is: Even if one is not follow=\r\ning one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of&lt;br&gt;&quot;this is my dharma&quot; g=\r\nets refined with time if one engages in action with&lt;br&gt;\n\nlittle attachment.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and =\r\nintuition are the inputs.&lt;br&gt;Another external input is the words of scriptu=\r\nres and learned men. One can&lt;br&gt;derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A specia=\r\nl place is given to one&#39;s spiritual&lt;br&gt;\n\nmaster. If one surrenders to a=\r\n spiritual master, one can take the words of&lt;br&gt;the master to determine one=\r\n&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When Arjuna was confused abou=\r\nt what his dharma was and thought killing gurus&lt;br&gt;\n\nand relatives was not =\r\ndharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his&lt;br&gt;dharma. When Narendra=\r\nnath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma&lt;br&gt;and wanted to ren=\r\nounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana,&lt;br&gt;\n\nRamakrishna =\r\nParamahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material&lt;br&gt;world a=\r\nnd do the work of Mother for him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One who is not in tune with nature=\r\n and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s&lt;br&gt;debts are and what nature =\r\nexpects from one can err in the judgment of what&lt;br&gt;\n\none&#39;s dharma is. =\r\nIf one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into&lt;br&gt;one&#39;=\r\ns inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bo=\r\nttomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n\ndeclare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from=\r\n&lt;br&gt;time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to =\r\nfind&lt;br&gt;out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s underst=\r\nanding of one&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n\ndharma by increasing internal purity. By doing var=\r\nious kinds of spiritual&lt;br&gt;sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in =\r\nactions without much&lt;br&gt;attachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refin=\r\ne one&#39;s understanding of&lt;br&gt;\n\none&#39;s individual dharma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-------&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to persist =\r\nso long as one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi Ba=\r\nnerjee &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:banerjeea@...&quot;&gt;banerje=\r\nea@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color:#fff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n =\r\n &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;I agree with Dinesh. Only very ad=\r\nvanced sadhakas will be able to identify rnas / karmic debts=A0and know how=\r\n/where/why they are to be paid off. The rest of us have to follow dharma, w=\r\nhich includes standing up for what is right and righteous and not being def=\r\neatist or fatalistic.

Now it happened so that Mr. VS could not repay =\r\nit due to reasons only known to him. Mr. VS gives many excuses and many dat=\r\nes but fails and ultimately does not pay back. Mr. FL is under great pressu=\r\nre due to that.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Mr. FL can have many options to react i=\r\nn the situations:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 1] Thinking constantly and repenting for=\r\n the act He can-&lt;br&gt;&gt; Curse, Constantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain =\r\nunder stress, resort to other techniques of &#39;Vasuli&#39; and resorts to=\r\n many Internal and external activities concerning that issue.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; In this case, He strongly identifies with the Money, act of Giving t=\r\nhen expecting it back, Repenting etc...&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; OR&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; 2] Mr. FL can really grab the golden chance to resort to the implementati=\r\non of knowledge (KIP-Knowledge in Practice) and thinks that it was a Rina w=\r\nhich needed to be paid back and practically starts training the mind with t=\r\nhat knowledge. He follows up for the money but with the attitude of detachm=\r\nent. Although he shows to his family and friends that he is extremely conce=\r\nrned and it was foolish act etc... But in his mind he thinks that it was a =\r\nrina from some past life which was fulfilled. He thinks that they were Mone=\r\ny of Mother and she will take care. If they needed to come back, she will d=\r\no it or if they were to be paid to nullify some past rinas then they will n=\r\not come back.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; With the Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL=\r\n will not Create New Rinas and will be able to break free from this particu=\r\nlar chain. He may have successfully PAID BACK his debt.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Wi=\r\nth the first Approach, Mr. FL has identified himself very strongly with Mon=\r\ney and its ownership and hence all the actions done due to that, so He may =\r\nhave created NEW RINAS which will be needed to settled on a later date.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; However I am not sure for what I have written.

If your partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do not be dishea=\r\nrtened by failure initially. As time goes on, the=C2=A0thing in your mind w=\r\nhich thinks of sex is incinerated and slowly you find that a naked female(o=\r\nr male as=C2=A0may be the case)=C2=A0body is like a landscape picture just =\r\nlike any other picture made by Her of nature(like Niagara falls, or Angkor =\r\nWat, you need not be disturbed by it, you can certainly=C2=A0feel that the =\r\npicture=C2=A0is very beautiful=C2=A0but you need not be aroused by it).
