The path\nused for the temple proces=\r\nsions passed nearby.\n\nHere Ramana was fully exposed to the weather. Sometim=\r\nes a cold wind blew and\nhis body would be covered with dew. To protect hims=\r\nelf against the cold he\nwould cross his arms about the upper part of his na=\r\nked body. Later he\nreflected that no woollen blanket could compare to the a=\r\nrms laid across the\nchest and that this was the first upper garment that he=\r\n used.\n\nAt the following Kartikai festival Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s first disci=\r\nple, Uddandi\nNayinar, arrived and became a permanent companion.He took care=\r\n of his bodily\nneeds and prevented him from being disturbed or bothered. He=\r\n settled down at\na short distance from him,observed the crowds of visitors =\r\nfor hours at a\ntime and drove away the urchins who found it amusing to caus=\r\ne trouble for\nthe young ascetic. He also cooked simple meals, which he shar=\r\ned with him.\n\nIt was because of Uddandi Nayinar that Annamalai Tambiran fir=\r\nst noticed\nRamana.\n\nOne day, as he was walking past the Illupai tree he saw=\r\n the young Swami\nsitting there and was deeply impressed, from that day on h=\r\ne accompanied\nUddandi Nayinar.\n\nFinally they both suggested to Sri Ramana t=\r\nhat he should move to Gurumurtam.\nThere he could meditate undisturbed as th=\r\ne place was secluded and in\naddition offered better protection from the col=\r\nd. Ramana agreed and in\nFebruary 1897,not quite six months after his arriva=\r\nl at Tiruvannamalai, he\nleft the temple area and was brought to Gurumurtam =\r\nby Tambiran and Uddandi.\n\nAt times Tambiran, due to his devout but excessiv=\r\ne veneration,became a\nnuisance to Sri Ramana. One day he made preparations =\r\nto render homage to his\nnew guru like to one of the idols of the goddesses =\r\nin the temple\n(abhishekam). He obtained flowers, oil,sandal paste, milk and=\r\n other\ningredients and actually wanted to pour this over the head of his =\r\n=E2=80=9Cliving\ngod=E2=80=9D. To prevent this, Ramana took a piece of charc=\r\noal and the next day,\nbefore Tambiran arrived, wrote on the wall in Tamil, =\r\n=E2=80=9CThis [food] alone is\nthe service [needed] for this [body].=E2=80=\r\n=9D\n\nSo Tambiran was forced to abandon his plan. Through this incident peop=\r\nle\nlearned that the silent Swami was educated and able to read and write.\n\n=\r\nAmongst the admirers who had started to visit Ramana regularly,was a\nhighly=\r\n-placed official called Venkataramana Iyer. When he realized that the\nSwami=\r\n was able to write, he felt he must find out his name and where he came\nfro=\r\nm. But Ramana, despite repeated questioning, remained silent. Iyer\nfinally =\r\nexplained that he would not leave until his questions were answered,\neven i=\r\nf that meant that he would have to go hungry and get into trouble\nbecause o=\r\nf his lengthy absence from his office. This moved the young Swami\nand he wr=\r\note down the words, =E2=80=9CVenkataraman, Tiruchuli=E2=80=9D. The place,\nh=\r\nowever, was unknown to the official. So Ramana reached for the\nPeriyapurana=\r\nm, which was lying at his side, and pointed out Tiruchuli as the\nname of a =\r\nvillage, whose temple was honoured in the famous hymn by\nSundaramurti (one =\r\nof the 63 Tamil saints). Thus,not only the official but\nTambiram and all th=\r\nose present discovered his name and his origins. From now\non Ramana was no =\r\nlonger nameless and unknown.\n\nRamana was absorbed in deep samadhi most of t=\r\nhe time unaware of his body,\nwhich he neglected, completely disregarding hi=\r\ns outward appearance. He was\nfilthy, his hair had grown very long and had b=\r\necome a dishevelled and matted\nmass and his fingernails had grown so long a=\r\nnd crooked, that he was unable\nto use his hands for any useful purpose. Nei=\r\nther Tambiran nor Uddandi did\nanything about this and he himself felt no ne=\r\ned to change his bodily\ncondition. Only later, when Palaniswami took care o=\r\nf him, did the daily bath\nbecome a routine.\n\nOnce, however, he was forced t=\r\no bathe and on another occasion to have a\nshave, =E2=80=9CEven so, a lady, =\r\nby name Minakshi, who used now and then to bring\nfood to give me, one day b=\r\nrought a large pot and began to boil water. I\nthought it was for some use f=\r\nor herself,but, taking from a basket some oil,\nsoap-nut, etc., she said,=E2=\r\n=80=98Swami, please come=E2=80=99. I did not move. But would she\nkeep quiet=\r\n! She pulled me by the arm, made me sit, smeared the oil all over\nmy body a=\r\nnd bathed me. The hair on the head which had got matted for want of\ncare, w=\r\nas now spread out and hung down like the mane of a lion. =E2=80=A6 Shaving\n=\r\nwas also like that. The shave I had on the day I came here has been\nrecorde=\r\nd; the second was after a year and a half. The hair had got matted\nand wove=\r\nn like a basket. Small stones and dust had settled down in it and\nthe head =\r\nused to feel heavy. I had also long nails, and a frightful\nappearance. So p=\r\neople pressed me to have a shave, and I yielded. When my\nhead was shaven cl=\r\nean, I began to wonder whether I had a head or not, it\nfelt so light. I sho=\r\nok my head this way and that to assure myself that it\nwas there. That showe=\r\nd the amount of burden I had been carrying on my head.=E2=80=9D\n\nThe place =\r\nwhere Ramana sat was infested with ants, but he took no notice of\nthem as t=\r\nhey crawled over his body and bit him incessantly.After a while his\ndevotee=\r\ns sat him on a stool against the wall. To keep the ants away they\nplaced th=\r\ne legs of the stool in jugs of water, but to no avail, as the ants\nmerely r=\r\nan up the wall and bit his back. To this day the imprint of his back\ncan be=\r\n seen where he sat leaning against the wall.\n\nDuring the first two months s=\r\npent in Gurumurtam, Tambiram used to give him\nsome of the food which had be=\r\nen offered at the Gurumurtam shrine. But then\nTambiran went away, after fir=\r\nst asking Uddandi to look after the Swami. He\npromised to be back in a\nweek=\r\n but, in fact, only returned a year later. Some weeks after he left,\nUddand=\r\ni also had to return to his own math. So suddenly no one was there to\ncare =\r\nfor Ramana. But, as a result of his increasing fame, food was always\nbrough=\r\nt to him. After the departures of both Tambiran and Uddandi the only\nproble=\r\nm was that there was no-one there to keep the crowds away. This\nproblem was=\r\n finally solved when Palaniswami joined him.\n\nPalaniswami was a Malayali fr=\r\nom Kerala and at least 20 years older than Sri\nRamana. He paid homage to th=\r\ne idol of Goddess Ganesha in a temple in the\ntown. His only food was food w=\r\nhich had been offered to Ganesha, which\nconsisted of a single meal a day, t=\r\no which he added no spices, not even\nsalt. Someone noticed his devotion to =\r\nthe Goddess and said, =E2=80=9CWhat is the use\nof spending your lifetime wi=\r\nth this stone Swami? There is a young Swami in\nflesh and blood at Gurumurta=\r\nm. He is steeped in austerities (tapas) like the\nyouthful Dhruva mentioned =\r\nin the puranas. If you go and serve him, and\nadhere to him, your life would=\r\n serve its purpose.=E2=80=9D Others also drew his\nattention to the fact tha=\r\nt the Swami was without an attendant at the time\nand that it would be a ble=\r\nssing to serve such a great soul. Spurred on in\nthis way Palaniswami went t=\r\no Gurumurtam.\n\nSome time in May 1898, after a little over one year spent at=\r\n\nGurumurtam,Ramana and Palaniswami moved to the adjoining mango grove. Here=\r\n\nthey spent several peaceful months undisturbed by the numerous visitors, a=\r\ns\nVenkataraman Naicker, the owner of the garden, let no-one enter who had n=\r\not\nbeen asked in. There they lived in two narrow sheds under a mango tree. =\r\nRamana\nremembers,=E2=80=9CUnder a mango tree they erected something overhea=\r\nd to prevent\nrain from falling on me. There was, however, not enough space =\r\nunder it even\nto stretch my legs fully while sleeping. So I used to sit alm=\r\nost all the\ntime like a bird in its nest. Opposite my shelter Palaniswami a=\r\nlso had a\nsmall shed. In the huge garden, only two of us used to stay.\n\nPal=\r\naniswami, who had access to a library in town, brought back a number of\nboo=\r\nks in Tamil on Vedanta, such as Kaivalya Navaneeta,Yoga Vasistha and\nShanka=\r\nras Vivekachudamani.But, as his knowledge of Tamil was not very good,\nhe us=\r\ned to struggle through the scriptures word by word and often had\ndifficulti=\r\nes in understanding.Ramana read each of the books, immediately\ngrasped the =\r\nmeaning,remembered everything and imparted the essence of it to\nPalaniswami=\r\n. In this way Ramana gradually learned about all the important\nVedanta scri=\r\nptures and discovered that his personal experience corresponded\nwith them. =\r\nThe experience he had had on the upper floor of his uncle=E2=80=99s house\ni=\r\nn Madurai was exactly the same as the experiences he found described in the=\r\n\nscriptures.\n\nSource: Ramana Maharshi: His Life A biography by Gabriele Ebe=\r\nrt\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=\r\n=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636b2ad45eeec85047f3a4222\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\nRamana when living in Subrahmanya temple after he shifted from Patala Linga=\r\nm.After spending some weeks at this shrine Ramana moved to the adjoining fl=\r\nower garden.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Finally, Ramana moved to the hall where the vehicles =\r\nfor the temple processions were kept (vahana mantapam).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;After some time Ramana left the vahana mantapam and s=\r\nat under the Illupai tree which was inside the outer wall of the southern t=\r\nemple tower.

Opposite my shelter Pal=\r\naniswami also had a small shed. In the huge garden, only two of us used to =\r\nstay.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Palaniswami, who had=\r\n access to a library in town, brought back a number of books in Tamil on Ve=\r\ndanta, such as Kaivalya Navaneeta,Yoga Vasistha and Shankaras Vivekachudama=\r\nni.&lt;/span&gt;But, as his knowledge of Tamil was not very good, he used to stru=\r\nggle through the scriptures word by word and often had difficulties in unde=\r\nrstanding.Ramana read each of the books, immediately grasped the meaning,re=\r\nmembered everything and imparted the essence of it to Palaniswami. In this =\r\nway Ramana gradually learned about all the important Vedanta scriptures and=\r\n discovered that his personal experience corresponded with them. The experi=\r\nence he had had on the upper floor of his uncle=E2=80=99s house in Madurai =\r\nwas exactly the same as the experiences he found described in the scripture=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: Ramana Maharshi=\r\n: His Life A biography by Gabriele Ebert&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=\r\n=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=\r\n=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--001636b2ad45eeec85047f3a4222--\r\n\n"}}
