There are other technicalities that can be\ndone away with, when the=\r\ny start to block one.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I recently saw the ch=\r\nart of a person, who I am sure will make much\nprogress and be in a position=\r\n to guide thousands of people\nspiritually. His chart strongly suggested tha=\r\nt he should chant\nChandipath or do Chandi homam and then progress will come=\r\n. I told him\nthat. He said he learnt Chandipath sometime ago but he does no=\r\nt read\nit regularly because he does not have the anga nyasam and kara nyasa=\r\nm\ntext. He cannot read Indian scripts and can only read English.\nChandipath=\r\n is available in Roman script from Ramakrishna math, but\nthat only has the =\r\nthirteen chapters, kavacham, argala and keelakam. It\ndoes not give the nyas=\r\nas, which are given in the Gita press version\n(available only in Indian lan=\r\nguages). The poor guy assumed he could\nnot do it without proper nyasas and =\r\ndid not attempt to do it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I told him that 13 chapters are the main th=\r\ning and all else is\nsecondary. I told him to just start with 13 chapters.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Like this, many people have various ideas ab=\r\nout &quot;the right way&quot; to\ndo it and do not even try things lest they should it=\r\n do it &quot;a wrong way&quot;!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, there *are* right ways to do poojas,=\r\n japas and homas.\nHowever, there are also right ways to do so many things. =\r\nLet me give\nan analogy using eating.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; There =\r\nare right ways to eat too. There are certain mantras you\nshould say before =\r\neating, while eating and after eating. There are\nrules for what items shoul=\r\nd be eaten. There are  rules for what order\nthey should be served in, on th=\r\ne plate. There are rules for how the\nserved items are arranged on the plate=\r\n. There are rules for what order\nyou eat them in. There are rules for what =\r\nkind of plate can be used\n(silver, gloden, copper, banana leaf etc). There =\r\nare rules for what\nkind of clothese the person serving food can wear. There=\r\n are rules for\nwhat kind of clothes eater can wear. There are many many rul=\r\nes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Suppose you don&#39;t know some rules. Or suppose you are unable to\nf=\r\nollow some rules and have to compromise. Or suppose you don&#39;t know\nthe mant=\r\nras to be recited before and after eating. Will you then stop\neating? Won&#39;t=\r\n it be foolish to not eat because you cannot follow all\nthe rules and techn=\r\nicalities of eating? Won&#39;t you compromise wherever\nyou have to and just eat=\r\n *some* food, so that you get some strength\nand sustain yourself?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Fri=\r\nends, the *same* thing applies to spiritual sadhana. Whether you\nspend 5 ho=\r\nurs or 1 hour or half hour or ten minutes everyday on\nspiritual sadhana, it=\r\n should be an integral part of your life. It\nshould be as important as eati=\r\nng food, drinking water and breathing\nair. In fact, it really is. Just as n=\r\not eating makes you weak, not\ndoing any sadhana also makes you weak. Just a=\r\ns eating makes you\nstronger, doing some sadhana also makes you stronger.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; People are unnecessarily afraid of spiritual sadhana. They take all\nthe=\r\n rules and technicalities too seriously (unlike with other things\nin life, =\r\nsuch as eating, drinking, bathing etc) and block themselves\nfrom progressin=\r\ng.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This needs to change. People need to know that it is ok to\ncomprom=\r\nise on most things, but important to do *some* sadhana. Just as\nyou would e=\r\nat simple dal chaval (lentil soup with rice) or a bread and\ncheese sandwich=\r\n when there is no multi-course meal that satisfies the\nrules, you can just =\r\nsit down for 15 minutes without moving and repeat\nany mantra. Or just light=\r\n a fire in a silver or copper or clay bowl\nwith sticks, say &quot;Om bhuh swaha,=\r\n Om bhuvah swaha, Om suvah swaha, Om\nbhurbhuvassuvah swaha&quot; and then repeat=\r\n some mantra with swaha added\nand some ghee drops poured into fire. Such a =\r\nsimple sadhana also, when\nrepeated daily, can be powerful. It is definitely=\r\n better than avoiding\nsadhana at all, just as eating just a bread sandwich =\r\nis better than\nnot eating at all.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Rules and=\r\n technicalities are there to maximize the experience one\ngets from sadhana.=\r\n They are NOT there to block or stop one from doing\nsadhana altogether. Tha=\r\nt would be counter productive.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Each rule, each technicality and each =\r\nstep in the standard\nprocedures has some deeper meaning and motive (which i=\r\ns lost on people\nthese days!), but it is ok to compromise. If you can, foll=\r\now *all* the\nrules. If you cannot, atleast do *something* with several rule=\r\ns\ncompromised, rather than not doing anything at all.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Too many people=\r\n are suffering from intertia when it comes to\nprogressing spiritually. I se=\r\ne some great souls meant for big things\nalso suffering from inertia at vari=\r\nous levels. Unnecessary fear of\nrules and technicalities is part of the rea=\r\nson for this inertia.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This needs to be changed. Spiritually inclined =\r\npeople have to be\nempowered and boldened. The fear and inertia in them need=\r\n to be\ndestroyed. This is very much needed for not just for the individual\n=\r\ngood of those people, but the collective good of world in these\ninteresting=\r\n times.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free =\r\nJyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer\n\n\nDear Sir,\nThis art=\r\nicle has given me a lot of hope.\nSir I learned trancendental meditation  wh=\r\nen i was in 8th class.I\npractised it for some time.During college years i r=\r\nead the Mahabharat\nand many other religious texts.I always did daily puja w=\r\nith a lot of\nbhakti.\nThree years ago, i met Vashisthji in Gondia--He is a r=\r\netired officer\nof the irrigation department--He thaught me the basics .\nof =\r\nastrology.He also guided me to do jaap.During navrati i did jaap of\ndevi&#39;s =\r\nnavarn mantra.Then during saawan month i did jaap of shiva&#39;s\npanchakshari m=\r\nantra.Last chaitra navratri i did gayatri jaap and again\nthis shravan i did=\r\n Shiva&#39;s jaap.\n But all this was done without any nyas or any of the other =\r\nthings\nthat you have mentioned.I always wondered whether what i was doing w=\r\nas\nright, but still went ahead thinking that taking Gods name cannot be\nwro=\r\nng.Also all these jaap were done without asking for anything in\nreturn.Am i=\r\n right ?I dont know sanskrit so though i have so many books\ni am unable to =\r\nlearn from them.\n  Also from sometime i have been thinking that it might be=\r\n better if i\nstuck to one mantra rather than doing so many different ones.I=\r\n would\nbe greatfull to you.Please help me.\nMy dob is 28 nov. 1967;pob is mu=\r\nmbai;and tob is 8.20am.\nsorry about the lenth of this mail,but quite frankl=\r\ny i could go on and on.\nThank you and waiting for your reply.\n             =\r\n                Sunita.\n\n\n"}}
