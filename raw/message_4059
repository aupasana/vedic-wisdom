When you see that\nthe mind invents everything, all will vanish.=\r\n The good will vanish, the evil\nwill vanish, and you will remain as you are=\r\n.&quot;\n\nDr. Syed was a Muslim scholar and a great devotee of Bhagavan. His wife=\r\n too\nbecame a devotee without losing her faith in the ways and conventions =\r\nof the\nMuslim religion. She would not appear before other men. Stealthily s=\r\nhe would\ncome to the Ashram, hide herself in one of the rooms and implore h=\r\ner husband\nto ask Bhagavan to come to see her. It was a most unusual reques=\r\nt, but such\nwas Bhagavan&#39;s grace and compassion that even this was granted.=\r\n Mrs. Syed\nwould at first keep silent, rather than talk to Bhagavan through=\r\n her veil;\nthen later she would talk to him without a veil. But it took a l=\r\nong time for\nher to venture into the Hall without a veil and sit there like=\r\n everybody\nelse.\n\nDr. Syed and his wife used to stay in a rented house outs=\r\nide the Ashram and\ncook their own food. One day she felt a very strong desi=\r\nre to invite\nBhagavan to their house for food. She nagged her husband, but =\r\nhe did not\nhave the courage to request something so unusual. Meeting his wi=\r\nfe outside\nthe Hall was unusual enough, and twice he had asked Bhagavan to =\r\nconsent to\nit; that Bhagavan should go to their house for food seemed unthi=\r\nnkable. But\nthe intrepid lady went on pressing her husband until he became =\r\nmore afraid\nof her than of the enormity of her request and hinted her wish =\r\nto Bhagavan,\nwho smiled and kept quiet. She would not give up. She was cert=\r\nain that\nBhagavan would grant her wish if the matter were put before him in=\r\n the\nproper spirit and form. At last, while Bhagavan was going up the hill,=\r\n Dr.\nSyed and his wife stood before him and told him her desire. Bhagavan j=\r\nust\nlaughed and went up the hill.\n\nWhen they returned home in the evening, =\r\nthere was quite a row in their\nhouse, she accusing him that he had not aske=\r\nd Bhagavan in the proper way. At\nlast he had enough of it all and said to h=\r\ner: &quot;How am I responsible? The\ntruth of the matter is that your devotion is=\r\n deficient. That is the reason\nwhy Bhagavan refused.&quot; These words of his mu=\r\nst have touched her deeply and\nshe sat in meditation throughout the night. =\r\nShe wanted by sheer intensity of\nprayer to bring Bhagavan to dinner. During=\r\n the early hours of the morning\nshe must have dozed. Bhagavan appeared to h=\r\ner in a dream or vision and told\nher: &quot;Why are you so obstinate? How can I =\r\nleave the Ashram and come to your\nhouse for food? I must dine along with ot=\r\nhers, or they won&#39;t eat. Besides,\nas you know, people are coming from dista=\r\nnt places, facing a lot of trouble\nto see me and to have food with me. How =\r\ncan I leave all these guests and\ncome to your place? Feed three devotees of=\r\n mine and it will be the same as\nfeeding me. I shall be fully satisfied.&quot; I=\r\nn her vision she saw the three\ndevotees whom she had to invite. One was Dr.=\r\n Melkote, the second Swami\nPrabuddhananda and the third was myself.\n\nShe to=\r\nld of her vision to Dr. Syed, who invited all the three for food in\nhis hou=\r\nse, telling us that we could not possibly refuse. We were astonished\nand as=\r\nked him the reason. Dr. Syed told us the whole story. We were all\nBrahmins =\r\nand, although we were delighted to represent Bhagavan at the feast,\nwe were=\r\n afraid of what the Ashram Brahmins would say. For a Brahmin to eat\nin a Mu=\r\nslim&#39;s house is a serious breach of convention.\n\nDr. Melkote was in the gue=\r\nst room near the flower garden. I went to him and\nasked him, &quot;What are you =\r\nthinking about?&quot;\n&quot;I am thinking of the dinner at Syed&#39;s place.&quot;\n&quot;Are you go=\r\ning?&quot;\n&quot;I wonder. They are Muslims.&quot;\n&#39;&#39;If we go, we are bound to get into a =\r\nlot of trouble.&quot;\n&quot;Yes, they may turn us out of the Ashram.&quot;\n&quot;Then are you g=\r\noing?&quot;\n&quot;I am going,&quot; said Dr. Melkote. &quot;I am taking it as Bhagavan&#39;s direct=\r\n order.\nOtherwise, how could Mrs. Syed pick us? How could she know our name=\r\ns and\nfaces so as to show us to her husband?&quot;\n&quot;Prabuddhananda can go, for h=\r\ne is a sannyasi and can eat anywhere. Besides,\nhe is not afraid of the Ashr=\r\nam authorities, for he cooks his own food. But\nwe are taking serious risks,=\r\n&quot; I said.\n&quot;Well,&quot; said Dr. Melkote, &quot;we are going, and Bhagavan will attend=\r\n to the\nrisks.&quot;\n\nIn spite of these brave words Dr. Melkote was perplexed. W=\r\ne were to dine in\na Muslim&#39;s house. Even if the food were vegetarian, what =\r\nabout the kitchen\nand vessels? What do Muslims know about the Brahmin rules=\r\n and habits\nconcerning cleanliness? How would we explain our going to a Mus=\r\nlim house for\nfood? Why should we trust the vision of some Muslim lady? Cou=\r\nld we really\nsay that we were merely obeying Bhagavan&#39;s orders? Who would b=\r\nelieve us?\nSurely not the Ashram Brahmins! And what an assortment we three =\r\nmade! One\nwas a Kanarese householder, the other an Andhra bachelor, the thi=\r\nrd a\nBengali sannyasi!\n\nThe next day when the bell for dinner was rung, we =\r\nthree went before\nBhagavan and bowed. Bhagavan did not ask us the reason, h=\r\ne merely looked at\nus. Instead of going to the dining hall with others we m=\r\narched out of the\nAshram, passing before Chinnaswami who-O wonder!-did not =\r\nask us why we were\ngoing out without taking food.\n\nMrs. Syed got up early i=\r\nn the morning, swept the kitchen and washed the\nvessels carefully herself. =\r\nShe would not allow the servant girl to enter the\nkitchen. She had been sco=\r\nlded repeatedly by her relatives and the Muslim\nMoulvis for her devotion to=\r\n a Hindu saint. She told them that while she used\nto say her prayers she wo=\r\nuld see the Prophet standing by her side. Since she\nmet Bhagavan, the Proph=\r\net had disappeared and Bhagavan was coming to watch\nher pray. So great was =\r\nher devotion!\n\nAfter getting everything quite clean, she lovingly prepared =\r\ndish after dish,\nand when we arrived, we found the food excellent. After th=\r\ne meal she offered\nus betel with her own hands.\n\nWhen we were returning to =\r\nthe Ashram, Dr. Melkote had tears in his eyes. He\nsaid: &quot;I come from Hydera=\r\nbad and I know well the Muslim ways and customs. A\nMuslim lady will give be=\r\ntel leaves with her own hands to nobody except her\nhusband or a fakir (a sa=\r\nint). In her eyes we were fakirs, the forms Bhagavan\ntook to go to her plac=\r\ne.&quot;\n\nWhen we returned to the Ashram we were astonished that nobody enquired=\r\n why\nwe had not been present in the dining hall, where we had gone or what =\r\nwe did\nin a Muslim&#39;s house. How wonderfully does Bhagavan protect those who=\r\n obey\nhim!\n\n- From Ramana Smrti Souvenir\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org=\r\n/newsletters/1998/?pg=3Djul-aug\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=\r\n=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd13a9cd122e504829b830e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nA visitor started wailing before Bhagavan that he was being quit=\r\ne crushed under the enormity of his sins.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan asked: &quot;When=\r\n you sleep, are you a sinner?&quot;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;D: &quot;No, I am just asl=\r\neep.&quot;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bh: &quot;If you are not a sinner, then you must =\r\nbe good.&quot;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;D: &quot;No, I am neither good nor bad when I a=\r\nm asleep.
