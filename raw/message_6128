Is it truth or fiction? Does one need to keep=\r\n any caution or follow rules while praying Lord Hanuman. \n&gt; \n&gt; 2) There is =\r\na priest in a temple in Mumbai who claims that divine energy enters his bod=\r\ny every evening. He starts dancing till blood oozes of his mouth and nose. =\r\nJust like people get possessed with ghosts is there something like divine e=\r\nnergy entering a body. Is there any truth to this or just fake? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank=\r\ns and regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Priya\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
