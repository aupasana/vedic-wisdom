They can be dharmik only when a very adharmik person needs to be torn=\r\n down to pieces as he is spreading adharma in the world.\n \nNarasimha was fe=\r\nrocious because he had to kill Hiranyakashipu, who desired physical immorta=\r\nlity and invincibility and nearly got it.

We should all try to sea=\r\nrch inside to find our dharma and engage\n&gt; &gt; in actions to fulfil our dharm=\r\na. Unfortunately, it is not easy to find one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; dharma.
