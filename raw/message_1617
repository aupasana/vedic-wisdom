When he became a brahmin, his pr=\r\nofession as well as nature changed.\n\nI am inclined to say the majority betw=\r\neen the three decide the cast of the person.\n\nHow ever, birth influences th=\r\ne other 2. If you are bought up in a sudra company you will get some the su=\r\ndra qualities (like Karna getting the dasya pravRtthi). Also, you will imit=\r\nate your father and mother and will most likely get into Kula vRtthi.\n\nA pe=\r\nrson born to brahmins would see his mother, father and other engasing in go=\r\nod karmas and will automatically develop a liking for the same.

Others (interested in money, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power a=\r\nnd pleasures) are not qualified for self-realization. It has nothing \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; to do with the the birth caste.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding women:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Veda is for self-knowledge. Study and contemplation of Veda is f=\r\nor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-realization. Spiritually speaking, Shiva is the potential =\r\nenergy and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shakti is the kinetic energy. Men are supposed to have =\r\nmore Shiva than \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shakti in them and women are supposed to have more=\r\n Shakti than Shiva in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them. If a man is really like Shiva, he can =\r\nstudy and experience Veda and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realize self and his wife can realiz=\r\ne self through him. That would be a good \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; strategy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; However, men are hardly like Shiva today. In fact, there is very little \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shiva in anyone and there is more Shakti (kinetic energy) in women =\r\nas well \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as men today. Moreover, most men do not do any spiritual s=\r\nadhana at all. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rules make no sense anymore.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\nn the old days, rishis pursued knowledge and spiritual sadhana, while their=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wives ran the houses. The sadhana of rishis was sufficient for th=\r\nem and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their wives. Today&#39;s men are different. Whenever I go to a =\r\npoojas at the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; houses of friends, I see all women gathering at the =\r\npooja and chanting \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras, while all men sit elsewhere and chat a=\r\nbout sports, politics and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; movies. The world is a changed place. Wo=\r\nmen cannot rely on their men to do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual sadhana for them and =\r\nthey are on their own. Men are not like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shiva. Rules composed long=\r\n back do not apply anymore.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upasani maharaj, who was worsh=\r\nipped by Shirdi Sai Baba himself as god, was a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great Vedic scholar=\r\n who taught veda and yajna to women! I respect his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; judgment and it=\r\ns relevance today more than the relevance of an ancient \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma sha=\r\nstra. Universal dharma needs to be redefined from time to time by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nrealized souls. It becomes stale otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is the pr=\r\noblem with some religions that are based on a written text. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The te=\r\nxt may have been good for a specific desa-kaala-paatra, but may have \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; become stale now. Fortunately, sanatana dharma (aka Hinduism) does not \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; depend on one specific text. We emphasize sadhana to realize truth =\r\nrather \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than adherence to a text. This emphasis on active sadhana e=\r\nnsured a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continuous flow of realized souls.

She felt oneness with the Divine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Mother in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Her undivided supreme form (nearly nirguna form) and the riks of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Devi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sooktam were revealed to her then. Those eight r=\r\niks are really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; fantastic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There are ot=\r\nher riks in Rigveda that were revealed to the world by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; female\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rishis. We use those riks in our worship, meditation, homas and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sadhanas. Yet, should we insist that women ca=\r\nnnot recite Veda? If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Vagambhrani is amid us again as a woman, =\r\nshould we stop her from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reciting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Devi sooktam?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jnaneshwar (or Jnanad=\r\nev) was a great saint from Maharashtra from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; about 800\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; years back. He was a great devotee of Krishna and was a fully self-\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; realized\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; master at a young age. He reformed religion an=\r\nd corrected some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; corrupt\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; traditions. He once made a=\r\n buffalo chant Veda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He started to recite Veda an=\r\nd the head of the Brahmin council\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; forbade him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; becau=\r\nse he was not &quot;qualified&quot; to recite Veda. Jnaneshwar insisted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; th=\r\nat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; everyone had a right to recite Veda and the head of the cou=\r\nncil\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; disagreed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As he started reciting Veda, the Br=\r\nahmins tried to stop him by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; closing his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mouth. Then=\r\n a buffalo standing next to him took over and chanted\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Veda.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Astounded by the miracle, the Brahmins fell at his feet. The head\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; apologized\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and said, &quot;we are masquerading as the ke=\r\nepers of Veda, but you have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the real\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; understanding =\r\nand mastery of Veda&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jnaneshwar taught the equal=\r\nity of all and did not distinguish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; between people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; b=\r\nased on caste, creed or gender. He considered BhagavadGita as the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; essence\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of Veda and wrote a fantastic commentary on it. His =\r\ncommentary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; departs from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the standard Dwaitic (duali=\r\nstic) point of view adopted by most\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Vaishnava\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; gurus=\r\n and uses a purely Adwaitic (non-dualistic) point of view. It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; priceless and timeless masterpiece.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One Swamiji who was at my house last mon=\r\nth had an interesting take.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; He said\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that the belief=\r\n that women cannot recite Vedas is based on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; misinterpretatio=\r\nn. He said that the physical body we have is called\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;stree sareera&quot; and the inner body we have is called the &quot;purusha\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sareera&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He said that the physical body comes from mot=\r\nher and the soul comes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; father and that is why =\r\nthey are called so. The soul or inner self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhousand-headed purusha within us (described in purusha sooktam).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He said that Veda is supposed to be recited with the purush=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sareera.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; According to him, it does not mean that =\r\nwomen cannot read it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Whether men or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; women, they ha=\r\nve to read it with the purusha sareera, i.e. inner\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; body, and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not just with the physical body. So, according to him, the standa=\r\nrd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; convention is based on a flawed understanding. According to=\r\n him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; one simply\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reciting Veda with the mouth witho=\r\nut the correct internal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; understanding is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; only readi=\r\nng with the &quot;stree sareera&quot; and hence not doing the right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; thing.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, recitin=\r\ng Veda and chanting the verses is one thing and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; understanding =\r\nthem is quite another. When we make sound, there are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; four\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; levels of it - vaikhari, madhyama, pasyanti and para. Vibration of\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; belonging to the gross body (sthoola sareer=\r\na) produces vaikhari\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; level of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sound and it is heard=\r\n through the senses belonging to the gross\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; body (ears).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But vibrations at the level of subtle body (sookshma sareera) and\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; vibrations\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at the level of astral body (kaarana sareera=\r\n) are also there and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; perceived thorough subt=\r\nle perception.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If one is chanting &quot;Om Namo Naraya=\r\nnaya&quot; and thinking of some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mundane\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; matters, the vib=\r\nrations produced at levels above vaikhari will not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; auspicious. There is so much stress on what we do physically and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; forget that what happens at the other layers of exi=\r\nstence is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; equally, if not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more, important!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If you produce the correct vibrations at all levels (not =\r\njust\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; physical)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; while &quot;reciting&quot; any Vedic mantra, y=\r\nou can truly &quot;experience&quot; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mantra. A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; full experi=\r\nence of a single Vedic mantra may be sufficient to alter\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; one&#39;s\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; life! The mantras of Veda are most powerful. Unfortunately, so =\r\nmuch\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vedic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; scholarship these days is only superf=\r\nicial (but it has to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; encouraged,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; because it will=\r\n keep atleast one level of knowledge alive).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Forg=\r\net the man vs woman controversy. The difference between genders\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nis only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the gross body. When you go to the subtle body and =\r\nastral body,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; there is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; no difference at all. One sho=\r\nuld realize that the role of gross\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; body is too\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; limi=\r\nted in the correct recitation/experien ce of a Vedic mantra. It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nis the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; purity of the subtle body and the lightness of the astr=\r\nal body that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are far\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To be fair and balanced, I need=\r\n to throw light on the other angle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Like I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; said, Ve=\r\ndic mantras are too powerful. They are capable of producing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a fu=\r\nll\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; self-realization (actually the sole purpose of Veda is &quot;to =\r\nknow\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; self&quot;).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; However, given the depth of Kali Yuga,=\r\n it is difficult for it to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; come in one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shot. It com=\r\nes in steps. When one is half way down the path, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; has to be\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; careful and under the vigilant guidance of a sadguru.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When one is not fully realized and the gross body has a ro=\r\nle to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; play, there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are some differences based on the=\r\n gender that come into play.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If a lady carrying a=\r\n baby in her womb has certain spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; experiences\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n (which a good Vedic chanting is capable of bringing), there can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n even be an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; abortion (or a great siddha being born, on the oth=\r\ner extreme).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There is another subtle factor. Good=\r\n Vedic chanting can bring an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; awakening\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of Kundalini=\r\n (i.e. an awakening of self-awareness) and an ascent of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kundal=\r\nini (i.e. an ascent of self-awareness) . Though some people\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; may =\r\nhave a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wrong impression about Kundalini because of the corrupt=\r\n practices\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; section of so-called &quot;Kundalini sad=\r\nhakas&quot;, the fact is that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Kundalini merely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; represent=\r\ns one&#39;s ego-consciousness. When one casually associates\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the body=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one sees with &quot;self&quot;, Kundalini is asleep in the Mooladhara c=\r\nhakra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; self-awareness becomes more and mor=\r\ne refined, Kundalini ascends in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sookshma sareer=\r\na. As one has a perfect self-realization, Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reaches\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sahasrara. Whether one thinks in these terms or not, Kundalini\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; moves based\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on how evolved one is. Whether one is into=\r\n Bhakti yoga or Raja yoga\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; or Karma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; yoga or Jnana yo=\r\nga does not matter. All paths lead to an awareness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of a more\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and more correct concept of self as time progresses and a full\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; self-realization finally. Accordingly, Kundalini rises more and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; more and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reaches Sahasrara at the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; During the period when Kundalini is stuck in Swadhishthana ch=\r\nakra,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sexual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; drive can multiply. Several yogis get =\r\nstuck in this stage and fail\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to progress =\r\nfurther. In general, women have a higher drive than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; men. If that=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; drive multiplies, there can be a difficult situation. However=\r\n, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; depends on the individual and we cannot=\r\n generalize.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, there are some practical diffi=\r\nculties on the way, which may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; have made\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some people=\r\n come up with some rules. However, are those issues\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sufficient t=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ban women from reciting Veda? I don&#39;t think so. In fact, the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; factors I wrote\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; above are probably irrelevant give=\r\nn the superficial understanding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Veda\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; present at =\r\nthis time and the superficial recitation of Veda that we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; find\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; these days.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But, if you want to be sur=\r\ne and do not want to misguide anyone, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is better\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nto not give any advice. Leave it to one&#39;s sadguru. If you have a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n sadguru who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is guiding your spiritual sadhana, surrender and =\r\ndo as your guru\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; says! What\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is good for goose may no=\r\nt be good for gander. What goose&#39;s guru\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; taught to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; g=\r\noose may be good only for goose and not for gander.
