That appears to be fine to me right now because of=\r\n its simplicity. However, at some point of time i may like to graduate to m=\r\nore mantras and therefore wanted to know what different mantras to the same=\r\n deity signify. But all that can wait, if need be, so long as i get establi=\r\nshed in the main practice.\n\ni understand that total surrender and love towa=\r\nrds the deity may be the stepping stones to deepening the sadhana. However,=\r\n in my present stage of sadhana i have a long long way to go. \n\nfor many ma=\r\nny years i have been struggling with different practices thinking that the =\r\nultimate goal of all this is to feel unshakled / have the experience of inn=\r\ner freedom and joy. This has eluded me so far...and may never be part of my=\r\n present life&#39;s experience, ...but the sadhana continues in one form or ano=\r\nther...in the hope that the vighnas may dissolve, to some extent, in some s=\r\nubtle way...that i may not be aware of in my present state of consciousness=\r\n.\n\ni have started looking at ganapati as a remover of vighnas...mostly inte=\r\nrnal blocks in my case...\n\n\nyes, it appears that from a stage when rituals =\r\nappeared to be ridiculous, and i couldn&#39;t imagine which deity i could pray =\r\nto...some changes have surely come about.\n\nthankyou\n\nlove and best wishes\n\n=\r\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wr=\r\note:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Mitesh,\n&gt; \n&gt; it was a good notes from you. i enjoyed readi=\r\nng your frank thoughts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Vinitaji,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Today, the mahamrityun=\r\njaya mantra came spontaneously\n&gt; &gt;towards the end of the homam and i found =\r\nmyself reciting it &gt;\n&gt; &gt;mentally.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my opinion, if you have decided t=\r\no perform Ganapati Homam, then no need to get confused about Mantra Selecti=\r\non during Homam. for Ganapati Homam, Narasimha has suggested to do 3 specif=\r\nic Mantars/Stotra.\n&gt; Bija Mantra, Vedic Mantra and Atharvashirsha (pl. Refe=\r\nr the manual)- over and above it is perfectly fine to offer Aahutis with &#39;M=\r\nritunja Mahamantra or Gayatri Mantra or soime other nantra&#39;. I used to offe=\r\nr initially Mritunjaya and Gayatri Mantra Aahuti during Ganapati Homam but =\r\nnow since a couple of months, i have discontinued that and only stick to th=\r\ne 3 suggested above.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one performs the Homam, over period of time th=\r\ne deity will inspire saadhaka with right mantra and attitude. it is best to=\r\n live with confusions and pray MahaGanapati to do anything and everything i=\r\nncluding removal of doubts. this is offcourse my attitude and people need n=\r\not agree.\n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good Quest=\r\nion, thanks for this, it would be nice to hear more on this subject.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; I feel that from one perspective all mantras do get you to same level\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; at some point in time, if done with correct bhava and surrender etc ..\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; What we want is chit shuddhi and to get there, there is evidence\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n people have used different mantras and have reached similar higher levels =\r\nof conscoiusness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But we still have many mantras too and people ha=\r\nve very unique and differing opinion. Earlier I too felt differently about =\r\neach mantra and was curious about it them, always wanting to do the most po=\r\ntent\n&gt; &gt; and powerful mantra so that the progress speeds up but off late\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I feel differently and agree with Narasimha and other to stick to\n&gt; &gt; one=\r\n and that one mantra will do the trick, same with homa also\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I did =\r\nsome Lord Ganapati and then here and there lord krishna and goddess laxmi d=\r\nevi, lord narasimha dev etc and then due to winter stopped doing it,\n&gt; &gt; no=\r\nw I am gradually starting or thinking about them, may be start with\n&gt; &gt; lor=\r\nd ganapati homa and try to do it atleast 40 times or so and then\n&gt; &gt; may be=\r\n observe at that time what is in store in the mind and also the external ci=\r\nrcumstances.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For lord ganpati one mantra that resonates to me at t=\r\nhis time is\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Om Gam Gluam Ganpataye VighnaVinashine swaha&quot;. Please pard=\r\non my spelling errors here. I am sure others feel strongly too about other =\r\nmantras.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I feel a lot of Lord Ganapati Mantras help removing obsta=\r\ncles, and there may be special mantras for special results or expectations,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; and a lot of people feel strongly about it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I feel that one c=\r\nannot escape prarabdha karmas, when sanchit karmas take the form of prarabd=\r\nha karmas, sometimes we get good direction and get special mantras and they=\r\n may help but also at times even trying special mantras one seem to not get=\r\n any help over prarabdha karma. It is all play of conciousness and unfoldin=\r\ng or fruitification of karma.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; May be I digressed and moved in diff=\r\nerent direction, I thought it is important to see different mantras in the =\r\nlight of achiving progress in spiriruality, overcoming obstacles, and our c=\r\nuriocity at times help us get confused and lost.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do believe one =\r\nshould understand about different mantras and firmly pick quickly with conv=\r\niction one and use that mantra for some period of time without expecting an=\r\ny results or quick expectations. Again this applies towards progress in spi=\r\nrituality and not for mantras for worldly expectations. That is a different=\r\n thing altogether, for instance someone wants a child or someone wants to g=\r\net married or overcome some challenges, there are mantras for it and one sh=\r\nould consult experts on mantra shastra, and many times the karmas do play t=\r\nheir role and to the extent possible it is better to let it play and be don=\r\ne with it and move forward.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best Regards\n&gt; &gt; Mitesh\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- I=\r\nn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Pranam!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As suggested by you i have switched over to Ganap=\r\nati mantra. I picked on &quot;om gam ganapataye namah&quot; because it is short and s=\r\nimple. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My curiousity has been aroused about the different &quot;qu=\r\nality&quot; of mantras. The above mantra is supposed to be a &quot;moola&quot; mantra and =\r\nalso a &quot;bija&quot; mantra for ganapati. Can you explain the significance of this=\r\n?As a remover of obstacles which other mantra would you suggest for ganapat=\r\ni? i am drawn to &quot;aum vakratundaya hum&quot; also, but do not know how to pronou=\r\nnce the mantra correctly and neither do i know what is the &quot;correct&quot; intona=\r\ntion for this. Should i stick to one main mantra only? Today, the mahamrity=\r\nunjaya mantra came spontaneously towards the end of the homam and i found m=\r\nyself reciting it mentally. Should i resist doing this since you have advis=\r\ned that i should do Ganapati mantra at least for a month?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Than=\r\nkyou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards and best wishes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
