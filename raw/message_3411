However It is still a great idea to engage in a Spiritual practi=\r\nce.\nIt is believed that Eclipse time is not conducive to do Rituals other t=\r\nhan Japam, Meditation. Japam is considered best during that time.\nAnother t=\r\nhing is that Eclipse time is conducive for spiritual upliftment and not at =\r\nall good for any worldly desire so i guess any Sadhana done during that tim=\r\ne must only for selfless reasons without having any other sankalpa. It is p=\r\nossible though that Sadhana done without any worldly desires may sometimes =\r\navert or reduce the evil effects (which may have been pre-indicated by astr=\r\nology) of Grahana on one&#39;s worldly life.\n\nI think Narasimha has earlier sta=\r\nted that Homam can be done during Eclipse time. So you can do either Japam =\r\nor Homam but whatever you do, please forget about any other motive. Japam c=\r\nan be of any mantra and homam can also be of any deity you prefer.\n\nBest re=\r\ngards,\n\nUtpal\n   \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;metllapalli&quot; &lt;metll=\r\napalli@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; On Jan 15 what time exactly the eclipse will be in I=\r\nndia? I know it will be midnight for US. Is it ok to do homa at that time i=\r\n.e midnight? Which homa should one do for eclipse? For japa is there any sp=\r\necial mantra that one needs to chant to get the maxim benefit or any mantra=\r\n is fine? For those whom the eclipse might cause harm what mantra should th=\r\ney chant to revert the negative effect. Any other valuable suggestions as t=\r\nhis eclipse will be a big one.
