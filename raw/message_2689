I am not for this path, but, to say, that is not a =\r\npath, is perhaps unfair to all those who are destine to traverse that path.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;         My statement was not against the &quot;path of Gyana&quot;. Indeed it i=\r\ns one of the finest path I am sure.\n&gt; \n&gt;         However, my understanding =\r\nof this path differs a little from your understanding. Gyana, I believe, is=\r\n not really study of scriptures or scholarly arguments, pros and con, debat=\r\nes etc etc. Gyana, in my opinion, is a state of being,  where one percieves=\r\n a certain oneness in the universe. It is achieved through sadhana. To be c=\r\nonstantly in a state of discrimination between real and not-real, rejecting=\r\n the non-real, such that whatever is finally left is nothing but the eterna=\r\nl. This is the sadhana of the marga called Gyan. But sadhana it is without =\r\na doubt.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Whatever be the path, sadhana is a must to achieve th=\r\ne results. Adi Shankara, they say, was an expert in the scriptures and scri=\r\nptural debates. But I feel, he engaged in all these once he had already bec=\r\nome a gyani through his sadhana. He was not a gyani because he debated a lo=\r\nt or knew many scriptures, he was a gyani because he had achieved a state o=\r\nf oneness. \n&gt; \n&gt;         IMHO, scriptural knowledge is not the marg of gyan=\r\na.Gyana marg is more complex and requires more than mere intellectual abili=\r\nties.\n&gt; \n&gt;         -Regards\n&gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt;          \n&gt;         The u=\r\npsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         --- On =\r\nTue, 29/9/09, pvklnrao &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;           From: pvklnr=\r\nao &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt;\n&gt;           Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Order of Creation=\r\n (of mahabhuta/tattwa)?\n&gt;           To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;     =\r\n      Date: Tuesday, 29 September, 2009, 11:09 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;             \n&gt;   =\r\n        Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt;           With all due respect, I disagree.\n&gt; \n&gt;    =\r\n       There is no question that is useless and there is no answer that is =\r\nnot relavent. The reason we are not able to perceive God is not that God is=\r\n not there, but, given our current way of thinking, he can not be perceived=\r\n. By Sadhana, you are trying to calm your mind and infact, make your curren=\r\nt knowledge influence irrelavent which allows you to percieve thing you can=\r\n not otherwise.\n&gt; \n&gt;           There are 4 known margas for self realisatio=\r\nn. My understanding of any of these limited.\n&gt;           1. Bhakthi - Surre=\r\nnder to God. Here you rest all other thoughts but for thought pertaining to=\r\n God. You do not question any thing related to him and give-in completely t=\r\no the believe that he is there and is your master. By doing so, you are com=\r\ning out of the clutches of the regular perceptions or dimentions of this ma=\r\nterial world.\n&gt; \n&gt;           2. Raja - You focus on doing specific postures=\r\n and concentrate deeply on the way you do things and draw your self away fr=\r\nom the regular senses.\n&gt; \n&gt;           3. Karma - Unattached karma. If you c=\r\nan do it, you are not even thinking about God, but, have got him.\n&gt; \n&gt;     =\r\n      4. jnana - By questioning available information, using logic and try =\r\nto break out of current assumptions and try to discover. Saying, this will =\r\nnot yield results is not a wise thing. How ever, perhaps, this is the most =\r\ndefficult. But, with so many others who are experiancing God, not sure, why=\r\n the wrong in current axioms can not be corrected. Unfortunately, those who=\r\n are realised, do not perhaps think it is relavent.\n&gt; \n&gt;           There is=\r\n a soul. Now is Soul physical or not? Can it be seen? If not with naked eye=\r\ns, to see it materialistically, what is needed?\n&gt; \n&gt;           We can see t=\r\nhe difference between a body with prana and with out prana. Can&#39;t we? Then,=\r\n why can we try to narrow our focus and try to see prana/atma sceintificall=\r\ny?
