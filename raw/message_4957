While Narasimh=\r\na garu always mentions that merely chanting it without understanding the me=\r\naning is also excellent, keeping the gist in mind while reciting makes one =\r\naware of the goal.  \n\nWith that in mind, I was about to post a request to N=\r\narasimha garu to write up a short metaphorical representation of each battl=\r\ne, each demon and godess involved in Saptashati so one would reflect on the=\r\nmselves while reciting and make a conscious effort to conquer those interna=\r\nl enemies, and I ran into this post dated May 13, 2006.  Thought of sharing=\r\n with the members.  \n\nhttp://sanjayprabhakaran.blogspot.com/2006/05/durga-s=\r\naptashatidevi-mahatmyam.html\n\nAlso Digest Number 696, has more on surata an=\r\nd samadhi.  \n\nNarasimha garu, if you choose to shed more light on Saptashat=\r\ni, that would be wonderful too.  \n\nThank you,\n-Sunitha\n\n\n"}}
