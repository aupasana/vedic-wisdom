I am taking &#39;Ahimsa&#39; in=\r\n the context of Food habits/preferences and Hinsa involved in that. Hinsa (=\r\nInjury/Killing) involved in that is quite different than say for instance, =\r\nInjury and killing involved in Military Wars.\nIf a Tiger is attacking human=\r\n societies every now and then and killing people then it is required to be =\r\ncaptured or Killed. That Hinsa is different.\nSo now if we talk about Swa-Dh=\r\narma (As Narasimha explained earlier) or Collective society Dharma or Rasht=\r\nra Dharma, The Killing which happens during Military war can fall in Swa-Dh=\r\narma of a soldier who kills solders of the other side. It can be called Dha=\r\nrma of Group of people (Society) to kill a Man eater Tiger.\nWhat i am refer=\r\nring to again and again is the Killing involved for the reason of Food habi=\r\nts and THAT is what which can not fall under Swa-Dharma of people eating me=\r\nat. Its possible that the karma of people working in Butchery shops may not=\r\n be that heavier then the people who eat meat.\nIn my opinion, references to=\r\n Swadharma is not proper here.\n***\nIt is also correct that Most have cravin=\r\ngs for the palate. Vegetarian people also have cravings for Spicy, Hot, Swe=\r\net, etc.. food. The Major difference however is that Craving for the Veg fo=\r\nod is far better in comparison because craving for a Chicken or Mutton amou=\r\nnts directly to a loss of life.\nAgain, I think that it is not required to g=\r\no in to philosophical discussions here.\n***\nI understand that people are bo=\r\nrn with the Karma baggage of past lives. they will get the culture, family =\r\nbackground, habits etc... due to that. Mental conditioning will vary. BUT i=\r\nf a person comes to know about certain things then it is no use blaming or =\r\ntaking shelter under the circumstances. His/her will is always there. Discr=\r\nimination is always there. I dare give an advise here. if somebody wants to=\r\n change Habits which one feel to be disastrous, one can try as much possibl=\r\ne (Like Rajarshi tried for 108 days) and at the same time surrender to God.=\r\n pray every day to almighty to help and over a period of time, help will co=\r\nme. will surely come.\nI do not boast or take any pride in eating Vegetarian=\r\n food and=C2=A0my intentions are never to insult the people who eat meat.

Karama, Desh/kaal etc... does not appeal me. to be very honest. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nIn my opinon, if one can justify eating popular meat of chicken, etc.. then=\r\n anything under the Sun is eatable. with that logic, those people who choos=\r\ne to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly alright. even peop=\r\nle who have started eating human flesh are also acceptable and not doing an=\r\nything wrong as per the &#39;their&#39; thinking.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To talk about Karma, Condit=\r\nioning, Culture etc..., and try to make quality judgements by the logic of =\r\n&#39;Direct killing&#39; and &#39;eating meat of already dead&#39; does not go well with me=\r\n. it is just a philosophy to cover up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Poeple born in Those cultures =\r\nhave become Vegetarian becuase they hate killing invloved.

Thats how i a=\r\nlso take it when such people talk such nonsense.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lastly, i&#39;=\r\nll add a philospohical thought.

The flash of so c=\r\nruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the hum=\r\nans that they just overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which com=\r\nes out of water is such a disturbing site.

Same rule cannot be used to judge everyone.=C3=83=C6=92=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\nome of my non-vegetarian friends were watching discovery channel where they=\r\n showed that people in some parts of the world eat insects. My friends seem=\r\ned disgusted. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you can eat a chicken or a fish, wha=\r\nt is wrong=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 if someone eats an insect. Just=\r\n because one is born in a certain area in a certain culture in a certain se=\r\nt of value, one gets the believe that what one is not accustomed to must be=\r\n incorrect. I told them if in a future life time they were to be born in th=\r\nat place, they would gladly keep eating insects without the slightest doubt=\r\n in their mind. We humans are incorrigible product of our own conditions wh=\r\nich in my opinion is all right. BUT the problem happens when we think our c=\r\nonditions are the only possible conditioning in the world, and therefore we=\r\n wonder why don&#39;t others share similar ideas. That is incorrect. Nature has=\r\n created the world diverse, and so it is. Everything is desh-kaal-patra. A =\r\nperson\n who is\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vegetarian in this life, if he gets born in a pl=\r\nace/culture/ family in a later lifetime which=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=\r\n=A1 eats non-vegetarian food, he would not even bat an eye lid while eating=\r\n the same. I know=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 people who faint at the =\r\nsight of blood, but there are doctors who do multiple operations daily. So =\r\nmy point is, personal sensitivity can be a very good reason for an individu=\r\nal, but it=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 cannot be=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=C5=A1 a universal logic applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6=92=C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A far better angle of tackling this is the idea=\r\n of karma. Even then, if someone can make sure he is not directly killing a=\r\nn animal, not selecting a live animal to be killed, but rather buys dead me=\r\nat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily. Further, if someone=\r\n (a non-vegetarian)=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 does not want to deal =\r\nin the raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of=\r\n karma that you would get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily h=\r\nandled.=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 It is similar to the one you would=\r\n get for buying some simple daal which has come to the market through the h=\r\nands of a middle man who has cheated the farmer, or God knows what else. Th=\r\nere is karmic repurcussions in all food we eat in this age. It is unavoidab=\r\nle. There are some eggs - broiler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. They =\r\nare designed to be eaten because they never grow into an animal. Alsmot lik=\r\ne dead from birth. What karma does one get for consuming\n that? God\n&gt; knows=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An average non-vegetar=\r\nian, at least in India, to be precise is actually an omnivorous. His staple=\r\n diet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent non-veg. =\r\nFrom a scientific point of view, this is a good combination. People who fee=\r\nd on more than 60 percent non-veg food in their staple diet, are prone to s=\r\nerious heath issues at a younger age.

He was=C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;arguing from the Nonveg point of view. In short, he was saying=C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;by giving examples that People who meat are also very gentle, polite an=\r\nd good natured.=C3=82&nbsp; They are not Tamasik and such arguments. =C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;I again reiterated my view. I told him that=C3=82&nbsp;i do not say t=\r\nhat the people who eat meat are *Bad* people. I do not also claim that Pure=\r\n veggies are all and always *Good* people.=C3=82&nbsp; Infact, i have a cou=\r\nple of very good friends who are meat eater and they are really good human =\r\nbeings. =C3=82&nbsp;I only say that the people who eat meat are not doing t=\r\nhe right Karma because the act results in to cold blooded killing/ butcheri=\r\nng / massacre&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of innocent Creatures. I only say that for eating (ac=\r\ntually satisfying cravings of palate), one has no right to harm the other l=\r\nife.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; We both kept quite for a while and then i suddenly saw a adver=\r\ntisement\n poster of Mont blank pen on which Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s picture was sh=\r\nown=C3=82&nbsp;with=C3=82&nbsp;one of his thought and signature.

My only point in&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Vegterianism is related to Compession against cruelty. Dharma =\r\n(Non Violence)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; against Adharama (Killing Innocent creatur=\r\nes).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, my point is, I underst=\r\nand that it is good to eat totally vegetarian food when you engage in sadha=\r\nna, specially things like havans, or else it conflicts with your system bad=\r\nly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion, Saadhana or No Saadhana, if something =\r\nis not correct will remain Incorrect. killing for filling stomach is if Not=\r\n right then for me it&#39;ll remain *Not right in all conditions*. it is a diff=\r\nerent matter, if in future i succumb to challanging conditions and start ea=\r\nting meat but even then it&#39;ll not justify and make it proper thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi, Now i hope you don&#39;t get of=\r\nfended by my\n message. i apologise in advance for my bluntness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; your second Para and some writings in your earlier message gives me =\r\nimpression that you are heavily philosophising. Karama, Desh/kaal etc... do=\r\nes not appeal me. to be very honest. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinon, if on=\r\ne can justify eating popular meat of chicken, etc.. then anything under the=\r\n Sun is eatable. with that logic, those people who choose to eat Crab, Snak=\r\nes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly alright. even people who have started=\r\n eating human flesh are also acceptable and not doing anything wrong as per=\r\n the &#39;their&#39; thinking.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To talk about Karma, Conditioning,=\r\n Culture etc..., and try to make quality judgements by the logic of &#39;Direct=\r\n killing&#39; and &#39;eating meat of already dead&#39; does not go well with me. it is=\r\n just a philosophy to cover up.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Poeple born in Those cult=\r\nures have become Vegetarian becuase they hate killing invloved. I gave an e=\r\nxample\n of one such person and there are few more i know. howvever they are=\r\n very very very rare.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The above arg=\r\numents are incorrect.

Almost Zakir Na=\r\nik style of arguments.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree completely. it is childish=\r\n, Laughable and cruel jokes. Thats how i also take it when such people talk=\r\n such nonsense.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Lastly, i&#39;ll add a =\r\nphilospohical thought. If so much of killing every hourly basis, mostly for=\r\n the sole purpose of *Craving* goes on in the world, and the prime mover is=\r\n Human society, then how we hope to have a peacefull world without blood sh=\r\ned and massacare. unfailing law of Karma (Cause &amp; effect) will find man=\r\ny ways to give it back to (in)Human societies.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Om Shaanti=\r\n Shaanti Shaanti:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Warm Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ..&g=\r\nt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\n hope you or others won&#39;t get offended by my mails.

My point is, as a non-vegetarian I am not claiming that I hav=\r\ne any\n special sensitivity to plants, over animals. No. All I am saying is =\r\nthat,=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 this logic that many vegetarian peop=\r\nle provide to convince average non-veg people to quit eating non-veg, does =\r\nnot hold good.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I personally can not look at butchery shops where one =\r\nfinds hanging goats. its pathetic site. People in their excitements stand i=\r\nn queue to see the cutting of throat of a chicken and then take away that a=\r\ns parcel. The flash of so cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or p=\r\nig, is so tasty for the humans that they just overlook the voice of their i=\r\nnner self. a fish which comes out of water is such a disturbing site. Panti=\r\nng for water (i don&#39;t have proper English word to describe the condition of=\r\n a fish out of water). and then the dead fish thus is so tasty.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I understand and app=\r\nreciate you\n feelings, but I personally do not share them.

It is moslty a case of conditioning. What one feels =\r\ndisgusted or pained about may not affect another. Same rule cannot be used =\r\nto judge everyone.=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some of my non-v=\r\negetarian friends were watching discovery channel where they showed that pe=\r\nople in some parts of the world eat insects. My friends seemed disgusted. I=\r\n asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you can eat a chicken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=\r\n=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 if someone eats an insect. Just because one =\r\nis born in a certain area in a certain culture in a certain set of value, o=\r\nne gets the believe that what one is not accustomed to must be incorrect. I=\r\n told them if in a future life time they were to be born in that place, the=\r\ny would gladly keep\n eating insects without the slightest doubt in their mi=\r\nnd. We humans are incorrigible product of our own conditions which in my op=\r\ninion is all right. BUT the problem happens when we think our conditions ar=\r\ne the only possible conditioning in the world, and therefore we wonder why =\r\ndon&#39;t others share similar ideas. That is incorrect. Nature has created the=\r\n world diverse, and so it is. Everything is desh-kaal-patra. A person who i=\r\ns&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vegetarian in this life, if he gets born=\r\n in a place/culture/ family in a later lifetime which=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=C5=A1 eats non-vegetarian food, he would not even bat an eye lid whi=\r\nle eating the same. I know=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 people who fain=\r\nt at the sight of blood, but there are doctors who do multiple operations d=\r\naily. So my point is, personal sensitivity can be a very good reason for an=\r\n individual, but it=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 cannot be=C3=83=C6=92=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 a universal logic applicable to all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; =C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; A far bet=\r\nter angle of tackling this is the idea of karma. Even then, if someone can =\r\nmake sure he is not directly killing an animal, not selecting a live animal=\r\n to be killed, but rather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can =\r\nbe handled easily. Further, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=\r\n=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 does not want to deal in the raw flesh, he can buy some coo=\r\nked non-vegetarian food. The amount of karma that you would get for it is q=\r\nuite acceptble IMO. It can be easily handled.=C3=83=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=\r\n=A1 It is similar to the one you would get for buying some simple daal whic=\r\nh has come to the market through the hands of a middle man who has cheated =\r\nthe farmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcussions in all fo=\r\nod we eat in this age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs - broiler egg=\r\ns - which never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be eaten because they=\r\n never grow into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What karma does on=\r\ne get for\n consuming that? God&lt;BR&gt;&gt; knows.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=83=\r\n=C6=92=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=A1 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An average non-vegetari=\r\nan, at least in India, to be precise is actually an omnivorous. His staple =\r\ndiet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent non-veg. F=\r\nrom a scientific point of view, this is a good combination. People who feed=\r\n on more than 60 percent non-veg food in their staple diet, are prone to se=\r\nrious heath issues at a younger age.
