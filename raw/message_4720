Surrender is to give =\r\noneself up to\nthe original cause of one=E2=80=99s being. Do not delude your=\r\nself by imagining such\nsource to be some God outside you. One=E2=80=99s sou=\r\nrce is within yourself. Give\nyourself up to it. That means that you should =\r\nseek the source and merge in\nit. Because you imagine yourself to be out of =\r\nit, you raise the question\n=E2=80=9CWhere is the source?=E2=80=9D\n\nSome con=\r\ntend that the sugar cannot taste its own sweetness and that a taster\nmust t=\r\naste and enjoy it. Similarly, an individual cannot be the Supreme and\nenjoy=\r\n the Bliss of that state; therefore the individuality must be\nmaintained on=\r\n the one hand and God-head on the other so that enjoyment may\nresult! Is Go=\r\nd insentient(Devoid of feeling and consciousness) like sugar? How\ncan one s=\r\nurrender oneself and yet retain one=E2=80=99s individuality for supreme\nenj=\r\noyment?Furthermore they say also that the soul, reaching the divine\nregion =\r\nand remaining there, serves the Supreme Being. Can the sound of the\nword =\r\n=E2=80=9Cservice=E2=80=9D deceive the Lord? Does He not know? Is He waiting=\r\n for these\npeople=E2=80=99s service? Would not He - the Pure Consciousness =\r\n- ask in turn: =E2=80=9CWho\nare you apart from Me that presume to serve Me?=\r\n=E2=80=9D\n\nStill more, they assume that the individual soul becomes pure by=\r\n being\ndivested of the ego and fit for being the body of the Lord. Thus the=\r\n Lord is\nthe Spirit and the purified souls constitute His body and limbs! C=\r\nan there\nbe a soul for the souls? How many souls are there? The answer must=\r\n be,\n=E2=80=9CThere are many individual souls and One Supreme Soul.=E2=80=\r\n=9D What is soul in that\ncase? It cannot be the body, etc. What remains ove=\r\nr after all these are\neliminated must be said to be the soul.Thus even afte=\r\nr realising the soul as\nthat which cannot be discarded,the Supreme Soul mus=\r\nt be known to exist. In\nthat case, how was the soul realised to be the ulti=\r\nmate reality after\ndiscarding all that was alien to it? Should this be righ=\r\nt, the soul which\nwas described as that inalienable reality is not the true=\r\n soul.\n\nAll such confusion is due to the word =E2=80=98soul=E2=80=99 (atma)=\r\n. The same word atma is\nused to signify the body,the senses, the mind, the =\r\nvital principle, the\nindividual soul and the Supreme Being. This wide appli=\r\ncation of the word has\ngiven rise to the idea that the individual soul (jiv=\r\natma), goes to\nconstitute the body of the Supreme (Paramatma). =E2=80=9CI, =\r\nO Arjuna! am the Self,\nseated in the heart of all beings; ...=E2=80=9D (Bha=\r\ngavad Gita, X-20). The stanza\nshows that the Lord is the Atma (Self) of all=\r\n beings. Does it say, =E2=80=9Cthe Self\nof the selves=E2=80=9D?If, on the o=\r\nther hand, you merge in the Self there will be no\nindividuality left. You w=\r\nill become the Source itself. In that case what is\nsurrender? Who is to sur=\r\nrender what and to whom? This constitutes devotion,\nwisdom, and investigati=\r\non.\n\nAmong the Vaishnavites too, Saint Nammalvar says, =E2=80=9CI was in a =\r\nmaze,sticking\nto =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99; I wandered=\r\n without knowing my Self. On realising my Self\nI understand that I myself a=\r\nm You and that =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99 (i.e., my possessions) is\nonly You.=\r\n=E2=80=9D\n\nThus - you see - Devotion is nothing more than knowing oneself. =\r\nThe school\nof Qualified Monism also admits it. Still, adhering to their tra=\r\nditional\ndoctrine, they persist in affirming that the individuals are part =\r\nof the\nSupreme - his limbs as it were. Their traditional doctrine says also=\r\n that\nthe individual soul should be made pure and then surrendered to the S=\r\nupreme;\nthen the ego is lost and one goes to the\nregions of Vishnu after on=\r\ne=E2=80=99s death; then finally there is the enjoyment of\nthe Supreme (or t=\r\nhe Infinite)!\n\nTo say that one is apart from the Primal Source is itself a =\r\npretension; to\nadd that one divested of the ego becomes pure and yet retain=\r\ns individuality\nonly to enjoy or serve the Supreme, is a deceitful stratage=\r\nm. What duplicity\nis this - first to appropriate what is really His, and th=\r\nen pretend to\nexperience or serve Him!
