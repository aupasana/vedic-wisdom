Your b=\r\nody was so utterly shattered you were better off, trust me.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnd th=\r\nat&#39;s when you met me.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;What=E2=80=A6 what happened?&quot; You =\r\nasked. &quot;Where am I?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;You died,&quot; I said, matter-of-=\r\nfactly. No point in mincing words.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;There was a=E2=80=A6 a truck a=\r\nnd it was skidding=E2=80=A6&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Yup,&quot; I said.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;I=\r\n=E2=80=A6 I died?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Yup. But don&#39;t feel bad about it. Eve=\r\nryone dies,&quot; I said.&lt;br&gt;\nYou looked around. There was nothingness. Jus=\r\nt you and me. &quot;What is this place?&quot; You asked. &quot;Is this the =\r\nafterlife?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;More or less,&quot; I said.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Are you go=\r\nd?&quot; You asked.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Yup,&quot; I replied. &quot;I&#39;m God.&quot=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;My kids=E2=80=A6 my wife,&quot; you said.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;What about =\r\nthem?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Will they be all right?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;That&#39;s wh=\r\nat I like to see,&quot; I said. &quot;You just died and your main concern i=\r\ns for your family. That&#39;s good stuff right there.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nYou lo=\r\noked at me with fascination. To you, I didn&#39;t look like God. I just loo=\r\nked like some man. Or possibly a woman. Some vague authority figure, maybe.=\r\n More of a grammar school teacher than the almighty.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Don&#39;t wo=\r\nrry,&quot; I said. &quot;They&#39;ll be fine. Your kids will remember you a=\r\ns perfect in every way. They didn&#39;t have time to grow contempt for you.=\r\n Your wife will cry on the outside, but will be secretly relieved. To be fa=\r\nir, your marriage was falling apart. If it&#39;s any consolation, she&#39;l=\r\nl feel very guilty for feeling relieved.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Oh,&quot; you said=\r\n. &quot;So what happens now? Do I go to heaven or hell or something?&quot;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&quot;Neither,&quot; I said. &quot;You&#39;ll be reincarnated.&quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&quot;Ah,&quot; you said. &quot;So the Hindus were right,&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot=\r\n;All religions are right in their own way,&quot; I said. &quot;Walk with me=\r\n.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nYou followed along as we strode through the void. &quot;Wh=\r\nere are we going?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Nowhere in particular,&quot; I said. &quo=\r\nt;It&#39;s just nice to walk while we talk.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;So what&#39;s t=\r\nhe point, then?&quot; You asked. &quot;When I get reborn, I&#39;ll just be =\r\na blank slate, right? A baby. So all my experiences and everything I did in=\r\n this life won&#39;t matter.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Not so!&quot; I said. &quot;Yo=\r\nu have within you all the knowledge and experiences of all your past lives.=\r\n You just don&#39;t remember them right now.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\nI stopped walking an=\r\nd took you by the shoulders. &quot;Your soul is more magnificent, beautiful=\r\n, and gigantic than you can possibly imagine. A human mind can only contain=\r\n a tiny fraction of what you are. It&#39;s like sticking your finger in a g=\r\nlass of water to see if it&#39;s hot or cold. You put a tiny part of yourse=\r\nlf into the vessel, and when you bring it back out, you&#39;ve gained all t=\r\nhe experiences it had.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;You&#39;ve been in a human for the last 48=\r\n years, so you haven&#39;t stretched out yet and felt the rest of your imme=\r\nnse consciousness. If we hung out here for long enough, you&#39;d start rem=\r\nembering everything. But there&#39;s no point to doing that between each li=\r\nfe.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;How many times have I been reincarnated, then?&quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&quot;Oh lots. Lots and lots. An in to lots of different lives.&quot; I s=\r\naid. &quot;This time around, you&#39;ll be a Chinese peasant girl in 540 AD=\r\n.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Wait, what?&quot; You stammered. &quot;You&#39;re sending=\r\n me back in time?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Well, I guess technically. Time, as you k=\r\nnow it, only exists in your universe. Things are different where I come fro=\r\nm.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Where you come from?&quot; You said.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Oh sure,&=\r\nquot; I explained &quot;I come from somewhere. Somewhere else. And there ar=\r\ne others like me. I know you&#39;ll want to know what it&#39;s like there, =\r\nbut honestly you wouldn&#39;t understand.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Oh,&quot; you sai=\r\nd, a little let down. &quot;But wait. If I get reincarnated to other places=\r\n in time, I could have interacted with myself at some point.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quo=\r\nt;Sure. Happens all the time. And with both lives only aware of their own l=\r\nifespan you don&#39;t even know it&#39;s happening.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;So what=\r\n&#39;s the point of it all?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Seriously?&quot; I asked. &quot=\r\n;Seriously? You&#39;re asking me for the meaning of life? Isn&#39;t that a =\r\nlittle stereotypical?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Well it&#39;s a reasonable question,&=\r\nquot; you persisted.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI looked you in the eye. &quot;The meaning of=\r\n life, the reason I made this whole universe, is for you to mature.&quot;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&quot;You mean mankind? You want us to mature?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;No, just =\r\nyou. I made this whole universe for you. With each new life you grow and ma=\r\nture and become a larger and greater intellect.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Just me? Wh=\r\nat about everyone else?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;There is no one else,&quot; I said.=\r\n &quot;In this universe, there&#39;s just you and me.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\nYou stared =\r\nblankly at me. &quot;But all the people on earth=E2=80=A6&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;A=\r\nll you. Different incarnations of you.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Wait. I&#39;m everyo=\r\nne!?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Now you&#39;re getting it,&quot; I said, with a congra=\r\ntulatory slap on the back.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;I&#39;m every human being who ever liv=\r\ned?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Or who will ever live, yes.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;I&#39;m Abr=\r\naham Lincoln?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;And you&#39;re John Wilkes Booth, too,&quot; =\r\nI added.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;I&#39;m Hitler?&quot; You said, appalled.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;And =\r\nyou&#39;re the millions he killed.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;I&#39;m Jesus?&quot;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&quot;And you&#39;re everyone who followed him.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\nYou fell silent.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Every time you victimized someone,&quot; I said, &quot;you =\r\nwere victimizing yourself. Every act of kindness you&#39;ve done, you&#39;v=\r\ne done to yourself. Every happy and sad moment ever experienced by any huma=\r\nn was, or will be, experienced by you.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\nYou thought for a long tim=\r\ne.&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Why?&quot; You asked me. &quot;Why do all this?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quo=\r\nt;Because someday, you will become like me. Because that&#39;s what you are=\r\n. You&#39;re one of my kind. You&#39;re my child.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Whoa,&quo=\r\nt; you said, incredulous. &quot;You mean I&#39;m a god?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;No.=\r\n Not yet. You&#39;re a fetus. You&#39;re still growing.
