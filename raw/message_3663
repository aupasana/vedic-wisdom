Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; A few quick points:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; (1) There is no absolute right and wrong. Dharma often requires judging a=\r\nnd balancing different criteria and the judgment may vary from place to pla=\r\nce, time to time and person to person.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uncooked (raw) rice grains last=\r\n a long time without getting spoiled, but cooked rice grains get spoiled fa=\r\nst. Unfortunately, people cannot eat raw grains. So someone cooks for them.=\r\n Do not expect cooked grains to last a long time, even if a great cook cook=\r\ned them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, generic and raw spiritual teachings given in scrip=\r\ntures and taught by great yogis (e.g. Brahman alone is real. World is maaya=\r\na. Do good to others. Sacrifice your happiness for others) are relevant alw=\r\nays, while very specific guidelines given by great yogis in specific circum=\r\nstances (e.g. It is ok to eat fish, but focus mind on god. It is ok to do h=\r\nomam with mustard oil instead of ghee. If someone comes to you and asks for=\r\n money, give whatever you have) may have been given keeping the circumstanc=\r\nes in mind and may be irrelevant in other circumstances.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I reject s=\r\npoiled food cooked by my wife who is out of town and instead eat food made =\r\nby my sister-in-law, it is not disrespectful to my wife. She would not have=\r\n expected me to hang on to her food and eat it even after it expires.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nUnfortunately, many great yogis give specific guidelines to people based on=\r\n the circumstances (desa-kaala-paatra), as people are not smart enough to k=\r\nnow the right thing if given only generic guidelines and want specific guid=\r\nance. So they run the risk of someone using the guideline meant for a speci=\r\nfic circumstance in other inapplicable circumstances while attributing it t=\r\no them.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) Eating the meat of an animal that self-identifies with the=\r\n body parts strongly is always a much stronger karma than eating the stuff =\r\nfrom plants that have much subtler self-identification with the leaves and =\r\nvegetables they grow. Irrespective of which spiritual giants ate fish in th=\r\ne past, it is bad karma.\n&gt; \n&gt; All of us do many bad karmas and many good ka=\r\nrmas and hope for them balance out. Vivekananda and Ramakrishna did so many=\r\n good karmas, so many austerities and such intense spiritual sadhana. It ma=\r\ny have offset any bad karma accumulated by eating fish during the time they=\r\n were not yet fully realized (after full realization, there are no karmas).=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) In the old days - even a century back - people did much more sadh=\r\nana than now and lived simpler and purer lifestyles. Now-a-days, we live in=\r\n the middle of deep pollution - physical as well as spiritual - and our min=\r\nds are bombarded with so much corrupting influence. One may do a homam in t=\r\nhe evening, go and turn on the TV and the sitcom coming on TV during prime =\r\ntime may have sexual innuendo. One may check email and get a spam mail abou=\r\nt sexuality. There are images of half-naked people and struggle for money e=\r\nverywhere. There are too many temptations for the mind and too many opportu=\r\nnities to fall and commit bad karmas (physically or mentally). The world of=\r\n today is more challenging for a sadhaka than at the time of Vivekananda.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; How good shoes one wears may not matter if one is walking on a normal r=\r\noad in summer. One should better wear good shoes if one is walking on an ic=\r\ny pavement during winter, lest one should fall!\n&gt; \n&gt; When there is so much =\r\ncorrupting influence around us that we cannot control and that is challengi=\r\nng us, we can atleast control our own actions and habits and minimize the b=\r\nad karmas we regularly commit and the chance of a fall.\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) When Lord =\r\nVishnu came to earth as Lord Rama, he taught the importance of Eka Patni Vr=\r\nata (having only one wife). When he came back as Lord Krishna, he did not e=\r\nmphasize that anymore and had many wives. When he came as Lord Narasimha or=\r\n Lord Rama, he killed demons. When he came as Lord Buddha, he taught non-vi=\r\nolence.\n&gt; \n&gt; When yogis like Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi, Sai=\r\n Baba etc come also, their message is tuned for their desa-kaala-paatra. Di=\r\nfferent times require different leelas, different missions, different messa=\r\nges and different styles.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, Jaambavanta did not recognize=\r\n when Lord Rama came back as Lord Krishna and even fought with him!\n&gt; \n&gt; (5=\r\n) While it is illogical to hold Thakur, Mother and Swamiji accountable for =\r\nthe beliefs of these people, I admire their blind faith. If it is opportuni=\r\nsm, i.e. they just want to eat fish and use the icons of their organization=\r\n as an excuse, that is bad. But, if it is genuine blind faith that these ic=\r\nons were perfected beings and their words are never wrong, they will eventu=\r\nally make it. Opportunistic and egoistic faith is useless, but blind and co=\r\nmplete faith accompanied by complete surrender is very powerful. People wit=\r\nh such faith WILL find their way.\n&gt; \n&gt; (6) The nearest path from Ujjain to =\r\nKashi does not go through Calcutta. But, if someone insists on going throug=\r\nh Calcutta, what can you do? Everyone takes a spiritual path based on one&#39;s=\r\n conditioning. If we see a short path, we can only suggest it to others but=\r\n nor force them to take it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =C2=A0 Free Jyotish=\r\n Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritua=\r\nl manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make =\r\na difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =C2=A0 Jyotish writings:=\r\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; --------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fri, 2/5/10, rajarshi=\r\n nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; Su=\r\nbject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Great Vimalananda&#39;s opinion on &#39;Meat-eaters&#39;(=\r\nAghor -at the left hand of God)\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: =\r\nFriday, February 5, 2010, 9:38 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;       Dear KK,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Nice question=\r\n. I was also thinking that.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Few days back when I went to Calcutt=\r\na, (where fish is the staple diet), one person told me confidently that the=\r\nre is no harm in eating fish or meat because Swamiji used to do so, and in =\r\na Bengali book on the=C2=A0life of Sri Ramakrishna there is one example men=\r\ntioned where a man came to ask him if should quite non veg food, and suppos=\r\nedly Ramakrishna said first leave &quot;Kamini&quot; and &quot;Kanchana&quot;, then think of fo=\r\nod. =C2=A0Also a similar examples was quoted to me from=C2=A0the life of Ma=\r\n Sarada where - a certain book says - she advised an ordinary devotee again=\r\nst leaving fish eating and rather just focus mind on God.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; When I=\r\n tried to reason with them that if these people were to come back again on =\r\nplanet earth they may not recommend non veg eating - considering the state =\r\nof the world today - I=C2=A0 was catergorically told they are all Trikalagy=\r\nas, so if there is something wrong in eating fish they would have told righ=\r\nt then.=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Then I tried to say that the examples maybe speci=\r\nfic individual cases, to which I was told, &quot;no&quot;, because based on a whole p=\r\nlethora of such examples even today the monks of the Ramakrishna Order in W=\r\nest Bengal eat and serve fish.

However, you are free to address me as you feel like and I&#39;ll happily ac=\r\ncept it hence forth.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just came across Vimalananda&#39; s thought on Karm=\r\na. He says (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is only gen=\r\nerated (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it.\n&gt; Although, it ma=\r\ny seem easy to understand intellectually, the state is multiple times diffi=\r\ncult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extremely important statement to ans=\r\nwer our queries.\n&gt; \n&gt; Important information about Vimalananda which I came =\r\nto know only yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a=\r\n single day passed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking except on the fina=\r\nl day of his departure from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco=\r\n&#39; frequently and occasionally\n&gt;  ate meat. I gave this information, because=\r\n as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidenc=\r\ne of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please also note an import=\r\nant thing. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all his audience to do=\r\n what he says and not try to do what he does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now whatever I wrote abo=\r\nve seems sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Let me put in my tho=\r\nughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the=\r\n worth can be next to nothing). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekan=\r\nanda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual gi=\r\nants, we tend to forget that they are all realized souls who achieved very =\r\nhigh level of spiritual realization. They are knower of everything or many =\r\nthings in the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tu=\r\nned to universal ego. In short they *know* what they are doing. They are `T=\r\nrikaal gnyaanis&#39;.\n&gt;  Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say that =\r\nif they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they act=\r\nually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a specific purpose be=\r\nhind each and every action of theirs because as I said, they know complete =\r\nbackground behind their each action and moreover their self identification =\r\nis missing from the action and hence it is like Nature operates through the=\r\nm to accomplish a special purpose without binding them in any cause-effect =\r\nchain.\n&gt; Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren=\r\n is very different from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning wit=\r\nhin him which can consume anything and everything. A food restriction does =\r\nnot bind him. He can eat anything without getting spiritually troubled but =\r\nfor others, a kind of food intake is extremely important.\n&gt; If Vivekananda =\r\nate meat during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpose whi=\r\nch is not\n&gt;  possible for majority of us to comprehend unless explained by =\r\na person of that level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere seeke=\r\nrs amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as one of them and=\r\n then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and such other un=\r\ndesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that he is nullifyin=\r\ng some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is als=\r\no possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;s=\r\n soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no apparent reas=\r\nons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only V=\r\nivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a=\r\n boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in India and did not=\r\n even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some years actually met Swa=\r\nmi in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him to stay away from =\r\nwater\n&gt;  and when he requested swami to accept him as his disciple, swami, =\r\nafter a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and his guru will =\r\ncome later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later became di=\r\nsciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually given a =\r\ngift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami Viveka=\r\nnanda `knew&#39; before 40 years.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Vivekananda was all knowing and mo=\r\nst of us are NOT.\n&gt; \n&gt; So moral of my whole writings is that it&#39;s unwise as=\r\n well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional habits of Swam=\r\ni Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samart=\r\nh, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our completely self identifi=\r\ned and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@\n&gt;  yahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@ &gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Great coinciden=\r\nce of thoughts!!=C3=82=C2=A0I was about to ask this question today on Non-V=\r\neg eating.=C3=82=C2=A0 It is clear from the below passage meat eating is no=\r\nt advisable for anyone.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I was=C3=82=C2=A0reading a book on =\r\nSwami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he s=\r\nurvived many days on just eating meat when he was living in USA also relish=\r\ned it.
