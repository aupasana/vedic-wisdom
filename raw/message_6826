Thus even in the mutual love between husband and wife the incentive is\n=\r\none=E2=80=99s\nown desire for happiness.\n\n10. A child, when kissed by its fa=\r\nther, may cry, being pricked by the\nlatter=E2=80=99s bristly beard, still i=\r\nts father goes on kissing the child =E2=80=93 it is\nnot for its sake but fo=\r\nr his own.\n\n12. A merchant forces his bullock, though unwilling, to carry a=\r\n load. He\nloves the bullock for his own sake, how can it be for the bullock=\r\n=E2=80=99s ?\n\n60. A son is dearer than wealth, the body dearer than the son=\r\n, the\nsense-organs dearer than the body, life and mind dearer than the sens=\r\ne\norgans and the Self is supremely dearer than life and mind.\n\n65. When a m=\r\narried couple desire to have a son and do not have one, they are\ndisappoint=\r\ned and miserable. After conception, a miscarriage or the pain of\nlabour\ncau=\r\nses sorrow.\n\n66. When a son is born he may suffer from diseases or from the=\r\n position of\nthe\nplanets at his birth, or he may be stupid or obstinate, or=\r\n after the\ninvestiture of\nsacred thread, he may study nothing or if he is l=\r\nearned, he may remain\nunmarried.\n\n67. Again he may start pursuing the wives=\r\n of others, or he may have an\nunwieldy\nfamily and remain in poverty, or he =\r\nmay grow wealthy and yet die in his\nyouth.\nInfinite are the sorrows of pare=\r\nnts.\n\n68. Having considered all this, the disciple must abstain from formin=\r\ng an\nattachment\nto other things. He should focus his love on the Self and c=\r\nontemplate It day\nand\nnight.\n\n83. Knowing that for some Yoga is difficult a=\r\nnd for some others knowledge,\nthe great\nLord Sri Krishna speaks of these tw=\r\no paths.\n\nXIII. THE BLISS OF NON-DUALITY\n\n10. So the illusive appearance of=\r\n the world in the partless bliss can be\nexplained.\nLike the power of a magi=\r\ncian, the power of Maya may be said to bring the\nobjective\nworld into being=\r\n.\n\n14. =E2=80=9CThe supreme Brahman is eternal, perfect, non-dual and omnip=\r\notent=E2=80=9D, so\nsays\nthe Veda and Vasistha supports this.\n\n18. =E2=80=98=\r\nJust as a tree with its fruits, leaves, tendrils, flowers, branches,\ntwigs =\r\nand roots is latent in the seed, so does this world abide in Brahman=E2=80=\r\n=99.\n\n20. =E2=80=98O Rama, when the all-pervasive, eternal and infinite Sel=\r\nf assumes the\npower of\ncognition, we call it the mind=E2=80=99\n\n21. =E2=80=\r\n=98O Prince, first arises the mind, then the notion of bondage and release\n=\r\nand then the universe consisting of many worlds. Thus all this manifestatio=\r\nn\nhas been fixed or settled (in human minds), like the tales told to amuse\n=\r\nchildren=E2=80=99.\n\n27. =E2=80=98Thus to those who have no discrimination t=\r\nhe world appears to be real\nlike the\ntale repeated to the child=E2=80=99.\n\n=\r\n35. The pot is not different from the clay, as it has no existence apart\nfr=\r\nom the clay; it is neither identical with the clay, as in the unmoulded\ncla=\r\ny it is not perceived.\n\n47. Though a man appears head downwards when reflec=\r\nted in water, he is not\nso.\nNo one would ever mistake it for the real perso=\r\nn standing on the bank.\n\n48. According to the doctrine of the non-dualists,=\r\n such knowledge (i.e., the\nknowledge of the unreality of the superimposed t=\r\nhing, the world), gives\nliberation,\nthe supreme goal of life. As the substr=\r\natum clay is not rejected, the\nappearance of a\npot in it is accepted.\n\n49. =\r\nIn an actual modification of the substratum, when milk is turned into\ncurd =\r\n(for\nexample), the former form, milk, disappears. But in the modification o=\r\nf clay\ninto a\npot or gold into an ear-ring, the substratum does not change.=\r\n\n\n50. (Doubt): When a pot is broken into pieces, they do not resemble the\no=\r\nriginal\nclay, for broken pieces only are seen. (Reply): It is not so, for w=\r\nhen\nreduced to\npowder they do. The persistence of gold in the ear-ring is v=\r\nery clear.\n\n62. The nature of Brahman is existence, consciousness and bliss=\r\n, whereas the\nnature of the world is name and form. In the Nrisimha-Uttara-=\r\nTapaniya\nUpanishad existence, consciousness and bliss are said to be the\n=\r\n=E2=80=98indications=E2=80=99 of Brahman.\n\n64. After creating names and for=\r\nms Brahman remains established in His\nnature, i.e.,\nremains as immutable as=\r\n ever, says the Purusha Sukta. Another Shruti says\nthat\nBrahman as the Self=\r\n reveals names and forms.\n\n65. Another Shruti says that before creation the=\r\n universe was unmanifest and\nthat\nafterwards it became manifest as name and=\r\n form. Here Maya, the inexplicable\npower\nof Brahman, is referred to as =E2=\r\n=80=98unmanifest=E2=80=99.\n\n69. Sri Krishna said to Arjuna: =E2=80=98O desc=\r\nendant of Bharata, beings are\nunmanifest in the beginning, manifest in the =\r\npresent and unmanifest again at\nthe end=E2=80=99.\n\n79. Both name and form a=\r\nre without any real existence because they are\nsubject to\ncreation and dest=\r\nruction. So know them as superimposed by the intellect on\nBrahman, just as =\r\nwaves and foam are on the ocean.\n\n86. Just as in the sleeping state a power=\r\n inherent in the Jiva gives rise to\nimpossible dreams, so the power of Maya=\r\n inherent in Brahman, projects,\nmaintains and destroys the universe.\n\n90. I=\r\nn a sleeping man various dreams are created; similarly the power of\nMaya\ncr=\r\neates diverse appearances in the immutable Brahman.\n\n92. Brahman characteri=\r\nsed as existence, consciousness and bliss is the\ncommon\nbasis of both the a=\r\nnimate and inanimate objects; they differ only in their\nnames and\nforms.\n\nS=\r\nource: http://www.celextel.org/othervedantabooks/panchadasi.html\n\n-- \n=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636834014d7cd0a04a7b10016\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;Translated by Swami Swahananda Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chenna=\r\ni&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;9.
