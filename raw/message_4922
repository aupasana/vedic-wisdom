Each person is a microcosm of the universe. All worlds and beings of this universe correspond to (and resonate to) the corresponding inner worlds and inner beings within the microcosm.\n \nBrahma rakshasas are evil beings who were very learned and lived as brahmanas, but committed evils and became demonic.\n \nThere is a spiritual seeker inside each of us, who seeks knowledge and liberation. This inner being (i.e. personification of an inner quality) is a brahmana. As this brahmana is rewarded with knowledge and experiences, he MAY become proud and get distracted from the final goal of liberation. Demonical qualities such as pride may develop and grow. One is then blocked from further spiritual progress.\n \nWhen one does sacrifice or yajna - internal or external - or any sadhana for that matter, there is always a chance of being rewarded with some knowledge, insights, special abilities etc. If the spiritual seeker inside one becomes proud and gets distracted, that means that a Brahma Rakshasa has developed inside one and blocks one from further spiritual progress.\n \nYes, in any spiritual sadhana or internal/external fire ritual, there is a risk from Brahma Rakshasa. But do not expect a ghost or ghoul to appear in front of you, like in movies. This is mainly an internal challenge. That is why I keep repeating that spiritual experiences, obtaining of spiritual insights, getting more and more knowledge, should not increase pride and distract one from the final goal of complete surrender.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Veneet Kumar &lt;kveneet@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; I came across the following shloka in Mahabharata, Sabhaparva, where Narada says to Yudhishthira that Rajasooya Yajna is difficult to perform and is full of obstacles.\n&gt; \n&gt; ??????????? ????? ???????? ?????? ??????\n&gt; \n&gt; ???????????? ?? ??????? ???????? ???????????????\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; While ordinary yajnas do not compare with the Rajsooya, still a few interesting points seem to come across.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some evil species called Brahma rakshasas are said to look for loopholes in the Rajsooya Yajna.
