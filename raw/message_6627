Immediately a north indian who was b=\r\nuying other puja stuff too chimed in and said &quot;loha kaa havan kund hota hai=\r\n&quot; ! \nSo, I purchased Iron homa kund ! Apart from gunas, etc is there a reas=\r\non why there is a difference of opinion on which metal kund has to be used =\r\n? \n\nDoes the main homam mantras need to be counted? I am doing it by keepin=\r\ng some time limit to it and not counting !\n\nLastly, I did not find any homa=\r\nm manual that goes along with sandhya vandanam ! Someone I respect, mention=\r\ned of AupAsana homam done with daily sandhya vandanam of which 10% of mantr=\r\nas are offered to Agni. In fact, he mentioned it is the duty of every house=\r\nholder. Would any one here have some article or manual for it ? \n\nThanks ag=\r\nain for your time.\n\nregards\nPrasad\n\n\n\n"}}
