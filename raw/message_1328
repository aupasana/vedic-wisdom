The commercial iLeap \nsoftware from C-DAC is good - one can type the text once in English and then \nget it in all Indian languages. But it has no support for intonation marks.\n\nIf someone can volunteer to type all the mantras in Telugu (or Tamil or \nGujarati etc) in iLeap or some other software and save various pieces of \nmantra text as gif pictures and manually add intonation marks (one or two \nvertical lines on top or a horizontal line at bottom) in all mantras, it is \npossible to replace the Devanagari and Roman text in manual with those \npictures. In fact, if one can translate the entire manual into Telugu and \nother languages and paste the mantras saved as pictures as mentioned \nearlier, it is then possible to have manuals completely in various Indian \nlanguages. If anybody is interested and has time and energy and understands \nwhat I am saying, they can volunteer.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Venkat Chavakula&quot; &lt;cvrkumar@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, February 26, 2009 5:22 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Question: Need Homam Scripts in Telugu, if possible\n\n\n&gt; Hello PVR Gaaru,\n&gt;\n&gt; If possible can you please forward me the Telugu scripts of the Homam.\n&gt;\n&gt; Daily I hear and see your Ganapathi homam downloaded from google, and\n&gt; became a fan follower, trust me.  This has become a habit for the past\n&gt; couple of months.\n&gt;\n&gt; I guess, if I do Homam on my own will get benefited, hence this\n&gt; request.  Currently I&#39;m going through Sade Sathi period, want to do\n&gt; both Ganapathi Homam and Sani Homam.\n&gt;\n&gt; I&#39;m worried to do Homam on my own as I may mis-spell the mantras, as\n&gt; I&#39;m not profecient with Hindi.  I have observed some difference between\n&gt; Hindi and English scripts, hence requesting you to forward me the\n&gt; Telugu Homam Scripts if you have and if possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks in anticipation,\n&gt;\n&gt; CVRKumar.\n\n\n"}}
