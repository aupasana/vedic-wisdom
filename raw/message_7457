At that time I made mp3=\r\n of atharv shirsham from your mahaganapati homam video and got a pleasant s=\r\natisfaction/contentment/serenity in listening to your chanting. If i am not=\r\n wrong i could sense that somehow the consciousness of the person chanting =\r\naffects strotra.\n\n(I had mailed you that copy with request to make it avail=\r\nable for all on your site, I didn&#39;t share or uploaded it as I didn&#39;t have y=\r\nour permission)\n\nFor last 2 days I got a great urge to ask you again for LN=\r\nH chanting with a note that I might have to ask through devi first. Guess I=\r\n jumped the note part. So dont listen to your inner voice for next few days=\r\n, let me talk to devi first. :)\n\nRather than going for simpler alternative,=\r\n I would rather request devi to persuade you. \n\nBut its nice to know that t=\r\nhese kind of samput are allowed. Ofcourse its better if these directions co=\r\nme from some serious sadhak rather than ones own inclination.\n\nregards,\nPri=\r\nyank\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; My friend,\n&gt; \n&gt; Lakshmi Narayana Hridayas are supposed to be kep=\r\nt secretive. I am not \n&gt; even supposed to mention their existence or my use=\r\n of those or share \n&gt; their texts publicly. Forget then about making one&#39;s =\r\nchant public.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, I am a very liberal person and do not hesitate to b=\r\nreak rules if it \n&gt; makes sense to me, especially in the matter of sharing =\r\nwith others and \n&gt; enabling others in sadhana. However, I&#39;ve come to realiz=\r\ne that some of \n&gt; these rules do have a reason and are still relevant. So o=\r\nne needs to be \n&gt; cautious.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let me think about it. If my inner voice s=\r\nays ok, I will do it later.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you find this text complicated (persona=\r\nlly, I find it really \n&gt; beautiful and derive an inexpressible pleasure fro=\r\nm the text when I \n&gt; chant it), I can suggest a simpler alternative.\n&gt; \n&gt; C=\r\nhant Lakshmi Ashtottara Shata Nama stotram (14 verses from &quot;Prakritim \n&gt; Vi=\r\nkritim Vidyam&quot; to &quot;Namami Bhuvaneshvarim&quot;) by doing samputikarana with \n&gt; &quot;=\r\nSrirama Rama Rameti&quot; verse. Then read Vishnu Sahasra Nama Stotram (108 \n&gt; v=\r\nerses from &quot;Vishwam Vishnur Vashatkaro&quot; to &quot;Srimannarayano Vishnur \n&gt; Vasud=\r\nevobhirakshatu&quot;) by doing samputikarana with &quot;Sarva Mangala \n&gt; Mangalye&quot; ve=\r\nrse. This gives a similar effect as chanting Lakshmi \n&gt; Narayana Hridayam.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Samputikarana of a prayer containing Verse1, Verse2, Verse3, ...VerseN=\r\n \n&gt; with verse VerseSamput means reading as follows: VerseSamput Verse1 \n&gt; =\r\nVerseSamput Verse2 VerseSamput Verse3 VerseSamput ....
