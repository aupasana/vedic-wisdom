Comming from your experience of almost 2 =\r\ndecades at the highest level, it sets somethings very clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; you wrote=\r\n following 2 lines\n&gt; &quot;what decides the nature of one&#39;s worship is not just =\r\nthe name used for the deity and the prayer used, but also the intention and=\r\n attitude.&quot;\n&gt; &quot;The vibrations created in the consciousness are a function o=\r\nf which deity/prayer is used and with which intention/attitude.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; First=\r\n line says that we control the intention and attitude and choice of diety.\n=\r\n&gt; Second line says that our own consciousness is/becomes a function of diet=\r\ny/prayer and intention/attitude.\n&gt; \n&gt; from my limited understanding It mean=\r\ns it is/becomes a closed loop. we cant clearly say who chooses whome. are w=\r\ne just mere puppets or is there a choice we have?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. \n&gt; =\r\nNow that you have made clear that Ishta devata and perfect devotion is the =\r\nbest remedy for all afflictions (short term/longterm).\n&gt; \n&gt; - What are the =\r\nthing we can/should learn from our kundali?\n&gt; - What are the best questions=\r\n to ask to an astrologer?\n&gt; - What is the proper approach/perspective going=\r\n for kundali reading?\n&gt; - Is there anything substantial we can learn form o=\r\nur kundali apart form asking quickfix for our karmas and asking for money/p=\r\nosition/future?\n&gt; - What we can learn form this map? because this certainly=\r\n isnt the territory itself, or is it in territory in terms of consciousness=\r\n?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * * * \n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Some places i have read that a kundali does predic=\r\nt future lifetimes also. \n&gt; \n&gt; - Do we live one lifetime at a time with som=\r\ne free will or many lifetimes are set with limited free will\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; 4. Your car dent example is very clear. in light of this the question see=\r\nms silly. \n&gt; \n&gt; I guess this is the nature of knowledge/perspective itself.=\r\n once you know the higher truth, the lower one automatically drops away. st=\r\nrange is the play of the consciousness!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; Priyank\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasim=\r\nha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Priyank,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. Perfect =\r\ndevotion to any one form of god is enough to take care of all \n&gt; &gt; aspects =\r\nof one&#39;s life. Though different forms work differently in the \n&gt; &gt; short ru=\r\nn (though they lead to the same thing in the long run), choosing \n&gt; &gt; forms=\r\n based on horoscope is not foolproof. I have studied various \n&gt; &gt; classics =\r\nand modern works on astrology and know the subject as \n&gt; &gt; thoroughly as an=\r\nybody on earth today. I can declare confidently that \n&gt; &gt; astrology is not =\r\nreliable for deciding the deities to worship.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, what decides t=\r\nhe nature of one&#39;s worship is not just the name used \n&gt; &gt; for the deity and=\r\n the prayer used, but also the intention and attitude. \n&gt; &gt; The vibrations =\r\ncreated in the consciousness are a function of which \n&gt; &gt; deity/prayer is u=\r\nsed and with which intention/attitude.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. Suppose there is a dent =\r\non the side of my car that makes it a little \n&gt; &gt; difficult to close the do=\r\nor. If I do not care about how good my car \n&gt; &gt; looks and the little diffic=\r\nulty in closing the door, I may not want to \n&gt; &gt; spend money and get it rep=\r\naired. I can use that money for something \n&gt; &gt; better.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For someone=\r\n like Ramana Maharshi or Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, body is \n&gt; &gt; just as exte=\r\nrnal as a car. One who identifies mainly with the body will \n&gt; &gt; be so conc=\r\nerned with bodily problems, but not one whose identification \n&gt; &gt; with the =\r\nbody is bare minimum.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. As we pray, god gives what we seek. He al=\r\nso creates situations that \n&gt; &gt; make us wonder if we are seeking the right =\r\nthings. We can improve in \n&gt; &gt; what we seek. As we evolve, we may seek some=\r\nthing better and god may \n&gt; &gt; eventually give it too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Parents may =\r\ngive a small child a toy. They may give an older child a \n&gt; &gt; book to read.=\r\n They may give an even older child some work to do.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In fact, an ad=\r\nult son may work and bring money to buy toys for the \n&gt; &gt; smaller children.=\r\n Some saints take on suffering so that some other \n&gt; &gt; people are spared of=\r\n the suffering as they embark on their spiritual \n&gt; &gt; journey.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bes=\r\nt regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; &gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, J=\r\nyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pi=\r\ntri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n  Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;       Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: =\r\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;                       Twi=\r\ntter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
