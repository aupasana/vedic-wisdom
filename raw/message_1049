Everything tends to have two sides,\n\ndepending =\r\non our state of mind one side resonates more than other.\n\n\n\nNow with respec=\r\nt to ista devata, we can deviate little bit here. I\n\nhave seen two types of=\r\n sadgurus, one type that always give same mantra\n\nto all their disciples as=\r\n they have realized that mantra and have full\n\nconfidence in it. There is a=\r\nlso other type which give out mantras\n\nbased on the disciple, some examples=\r\n are Ramakrishna paramhans and the\n\nGuruji of famous astrologer Shri K N Ra=\r\no. Both types of Sadgurus were\n\nvery capable to see the past. present and f=\r\nuture of their respective\n\ndisciples. So both these methodolgies are correc=\r\nt. How do we\n\nexplain/apply here the concept of ista devata and bhadkesh in=\r\n this case.\n\n\n\nFurther I have read in a book about a disciple of Swami Rama=\r\nnanda( The\n\nvery realized saint who started ramanandi samparadaya) . There =\r\nused to\n\nbe one king in Rajasthan, he was a devi upashak, devi used to mani=\r\nfest\n\nto him and so he was asked for a boon by devi and he asked for\n\nmooks=\r\nha. The devi indicated to him that she cannot grant it, but he\n\nshould go t=\r\no Swami Ramananda and become his disciple and get\n\ninitiation from him, tha=\r\nt will get him Mooksha. Also if you look at\n\ndisciples of Swami Ramanada, l=\r\nike Ravidas, Kabir, and many others they\n\nall had very unique experiances a=\r\nnd different types of devotion,\n\nMirabai was a krishna devotee.\n\n\n\nSo we ca=\r\nn easily conclude that the ista devata has many forms and it\n\nis a concept =\r\nthat applies to many births rather than just one birth.\n\n\n\nIsta devata to c=\r\nlear up ones sanskars can in one life also take the\n\nrole of bhadkesh and a=\r\nlso a different form.\n\n\n\nThe most important thing is one should respect all=\r\n forms and pursue a\n\nform rigourously to which one is attracted most, rest =\r\nall will fan out\n\nin time, there are no short cuts.\n\n\n\nFrom an astrology pe=\r\nrspective, there is some confusion too,\n\nIsta devata is computed from the 1=\r\n2th house from atmakaraka in D9\n\nchart. However for atmakaraka some people =\r\ninclude rahu and some donot.\n\nThere is 7 karaka scheme or 8 karaka scheme a=\r\nnd then there is also\n\nkaraka replacement. Based on this one can get potent=\r\nially 3 different\n\natmakarakas and so 3 different ista devatas. So which is=\r\nta devata to pick?\n\n\n\nIt appears to me that we are not that advanced to rel=\r\nate concepts of\n\nastrology and spiritualism perfectly yet. There is still l=\r\not of gray area.\n\n\n\nHope this helps you to stir some more thoughts in your =\r\nmind and see\n\nthings differently.\n\n\n\nBest Regards\n\nMitesh\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-w=\r\nisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;waspieswaspies&quot;\n\n&lt;waspieswaspies@ ...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n&gt; Miteshji Namaste!\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Thank you very much for your post. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I th=\r\nink I understand what you mean.

The role of\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ishta devata=\r\n \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to give moksha. Moksha is the state of non-distinction betwee=\r\nn\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; objects of \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; universe. &quot;Supreme cosmic being&quot; (known by va=\r\nrious names) is the\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; observer of \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all with non-distinction a=\r\nnd the gate to moksha. Several deities \n\n&gt; &gt; play \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific roles =\r\nin the universe at the lower level and become one \n\n&gt; &gt; with \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supr=\r\neme cosmic being at a higher level. Accordingly, one may start\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prayi=\r\nng \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to a specific form of a deity with a specific role in the \n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; universe,\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; later \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realize a higher form of the deity and t=\r\nhen become liberated \n\n&gt; &gt; through\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; higher form.\n\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For this reason, some (especially some gurus at Sri Jagannath=\r\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Centre) even \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say that only Vishnu&#39;s incarnations can be i=\r\nshta devatas giving\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; moksha and \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other deities cannot be. Th=\r\nis is partly logical, but based on a \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misconception. Vishnu here r=\r\nefers to sarva vyaapakeswara (all-\n\n&gt; &gt; pervading \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lord). If one r=\r\nealizes an all-pervading form of Ganesha or Surya \n\n&gt; &gt; or\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lakshmi \n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or Kaali or Shiva or Subrahmanya, then too that form qualifies as =\r\n\n\n&gt; &gt; ishta \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devata who enables moksha (liberation) . For example,=\r\n Ganapathi \n\n&gt; &gt; Atharva \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seersham describes a supreme cosmic bein=\r\ng form of Ganapathi, from \n\n&gt; &gt; whom \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva com=\r\ne. Suryopanishat describes a supreme \n\n&gt; &gt; cosmic \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being form of S=\r\nurya, from whom Brahma, Vishn and Shiva come. And \n\n&gt; &gt; so on.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; One may start with the worship of Ganesha who removes obstacles \n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; and\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; finally \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realize a form of Ganesha that is beyond gun=\r\nas and from whom \n\n&gt; &gt; Brahma,\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vishnu, \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shiva, Surya, Agni,=\r\n Vaayu etc are born. One may start with the\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worship of \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lak=\r\nshmi who gives prosperity and money and finally realize a form \n\n&gt; &gt; of\n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Lakshmi \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who drives the thoughts and actions of all beings. On=\r\ne may start\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worship of Saraswati who gives knowle=\r\ndge and finally realize a \n\n&gt; &gt; form of \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Saraswati who is the root=\r\n of all creation.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, one starts worshipping one&#39;s ish=\r\nta devata and slowly \n\n&gt; &gt; evolves to \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worshipping a higher all-pe=\r\nrvading form of that deity, who may\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem like a =\r\ndifferent deity to a casual observer. This is the \n\n&gt; &gt; natural \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nrocess of evolution.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Saptashati rahasya associated with saptashati (Chandipath) \n\n&gt; &gt; descri=\r\nbes\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; process of creation. It says that first there was =\r\nMahalakshmi with\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; three \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gunas. She divided herself into 3 p=\r\narts - Mahakali with tamas \n\n&gt; &gt; (ichchhaa \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sakti - the force behi=\r\nnd desire), Mahalakshmi with sattwa (jnaana\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sakti - \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fo=\r\nrce behind knowledge) and Mahasaraswati (kriyaa sakti - the \n\n&gt; &gt; force \n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; behind action) with rajas. The 3 parts of Chandipath are devoted \n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; to the \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; three.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, trigunatmika Mahalakshm=\r\ni is the root energy driving the \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desires/thoughts, knowledge/perc=\r\neptio n and actions of all beings \n\n&gt; &gt; in\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; universe.\n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, chapter 11 towards the end of Chandipath prays =\r\nto Devi \n\n&gt; &gt; (divine \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mother) after all her exploits and addresse=\r\ns Her in the prayer as \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Naaraayani&quot; (energy of Narayana). If one =\r\nviews Naaraayana as\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; supreme cosmic \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being from whom Brahma,=\r\n Vishnu and Shiva came, trigunatmika\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahalakshami (or \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nara=\r\nyani) is his energy.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the Divine Mother of Chandipa=\r\nth is not really different \n\n&gt; &gt; from \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mahalakshmi I have been wor=\r\nshipping for many years.

I \n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; later realized that a higher form of the same deity is the energy \n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; of \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narayana (supreme cosmic being) and She is responsible for t=\r\nhe \n\n&gt; &gt; birth, \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sustenance and destruction of all beings includin=\r\ng Brahma, Vishnu\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Shiva.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whichever deity you are attached to and worship as your i=\r\nshta\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; devata, please \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try to imagine that deity as the all-p=\r\nervading supreme cosmic \n\n&gt; &gt; being\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom the entire c=\r\nreation evolves.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F=\r\nree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nee Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri=\r\n Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n&gt; &gt;  \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;raja=\r\nrshi14@ &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thur=\r\nsday, January 15, 2009 11:44 PM\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Question o=\r\nn Istha devata to Narasimhaji\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji\n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was reading up on the old mail about how your started d=\r\noign \n\n&gt; &gt; Chandi\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Homa.

Everything tends to have two sides,&lt;br&gt;\ndepending on our state of mind one side resonates more than other.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNow with respect to ista devata, we can deviate little bit here. I&lt;br&gt;\nhave seen two types of sadgurus, one type that always give same mantra&lt;br&gt;\nto all their disciples as they have realized that mantra and have full&lt;br&gt;\nconfidence in it. There is also other type which give out mantras&lt;br&gt;\nbased on the disciple, some examples are Ramakrishna paramhans and the&lt;br&gt;\nGuruji of famous astrologer Shri K N Rao. Both types of Sadgurus were&lt;br&gt;\nvery capable to see the past. present and future of their respective&lt;br&gt;\ndisciples. So both these methodolgies are correct. How do we&lt;br&gt;\nexplain/apply here the concept of ista devata and bhadkesh in this case.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFurther I have read in a book about a disciple of Swami Ramananda( The&lt;br&gt;\nvery realized saint who started ramanandi samparadaya) . There used to&lt;br&gt;\nbe one king in Rajasthan, he was a devi upashak, devi used to manifest&lt;br&gt;\nto him and so he was asked for a boon by devi and he asked for&lt;br&gt;\nmooksha. The devi indicated to him that she cannot grant it, but he&lt;br&gt;\nshould go to Swami Ramananda and become his disciple and get&lt;br&gt;\ninitiation from him, that will get him Mooksha. Also if you look at&lt;br&gt;\ndisciples of Swami Ramanada, like Ravidas, Kabir, and many others they&lt;br&gt;\nall had very unique experiances and different types of devotion,&lt;br&gt;\nMirabai was a krishna devotee.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nSo we can easily conclude that the ista devata has many forms and it&lt;br&gt;\nis a concept that applies to many births rather than just one birth.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIsta devata to clear up ones sanskars can in one life also take the&lt;br&gt;\nrole of bhadkesh and also a different form.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThe most important thing is one should respect all forms and pursue a&lt;br&gt;\nform rigourously to which one is attracted most, rest all will fan out&lt;br&gt;\nin time, there are no short cuts.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nFrom an astrology perspective, there is some confusion too,&lt;br&gt;\nIsta devata is computed from the 12th house from atmakaraka in D9&lt;br&gt;\nchart. However for atmakaraka some people include rahu and some donot.&lt;br&gt;\nThere is 7 karaka scheme or 8 karaka scheme and then there is also&lt;br&gt;\nkaraka replacement. Based on this one can get potentially 3 different&lt;br&gt;\natmakarakas and so 3 different ista devatas. So which ista devata to pick?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nIt appears to me that we are not that advanced to relate concepts of&lt;br&gt;\nastrology and spiritualism perfectly yet. There is still lot of gray area.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHope this helps you to stir some more thoughts in your mind and see&lt;br&gt;\nthings differently.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBest Regards&lt;br&gt;\nMitesh&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;waspieswaspies&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;waspieswaspies@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Miteshji Namaste!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Thank you very much for your post. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I think I understand what you mean.

It said something like&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; - if you have a basket of tomatoes and some are rotten at the top, you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have to throw away the rotten one&#39;s first before you can get to the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; bottom to the good ones. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; But I tend to think that the purpose of Jyotish Vidya is Bhagwaan&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; gift to us in order to alleviate the suffering of others and help them&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; reach Moksha. I think that&#39;s why I find it hard to reconcile the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; concept of Badhakesh and Ishta Devta being one and the same. But then&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; again, the Ishta Devta works in too mysterious ways for my limited&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; mortal mind to understand! :-)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Many thanks.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- In &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Interesting post, about ista devata and Bhadkesh.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; How can ista devata be negative?

Not only did &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; native encounter obstacles in starting worship to Lord MahaVishnu &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there were also problems (accidents, problems in workplace) when &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; they&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; started a regular recitation of the VishnuSahasranaam which they &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; have&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have stopped now because of fear of more bad things happening. They&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; only continue their DurgaMaa/Chandi worship which they have always&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; felt naturally inclined to. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What is the significance of this and what can one do when Ishta &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Devata&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is also the Badhakesh?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you for taking the time to read my post.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

The role of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ishta devata &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is to give moksha. Moksha is the state of non-distinction between&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; objects of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; universe. &quot;Supreme cosmic being&quot; (known by various names) is the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; observer of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all with non-distinction and the gate to moksha. Several deities &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; play &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific roles in the universe at the lower level and become one &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; with &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supreme cosmic being at a higher level. Accordingly, one may start&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; praying &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to a specific form of a deity with a specific role in the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; universe,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; later &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realize a higher form of the deity and then become liberated &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; through&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; higher form.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For this reason, some (especially some gurus at Sri Jagannath&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Centre) even &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; say that only Vishnu&#39;s incarnations can be ishta devatas giving&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; moksha and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other deities cannot be. This is partly logical, but based on a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misconception. Vishnu here refers to sarva vyaapakeswara (all-&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; pervading &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lord). If one realizes an all-pervading form of Ganesha or Surya &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lakshmi &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or Kaali or Shiva or Subrahmanya, then too that form qualifies as &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ishta &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devata who enables moksha (liberation) . For example, Ganapathi &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Atharva &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Seersham describes a supreme cosmic being form of Ganapathi, from &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; whom &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva come. Suryopanishat describes a supreme &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; cosmic &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being form of Surya, from whom Brahma, Vishn and Shiva come. And &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; so on.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One may start with the worship of Ganesha who removes obstacles &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; finally &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realize a form of Ganesha that is beyond gunas and from whom &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Brahma,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vishnu, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shiva, Surya, Agni, Vaayu etc are born. One may start with the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; worship of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lakshmi who gives prosperity and money and finally realize a form &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Lakshmi &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who drives the thoughts and actions of all beings. One may start&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worship of Saraswati who gives knowledge and finally realize a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; form of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Saraswati who is the root of all creation.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, one starts worshipping one&#39;s ishta devata and slowly &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; evolves to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worshipping a higher all-pervading form of that deity, who may&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sometimes &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seem like a different deity to a casual observer. This is the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; natural &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; process of evolution.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Saptashati rahasya associated with saptashati (Chandipath) &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; describes&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; process of creation. It says that first there was Mahalakshmi with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; three &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gunas. She divided herself into 3 parts - Mahakali with tamas &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (ichchhaa &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sakti - the force behind desire), Mahalakshmi with sattwa (jnaana&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sakti - &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the force behind knowledge) and Mahasaraswati (kriyaa sakti - the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; force &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; behind action) with rajas. The 3 parts of Chandipath are devoted &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; three.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, trigunatmika Mahalakshmi is the root energy driving the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desires/thoughts, knowledge/perceptio n and actions of all beings &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; universe.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, chapter 11 towards the end of Chandipath prays to Devi &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (divine &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mother) after all her exploits and addresses Her in the prayer as &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Naaraayani&quot; (energy of Narayana). If one views Naaraayana as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; supreme cosmic &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; being from whom Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva came, trigunatmika&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mahalakshami (or &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narayani) is his energy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the Divine Mother of Chandipath is not really different &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; from &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mahalakshmi I have been worshipping for many years. I originally&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; started out &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worshipping Lakshmi with 4 hands who sita on a lotus and gives &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; money. I &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later realized that a higher form of the same deity is the energy &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narayana (supreme cosmic being) and She is responsible for the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; birth, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sustenance and destruction of all beings including Brahma, Vishnu&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and Shiva.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whichever deity you are attached to and worship as your ishta&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; devata, please &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; try to imagine that deity as the all-pervading supreme cosmic &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; being&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom the entire creation evolves.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;&lt;a rel=&quot;nofollow&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; href=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, January 15, 2009 11:44 PM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Question on Istha devata to Narasimhaji&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was reading up on the old mail about how your started doign &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Chandi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Homa. You mentioned that you always considered Ma Lakshmi as you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Istha Devata.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now what I was wondering about it that, is it possible that for &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person to get closer to his/her Istha, he/she may have to under &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; go&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; serious sadhana of some other deity?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Like in your case you have done so many homas for Ma Chandi, so &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; does&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it mean Ma Chandi is your Istha devata?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Or does it mean Ma Lakshmi wanted you to do these sadhanas so &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you can progress faster, maybe you had done a lot of sadhana &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; for Ma&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chandi in previous lives?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly tell us your views on this.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n    &lt;/div&gt;  \n\n\n\t \n\t\n\t&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-1597777914-1233252887=:28265--\r\n\n"}}
