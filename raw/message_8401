Let me narrate the same here.\n\nOn his way to Gangotri, an individual nam=\r\ned &quot;P&quot; reached a small, less-populated village. It was evening and a slight=\r\n drizzle poured on the backdrop of a orange colored setting sun. He was won=\r\ndering where to spend the night, when he suddenly found a Bhairavi standing=\r\n infront of him. He was surprised. Shakti sadhana is not that popular in th=\r\nese parts of India, neither are Tantriks and Bhairavis. She wore a red sari=\r\n, had a jata on her head and a trishul in one hand and small cloth tied int=\r\no a knot in her other hand. She looked about 32-34 years of age and was str=\r\nikingly beautiful looking.\n\nBefore he could\n open his mouth, she started sp=\r\neaking and speaking. First she spoke in Hindi, then Punjabi and then Marath=\r\ni. Because of his travels across India, the author was familiar with the so=\r\nund of different Indian languages but could not understand them. Then she s=\r\npoke in Bengali which was the P&#39;s mother-tongue. &quot;Are you going to Gangotri=\r\n? Have you found a place to stay for the night?&quot;. P was not too pleased see=\r\ning her. He loved his own solitary wanderings and was not keen on company. =\r\nSo to avoid her, he said I have found a place to stay for the night but it =\r\nis extremely dirty, littered with droppings of wild animals and infested wi=\r\nth snakes and scorpions. She insisted that she will be able to manage and i=\r\nt was afterall only a matter of one night to avoid the rains. Once the stay=\r\ning place was reached, she cleaned the place up with a fallen branch from a=\r\n tree, laid out her belongings on one side and lit a fire with some twigs. =\r\nThen she asked him if had any food. P\n replied he did not, plus all the sho=\r\nps in the area were closed due to the inclement weather. She got up and sai=\r\nd she has to take a bath in the Ganges nearby and will come back soon. Afte=\r\nr about half and hour she returned back with a something tied in a cloth. S=\r\nhe opened the cloth and took out 2 rotis and some bhaji and gave it to the =\r\nauthor to eat. The author was mildly surprised and on inquiry was told that=\r\n near the bank of Ganges she had found one small eatery and she got the foo=\r\nd from there. She herself did not eat anything but gave the food to the him=\r\n, saying she was not hungry. P felt grateful for the food and confessed tha=\r\nt he would have gone hungry tonight, had it not been for her, because he di=\r\nd not have money to buy food. \n\nShe asked with surprise, &quot;You have come so =\r\nfar with any money? Where is your home? ETC ETC.&quot; On hearing his answers, s=\r\nhe asked, &quot;So do you believe that your meeting me is due to the will of\n Ja=\r\ngadamba?&quot;. He replied, &quot;Well at least on regarding the food, definitely!&quot;Bh=\r\nairavi, &quot;You people have petty minds, without any gains you don&#39;t listen to=\r\n anything, you don&#39;t interact freely with others&quot;.\nHe asked,&quot; Are you a Tan=\r\ntrik?&quot; She replied, &quot;Yes. What is your bhava?&quot;P, &quot;I do not have fixed path,=\r\n but I am very curious about Tantra and Shakti Sadhana. Can you ask you som=\r\ne questions about Tantra? Can a person attain God through the path of Tantr=\r\na?&quot;\n\nShe sat down crosslegged in padmasana and replied, &quot; The word God mean=\r\ns different things to different people. Then attaining God has even more di=\r\nfferent and complex meanings to everyone based on their own ideas. This is =\r\nnot like attaining some property or money. It can be attained by various pa=\r\nth, and then again it can attained by no-path at all. And the most complex =\r\nthing in all this is what you refer to as God is not\n something that is to =\r\nbe possessed at all! Are you satisfied with the answer?&quot;\nP: &quot;What is the ai=\r\nm of Tantrik sadhanas? What is the tangible benefit? Those who are Tantriks=\r\n or Siddha Kaulacharis, what do they gain?&quot;\nBhairavi, &quot;Whoever does sadhana=\r\n with whatever intention, they will achieve that. But real Tantra-sadhana, =\r\nwhich is vira-chara, is about becoming free from chains (pashas). Only when=\r\n the chains have been broken that divine Shakti is awakened in the body. No=\r\nw if someone then uses this Divine Shakti for personal gains, then they hea=\r\nd towards great calamity. Those who use it for the good of humanity, they b=\r\necome really divine&quot;.\nTill now she was speaking calmly. Now P asked, &quot;But t=\r\nhe answer that you gave seems like a riddle to me. Are you trying to imply =\r\nthat man cannot attain God through Tantra?&quot;\nBhairavi:&quot;If you had been intel=\r\nligent, you would not\n have asked this question. Forget about attaining God=\r\n for the moment, first learn to acquire shakti. Have you done that? Start i=\r\nmmediately and by Bhagawati&#39;s grace you will accomplish. This I can guarant=\r\nee.=C2=A0 First become a Shaktiman, understand what is Shakti and how much =\r\nShakti you are capable of holding in your body and mind. Understood? Don&#39;t =\r\nwaste your time in useless debates. Did you understand what I am saying?&quot;\nT=\r\nhe Bhairavi looked angry, the color of her face has suddenly changed and he=\r\nr eyes become still and unblinking. P felt scared. He kept quite. She conti=\r\nnued:&quot; All these idiots having read a few books here and there have only le=\r\narnt useless debates and time-wasting. Debating on God and shastra. Hah! Sh=\r\naktihin (sans Shakti), medhahin (sans intellect), virjahin (sans ojas), you=\r\n guys get kicked from your bosses in office, and the come home and show off=\r\n your impotency on your wives and mothers. And you want to debate\n on Shakt=\r\ni sadhana! This is ridiculous!&quot;\nP got unnerved and was certain that she is =\r\na mad woman. The moment this thought came in his mind, she stood up at a li=\r\nghtning pace and screamed back, &quot; Oh you think I am mad? You don&#39;t know who=\r\n I am. I can destroy you completely, or I can make you into a real Shaktima=\r\nn. Do you want to see?&quot;\nHis mind became stunned into silence. He did not kn=\r\now what to say. In fear, he looked down at his own feet unable to make any =\r\nconversation and started chanting the name of Krishna to save him. He wonde=\r\nred if he should now get up and run away from that place. Immediate she cam=\r\ne over to where he was sitting and held his shoulders, &quot;Where will you run?=\r\n Do you think you have the ability to escape from me, without my willing it=\r\n? I consider people like you nothing more than insects. You&#39;ve left your wi=\r\nfe and son and gone out roaming to peform Dharma! You don&#39;t even know what =\r\nDharma\n means. An idiot of the first order. People like you are sheep, not =\r\nmen. Escapists and cowards. Throw away all your bookish adwaitha into the G=\r\nanges. It&#39;s nonsense. Either do you know what is bhoga, nor do you know wha=\r\nt is yoga, running away from life and believing that by escaping one attain=\r\ns to renunciation. No passion for life, no passion for God. Dead decayed in=\r\ndividuals. A sheep whose only contribution to life is to reproduce some mor=\r\ne sheep and then run away from them. Idiot!&quot;\nIn fear and shame the P felt l=\r\nike he would faint any moment. For the first time in his wanderings he felt=\r\n so depressed about himself that he did not know what to say. Like in a tra=\r\nnce he felt his \nvision was becoming dark and blurry. He was about to fall =\r\ndown on the floor, when the Bhairavi shook him violently, holding his shoul=\r\nders and said, &quot;There is no renunciation or detachment from life in your he=\r\nart and mind. How dare you argue and\n dabble in Yoga. Your prarabdha awaits=\r\n you and you think you can escape? Look at yourself and speak honestly. Are=\r\n you free from desires of life? Tell me the truth, for I can see through yo=\r\nu&quot;. He could not lift his eyes from his feet and look at her. He felt asham=\r\ned of himself and in a feeling of overwhelming sadness, he touched her feet=\r\n and started crying, &quot;Ma please save me.=C2=A0 You are right. I am an idiot=\r\n, I am a coward, I am an escapist. And I have run away leaving my wife and =\r\nchildren at home. I am weak of mind and heart.&quot; His voice became choked wit=\r\nh tears.\nHearing this the Bhairavi became silent. She held his chin with he=\r\nr right-hand and lifted up his face to the light. Her eyes had changed colo=\r\nr and there was a tremendous compassion on her face. &quot;What do you think I a=\r\nm? An evil spirit, a pisachi descended from hell to torment you, a raving m=\r\nad woman?&quot;\n\nAnd P replied, &quot;But I have not said\n anything to you like that,=\r\n have I?&quot;. Hearing this she became furious with anger, &quot;Will you people nev=\r\ner become real men? You think something in your heart and you lie through y=\r\nour teeth when asked. Don&#39;t you have any tej, shakti anything at all? Lying=\r\n to escape situations? Is this the character of real purush? Soft like mud =\r\nwho can be molded into any obnoxious character when challenged by situation=\r\ns? And you think you can learn vira-bhava of Bhairava? Fool! What do you do=\r\n in life?&quot;\nP replied he was a painter before he left home. Hearing this her=\r\n eyes widened in a childlike excitement. She lost her anger completely and =\r\nasked,&quot; Can you draw me a picture? I have been searching for a good artist?=\r\n Can you draw a picture of Chinnamasta? I&#39;ve not found anyone who can draw =\r\nher properly&quot;.\nP, &quot;Printed pictures of Chinnamasta are easily available in =\r\nthe market for a very little price&quot;. Hearing this she started\n roaring with=\r\n laughter, &quot;Printed in the markets you say? Hah! Chinnamasta? \nHave you gon=\r\ne mad? &lt;again laughter&gt;.&quot;\nP, &quot;I find her image very violent and terrifying&quot;=\r\n.\nThen the Bhairavi spoke in a voice so loud that it sounded like a humkar,=\r\n &quot;Fool! For people like you who are worst than women, it is but natural tha=\r\nt Chinnamasta will look scary and terrifying. People who are scared at the =\r\nfirst sight of blood and death will not appreciate her beauty! Those who re=\r\nmain trapped in conditioned thinking of pap vs punya, sarga vs naraka, good=\r\n vs bad, and other dualities cannot understand the madness of Chinnamasta. =\r\nYou will only be able to draw a white Saraswati with her beena and live try=\r\ning to deny the other aspects and realities of life, the death and the deca=\r\ny and never see the grand play of the Universe. For you and your ilk, a wom=\r\nan is an object of subconscious revulsion, you run scared\n when you see the=\r\n first woman approaching, you run away from your own wife, how on earth can=\r\n you handle the terrible beauty of Chinnamasta?&quot;\nThen she pushed him with h=\r\ner hand. He fell on the floor. She continued, &quot;Go drown yourself in the Gan=\r\nges and before doing so pray to Jagadamba Durga that She may make you fit t=\r\no hold shakti in your next life. Or at least beg Her, implore Her, that She=\r\n may grant you intelligence to understand what is Shakti-tattwa.&quot;\nHearing t=\r\nhese words, P was so depressed that his mind plunged into chaos and darknes=\r\ns. Like in a state of debilitating trance, he got up from the floor and sat=\r\n down. The Bhairavi was not there in the room. He looked all around him. Th=\r\nen he saw her on the road outside, walking towards the ganges. He cried out=\r\n to her, &quot;Don&#39;t leave me here, I must know who you are. I am confused about=\r\n life and everything else&quot;. As soon as he uttered these words, the room\n st=\r\narted reverberating with a attahasa, though there was not a soul present th=\r\nere apart from him. A laughter so loud that he left his ear drums will spli=\r\nt. He rushed out into the rain to follow the moving figure of the Bhairavi.=\r\n The faster he ran, the more did the distance keep increasing between him a=\r\nnd the Bhairavi. Then he could see clearly, the Bhairavi entering into the =\r\nGanges water, and kept moving deeper until she was drowned completely in th=\r\ne water. The author sat near the banks, shouting out to her, asking her to =\r\ncome out and help him. But there was no response. Just the regular lapping =\r\nsound of waves hitting the shore and a very dark night. \n\nHe sat there till=\r\n sunrise, transfixed by the bank of the Ganges. Next morning he went and as=\r\nked around the village, but no one had seen the Bhairavi and neither was th=\r\nere any shop near the banks which sold food. Because of the heavy rains, ev=\r\nerything was shut down last night\n with not a soul in the open.\n\nYears late=\r\nr, P went back home to his wife and son and lead a full and complete family=\r\n life. I have merely narrated the incident as it is.\n\n-Regards=C2=A0Rajarsh=\r\ni\n\n\nBazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mer=\r\ne aage=C2=A0Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeekEk baat hain ijaz-e-=\r\nmasiah mere aage.\n        From: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt;\n=\r\n To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n Sent: =\r\nSunday, 17 June 2012 5:51 PM\n Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karmic liabil=\r\nity and Personal Grace of Sri Mahavidya&quot;\n   \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n    \n=\r\n      \n      \n      \n\n\nHello, \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 This letter is to cheer you up and it is=C2=A0a strange =\r\nbut true personal experience.\nDivine Mother cares and protects her children=\r\n all the time and also plays snakes and ladders and ludo with them.

Her Appearence Day Tithi has just gone by few weeks ag=\r\no.\n=C2=A0\nMany years ago when I was living in Brajbhoomi, a sadhu came one =\r\nlate evening to my ashram. After some time he took me to a quite corner and=\r\n told me certain thing about follwing year. As the Sadhu had a glow on his =\r\nface and had certain powers about him I believed him. Later on he also gave=\r\n me a Mantra of=C2=A0Sri Hanumanji which I still do. That sadhu left in the=\r\n morning and I never saw him again. Somehow the things he told me did not h=\r\nappen and this tithi became very upsetting for me.\n=C2=A0\nSome years back h=\r\nere in London I was coming home in the afternoon. I was in a crowded bus an=\r\nd holding on to railings.Suddenly I rememberd that it was Tithi of Bhagvati=\r\n Sri Chinnmastaji. I started to recite Her mantra&#92;name and try to meditate =\r\non Her in that crowded bus. I even smiled myself on the strangeness of that=\r\n situation. After few more minutes I reached home and opened my front door =\r\nand went inside. After going through my Puja room and telling my mother tha=\r\nt I was back, I flopped on sofa in front room which is very near to front g=\r\nate. Then I heard some noises but I did not get up and slept for nearly one=\r\n hour. After I got up I got a srrong feeling to open my front door although=\r\n nobody had knocked. The whole area in front of my house was covered in Pol=\r\nice lines and tapes. I could not believe it. \n=C2=A0\nI asked a policeman wh=\r\no was near my door and he said that Turkish gunmen were shooting at each ot=\r\nher and then they ran away.I felt ashiver im body. On that day I was clearl=\r\ny saved by Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. She came in my inner sky several minu=\r\ntes before the incident and I started Her prayers although there was no rea=\r\nsons for me to do so.

Some stud=\r\nents don&#39;t listen when explained gently, some students listen only when the=\r\n teacher yells so no offences should be taken by anyone.=C2=A0 \n\n\n\nAnother =\r\nthing I always noticed is that for some reason most of them in this forum t=\r\nalk with great respect to Narsimha ji and don&#39;t even consider taking advice=\r\ns given by any other devotees. We all know Narsimha ji but we don&#39;t know wh=\r\nich other high raised souls we are talking to. Please talk with respect and=\r\n consideration towards other devotees also otherwise our prayers are a comp=\r\nlete waste....\n\nRegards,\nPriya Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n\n\n \n\n\nYour ema=\r\nil settings: Individual Email|Traditional \nChange settings via the Web (Yah=\r\noo!

Let me narrate the same he=\r\nre.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;On his way to Gangotri=\r\n, an individual named &quot;P&quot; reached a small, less-populated village. It was e=\r\nvening and a slight drizzle poured on the backdrop of a orange colored sett=\r\ning sun. He was wondering where to spend the night, when he suddenly found =\r\na Bhairavi standing infront of him. He was surprised. Shakti sadhana is not=\r\n that popular in these parts of India, neither are Tantriks and Bhairavis. =\r\nShe wore a red sari, had a jata on her head and a trishul in one hand and s=\r\nmall cloth tied into a knot in her other hand. She looked about 32-34 years=\r\n of age and was strikingly beautiful looking.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\nBefore he could\n open his mouth, she started speaking and speaking. First s=\r\nhe spoke in Hindi, then Punjabi and then Marathi. Because of his travels ac=\r\nross India, the author was familiar with the sound of different Indian lang=\r\nuages but could not understand them. Then she spoke in Bengali which was th=\r\ne P&#39;s mother-tongue. &quot;Are you going to Gangotri? Have you found a place to =\r\nstay for the night?&quot;. P was not too pleased seeing her. He loved his own so=\r\nlitary wanderings and was not keen on company. So to avoid her, he said I h=\r\nave found a place to stay for the night but it is extremely dirty, littered=\r\n with droppings of wild animals and infested with snakes and scorpions. She=\r\n insisted that she will be able to manage and it was afterall only a matter=\r\n of one night to avoid the rains. Once the staying place was reached, she c=\r\nleaned the place up with a fallen branch from a tree, laid out her belongin=\r\ngs on one side and lit a fire with some twigs. Then she asked him if had an=\r\ny food. P\n replied he did not, plus all the shops in the area were closed d=\r\nue to the inclement weather. She got up and said she has to take a bath in =\r\nthe Ganges nearby and will come back soon. After about half and hour she re=\r\nturned back with a something tied in a cloth. She opened the cloth and took=\r\n out 2 rotis and some bhaji and gave it to the author to eat. The author wa=\r\ns mildly surprised and on inquiry was told that near the bank of Ganges she=\r\n had found one small eatery and she got the food from there. She herself di=\r\nd not eat anything but gave the food to the him, saying she was not hungry.=\r\n P felt grateful for the food and confessed that he would have gone hungry =\r\ntonight, had it not been for her, because he did not have money to buy food=\r\n. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She asked with surprise, &quot;You have come so =\r\nfar with any money? Where is your home? ETC ETC.&quot; On hearing his answers, s=\r\nhe asked, &quot;So do you believe that your meeting me is due to the will of\n Ja=\r\ngadamba?&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt; He replied, &quot;Well at least on regarding the food, def=\r\ninitely!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bhairavi, &quot;You people have petty minds, without any gai=\r\nns you don&#39;t listen to anything, you don&#39;t interact freely with others&quot;.&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;He asked,&quot; Are you a Tantrik?&quot; She replied, &quot;Yes. Wh=\r\nat is your bhava?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P, &quot;I do not have fixed path, but I am very cu=\r\nrious about Tantra and Shakti Sadhana. Can you ask you some questions about=\r\n Tantra? Can a person attain God through the path of Tantra?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;She sat down crosslegged in padmasana and replied, &quot; The wo=\r\nrd God means different things to different people. Then attaining God has e=\r\nven more different and complex meanings to everyone based on their own idea=\r\ns. This is not like attaining some property or money. It can be attained by=\r\n various path, and then again it can attained by no-path at all. And the mo=\r\nst complex thing in all this is what you refer to as God is not\n something =\r\nthat is to be possessed at all! Are you satisfied with the answer?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P: &quot;What is the aim of Tantrik sadhanas? What is the tang=\r\nible benefit? Those who are Tantriks or Siddha Kaulacharis, what do they ga=\r\nin?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Bhairavi, &quot;Whoever does sadhana with whatever=\r\n intention, they will achieve that. But real Tantra-sadhana, which is vira-=\r\nchara, is about becoming free from chains (pashas). Only when the chains ha=\r\nve been broken that divine Shakti is awakened in the body. Now if someone t=\r\nhen uses this Divine Shakti for personal gains, then they head towards grea=\r\nt calamity. Those who use it for the good of humanity, they become really d=\r\nivine&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Till now she was speaking calmly. Now P as=\r\nked, &quot;But the answer that you gave seems like a riddle to me. Are you tryin=\r\ng to imply that man cannot attain God through Tantra?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;Bhairavi:&quot;If you had been intelligent, you would not\n have asked this =\r\nquestion. Forget about attaining God for the moment, first learn to acquire=\r\n shakti. Have you done that? Start immediately and by Bhagawati&#39;s grace you=\r\n will accomplish. This I can guarantee.&nbsp; First become a Shaktiman, und=\r\nerstand what is Shakti and how much Shakti you are capable of holding in yo=\r\nur body and mind. Understood? Don&#39;t waste your time in useless debates. Did=\r\n you understand what I am saying?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Bhairavi lo=\r\noked angry, the color of her face has suddenly changed and her eyes become =\r\nstill and unblinking. P felt scared. He kept quite. She continued:&quot; All the=\r\nse idiots having read a few books here and there have only learnt useless d=\r\nebates and time-wasting. Debating on God and shastra. Hah! Shaktihin (sans =\r\nShakti), medhahin (sans intellect), virjahin (sans ojas), you guys get kick=\r\ned from your bosses in office, and the come home and show off your impotenc=\r\ny on your wives and mothers. And you want to debate\n on Shakti sadhana! Thi=\r\ns is ridiculous!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P got unnerved and was certain t=\r\nhat she is a mad woman. The moment this thought came in his mind, she stood=\r\n up at a lightning pace and screamed back, &quot; Oh you think I am mad? You don=\r\n&#39;t know who I am. I can destroy you completely, or I can make you into a re=\r\nal Shaktiman. Do you want to see?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;His mind became=\r\n stunned into silence. He did not know what to say. In fear, he looked down=\r\n at his own feet unable to make any conversation and started chanting the n=\r\name of Krishna to save him. He wondered if he should now get up and run awa=\r\ny from that place. Immediate she came over to where he was sitting and held=\r\n his shoulders, &quot;Where will you run? Do you think you have the ability to e=\r\nscape from me, without my willing it? I consider people like you nothing mo=\r\nre than insects. You&#39;ve left your wife and son and gone out roaming to pefo=\r\nrm Dharma! You don&#39;t even know what Dharma\n means. An idiot of the first or=\r\nder. People like you are sheep, not men. Escapists and cowards. Throw away =\r\nall your bookish adwaitha into the Ganges. It&#39;s nonsense. Either do you kno=\r\nw what is bhoga, nor do you know what is yoga, running away from life and b=\r\nelieving that by escaping one attains to renunciation. No passion for life,=\r\n no passion for God. Dead decayed individuals. A sheep whose only contribut=\r\nion to life is to reproduce some more sheep and then run away from them. Id=\r\niot!&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In fear and shame the P felt like he would f=\r\naint any moment. For the first time in his wanderings he felt so depressed =\r\nabout himself that he did not know what to say. Like in a trance he felt hi=\r\ns &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;vision was becoming dark and blurry. He was about to fall =\r\ndown on the floor, when the Bhairavi shook him violently, holding his shoul=\r\nders and said, &quot;There is no renunciation or detachment from life in your he=\r\nart and mind. How dare you argue and\n dabble in Yoga. Your prarabdha awaits=\r\n you and you think you can escape? Look at yourself and speak honestly. Are=\r\n you free from desires of life? Tell me the truth, for I can see through yo=\r\nu&quot;. He could not lift his eyes from his feet and look at her. He felt asham=\r\ned of himself and in a feeling of overwhelming sadness, he touched her feet=\r\n and started crying, &quot;Ma please save me.&nbsp; You are right. I am an idiot=\r\n, I am a coward, I am an escapist. And I have run away leaving my wife and =\r\nchildren at home. I am weak of mind and heart.&quot; His voice became choked wit=\r\nh tears.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hearing this the Bhairavi became silent. =\r\nShe held his chin with her right-hand and lifted up his face to the light. =\r\nHer eyes had changed color and there was a tremendous compassion on her fac=\r\ne. &quot;What do you think I am? An evil spirit, a pisachi descended from hell t=\r\no torment you, a raving mad woman?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;And P repl=\r\nied, &quot;But I have not said\n anything to you like that, have I?&quot;. Hearing thi=\r\ns she became furious with anger, &quot;Will you people never become real men? Yo=\r\nu think something in your heart and you lie through your teeth when asked. =\r\nDon&#39;t you have any tej, shakti anything at all? Lying to escape situations?=\r\n Is this the character of real purush? Soft like mud who can be molded into=\r\n any obnoxious character when challenged by situations? And you think you c=\r\nan learn vira-bhava of Bhairava? Fool! What do you do in life?&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P replied he was a painter before he left home. Hearing this =\r\nher eyes widened in a childlike excitement. She lost her anger completely a=\r\nnd asked,&quot; Can you draw me a picture? I have been searching for a good arti=\r\nst? Can you draw a picture of Chinnamasta? I&#39;ve not found anyone who can dr=\r\naw her properly&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P, &quot;Printed pictures of Chinnama=\r\nsta are easily available in the market for a very little price&quot;. Hearing th=\r\nis she started\n roaring with laughter, &quot;Printed in the markets you say? Hah=\r\n! Chinnamasta? &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Have you gone mad? &lt;again laughter&gt;.&quot;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;P, &quot;I find her image very violent and terrifying&quot;.&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then the Bhairavi spoke in a voice so loud that it=\r\n sounded like a humkar, &quot;Fool! For people like you who are worst than women=\r\n, it is but natural that Chinnamasta will look scary and terrifying. People=\r\n who are scared at the first sight of blood and death will not appreciate h=\r\ner beauty! Those who remain trapped in conditioned thinking of pap vs punya=\r\n, sarga vs naraka, good vs bad, and other dualities cannot understand the m=\r\nadness of Chinnamasta. You will only be able to draw a white Saraswati with=\r\n her beena and live trying to deny the other aspects and realities of life,=\r\n the death and the decay and never see the grand play of the Universe. For =\r\nyou and your ilk, a woman is an object of subconscious revulsion, you run s=\r\ncared\n when you see the first woman approaching, you run away from your own=\r\n wife, how on earth can you handle the terrible beauty of Chinnamasta?&quot;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Then she pushed him with her hand. He fell on the flo=\r\nor. She continued, &quot;Go drown yourself in the Ganges and before doing so pra=\r\ny to Jagadamba Durga that She may make you fit to hold shakti in your next =\r\nlife. Or at least beg Her, implore Her, that She may grant you intelligence=\r\n to understand what is Shakti-tattwa.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hearing the=\r\nse words, P was so depressed that his mind plunged into chaos and darkness.=\r\n Like in a state of debilitating trance, he got up from the floor and sat d=\r\nown. The Bhairavi was not there in the room. He looked all around him. Then=\r\n he saw her on the road outside, walking towards the ganges. He cried out t=\r\no her, &quot;Don&#39;t leave me here, I must know who you are. I am confused about l=\r\nife and everything else&quot;. As soon as he uttered these words, the room\n star=\r\nted reverberating with a attahasa, though there was not a soul present ther=\r\ne apart from him. A laughter so loud that he left his ear drums will split.=\r\n He rushed out into the rain to follow the moving figure of the Bhairavi. T=\r\nhe faster he ran, the more did the distance keep increasing between him and=\r\n the Bhairavi. Then he could see clearly, the Bhairavi entering into the Ga=\r\nnges water, and kept moving deeper until she was drowned completely in the =\r\nwater. The author sat near the banks, shouting out to her, asking her to co=\r\nme out and help him. But there was no response. Just the regular lapping so=\r\nund of waves hitting the shore and a very dark night. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;He sat there till sunrise, transfixed by the bank of the Ganges. N=\r\next morning he went and asked around the village, but no one had seen the B=\r\nhairavi and neither was there any shop near the banks which sold food. Beca=\r\nuse of the heavy rains, everything was shut down last night\n with not a sou=\r\nl in the open.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Years later, P went =\r\nback home to his wife and son and lead a full and complete family life. I h=\r\nave merely narrated the incident as it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Re=\r\ngards&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv369550851MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv3=\r\n69550851yui_3_2_0_109_133999228119169&quot;

After some time he took me to a quite corner and to=\r\nld me certain thing about follwing year. As the Sadhu had a glow on his fac=\r\ne and had certain powers about him I believed him. Later on he also gave me=\r\n a Mantra of&nbsp;Sri Hanumanji which I still do. That sadhu left in the mo=\r\nrning and I never saw him again. Somehow the things he told me did not happ=\r\nen and this tithi became very upsetting for me.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Some years back here in London I was coming hom=\r\ne in the afternoon. I was in a crowded bus and holding on to railings.Sudde=\r\nnly I rememberd that it was Tithi of Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. I started t=\r\no recite Her mantra&#92;name and try to meditate on Her in that crowded bus. I =\r\neven smiled myself on the strangeness of that situation. After few more min=\r\nutes I reached home and opened my front door and went inside. After going t=\r\nhrough my Puja room and telling my mother that I was back, I flopped on sof=\r\na in front room which is very near to front gate. Then I heard some noises =\r\nbut I did not get up and slept for nearly one hour. After I got up I got a =\r\nsrrong feeling to open my front door although nobody had knocked. The whole=\r\n area in front of my house was covered in Police lines and tapes. I could n=\r\not believe it. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;I as=\r\nked a policeman who was near my door and he said that Turkish gunmen were s=\r\nhooting at each other and then they ran away.I felt ashiver im body. On tha=\r\nt day I was clearly saved by Bhagvati Sri Chinnmastaji. She came in my inne=\r\nr sky several minutes before the incident and I started Her prayers althoug=\r\nh there was no reasons for me to do so. Then I slept whole time without kno=\r\nwing a single thing as load of armed policemen were there after those gunma=\r\nn.and whole noises and drama.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;What else is this but=\r\n Personal Grace of Bhagvati Sri&nbsp;Chinnmastaji&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;GoodLuck&nbsp; and Thanks&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan&gt;LaxmiNarayan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bol=\r\nd;&quot;&gt;rom:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nFONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, 16 June 2012, 2:48&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bol=\r\nd;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Karmic liability for Tantra =\r\n&quot;material sadhana&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvet=\r\nica, sans-serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv369550851yui_3_2_0_18_13399246893=\r\n7247&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times, serif;FO=\r\nNT-SIZE:12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv369550851&quot;&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D=\r\n&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR:#fff;FONT-FAMILY:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;COLOR:#000;=\r\nFONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Namaste &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Aparna ji, a&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; few of us whom you consider a=\r\nre blessed with the desire to pray her may definitely feel bad to read your=\r\n mail.
