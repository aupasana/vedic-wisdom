This unique conception has not been replicated by any other reli=\r\ngion on earth, and is exclusive to Sanatana Dharma. Thus to even call this =\r\nconception of Brahman &#39;God&#39; is, in a sense, somewhat imprecise. This is the=\r\n case because Brahman does not refer to the anthropomorphic concept of God =\r\nof the Abrahamic religions.
