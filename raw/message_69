Such vehicles of worship and \nm=\r\neditation have included divine images, sacred relics of saints, and \nhallow=\r\ned objects of many descriptions.  The use of images as  a path \nthrough whi=\r\nch finite humanity can approach the Infinite has been \nfound in every tradi=\r\ntional culture, religion, and nation on earth.  \nThe use of images as a way=\r\n to know the Divine has been the \noverwhelming norm =96 and not the excepti=\r\non =96 in the history of the \nworld&#39;s many religions.  \n \nThe almost sole e=\r\nxception to this means of approaching God has \noccurred in the relatively r=\r\necent religions of the Western world.  \nFor the majority of adherents of th=\r\ne Abrahamic sects (Judaism, \nChristianity, and Islam), the use of images as=\r\n tools for meditation \nand prayer has been looked upon as a taboo religious=\r\n activity.  Many \nWestern religions consequently oppose the practice of wha=\r\nt they \nterm &quot;idol&quot; worship.  The leaders of these Abrahamic sects have \nre=\r\npeatedly condemned worshipers who employ images of divine figures \nas &quot;Devi=\r\nl worshipers&quot;, &quot;idolaters&quot;, &quot;heathens&quot; and &quot;infidels&quot;, among \nother unchari=\r\ntable descriptions.  Those who use icons as a means of \nworship have faced =\r\npersecution, denunciation, and even death at the \nhands of such &quot;idol&quot; smas=\r\nhers.  But is the conscious use of sacred \nimagery in worship and meditatio=\r\nn really to be considered &quot;idol \nworship&quot; and consequently condemned?  Foll=\r\nowers of Sanatana Dharma \nare known to use sacred images as focal points fo=\r\nr meditation and \nworship, and have suffered significant persecution as a r=\r\nesult.  Are \nHindus actually idol worshipers?  \n \nThe concept of an &quot;idol&quot; =\r\ndoes not refer merely to any iconographic \nimage that is used in worship.  =\r\nRather the term &quot;idol&quot; refers \nspecifically to an image that is made up, co=\r\nncocted in the mind of \nits maker, and then claimed to be a divinity.  An i=\r\ndol in the proper \nsense of the term refers to something that one worships =\r\nas a result \nof his or her own whim, and not as a result of the teachings o=\r\nf \nsacred scriptures. \n \nThis, however, is not what Hindus are doing when w=\r\ne venerate sacred \nimages.  Hindus are not idol worshipers because the imag=\r\nes that we \nemploy in worship are not contrived by humans.  \n \nRather than =\r\n&quot;idols&quot;, Hindus worship what are properly \ncalled &quot;Murtis&quot;.  Murti worship =\r\nis a divine science revealed to \nhumanity in order to facilitate our closen=\r\ness to God.  Sacred Hindu \nimages are not the fanciful creations of the hum=\r\nan imagination.  \nRather, such sacred images were revealed to Hindu worship=\r\ners by sages \n(Rishis) who have directly experienced the nature of the Divi=\r\nne.  To \nuse objects as a focus for devotional prayer and contemplation is =\r\n\nperfectly fine, as long as these images are God-revealed.\n \nThe science of=\r\n employing divine imagery is found in sacred revealed \ntexts known as the A=\r\ngamas and Pancaratras.  In these texts, the \nentire science of image venera=\r\ntion is laid out in a logical and \nreasonable manner.  For example there ar=\r\ne very exacting \nspecifications for precisely how such images must be creat=\r\ned, \nincluding the exact dimensions of the images, the rituals necessary \nt=\r\no create them, and what sacred mantras must be recited during the \nprocess.=\r\n  Indeed, even the exact size of every toe has to be \naccording to certain =\r\nstrict specifications.  Only when these images \nare in accord with these ex=\r\nact specifications do they then become \nvehicles of the Divine, and proper =\r\nobjects of veneration and \nmeditation.\n \nIn following these exact requireme=\r\nnts of the sacred texts of Sanatana \nDharma the worshiper is performing a v=\r\nery special sacred process \nknown as Murti worship, which is categorically =\r\ndistinct from &quot;idol&quot; \nworship.  \n \nThe term &quot;idol&quot; is a clearly derogatory =\r\nterm used by unthinking \nfollowers of anti-Hindu religions to persecute and=\r\n revile the \nprofound spiritual tradition of Sanatana Dharma.  In the same =\r\nway \nthat other derogatory terms have been removed from civilized human \ndi=\r\nscourse, the term &quot;idol&quot; must never be used again by either Hindus \nor non-=\r\nHindus to refer to the sublime science of Murti worship.  \n \nIndeed, even H=\r\nindus themselves have often been guilty of using the \nterm &quot;idol&quot; in ignora=\r\nnce of the nature of their own religion.  \nWhether the term is used by eith=\r\ner Hindus or non-Hindus, the use of \nthe term &quot;idol&quot; to refer to our sacred=\r\n imagery must be immediately \nstopped.  Rather we must begin to use such pr=\r\noper Sanskrit terms as \nMurti, Archa, etc. when referring to our sacred ima=\r\ngery.  \n \nOur own ignorance of our own religion is just as inexcusable as i=\r\ns a \nnon-Hindu&#39;s ignorance of our religion.  Let us take pride in the \ndivi=\r\nne gift that the Rishis have bestowed upon us in the form of \nMurti worship=\r\n.  \n\n \n \nThe Author:\n\nDr. Frank Morales, Ph.D. (Sri Dharma Pravartaka Achar=\r\nya) is an \nAmerican who has been practicing Sanatana Dharma for over 30 yea=\r\nrs. \nHe has a Ph.D. in Religious Studies and is recognized by the global \nH=\r\nindu community as one of the leading Hindu Acharyas (Spiritual \nPreceptors)=\r\n in the nation.

I w=\r\nould truly appreciate ANY help.  My husband is \nnot, and will not, become v=\r\negetarian along with me, so this too will \nbe a hurdle to overcome.  I very=\r\n much enjoy reading your blogs.  I \nhave found them to be very helpful.  Yo=\r\nur wisdom is invaluable.\n \nHari Om,&quot;\n \n                                   -=\r\n Pam\n\n---------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n----\n\nSri Acharya Ji&#39;s Response: \n\nDear Pam,\n \nNamaste.  Thank you for yo=\r\nur kind message.  It&#39;s great meeting you.\n \nI&#39;m sorry to hear about the pro=\r\nblems you&#39;re having becoming \nvegetarian.  The difficulty definitely varies=\r\n from person to person.  \n \nI became vegetarian when I was first twelve, an=\r\nd was living in a \nfamily of very dedicated meat-eaters.  One thing that I =\r\nfound helpful \nwhen I first became vegetarian was to try to do it a little =\r\nat a \ntime.  It took me about a year before I was a full vegetarian.  \n \nFi=\r\nrst I gave up all red meats - beef, pork, etc.  Then after some \ntime, I ga=\r\nve up on the lighter meats like chicken and turkey.  A few \nmonths after th=\r\nat, I then stopped eating fish.  Lastly I gave up on \neggs as well.  \n \nAga=\r\nin, it took roughly a year by the time I entered the last stage.  \nIn this =\r\nway, the transition was much easier, and each stage gave my \nbody and mind =\r\ntime to get adjusted to giving up something they had \nbeen accustomed to ha=\r\nving for so long.  I would suggest that you try \na similar approach.  \n \nIn=\r\n addition, it is very helpful to do as much reading on the benefits \nof veg=\r\netarianism as possible in order to keep inspired about why \nyou&#39;re giving u=\r\np meat to begin with.  Half the battle is mental!\n \nAs for your husband not=\r\n wanting to join you in becoming vegetarian, \nI&#39;m sure that definitely is a=\r\nn added stresser for you.  I would very \npatiently and subtilely just conti=\r\nnue to speak to him about the many \nbenefits of a vegetarian diet in a way =\r\nthat he would most \nappreciate.  Is he health conscious?  Then stress the h=\r\nealthy \nbenefits of the diet.  \n \nThe important thing is to not put too muc=\r\nh pressure on him, because \nespecially with family members, that can someti=\r\nmes backfire.  No one \nlikes to feel as if their spouse is preaching to the=\r\nm.  And the \nnormal reaction is often to push back.  Rather, you want to be=\r\n as \nloving and patient with him as possible, always just gently \nsuggestin=\r\ng, and never insisting.  \n \nIn addition, often a spouse will eventually bec=\r\nome vegetarian simply \nby seeing their partner&#39;s own quiet example, and obs=\r\nerving how their \nvegetarian partner is slowly becoming healthier, more ene=\r\nrgetic, and \nhappier as a result of their choice to become vegetarian.  Oft=\r\nen this \nalone is enough to encourage them.  \n \nDon&#39;t give up on your choic=\r\ne, Pam.  Vegetarianism is the most \nintelligent, healthy, and beneficial di=\r\net a person can follow.  In \ntime, God Himself will give you the strength t=\r\no follow this path.  I \nhope this was a helpful.  Take care.\n \nOm Shanti,\n =\r\n\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya\n\n___________________________________________=\r\n_____________________\n\n\nFor further information on the philosophy and path =\r\nof Dharma, please \nvisit us on the web:\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com\n\nhttp=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/yoga-spirituality/\n\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/drmoraleslist/\n\nhttp://www.cafepress.com/supportstore \n\nhttp://www.drfrank=\r\nmorales.sulekha.com\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com/Store/Shakti_Principle.ht=\r\nm\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/profile?user=3DDharmaNation\n\nhttp://www.myspace.c=\r\nom/dharmapravartaka\n\nhttp://dharmanation.blogspot.com/\n\n\nThank you to all o=\r\nur many members and readers for your enthusiastic \nsupport and encouragemen=\r\nt of Dharma Journal and the teaching efforts \nof Dr. Frank Morales.
