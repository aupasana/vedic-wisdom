But in fa=\r\nct, even God cannot \ncreate a thousand Vivekanandas, because such an act wi=\r\nll destroy the very plan \nof God in making the world and its time cycles. G=\r\nod sent Narendra and not sand \nto Paramhamsa. \n\n\nA real Guru knows who is f=\r\nit for what. I have seen some hamsas and paramhamsas \nhelping sinners and r=\r\neforming them to such an extent that lecherous and arrogant \npersons became=\r\n pious and even monks. But at the same time, many persons near and \ndear to=\r\n those gurus, who were neither lecherous nor arrogant, could not gain \nanyt=\r\nhing worthwhile from same gurus. Strange are the ways of God and Guru, but =\r\n\ntrue disciples are no less strange. Only a Guru knows how to tap the hidde=\r\nn \npotential of a disciple. But every disciple does not possess same potent=\r\nial.\n\nNo paramhamsa says that this world is unfit for his service. I am not=\r\n a \nparamhamsa, and I feel I can say so for Paramhamsas on account of what =\r\nI have \nseen. Paramhamsas do not complain, because they are above such thin=\r\ngs. But \nothers like me feel the pain. \n\n\nI sold my ancestral home for help=\r\ning some Sanskrit institutions, and instead of \nhelping I soon found that t=\r\nhe entire society wanted nothing but my money, \nwithout even caring for whe=\r\nther that money will be used for education or not. \nAll my life I worked fo=\r\nr society, and later I found that it was my Lokaishanaa \nwhich was behind m=\r\ny zeal for the good of society. Desire is hard to kill. It \nsublimates into=\r\n seemingly benign forms.\n\nThe real power to help others comes not from soci=\r\no-economic or political power, \nbut from real spiritual Knowledge combined =\r\nwith the inner Shakti of a pure soul. \nThose who possess this power can hel=\r\np others from caves. Once, a great sadhu \nsaved me from sure death by warni=\r\nng telepathically from a distance of many \nmiles. All the real sadhus I kno=\r\nw keep away from limelight as well as from \nhumdrum of society, yet all the=\r\n hamsas or paramhamsas among them help others \nwithout any reward.\n\nChandra=\r\ngupta was lucky to find a great guru. But Chanakya was also lucky to find \n=\r\na great disciple. Such disciples cannot be created at will. The real war be=\r\ntween \ndisciples of Chanakya and Aristotle (Ari+stotra =3D praiser of demon=\r\ns, asuras) has \nnot been properly described by historians. Had Alexander co=\r\nnquered India, we \nwould have lost our culture, history and identity.\n\nTher=\r\ne is no dearth of Chanakyas. They will come out of caves when the need \nari=\r\nses. And the need will soon arise. Centre of gravity of Western world is no=\r\nw \nturning backwards, from North America to Estern Europe and then to Greec=\r\ne-Egypt \n&c. And in the East, from Japan to China and then to India. First =\r\ncasualty of \nthis sea change will be Christianity, at the hands of Islamic =\r\nfundamentalists. \nIt will be accompanied with superpower status of India. I=\r\nt will call many \nChanakyas and Chandraguptas. SOON !\n\nI do not want to mea=\r\nsure the heights or depths of hamsas and paramhamsas. They \nare all great, =\r\nand that is all we need.\n\nI do not see any essential difference with you at=\r\n any point, except in usage of \ncertain words.\nIt is a minor linguistic pro=\r\nblem.\n\nRohiniranjan is not an atheist. He is a bhakt of MAA, and of Ganapat=\r\ni Ji too. He \nis rather imaginative and wants rebooting into a new awakenin=\r\ng, into new \nconsciousness perhaps, bored with old religions. Perhaps his p=\r\nersonal experience \nof men of religion is not happy. But he never found a G=\r\nuru, as far as I know, \nand he does not know the loss. Without a real Guru,=\r\n religion is farce or at best \na dead set of meaningless rituals. Guru impa=\r\nrts true meanings to our existence \nas well as to everything else.\n\n-VJ\n=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D =3D\n--- In vedic-astrology@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Vinay ji,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Use of the term &quot;mental assylums&quot;, with &quot;ass-&quot; in asylum,\n&gt; &gt; reveals t=\r\nhe mindset of a sick society, which will not\n&gt; &gt; allow paramhamsa sadhus to=\r\n live peacefully in society,\n&gt; &gt; and will abuse them if they seek solitude.=\r\n That is why\n&gt; &gt; I said in a recent post that the world does not deserve\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; the service of paramhamsas now.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am afraid our understanding of the=\r\n word &quot;paramahamsa&quot; is not the same..\n&gt; \n&gt; Swan is supposed to able to remo=\r\nve water from milk. Similarly, a paramahamsa \n&gt;(absolute swan) is one who c=\r\nan extract out the bad in a person and leave him \n&gt;with the good that is al=\r\nready in him. In other words, a paramahamsa is one who \n&gt;can interact with =\r\nANYONE (with any degrees of good and bad) and transform one \n&gt;into an ideal=\r\n person. For example, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa associated with \n&gt;drunkards a=\r\nnd womanizers like Girish and Kalipad and transformed them.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one thi=\r\nnks the world does not deserve one&#39;s services and lives in a cave, \n&gt;one ma=\r\ny be great and realized, but not a paramahamsa.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, lo=\r\nok at Parasara&#39;s directives on finding a paramahamsa. He said \n&gt;Mercury in =\r\n5th from karakamsa makes one a paramahamsa. Why Mercury and why not \n&gt;Jupit=\r\ner?\n&gt; \n&gt; Jupiter is wise, but Mercury is flexible and adaptive. Mercury can=\r\n identify \n&gt;with anyone. Mercury is compassionate and can place himself in =\r\nthe shoes of \n&gt;anyone and think/feel like that person. That is also why Mer=\r\ncury is the karaka \n&gt;for good communication skills. A good communicator can=\r\n visualize from the angle \n&gt;of his audience.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ramakrishna once identifi=\r\ned with grass so strongly that when a crow walked on \n&gt;the grass, there wer=\r\ne bloody scratches on his body. Such ability to identify \n&gt;with someone els=\r\ne is needed for transforming someone else. That is why Parasara \n&gt;mentioned=\r\n Mercury for Paramahamsa.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; //There is no dearth of Chanaky=\r\nas even today. There is, however, not a single \n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Chandragupta now. Few=\r\n &quot;experts&quot;, if any, know that Chanakya was a paramhamsa \n\n&gt; &gt; sadhu. He wen=\r\nt to jungle after saving the nation.//\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would disagree. Infact no=\r\n real Chanakya exists today which is the real \n&gt; &gt; problem. Creating a Chan=\r\ndragupta is easy for someone of Chanakya&#39;s caliber.\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree with Rajar=\r\nshi on this. If a Chanakya is on earth and ready to guide \n&gt;Chandragupta, a=\r\n Chandragupta would automatically come. If a Samartha Ramadas is \n&gt;on earth=\r\n and ready too guide Shivaji, a Shivaji would automatically come.\n&gt; \n&gt; In f=\r\nact, Swami Vivekananda once humbly said that Ramakrishna could have created=\r\n \n&gt;one thousand Vivekanandas from sand!\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; All your statemen=\r\nts in this thread are true, but sometimes\n&gt; &gt; differences in our language c=\r\nreate unnecessary confusions.\n&gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; Thus, I find your statements to b=\r\ne absolutely true. But\n&gt; &gt; greater clarity is needed at some points to ward=\r\n off\n&gt; &gt; possible confusions.\n&gt; \n&gt; I suspected that we did not have a real =\r\ndisagreement. But I was presenting a \n&gt;different perspective to balance the=\r\n presentation of ideas. However, the \n&gt;bottomline is that it is never possi=\r\nble to articulate this knowledge perfectly, \n&gt;using vaikhari. Knowledge lik=\r\ne this can be digested and absorbed only though \n&gt;experience and not throug=\r\nh reading or hearing words spoken in vaikhari. But \n&gt;then, words spoken in =\r\nvaikhari can serve the important purpose of inspiring one, \n&gt;perhaps to inv=\r\nestigate and/or to do sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is no alternative to sadhana, whe=\r\nther meditation or homam or \n&gt;contemplation or hatha yoga or whatever.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rhetorical Question, Vinay_ji...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If ALL references o=\r\nf GOD were to be possibly wiped out from the\n&gt; &gt; collective memory of human=\r\nity -- All kinds and forms of Gods and\n&gt; &gt; their NAMES really ---\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHow would the world and society look, feel, behave, act or react?\n&gt; \n&gt; Reli=\r\ngion has two purposes: (1) Enable some seekers to experience Self and \n&gt;bec=\r\nome liberated and (2) maintain some sanity, righteousness and order in the =\r\n\n&gt;world.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is no concept of god, no faith in god and no faith i=\r\nn after-life, \n&gt;world can then degenerate into adharmik, selfish and animal=\r\nistic pursuit of \n&gt;selfish needs of each person. However corrupted, religio=\r\nn and fear of god bring \n&gt;some sanity and order to the world!\n&gt; \n&gt; It is tr=\r\nue that some religions and some ideas of god may have degenerated very \n&gt;ba=\r\ndly and causing more harm than benefit. If so, such religions and ideas wil=\r\nl \n&gt;be cleaned up by the Natural Order when time comes, to be replaced by b=\r\netter \n&gt;ideas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesso=\r\nns, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and=\r\n Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a differ=\r\nence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWr=\r\nitings\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --=\r\n- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;VJha&quot; &lt;vinayjhaa16@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nDear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; All your statements in this thre=\r\nad are true, but sometimes differences in our \n&gt;language create unnecessary=\r\n confusions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Gyani should live like a fool, away from limelight&quot; =\r\n: this statement of \n&gt;Brahmopanishada is a general rule which needs no IF l=\r\nike &quot;if limelight \n&gt;duistracts one&quot;, because if limelight distracts, then t=\r\nhe person is not a \n&gt;full-fledged Gyani. To LIVE in limelight as a general =\r\nrule is foolishness for a \n&gt;Gyani, but sometimes Gyanis may come into limel=\r\night for some specific cause; it \n&gt;is the cause they care for and not the l=\r\nimelight or lack of it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; //What a gyani does *after* self-realizati=\r\non varies from one gyani to \n&gt;another.//\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes. Your keyword in &quot;Wha=\r\nt a gyani does&quot; is &quot;DOES&quot;, ie, Karma of a Gyani. It \n&gt;is very difficult to =\r\nunderstand KARMA, as Gita says. Proper definitions of \n&gt;Karma, Akarma, Vika=\r\nrma, etc, are needed. Since nobody can live without doing \n&gt;something, as G=\r\nita says, what is Akarma in fact? Whatever be the mode or type of \n&gt;action =\r\nof a Gyani, it is done without any desire of fruit for self, and \n&gt;therefor=\r\ne the actions of a Gyani should not be included in general Karma. The \n&gt;Kar=\r\nma which does not produce phala for the performer is Akarma. Brahmasutra \n&gt;=\r\nspeaks of four types of Moksha.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; //What a self-realized person does=\r\n is dependent on the previous history of \n&gt;that soul and what Nature expect=\r\ns from one.//\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Both YES and NO! A self-realized soul has to bear wh=\r\natever is written in \n&gt;his/her birthchart for THIS LIFE. But a self-realize=\r\nd soul burns away his/her \n&gt;entire previous history of Karmas and Samskaara=\r\ns and therefore does not NEED \n&gt;rebirth.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Liberated souls and incar=\r\nnations of divine agencies come again and again NOT \n&gt;for obeying Prakriti =\r\nblindly, but for Loka-samgraha, for which the entire \n&gt;Creation was created=\r\n. They gain nothing in return. Rgveda says &quot;..Adit-Suryas \n&gt;tapati Tapyatu =\r\nvrithaa.&quot; Mortals perform Tapa for gaining something material or \n&gt;spiritua=\r\nl. But why the Surya is performing Tapa? What Surya will gain? \n&gt;Loka-samgr=\r\naha, because the Surya perceives all other souls as its own parts and \n&gt;wan=\r\nts their well being.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; //to remain in duality, with the senses perce=\r\niving objects of duality, and \n&gt;yet remain in oneness with the underlying o=\r\nneness//\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes, this is the proper way of living in this world for a=\r\n self realized soul. \n&gt;There is no alternative in this world. One cannot re=\r\nmain in perpetual nirvikalpa \n&gt;samadhi in this world. But it is not proper =\r\nto call the former as a &quot;higher \n&gt;state&quot;. It is not advisable to discuss re=\r\nal Samadhi in a public fora.

Strange are the ways of God and Guru, but true disciples ar=\r\ne no less strange. Only a Guru knows how to tap the hidden potential of a d=\r\nisciple. But every disciple does not possess same potential.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;No para=\r\nmhamsa says that this\n world is unfit for his service. I am not a paramhams=\r\na, and I feel I can say so for Paramhamsas on account of what I have seen. =\r\nParamhamsas do not complain, because they are above such things. But others=\r\n like me feel the pain. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I sold my ancestral home for helping some S=\r\nanskrit institutions, and instead of helping I soon found that the entire s=\r\nociety wanted nothing but my money, without even caring for whether that mo=\r\nney will be used for education or not. All my life I worked for society, an=\r\nd later I found that it was my Lokaishanaa which was behind my zeal for the=\r\n good of society. Desire is hard to kill. It sublimates into seemingly beni=\r\ngn forms.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The real power to help others comes not from socio-economi=\r\nc or political power, but from real spiritual Knowledge combined with the i=\r\nnner Shakti of a pure soul. Those who possess this power can help others fr=\r\nom caves. Once, a great sadhu saved me from sure death by warning telepathi=\r\ncally from a\n distance of many miles. All the real sadhus I know keep away =\r\nfrom limelight as well as from humdrum of society, yet all the hamsas or pa=\r\nramhamsas among them help others without any reward.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Chandragupta wa=\r\ns lucky to find a great guru. But Chanakya was also lucky to find a great d=\r\nisciple. Such disciples cannot be created at will. The real war between dis=\r\nciples of Chanakya and Aristotle (Ari+stotra =3D praiser of demons, asuras)=\r\n has not been properly described by historians. Had Alexander conquered Ind=\r\nia, we would have lost our culture, history and identity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is n=\r\no dearth of Chanakyas. They will come out of caves when the need arises. An=\r\nd the need will soon arise. Centre of gravity of Western world is now turni=\r\nng backwards, from North America to Estern Europe and then to Greece-Egypt =\r\n&amp;c. And in the East, from Japan to China and then to India. First casua=\r\nlty of this sea change will be Christianity, at the hands of Islamic\n funda=\r\nmentalists. It will be accompanied with superpower status of India. It will=\r\n call many Chanakyas and Chandraguptas. SOON !&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I do not want to meas=\r\nure the heights or depths of hamsas and paramhamsas. They are all great, an=\r\nd that is all we need.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I do not see any essential difference with yo=\r\nu at any point, except in usage of certain words.&lt;BR&gt;It is a minor linguist=\r\nic problem.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rohiniranjan is not an atheist. He is a bhakt of MAA, an=\r\nd of Ganapati Ji too. He is rather imaginative and wants rebooting into a n=\r\new awakening, into new consciousness perhaps, bored with old religions. Per=\r\nhaps his personal experience of men of religion is not happy. But he never =\r\nfound a Guru, as far as I know, and he does not know the loss. Without a re=\r\nal Guru, religion is farce or at best a dead set of meaningless rituals. Gu=\r\nru imparts true meanings to our existence as well as to everything else.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-VJ&lt;BR&gt;=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D =3D&lt;BR&gt;--- In =\r\n&lt;A\n href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-astr=\r\nology@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Vinay ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Use of the term &quot;mental as=\r\nsylums&quot;, with &quot;ass-&quot; in asylum,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; reveals the mindset of a sick =\r\nsociety, which will not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; allow paramhamsa sadhus to live peacef=\r\nully in society,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and will abuse them if they seek solitude. Th=\r\nat is why&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I said in a recent post that the world does not dese=\r\nrve&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the service of paramhamsas now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am afra=\r\nid our understanding of the word &quot;paramahamsa&quot; is not the same..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Swan is supposed to able to remove water from milk. Similarly, a par=\r\namahamsa (absolute swan) is one who can extract out the bad in a person and=\r\n leave him with the good that is already in him. In other words, a paramaha=\r\nmsa is\n one who can interact with ANYONE (with any degrees of good and bad)=\r\n and transform one into an ideal person. For example, Ramakrishna Paramaham=\r\nsa associated with drunkards and womanizers like Girish and Kalipad and tra=\r\nnsformed them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If one thinks the world does not deserve on=\r\ne&#39;s services and lives in a cave, one may be great and realized, but not a =\r\nparamahamsa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In fact, look at Paras=\r\nara&#39;s directives on finding a paramahamsa. He said Mercury in 5th from kara=\r\nkamsa makes one a paramahamsa. Why Mercury and why not Jupiter?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Jupiter is wise, but Mercury is flexible and adaptive. Mercury can id=\r\nentify with anyone. Mercury is compassionate and can place himself in the s=\r\nhoes of anyone and think/feel like that person. That is also why Mercury is=\r\n the karaka for good communication skills. A good communicator can visualiz=\r\ne from the angle of his audience.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna once\n identi=\r\nfied with grass so strongly that when a crow walked on the grass, there wer=\r\ne bloody scratches on his body. Such ability to identify with someone else =\r\nis needed for transforming someone else. That is why Parasara mentioned Mer=\r\ncury for Paramahamsa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; //There =\r\nis no dearth of Chanakyas even today. There is, however, not a single &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Chandragupta now. Few &quot;experts&quot;, if any, know that Chanakya was a =\r\nparamhamsa &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhu. He went to jungle after saving the nation./=\r\n/&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I would disagree. Infact no real Chanakya exis=\r\nts today which is the real &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; problem. Creating a Chandragupta i=\r\ns easy for someone of Chanakya&#39;s caliber.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I agree with Raj=\r\narshi on this. If a Chanakya is on earth and ready to guide Chandragupta, a=\r\n Chandragupta would automatically come. If a Samartha Ramadas is on earth a=\r\nnd ready too guide Shivaji, a Shivaji would automatically\n come.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; In fact, Swami Vivekananda once humbly said that Ramakrishna could h=\r\nave created one thousand Vivekanandas from sand!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; All your statements in this thread are true, but sometim=\r\nes&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; differences in our language create unnecessary confusions.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, I find your statements to be absolutely=\r\n true. But&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; greater clarity is needed at some points to ward of=\r\nf&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; possible confusions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I suspected that we di=\r\nd not have a real disagreement. But I was presenting a different perspectiv=\r\ne to balance the presentation of ideas. However, the bottomline is that it =\r\nis never possible to articulate this knowledge perfectly, using vaikhari. K=\r\nnowledge like this can be digested and absorbed only though experience and =\r\nnot through reading or hearing words spoken in vaikhari. But then, words sp=\r\noken in vaikhari can serve the important purpose of\n inspiring one, perhaps=\r\n to investigate and/or to do sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There is no alternat=\r\nive to sadhana, whether meditation or homam or contemplation or hatha yoga =\r\nor whatever.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Rhetorical Questi=\r\non, Vinay_ji...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If ALL references of GOD were to=\r\n be possibly wiped out from the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; collective memory of humanity =\r\n-- All kinds and forms of Gods and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; their NAMES really ---&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; How would the world and society look, feel, behave, =\r\nact or react?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Religion has two purposes: (1) Enable some s=\r\neekers to experience Self and become liberated and (2) maintain some sanity=\r\n, righteousness and order in the world.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If there is no con=\r\ncept of god, no faith in god and no faith in after-life, world can then deg=\r\nenerate into adharmik, selfish and animalistic pursuit of selfish needs of =\r\neach person. However corrupted, religion and\n fear of god bring some sanity=\r\n and order to the world!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is true that some religions an=\r\nd some ideas of god may have degenerated very badly and causing more harm t=\r\nhan benefit. If so, such religions and ideas will be cleaned up by the Natu=\r\nral Order when time comes, to be replaced by better ideas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesson=\r\ns, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homa=\r\nm and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Fil=\r\nms that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D=\r\n_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish =\r\nwritings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.co=\r\nm&quot;&gt;vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;VJha&quot; &lt;vinayjhaa16@&gt; wrote:&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namast=\r\ne,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; All your statements in this thread are true, =\r\nbut sometimes differences in our language create unnecessary confusions.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Gyani should live like a fool, away from limeligh=\r\nt&quot; : this statement of Brahmopanishada is a general rule which needs no IF =\r\nlike &quot;if limelight duistracts one&quot;, because if limelight distracts, then th=\r\ne\n person is not a full-fledged Gyani. To LIVE in limelight as a general ru=\r\nle is foolishness for a Gyani, but sometimes Gyanis may come into limelight=\r\n for some specific cause; it is the cause they care for and not the limelig=\r\nht or lack of it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; //What a gyani does *after* se=\r\nlf-realization varies from one gyani to another.//&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Yes. Your keyword in &quot;What a gyani does&quot; is &quot;DOES&quot;, ie, Karma of a Gyani=\r\n. It is very difficult to understand KARMA, as Gita says. Proper definition=\r\ns of Karma, Akarma, Vikarma, etc, are needed. Since nobody can live without=\r\n doing something, as Gita says, what is Akarma in fact? Whatever be the mod=\r\ne or type of action of a Gyani, it is done without any desire of fruit for =\r\nself, and therefore the actions of a Gyani should not be included in genera=\r\nl Karma. The Karma which does not produce phala for the performer is Akarma=\r\n. Brahmasutra speaks of four types of Moksha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; /=\r\n/What a self-realized person does is dependent on the previous history of t=\r\nhat soul and what Nature expects from one.//&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bot=\r\nh YES and NO! A self-realized soul has to bear whatever is written in his/h=\r\ner birthchart for THIS LIFE. But a self-realized soul burns away his/her en=\r\ntire previous history of Karmas and Samskaaras and therefore does not NEED =\r\nrebirth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Liberated souls and incarnations of div=\r\nine agencies come again and again NOT for obeying Prakriti blindly, but for=\r\n Loka-samgraha, for which the entire Creation was created. They gain nothin=\r\ng in return. Rgveda says &quot;..Adit-Suryas tapati Tapyatu vrithaa.&quot; Mortals pe=\r\nrform Tapa for gaining something material or spiritual. But why the Surya i=\r\ns performing Tapa? What Surya will gain? Loka-samgraha, because the Surya p=\r\nerceives all other souls as its own parts and wants their well being.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; //to remain in duality, with the senses\n perceiving o=\r\nbjects of duality, and yet remain in oneness with the underlying oneness//&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yes, this is the proper way of living in this wo=\r\nrld for a self realized soul. There is no alternative in this world. One ca=\r\nnnot remain in perpetual nirvikalpa samadhi in this world. But it is not pr=\r\noper to call the former as a &quot;higher state&quot;.
