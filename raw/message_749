The instruction was to spread homam and create a com=\r\nmunity of \nsadhakas across the world who worship various deities in fire. I=\r\nt can \nbe any deities.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. The beauty of Chandi Path is that it instil=\r\nls a great sense of \ndiscipline in one. Even 13 chapters take a long time, =\r\nwithout anyting \nbefore or after.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kavacha, argala, keelaka, raatri so=\r\noktam, nyasas and moola mantra \nare recommended before, while nyasas, moola=\r\n mantra and devi sooktam \nare recommended after.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, in my humbl=\r\ne opinion, nothing is really compulsory. Doing \njust the 13 chapters everyd=\r\nay can be very powerful after a while. I \nsee nothing wrong in it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 3.=\r\n Both are correct and work differently. However, those who try \nwho pronoun=\r\nce the beeja mantras as &quot;aing hreeng&quot; invariably \nmisponounce them. The &quot;g&quot;=\r\n becomes explicit. Ideally, you should start \npronouncing as though you are=\r\n going to say &quot;aing&quot; and abruptly stop \njust when you are about to say &quot;g&quot;,=\r\n without saying it. It is not easy \nto pronounce this correctly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Inst=\r\nead of trying &quot;aing hreeng&quot; and messing it up, it is better to \njust say &quot;a=\r\nim hreem&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Internal purity and lack (or min=\r\nimization) of individualized ego is \nthe key in any sadhana. Thousands of h=\r\nours of sadhana without them is \nfruitless. One who is pure and has a very =\r\nlimited ego achieves \nresults quickly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There is a lot of misinformati=\r\non and unfounded fears that are \nspread regarding Chandi path. Do not worry=\r\n about them.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Eating an elaborate set of appetizers and desserts befor=\r\ne and after \na meal may be recommended. But one can get indigestion from it=\r\n too. \nIf the meal itself is correct for you, go ahead and enjoy it without=\r\n \nappetizers or dessert! Whatever you eat, eat it happily and \npositively t=\r\no get the most energy from it. Similarly, read whatever \nyou read with a se=\r\nnse of surrender and limited ego.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Instead of doing everything with a =\r\nlower focus, it is better to \njust do 13 chapters with a higher focus.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/t=\r\narpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jy=\r\notish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish soft=\r\nware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC)=\r\n website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   F=\r\nrom: Ashwin Rawal \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday,=\r\n December 09, 2008 6:51 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Maha Ganapati Homam/=\r\nChandi Homam\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Dear Narsimhaji\n&gt;         1.Since I have joine=\r\nd this group before some couple of \nmonths, some previous mails I have not =\r\nread.

However, Manish did not reveal that incident to me until \nmuch=\r\n later. All he told me at that time was that Narayan really \nneeded to do h=\r\nomam everyday and that I should teach a simple \nprocedure to him.\n&gt; \n&gt;     =\r\n      I experimented with homam, started doing occasionally and \nliked it. =\r\nI started doing a quick procedure everyday. After doing it \ndaily for a few=\r\n months, I finally got down to the original task - \nteaching Narayan. I cho=\r\nse to write a detailed manual for that \npurpose. In hindsight, I made the c=\r\norrect choice, as many people in \naddition to Narayan are able to do homam =\r\nusing the manual now! I and \nmany other people have benefited (and will ben=\r\nefit). However, as far \nas my mind concerned, all this started for Narayan!=\r\n When it was time \nfor Narayan to start doing homam, many people across the=\r\n world \nstarted with him. What a fortunate soul..\n&gt; \n&gt;           * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n           It was probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me \nat the=\r\n onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and \nmental stat=\r\ne would&#39;ve been different while working on the manual. I \nwould&#39;ve been mor=\r\ne egoistic and also hurried more. Because the only \nthing I was told was to=\r\n teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived \nat the correct balance and a=\r\nlso wrote it down without many \npretensions. The whole effort ended up bein=\r\ng more saattwik and I \nreally benefited from the exercise. If I had known t=\r\nhe full story, it \nwould have had more rajas given my mental state then and=\r\n I would not \nhave had made the same progress I made, while preparing mysel=\r\nf to \nteach homam to Narayan.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Manish told me the full story =\r\nonly when I was better \nprepared to handle the information and, of course, =\r\nI added it to the \npreface of the manual as asked by him then.\n&gt; \n&gt;        =\r\n   * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;           A good guru protects a sishya from unnecessary \ninf=\r\normation that can wreak havoc with the ego. I remember another \nincident.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;           One day in the spring of the same year, I decided to \nspend a=\r\n whole day meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming \nweekend. The i=\r\nnspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately \nlatched on to it. When I =\r\ntold Manish, he only said &quot;good, go ahead \nand do it&quot;. I started before sun=\r\nrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except \nfor 3-4 breaks of 2 min, a 20 min br=\r\neak at noon for bath and a small \nlunch and another 10 min break for anothe=\r\nr bath at dusk, I was \nbasically sitting in the same place and meditating w=\r\nith Gayatri \nmantra. It was a very good experience. I was in a very nice st=\r\nate at \nthe end of the day.\n&gt; \n&gt;           I noticed on the next day that t=\r\nhe previous day was \nAkshaya Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). It is cons=\r\nidered a very \nauspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sadhana on =\r\nthat day \nis 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I had not =\r\n\nnoticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was \nexcited.=\r\n When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days \nlater, he said=\r\n calmly &quot;I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell \nyou because knowing =\r\nit would&#39;ve distracted you. You would have been \nexcited at doing the sadha=\r\nna on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement \nwould&#39;ve changed the mental foc=\r\nus and brought more rajas into the \nsadhana.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;           He was absolut=\r\nely right. As such, I was &quot;proud&quot; of doing \nsuch a sadhana. The ego and pri=\r\nde brought rajas and limited the \nmental focus on the mantra. If I was awar=\r\ne that I was doing this \nsadhana on a powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased t=\r\nhe pride and \nexcitement, brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus o=\r\nn mantra \nfurther. Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes \nex=\r\ncellent progress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After \nhearing =\r\nManish&#39;s words, I introspected and found that my ego was \nstill alive and k=\r\nicking and that he was wise not to feed it with more \ndelicious food!\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n          Lucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell \nthem what=\r\n is useful rather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who \nhave a guru (=\r\nor someone else) who can go to the heart of their \nproblem and point it out=\r\n, so that they can weed it out through \nfurther introspection and weaken it=\r\n through conscious effort.\n&gt; \n&gt;           * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;           I remember o=\r\nne more similar incident. Before the shata \nchandi homam in early 2006, a p=\r\nriest we respect a lot took me to a \nSiddha (a perfected/advanced soul). Wh=\r\nen he looked at me, he \nmentioned the name of one of the saptarshis and sai=\r\nd that I very \nclose to him and that I would do some important work in this=\r\n birth.\n&gt; \n&gt;           When I saw Manish later that day, I mentioned this t=\r\no \nhim. He immediately became serious and said &quot;Narasimha, do you need \none=\r\n more identity? Your ego is already strong with the identity \nof &#39;Narasimha=\r\n, the Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the \nastrologer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the engi=\r\nneer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the spiritual \nseeker&#39; etc. It will take great effort to=\r\n overcome those identities \nand find True Self. As if that challenge is not=\r\n sufficient, do you \nreally need yet another new identity to feed your ego =\r\nfurther? See, \nwhat he said may very well be correct. But it is not useful =\r\nfor your \nprogress. You have to rise above all identities.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;           =\r\nHow true and wise!\n&gt; \n&gt;           * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;           Just as a fat and mi=\r\nghty dog may win over a lean and weak \ndog and get all the food given by th=\r\ne master, ahamkara (ego or the \nsense of &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the spiri=\r\nt of detachment and gets \nall the energy possible. Just as a good master ma=\r\ny chain the fat dog \nand feed the lean dog specially, we too must conscious=\r\nly try to \nrestrain ego and increase detachment.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Manish has =\r\na unique way of looking at things and some \nsimple points he made brought s=\r\no much clarity to my thinking and sped \nup my spiritual evolution in this l=\r\nife. Even without giving any \nspecific mantra to me, like many spiritual gu=\r\nrus do, he lit the lamp \nof knowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp an=\r\nd light were \nalready there and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that w=\r\nas \nblocking the light. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off \nth=\r\ne thick layer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) \nthat encl=\r\noses the lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we \nmay be too ca=\r\nught up to notice that dirt ourselves..\n&gt; \n&gt;           * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;          =\r\n Homam and other spiritual sadhana tools are very helpful. \nBut one should =\r\nalso try to introspect and change one&#39;s thinking, on \nan ongoing basis. The=\r\nre is no magic pill. For most people, this does \nnot take just a single mom=\r\nent or day or month or year. It CAN take a \nlong time. As Narayan indicated=\r\n, one should start walking on the path \nand not worry about the progress an=\r\nd the distance left. One who keeps \nwalking without distractions will reach=\r\n the goal.\n&gt; \n&gt;           The point I want to emphasize is that the externa=\r\nl \nrituals (like homam) and the internal introspection (to change \nattitude=\r\n) should go hand in hand. After a while, there will be \nsynergy between the=\r\nm and they will start to work together very \neffectively.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Be=\r\nst regards,\n&gt;           Narasimha\n&gt;           ------------ --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- -----\n---- -\n&gt;           Do a Short Homam Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAst \nrologer.org/ homam\n&gt;           Do Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAst \nrologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;           Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \nwisdom\n&gt;           Free Jyotish less=\r\nons (MP3): http://vedicastro. \nhome.comcast. net\n&gt;           Free Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst \nrologer.org\n&gt;           Sri Jaganna=\r\nth Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan \nnath.org\n&gt;           --------=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- -----\n---- -\n&gt; \n&gt;           --=\r\n-- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt;           &gt; Namaste =\r\nFriends,\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; Some ramblings ...\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n         &gt; Regarding fire getting extinguished (or anything \nsimilar to it)=\r\n, it\n&gt;           &gt; happens with all beginners and its only practice which \n=\r\nmakes one\n&gt;           &gt; perfect.

It then\n&gt;           &gt; occured to me he was really being serious. So, I=\r\n \nstarted searching on\n&gt;           &gt; the net and I found a really flimsy do=\r\ncument, but \nnevertheless I took\n&gt;           &gt; it up and performed it. But,=\r\n I was not satisfied. \nManishji then\n&gt;           &gt; reminded me of the book =\r\nhe gifted me, but even in that \nit was entirely\n&gt;           &gt; in Samskrit a=\r\nnd illiterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t \ndistinguish between\n&gt;           &gt; an i=\r\nnstruction and sloka :). Around this time, \nNarasimha occasionally\n&gt;       =\r\n    &gt; performed a longer version of the homam and I \nparticpated in it, but=\r\n\n&gt;           &gt; never could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to guide \nme, w=\r\nhich he\n&gt;           &gt; did, but still it did not get through my really dense=\r\n \nbrains :). I\n&gt;           &gt; felt really helpless, but the stars were such =\r\nthat I \nnever gave up,\n&gt;           &gt; instead I made a sincere prayer to Lor=\r\nd Ganesha, that \nIf he really\n&gt;           &gt; intends that I perform the homa=\r\n, then he should kindly \nshow me the\n&gt;           &gt; way. In around two weeks=\r\n time, Narasimha told me that \nhe has decided\n&gt;           &gt; to document the=\r\n Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I \njust couldnt\n&gt;           &gt; believe =\r\nmy luck and thanked the Elephant-headed \nomnipotent for his\n&gt;           &gt; g=\r\nrace. Well ... its been exactly 2yrs and I am still at \nit taking\n&gt;        =\r\n   &gt; baby-steps and making progress everyday.\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; =\r\nI thank Manishji, Narasimha and the all the divine \nforces for helping\n&gt;   =\r\n        &gt; me progress.\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; My request, pls dont gi=\r\nve it up, persist with it no \nmatter what.

A servant simply serves the master. \nSimilarly, all the \n&gt;       =\r\n    &gt; &gt; sadhana you do and your other activities are your way \nto serve you=\r\nr \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; master.\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; A rich land=\r\nlord may be very wealthy and have many \nbig checks \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; everyda=\r\ny to cash and also many big checks everyday to \nmail others. \n&gt;           &gt;=\r\n &gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers \nto the bank and \n=\r\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing \nanythin=\r\ng in this \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; world and yet god needs human beings who execute=\r\n \ngod&#39;s agenda in this \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; world. That is why various gods (in=\r\ncluding Vishnu \nhimself) and \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming ba=\r\nck to earth every now \nand then. The \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; supreme god of this w=\r\norld operates through various \nphysical persons \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; present on=\r\n earth.\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritua=\r\nl sadhana, purify \nourselves and try \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; to help others, becau=\r\nse that is god&#39;s work. Just as a \nservant carries \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; master&#39;s=\r\n papers to the bank, we do such work for god.\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;         =\r\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded by others as good work \ntends to promote eg=\r\no \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; and we need to guard against it. A servant carrying a \nm=\r\nillion dollar \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; check to the bank and cashing it is NOT supe=\r\nrior to a \nservant \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; carrying a $100 check to the bank and c=\r\nashing it. \nBoth are merely \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; doing their master&#39;s work and =\r\ndo not own anything. \nBoth are just \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; *instruments* used by =\r\nthe master to carry out his \nagenda. Similarly, \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; one who do=\r\nes what are considered great deeds in this \nworld and one \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; =\r\nwho does what are considered meagre deeds in this \nworld are both \n&gt;       =\r\n    &gt; &gt; servants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in \nthis world. \n&gt;=\r\n           &gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything. One may consider \noneself supe=\r\nrior to \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; the other because his/her deeds are considered \nsu=\r\nperior by the world, \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; but he/she is just as foolish as a se=\r\nrvant who \nconsiders \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; himself/herself superior to another s=\r\nervant carrying \nsomething less \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; valuable.\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; If this attitude of being a servant of god fully \npene=\r\ntrates one&#39;s \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; attitude, thinking and instincts, one is safe=\r\n no \nmatter what \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; situations his previous karmas place one =\r\nin.

Can a homam\n&gt;  =\r\n         &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand \nbase be \n&gt;=\r\n           &gt; &gt; used instead of a\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; copper one?\n&gt;         =\r\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the=\r\n \nopen is \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; actually better than doing it in closed space. B=\r\nut \nrealize that a \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrel=\r\nla around to \nprotect the fire \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; if it rains while you are d=\r\noing homam. It is not good \nif fire is \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; extinguished by rai=\r\nn in the middle of a homam.\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you c=\r\nan construct a homa kundam with bricks \nand sand \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; at the bo=\r\nttom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio \nfile, \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; =\r\nshould one repeat the\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras mentally along with the a=\r\nudio?\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; One can repeat mentally while li=\r\nstening attentively \n(not \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; casually). Actually, even listen=\r\ning to mantras with \nall the attention \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; focused is as power=\r\nful as saying mantras.\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose person =\r\nX is chanting a mantra and thinking \nof \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; some mundane matte=\r\nr in the mind. Suppose person Y is \nlistening to it \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; with f=\r\nocus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. \nThen the mantra \n&gt;         =\r\n  &gt; &gt; may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may \nbenefit from the \n&gt;=\r\n           &gt; &gt; mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the \nmind&quot;.=\r\n. One can \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protec=\r\nted. \nThe key is \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the min=\r\nd focused on \nthe mantra.\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; However, the=\r\nre is a difference between meditation \nand \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; homam. Mantra i=\r\ns submitted in the internal fire in \nmeditation and it \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; is =\r\nsubmitted in the external fire as well in a homam. \nSo making some \n&gt;      =\r\n     &gt; &gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as \nopposed to sile=\r\nnt \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt;    =\r\n       &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? A=\r\nny Other \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shoul=\r\nd be followed apart from having vegeterain \nfood?\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;     =\r\n      &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread \nceremony) \n&gt;     =\r\n      &gt; &gt; has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is \nirrelevant.=\r\n\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; One should follow the yamas and niyam=\r\nas set by \none&#39;s \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one=\r\n should \nfollow them \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; strictly. At the minimum, one should =\r\neat only \nvegetarian food on the \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; day of homam and take a b=\r\nath before homam. Another \nrule I will \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; recommend is to avo=\r\nid eating any solid food 2 hours \nbefore homam.\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;       =\r\n    &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to \ndo \n&gt;       =\r\n    &gt; &gt; homam for spiritual progress, I am willing to take \nresponsibility =\r\nand \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; allow them to do it. Such a person can think of me or =\r\n\nmy guru as guru \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; and perform homam. I am willing to take o=\r\nn any karma \nincurred in the \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; process until the person cros=\r\nses some minimum \nthreshhold of purity \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; through homam and o=\r\nther spiritual practices. Sacred \nthread or no \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; sacred thre=\r\nad, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it \ndoes not matter \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; a=\r\nfter a while, when the person crosses a threshhold \nof purity. The \n&gt;      =\r\n     &gt; &gt; goal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is \nto speed thi=\r\ns up \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n&gt;=\r\n           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; As long as one desires no specific mate=\r\nrial \nbenefits (and \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; ready to receive whatever god gives) a=\r\nnd does homam \nfor spiritual \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; progress, I am willing to hel=\r\np, even if it means some \nsuffering for \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; me.\n&gt;           &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day \nwo=\r\nuld be \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; fine?\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; For Maha=\r\nganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi \nmorning. \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; But any=\r\n day is fine really.\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt;          =\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of =\r\nmy \nIndia \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; trip.\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; When =\r\nI went to India in May 2008, I and my guru \nManish \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; travele=\r\nd together to several places (on a specific \nproject). We ended \n&gt;         =\r\n  &gt; &gt; up doing homam in the morning in several places \n(wherever we were). =\r\n\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella \nwit=\r\nh me. As \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did n=\r\not \ntake it \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; seriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. W=\r\ne \nproceeded to the \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; rooftop of the apartment complex we we=\r\nre in, to do a \nhomam. Manish \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Narasimha, it is g=\r\noing to rain heavily in \nthis city after \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; our homam finishe=\r\ns&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; To my surprise, it =\r\ndid rain as soon as our homas \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; finished. After we offered p=\r\noornaahuti, it suddenly \nstarted raining \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; with really big d=\r\nrops. Luckily, there was a small \ntowel/blanket on \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; the roo=\r\nftop close to us. Together, we held it on top \nof the two small \n&gt;         =\r\n  &gt; &gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held \nthe cloth cover =\r\n\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas \nwent=\r\n off and \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; then packed everything and went down. We left for=\r\n \nKurukshetra later \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; that day, but we were told that a heav=\r\ny rain \ncontinued for a few days \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; in New Delhi. In fact, ra=\r\nin followed us on that trip \nas we covered \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; the north, east=\r\n and west of India. It rained in every \nplace we went \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; to, =\r\nas we finished our task in that place and \nprepared to move on.\n&gt;          =\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;      =\r\n     &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------\n -----\n&gt;   =\r\n        &gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAst \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; rologer.org/ homam\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tar=\r\npanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;=\r\n           &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic-\n \n&gt;  =\r\n         &gt; &gt; wisdom\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ve=\r\ndicastro. \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; home..comcast. net\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh software (Windows): \nhttp://www.VedicAst \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; rologer.org\n&gt;  =\r\n         &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: \nhttp://www.SriJagan \n&gt; =\r\n          &gt; &gt; nath..org\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- =\r\n--------- ---------\n -----\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;     =\r\n      &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; \nwrote: \n&gt;   =\r\n        &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am int=\r\nerested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam \ndaily, and \n&gt;           &gt; &gt; have few =\r\nquestions\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regarding it.\n&gt;           &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;         =\r\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a \nhouse(3-\n&gt;        =\r\n   &gt; &gt; floors) ?
