On the contrary, I almost deci=\r\nded to unequivocally assert that everybody interested in spiritual progress=\r\n can do homam. Period. But I wanted to be cautious and not take on traditio=\r\nnal orthodoxy head-on. Instead of dismissing fully, I was trying to put the=\r\n fundamental reasons in perspective and say that a total ban makes no sense=\r\n and push back the responsibility of decision to individuals. I am sure I w=\r\nill gain confidence with time and be more assertive. I just need to become =\r\nready to take on some karmas in corner cases. Then I can make that assertio=\r\nn.\n \nIn the old days, men did so much spiritual sadhana, so many rituals an=\r\nd so much tapascharya that women did not need to do anything. Just run the =\r\nhouse, get groceries, cook, serve food and your husband builds enough spiri=\r\ntual bank balance for both of you. But things are not the same anymore! Mos=\r\nt men today are worldly people and don&#39;t do enough spiritual sadhana for th=\r\nemselves, let alone for their wives!\n \nGiven this situation, women cannot r=\r\nely on husbands for spiritual progress. I believe that women should be allo=\r\nwed to perform rituals like homam, tarpanam etc for their own spiritual evo=\r\nlution. I know some ladies who are performing Mahaganapathi homam using the=\r\n manual on my website now and enjoying it.\n \nThe risks I mentioned are only=\r\n for rare cases and most people need not worry. The issue about Kundalini r=\r\nising, getting stuck in Swadhishthana and tough testing in that area applie=\r\ns to both men and women. In any case, fire worship with complete surrender =\r\nto a deity is quite likely to help one skip over this. The risk about pregn=\r\nancy also affects very rare cases. In general, one need not worry. To be ex=\r\ntra-cautious, one can skip serious sadhanas like homam during pregnancy. Al=\r\nso, women doing homam should stop during the monthly periods time.\n \nAfter =\r\ndoing homam a few times, most people will only experience an indescribable =\r\ncalmness and pleasure coming from the cleansing of various nadis and chakra=\r\ns and resultant extra flow of praana vaayu in the sookshma sareera. Things =\r\nlike Kundalini awakening and rise do not happen in most people. Actually, m=\r\nost people talking about Kundalini flow actually mistake smoother praana va=\r\nayu flow for Kundalini flow. Most yogis do not ever experience the latter. =\r\nSo most of what I wrote is inapplicable to most people anyway. Let me not t=\r\nrivialize it though - little bit of praana flowing better itself is a great=\r\n experience and one should try for it.\n \nWhen several women contacted me fo=\r\nr further clarifications and asked whether they could do Mahaganapathi homa=\r\nm, I always encouraged them. The feedback from all of them was very positiv=\r\ne.\n \nThe assertion that men and women are different only at the sthoola sar=\r\neera level and the sooksha sareera and kaarana sareera have no sex is absol=\r\nutely correct. By the way, men may be reborn as women and vice versa.\n \nTha=\r\nnks for the kind words. The &quot;resourcefulness&quot; and time are not really mine.=\r\n When a king and his minister decide to distribute some of king&#39;s money to =\r\npeople, the minister will summon a servant to do the work and the servant w=\r\nill take the money to people and distribute it. But it does not makes him t=\r\nhe owner of anything. He is merely fortunate to be picked for that good kar=\r\nma. Of course, even the minister will actually say that he too is a servant=\r\n only and will say that king is responsible for this action and the money i=\r\ns really king&#39;s.\n \nThat analogy is perfect here. Of course, if it is not cl=\r\near, the Divine Mother is the king, my guru is the minister, I am the serva=\r\nnt and the manuals, writings and private talks I share are the king&#39;s money=\r\n being distributed. I am not being humble or politically correct. This is a=\r\nbsolutely the only truth. Anything else would merely be an ignorant fool&#39;s =\r\ndelusion.\n \nRegarding the practical usefulness of homam, there is no doubt.=\r\n I have seen its transformational power with real people in front of my own=\r\n eyes.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ta=\r\nrpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish=\r\n lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:=\r\n http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------- \n \n--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, 108ar &lt;bona_mente@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I read your inspiring/convincing/enli=\r\nghtening words on homam/s/.
