The meditation too\n&gt; happened in a more focused and better way.\n\nThere may be a couple of factors behind this.\n\nThe energy of some deities is more active during night than the day. After \nall, night is symbolic of the primordial state of the universe. Deities \npersonifying the energies and state of the universe in the initial \nprimordial stages are easier to identify with during the night. Thus, if you \ndo homam for Mahaakaala, Kaali, Bhairava etc, night time is more apt.\n\nMore importantly, some people doing homam in the morning before going to \nwork feel some kind of time pressure in the mind (atleast sub-consciously). \nWhen you know that you have to finish and go to work in another 30 min or \nhour or whatever, that pressure may be at the back of the mind. Whereas if \none does at the end of the day, when there is no pressure of any kind, the \nmind may be more relaxed and one may be able to focus better.\n\nIn any case, I suggest not worrying about all these things and starting the \npractice with some time or the other. If morning is convenient, do in the \nmorning. If evening is convenient, do in the evening. If night is \nconvenient, do in the night. Pick a time and do it at that time everyday or \nevery week or at whatever frequency you have chosen. After you do it for a \nwhile, then you may think of experimenting with a different time and see \nwhich time is working better. In the beginning, it pays to just get started \nwith some time or the other.\n\n&gt; I also feel some sort of activity/squeeze ai the solar\n&gt; plexus....sort of ,what one feels at the heart when\n&gt; one sees an emotional movie.Why is this?\n\nWhen one focuses mind on a mantra, one MAY feel activity in various parts of \nthe body, like a tingling sensation or pressure or heat or coldness or \ncrawling of ants etc. Such activity may be felt in various parts of the \nbody, like the crown of the head or forehead or throat or heart or solar \nplexus etc. It merely shows the movement of praana vaayu in various chakras \nand nadis that are in need of praana (life force). For example, Manipoora \nchakra in the solar plexus area is the seat of fire element, which is the \ncenter of one&#39;s sense of control and pride. Any personality traits related \nto short temper, pride, anger etc will be linked to some deficiencies in the \nManipoora chakra. When one is able to focus in meditation well, some praana \nmay be moving in the Manipoora chakra area and trying to improve the \ndeficiency.\n\nSimilarly, if a considerable amount of praana moves in particular nadis, one \nmay even get a sensation of moving up ot tilting to a side or back etc.\n\nBut the important thing is to ignore all these and not be distracted by any \nof these sensations. Awareness and analysis of the sensation distracts the \nmind from its focus on the mantra. As praana moves everywhere and clears all \ndeficiencies, one becomes ready for realization.\n\n&gt; I am at presnt doing the bare minimum homa vidhi.Can i\n&gt; meditate even after the fire has gone out.I use ghee, so it\n&gt; does not last very long after the aahutis are done.And i\n&gt; would like to stay &#39;There&#39; more.\n\nYes, you can meditate even after the fire goes off. Homam burns some \ninternal impurities and internal purity is at a maximum (local maximum) \nimmediately following homam. Just sit and meditate as long as you can. After \nthat, as the day progresses and we start thinking of various things, newer \nimpurities may accumulate again. So meditating immediately after homam is \nhelpful to maximize the effect.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;sunita_vt&quot; &lt;sunita_vt@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, May 25, 2009 7:42 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Can I perform homam any time?\n\n\nNamaste,\nI too do havan in the evening,but before sunset.I do it around 6 pm.\nIt always feels great.\nI also feel some sort of activity/squeeze ai the solar plexus....sort of \n,what one feels at the heart when one sees an emotional movie.Why is this?\nI am at presnt doing the bare minimum homa vidhi.Can i meditate even after \nthe fire has gone out.I use ghee, so it does not last very long after the \naahutis are done.And i would like to stay &#39;There&#39; more.\n\nRegards,\nSunita.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a little experience to share in this regard. Initially I used to do \n&gt; homas always in the morning, before leaving for office.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then after a few months one day I did it at night, around 8/8:30 after \n&gt; returning from office. I felt a papable and far stronger effect when I did \n&gt; the homa at night. The meditation too happened in a more focused and \n&gt; better way. Next time when I did teh homa, again at night, then too I felt \n&gt; a similar and strong kind of energy. I don&#39;t know if it is the same for \n&gt; everyone but I try and do my homas at night mostly.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Mon, 25/5/09, Narasimha P.V.R.
