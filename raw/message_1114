He has his own \ntraditional way of doing Homam wh=\r\nich he had learnt from his father. \nHe complained me that it is difficult t=\r\no perform homa in small flats \nin Dubai because of the amount of smoke whic=\r\nh is generated by the \nwood. I stressed on Dry Coconut and gave my example.=\r\n i pressed him \nto use &#39;dry coconut&#39; for his planned homa. As the thing tur=\r\nned out \nvery well for him by using Dry coconut and he later told us that \n=\r\nHomam went very well with Dry coconut. &#39;Thanks to Utpal&#39; - i \ninstantly sai=\r\nd, say thanks to Garu! i am just a postman :)\n\non a lighter note-There is a=\r\n lovely Store here, which keeps all \ntraditional Indian Items. You&#39;ll get a=\r\nlmost everything including Dry \nCoconut Halves (As well as full dry coconut=\r\n). When i started \nfrequenting that store for purchasing 1 or 2 kg of Dry C=\r\noconut twice \na week, they were very suprised. one day they asked me as to =\r\nwhat i \nam doing with this dry coconut. i said &#39;Havan&#39; - looked at me as if=\r\n \nlooking at some person from a different planet :(\n\n\njovial regards,\n\nUtpa=\r\nl\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

They are readily available in India, but very difficu=\r\nlt to \nfind in the west.\n&gt;  \n&gt; By dry coconut, I mean copra and not the coc=\r\nonut shell. The shell \ncan be used, but it generates a lot of smoke like fi=\r\nrewood. Copra \n(dry coconut) has a good amount of oil in it and hence burns=\r\n nicely \nwithout much smoke. Fresh wet coconut has a little water also in i=\r\nt \nand hence generates some smoke and does not burn well. Dry coconut \ncatc=\r\nhes fire easily, burns well and generates less smoke.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am sorry your=\r\n first homam did not go well. But keep trying. I am \nsure you will make ver=\r\ny good spiritual progress through homam and \nthrough Chandipath. In the sho=\r\nrt run, April 9-June 10 is a good \nperiod for you for spiritual sadhana. In=\r\n the long run, Sept 2010-\nSept 2017 is the period to watch out. I am quite =\r\nconfident that you \nare on the verge of a transformation.
