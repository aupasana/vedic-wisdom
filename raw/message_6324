It includes offerings to Vedic deities \ns=\r\nuch as Prajapati, Indra, Soma etc, but explains it in a way that \nopen-mind=\r\ned non-Hindus can rationalize and relate internally. It allows \nnon-Hindus =\r\nto incorporate their faith and sacred chants of their faith \ninto a fire ri=\r\ntual procedure that is essentially taken from Hinduism. \nPlease go to:\n\nhtt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org/fire\n\nPlease feel free to send suggestions and =\r\ncomments to me at \npvr108@.... This is the first attempt and can evol=\r\nve over time. \nThe goal is to enable as many people as possible to approach=\r\n the divine \nvia the sacred medium of fire.\n\n*        *        *\n\nA few mon=\r\nths back, Manish sat next to an American lady in a flight. His \nintuition t=\r\nold him to tell her a few things. He told her a few things \nthat would happ=\r\nen in the next few months. He told her she MUST do a fire \nritual regularly=\r\n to overcome some serious problems in her life. He also \ngave her his email=\r\n address. She told me later that she thought he was \n&quot;insane&quot; to talk to a =\r\nstranger like that. Later, when some specific \nthings happened as told by M=\r\nanish, some to the day, she developed trust \nin Manish (Manish told me he w=\r\nas just acting on his intuition withought \nknowing why). She emailed him an=\r\nd later talked to him. Manish \nre-iterated to her that she MUST do fire rit=\r\nual to overcome current and \nfuture problems and he put her in touch with m=\r\ne.\n\nI gave her the Mahaganapati homam manual, but it was Greek and Latin to=\r\n \nher. She is a practicing Christian and does not know much about \nHinduism=\r\n. She was totally lost in in the manual and could not put it to \nuse, thoug=\r\nh she really wanted to do a fire ritual. I spent an hour on \nphone with her=\r\n and explained a simple procedure that she could relate \nto, remember and d=\r\no. She did homam a few times and found it to have a \nsoothing and calming i=\r\nnfluence, though she was very nervous, afraid and \ntense when she started o=\r\nut. Another friend of her, also a practicing \nChristian with open-mindednes=\r\ns to other practices, was also interested \nin trying fire ritual and asked =\r\nfor info. This made me think of writing \na manual suitable for a group curr=\r\nenly left out.\n\n*        *        *\n\nCoincidentally, Manish, I and a few ot=\r\nher friends had a discussion a \nmonth back about non-Hindus performing fire=\r\n ritual. Though some sincere \nand learned friends had reservations, I opine=\r\nd: &quot;If one cannot relate to \na Sanskrita mantra and can relate to a Latin o=\r\nr Greek or Arabic chant, I \nsee no problem in offering that to god. I do no=\r\nt really think Agni will \nsay &quot;I do not know that god and cannot carry the =\r\noffering to that god&quot;. \nI do not see gods as Hindu gods and non-Hindu gods =\r\nand see all of them \nas personifications of various natures and qualities i=\r\nnherent to us. I \nreckon that Agni is capable of translating. Thus, I am no=\r\nt averse to \nenabling non-Hindus to do a fire ritual by essentially retaini=\r\nng the \nbasic homam structure, but replacing the main mantra of pradhaana h=\r\nomam \nsection with a non-Sanskrit sacred chant.&quot;\n\nI had copied Sri Robert S=\r\nvoboda (author of Aghora series on Vimalananda) \non that discussion. He put=\r\n his view on record in a private email: &quot;Just \nfor the record, my view is v=\r\nery similar to yours =E2=80=93 the important thing \nis to create a relation=\r\nship with fire, and via the fire, with Brahman, \nNirguna or Saguna =E2=80=\r\n=93 Saguna being much easier. There are many devatas in \nthe world, and I t=\r\noo do not really think Agni will say &quot;I do not know \nthat god and cannot ca=\r\nrry the offering to that god&quot;. I too do not see \ngods as Hindu gods and non=\r\n-Hindu gods; if Agni can be purohit for one, \nhe can be purohit for any.&quot;\n\n=\r\n*        *        *\n\nIf you know of some people who are not well-versed in =\r\nHinduism but are \nopen-minded to try new spiritual practices, please feel f=\r\nree to point \nthem to this document.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Soft=\r\nware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manua=\r\nls for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n=\r\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish w=\r\nritings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                    =\r\n  Twitter ID: @homam108\n---------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n\n"}}
