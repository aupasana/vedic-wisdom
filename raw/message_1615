Others (interested in money, \n&gt; &gt; power and pleasures) ar=\r\ne not qualified for self-realization. It has nothing \n&gt; &gt; to do with the th=\r\ne birth caste.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regarding women:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Veda is for self-knowledg=\r\ne. Study and contemplation of Veda is for \n&gt; &gt; self-realization. Spirituall=\r\ny speaking, Shiva is the potential energy and \n&gt; &gt; Shakti is the kinetic en=\r\nergy. Men are supposed to have more Shiva than \n&gt; &gt; Shakti in them and wome=\r\nn are supposed to have more Shakti than Shiva in \n&gt; &gt; them. If a man is rea=\r\nlly like Shiva, he can study and experience Veda and \n&gt; &gt; realize self and =\r\nhis wife can realize self through him. That would be a good \n&gt; &gt; strategy.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, men are hardly like Shiva today. In fact, there is very l=\r\nittle \n&gt; &gt; Shiva in anyone and there is more Shakti (kinetic energy) in wom=\r\nen as well \n&gt; &gt; as men today. Moreover, most men do not do any spiritual sa=\r\ndhana at all. The \n&gt; &gt; rules make no sense anymore.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the old day=\r\ns, rishis pursued knowledge and spiritual sadhana, while their \n&gt; &gt; wives r=\r\nan the houses. The sadhana of rishis was sufficient for them and \n&gt; &gt; their=\r\n wives. Today&#39;s men are different. Whenever I go to a poojas at the \n&gt; &gt; ho=\r\nuses of friends, I see all women gathering at the pooja and chanting \n&gt; &gt; m=\r\nantras, while all men sit elsewhere and chat about sports, politics and \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; movies. The world is a changed place. Women cannot rely on their men to d=\r\no \n&gt; &gt; spiritual sadhana for them and they are on their own. Men are not li=\r\nke \n&gt; &gt; Shiva. Rules composed long back do not apply anymore.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Upas=\r\nani maharaj, who was worshipped by Shirdi Sai Baba himself as god, was a \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; great Vedic scholar who taught veda and yajna to women! I respect his \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; judgment and its relevance today more than the relevance of an ancient \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; dharma shastra. Universal dharma needs to be redefined from time to tim=\r\ne by \n&gt; &gt; realized souls. It becomes stale otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is the =\r\nproblem with some religions that are based on a written text. \n&gt; &gt; The text=\r\n may have been good for a specific desa-kaala-paatra, but may have \n&gt; &gt; bec=\r\nome stale now. Fortunately, sanatana dharma (aka Hinduism) does not \n&gt; &gt; de=\r\npend on one specific text. We emphasize sadhana to realize truth rather \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; than adherence to a text. This emphasis on active sadhana ensured a \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ncontinuous flow of realized souls. We had many realized souls (like \n&gt; &gt; Jn=\r\naneshwar Maharaj, Samartha Ramadas, Sai Baba, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Ramana Maharshi etc) from time to time and they refined our understanding.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Religions that emphasized adherence to a text rather than active sadh=\r\nana to \n&gt; &gt; realize truth depended on an old text put together by one reali=\r\nzed soul and \n&gt; &gt; they may have become stale now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- -\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyo=\r\ntish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre=\r\n (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ---=\r\n-- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;Jagmohan Nanaware&quot; &lt;jagmohan_nanaware@ ...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-w=\r\nisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, April 07, 2009 1:57 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subj=\r\nect: [vedic-wisdom] Women reading Vedas (Re: reading/learning the veda)\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Excellent explanation from you Narasimha-=\r\nji!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just have some doubts:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The code of conduct about reci=\r\nting vedas (who can do it) are prescribed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in Manusmriti.

He was a great devot=\r\nee of Krishna and was a fully self-\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; realized\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; master at a yo=\r\nung age. He reformed religion and corrected some\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; corrupt\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; tr=\r\naditions. He once made a buffalo chant Veda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He started t=\r\no recite Veda and the head of the Brahmin council\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; forbade him\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; because he was not &quot;qualified&quot; to recite Veda. Jnaneshwar insisted\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; everyone had a right to recite Veda and the head of the cou=\r\nncil\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; disagreed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As he started reciting Veda, the Brahmins t=\r\nried to stop him by\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; closing his\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mouth. Then a buffalo stand=\r\ning next to him took over and chanted\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Veda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Astounded by th=\r\ne miracle, the Brahmins fell at his feet. The head\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; apologized\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; and said, &quot;we are masquerading as the keepers of Veda, but you have\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; the real\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; understanding and mastery of Veda&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nJnaneshwar taught the equality of all and did not distinguish\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; betwee=\r\nn people\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; based on caste, creed or gender. He considered BhagavadGi=\r\nta as the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; essence\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of Veda and wrote a fantastic commentary =\r\non it.

He said that the physical body we have=\r\n is called\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;stree sareera&quot; and the inner body we have i=\r\ns called the &quot;purusha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sareera&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He said that the physical b=\r\nody comes from mother and the soul comes\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; father and th=\r\nat is why they are called so. The soul or inner self\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n thousand-headed purusha within us (described in purusha sooktam).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; He said that Veda is supposed to be recited with the purusha\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; sareera.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; According to him, it does not mean that women cannot r=\r\nead it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Whether men or\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; women, they have to read it with the=\r\n purusha sareera, i.e. inner\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; body, and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; not just with the ph=\r\nysical body. So, according to him, the standard\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; convention is base=\r\nd on a flawed understanding. According to him,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; one simply\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; r=\r\neciting Veda with the mouth without the correct internal\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; understandi=\r\nng is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; only reading with the &quot;stree sareera&quot; and hence not doing th=\r\ne right\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, re=\r\nciting Veda and chanting the verses is one thing and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; understanding=\r\n them is quite another. When we make sound, there are\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; four\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nlevels of it - vaikhari, madhyama, pasyanti and para. Vibration of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; m=\r\naterial\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; belonging to the gross body (sthoola sareera) produces vai=\r\nkhari\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; level of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sound and it is heard through the senses bel=\r\nonging to the gross\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; body (ears).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But vibrations at the leve=\r\nl of subtle body (sookshma sareera) and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; vibrations\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at the l=\r\nevel of astral body (kaarana sareera) are also there and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; can be\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; perceived thorough subtle perception.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If one is chan=\r\nting &quot;Om Namo Narayanaya&quot; and thinking of some\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mundane\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; matt=\r\ners, the vibrations produced at levels above vaikhari will not\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; be\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; auspicious. There is so much stress on what we do physically and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; people\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; forget that what happens at the other layers of existen=\r\nce is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; equally, if not\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more, important!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If=\r\n you produce the correct vibrations at all levels (not just\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; physical=\r\n)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; while &quot;reciting&quot; any Vedic mantra, you can truly &quot;experience&quot; th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mantra. A\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; full experience of a single Vedic mantra may be=\r\n sufficient to alter\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; life! The mantras of Veda are mo=\r\nst powerful. Unfortunately, so much\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vedic\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; scholarship th=\r\nese days is only superficial (but it has to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; encouraged,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nbecause it will keep atleast one level of knowledge alive).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Forget the man vs woman controversy. The difference between genders\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; is only\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in the gross body. When you go to the subtle body and a=\r\nstral body,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; there is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; no difference at all. One should reali=\r\nze that the role of gross\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; body is too\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; limited in the correc=\r\nt recitation/experien ce of a Vedic mantra. It\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; purit=\r\ny of the subtle body and the lightness of the astral body that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are f=\r\nar\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; more important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To be=\r\n fair and balanced, I need to throw light on the other angle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Like I=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; said, Vedic mantras are too powerful. They are capable of produci=\r\nng\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a full\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; self-realization (actually the sole purpose of Ve=\r\nda is &quot;to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; self&quot;).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; However, given the depth of Kali Yug=\r\na, it is difficult for it to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; come in one\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shot. It comes in =\r\nsteps. When one is half way down the path, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; has to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ca=\r\nreful and under the vigilant guidance of a sadguru.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; When =\r\none is not fully realized and the gross body has a role to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; play, the=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are some differences based on the gender that come into play.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; If a lady carrying a baby in her womb has certain spiritua=\r\nl\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; experiences\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (which a good Vedic chanting is capable of br=\r\ninging), there can\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; even be an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; abortion (or a great siddha b=\r\neing born, on the other extreme).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; There is another subtle=\r\n factor. Good Vedic chanting can bring an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; awakening\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of Kund=\r\nalini (i.e. an awakening of self-awareness) and an ascent of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kunda=\r\nlini (i.e. an ascent of self-awareness) . Though some people\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; may hav=\r\ne a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wrong impression about Kundalini because of the corrupt practi=\r\nces\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; section of so-called &quot;Kundalini sadhakas&quot;, the fac=\r\nt is that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Kundalini merely\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; represents one&#39;s ego-consciousne=\r\nss. When one casually associates\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the body\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; one sees with &quot;se=\r\nlf&quot;, Kundalini is asleep in the Mooladhara chakra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n self-awareness becomes more and more refined, Kundalini ascends in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sookshma sareera. As one has a perfect self-realization, Kunda=\r\nlini\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reaches\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sahasrara. Whether one thinks in these terms o=\r\nr not, Kundalini\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; moves based\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; on how evolved one is. Whether=\r\n one is into Bhakti yoga or Raja yoga\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; or Karma\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; yoga or Jnan=\r\na yoga does not matter. All paths lead to an awareness\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of a more\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; and more correct concept of self as time progresses and a full\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; self-realization finally. Accordingly, Kundalini rises more and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; m=\r\nore and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reaches Sahasrara at the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; During the=\r\n period when Kundalini is stuck in Swadhishthana chakra,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sexual\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; drive can multiply. Several yogis get stuck in this stage and fail\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; the tests\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to progress further. In general, women have a higher=\r\n drive than\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; men. If that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; drive multiplies, there can be a d=\r\nifficult situation. However, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; really\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; depends on the indiv=\r\nidual and we cannot generalize.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, there are some prac=\r\ntical difficulties on the way, which may\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; have made\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; some peo=\r\nple come up with some rules. However, are those issues\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sufficient to=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ban women from reciting Veda? I don&#39;t think so. In fact, the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; factors I wrote\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; above are probably irrelevant given the superfi=\r\ncial understanding\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Veda\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; present at this time and the sup=\r\nerficial recitation of Veda that we\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; find\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; these days.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; But, if you want to be sure and do not want to misguide anyone,=\r\n it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is better\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to not give any advice. Leave it to one&#39;s sad=\r\nguru. If you have a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sadguru who\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is guiding your spiritual s=\r\nadhana, surrender and do as your guru\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; says! What\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is good fo=\r\nr goose may not be good for gander. What goose&#39;s guru\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; taught to\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; goose may be good only for goose and not for gander. Gander will do\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; well to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; follow gander&#39;s guru.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I think I ram=\r\nbled enough for today... :-)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Naras=\r\nimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; From: &quot;rohinipurang&quot; =\r\n&lt;rohinipurang@ &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sen=\r\nt: Saturday, February 24, 2007 12:18 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] re=\r\nading/learning the veda\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;A warm namaste to every=\r\none!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I have heard it said that women are not allowed =\r\nto\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; read/know/recite the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; vedas.
