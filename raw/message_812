Since the \ntime I\n&gt; &gt; had been doing homa on =\r\na regular basis I had first started off \nwith\n&gt; &gt; an iron kunda, then an al=\r\numinium and finally shifted to a copper\n&gt; &gt; homa kunda. And in each cases, =\r\nI could feel some very papable\n&gt; &gt; effects.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When I was doing it in =\r\nan iron kunda for some days I would often \nget\n&gt; &gt; singed in the flames. On=\r\nce it was to quite an extent, such taht I\n&gt; &gt; had problems in walking for a=\r\n few days. This was after I had used\n&gt; &gt; the iron kunda for consequetive ho=\r\nmas for some days.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then I changed it and started using an Aluminuim=\r\n kunda which \nbecame\n&gt; &gt; dark and black with use. I had been using this alu=\r\nminum kunda for\n&gt; &gt; about a month and half regularly when some strange thin=\r\ngs started\n&gt; &gt; happening. There used to be some sort of infestation of ince=\r\nsts \nin\n&gt; &gt; my pooja room. One day I found a scorpion in my room! This was =\r\n\nquite\n&gt; &gt; strange since I had been living there for many months and now an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; never have I seen any before. Then came spiders. Now I am \ngenerally\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; scared of spiders. This had a strange psychological effect on my\n&gt; &gt; mi=\r\nnd, such that one day when I closed my eyes to meditate \ninfront of\n&gt; &gt; the=\r\n fire, I could just see spiders all around. And strangest of \nall,\n&gt; &gt; with=\r\nin a few days I got bitten by one! Never had I or anyone \nelse I\n&gt; &gt; knew, =\r\nhad known that spiders can bite. But this is a fact, cause \nI\n&gt; &gt; went thro=\r\nugh it and it is quite painful. It sort of left a small\n&gt; &gt; gaping wound on=\r\n my neck.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Then finally I shifted to a copper kunda and all such inc=\r\nidents\n&gt; &gt; stopped. Infact after using a copper kunda for sometime it \ncrea=\r\nted a\n&gt; &gt; marked feeling of lightness and joy. Very distinct and papable.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course if someone takes a hard rational stance, all this can \nbe\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; put down to coincidence. But I personally do not think so. Infact\n&gt; &gt; t=\r\nhese just proved the truth of Narasimhajis advice. Copper kundas\n&gt; &gt; are th=\r\ne best. Iron can increase effects of Shani in a person&#39;s \nlife\n&gt; &gt; and sadh=\r\nana. And Aluminium I believe is Rahu. The homa agni just\n&gt; &gt; amplified the =\r\neffects.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
