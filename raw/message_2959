This is not a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; matter of a few stray posts, but of one person who has made a=\r\n habit and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pattern, day after day after day, of=\r\n being rude and disrespectful towards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the other=\r\n members of this group.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Warm regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aditi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; On Mon, Oct 5, 2009 at 6:23 PM,\n yeeahoo_99 nitish.arya@ ... wrote:&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are man=\r\ny deluded souls like you who believe that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&quot;Adi Shankaracharya&quot; , &quot;Sri Ramana Maharishi&quot;, &quot;Sri Yukteswar&quot; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Paramhansa Yogananda&quot; didn&#39;t achieve Jnana in thi=\r\ns Age of Kali Yuga.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; What are you doing in a group on Vedic-wisdom, anyways ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wis=\r\ndom@ yahoogroups. com &lt;vedic-wisdom% 40yahoogroups. com&gt;,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;sbt_ravi&quot; sbt_ravi@ wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks and Good riddance=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We are not trying to be Jnaanis her=\r\ne as we know in this age of Kali Yuga&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it c=\r\nan not be achieved.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQ=\r\nUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-509983324-1256487920=:80018--\r\n\n"}}
