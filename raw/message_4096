He is running as a Republican.  Th=\r\ne election will be held on May 22, 2010.\n\nWhat makes John&#39;s candidacy quite=\r\n unique, and of special interest to the Hindu, Yoga, and Dharma communities=\r\n, is that John was born and raised in a devoted American Hindu family.  Joh=\r\nn is a lifelong dedicated yogi, vegetarian, environmentalist, and Hindu spi=\r\nritual practitioner.  John has, in fact, ingeniously incorporated into his =\r\nwell-formulated political and economic platform many principles that are de=\r\nrived directly from the philosophical worldview of Sanatana Dharma and Vedi=\r\nc culture!\n\nThere has never been a better time, place or platform for us to=\r\n test run Dharma-based policy proposals on the American political scene. Ou=\r\nr programs are the first generation of hybrid policy initiatives built to i=\r\nncorporate the wisdom of cultures past for a whole new set of insights and =\r\npossibilities today. \n\nPlease support John&#39;s campaign by visiting the websi=\r\ntes below.

You can be a part =\r\nof the potential transformation of history and of the political instantiati=\r\non of Dharma in your lifetime, and starting in Hawaii!\n\n\nhttp://www.faceboo=\r\nk.com/RaghuForCongress?ref=3Dmf\n\nhttp://www.createafund.com/RadhaRoopa/Radh=\r\naRoopa\n\nhttp://roopa.org/\n\n\n&quot;Be the change you wish to see in the world.&quot;  =\r\n- Mahatma Gandhi\n\n\n____________________________________\nYour Window to the =\r\nSpiritual Realm\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com\n\n\nPlease Forward.\n\n\n\n"}}
