I would be=\r\n obliged if anyone can share his/ her thoughts (or suggested reading materi=\r\nal) on this. \n\nThese days whenever I close my eyes even for a while I can s=\r\nee a purple color, sometimes even with a magenta combination.  To go a step=\r\n further, at times while talking to someone if I casually close my eyes I c=\r\nan his/ her image with all the red, orange, yellow & blue colors (something=\r\n like an aura). However, I do not see an image for each and every person. A=\r\nt certain times, I have seen colors for objects/ non-living beings too. And=\r\n at the same time I might not see anything with my eyes closed even when th=\r\ne room is full of people.  Splashing water on my face feels like spraying b=\r\nlue shades on red/magenta. Not sure, why this is and if it makes any sense.=\r\n\n\nIts been almost more than a month now and I am really curious to find out=\r\n the reason. Earlier, I even thought that I may have some problem with my e=\r\nyes. Generally, the only time I see these colors (especially purple & green=\r\n) is while meditating. To be honest, although I pray to God daily, I havent=\r\n been getting enough time to meditate regularly for the past few weeks.\n\nTh=\r\nank you.\n\nGargi\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
