It is very very difficult to burn a=\r\n watery coconut \n&gt; with just copra. You need wood. You should stick to half=\r\n/whole dry \n&gt; coconuts instead of watery coconuts.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I also use th=\r\ne same kind shown by Rajarshi ( http://goo.gl/U7vzW \n&gt; &lt;http://goo.gl/U7vzW=\r\n&gt; ). Though it is possible to offer the green ones ( \n&gt; http://goo.gl/2LMio=\r\n &lt;http://goo.gl/2LMio&gt; ), it will take a lot more \n&gt; time (or a much bigger=\r\n fire) to burn it fully.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I arrange two logs in parallel, separat=\r\ned by an inch or so, within my \n&gt; homa kundam. I place the coconut in the m=\r\niddle, on top of them. I offer \n&gt; it at the end of offerings to Ganapathi, =\r\nkind of like a poornaahuti to \n&gt; Ganapathi (I say &quot;OM gaM gaNapataye namaH,=\r\n pUrNa phalaM samarpayaami&quot;, \n&gt; i.e. I offer a whole fruit). Then I proceed=\r\n to invoke Chandi in the \n&gt; fire. By the time Chandi is invoked, the coconu=\r\nt fully cathes fire and \n&gt; there is a really big fire. Then I start making =\r\nofferings with \n&gt; Chandipath (sesame seeds, ghee etc). The way I arrange th=\r\ne two logs, \n&gt; they touch the firepit walls at the edges of the logs only a=\r\nnd they do \n&gt; not touch the bottom surface of the pit that contains burning=\r\n materials \n&gt; (e.g. sesame seeds, murmura, nuts, copra pieces etc). So, exc=\r\nept the \n&gt; edges, the logs are effectively suspended in air a little height=\r\n above \n&gt; the burning materials. That helps things burn nicely, with a big =\r\nfire. \n&gt; The coconut also burns fast and with a big fire.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; By the=\r\n time I am in the middle of the second chapter, the bottom of the \n&gt; coconu=\r\nt starts to crack. If I keep it a little more time, it will break \n&gt; and co=\r\nconut water will fall in fire. Before that happens, I turn the \n&gt; coconut a=\r\nround so that the weaker (cracked) side faces up. This way, \n&gt; water spills=\r\n in fire rarely. Usually most of the water just evaporates \n&gt; and only smal=\r\nl amounts spill into fire. IF a lot of water falls in fire, \n&gt; just pour so=\r\nme drops of ghee and sprinke sesame seeds to increase the \n&gt; fire again. By=\r\n the time I finish 13 chapters (sometimes even earlier), \n&gt; the coconut is =\r\nreduced to ashes. At the end, I offer a dry coconut as \n&gt; poornaahuti and m=\r\neditate peacefully. Dry coconut burns fully by itself, \n&gt; once it catches f=\r\nire.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I experimented with various whole fresh fruits, but coconut=\r\n is the best.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; In general, one simple thumbrule is that materials=\r\n need oxygen supply to \n&gt; burn well. So, if wood and coconut are exposed to=\r\n oxygen (air) from as \n&gt; many sides as possible, they will burn well and wi=\r\nth a big fire.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; This is just for giving some ideas to some people=\r\n who may be doing homam \n&gt; with a big fire.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Nara=\r\nsimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt; =C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; =\r\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n&gt; &lt;http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http=\r\n://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &lt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom \n&gt; &lt;http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings \n&gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyotis=\r\nhWritings&gt;\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Twitter ID: @h=\r\nomam108\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; On Tue, Mar 15, 2011 at 7:51 AM, vedic_pathak wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I understood which coconut you meant. act=\r\nually i once offered Coconut as \n&gt; purnahuti during my last visit to India =\r\nwhere in My native place, i had \n&gt; performed a chandi homam with lot of woo=\r\nds.

If that can be given in the fire, nothing=\r\n like it! \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Let me elaborate a bit more on the last portion of the bel=\r\now mail.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Normally we do a homa in a homa kunda which is placed on the=\r\n floor. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; The gap - physical distance - between the person doing the h=\r\noma and \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the kunda is not too big. In such circumstances it is good t=\r\no be a \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; little cautious while giving a full coconut.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0If someone has a fire pit dug, or the homa-kunda base is \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; re=\r\nsonably=C3=82=C2=A0below the surface level where one is sitting, that is \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; ideal for giving a coconut in fire.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0I used to give a=\r\n whole coconut (sometimes 2 coconuts)=C3=82=C2=A0in my \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; normal homa k=\r\nunda (16 inchx 16 inch). The coconut would take at \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; least one and hal=\r\nf hours to burn properly. I would use that time to \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; meditate, while p=\r\nouring ghee on the coconut at frequent intervals. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; But the coconut wi=\r\nll at one point spurt hot water. Normally it will \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; spray and=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0diffuse the fire,=C3=82=C2=A0so keep enough ghee and camphor \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; read=\r\ny!=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Sometimes however=C3=82=C2=A0the water may=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\nget=C3=82=C2=A0sprayed=C3=82=C2=A0on the body of the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; person. That is=\r\n why it is best if there is some reasonable gap \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; between the person a=\r\nnd the homa kunda, like in a fire pit. Prefer \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; large coconuts than sm=\r\naller ones. Large ones are easier to control \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in fire. Smaller coconu=\r\nts are more unpredictable.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; On a different note, I have had a fe=\r\nw occassions when coconuts have \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; burst uncomfortably in the kunda spr=\r\naying water on me. Once my face \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; got scalded such that I could not sh=\r\nave for a few weeks. However, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; the interesting thing is that the burs=\r\nting of a coconut and water \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; getting sprayed maybe uncomfortable and =\r\npainful, BUT invariable \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; it=C3=82=C2=A0sublimates some major karma th=\r\nat is coming. It is NEVER a radom \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; act. I have learnt through experie=\r\nnce.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; And coconut will produce a lot of smoke too. That is anoth=\r\ner factor \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; to be taken into account. However, all said and done, it i=\r\ns the best \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; offering one can make in fire. The effects are simply=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0amazing.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If you really want to take your homa experience to =\r\nthe next level, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; try full coconuts.

One of the nice subs=\r\ntances that one \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; can offer in homam fire is a whole fresh coconut. Th=\r\nough dry coconut \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (copra) can also be offered, normal fresh whole coc=\r\nonut with water \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in it is a fantastic material. Traditionally this is=\r\n what was \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; offered as poornaahuti (symbolic of head, i.e. ego).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n BTW, those who do homam with a small fire using dry coconut pieces \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nshould ignore this mail completely. Offering a whole fresh coconut \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; i=\r\nn fire is practical only for those who do homam with a big fire \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; usin=\r\ng logs of wood. You want to offer something only if you can \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; fully bu=\r\nrn it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; If a fresh coconut is offered in fire, it will take a while to=\r\n burn \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; completely, because it has layers (fiber, shell, white stuff a=\r\nnd \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; water etc, just like our own ego-consciousness!). If one offers i=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; in the end of homam, it will be a challenge to make it burn fully.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; One idea is to offer it in the beginning instead of the end, and \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; give it time to burn, as one goes through homam. I, for example, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n offer a fresh coconut in my daily homam at the end of offerings to \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nGanapathi at the beginning of homam. Then I invoke Chandi and offer \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nChandipath in fire with various offerings. During the course, the \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; fr=\r\nesh coconut burns fully and gets reduced to ashes by the end. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Having=\r\n offered a whole fresh coconut in homam daily for six months, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; I can =\r\ntell you that it is a very good idea (if and only if it is \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; practical=\r\n in your case).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; One risk is that coconut can break in a spot and hot =\r\nwater can gush \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; at you at a speed. Though that can be avoided with a =\r\nlittle \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; understanding of the dynamics, one should not do this if one =\r\nis \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; worried about the inhury.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Best regards, Narasimha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
