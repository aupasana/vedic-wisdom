It is really inside you, in your Heart, and the mo=\r\nment you effect\nsubsidence or merger of the mind into its Source, grace rus=\r\nhes forth,\nsprouting as from a spring within you.\n\nYour duty is to Be, and =\r\nnot to be this or that.\n\nSince you shine as &#39;&#39;I&#39;&#39; in the Heart, your name i=\r\ntself is Heart. ~ Sri\nRamana Maharshi\n\nIt does not matter how many thoughts=\r\n arise. As each thought arises, one\nshould inquire with diligence, &quot;To whom=\r\n has this thought arisen?&quot;\n\nThe mind is commonly said to be strong if it ca=\r\nn think furiously.

If it is external, it is\nus=\r\neless. All that is necessary is to know its existence in you.\n\nYou know tha=\r\nt you know nothing.\n\nWithout consciousness, time and space do not exist; th=\r\ney appear within\nConsciousness but have no reality of their own.\n\nWhen will=\r\n the realization of the Self be gained?

Maharshi: It is the state of\nunceasing peace of mind which is found in=\r\n the state of absolute quiescence.\n\nThe existence of this existence-conscio=\r\nusness can be inferred by the objects\nilluminated by it. It does not become=\r\n the object of consciousness.\n\nGuru is none other than the Self.

Do you know\nwhat you=\r\n are now?\n\nExistence or Consciousness is the only reality. Consciousness pl=\r\nus waking we\ncall waking. Consciousness plus sleep we call sleep. Conscious=\r\nness plus\ndream, we call dream. Consciousness is the screen on which all th=\r\ne pictures\ncome and go. The screen is real, the pictures are mere shadows o=\r\nn it.\n\n&quot;Only the knowledge of direct experience can be true and useful; the=\r\n Self is\nto be realized and not to be talked about.&quot; ~ The Lamp of Non-Dual=\r\n Knowledge\n\nTo the ignorant and the wise alike the world exists. To the for=\r\nmer, the\nworld observed alone is real. To the wise, the formless source of =\r\nthe\nvisible is the one world, Real and Perfect.&quot; ~ Sat-Darshana Bhashya\n\nYo=\r\nu know that you are.\n\n&quot;The Self is one and is identical with the Lord. In o=\r\nrder to see the Self or\nto see the Lord, the ego must get consumed and lost=\r\n, having surrendered\nitself to the Supreme Being.&quot; Truth Revealed (Sadvidya=\r\n)\n\n\nThe seat of Realization is within and the seeker cannot find it as an o=\r\nbject\noutside him. That seat is bliss and is the core of all beings. Hence =\r\nit is\ncalled the Heart.\n\nThe realized being does not see the world as diffe=\r\nrent from himself.\n\nMarried or unmarried, a man can realise the Self, becau=\r\nse that is here and\nnow. If it were not so, but attainable by some efforts =\r\nat some other time,\nand if it were new and something to be acquired, it wou=\r\nld not be worthy of\npursuit. Because what is not natural cannot be permanen=\r\nt either. But what I\nsay is that the Self is here and now and alone.\n\nBe wh=\r\nat you are. That which is, is ever present. Even now you are It, and\nnot ap=\r\nart from It. The expectation to see and the desire to get something\nare all=\r\n the working of the ego. Be yourself and nothing more.\n\n&quot;The changeless inf=\r\ninite Self transcends time and space, which are relative\nto the body and th=\r\ne mind.&quot; ~ Truth Revealed (Sadvidya)\n\nAll will come right in the end.\n\nA Se=\r\nlf-realised being cannot help benefiting the world. His very existence\nis t=\r\nhe highest good.\n\nIf the mind is turned inward God manifests as inner consc=\r\niousness.\n\nThe Heart is not physical; it is spiritual. Hridayam =3D hrit + =\r\nayam - This is\nthe centre. It is that from which thoughts arise, on which t=\r\nhey subsist and\nwhere they are resolved.\n\nSatisfaction can be only when you=\r\n reach the Source. Otherwise restlessness\nremains.\n\nThe conception that the=\r\nre is a goal and a path to it, is wrong. We are the\ngoal or peace always.\n\n=\r\nThe thing to do is to concentrate on the seer and not on the seen, not on\nt=\r\nhe objects, but on the Light which reveals them.\n\nGrace is ever present. Al=\r\nl that is necessary is that you surrender to It.\n\nThe body itself is a thou=\r\nght. Be as you really are.\n\nForgetfulness of your real nature is true death=\r\n;=E2=80=A8remembrance of it is\nrebirth.\n\nWhen you speak of a path, where ar=\r\ne you now?\n\nGuru is not the physical form. So the contact will remain even =\r\nafter the\nphysical form of the Guru vanishes.\n\nIf the light of the sun is i=\r\nnvisible to the owl, it is onlyquiry realize\nthat the mind which remains at=\r\n the end of the inquiry is Brahman.&quot; ~ Sri\nRamana Maharshi\n\nThere is no dif=\r\nference between the dream and the waking states except that\nthe dream is sh=\r\nort and the waking long. Both are the result of the mind. Our\nreal state, c=\r\nalled turiya (fourth), is beyond the waking, dream and sleep\nstates.\n\nRegul=\r\nation of life, such as getting up at a fixed hour, bathing, doing\nmantra, j=\r\napa, observing ritual, all this is for people who do not feel drawn\nto self=\r\n-enquiry or are not capable of it. But for those who can practise\nthis meth=\r\nod all rules and discipline are unnecessary.\n\nReality lies beyond the mind.=\r\n So long as the mind functions, there is\nduality. Once it is transcended, R=\r\neality shines forth.\n\nBirth and death pertain only to the body=E2=80=A6they=\r\n are superimposed on the Swe\nare free.\n\nThe fact of your existence is also =\r\nyour realization.\n\n&#39;I exist&#39; is the only permanent self-evident experience =\r\nof everyone.\n\nEventually, all that one has learnt will have to be forgotten=\r\n.\n\nDoesn&#39;t one find some kind of peace while in meditation? That is a sign =\r\nof\nprogress. That peace will become deeper and more prolonged with continue=\r\nd\npractice. It will also lead to the goal.\n\nOAM NAMO BHAGAVATE SRI RAMANAYA=\r\n\n\n&quot;Those who follow the path of inquiry realize that the mind which remains=\r\n at\ntheby this intense activity which is called &#39;silence&#39; (mauna).\n\nThere i=\r\ns no help in changing your environment.The obstacle is the mind,\nwhich must=\r\n be overcome, whether at home or in the forest.

If it were not so, but attainable by some =\r\nefforts at some other time, and if it were new and something to be acquired=\r\n, it would not be worthy of pursuit. Because what is not natural cannot be =\r\npermanent either. But what I say is that the Self is here and now and alone=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Be what you are. That which is, is ever present. Even now you are=\r\n It, and not apart from It. The expectation to see and the desire to get so=\r\nmething are all the working of the ego.
