If you have love and attachment for a deity and have a deep desire to worship that deity, move on to that deity.\n \n1. That&#39;s ok. The mantra at the end &quot;mantra heenam..&quot; is for this purpose only. As long as you do not intentionally mispronounce and you do the best job you can, you are fine.\n \n2. You need not start over, but just continue.\n \n3. Well, do the best you can and leave it to Her at the end.\n \n4. Yes to both a and b. But it is a good idea to make a few offerings (atleast 12) with the moola mantra. After 700 verses are done, offer the moola mantra in fire a few times with ghee. It is ok to do it directly without any nyasas again.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn this context, I want to state one thing. Not every person needs to do Chandi homam. Chandi is the fierce warrior goddess, who destroys weaknesses in sadhakas and takes them to realization fast. As the world is on an important inflection point and as dharma needs to increase, worship of Chandi in fire by several good sadhakas is needed in the world today (and it is slowly happening).\n \nHowever, for balance, we need good sadhakas worshipping other deities in fire too. For example, Ganapathi homam is a very important one. Vishnu Sahasra Naama Homam is another important one for dharma and peace in the world and I am afraid not many are doing that one. Instead of thinking of Chandi homam alone, I suggest that people should perform homam to a deity that they feel love and attraction to.\n \n*        *        *\n \nYou wrote in another mail:\n \n&gt; In all other homams soon after making the last offering with the final mantra we say vaushat. In Chandi homam after the final 700th verse should we say vaushat or swaha. \n&gt; \n&gt; Also the final line of the chapter 13 reads. \n&gt; &quot; Suryaj janm samasadhya savarnir bahvita manuh ll klim om ll &quot;\n&gt; Just confused, should I say swaha after manuh and after klim om also.\n \nYou can say &quot;vaushat&quot; after &quot;kleem om&quot;.\n\n&gt; The CHandi Path book that I have doesn&#39;t have dhyanam in the beginning of the chapters is it ok. Also dhyanam is followed soon after nyasa. When you say read the nyasa should we include the dhynam also.\n \nThat&#39;s ok. One custom is to take each chapter as a prayer to a different form of the Mother. Another custom is to take the three charitras to be prayers to different parts of the Mother and use a dhyaana sloka for each charitra. Another custom is to take the entire saptashati to be a prayer to the Mother and use a dhyaana at the beginning for praana pratisthaa alone.\n \n&gt; I want to read the kshama prarthna where can I include it. \n \nYou can do it before &quot;mantra heenam kriyaa heenam bhaktiheenam hutaashana&quot; verse.\n \n&gt; Thanks and Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Prm\n\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Priya M &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Respected Shri Narsimha garu , \n&gt;  \n&gt; I have been doing homam for the past 41/2 months and I want to know if I am ready for Chandi homam. To perform chandi homam how much weightage will you give to all these factors? \n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. I haven&#39;t still perfected on correct pronunciation. \n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. My kids sometimes disturb me during homam. Since this ritual will be a long one what if my kids disturb  will I have to start all over again. \n&gt;  \n&gt; 3. Its mentioned one shouldn&#39;t yawn or hold the book in hands while reading. I am a mother of two small kids and it will be impossible to perform under all these regulations. \n&gt;  \n&gt; 4. Manual pg 23 formalities question: \n&gt;  After reading the 700 verses \n&gt;  \n&gt; a) Can I read only the devi suktam (skip the nyasa and mantra) and continue with the punah pooja. \n&gt; b) Alternatively can I skip the formalities completely just like the introductory part and continue with the punah pooja..\n&gt;  \n&gt;  I started homam with an intention to remove black magic but I ended up being very spiritual and feel very connected to people here. I look upon you for guidance and will start only with your kind permission. \n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Prm\n\n\n"}}
