Pointing to the people\nsitting =\r\nthere,they said, =93They wanted us to do so and we have done it.=94 =93I\nse=\r\ne.\n\nWhat a great thing you have done! If they were feeling so very sultry i=\r\nt\nwould have been sufficient if only those fans where they are sitting had\n=\r\nbeen switched on. Why all this?=94 asked Bhagavan.\n\n=93They said that it wo=\r\nuld be very pleasant if all the fans were switched on,=94\nsaid the attendan=\r\nts. =93Is that so? What an amount of electric power will be\nconsumed by the=\r\nse fans! What a costly bill! Why this expense on our account?\nEnough, enoug=\r\nh. Stop that,=94 said Bhagavan.\n\n=93They are asking that they may be kept o=\r\nn until at least the Veda Parayana\nis over,=94 said Krishnaswami. =93Oh! Is=\r\n that so? They are rich people and so in\ntheir houses they can sit down wit=\r\nh fans whose use may cost ten times more\nthan this. Why should we have this=\r\n?\n\nWhy this show? The hand fan is there and the hands are there. Stop them\n=\r\nall,=94 said Bhagavan. At that, the attendants switched off all the fans\nex=\r\ncept the one above those people.\n\nDuring the early days of my stay here, i.=\r\ne. in 1941-42,someone brought an\nelectric fan and requested that it be used=\r\n by Bhagavan.\n\n=93Why this fan? The ordinary fan is there. We have hands. I=\r\n will fan myself\nwith it whenever necessary. Why do I require all these thi=\r\nngs?=94 said\nBhagavan.\n\n=93Is it not some trouble? If the electric fan is u=\r\nsed there is no trouble\nwhatsoever,=94 said that devotee. =93What is the tr=\r\nouble? If the ordinary fan is\nused we get just as much breeze as we want.\n\n=\r\nThe electric fan blows too much breeze and with a whizzing noise. Moreover,=\r\n\nsome electric current is consumed. For that,there will be a bill. Why shou=\r\nld\nwe make the office bear that expense on our account?=94 said Bhagavan.\n\n=\r\n=93We have got it here, Swami, with the permission of the office,=94 said t=\r\nhe\ndevotee. =93Oh, is that so? Then let them have the fan for themselves.\n\n=\r\nThey are people who work and it is necessary for them. Why should I need\nit=\r\n?=94 said Bhagavan. The devotee did not say anything further but went away,=\r\n\nleaving the fan\nthere.\n\nAs it was a table fan, it was kept near Bhagavan=\r\n=92s sofa and it used to be\nswitched on by someone nearby whenever it was s=\r\nultry.\n\nBhagavan would immediately say, =93It is only because of such thing=\r\ns I had\nsaid you should not keep it here at all. If you want a fan you can =\r\nkeep it\nnear yourselves.=94\n\nAnd if nobody stopped it he used to stop it hi=\r\nmself with the aid of a small\nstick.\n\nSource: Letters from Sri Ramanasramam=\r\n VOLUMES I, II & Letters from and\nRecollections of Sri Ramanasramam By SURI=\r\n NAGAMMA Translated by D.
