It cannot help you to know\nw=\r\nhat is beyond itself.\n\nD.: I understand it. But there is no happiness beyon=\r\nd it.\n\nM.: The intellect is the instrument wherewith to know unknown things=\r\n.But you\nare already known, being the Self which is itself knowledge;so you=\r\n do not\nbecome the object of knowledge. The intellect makes you see things =\r\noutside,\nand not that which is its own source.\n\nThe intellect is useful thu=\r\ns far, it helps you to analyse yourself, and no\nfurther. It must then be me=\r\nrged into the ego, and the source of the ego must\nbe sought. If that be don=\r\ne the ego disappears. Remain as that source and\nthen the ego does not arise=\r\n.\n\nD.: There is no happiness in that state.\n\nM.: =E2=80=98There is no happi=\r\nness=E2=80=99 is only a thought. The Self is bliss, pure and\nsimple. You ar=\r\ne the Self. So you cannot but be bliss; being so,you cannot\nsay here is no =\r\nhappiness. That which says so cannot be the Self; it is the\nnon-Self and mu=\r\nst be got rid of in order to realise the bliss of the Self.\n\nD.: How is tha=\r\nt to be done?\n\nM.: See wherefrom the thought arises. It is the mind. See fo=\r\nr whom the mind\nor intellect functions. For the ego. Merge the intellect in=\r\n the ego and seek\nthe source of the ego. The ego disappears. =E2=80=98I kno=\r\nw=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98I do not know=E2=80=99\nimply a subject and an objec=\r\nt. They are due to duality. The Self is pure and\nabsolute, One and alone. T=\r\nhere are no two selves so that one may know the\nother. What is duality then=\r\n?\n\nIt cannot be the Self which is One and alone. It must be non-Self.Dualit=\r\ny is\nthe characteristic of the ego. When thoughts arise duality is present;=\r\n know\nit to be the ego, and seek its source.\n\nThe degree of the absence of =\r\nthoughts is the measure of your progress\ntowards Self-Realisation. But Self=\r\n-Realisation itself does not admit of\nprogress; it is ever the same. The Se=\r\nlf remains always in realisation.\n\nThe obstacles are thoughts. Progress is =\r\nmeasured by the degree of removal of\nthe obstacles to understanding that th=\r\ne Self is always realised. So thoughts\nmust be checked by seeking to whom t=\r\nhey arise. So you go to their Source,\nwhere they do not arise.\n\nSource: Tal=\r\nks With Ramana Maharshi Book\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=\r\n=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016361375001276c6048c08e48b\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;1st February, 1939&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talk =\r\n618.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A gentleman from Hardwar:=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt:bold&quot;&gt;When I go on analysing myself I go beyond the intellect, and then t=\r\nhere is no happiness.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;M.: Intellect is only an instrument o=\r\nf the Self.
