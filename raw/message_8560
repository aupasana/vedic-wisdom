But with the real meaning. Not as 43 =\r\nlakh years but for me it can be anything from one year to 60 years for=C2=\r\n=A0I feel we can travel around this yuga system like Rohita, the son of Har=\r\nisih chandra did in his own life time. \n&gt;&gt;I=C2=A0believe in Dasa avatar as =\r\nthe guideline for us to evolve to our mokshya. Rama (7th incarnation of Tre=\r\ntata yuga), Krishna (8th incarnationof Dwapar yuga), Buddha (9th incarnatio=\r\nn of Kali yuga)=C2=A0and Kalki (tenth incarnation of satya yuga)=C2=A0are t=\r\nhe steps we have to travel throuh, satya, treta, dwapar and kali. It is my =\r\nbelief that one who is devoted can travel in sequence as the two Ayans and =\r\nthe two Solstices around the sun even in one year. So also like Rohita who =\r\ntravels around these four yugas as the act of walking, the act of standing =\r\nand the acts of sitting and sleeping. ( please refer Aitereya Brahman 33/15=\r\n). If you are devoted you can also do this in this lifetime itself like Roh=\r\nit did. You do not have to wait 43 lakhs of years..\n&gt;&gt;In the same manner we=\r\n can also do manawantar shift in this lifetime itself if you only have the =\r\nintellligence and the courage to do. Manawantar shift is\n already overdue.b=\r\necasuse the purnima zone of VE\n has already shifted.\n&gt;&gt;Hope I am imparting =\r\nsome=C2=A0 real meaning of our shastras. Even Vivekananda has confirmed thi=\r\ns fact.

Bad Dasa&quot; she was running into and attri=\r\nbutes her sorrow to &quot;Bad Dasa&quot;, They ( Kaul, Harimalla) are mischievously s=\r\npreading lie that Vedic religion is against Jyotish whereas Jyotish is part=\r\n of Vedangas.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;In Shantiparva of Mahabharta, Bhagwan Krishna counts J=\r\nyotish in the same list of Ved Shastras, this evidence is falsifying you (K=\r\naul, Harimalla) having study of only a few papers, basically written by oth=\r\ners, You should start reading Shanti Parva to learn the same and should hav=\r\ne respect for Bhagwan Sri Krishna, If you don&#39;t have that, you are not talk=\r\ning to keep up religion but trying to destroy it, And if you disbelief it, =\r\nyou need to produce counter evidence, SB Dixit was as ordinary as you or ha=\r\nrimalla are, i.e, no authority on any thing what you post, he was mere a te=\r\nacher not an educated acharya in vedic literature, only thing that he could=\r\n do was, only his elementary level book.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Was Surya only a teacher of=\r\n Maya : No, AK Kaul&#39;s proposition is fully wrong, Surya has taught various =\r\nVeda Shastras to Sri Hamnuman Ji, Sage Yagyavalka and 60,000 other sages.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Was other Gods also taught Jyotish To Seekers : Yes, Chandra taught J=\r\nyotish to Sage Shaunak and Brahma taught to Kashyap, references are documen=\r\nted and available but Kaul and harimalla doesn&#39;t know about it, so, it&#39;s th=\r\neir personal problem. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Was Surya Siddhanta against Kritikadi Samvats=\r\nar :\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;No, Unlike the propaganda without reading Surya Siddhanta compl=\r\netely you ( Kaul, Harimalla etc) said that Surya Siddhanta doesn&#39;t recogniz=\r\ne Vedic Kritikadi Nakshtra system, you are in full dark, you need to know a=\r\nt first that what&#39;s the Vedic Kritikadi Yuga System, If you read Surya Sidd=\r\nhanta to the end, you w&#39;d learn that for Brihaspati Yugas, Surya Siddhanta =\r\nmentions Kritika Nakshtra based in the same way Vedang Jyotish does, but, y=\r\nou guys since rooted in fallacy, couldn&#39;t see it in your 10+ yrs of anti jy=\r\notish agenda.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;In fact, Surya Siddhanta fills up that gap which has c=\r\nonfused our historians for long, our historians and so called scholars like=\r\n SB Dixit ( a college teacher ) could not understand that 5 years Yuga syst=\r\nem and religious Yuga system - Krita, Treta .. etc, are two different yuga =\r\nsystems and both systems are mentioned in almost all the Vedas and Brahmins=\r\n pertaining to Vedas, We have seen much of drama that Harimalla Ji and Kaul=\r\n Ji like people lacking knowledge has been making in group that Vedic Yuga =\r\nstarts only when Sun and Moon together moves on to Dhanistha, This is resul=\r\nt of half-knowledge..\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Is Surya Siddhata Against Vedic Religio=\r\nn : Never, In Surya Siddhanta Mayasur=C2=A0 begins with prayer to Brahma an=\r\nd ends with describing Vedic theory of Universe creation, mentioning Bhagwa=\r\nn Vishnu ( Anirudhha ) appeared before everything, refer to Bhugoladhya, Wh=\r\ny Mayasur doesn&#39;t refer to Greeko-Chaldean Myth if he was an imposter, an a=\r\nnti vedic, It&#39;s worth underlining that Mayasur admits that he is not Arya b=\r\nut still expresses his faith in Vedic system of religion. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Harim=\r\nalla And His Concoction of Yuga Periods: \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Though it&#39;s funny that a p=\r\nerson like you who claims doing calendar reform to protect religion, oppose=\r\ns the religious Chaturyga and Kalpas since, religious yuga measures derails=\r\n your theory of Manvantar Shift and Manvantar Duration, Funny is to read th=\r\nat Chaturyugasa\n re concoction but the Manvantar which higher unit of Chatu=\r\nryuga (71) is real, it all shows, a disguised liar, a conspirator in name o=\r\nf reformer or at least an ignorant person, Any ways, =C2=A0 For your knowle=\r\ndge and to destroy your fallacy that Chaturyuga Yugas are concoction \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;Keeping aside description of Kalpa given in multiple places in Rigveda an=\r\nd Chaturyuga as mentioned in Aiteryea Brahmin, there are further evidences =\r\nto Chaturyuga, Kalpa measure in Ramayana and Mahabharata too, Now you two (=\r\nKaul, Harimalla) open Mahabharta and read &quot;Moksha Dharma Parva&quot; which conta=\r\nins detailed account of all chaturyugas, explains increasing degeneracy of =\r\ndharma from Krita to Kali, saying for Krita there was no Yajans designated,=\r\n Yajans were designated from Treta and were running in Dwapar and in Kali, =\r\ndue to ignorance, Yajans won&#39;t happen.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Mokshra Dharm Parva clarifies=\r\n that 1000 Chaturygas are equal to one day of Brahma, Four thousand Eight H=\r\nundred Deva Varshas (including sandhi or junction period) are equal to one =\r\nKrita Yuga and in same fashion provides measure for other Yugas too, Same i=\r\ns mentioned in Manu&#39;s manusmriti, If you cast doubt on Manusmriti, You must=\r\n know that Manu is mentioned in many places in Rigveda also, start reading =\r\nand learn it.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;So, your tactics of spreading doubts on Yugas, shows, =\r\nyour are not following the religion but are trying to corrupt it or you hav=\r\ne no knowledge.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Lalit Mishra \n&gt;&gt;&gt;

Not as 43 lakh years but for me it can be anything from one year to 60 ye=\r\nars for&nbsp;I feel we can travel around this yuga system like Rohita, the =\r\nson of Harisih chandra did in his own life time. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font f=\r\nace=3D&quot;verdana,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;I&nbsp;believe in Dasa avatar as the g=\r\nuideline for us to evolve to our mokshya. Rama (7th incarnation of Tretata =\r\nyuga), Krishna (8th incarnationof Dwapar yuga), Buddha (9th incarnation of =\r\nKali yuga)&nbsp;and Kalki (tenth incarnation of satya yuga)&nbsp;are the st=\r\neps we have to travel throuh, satya, treta, dwapar and kali. It is my belie=\r\nf that one who is devoted can travel in sequence as the two Ayans and the t=\r\nwo Solstices around the sun even in one year. So also like Rohita who trave=\r\nls around these four yugas as the act of walking, the act of standing and t=\r\nhe acts of sitting and sleeping. ( please refer Aitereya Brahman 33/15). If=\r\n you are devoted you can also do this in this lifetime itself like Rohit di=\r\nd. You do not have to wait 43 lakhs of years..&lt;br&gt;In the same manner we can=\r\n also do manawantar shift in this lifetime itself if you only have the inte=\r\nllligence and the courage to do.

in which Bhagwan Ram asks Sugreeva, lakshma etc to=\r\n begin travels in auspecious Nakshtra, Maa Sita also at various places refe=\r\nrs to bad impact of &quot; Bad Dasa&quot; she was running into and attributes her sor=\r\nrow to &quot;Bad Dasa&quot;, They ( Kaul, Harimalla) are mischievously spreading lie =\r\nthat Vedic religion is against Jyotish whereas Jyotish is part of Vedangas.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;In Shantiparva of Mahabharta, &lt;/b&gt;Bhagwan Krishna counts Jyotish=\r\n in the same list of Ved Shastras, this evidence is falsifying you (Kaul, H=\r\narimalla) having study of only a few papers, basically written by others, Y=\r\nou should start reading Shanti Parva to learn the same and should have resp=\r\nect for Bhagwan Sri Krishna, If you don&#39;t have that, you are not talking to=\r\n keep up religion but trying to\n destroy it, And if you disbelief it, you n=\r\need to produce counter evidence, SB Dixit was as ordinary as you or harimal=\r\nla are, i.e, no authority on any thing what you post, he was mere a teacher=\r\n not an educated acharya in vedic literature, only thing that he could do w=\r\nas, only his elementary level book.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;verdana,helveti=\r\nca,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Was Surya only a teacher of Maya : &lt;/b&gt;No, AK Kaul&#39;s =\r\nproposition is fully wrong, Surya has taught various Veda Shastras to Sri H=\r\namnuman Ji, Sage Yagyavalka and 60,000 other sages.&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Was other God=\r\ns also taught Jyotish To Seekers : &lt;/b&gt;Yes, Chandra taught Jyotish to Sage =\r\nShaunak and Brahma taught to Kashyap, references are documented and availab=\r\nle but Kaul and harimalla doesn&#39;t know about it, so, it&#39;s their personal pr=\r\noblem. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;verdana,helvetica,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;br&gt;Was Su=\r\nrya Siddhanta against Kritikadi Samvatsar :&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;No, Unlike the propa=\r\nganda without reading Surya\n Siddhanta completely you ( Kaul, Harimalla etc=\r\n) said that Surya Siddhanta doesn&#39;t recognize Vedic Kritikadi Nakshtra syst=\r\nem, you are in full dark, you need to know at first that what&#39;s the Vedic K=\r\nritikadi Yuga System, If you read Surya Siddhanta to the end, you w&#39;d learn=\r\n that for Brihaspati Yugas, Surya Siddhanta mentions &lt;b&gt;Kritika Nakshtra ba=\r\nsed in the same way Vedang Jyotish does&lt;/b&gt;, but, you guys since rooted in =\r\nfallacy, couldn&#39;t see it in your 10+ yrs of anti jyotish agenda.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;=\r\nIn fact, Surya Siddhanta fills up that gap which has confused our historian=\r\ns&lt;/b&gt; for long, our historians and so called scholars like SB Dixit ( a col=\r\nlege teacher ) could not understand that 5 years Yuga system and religious =\r\nYuga system - Krita, Treta .. etc, are two different yuga systems and both =\r\nsystems are mentioned in almost all the Vedas and Brahmins pertaining to Ve=\r\ndas, We have seen much of drama that Harimalla Ji and Kaul Ji like people l=\r\nacking knowledge has\n been making in group that Vedic Yuga starts only when=\r\n Sun and Moon together moves on to Dhanistha, This is result of half-knowle=\r\ndge..&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Is Surya Siddhata Against Vedic Religion :&lt;/b&gt; Never=\r\n, In Surya Siddhanta Mayasur&nbsp; begins with prayer to Brahma and ends wi=\r\nth describing Vedic theory of Universe creation, mentioning Bhagwan Vishnu =\r\n( Anirudhha ) appeared before everything, refer to Bhugoladhya, Why Mayasur=\r\n doesn&#39;t refer to Greeko-Chaldean Myth if he was an imposter, an anti vedic=\r\n, It&#39;s worth underlining that Mayasur admits that he is not Arya but still =\r\nexpresses his faith in Vedic system of religion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Harimalla A=\r\nnd His Concoction of Yuga Periods&lt;/b&gt;: &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Though it&#39;s funny that a per=\r\nson like you who claims doing calendar reform to protect religion, opposes =\r\nthe religious Chaturyga and Kalpas since, religious yuga measures derails y=\r\nour theory of Manvantar Shift and Manvantar Duration, Funny is to read that=\r\n Chaturyugasa\n re concoction but the Manvantar which higher unit of Chatury=\r\nuga (71) is real, it all shows, a disguised liar, a conspirator in name of =\r\nreformer or at least an ignorant person, Any ways, &nbsp; For your knowledg=\r\ne and to destroy your fallacy that Chaturyuga Yugas are concoction &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nKeeping aside description of Kalpa given in multiple places in Rigveda and =\r\nChaturyuga as mentioned in Aiteryea Brahmin, there are further evidences to=\r\n Chaturyuga, Kalpa measure in Ramayana and Mahabharata too, Now you two (Ka=\r\nul, Harimalla) &lt;b&gt;open Mahabharta and read &quot;Moksha Dharma Parva&quot;&lt;/b&gt; which =\r\ncontains detailed account of all chaturyugas, explains increasing degenerac=\r\ny of dharma from Krita to Kali, saying for Krita there was no Yajans design=\r\nated, Yajans were designated from Treta and were running in Dwapar and in K=\r\nali, due to ignorance, Yajans won&#39;t happen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mokshra Dharm Parva c=\r\nlarifies that 1000 Chaturygas are equal to one day of Brahma&lt;/b&gt;, Four thou=\r\nsand\n Eight Hundred Deva Varshas (including sandhi or junction period) are =\r\nequal to one Krita Yuga and in same fashion provides measure for other Yuga=\r\ns too, Same is mentioned in Manu&#39;s manusmriti, If you cast doubt on Manusmr=\r\niti, You must know that Manu is mentioned in many places in Rigveda also, s=\r\ntart reading and learn it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So, your tactics of spreading doubts on Y=\r\nugas, shows, your are not following the religion but are trying to corrupt =\r\nit or you have no knowledge.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Lalit Mishra &lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbo=\r\ndy&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;=\r\n&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
