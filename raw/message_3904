If priest was aware and still did that, then I can\n&gt; &gt; understand t=\r\nhe consequence.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one goes in the path of a tornado, aware or unaware=\r\n that a tornado is coming, one will still be consumed by it.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the qu=\r\nestion is of fairness, well, is it fair that tornadoes, earthquakes, hurric=\r\nanes etc should kill thousands of people every year? Well, Natural order of=\r\n the universe is neither fair nor unfair. It is just an &quot;order&quot;. Your actio=\r\nns gets opposite reactions. You experience the fruits of your actions, as d=\r\netermined by the order of nature. A person may happen to be doing what he s=\r\nees as his dharma and earthquake may strike there and kill him. If so, ther=\r\ne must be a previous karma as a result of which he is placed there at that =\r\ntime.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the case of the priest in the story, his mistake is that he s=\r\nlapped a person worshipping god. If he had no way of assessing the bhava (f=\r\neeling) in the mind of the person doing the worship, he should&#39;ve given the=\r\n benefit of doubt and assumed it was a sincere devotee, rather than assumin=\r\ng it was a fool.\n&gt; \n&gt; See, when Ramakrishna went there and saw Trilinga Swa=\r\nmi, he immediately knew the stature and remarked that this is Viswanatha hi=\r\nmself. However, others may not be so fortunate. You only saw a body with so=\r\nme body parts and some clothes and nothing beyond it. If so, give the benef=\r\nit of doubt and treat kindly and respectfully. Just because of external par=\r\nameters, do not judge a person and act harsh.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hitting a person who sti=\r\nll has a limited self-identification is one thing and hitting a person who =\r\nhas no limited self-identification and identifies with the entire universe =\r\nor with a deity is different.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, do not worry abo=\r\nut that priest that much. For all you know, he may be an associate of Shiva=\r\n who came along with Trilinga Swami to enact a story and teach a moral and =\r\nhe may have gone back to Shiva. Even if not, he was lucky to enact an impor=\r\ntant role in an interesting divine drama.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeevanmuktas may =\r\nengage in actions that are difficult to comprehend. They have no personal e=\r\ngo, will and agenda. They become instruments for Nature to fulfil the Natur=\r\nal order. The action of Trilinga Swami may help several people question, ch=\r\nallenge and overcome their biases and learn some important lessons, centuri=\r\nes after he left earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding many gods: As I keep emph=\r\nasizing, yogis and saints sometimes give advices based on desa-kaala-paatra=\r\n or advices geared at a specific set of people.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is nothing wrong=\r\n in having many deities in pooja room and worshipping all. Such people may =\r\nlead fruitful dharmik lives. However, Vimalananda may not be concerned abou=\r\nt such people. His teachings may be addressed at some other people to come =\r\nin the coming years who he has rina with and who are meant to achieve saayu=\r\njya of some deities and do some work. There is an intended audience for eve=\r\nry work and no work can be perfect for all audience.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the goal is ei=\r\nther liberation or a deity&#39;s darshan (vision) or saayujya (company), one ha=\r\ns to agree that focusing on one deity is the best thing to do, rather than =\r\ntrying to focus mind on ten deities and keep switching. A deity comes when =\r\nmind and its thoughts are filled with that deity&#39;s name and mantra and othe=\r\nr thoughts are driven away from the mind. Vimalananda perhaps wanted to mot=\r\nivate several people to strive for vision/company of deities. He probably t=\r\nhought some people he has a rina with would come to earth with such a poten=\r\ntial.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Thyagaraja did compose songs on many deities. But, he=\r\n first had a darshan of Rama. He spent several years chanting Rama&#39;s name a=\r\nnd had a darshan. Then he composed songs on many deities. However, he saw a=\r\nll of them as different emanations from Rama. He saw Rama in all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Same=\r\n with Aadi Shankara, Muththuswamy Deekshitar, Bammera Pothana and others.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; When one achieves perfection in surrender to one deity, one&#39;s life is m=\r\nade. After that, one will see the same deity in all deities even if he wors=\r\nhips 100 deities. If one is switching between ten deities before that, it m=\r\nay not be helpful in filling the mind with thoughts of any of those deities=\r\n. Mind sees those deities as different objects and may not fully surrender =\r\nto any of them. Still, as I said, one may lead a fruitful dhaarmik life. Th=\r\nat&#39;s fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, if you really want to taste the nectar of complete sur=\r\nrender, it is better to pick one deity and fill the mind with his/her thoug=\r\nhts.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Excellent answers on each thread and mother showed h=\r\ner divine\n&gt; &gt; grace through you that I am able to find answers to many\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nquestions that my immature mind keeps on asking! \n&gt; \n&gt; Though I had some sp=\r\niritual experiences fortunately, I am not a realized person.

I do understand that Telang Swamy might have been a great yogi but my =\r\npoint is how are we to understand that greatness and in that context what i=\r\ns ununsual in the priest&#39;s reaction that God had to punish him that hard! I=\r\nf priest was aware and still did that, then I can understand the consequenc=\r\ne. I haven&#39;t yet the second book though! Probably that will explain. \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Also, I understand RamaKrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s famous &#39;Dig at one place =\r\n10 feet instead of 1 foot at 10 places if you want to find water&#39;. But cont=\r\nrary to that we find great saints / composers / poets from India have indee=\r\nd worshipped many forms of the God and were successful in that approach as =\r\nwell. For instance, there is not a single deity form that was not worshippe=\r\nd by Adi Sankara and/or Muththuswamy Dikshitar. It was famous that Muththus=\r\nwamy Dikshitar was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka and he left his mortal c=\r\noil by singing to Madurai MeenakshiDevi in the presence of many of his disc=\r\niples. But he composed songs of deep devotion that have immense power and d=\r\nepth on Lord Shiva, Ganesha, Subramanya, Rama and so on. So was Thyagaraja.=\r\n So were many great composers of Carnatic Music in that path. In fact they =\r\nwere all great advaitis and never saw any difference between any form of th=\r\ne God, what soever. Bammera Pothana, a great poet of Andhra who\n&gt; &gt; transla=\r\nted Bhagavatam, in his opening invocatory poems, pays homage to Lord Vishnu=\r\n, Shiva, Brahma, Ganesha, Saraswati, Brahmi, Durga, Lakshmi in that order b=\r\nefore declaring that he got the divine inspiration from Lord Rama to write =\r\nthe Stories of Krishna! Where is the difference between any form of God her=\r\ne! I wonder. So, I was not able to comprehend why Vimalananda accuses many =\r\nHindus of having a chaotic mind just because their puja mandirams are fille=\r\nd with many photographs/ idols of different murthis of Almighty.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; N=\r\nagraj \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhagaru, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Excellent answers on each th=\r\nread and mother showed her divine grace through you that I am able to find =\r\nanswers to many questions that my immature mind keeps on asking! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nAnyway, coming back to the topic, some of the topics I found disturbing in =\r\nthe first book of Aghora are as follows: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. On the page 45 it say=\r\ns that Telang swami performed the ritual bath of Kashi Vishveshwara with hi=\r\ns own urine and feces. What could be the compelling reason for this bizarre=\r\n behavior and why should the priest who slapped him die, because in my opin=\r\nion, anyone else would have done the same in the least! Since you have an e=\r\nxcellent way to explain many seemingly disturbing things, I hope to find an=\r\nd answer here. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. In quite a few places, Vimalananda equates chan=\r\nging the loyalty from diety to diety as akin to prostitution, which I find =\r\nas an extreme view! If that were true, why would Adi Sankara compose so man=\r\ny hymns in praise of so many dieties, Thyagaraja composed in the praise of =\r\nSri Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaganmata as well. So are so many gre=\r\nat composers / poets. The examples of Tulasidas and Leelashuka where they w=\r\nanted to see their favorite deity form only (rama in the case of former and=\r\n krishna in the case of latter) despite knowing that the other form is the =\r\nsame supreme being, are only a very minority in the list of Bhaktas that we=\r\n have? Why this kind of a view. I see myself being equally in the love and =\r\nawe of every form of god, namely Shiva, rama, krishna, ganesha, amba, subra=\r\nmanya, anjaneya and so on! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nagraj \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 3/2/10, N=\r\narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PV=\r\nR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Surrender (Re: Aghora =\r\nbooks..)\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, March 2,=\r\n 2010, 6:31 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; How to=\r\n achieve it effectivey?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If it can be achieved easily, we will not =\r\nhave so many spiritual paths and so many sadhanas.

Otherwise, Arjuna could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have written off the=\r\n wrongs of the Kauravas as a massive rnu, but of course,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna =\r\nurged him to take up the dharma of kshatriyahood and slay without\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n mercy. The webs of karma are too intricate and complex and delicate to be\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comprehended unless one has reached certain very very high levels=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual attainment, and even then, it will only be a partia=\r\nl vision.

He did so mu=\r\nch sadhana of a deity that this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deity began to occupy him day and=\r\n night. This deity was a form of Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That in turn gave him the=\r\n rarest of rare opportunity to be with Krishna at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time of the=\r\n battle, because Shiva is the greatest Vaishnava, the only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one wh=\r\no knows how to worship Krishna properly. Only by becoming Shiva\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; y=\r\nourself can you worship Krishna perfectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, at the=\r\n time of the battle, Arjun was beset with doubt, but when he saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthe Viswharoopa something crazy happened as if Krishna was within him. Of\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course Krishna was present even before, but Arjun could not percei=\r\nve Him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; properly. this was Krishna&#39;s lila or play of course, becau=\r\nse otherwise would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun have treated him as a friend ever??!!(sl=\r\napping Him on the back,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; playing tricks on Him, but the Lord loves=\r\n to play with His genuine devotees)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, now once Arjun=\r\n&#39;s remnant personality was further effaced and replaced by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishn=\r\na in his form as Kaala Viswharoopa, then it was effectively Krishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; who destroyed the Kauravas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why at the end of the batt=\r\nle when all the Pandavas went to ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person who had been deca=\r\npitated by Krishna&#39;s Sudarshana but who was still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kept alive at t=\r\nhe top of the tree,..... about who was responsible for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pandav=\r\na&#39;s victory..... ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that man said was that at the beginning=\r\n of the day he could see the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sudarshana start out from one end of=\r\n the battlefield, then having done all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that destruction, it would=\r\n return to krishna&#39;s hand at the end of the day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the blood wh=\r\nich was being spilt was drunk by Krishna Shakti or Kali.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Arjun was lucky, He had God incarnate at His side, others may not be qui=\r\nte\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so fortunate. For example, Ramakrishna used to say that a doct=\r\nor&#39;s money was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blood and pus (I left my thriving surgical career =\r\nwhen I read this a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years ago).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He said something si=\r\nmilar about the money earned by a lawyer.(I think he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; referrin=\r\ng to criminal law in that time).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Easiest thing to do i=\r\ns Ishwar(Ishwari) pranidhana.

The time then was such that there was too much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tremendous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and civiliza=\r\ntion destroyed to a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extent,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali=\r\n yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warrior,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply lov=\r\ned and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dharma=\r\n to kill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was born ag=\r\nain in the 19th century as one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s =\r\nsishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous life, =\r\naccording to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despi=\r\nte his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a =\r\nmonk and inspire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generations to embrace a simple life of ment=\r\nal detachment and service to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others. When he is born again (w=\r\nhich he has to, as per what Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said), his dharma bas=\r\ned on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky question is: How does one dec=\r\nide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some people have inte=\r\nrpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism=\r\n for a long time, the concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility w=\r\nas very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing=\r\n birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and=\r\n and a maharshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. =\r\nOne starts off with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; varna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of father, because =\r\nthat is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; develops =\r\nin life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you t=\r\no know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. More=\r\nover, there are not just 4 dharmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the world. =\r\nEach person has individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what=\r\n one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nenough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is=\r\n surrounded by a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noise from other parts of our minds w=\r\nhich tell other things. Thus, we get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment combining discrimination and=\r\n intuition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is our dharma and foll=\r\now it sincerely. We may be err, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the bes=\r\nt we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More than follo=\r\nwing dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; act=\r\nions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We=\r\n should engage in the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible actions (based on our bes=\r\nt judgment on what our dharma in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situat=\r\nion is), with as little attachment and self-identification with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;=\r\nwhat will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of =\r\nnishkama karma yoga (unfication through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; untached action) will=\r\n simplify our ego and purify our consciousness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clearer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a positive feedback here. This wi=\r\nll slowly enable us to see our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly and follow it w=\r\nithout incurring new karmas. This is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bu=\r\nt not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bottoml=\r\nine is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages =\r\nin action with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellec=\r\nt and intuition are the inputs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another external input is the=\r\n words of scriptures and learned men. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; der=\r\nive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\npiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one=\r\n can take the words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the master to determine on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Arjuna=\r\n was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gur=\r\nus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who=\r\n clarified his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) =\r\nwas confused about his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wanted to renou=\r\nnce the world and go to a secluded place to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who is not in tune with nature and does no=\r\nt know who one is, what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debts are and what =\r\nnature expects from one can err in the judgment of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insi=\r\nght\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give p=\r\nerfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person =\r\nto person,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to time and from place to pl=\r\nace.

By doing various =\r\nkinds of spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engagi=\r\nng in actions without much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attachment, one can slowly purify =\r\noneself and refine one&#39;s understanding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s i=\r\nndividual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to persist so lo=\r\nng as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi Banerjee &lt;ban=\r\nerjeea@gmail. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree with Dinesh.

In=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beginning, he may still distract you and make it more diff=\r\nicult to read.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, it is possible that he also likes the book =\r\nand starts enjoying the book\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; along with you and stops distracti=\r\nng you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=C6=\r\n=92?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; If meditation is like reading a book, weakness for=\r\n sex is like the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friend and sexual thoughts that arise in the m=\r\nind are like the distractions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caused by the friend, then aghora=\r\n&#39;s sadhana I mentioned is like getting the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friend to read the b=\r\nook along with you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=83=C6=92?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, as I said, there are no guarant=\r\nees. This friend may get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in the book and stop distra=\r\ncting you, or he may continue to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distract you and make it worse=\r\n by being right next to you through the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reading. It is tricky t=\r\no know how long one should try before deciding that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is not w=\r\norking.

If feces=\r\n and fruit are both impermenant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions and the only permanen=\r\nt reality within them is the Self, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions why he can eat =\r\nfruit but not feces.
