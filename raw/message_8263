What you call first stage is dominated by tamas, with some rajas too. =\r\nWhat you call the second stage is dominated by rajas, with some tamas too. =\r\nWhat you call the third stage is dominated by satta, with some rajas too.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nThis can be further broken down as follows:\n=C2=A0\n(1) Mostly tamas:=\r\n Does not think about spiritual sadhana or progress. May fear god and go to=\r\n temple or see/do poojas now and then.\n(2) Mostly tamas, with some rajas: E=\r\nngages in some sadhana. But the ignorance and attachments bring fears, worr=\r\nies, anxieties, doubts etc. As tamas reduces and rajas increases, doubts an=\r\nd fears are allayed to some extent, some direction is found and there is mo=\r\nre focused effort.\n(3) Mostly rajas, some tamas: Engages in a lot of sadhan=\r\na, but still has some misconceptions and doubts in mind. As tamas reduces, =\r\ndoubts and misconceptions reduce.\n(4) Mostly rajas, some sattwa: Engages in=\r\n a lot of sadhana and focus and clarity of thinking starts to set in. As sa=\r\nttwa increases, one&#39;s thinking, vision and focus become clearer.\n(5) Mostly=\r\n sattwa, some rajas: Weaknesses that troubled earlier start to trouble less=\r\n and there is mental clarity. There is still some passion, attachment and r=\r\nesultant internal stress (i.e. resisting divine will or the fruits of previ=\r\nous karmas), which reduces as rajas reduces.\n(6) Mostly sattwa: Clear visio=\r\nn, nice focus of mind in sadhana, very good acceptance of divine will (frui=\r\nts of previous karmas) and flowing with the divine rhythm.\n=C2=A0\nThere can=\r\n be several other abstractions to look at stages in sadhana. Vasishtha desc=\r\nribes some in Yoga Vaasishtham.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nOne importan=\r\nt thing to note is that sadhana and spiritual progress are not something to=\r\n flaunt. If one is in stage 2 or 3, it is nothing to be ashamed of and one =\r\nneed not pretend otherwise. The most important thing is to be honest intern=\r\nally. If there are doubts and anxieties, there is no point in suppressing t=\r\nhem. They should be addressed in the earnest. A proper and natural evolutio=\r\nn of understanding comes with time to everyone. Pretensions of being someon=\r\ne one is not and forceful suppression of misunderstandings does not help in=\r\n the long run.\n=C2=A0\nSecondly, one need not spend a fixed amount of time i=\r\nn each stage. Some people make fast progress and some people take more time=\r\n. If God wills, one can become liberated in a second. So don&#39;t worry wherev=\r\ner you are in terms of these &quot;stages&quot;.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nBTW, w=\r\nhat you say of &quot;external experiences&quot; applies to &quot;internal experiences&quot; as =\r\nwell. After all, mind (especially an imaginative one) is capable of &quot;manufa=\r\ncturing&quot; over time whatever it fancies. Some experiences can be hallucinati=\r\nons. Even when not, they can reinforce some unneeded conditioning. I am not=\r\n just talking about beginners, but even highly evolved sadhakas.\n=C2=A0\nFor=\r\n example, there have been several elevated yogis claiming to be the reincar=\r\nnations of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. They may all have genuinely believed it=\r\n and not trying to deceive anyone. If one&#39;s mind nurtured a secret desire t=\r\no be somebody important and if one likes Ramakrishna, it is possible to exp=\r\nerience an internal vision suggesting that one is a reincarnation of Ramakr=\r\nishna.\n=C2=A0\nLet me give a subtler example. I was once discussing the mean=\r\ning of &quot;Mantra Pushpam&quot; here (see http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm/message/7015). A learned yogi wrote to me that it was about denser elemen=\r\nts dissolving in lighter elements as Kundalini ascends and denser elements =\r\ncoming back from lighter elements as Kundalini descends. When I pointed out=\r\n weaknesses in that interpretation, he told me that that was the *vision* (=\r\ninternal experience) he got when he meditated with it. However, that absolu=\r\ntely does not add up. What is described in Mantra Pushpam is not chain of X=\r\n merging in Y, Y merging in Z, etc. Moreover, all elements are not covered.=\r\n Moreover, water is common, i.e. X lies in water, water lies in X; Y lies i=\r\nn water, water lies in Y, and so on. That is different from dissolution and=\r\n creation of elements as happens when Kundalini ascends and descends.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nHowever, I can believe that that yogi may have indeed gotten the vision=\r\n as he claimed. When one looks at a verse (or any other notion or idea), on=\r\ne&#39;s rational mind may consciously or sub-consciously come up with an intell=\r\nectual understanding. If an imaginative and focused mind meditates then, it=\r\n may indeed experience a corresponding vision! It is all a play of mind and=\r\n of no significance. Not every internal experience of even an elevated yogi=\r\n who genuinely experienced aspects of divine (but not yet liberated) may me=\r\nan something.\n=C2=A0\nKnowing which internal experience is a result of some =\r\nconditioning, some desire or some rational/emotional notion still present i=\r\nn the mind, is not easy, even for good and sincere sadhakas.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nExternal and internal experiences cannot be avoided as one =\r\ndoes sadhana. Depending on one&#39;s conditioning, one may experience many thin=\r\ngs.\n=C2=A0\nWhether an experience is external or internal is not IMHO the ma=\r\nin thing. Both can be useful in some cases and increase faith and confidenc=\r\ne or give clarity of thinking, and trigger positive internal transformation=\r\n. Both can be detrimental in some cases and increase pride or reinforce som=\r\ne wrong notions, and delay positive internal transformation or even trigger=\r\n negative internal transformation.\n=C2=A0\nVasishtha&#39;s guidance is very clea=\r\nr. Neither seek nor avoid experiences (which are like roadside trees as one=\r\n travels on a hilly road to the top of the hill). Keep the mind focused on =\r\nsadhana to the best of your ability.\n=C2=A0\nThough I said it before, I will=\r\n say this again, because it is worth saying many times:\n=C2=A0\nThe only wor=\r\nthwhile measure of spiritual progress and the only experience worth longing=\r\n is the internal experience of detachment. If one experiences less stress i=\r\nn situations that would&#39;ve stressed one before, if one experiences less ang=\r\ner in situations that would&#39;ve angered one before, if one experiences less =\r\nlust in situations that would&#39;ve made one lusty before, if one experiences =\r\nless jealosy in situations that would&#39;ve made one jealous before, and so on=\r\n, then one is making progress.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish =\r\nSoftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual m=\r\nanuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a differ=\r\nence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 Twitter ID: @homam108\n----------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0\nOn Thu, May 10, 2012 at 2:57 PM, rajar=\r\nshi14 wrote:\n\nThree stages of sadhana, as I see it. Purely my own observati=\r\nons. Not points of debate. Everyone is free to disagree. \n\n1st stage of Sad=\r\nhana: Try out scoops of everything, hanging on to solicited or unsolicited =\r\nadvice from anywhere and everwhere, and eventually moving in confused circl=\r\nes, feeling proud and happy about the fact that, yes I am doing something c=\r\nalled sadhana while many others are not. The mind lies in the communal stag=\r\ne (communal =3D anyone one who mentally identifies to a community not neces=\r\nsarily in a religious sense), trying to find a community of similar minded =\r\nindividuals and hang on to the same in a subconscious attempt to define its=\r\nelf. \n\n2nd stage of Sadhana: Get bits and pieces of &quot;experiences&quot; in an ext=\r\nernal format which the mind correlates to the process of sadhana and either=\r\n feels happy, or dejected. Soon it gets boring, for none of these so called=\r\n external &quot;experiences&quot; are consistent or even replicable at will. Doubts s=\r\ntart creeping, boredom sets in, confusions galore, and some fall back to st=\r\nage 1 described above. \n\n3rd stage: One realizes the absolute futility of t=\r\nhe external experiences compared to what is happening inside, if at all any=\r\nthing is happening. Until a transformation process triggers inside the mind=\r\n, all of it is meaningless. The external world may crack open and 33 millio=\r\nns deities may dance infornt, yet it eventually counts for nothing if it is=\r\n not able to still the &quot;monkey-mind&quot; and make the sadhaka enjoy a concentra=\r\nted feeling of internal joy. This joy will overflow into other secular acti=\r\nvities and thoughts, it&#39;s so powerful and dynamic in nature. One who is fir=\r\nmly established in this stage, will never bother too much about the externa=\r\nl ritual, its source, its accuracy etc. He/she does not shun external ritua=\r\nls, but he/she realizes that the real barometer for judging the efficacy of=\r\n a sadhana is inside the mind and heart. This is the beginning of the &quot;alon=\r\ne&quot; phase. Alone, but not lonely. In loneliness one craves for external vali=\r\ndation, in being\n alone one needs no validation apart from his/her own joy.=\r\n \n\nAs such, if this person were to meet another sadhaka, the only worthy in=\r\nformation he/she will try to extract is what has the other person experienc=\r\ned internally, and be least bothered about what path he/she walks and which=\r\n deity he/she is trying to worship. Fancy names and theoretical classificat=\r\nions do not impress him/her anymore. \n\nFrom here starts the real journey. B=\r\nefore that, stage 1 and stage 2 is like a kindergarten attitude. So each sa=\r\ndhaka must ask himself/herself objective, where does he/she stand and where=\r\n is he/she headed! \n \r\n---814770868-890978357-1337374001=:33363\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ve=\r\nrdana, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Your are right.

As a parameter for=\r\n judgement spiritual depth, it does not mean much. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;Rajarsh=\r\ni&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_224_133736335442769&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:1=\r\n0pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;\n face=3D&quot;Times=\r\n New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#000066=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=\r\n=3D&quot;#a2a2a2&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:=\r\n#000066;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font=\r\n size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#a2a2a2&quot;&gt;Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mere aage&lt;=\r\n/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-spa=\r\nn&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#000066;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nsize: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#000099;&quot;&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: 13px;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=\r\n=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-st=\r\nyle-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#999999;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Ek khel hain aurang-e-s=\r\nulemaan mere\n nazdeek&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=\r\n=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size: 16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-st=\r\nyle-span&quot; style=3D&quot;COLOR:#999999;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Ek baat hain ijaz-e-mas=\r\niah mere aage.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/stro=\r\nng&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: ver=\r\ndana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: =\r\ntimes new roman, new york, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr=\r\n&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Satur=\r\nday, 12 May 2012 8:30 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] RE: Stages of Sadhana&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv id=3D&quot;yiv1196136215&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1196136215ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      =\r\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Nam=\r\naste Rajarshi,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=\r\n=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;What you are describing is essenti=\r\nally evolution of gunas.

Vasishtha describes some in Yoga Vaasis=\r\nhtham.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verd=\r\nana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000=\r\n00&quot;\n face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;L=\r\nEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;On=\r\ne important thing to note is that sadhana and spiritual progress are not so=\r\nmething to flaunt. If one is in stage 2 or 3, it is nothing to be ashamed o=\r\nf and one need not pretend otherwise. The most important thing is to be hon=\r\nest internally. If there are doubts and anxieties, there is no point in sup=\r\npressing them. They should be addressed in the earnest. A proper and natura=\r\nl evolution of understanding comes with time to everyone. Pretensions of be=\r\ning someone one is not and forceful suppression of misunderstandings does n=\r\not help in the long run.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00=\r\n0000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;\n face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Secondly, one need not s=\r\npend a fixed amount of time in each stage. Some people make fast progress a=\r\nnd some people take more time. If God wills, one can become liberated in a =\r\nsecond. So don&#39;t worry wherever you are in terms of these &quot;stages&quot;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2=\r\n&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Ve=\r\nrdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font colo=\r\nr=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;=\r\nLEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;BTW, what you say=\r\n of &quot;external experiences&quot; applies to &quot;internal experiences&quot; as well. After=\r\n all, mind (especially an imaginative one) is capable of &quot;manufacturing&quot; ov=\r\ner time whatever it fancies. Some experiences can be hallucinations. Even w=\r\nhen not, they can reinforce some unneeded\n conditioning. I am not just talk=\r\ning about beginners, but even highly evolved sadhakas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div ali=\r\ngn=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/fon=\r\nt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;For example, there have been several elevated yogis claiming to be t=\r\nhe reincarnations of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. They may all have genuinely b=\r\nelieved it and not trying to deceive anyone. If one&#39;s mind nurtured a secre=\r\nt desire to be somebody important and if one likes Ramakrishna, it is possi=\r\nble to experience an internal vision suggesting that one is a reincarnation=\r\n of Ramakrishna.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font colo=\r\nr=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Let me give a subtler example. I =\r\nwas once discussing the meaning of &quot;Mantra Pushpam&quot; here (see http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/7015). A learned yogi wrote to\n me th=\r\nat it was about denser elements dissolving in lighter elements as Kundalini=\r\n ascends and denser elements coming back from lighter elements as Kundalini=\r\n descends. When I pointed out weaknesses in that interpretation, he told me=\r\n that that was the *vision* (internal experience) he got when he meditated =\r\nwith it. However, that absolutely does not add up. What is described in Man=\r\ntra Pushpam is not chain of X merging in Y, Y merging in Z, etc. Moreover, =\r\nall elements are not covered. Moreover, water is common, i.e. X lies in wat=\r\ner, water lies in X; Y lies in water, water lies in Y, and so on. That is d=\r\nifferent from dissolution and creation of elements as happens when Kundalin=\r\ni ascends and descends.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000=\r\n000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;fo=\r\nnt color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;However, I can believe tha=\r\nt that yogi may have indeed gotten the vision as he claimed. When one looks=\r\n at\n a verse (or any other notion or idea), one&#39;s rational mind may conscio=\r\nusly or sub-consciously come up with an intellectual understanding. If an i=\r\nmaginative and focused mind meditates then, it may indeed experience a corr=\r\nesponding vision! It is all a play of mind and of no significance. Not ever=\r\ny internal experience of even an elevated yogi who genuinely experienced as=\r\npects of divine (but not yet liberated) may mean something.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; s=\r\nize=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Knowing which internal experience is a result of some conditionin=\r\ng, some desire or some rational/emotional notion still present in the mind,=\r\n is not easy, even for good and sincere sadhakas.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D=\r\n&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;\n size=3D&quot;2&quot;=\r\n&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=\r\n=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;External and internal experiences =\r\ncannot be avoided as one does sadhana.

Both can be detrimental in som=\r\ne cases and increase pride or reinforce some wrong notions, and delay posit=\r\nive internal transformation or even trigger negative internal\n transformati=\r\non.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana=\r\n&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;=\r\n face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Vasishtha&#39;s guidance is very clear.

The mind lies in the commun=\r\nal stage (communal =3D anyone one who mentally identifies to a community no=\r\nt necessarily in a religious sense), trying to find a community of similar =\r\nminded individuals and hang on to the same in a subconscious attempt to def=\r\nine itself. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; s=\r\nize=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;2nd stage of Sadhana: Get bits and pieces of &quot;experiences&quot; in an =\r\nexternal format which the mind correlates to the process of sadhana and eit=\r\nher feels happy, or dejected. Soon it gets boring, for none of these so cal=\r\nled external &quot;experiences&quot; are consistent or even replicable at will. Doubt=\r\ns start creeping, boredom sets in, confusions galore, and some fall back to=\r\n stage 1 described above. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verd=\r\nana&quot;\n size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;3rd stage: One realizes the absolute futility of t=\r\nhe external experiences compared to what is happening inside, if at all any=\r\nthing is happening. Until a transformation process triggers inside the mind=\r\n, all of it is meaningless. The external world may crack open and 33 millio=\r\nns deities may dance infornt, yet it eventually counts for nothing if it is=\r\n not able to still the &quot;monkey-mind&quot; and make the sadhaka enjoy a concentra=\r\nted feeling of internal joy. This joy will overflow into other secular acti=\r\nvities and thoughts, it&#39;s so powerful and dynamic in nature. One who is fir=\r\nmly established in this stage, will never bother too much about the externa=\r\nl ritual, its source, its accuracy etc. He/she does not shun external ritua=\r\nls, but he/she realizes that the real barometer for judging the efficacy of=\r\n a sadhana is inside the mind and heart. This is the beginning of the &quot;alon=\r\ne&quot;\n phase. Alone, but not lonely. In loneliness one craves for external val=\r\nidation, in being alone one needs no validation apart from his/her own joy.=\r\n &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/fon=\r\nt&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;A=\r\ns such, if this person were to meet another sadhaka, the only worthy inform=\r\nation he/she will try to extract is what has the other person experienced i=\r\nnternally, and be least bothered about what path he/she walks and which dei=\r\nty he/she is trying to worship. Fancy names and theoretical classifications=\r\n do not impress him/her anymore. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000=\r\n00&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;From here starts the real journey. Before t=\r\nhat, stage 1 and stage 2 is like a kindergarten attitude. So each sadhaka m=\r\nust ask himself/herself objective, where does he/she stand and where is he/=\r\nshe headed! &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;=\r\n/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---814770868-890978357-1337374001=:33363--\r\n\n"}}
