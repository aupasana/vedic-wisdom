Faith in ourselves will do ever=\r\nything. I have experienced it in my own life, and am still doing so, and as=\r\n I grow older that faith is becoming stronger and stronger. He is an atheis=\r\nt who does not believe in himself. The old religions said that he was an at=\r\nheist who did not believe in God. The new religion says that he is an athei=\r\nst who does not believe in himself. But it is not selfish faith, because th=\r\ne Vedanta, again, is the doctrine of Oneness. It means faith in all, becaus=\r\ne you are all. \n\n\n"}}
