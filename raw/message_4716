That is why\n&gt; I said in a recent post that the world does not =\r\ndeserve\n&gt; the service of paramhamsas now.\n \nI am afraid our understanding o=\r\nf the word &quot;paramahamsa&quot; is not the same..\n \nSwan is supposed to able to re=\r\nmove water from milk. Similarly, a paramahamsa (absolute swan) is one who c=\r\nan extract out the bad in a person and leave him with the good that is alre=\r\nady in him. In other words, a paramahamsa is one who can interact with ANYO=\r\nNE (with any degrees of good and bad) and transform one into an ideal perso=\r\nn. For example, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa associated with drunkards and woman=\r\nizers like Girish and Kalipad and transformed them.\n \nIf one thinks the wor=\r\nld does not deserve one&#39;s services and lives in a cave, one may be great an=\r\nd realized, but not a paramahamsa.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn fact, look at=\r\n Parasara&#39;s directives on finding a paramahamsa. He said Mercury in 5th fro=\r\nm karakamsa makes one a paramahamsa. Why Mercury and why not Jupiter?\n \nJup=\r\niter is wise, but Mercury is flexible and adaptive. Mercury can identify wi=\r\nth anyone. Mercury is compassionate and can place himself in the shoes of a=\r\nnyone and think/feel like that person. That is also why Mercury is the kara=\r\nka for good communication skills. A good communicator can visualize from th=\r\ne angle of his audience.\n \nRamakrishna once identified with grass so strong=\r\nly that when a crow walked on the grass, there were bloody scratches on his=\r\n body. Such ability to identify with someone else is needed for transformin=\r\ng someone else. That is why Parasara mentioned Mercury for Paramahamsa.\n \n*=\r\n        *        *\n \n&gt; //There is no dearth of Chanakyas even today. There =\r\nis, however, not a single \n&gt; Chandragupta now. Few &quot;experts&quot;, if any, know =\r\nthat Chanakya was a paramhamsa \n&gt; sadhu. He went to jungle after saving the=\r\n nation.//\n&gt; \n&gt; I would disagree. Infact no real Chanakya exists today whic=\r\nh is the real \n&gt; problem. Creating a Chandragupta is easy for someone of Ch=\r\nanakya&#39;s caliber.\n \nI agree with Rajarshi on this. If a Chanakya is on eart=\r\nh and ready to guide Chandragupta, a Chandragupta would automatically come.=\r\n If a Samartha Ramadas is on earth and ready too guide Shivaji, a Shivaji w=\r\nould automatically come.\n \nIn fact, Swami Vivekananda once humbly said that=\r\n Ramakrishna could have created one thousand Vivekanandas from sand!\n \n*   =\r\n     *        *\n \n&gt; All your statements in this thread are true, but someti=\r\nmes\n&gt; differences in our language create unnecessary confusions.\n&gt; ...\n&gt; Th=\r\nus, I find your statements to be absolutely true. But\n&gt; greater clarity is =\r\nneeded at some points to ward off\n&gt; possible confusions.\n \nI suspected that=\r\n we did not have a real disagreement. But I was presenting a different pers=\r\npective to balance the presentation of ideas. However, the bottomline is th=\r\nat it is never possible to articulate this knowledge perfectly, using vaikh=\r\nari. Knowledge like this can be digested and absorbed only though experienc=\r\ne and not through reading or hearing words spoken in vaikhari. But then, wo=\r\nrds spoken in vaikhari can serve the important purpose of inspiring one, pe=\r\nrhaps to investigate and/or to do sadhana.\n \nThere is no alternative to sad=\r\nhana, whether meditation or homam or contemplation or hatha yoga or whateve=\r\nr.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; Rhetorical Question, Vinay_ji...\n&gt; \n&gt; If ALL r=\r\neferences of GOD were to be possibly wiped out from the\n&gt; collective memory=\r\n of humanity -- All kinds and forms of Gods and\n&gt; their NAMES really ---\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; How would the world and society look, feel, behave, act or react?\n \nReli=\r\ngion has two purposes: (1) Enable some seekers to experience Self and becom=\r\ne liberated and (2) maintain some sanity, righteousness and order in the wo=\r\nrld.\n \nIf there is no concept of god, no faith in god and no faith in after=\r\n-life, world can then degenerate into adharmik, selfish and animalistic pur=\r\nsuit of selfish needs of each person. However corrupted, religion and fear =\r\nof god bring some sanity and order to the world!\n \nIt is true that some rel=\r\nigions and some ideas of god may have degenerated very badly and causing mo=\r\nre harm than benefit. If so, such religions and ideas will be cleaned up by=\r\n the Natural Order when time comes, to be replaced by better ideas.\n \nBest =\r\nregards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings=\r\n,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n      =\r\n            http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a differenc=\r\ne: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWr=\r\nitings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n \n--- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;VJha&quot; &lt;vinayjhaa16@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; All your statements in this thread ar=\r\ne true, but sometimes differences in our language create unnecessary confus=\r\nions.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Gyani should live like a fool, away from limelight&quot; : this stat=\r\nement of Brahmopanishada is a general rule which needs no IF like &quot;if limel=\r\night duistracts one&quot;, because if limelight distracts, then the person is no=\r\nt a full-fledged Gyani.

Your keyword in &quot;What a gyani does&quot; is  &quot;DOES&quot;, ie,=\r\n Karma of a Gyani. It is very difficult to understand KARMA, as Gita says. =\r\nProper definitions of Karma, Akarma, Vikarma, etc, are needed. Since nobody=\r\n can live without doing something, as Gita says, what is Akarma in fact? Wh=\r\natever be the mode or type of action of a Gyani, it is done without any des=\r\nire of fruit for self, and therefore the actions of a Gyani should not be i=\r\nncluded in general Karma. The Karma which does not produce phala for the pe=\r\nrformer is Akarma. Brahmasutra speaks of four types of Moksha.\n&gt; \n&gt; //What =\r\na self-realized person does is dependent on the previous history of that so=\r\nul and what Nature expects from one.//\n&gt; \n&gt; Both YES and NO! A self-realize=\r\nd soul has to bear whatever is written in his/her birthchart for THIS LIFE.=\r\n But a self-realized soul burns away his/her entire previous history of Kar=\r\nmas and Samskaaras and therefore does not NEED rebirth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Liberated soul=\r\ns and incarnations of divine agencies come again and again NOT for obeying =\r\nPrakriti blindly, but for Loka-samgraha, for which the entire Creation was =\r\ncreated. They gain nothing in return. Rgveda says &quot;..Adit-Suryas tapati Tap=\r\nyatu vrithaa.&quot; Mortals perform Tapa for gaining something material or spiri=\r\ntual. But why the Surya is performing Tapa? What Surya will gain? Loka-samg=\r\nraha, because the Surya perceives all other souls as its own parts and want=\r\ns their well being.\n&gt; \n&gt; //to remain in duality, with the senses perceiving=\r\n objects of duality, and yet remain in oneness with the underlying oneness/=\r\n/\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, this is the proper way of living in this world for a self reali=\r\nzed soul. There is no alternative in this world. One cannot remain in perpe=\r\ntual nirvikalpa samadhi in this world. But it is not proper to call the for=\r\nmer as a &quot;higher state&quot;. It is not advisable to discuss real Samadhi in a p=\r\nublic fora. These things are taught by a spiritual Guru to the disciple acc=\r\nording to the propensity and ability of the latter.\n&gt; \n&gt; As you have used t=\r\nhe term &quot;higher state&quot;, let me say that the highest state of samadhi is ind=\r\need that type of samadhi which was attained in battlefield by entire dynast=\r\ny of Rama, and for sometime by Arjuna. It is &quot;Yoga of the Rajarshis&quot; accord=\r\ning to Gita, which had vanished from this world after Ikshvaku dynasty and =\r\nwas temporarily given to Arjuna after a long absence during entire Dvapar y=\r\nuga. There were many rishis and paramhamsa in Dvapar. But only Arjuna attai=\r\nned Rajarshi-yoga. Lord Krishna was not a yogi, He was and is the aim of al=\r\nl yogas (=3DCommunion).\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, I find your statements to be absolutely =\r\ntrue.

They retain their identity till the end o=\r\nf the creation cycle and yet are ever liberated.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I am quoting a r=\r\nelevant writeup from message 438 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup titled &quot;Rishis&quot;=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; All that our senses perceive is M=\r\naya (delusion) that is created by the power of duality. If the veil of delu=\r\nsion is removed, there is no duality and all is ONE uniform and undivided c=\r\nonsciousness, known variously as Aatman or Brahman or Narayana or Sadashiva=\r\n. This one uniform and undivided consciousness is known as &quot;unmanifested Br=\r\nahman&quot;. The world of duality, where there are many different objects, is al=\r\nso actually Brahman only, but Brahman that went through some modification a=\r\nnd manifestation. It is known as &quot;manifested Brahman&quot;. Both are Brahman onl=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Normally, living in the domain of duality without being delude=\r\nd by some aspect of duality or the other is near to impossible. Remaining i=\r\nn duality with a perfect understanding of the underlying oneness of all obj=\r\nects and perceiving all those objects of duality without experiencing attra=\r\nction or repulsion for any single object of duality is almost impossible. M=\r\nost spiritual aspirants try to reach the state of oneness with unmanifested=\r\n Brahman - a state in which there is no duality and no objectification - an=\r\nd become absorbed in that state forever. That is the advaitic experience of=\r\n &quot;nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; and what happens in &quot;moksha&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, maha=\r\nrshis have described higher states. It is possible to be in oneness with ma=\r\nnifested Brahman and unmanifested Brahman at the same time. It is possible =\r\nto remain in duality, with the senses perceiving objects of duality, and ye=\r\nt remain in oneness with the underlying oneness (Brahman) of all obejcts an=\r\nd not be deluded, i.e. not experience either attraction or repulsion for an=\r\ny object of duality. Mere perception of objects by the senses is not the pr=\r\noblem. The tendency of mind to be find some attractive and find some repuls=\r\nive is the problem. It is possible to remain in a state where there is neit=\r\nher attraction nor repulsion for any object is possible.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Such a s=\r\ntate is experienced by very few beings. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Shirdi Sai=\r\n Baba etc were in this state always. Swami Vivekananda also experienced it.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Rishis are beings who are always in a very high state. They are =\r\nalways alert to the maya and yet not stuck in it. They perceive objects of =\r\nduality and yet are not attracted or repelled by anything. If one overcomes=\r\n attraction and repulsion and yet remains in duality, one can pretty much d=\r\no anything. But because one is neither attracted or repelled by anything, i=\r\nt means one has no personal ego and one has no reason to do anything for pe=\r\nrsonal ego. Then one becomes an instrument of nature (Prakriti) and impleme=\r\nnts the wish of nature through one&#39;s actions, which are performed without a=\r\nny attachment or personal identification. One who has a personal ego can do=\r\n limited things. One who has a very very small ego can do great things. One=\r\n who has no ego can do ANY thing. But such a being does things that are des=\r\nired by Nature - the natural order of the universe. They can change the cou=\r\nrse of history of nations and planets.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; A rishi in this state may =\r\nengage in various actions of great consequence for the world. Yet, there is=\r\n no attachment with the actions. He is just an unattached instrument of Nat=\r\nure.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If one gets out of the duality and becomes absorbed in unman=\r\nifested Brahman forever, one is not born again. But a rishi who has an equa=\r\nl vision of unmanifested and manifested Brahman is for ever mukta (liberate=\r\nd). Thus, he will freely interact with duality without any fear or aversion=\r\n. Amsa of such a rishi may even be born again as a separate person, just as=\r\n a process running in a computer may spawn off a separate thread to do some=\r\n focussed task. Even if the computer process has finished all the initializ=\r\nation and early work, the newly spawned thread has to go through initializa=\r\ntion etc again. Similarly, the person born with amsa has to go through the =\r\nprocess of overcoming weaknesses and realizing self all over again. When a =\r\nVivekananda is born from the amsa of a rishi, he may have to struggle initi=\r\nally and overcome the weaknesses and realize self all over again. But he is=\r\n the amsa of an ever free and liberated being and will find his way again.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Thus, a liberated rishi, with the force of his liberated consciou=\r\nsness and with the force of his reborn amsas, will act as an unattached ins=\r\ntrument of Nature performing actions of tremendous consequences without any=\r\n personal ego driving those actions.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; BTW, Ramakrishna specificall=\r\ny said six of his disciples were ever liberated.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *      =\r\n  *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The full message can be read at:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/438\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Rishis&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *     =\r\n   *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ..spiritual Guru of Swami Ramakrishna Paramhamsa..\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Vasishtha, Viswamitra and Rama were all gyanis.

Anyone who \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claims to be Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada, MUST =\r\nBE associated and surrounded by a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bunch of ATLEAST 15/20 very high=\r\n caliber sadhakas.=C3=83=E2=80=9A  These very high caliber \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhaka=\r\ns=C3=83=E2=80=9A who will surround a reborn Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada will e=\r\nach be like \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual stalwarts in their own rights, like each of =\r\nRamakrishna and Ma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarada&#39;s disciples were (Swami Brahmananda, Swa=\r\nmi Premananda, Swami Sivananda \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc etc) when they had=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A incarnated. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So unless this condition is met, (which R=\r\namakrishna himself had specified in his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; last birth), most of the R=\r\namakrishna or Ma Sarada reincarnation-claimants have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be dis-qua=\r\nlified. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some people have an impression that if and when R=\r\namakrishna and Ma Sarada and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swamiji reincarnate, they would have =\r\nan association with the Ramakrishna \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mission. This is, in my opinio=\r\nn, an incorrect assumption. When Lord Krishna was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; born, he did not=\r\n spend his time trying to find out where is Ayodhya since he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was=\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A also=C3=83=E2=80=9A Lord Rama is his=C3=83=E2=80=9A past li=\r\nfe. Similarly,=C3=83=E2=80=9A these souls (Ramakrishna and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ma=C3=\r\n=83=E2=80=9A Sarada and their disciples)=C3=83=E2=80=9A are of such high ca=\r\nliber that they do come back \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when it is designed and needed for th=\r\nem to come back and perform some strong \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; objectives and set in moti=\r\non a spiritual impulse in this land based on the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessities of th=\r\ne specific desh-kaal-patra. Therefore what they do will be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; based p=\r\nurely on the zeitgeist - spirit of the times - when they incarnate.=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A  For \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all one knows, Ramakrishna may not incarnate as a s=\r\nimple rustic villager any \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more, but rather=C3=83=E2=80=9A as a wel=\r\nl-educated,=C3=83=E2=80=9A city-bred individual with the practical \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n intelligence of ten Chanakyas who might end up changing the political and =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual future of this land for centuries to come, which is what=\r\n the necessity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the present=C3=83=E2=80=9A times really are. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We already have an overdose of Swamis and Babas and Mas and =\r\nBhagwans and their \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ashrams and their teeming millions as followers=\r\n. What we need is someone who=C3=83=E2=80=9A may \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or may not have a=\r\nn ashram, who may or may not pose as a Guru in the traditional \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sen=\r\nse, who may or may not be a glib talker (as so many of the Babas and Mas ar=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these days), but who has the necessary might and power to affect=\r\n or initiate \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; changes in this land which would be of an irrevocable=\r\n nature.=C3=83=E2=80=9A  It is time for a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1000 years of history to=\r\n change. And only a soul of Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caliber can=\r\n do it. Anyone lesser, would only fizz out=C3=83=E2=80=9A with time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Not that=C3=83=E2=80=9A they (Ramakrishna or Ma Sarada or=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A Swamiji) will find the work to be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy at all. For start=\r\nes, the dunces would be in confederacy against them. When \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekana=\r\nda, before he became world famous, had gone to Kasi, he was bitterly \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; opposed by the &#39;scholarly&#39; pandits of the city on various issues. Then a=\r\n young \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not-yet-famous Vivekananda got angry and decided he will le=\r\nave Kasi and never \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; return to that city untill he &quot;falls on society=\r\n like a thunderbolt&quot;. Well, that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is precisely what he did. He fell=\r\n on Indian society like a thunderbolt, after \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which those very pand=\r\nits of Kasi wrote to him, asking him to come and grace \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their city!=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So let us keep our fingers crossed and not=C3=83=E2=80=\r\n=9A focus on emtpy speculations, rather \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wait for the most interest=\r\ning coming=C3=83=E2=80=9A decade to unfold in all its=C3=83=E2=80=9A sound =\r\nand fury.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namas=\r\nte Ranjan,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After you die, what would be your name and re=\r\nligion and nationality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Name can change on rebirth. Though =\r\nreligion usually stays the same, it CAN \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change. Nationality can of=\r\n course change too. Job, skills, external nature, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; looks, gender, e=\r\nven yoni (human, cow, goat, chicken, tiger etc) can all change \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fro=\r\nm birth to birth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Basically, the seed of one&#39;s new birth i=\r\ns formed at the time of one&#39;s death. As \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s connection is severe=\r\nd with the body, the last desires/thoughts/ponderings \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the mind =\r\nbecome the seed for the next life. Nature chooses for one a future \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n course that allows one to pursue those desires, as much as allowed by one&#39;=\r\ns \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous karmas and debts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one is able to no=\r\nt entertain ANY desire as one element after another \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; evaporates in =\r\none&#39;s existence, one becomes liberated. All the spiritual sadhana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwe do is a dress rehearsal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when =\r\nwe see you again and do you know how we\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shall recognize you, IF W=\r\nE EVER MEET YOU?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I and you like each other and your reb=\r\nirth and my rebirth meet each other, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they will start off taking a =\r\nliking to each other. If I and you dislike each \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other and your reb=\r\nirth and my rebirth meet each other, they will start off \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disliking=\r\n each other. This will happen without either being consciously aware of \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who one was and who the other person was, in the last life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, if your question is how we can recognize that so and so pe=\r\nrson is a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rebirth of Swami Vivekananda, so and so person is a rebi=\r\nrth of Paramahamsa \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yogananda etc, the answer is complex.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reborn person may not look like the old person or do similar wo=\r\nrk or have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; much *external* similarity. So it is difficult to &quot;reco=\r\ngnize&quot; one. After all, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rama advocated eka patni vrata (one wife pr=\r\ninciple), while Krishna had thousands \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of wives. Rama was a great w=\r\narrior and killed Ravana in the biggest war of his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; times. Krishna =\r\nwas a key player in the biggest war of his time, but did not take \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\na weapon at all. The game can be diffent in each coming..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n* * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When it comes to recognizing the rebirth of a great =\r\nsoul, it can become a trap.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna explicitly told Sa=\r\nrada Mata that he would be back after 100 years \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and that everybody=\r\n else who came with him would have to come back with him. When \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sar=\r\nada Mata and Lakshmi Devi protested, he said they did not have a choice! Ev=\r\nen \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swami Vivekananda said once in USA, &quot;I have to come back once m=\r\nore. The Master \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said I am to come back once more with him&quot;. When q=\r\nuestioned &quot;you have to come \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back because Shri Ramakrishna says so&quot;=\r\n, he replied, &quot;souls like that have great \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; power, Madam&quot;. On anothe=\r\nr occasion, Ramakrishna said that people would get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liberated en ma=\r\nsse during his next coming and that would be the last opportunity \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nfor a long time to come.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, two good saints cl=\r\naimed to be re-incarnations of Ramakrishna \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since then. One of them=\r\n is wrong (or perhaps both!). Another good saint \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggested that sh=\r\ne is the re-incarnation of Sarada Mata. Satya Sai Baba said \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that h=\r\ne identified a particular young man as the reincarnation of Swami \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nVivekananda. Ramakrishna was surrounded by Sarada Mata and more than twenty=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; disciples of a very high caliber and different aptitudes. Togethe=\r\nr, they nearly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; moulded the direction of spiritual India for the ne=\r\nxt century. None of the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; claimants of rebirthhood are surrounded by=\r\n people of such caliber or fit the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bill.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, th=\r\nere can be false claimants to the rebirthhood of a great soul! It is not \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; that they are lying. They may simply be deluding themselves and of c=\r\nourse ego is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the root of delusion!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, is it=\r\n necessary to recognize whether X is a rebirth of Y, given that X \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nand Y are different and play a different game? A small discussion on this p=\r\noint \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vis-a-vis Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s example can be found in:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/807\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though external factors like nationali=\r\nty, religion, name, job, looks, gender etc \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can change, some intern=\r\nal factors may remain the same. Moreover, who one likes, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who one d=\r\nislikes, what values one is attracted to internally, etc, may remain \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; essentially the same.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For example, suppose rajput king =\r\nPrithviraj was reborn as Muslim emperor Akbar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (as said by Vimalana=\r\nnda). One was a Hindu and the other was a Muslim. However, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; both we=\r\nre very brave, unafraid of death, inherently spiritual, had a refined \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; taste in fine arts and had deep conviction. The previous connections wi=\r\nth \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rajputs resulted in Akbar being born and raised when his mother=\r\n was hiding at a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rajput household, before moving to Delhi. Despite=\r\n being a Muslim, he actually \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; helped the Hindu causes (to the exten=\r\nt possible at that time) by putting an end \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to barbaric practices l=\r\nike killing defeated Hindu kings and all Hindu priests in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conquere=\r\nd places. He promoted acceptance of other faiths, canceled pilgrimage \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; taxes on Hindus and even came up with his own religion of humanity towa=\r\nrds the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; end of his life by integrating various religions. In one l=\r\nife, he tried to save \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; India from invading barbarians. In another, =\r\nhe was born as a cultured man amid \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; barbarians and tried to save In=\r\ndia by changing the ways of his own people. There \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a subtle cont=\r\ninuity in the agenda at a deeper level!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a differen=\r\nce: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rohinicryst=\r\nal&quot; &lt;jyotish_vani@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Lokesh_ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As nearly ALL of do except this &quot;BABAJI&quot; Character described in La=\r\nhiri Mahashay \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;(no connection with the ayanamshaa that is causing =\r\nlot of problems for many!), \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Yukteshwar and Yognanda and Kriya Yog=\r\na -- shall probably die and hopefully be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;born again -- here is a =\r\nsimple question from a simpleton:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After you die, what =\r\nwould be your name and religion and nationality, when we \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;see you =\r\nagain and do you know how we shall recognize you, IF WE EVER MEET YOU?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not being FLIPPANT at all but just reminding you and =\r\nmyself how evanescent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;each of us truly ARE!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nRohiniranjan\n\n\n"}}
