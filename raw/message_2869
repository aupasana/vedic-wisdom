*\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;The world is bound by actions other than tho=\r\nse performed for the sake of\n&gt; sacrifice; do thou, therefore, O son of Kunt=\r\ni (Arjuna), perform action for\n&gt; that sake (for sacrifice alone), free from=\r\n attachment.&quot; (Gita III-9)\n&gt;\n&gt; When we are born into a particular set up of=\r\n circumstances which we call a\n&gt; family, all the conditioning factors of th=\r\ne family are also born together\n&gt; with us. The tradition of the family grow=\r\ns when we grow. The pattern of our\n&gt; character and conduct is entirely dete=\r\nrmined by the idealogical background\n&gt; that is at the very basis of the str=\r\nucture of that particular family. We are\n&gt; born not merely in a family but =\r\nalso in wider circumstances called the\n&gt; community, nation, world, universe=\r\n, etc., to all which we owe obligations.\n&gt; Our obligation to a condition in=\r\nto which we are born is sacrifice or *\n&gt; Yajna* and that is what Bhagavan S=\r\nri Krishna speaks of in the above verse.\n&gt;\n&gt; When we are born, we are born =\r\nwith certain obligations. What are these\n&gt; obligations? They are the allegi=\r\nance that we perforce owe to those factors\n&gt; that are responsible for our b=\r\nirth and maintenance. That is the sacrifice\n&gt; which we are called upon to d=\r\no. In the *Vedas*, which are antecedent even\n&gt; to the Mahabharata and the B=\r\nhagavadgita, we are given the first primeval\n&gt; concept of sacrifice. Suprem=\r\ne sacrifice is extolled in the *Veda*,\n&gt; according to which the Absolute it=\r\nself is the first performer of the *\n&gt; Yajna* and not a *Pandit*. The Absol=\r\nute did the first *Yajna* and then the\n&gt; others followed. They are only imi=\r\ntating what the Absolute did, originally.\n&gt;\n&gt; What was the sacrifice that t=\r\nhe Absolute did and who was the performer of\n&gt; that sacrifice? Where was th=\r\ne *Vedi* or the *Yajna-kunda* for that\n&gt; sacrifice and what was the materia=\r\nl that was offered in that sacrifice? *&#39;Yajnena\n&gt; Yajnamayajanta Devah&#39;*, s=\r\nays the *Purusha-Sukta*. *Yajna* was the\n&gt; sacrifice, *Yajna* was offered i=\r\nn *Yajna* by *Yajna* for the sake of*Yajna\n&gt; *. Sacrifice was offered in th=\r\ne sacrifice, through the sacrifice, for the\n&gt; sake of sacrifice. What do yo=\r\nu understand from this? You understand nothing,\n&gt; except a jumble of words.=\r\n Similar to this enigmatic statement of the *Veda\n&gt; *, we have another stat=\r\nement in the Bhagavadgita also: *&#39;Brahmarpanam\n&gt; Brahmahavir-Brahmagnou Bra=\r\nhmana Hutam, Brahmaiva Tena Gantavyam Brahmakarma\n&gt; Samadhina&#39;*. Brahman is=\r\n offering Brahman through Brahman for the sake of\n&gt; Brahman. What does it m=\r\nean? It seems as confusing as that *Vedic Mantra*.\n&gt; But let us remember th=\r\nat this is what sacrifice precisely means. It is a\n&gt; universal involvement =\r\nof factors wherein and whereby we become the property\n&gt; of the whole creati=\r\non. Can you imagine this situation where we become the\n&gt; property of everyo=\r\nne in the world! Anyone can demand anything from us, and\n&gt; we must give it!=\r\n We have an obligation to everything in this world. That\n&gt; obligation is th=\r\ne sacrifice that we are called upon to do. That is the *\n&gt; Yajna*.\n&gt;\n&gt; Our =\r\nobligation is not merely to our parents, brothers and sisters, not\n&gt; merely=\r\n to the government of our country that protects us, not merely to the\n&gt; pla=\r\nnet earth on which we live, not merely to the solar system which gives us\n&gt;=\r\n light, heat and energy. Oh God! We have got larger demands upon us and if =\r\nwe\n&gt; can think for a moment the obligations that we really owe to this wond=\r\nerful\n&gt; creation of God, we will not be able to breathe for a moment! Becau=\r\nse we are\n&gt; not able to fulfil all these obligations in a short span of lif=\r\ne, we are\n&gt; reborn. Otherwise we need not be reborn. If we have fulfilled o=\r\nr discharged\n&gt; all our duties in this very life itself, why should we take =\r\nnext birth! But,\n&gt; life is short, and also we have not got the least concep=\r\nt of what\n&gt; obligations we bear or owe to the universe outside. Even when w=\r\ne are ninety\n&gt; years old, this knowledge will not come to us. So, naturally=\r\n we die with\n&gt; ignorance. And because of this ignorance we are not able to =\r\ndischarge our\n&gt; duties properly. Because of the non-discharge of the duties=\r\n and obligations\n&gt; properly, we are hurled into transmigration. And so long=\r\n as we do not\n&gt; understand the meaning of the sacrifice that we are expecte=\r\nd to perform and\n&gt; fulfil the obligations that we owe to the conditions of =\r\nour existence, we\n&gt; cannot avoid undergoing this process of births and deat=\r\nhs.\n&gt;\n&gt; What are the conditions of our existence? Parents are a conditionin=\r\ng\n&gt; factor. They have given birth to us, they feed us, take care of us and\n=\r\n&gt; educate us. Society is another conditioning factor. You know how much we =\r\nowe\n&gt; to the society. Though it may not be visible outwardly, invisibly the=\r\n\n&gt; society protects us, takes care of us and helps us in many ways. The nat=\r\nion\n&gt; and the international system help us. The stellar systems also help u=\r\ns. In\n&gt; short, the whole cosmos helps us. Therefore, we owe a universal obl=\r\nigation\n&gt; to all things in the universe. When we go for a walk in the jungl=\r\nes,\n&gt; sometimes a part of our cloth gets caught in a thorny bush and when w=\r\ne try\n&gt; to remove a thorn and move forward, we will find that another thorn=\r\n is\n&gt; pricking us from behind. When we try to remove that, here it pricks a=\r\ngain,\n&gt; so that we find ourselves unable to get out of it. When we are free=\r\nd from\n&gt; one side, we are caught from another side. Similarly, when we disc=\r\nharge one\n&gt; obligation, we will find that another obligation has not been d=\r\nischarged. We\n&gt; cannot have an integral vision of things. We are partial, s=\r\nhort-sighted\n&gt; people. We have a very narrow vision of things and it is thi=\r\ns narrow vision\n&gt; that is responsible for our birth and death.\n&gt;\n&gt; This mys=\r\nterious law, the law of *Yajna*, operates in the world. *&#39;Yajno\n&gt; vai Vishn=\r\nuh&#39;*--Supreme Narayana Himself is called *Yajna*. The term &#39;*\n&gt; Yajna*&#39; sig=\r\nnifies the whole of the culture of *Bharatavarsha*. If you want\n&gt; one word =\r\nwhich can give us the quintessence of the whole of the culture of\n&gt; India, =\r\n&#39;*Yajna*&#39; is that word. How meaningful it is, we can imagine. Every\n&gt; cultu=\r\nral pattern and every presupposition of human existence is contained in\n&gt; t=\r\nhis pregnant term &#39;*Yajna*&#39;, which means the universal sacrifice that the\n&gt;=\r\n soul performs. The performer of the sacrifice is the soul. It is not an *\n=\r\n&gt; Acharya* or a *Pandit*.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the *Anugita* of the Mahabharata, which is=\r\n a sequel to the\n&gt; Bhagavadgita, this *Yajna* is described in a very beauti=\r\nful form. It\n&gt; states what *Yajna* actually is. This *Yajna* is going on da=\r\nily in this\n&gt; body and it is going on everywhere in the world, outside and =\r\ninside. It is\n&gt; sacrifice of all those factors which tend to tether the sou=\r\nl to the bodily\n&gt; tabernacle into the fire of the knowledge of the Absolute=\r\n. This is called\n&gt; *Jnana-Yajna* which means the offering of knowledge into=\r\n the fire of\n&gt; Knowledge. Which knowledge is offered into which knowledge? =\r\nThe knowledge of\n&gt; our individual existence in all its aspects is offered i=\r\nn the knowledge of\n&gt; the Supreme Being. The concept of this mysterious *Dha=\r\nrma* before us\n&gt; cannot be contained in our minds. Our heads will burst if =\r\nwe start thinking\n&gt; deeply about these implications of our life.\n&gt;\n&gt; Knowle=\r\ndge is too vast. Our life is not long enough to have all the\n&gt; knowledge ne=\r\ncessary. The ancient masters, the Seers saw with their\n&gt; premonition, intui=\r\ntion or forevision that people cannot contain the *Vedic\n&gt; * knowledge in t=\r\nheir heads. *&#39;Ananta vai Vedah&#39;*--*Vedas *are endless or\n&gt; infinite, which =\r\nmeans to say knowledge has no limit. People in this *Kali\n&gt; Yuga* especiall=\r\ny are so feeble physically, morally and intellectually,\n&gt; that this truth h=\r\nas to be instilled into their minds through some other\n&gt; manner. This is wh=\r\ny *Vyasa* wrote the great Epic Mahabharata. He found out\n&gt; that the *Vedas*=\r\n are of no use to poor human beings in this *Kali Yuga*.\n&gt; Whatever the *Ve=\r\ndas* say would not enter our heads, because they contain\n&gt; impersonal scien=\r\ntific knowledge. How many of us are scientific? We are all\n&gt; ignorant, rust=\r\nic villagers in our way of thinking. Crude thinking is our\n&gt; habit. Subtle,=\r\n universal, scientific thinking as is contained in the *\n&gt; Vedas* is far fr=\r\nom us.\n&gt;\n&gt; When I say the *Vedas* are scientific, I am not making a joke. M=\r\nasters\n&gt; like Swami Dayananda Sarasvati, who founded the *Arya Samaj*; Saya=\r\nna, the\n&gt; great commentator of the*Vedas*; Aurobindo, of our own times; the=\r\n Puri\n&gt; Sankaracharya, the late Bharati Krishna Tirtha;--they all have stru=\r\nggled to\n&gt; point out that every science is contained in the *Vedas*. Even s=\r\nubjects\n&gt; such as aeronautics, ship-building, mathematics of the highest ty=\r\npe in\n&gt; differential calculus, infinite calculus,--everything is in the *Ve=\r\ndas*.\n&gt; Sri Bharati Krishna Tirtha has written a book called &#39;Vedic Mathema=\r\ntics&#39;,\n&gt; and it has been published by the Benares Hindu University. The *Ve=\r\nda\n&gt; Samhitas *contain the highest reaches of Mathematics. Many think that =\r\nthe\n&gt; *Vedas* are only some foolish chants of cowherds of Punjab, as Britis=\r\nh\n&gt; historians tell us. The *Aryans* were regarded as cowherds grazing thei=\r\nr\n&gt; cows in Punjab and blabbering something and that became the *Vedas*. Th=\r\nis\n&gt; is the British interpretation of our culture, which has gone into our =\r\nheads!\n&gt; The *Vedas* are not blabbering of that kind. They are intuitional\n=\r\n&gt; revelations of ecstatic souls who had the vision of the Absolute. And,\n&gt; =\r\ntherefore, this vision-integral contains every type of knowledge--physics,\n=\r\n&gt; chemistry, biology, sociology, mathematics, astronomy, alchemy, *Ayurveda=\r\n*,\n&gt; military science and what not. How can we contain all these things? We=\r\n,\n&gt; therefore, bid good-bye to *Vedas*. So the master Vyasa, Krishna\n&gt; Dvai=\r\npayana Vyasa, wrote the Mahabharata and the *Puranas* to explain these\n&gt; ve=\r\nry impersonal scientific truths of the *Vedas* in personal Epic style.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nIn villages some ladies have got a peculiar habit. Suppose a lady wants a\n&gt;=\r\n Sari. She cannot tell directly to her husband, &#39;I want a Sari&#39;. So, she wi=\r\nll\n&gt; say: &quot;The neighbour&#39;s wife has purchased a new Sari today; it is very =\r\ngood,\n&gt; very nice; I saw it myself.&quot; Her husband understands her intentions=\r\n. He will\n&gt; say: &quot;Why do you describe all these things? All right, I will p=\r\nurchase one\n&gt; for you.&quot; And the poor man purchases a Sari. The Epics and *P=\r\nuranas* follow\n&gt; a similar indirect way of instructing the truths. But the =\r\n*Vedas* directly\n&gt; tell the truth openly: &#39;You must do this, it is like thi=\r\ns.&#39; This is\n&gt; scientific. Science always plainly tells the truth as it is, =\r\nwithout any\n&gt; camouflage. The Epics and the *Puranas* do not say directly t=\r\nhat you must\n&gt; be a good man. They say: &#39;Yudhishthira was a good man. His v=\r\nirtue was so\n&gt; immense. He shared everything that he had. His conduct was s=\r\no adventurous\n&gt; that as a result he got so many things.&#39; One who hears this=\r\n feels: &#39;Oh, I\n&gt; see, then I must also do like that.&#39; These texts are calle=\r\nd *\n&gt; Suhrit-Sammitas*, while the *Vedas* are known as *Prabhu-Sammitas*. T=\r\nhe\n&gt; latter command like a master. Science always commands on principles. T=\r\nhe\n&gt; Puranas and Epics give stories, ancient history and make us think\n&gt; sc=\r\nientifically in an indirect manner, as though with a sugar-coated pill.\n&gt; T=\r\nhat is why it is said *&#39;Bharatam Panchamo Vedah&#39;*. While the *Vedas* are\n&gt; =\r\nsupposed to be four, the Mahabharata is the fifth*Veda*. It is as\n&gt; importa=\r\nnt as the *Vedas*. Sometimes they say, it is even more important\n&gt; than the=\r\n *Vedas*.\n&gt;\n&gt; Whatever it is, when knowledge gets adulterated through inten=\r\nse sensory\n&gt; activity, weakness of will and lack of moral force, the unders=\r\ntanding of *\n&gt; Dharma* also falls. So we must have a whip to goad us to the=\r\n path of *\n&gt; Dharma*, spirituality and God-consciousness. The tradition of =\r\nIndia,\n&gt; Bharatavarsha, is full of such goading whips. While the *Vedas*, t=\r\nhe\n&gt; Puranas and the Epics may be said to be direct teachers in an institut=\r\nion or\n&gt; an academy, the culture of India has also instituted many occasion=\r\ns for\n&gt; bringing home to our mind facts of our eternal glory and our duties=\r\n to God,\n&gt; the world and mankind. We owe three kinds of duty which are ment=\r\nioned in the\n&gt; eighteenth chapter of the Bhagavadgita*, &#39;Yajno danam tapas-=\r\nchaiva\n&gt; pavanani manishinam&#39;*. They are *Yajna, Dana *and *Tapas*. *Yajna*=\r\n itself\n&gt; contains in its meaning all possible knowledge and the mandate on=\r\n ethics.\n&gt; Still we are told*Yajna*, *Dana* and *Tapas* constitute the high=\r\nest\n&gt; necessity of religion. While *Tapas* is the duty that we owe to our o=\r\nwn\n&gt; selves, *Dana* is that which we owe to others, and *Yajna* is that we =\r\nowe\n&gt; to God. *Tapas* is austerity. We must perform austerity. We must live=\r\n a\n&gt; very restrained life. *Dana* is charitable feeling, charitable nature =\r\nand\n&gt; charitable act in respect of others, while *Yajna* is the self-dedica=\r\ntion\n&gt; we make of our own self wholly and totally to the Supreme Being.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n We have various occasions throughout the year to remind us of the threefol=\r\nd\n&gt; duty. They are called *Vratas*, some of which are annual, some monthly =\r\nand\n&gt; some daily. The Dipavali Vrata is observed every year on the fourteen=\r\nth day\n&gt; (*Chaturdasi*) of the dark-fortnight in the month of *Kartika* (Oc=\r\ntober-November).\n&gt; People take a holy oil bath, put on new clothes, eat del=\r\nicious dishes.\n&gt; Crackers are burst and lines of light are lit everywhere. =\r\nThere is an\n&gt; atmosphere of gaiety and sanctity. Goddess Lakshmi is worship=\r\nped and Divine\n&gt; grace is invoked. Though there are many stories associated=\r\n with this\n&gt; celebration of Dipavali, the prominent one is the killing of t=\r\nhe demon\n&gt; Narakasura by Lord Sri Krishna, while returning to Dwaraka from =\r\nIndraloka,\n&gt; from where he brought the *Parijata* plant, to fulfil the wish=\r\nes of\n&gt; Satyabhama, his consort.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Dipavali festival is regarded as a=\r\nn occasion particularly associated\n&gt; with an ancient event of Sri Krishna o=\r\nvercoming the demoniacal force known\n&gt; as Narakasura, recorded in the Epics=\r\n and Puranas. After the great victory\n&gt; over Narakasura in a battle, which =\r\nappears to have lasted for long, long\n&gt; days, Sri Krishna with his consort =\r\nSatyabhama returned to his abode in\n&gt; Dwaraka. The residents of Dwaraka wer=\r\ne very anxious about the delay caused\n&gt; in Sri Krishna&#39;s returning and it i=\r\ns said that they were worshipping\n&gt; Bhagavati Lakshmi for the prosperity an=\r\nd welfare of everyone and the quick\n&gt; returning of Bhagavan Sri Krishna and=\r\n Satyabhama. And, after Sri Krishna\n&gt; returned, the story goes that he took=\r\n a bath after applying oil over his\n&gt; body, to cleanse himself subsequent t=\r\no the very hectic work he had to do in\n&gt; the war that ensued earlier. This =\r\noil-bath connected with Sri Krishna&#39;s\n&gt; ritual is also one of the reasons f=\r\nor people necessarily remembering to take\n&gt; an oil-bath on the day known as=\r\n Naraka Chaturdasi, prior to the Amavasya,\n&gt; when Lakshmi Puja is conducted=\r\n. Everyone in India remembers to take an\n&gt; oil-bath on Naraka Chaturdasi in=\r\n memory of, in honour of, Bhagavan Sri\n&gt; Krishna&#39;s doing that after the dem=\r\nise of Narakasura. Having taken the bath,\n&gt; they all joined together in gre=\r\nat delight in the grand worship of\n&gt; Maha-Lakshmi for general prosperity of=\r\n everyone in Dwaraka. This is the\n&gt; traditional background, as is told to u=\r\ns, of the rites and the worships\n&gt; connected with Naraka Chaturdasi and Dip=\r\navali Amavasya.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a third aspect of it which is called *Bali Pad=\r\nya*, the day\n&gt; following Amavasya. It does not look that Bali Padya festiva=\r\nl is directly\n&gt; connected with Lakshmi Puja or Naraka Chaturdasi. But it ha=\r\ns another\n&gt; background altogether, namely, the blessing Narayana, in His in=\r\ncarnation as\n&gt; Vamana, bestowed upon the demon-king Bali Chakravarti, whom =\r\nHe subdued when\n&gt; He took a Cosmic Form in the Yajnasala of Bali, the detai=\r\nls of which we can\n&gt; read in the Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bali Chak=\r\nravarti was himself a great devotee, an ideal king and ruler, and\n&gt; having =\r\nsubmitted himself to being thrown into the nether regions by the\n&gt; pressure=\r\n of the foot of Narayana in the Cosmic Form, it appears he begged of\n&gt; Him =\r\nto have some occasion to come up to the surface of the earth and then be\n&gt; =\r\nrecognised as a devotee of Bhagavan Narayana Himself. This recognition, thi=\r\ns\n&gt; hallowed memory of Bali Chakravarti, is celebrated on the first day of =\r\nthe\n&gt; bright fortnight following the Amavasya. Bali Puja, Bali Padya are so=\r\nme of\n&gt; the terms used to designate this occasion, the day next to Amavasya=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; So, the sum and substance of the message connected with Dipavali is t=\r\nhat it\n&gt; is a three day festival, beginning with Naraka Chaturdasi, a day p=\r\nrior to\n&gt; Amavasya; then the main Lakshmi worship day, which is Amavasya it=\r\nself; and\n&gt; the third day which is Bali Padya connected with the honour bes=\r\ntowed upon\n&gt; Bali Chakravarti as a devotee of Bhagavan Narayana. It is also=\r\n an occasion\n&gt; for spiritual exhilaration, a lighting up of all darkness, s=\r\nocially as well\n&gt; as personally, outwardly and inwardly, for the purpose of=\r\n allowing an entry\n&gt; of the Supreme Light of God into the hearts of all peo=\r\nple.\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt; *Dipavali* means the line of lights. *Dipa* is light; and *Av=\r\nali* means\n&gt; line. So, *Dipavali* or the festival of the line of lights is =\r\nthe\n&gt; celebration of the rise of Knowledge. It is also the celebration of t=\r\nhe\n&gt; victory of the *Sattvic* or divine elements in us over the *Rajasic* a=\r\nnd *\n&gt; Tamasic* or baser elements which are the real *Asuras*, the *Rakshas=\r\nas*, *\n&gt; Narakasura* and others. The whole world is within us. The whole co=\r\nsmos can\n&gt; be found in a microscopic form in our own body. *Rama-Ravana-Yud=\r\ndha* and *\n&gt; Tarakasura-Vadha*, and all such Epic wars,--everything is goin=\r\ng on inside\n&gt; us. This Dipavali is thus also a psychological context, where=\r\nin we\n&gt; contemplate in our own selves the holy occasion of self-mastery,\n&gt; =\r\nself-subjugation and self-abnegation leading to the rise of all spiritual\n&gt;=\r\n virtues which are regarded as lustre or radiance emanating from\n&gt; Self-Kno=\r\nwledge. *Bhagavati Mahalakshmi*, the Goddess of prosperity, does\n&gt; not mere=\r\nly mean the Goddess of wealth in a material sense. *Lakshmi* does\n&gt; not mea=\r\nn only gold and silver. *Lakshmi* means prosperity in general,\n&gt; positive g=\r\nrowth in the right direction, a rise into the higher stages of\n&gt; evolution.=\r\n This is the advent of *Lakshmi*. Progress and prosperity are *\n&gt; Lakshmi*.=\r\n In the *Vishnu Purana* we are told if *Narayana* is like the\n&gt; sun, *Laksh=\r\nmi* is like the radiance of the sun. They are inseparable.\n&gt; Wherever *Nara=\r\nyana* is, there is *Lakshmi*. Wherever is divinity, there is\n&gt; prosperity. =\r\nSo on this day of *Dipavali* we worship the Supreme God who is\n&gt; the source=\r\n of all conceivable virtues, goodness and prosperity, which is\n&gt; symbolised=\r\n in illumination, lighting and worship in the form of *Arati* and\n&gt; gay joy=\r\nous attitude and feeling in every respect. So, in short, this is a\n&gt; day of=\r\n rejoicing over the victory of *Sattva* over the lower *Gunas*, the\n&gt; victo=\r\nry of God Himself over the binding fetters of the soul.\n&gt;\n&gt;  *Aano bhadra k=\r\nrtavo yantu vishwatah*\n&gt;

do thou, therefore, O son of Kunti (Arjuna), perform action for tha=\r\nt sake (for sacrifice alone), free from attachment.&quot; (Gita III-9)&lt;/p&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we are born into a particular set up of circumstances which we ca=\r\nll a family, all the conditioning factors of the family are also born toget=\r\nher with us. The tradition of the family grows when we grow. The pattern of=\r\n our character and conduct is entirely determined by the idealogical backgr=\r\nound that is at the very basis of the structure of that particular family. =\r\nWe are born not merely in a family but also in wider circumstances called t=\r\nhe community, nation, world, universe, etc., to all which we owe obligation=\r\ns. Our obligation to a condition into which we are born is sacrifice or=A0&lt;=\r\ni&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0and that is what Bhagavan Sri Krishna speaks of in the above =\r\nverse.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;When we are born, we are born with certain obligations. Wha=\r\nt are these obligations? They are the allegiance that we perforce owe to th=\r\nose factors that are responsible for our birth and maintenance. That is the=\r\n sacrifice which we are called upon to do. In the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;, which are=\r\n antecedent even to the Mahabharata and the Bhagavadgita, we are given the =\r\nfirst primeval concept of sacrifice. Supreme sacrifice is extolled in the=\r\n=A0&lt;i&gt;Veda&lt;/i&gt;, according to which the Absolute itself is the first perform=\r\ner of the=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0and not a=A0&lt;i&gt;Pandit&lt;/i&gt;. The Absolute did the =\r\nfirst=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0and then the others followed. They are only imitatin=\r\ng what the Absolute did, originally.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;What was the sacrifice that t=\r\nhe Absolute did and who was the performer of that sacrifice? Where was the=\r\n=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedi&lt;/i&gt;=A0or the=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna-kunda&lt;/i&gt;=A0for that sacrifice and what =\r\nwas the material that was offered in that sacrifice?=A0&lt;i&gt;&#39;Yajnena Yajn=\r\namayajanta Devah&#39;&lt;/i&gt;, says the=A0&lt;i&gt;Purusha-Sukta&lt;/i&gt;.=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=\r\n=A0was the sacrifice,=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0was offered in=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0by=\r\n=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0for the sake of&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;. Sacrifice was offered in the=\r\n sacrifice, through the sacrifice, for the sake of sacrifice. What do you u=\r\nnderstand from this? You understand nothing, except a jumble of words. Simi=\r\nlar to this enigmatic statement of the=A0&lt;i&gt;Veda&lt;/i&gt;, we have another state=\r\nment in the Bhagavadgita also:=A0&lt;i&gt;&#39;Brahmarpanam Brahmahavir-Brahmagno=\r\nu Brahmana Hutam, Brahmaiva Tena Gantavyam Brahmakarma Samadhina&#39;&lt;/i&gt;. =\r\nBrahman is offering Brahman through Brahman for the sake of Brahman. What d=\r\noes it mean? It seems as confusing as that=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedic Mantra&lt;/i&gt;. But let u=\r\ns remember that this is what sacrifice precisely means. It is a universal i=\r\nnvolvement of factors wherein and whereby we become the property of the who=\r\nle creation. Can you imagine this situation where we become the property of=\r\n everyone in the world! Anyone can demand anything from us, and we must giv=\r\ne it! We have an obligation to everything in this world. That obligation is=\r\n the sacrifice that we are called upon to do. That is the=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/=\r\np&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Our obligation is not merely to our parents, brothers and sisters, =\r\nnot merely to the government of our country that protects us, not merely to=\r\n the planet earth on which we live, not merely to the solar system which gi=\r\nves us light, heat and energy. Oh God! We have got larger demands upon us a=\r\nnd if we can think for a moment the obligations that we really owe to this =\r\nwonderful creation of God, we will not be able to breathe for a moment! Bec=\r\nause we are not able to fulfil all these obligations in a short span of lif=\r\ne, we are reborn. Otherwise we need not be reborn. If we have fulfilled or =\r\ndischarged all our duties in this very life itself, why should we take next=\r\n birth! But, life is short, and also we have not got the least concept of w=\r\nhat obligations we bear or owe to the universe outside. Even when we are ni=\r\nnety years old, this knowledge will not come to us. So, naturally we die wi=\r\nth ignorance. And because of this ignorance we are not able to discharge ou=\r\nr duties properly. Because of the non-discharge of the duties and obligatio=\r\nns properly, we are hurled into transmigration. And so long as we do not un=\r\nderstand the meaning of the sacrifice that we are expected to perform and f=\r\nulfil the obligations that we owe to the conditions of our existence, we ca=\r\nnnot avoid undergoing this process of births and deaths.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;What are =\r\nthe conditions of our existence? Parents are a conditioning factor. They ha=\r\nve given birth to us, they feed us, take care of us and educate us. Society=\r\n is another conditioning factor. You know how much we owe to the society. T=\r\nhough it may not be visible outwardly, invisibly the society protects us, t=\r\nakes care of us and helps us in many ways. The nation and the international=\r\n system help us. The stellar systems also help us. In short, the whole cosm=\r\nos helps us. Therefore, we owe a universal obligation to all things in the =\r\nuniverse. When we go for a walk in the jungles, sometimes a part of our clo=\r\nth gets caught in a thorny bush and when we try to remove a thorn and move =\r\nforward, we will find that another thorn is pricking us from behind. When w=\r\ne try to remove that, here it pricks again, so that we find ourselves unabl=\r\ne to get out of it. When we are freed from one side, we are caught from ano=\r\nther side. Similarly, when we discharge one obligation, we will find that a=\r\nnother obligation has not been discharged. We cannot have an integral visio=\r\nn of things. We are partial, short-sighted people. We have a very narrow vi=\r\nsion of things and it is this narrow vision that is responsible for our bir=\r\nth and death.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;This mysterious law, the law of=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;, oper=\r\nates in the world.=A0&lt;i&gt;&#39;Yajno vai Vishnuh&#39;&lt;/i&gt;--Supreme Narayana H=\r\nimself is called=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;. The term &#39;&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;&#39; signifies =\r\nthe whole of the culture of=A0&lt;i&gt;Bharatavarsha&lt;/i&gt;. If you want one word wh=\r\nich can give us the quintessence of the whole of the culture of India, &#39=\r\n;&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;&#39; is that word. How meaningful it is, we can imagine. Ever=\r\ny cultural pattern and every presupposition of human existence is contained=\r\n in this pregnant term &#39;&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;&#39;, which means the universal sa=\r\ncrifice that the soul performs. The performer of the sacrifice is the soul.=\r\n It is not an=A0&lt;i&gt;Acharya&lt;/i&gt;=A0or a=A0&lt;i&gt;Pandit&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In the=A0&lt;i=\r\n&gt;Anugita&lt;/i&gt;=A0of the Mahabharata, which is a sequel to the Bhagavadgita, t=\r\nhis=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0is described in a very beautiful form. It states what=\r\n=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0actually is. This=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0is going on daily in t=\r\nhis body and it is going on everywhere in the world, outside and inside. It=\r\n is sacrifice of all those factors which tend to tether the soul to the bod=\r\nily tabernacle into the fire of the knowledge of the Absolute. This is call=\r\ned=A0&lt;i&gt;Jnana-Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0which means the offering of knowledge into the fi=\r\nre of Knowledge. Which knowledge is offered into which knowledge? The knowl=\r\nedge of our individual existence in all its aspects is offered in the knowl=\r\nedge of the Supreme Being. The concept of this mysterious=A0&lt;i&gt;Dharma&lt;/i&gt;=\r\n=A0before us cannot be contained in our minds. Our heads will burst if we s=\r\ntart thinking deeply about these implications of our life.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Knowled=\r\nge is too vast. Our life is not long enough to have all the knowledge neces=\r\nsary. The ancient masters, the Seers saw with their premonition, intuition =\r\nor forevision that people cannot contain the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedic&lt;/i&gt;=A0knowledge in =\r\ntheir heads.=A0&lt;i&gt;&#39;Ananta vai Vedah&#39;&lt;/i&gt;--&lt;i&gt;Vedas=A0&lt;/i&gt;are endles=\r\ns or infinite, which means to say knowledge has no limit. People in this=A0=\r\n&lt;i&gt;Kali Yuga&lt;/i&gt;=A0especially are so feeble physically, morally and intelle=\r\nctually, that this truth has to be instilled into their minds through some =\r\nother manner. This is why=A0&lt;i&gt;Vyasa&lt;/i&gt;=A0wrote the great Epic Mahabharata=\r\n. He found out that the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0are of no use to poor human beings=\r\n in this=A0&lt;i&gt;Kali Yuga&lt;/i&gt;. Whatever the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0say would not en=\r\nter our heads, because they contain impersonal scientific knowledge. How ma=\r\nny of us are scientific? We are all ignorant, rustic villagers in our way o=\r\nf thinking. Crude thinking is our habit. Subtle, universal, scientific thin=\r\nking as is contained in the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0is far from us.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;When =\r\nI say the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0are scientific, I am not making a joke. Masters =\r\nlike Swami Dayananda Sarasvati, who founded the=A0&lt;i&gt;Arya Samaj&lt;/i&gt;; Sayana=\r\n, the great commentator of the&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;; Aurobindo, of our own times; th=\r\ne Puri Sankaracharya, the late Bharati Krishna Tirtha;--they all have strug=\r\ngled to point out that every science is contained in the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;. Ev=\r\nen subjects such as aeronautics, ship-building, mathematics of the highest =\r\ntype in differential calculus, infinite calculus,--everything is in the=A0&lt;=\r\ni&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;. Sri Bharati Krishna Tirtha has written a book called &#39;Vedi=\r\nc Mathematics&#39;, and it has been published by the Benares Hindu Universi=\r\nty. The=A0&lt;i&gt;Veda Samhitas=A0&lt;/i&gt;contain the highest reaches of Mathematics=\r\n. Many think that the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0are only some foolish chants of cowh=\r\nerds of Punjab, as British historians tell us. The=A0&lt;i&gt;Aryans&lt;/i&gt;=A0were r=\r\negarded as cowherds grazing their cows in Punjab and blabbering something a=\r\nnd that became the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;. This is the British interpretation of ou=\r\nr culture, which has gone into our heads! The=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0are not blab=\r\nbering of that kind. They are intuitional revelations of ecstatic souls who=\r\n had the vision of the Absolute. And, therefore, this vision-integral conta=\r\nins every type of knowledge--physics, chemistry, biology, sociology, mathem=\r\natics, astronomy, alchemy,=A0&lt;i&gt;Ayurveda&lt;/i&gt;, military science and what not=\r\n. How can we contain all these things? We, therefore, bid good-bye to=A0&lt;i&gt;=\r\nVedas&lt;/i&gt;. So the master Vyasa, Krishna Dvaipayana Vyasa, wrote the Mahabha=\r\nrata and the=A0&lt;i&gt;Puranas&lt;/i&gt;=A0to explain these very impersonal scientific=\r\n truths of the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0in personal Epic style.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;In village=\r\ns some ladies have got a peculiar habit. Suppose a lady wants a Sari. She c=\r\nannot tell directly to her husband, &#39;I want a Sari&#39;. So, she will s=\r\nay: &quot;The neighbour&#39;s wife has purchased a new Sari today; it is ve=\r\nry good, very nice; I saw it myself.&quot; Her husband understands her inte=\r\nntions. He will say: &quot;Why do you describe all these things? All right,=\r\n I will purchase one for you.&quot; And the poor man purchases a Sari. The =\r\nEpics and=A0&lt;i&gt;Puranas&lt;/i&gt;=A0follow a similar indirect way of instructing t=\r\nhe truths. But the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0directly tell the truth openly: &#39;Yo=\r\nu must do this, it is like this.&#39; This is scientific. Science always pl=\r\nainly tells the truth as it is, without any camouflage. The Epics and the=\r\n=A0&lt;i&gt;Puranas&lt;/i&gt;=A0do not say directly that you must be a good man. They s=\r\nay: &#39;Yudhishthira was a good man. His virtue was so immense. He shared =\r\neverything that he had. His conduct was so adventurous that as a result he =\r\ngot so many things.&#39; One who hears this feels: &#39;Oh, I see, then I m=\r\nust also do like that.&#39; These texts are called=A0&lt;i&gt;Suhrit-Sammitas&lt;/i&gt;=\r\n, while the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;=A0are known as=A0&lt;i&gt;Prabhu-Sammitas&lt;/i&gt;. The lat=\r\nter command like a master. Science always commands on principles. The Puran=\r\nas and Epics give stories, ancient history and make us think scientifically=\r\n in an indirect manner, as though with a sugar-coated pill. That is why it =\r\nis said=A0&lt;i&gt;&#39;Bharatam Panchamo Vedah&#39;&lt;/i&gt;. While the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i=\r\n&gt;=A0are supposed to be four, the Mahabharata is the fifth&lt;i&gt;Veda&lt;/i&gt;. It is=\r\n as important as the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;. Sometimes they say, it is even more im=\r\nportant than the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whatever it is, when knowledge ge=\r\nts adulterated through intense sensory activity, weakness of will and lack =\r\nof moral force, the understanding of=A0&lt;i&gt;Dharma&lt;/i&gt;=A0also falls. So we mu=\r\nst have a whip to goad us to the path of=A0&lt;i&gt;Dharma&lt;/i&gt;, spirituality and =\r\nGod-consciousness. The tradition of India, Bharatavarsha, is full of such g=\r\noading whips. While the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vedas&lt;/i&gt;, the Puranas and the Epics may be sa=\r\nid to be direct teachers in an institution or an academy, the culture of In=\r\ndia has also instituted many occasions for bringing home to our mind facts =\r\nof our eternal glory and our duties to God, the world and mankind. We owe t=\r\nhree kinds of duty which are mentioned in the eighteenth chapter of the Bha=\r\ngavadgita&lt;i&gt;, &#39;Yajno danam tapas-chaiva pavanani manishinam&#39;&lt;/i&gt;. T=\r\nhey are=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna, Dana=A0&lt;/i&gt;and=A0&lt;i&gt;Tapas&lt;/i&gt;.=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0itself =\r\ncontains in its meaning all possible knowledge and the mandate on ethics. S=\r\ntill we are told&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;,=A0&lt;i&gt;Dana&lt;/i&gt;=A0and=A0&lt;i&gt;Tapas&lt;/i&gt;=A0constitu=\r\nte the highest necessity of religion. While=A0&lt;i&gt;Tapas&lt;/i&gt;=A0is the duty th=\r\nat we owe to our own selves,=A0&lt;i&gt;Dana&lt;/i&gt;=A0is that which we owe to others=\r\n, and=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0is that we owe to God.=A0&lt;i&gt;Tapas&lt;/i&gt;=A0is austerity=\r\n. We must perform austerity. We must live a very restrained life.=A0&lt;i&gt;Dana=\r\n&lt;/i&gt;=A0is charitable feeling, charitable nature and charitable act in respe=\r\nct of others, while=A0&lt;i&gt;Yajna&lt;/i&gt;=A0is the self-dedication we make of our =\r\nown self wholly and totally to the Supreme Being.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;We have various =\r\noccasions throughout the year to remind us of the threefold duty. They are =\r\ncalled=A0&lt;i&gt;Vratas&lt;/i&gt;, some of which are annual, some monthly and some dai=\r\nly. The Dipavali Vrata is observed every year on the fourteenth day (&lt;i&gt;Cha=\r\nturdasi&lt;/i&gt;) of the dark-fortnight in the month of=A0&lt;i&gt;Kartika&lt;/i&gt;=A0(Octo=\r\nber-November). People take a holy oil bath, put on new clothes, eat delicio=\r\nus dishes. Crackers are burst and lines of light are lit everywhere. There =\r\nis an atmosphere of gaiety and sanctity. Goddess Lakshmi is worshipped and =\r\nDivine grace is invoked. Though there are many stories associated with this=\r\n celebration of Dipavali, the prominent one is the killing of the demon Nar=\r\nakasura by Lord Sri Krishna, while returning to Dwaraka from Indraloka, fro=\r\nm where he brought the=A0&lt;i&gt;Parijata&lt;/i&gt;=A0plant, to fulfil the wishes of S=\r\natyabhama, his consort.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Dipavali festival is regarded as an oc=\r\ncasion particularly associated with an ancient event of Sri Krishna overcom=\r\ning the demoniacal force known as Narakasura, recorded in the Epics and Pur=\r\nanas. After the great victory over Narakasura in a battle, which appears to=\r\n have lasted for long, long days, Sri Krishna with his consort Satyabhama r=\r\neturned to his abode in Dwaraka. The residents of Dwaraka were very anxious=\r\n about the delay caused in Sri Krishna&#39;s returning and it is said that =\r\nthey were worshipping Bhagavati Lakshmi for the prosperity and welfare of e=\r\nveryone and the quick returning of Bhagavan Sri Krishna and Satyabhama. And=\r\n, after Sri Krishna returned, the story goes that he took a bath after appl=\r\nying oil over his body, to cleanse himself subsequent to the very hectic wo=\r\nrk he had to do in the war that ensued earlier. This oil-bath connected wit=\r\nh Sri Krishna&#39;s ritual is also one of the reasons for people necessaril=\r\ny remembering to take an oil-bath on the day known as Naraka Chaturdasi, pr=\r\nior to the Amavasya, when Lakshmi Puja is conducted. Everyone in India reme=\r\nmbers to take an oil-bath on Naraka Chaturdasi in memory of, in honour of, =\r\nBhagavan Sri Krishna&#39;s doing that after the demise of Narakasura. Havin=\r\ng taken the bath, they all joined together in great delight in the grand wo=\r\nrship of Maha-Lakshmi for general prosperity of everyone in Dwaraka. This i=\r\ns the traditional background, as is told to us, of the rites and the worshi=\r\nps connected with Naraka Chaturdasi and Dipavali Amavasya.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;There i=\r\ns a third aspect of it which is called=A0&lt;i&gt;Bali Padya&lt;/i&gt;, the day followi=\r\nng Amavasya. It does not look that Bali Padya festival is directly connecte=\r\nd with Lakshmi Puja or Naraka Chaturdasi. But it has another background alt=\r\nogether, namely, the blessing Narayana, in His incarnation as Vamana, besto=\r\nwed upon the demon-king Bali Chakravarti, whom He subdued when He took a Co=\r\nsmic Form in the Yajnasala of Bali, the details of which we can read in the=\r\n Srimad Bhagavata Mahapurana.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;Bali Chakravarti was himself a great=\r\n devotee, an ideal king and ruler, and having submitted himself to being th=\r\nrown into the nether regions by the pressure of the foot of Narayana in the=\r\n Cosmic Form, it appears he begged of Him to have some occasion to come up =\r\nto the surface of the earth and then be recognised as a devotee of Bhagavan=\r\n Narayana Himself. This recognition, this hallowed memory of Bali Chakravar=\r\nti, is celebrated on the first day of the bright fortnight following the Am=\r\navasya. Bali Puja, Bali Padya are some of the terms used to designate this =\r\noccasion, the day next to Amavasya.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n\n&lt;p&gt;So, the sum and substance of t=\r\nhe message connected with Dipavali is that it is a three day festival, begi=\r\nnning with Naraka Chaturdasi, a day prior to Amavasya; then the main Lakshm=\r\ni worship day, which is Amavasya itself; and the third day which is Bali Pa=\r\ndya connected with the honour bestowed upon Bali Chakravarti as a devotee o=\r\nf Bhagavan Narayana. It is also an occasion for spiritual exhilaration, a l=\r\nighting up of all darkness, socially as well as personally, outwardly and i=\r\nnwardly, for the purpose of allowing an entry of the Supreme Light of God i=\r\nnto the hearts of all people.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;i&gt;Dipavali&lt;/i&gt;=A0means the l=\r\nine of lights.=A0&lt;i&gt;Dipa&lt;/i&gt;=A0is light; and=A0&lt;i&gt;Avali&lt;/i&gt;=A0means line. S=\r\no,=A0&lt;i&gt;Dipavali&lt;/i&gt;=A0or the festival of the line of lights is the celebra=\r\ntion of the rise of Knowledge. It is also the celebration of the victory of=\r\n the=A0&lt;i&gt;Sattvic&lt;/i&gt;=A0or divine elements in us over the=A0&lt;i&gt;Rajasic&lt;/i&gt;=\r\n=A0and=A0&lt;i&gt;Tamasic&lt;/i&gt;=A0or baser elements which are the real=A0&lt;i&gt;Asuras&lt;=\r\n/i&gt;, the=A0&lt;i&gt;Rakshasas&lt;/i&gt;,=A0&lt;i&gt;Narakasura&lt;/i&gt;=A0and others. The whole wo=\r\nrld is within us. The whole cosmos can be found in a microscopic form in ou=\r\nr own body.=A0&lt;i&gt;Rama-Ravana-Yuddha&lt;/i&gt;=A0and=A0&lt;i&gt;Tarakasura-Vadha&lt;/i&gt;, an=\r\nd all such Epic wars,--everything is going on inside us. This Dipavali is t=\r\nhus also a psychological context, wherein we contemplate in our own selves =\r\nthe holy occasion of self-mastery, self-subjugation and self-abnegation lea=\r\nding to the rise of all spiritual virtues which are regarded as lustre or r=\r\nadiance emanating from Self-Knowledge.=A0&lt;i&gt;Bhagavati Mahalakshmi&lt;/i&gt;, the =\r\nGoddess of prosperity, does not merely mean the Goddess of wealth in a mate=\r\nrial sense.=A0&lt;i&gt;Lakshmi&lt;/i&gt;=A0does not mean only gold and silver.=A0&lt;i&gt;Lak=\r\nshmi&lt;/i&gt;=A0means prosperity in general, positive growth in the right direct=\r\nion, a rise into the higher stages of evolution. This is the advent of=A0&lt;i=\r\n&gt;Lakshmi&lt;/i&gt;. Progress and prosperity are=A0&lt;i&gt;Lakshmi&lt;/i&gt;. In the=A0&lt;i&gt;Vis=\r\nhnu Purana&lt;/i&gt;=A0we are told if=A0&lt;i&gt;Narayana&lt;/i&gt;=A0is like the sun,=A0&lt;i&gt;L=\r\nakshmi&lt;/i&gt;=A0is like the radiance of the sun. They are inseparable. Whereve=\r\nr=A0&lt;i&gt;Narayana&lt;/i&gt;=A0is, there is=A0&lt;i&gt;Lakshmi&lt;/i&gt;. Wherever is divinity, =\r\nthere is prosperity. So on this day of=A0&lt;i&gt;Dipavali&lt;/i&gt;=A0we worship the S=\r\nupreme God who is the source of all conceivable virtues, goodness and prosp=\r\nerity, which is symbolised in illumination, lighting and worship in the for=\r\nm of=A0&lt;i&gt;Arati&lt;/i&gt;=A0and gay joyous attitude and feeling in every respect.=\r\n So, in short, this is a day of rejoicing over the victory of=A0&lt;i&gt;Sattva&lt;/=\r\ni&gt;=A0over the lower=A0&lt;i&gt;Gunas&lt;/i&gt;, the victory of God Himself over the bin=\r\nding fetters of the soul.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;+0&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;=\r\n#c00000&quot; size=3D&quot;4&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000bf&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont color=3D&quot;#0000bf&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;arial&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv style=3D&quot;background-color:rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=3D&quot;background-co=\r\nlor:rgb(223,255,191)&quot; face=3D&quot;verdana&quot; color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong=\r\n&gt;Aano bhadra krtavo yantu vishwatah&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;bac=\r\nkground-color:rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=3D&quot;background-color:rgb(223,255=\r\n,191)&quot; color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&quot;Let noble thoughts come t=\r\no me from all directions&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;em&gt;- RIG VEDA&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color:rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/stro=\r\nng&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font style=3D&quot;background-color:rgb(255,255,2=\r\n55)&quot; color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://deosaranbisnath.blogspo=\r\nt.com/&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://deosaranbisnath.blogspot.=\r\ncom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.facebook.com/people/Caribbean-Hindus/10000=\r\n0062834937&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.facebook.com/peop=\r\nle/Caribbean-Hindus/100000062834937&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://jahajeedesi.=\r\nblogspot.com/&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://jahajeedesi.blogsp=\r\not.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;&lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://twitter.com/iTrinidad&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;fo=\r\nnt size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/iTrinidad&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;fo=\r\nnt color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://hinducouncilofthecaribbean.blogspot.=\r\ncom/&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;http://hi=\r\nnducouncilofthecaribbean.blogspot.com/&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://hindustt.blogspot.com/&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;http://hindustt.blogspot.com/&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font c=\r\nolor=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://twitter.com/Chaguanas&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;http://twitter.com/Chaguanas=\r\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.facebook.com/home.php#/profile.php?id=3D634751846&quot; re=\r\nl=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ntd&gt;\n\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:white&quot; widt=\r\nh=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n \n\n    &lt;/div&gt;  \n\n    \n  =\r\n  &lt;div width=3D&quot;1&quot; style=3D&quot;color:white;clear:both&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\t\n\t&lt;/div&gt;\n\t\n\t\n\n\n=\r\n\t\n\n\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\t\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0014853942181c5e790475d21e0a--\r\n\n"}}
