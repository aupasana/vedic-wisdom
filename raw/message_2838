Some places wh=\r\nere I have often found less people and were less &#39;prasiddha&#39; I have found t=\r\nhat serenity and joy. Some exceptions for me=C2=A0were the temple for Rahu =\r\namong the famous Navagraha temples around Kumbakonam and the Lakshmi Narasi=\r\nmha Temple in Namakkal near the Namakkal Anjaneyar. The Mahalakshmi here is=\r\n called the Namagiri Lakshmi and the deity, Lakshmi Narasimhar is so vibran=\r\nt that I could feel strong vibrations and energy fields whenever I visited =\r\nthe temple ( almost once in a year while I was in India) The palms of Swami=\r\n are also red tinged from the blood of Hiranyakasipu as per sthala purana.\n=\r\nThe Rahu temple I always can smell strong flower especially Mogali (or tazh=\r\nampoo as it is called in=C2=A0Tamil)=C2=A0=C2=A0scents when I visited=C2=A0=\r\n the temple at night. The Girikuchambal sannidhi=C2=A0 depicts &#39;sachaamara =\r\nramaavanee sevitha&#39; form of Mother. There is also a sannidhi of=C2=A0Piriya=\r\nni nayaki where=C2=A0I recollect that on Ashtami day the rays of chandra fa=\r\nll exactly into her sannidhi, I think at her feet. I have forgotten the det=\r\nails. The whole temple for me has very strong vibrations and I could feel t=\r\nhem and though sometimes I have been late to other Navagraha temples around=\r\n the Kumbakonam, I have always reached here just as there is either the aft=\r\nernoon or the night puja before closing. I do not know but I have a strange=\r\n affinity to this temple, Namakkal Lakshmi Narasimha Swamy temple and Mantr=\r\nalayam. \nI also do not know why any aspect of Her is to be feared??? Even a=\r\nt her most fierce she is the most benevolent Mother who would never harm He=\r\nr child. I have always felt even the &#39;destructive&#39; aspect full of love and =\r\ncan never imagine My Mother harm or frighten me. But there have been instan=\r\nces when people have experienced &#39;negative energies&#39; in homes and places of=\r\n worship. We have in our teens lived in a house (our own) which had many pi=\r\nctures of Gods and Goddesses, infact a separate room for puja and my mother=\r\n has always been a very spiritual person. I have experienced negative vibra=\r\ntions in that house for years and it was with great difficulty that we sold=\r\n that house . I still cannot fathom how in a house where there is regular p=\r\nooja, homams and prayers that negative energy could still exist. It is stil=\r\nl not very clear to me after decades.

If it&#39;s a feel good factor within or without?\n&gt;\n&gt;If we go t=\r\no the famous temples of India today, it is almost sure that one will find l=\r\not of crowd and resultant noise, gossips, business, cheating, discriminatio=\r\nn etc... etc...\n&gt;can that be criteria for judging the spiritual energy of t=\r\nhe place?\n&gt;\n&gt;my two distinct experiences (external):\n&gt;1) i went to Jagannat=\r\nh Puri in year year 95. when i entered to take Darshan of all the 3 famous =\r\nidols, i was shocked by the dogmatic behavior of the Pandas standing there =\r\nnear the Idols. they almost commanded me to put some money in front of the =\r\nIdol. one can imagine my condition. Instead of focusing on the lord, i was =\r\nangry at them and refused to oblige.\n&gt;\n&gt;2) Once we (group of friends) went =\r\nto &#39;Mota Ambaji&#39; (in Gujarat near Mount Abu). one shopkeeper (who sales puj=\r\nan saamagri) just at the entrance of the famous temple, gave us all the puj=\r\na material in a plate. We made a mistake by not asking him price. After we =\r\ncame back from the temple, he asked us to pay around 1500 Rs per plate. can=\r\n anybody imagine such price?. we have to bargain so much with him that afte=\r\nr that i hardly buy such puja saamgri whenever i go to any temple. for inst=\r\nance if i go to MahaLakshmi Temple of Mumbai, i&#39;ll take 3 lotuses to offer =\r\nMahakaali-Mahalaksh mi-MahaSaraswati and that is all.\n&gt;\n&gt;However I must say=\r\n that the above two bad experiences did not discourage me.\n&gt;\n&gt;Such things a=\r\ns well as few other things like General atmosphere, crowd, noise, beggars, =\r\ndirt, etc=E2=80=A6 are external things IMHO. There is also spiritual energy=\r\n generated by many many pure hearted visitors.\n&gt;\n&gt;Warm regards,\n&gt;\n&gt;Utpal\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Astro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@ ...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste Narsimhaji,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Thanks for sharing your thoughts. T=\r\nhey have helped me a lot on the query. Actually, I recently visited few (no=\r\nt to name any but also including 1 or 2 from your list) places with my pare=\r\nnts. But, my experience was really bad. I could see lot of commercialism an=\r\nd greed invloved amongst everyone there including those in position over th=\r\nere. And spiritualism was difficult to find. I could feel spiritual vibes m=\r\nore outside (slightly away from the main building and crows) the temples th=\r\nan inside. And to my believe, these places would not have been like this al=\r\nways. So, I kept wondering, that if these famous and energised idols have t=\r\nhe power to raise the spiritual energies, then why did &quot;locals&quot; who have al=\r\nways been here, are getting corrupted. But, then probably the tamas energie=\r\ns of people coming day in and out have overpowered or as you say visitors h=\r\nave made the incense disappear over the period of time.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I have one e=\r\nxperience to share, which is somewhat on similar lines. I was in Hardiwar w=\r\nith my parents on a certain &quot;Amavasya&quot;. After taking bath, they started loo=\r\nking for a cow to feed as per the custom. Fortunately or unfortunately, we =\r\ncould found a few (around 10) sitting at a certain place. But, they were su=\r\nrrounded by some 1000 odd people trying to feed them. And per my estimate a=\r\n 10000 people would have already fed them per their &quot;Custom&quot;. Now, does it =\r\nreally make sense to forcibly feed a cow who already had her quota of 3-4 d=\r\nays, probably leading her to have digestion or food poisoning problems. I t=\r\nried to convince my parents not to try to feed the, but could not succeed. =\r\nAnd the whole day felt bad about it.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; In general, whatever holy place=\r\n I have visited, I have hardly found it spiritual enough and have mostly fe=\r\nlt disappointed. Rather, I always happen to see plentiful cases of useless =\r\ngreed which make me feel that to keep whatever goodness is left in one, he =\r\nor she should never visit these places. As they are highly filled with Tama=\r\ns now.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt;&gt; Sriram\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; --- On Thu, 8/10/09, Narasimha=\r\n P.V.R.

At \n&gt;&gt; the same time, some not-so-well- =\r\nknown temples seem to have a powerful divine \n&gt;&gt; presence.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; I was very impressed with the=C3=82=C2=A0Krishna temple \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; in Mayapur=\r\n (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and \n&gt;&gt; Arunachalam=\r\n hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a \n&gt;&gt; tremendo=\r\nus amount of spiritual energy in those places. There are several temples \n&gt;=\r\n&gt; where the idol is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after \n&gt;=\r\n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;.=\r\n I did \n&gt;&gt; not get the same impression at the famous Kalighat temple which =\r\nis also in \n&gt;&gt; Calcutta.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There was one small temple i=\r\nn Tamil Nadu that I was \n&gt;&gt; taken to by a priest who took me to visit about=\r\n 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu \n&gt;&gt; before we did the Shata Chandi homam in=\r\n Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that \n&gt;&gt; temple before and it seemed lik=\r\ne a small temple. The name of the=C3=82=C2=A0form of \n&gt;&gt; the divine Mother=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0present there was a Tamil language name and I did not \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; und=\r\nerstand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my eyes=\r\n \n&gt;&gt; and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazz=\r\nled by a \n&gt;&gt; vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays li=\r\nke Sun. I felt \n&gt;&gt; that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately,=\r\n I do not remember the \n&gt;&gt; name of the place or the goddess, but it is a te=\r\nmple without roof over the \n&gt;&gt; goddess. They tried to put a roof over the g=\r\noddess a few times, but the roof \n&gt;&gt; came down in a fire accident each time=\r\n and they finally decided that the goddess \n&gt;&gt; likes open air and no roof. =\r\nThough we spent only 5 min and left in a hurry, I \n&gt;&gt; was very pleased with=\r\n that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the \n&gt;&gt; name of the te=\r\nmple and goddess.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Like this, I am sure there are many=\r\n temples with a \n&gt;&gt; powerful divine presence across India.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 =\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one \n&gt;&gt; of my best expe=\r\nriences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at \n&gt;&gt; Aalandi ne=\r\nar Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the \n&gt;&gt; u=\r\nnderground chamber there.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt; *=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0 *\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Even the middle of a busy road in India is better \n&gt;&gt;=\r\n for meditating than a temple in USA. These western countries are so filled=\r\n with \n&gt;&gt; rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a good=\r\n amount of \n&gt;&gt; sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place=\r\n to meditate, but my \n&gt;&gt; view is that there is not much left at *some* temp=\r\nles. But some temples are \n&gt;&gt; really good.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If one has=\r\n a chance to spend a few months doing \n&gt;&gt; spiritual sadhana near a temple, =\r\nI suggest the following:\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri=\r\n and Kamakhya in east \n&gt;&gt; India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hil=\r\nls)=C3=82=C2=A0and \n&gt;&gt; Narayana=C3=82=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati)=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, \n&gt;&gt; Dwaraka=C3=82=C2=A0and Girnar mount=\r\nains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan \n&gt;&gt; and Hrishikesh in no=\r\nrth India and Srisailam and Mantralayam=C3=82=C2=A0and Ujjain in \n&gt;&gt; centra=\r\nl India.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There are many other good places, but the ab=\r\nove \n&gt;&gt; come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing and staying th=\r\nere for \n&gt;&gt; several months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a=\r\n spiritual \n&gt;&gt; sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.\n&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best \n&gt;&gt; regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt;&gt; Do \n&gt;&gt; a Short Homam You=\r\nrself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt;&gt; Do \n&gt;&gt; Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: \n&gt;&gt; http://=\r\ngroups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free \n&gt;&gt; Jyotish lessons (MP3): h=\r\nttp://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;&gt; Free \n&gt;&gt; Jyotish software (Windows):=\r\n http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Jyotish \n&gt;&gt; writings: http://groups. ya=\r\nhoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt;&gt; Sri \n&gt;&gt; Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: =\r\nhttp://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- =\r\n\n&gt;&gt; From: \n&gt;&gt; Astro \n&gt;&gt; Seeker \n&gt;&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt;&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 \n&gt;&gt; AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n Holy Places\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; Respected Narsimhaji,\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; I woul=\r\nd like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples \n&gt;&gt; etc) in toda=\r\ny&#39;s time.

Some pl=\r\naces where I have often found less people and were less &#39;prasiddha&#39; I have =\r\nfound that serenity and joy. Some exceptions for me&nbsp;were the temple fo=\r\nr Rahu among the famous Navagraha temples around Kumbakonam and the Lakshmi=\r\n Narasimha Temple in Namakkal near the Namakkal Anjaneyar. The Mahalakshmi =\r\nhere is called the Namagiri Lakshmi and the deity, Lakshmi Narasimhar is so=\r\n vibrant that I could feel strong vibrations and energy fields whenever I v=\r\nisited the temple ( almost once in a year while I was in India) The palms o=\r\nf Swami are also red tinged from the blood of Hiranyakasipu as per sthala p=\r\nurana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The Rahu temple I always can smell strong flower especial=\r\nly Mogali (or tazhampoo as it is called in&nbsp;Tamil)&nbsp;&nbsp;scents wh=\r\nen I visited&nbsp; the temple at night. The Girikuchambal sannidhi&nbsp; de=\r\npicts &#39;sachaamara ramaavanee sevitha&#39; form of Mother. There is also a sanni=\r\ndhi of&nbsp;Piriyani nayaki where&nbsp;I recollect that on Ashtami day the =\r\nrays of chandra fall exactly into her sannidhi, I think at her feet. I have=\r\n forgotten the details. The whole temple for me has very strong vibrations =\r\nand I could feel them and though sometimes I have been late to other Navagr=\r\naha temples around the Kumbakonam, I have always reached here just as there=\r\n is either the afternoon or the night puja before closing. I do not know bu=\r\nt I have a strange affinity to this temple, Namakkal Lakshmi Narasimha Swam=\r\ny temple and Mantralayam. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I also do not know why any aspect of =\r\nHer is to be feared??? Even at her most fierce she is the most benevolent M=\r\nother who would never harm Her child. I have always felt even the &#39;destruct=\r\nive&#39; aspect full of love and can never imagine My Mother harm or frighten m=\r\ne. But there have been instances when people have experienced &#39;negative ene=\r\nrgies&#39; in homes and places of worship. We have in our teens lived in a hous=\r\ne (our own) which had many pictures of Gods and Goddesses, infact a separat=\r\ne room for puja and my mother has always been a very spiritual person. I ha=\r\nve experienced negative vibrations in that house for years and it was with =\r\ngreat difficulty that we sold that house . I still cannot fathom how in a h=\r\nouse where there is regular pooja, homams and prayers that negative energy =\r\ncould still exist. It is still not very clear to me after decades.

Whenever i see writings from Narasimha or from others which ta=\r\nlks about spiritual vibrations, i wonder! If it&#39;s a feel good factor within=\r\n or without?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If we go to the famous temples of India today, it is al=\r\nmost sure that one will find lot of crowd and resultant noise, gossips, bus=\r\niness, cheating, discrimination etc... etc...&lt;BR&gt;can that be criteria for j=\r\nudging the spiritual energy of the place?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;my two distinct experience=\r\ns (external):&lt;BR&gt;1) i went to Jagannath Puri in year year 95. when i entere=\r\nd to take Darshan of all the 3 famous idols, i was shocked by the dogmatic =\r\nbehavior of the Pandas standing there near the Idols. they almost commanded=\r\n me to put some money in front of the Idol. one can imagine my condition. I=\r\nnstead of focusing on the lord, i was angry at them and refused to oblige.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) Once we (group of\n friends) went to &#39;Mota Ambaji&#39; (in Gujarat nea=\r\nr Mount Abu). one shopkeeper (who sales pujan saamagri) just at the entranc=\r\ne of the famous temple, gave us all the puja material in a plate. We made a=\r\n mistake by not asking him price. After we came back from the temple, he as=\r\nked us to pay around 1500 Rs per plate. can anybody imagine such price?. we=\r\n have to bargain so much with him that after that i hardly buy such puja sa=\r\namgri whenever i go to any temple. for instance if i go to MahaLakshmi Temp=\r\nle of Mumbai, i&#39;ll take 3 lotuses to offer Mahakaali-Mahalaksh mi-MahaSaras=\r\nwati and that is all.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However I must say that the above two bad expe=\r\nriences did not discourage me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Such things as well as few other thin=\r\ngs like General atmosphere, crowd, noise, beggars, dirt, etc=E2=80=A6 are e=\r\nxternal things IMHO. There is also spiritual energy generated by many many =\r\npure hearted visitors.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Warm regards,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Di=\r\nm&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dno=\r\nfollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, Astro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@ ...&gt; wr=\r\note:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Narsimhaji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks for sharin=\r\ng your thoughts. They have helped me a lot on the query. Actually, I recent=\r\nly visited few (not to name any but also including 1 or 2 from your list) p=\r\nlaces with my parents. But, my experience was really bad. I could see lot o=\r\nf commercialism and greed invloved amongst everyone there including those i=\r\nn position over there. And spiritualism was difficult to find. I could feel=\r\n spiritual vibes more outside (slightly away from the main building and cro=\r\nws) the temples than inside. And to my believe, these places would not have=\r\n been like this always. So, I kept wondering, that if these famous and ener=\r\ngised idols have the power to raise the spiritual energies, then\n why did &quot;=\r\nlocals&quot; who have always been here, are getting corrupted. But, then probabl=\r\ny the tamas energies of people coming day in and out have overpowered or as=\r\n you say visitors have made the incense disappear over the period of time.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have one experience to share, which is somewhat on simil=\r\nar lines. I was in Hardiwar with my parents on a certain &quot;Amavasya&quot;. After =\r\ntaking bath, they started looking for a cow to feed as per the custom. Fort=\r\nunately or unfortunately, we could found a few (around 10) sitting at a cer=\r\ntain place. But, they were surrounded by some 1000 odd people trying to fee=\r\nd them. And per my estimate a 10000 people would have already fed them per =\r\ntheir &quot;Custom&quot;. Now, does it really make sense to forcibly feed a cow who a=\r\nlready had her quota of 3-4 days, probably leading her to have digestion or=\r\n food poisoning problems. I tried to convince my parents not to try to feed=\r\n the, but could not succeed. And the whole day felt bad\n about it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; In general, whatever holy place I have visited, I have hardly foun=\r\nd it spiritual enough and have mostly felt disappointed. Rather, I always h=\r\nappen to see plentiful cases of useless greed which make me feel that to ke=\r\nep whatever goodness is left in one, he or she should never visit these pla=\r\nces. As they are highly filled with Tamas now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best Regard=\r\ns,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sriram&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; --- On Thu, 8/10/09, Narasimha P.V=\r\n.R.

At &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the same time, some not=\r\n-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine &lt;BR&gt;&gt; presence.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was very impressed with the=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\nKrishna temple &lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;&gt; in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is =\r\nthere), Girnar hills in Gujarat and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Arunachalam hills in Tiruvanna=\r\nmalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; tremendous amount of s=\r\npiritual energy in those places. There are several temples &lt;BR&gt;&gt; where t=\r\nhe idol is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ra=\r\nmakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I d=\r\nid &lt;BR&gt;&gt; not get the same impression at the famous Kalighat temple which=\r\n is also in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Calcutta.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; \n&lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; taken=\r\n to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never he=\r\nard of that &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; temple before and it seemed like a small temple.=\r\n The name of the=C3=82&nbsp;form of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the divine Mother=C3=82&nbsp;p=\r\nresent there was a Tamil language name and I did not &lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;&=\r\ngt; understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed =\r\nmy eyes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol=\r\n, I was dazzled by a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; vision of a very fierce goddess whose face wa=\r\ns emiting rays like Sun. I felt &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that there was a powerful presence=\r\n there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; name of the place or =\r\nthe goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; goddess. The=\r\ny tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof &lt;BR&gt;&gt; c=\r\name down in a fire accident each time and they finally decided that the god=\r\ndess &lt;BR&gt;&gt; likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and le=\r\nft in a hurry, I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was very pleased with that temple. Someone from T=\r\namil Nadu probably knows the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; name of the temple and goddess.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; \n&lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Like this, I am sure there =\r\nare many temples with a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; powerful divine presence across India.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; \n&lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Apart from the Kaali temp=\r\nle at Dakshineshwar, one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of my best experiences when meditating wa=\r\ns at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Aalandi near Pune.

Visiting a temple o=\r\nnce is one thing and staying there for &lt;BR&gt;&gt; several months while mainta=\r\nining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sadhana (like homam=\r\n or japam) there is quite another.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dh5&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best &lt;BR&gt;&gt; regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedica=\r\nst/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://rologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;rologer.org/&lt;/A&gt; homam&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://rol=\r\noger.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;rologer.org/&lt;/A&gt; tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nSpirituality: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D=\r\n_blank&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://yahoo.com/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow targ=\r\net=3D_blank&gt;yahoo.com/&lt;/A&gt; group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotis=\r\nh lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_b=\r\nlank&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish=\r\n software (Windows): &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow targe=\r\nt=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://rologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dno=\r\nfollow target=3D_blank&gt;rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish &lt;BR&gt;&gt; writings: &lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A=\r\n&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://yahoo.com/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;yahoo.com/&lt;/=\r\nA&gt; group/JyotishWri tings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jagannath Centre (SJC) websi=\r\nte: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://=\r\nwww.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://nath.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blan=\r\nk&gt;nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Original Mes=\r\nsage ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Astro &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Seeker &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: vedic=\r\n-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 20=\r\n09 9:11 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Holy Places&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Respected\n Narsimhaji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous te=\r\nmples &lt;BR&gt;&gt; etc) in today&#39;s time.
