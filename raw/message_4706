Though religion usually stays th=\r\ne same, it CAN change. Nationality can of course change too. Job, skills, e=\r\nxternal nature, looks, gender, even yoni (human, cow, goat, chicken, tiger =\r\netc) can all change from birth to birth.\n \nBasically, the seed of one&#39;s new=\r\n birth is formed at the time of one&#39;s death. As one&#39;s connection is severed=\r\n with the body, the last desires/thoughts/ponderings of the mind become the=\r\n seed for the next life. Nature chooses for one a future course that allows=\r\n one to pursue those desires, as much as allowed by one&#39;s previous karmas a=\r\nnd debts.\n \nIf one is able to not entertain ANY desire as one element after=\r\n another evaporates in one&#39;s existence, one becomes liberated. All the spir=\r\nitual sadhana we do is a dress rehearsal.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; when we=\r\n see you again and do you know how we\n&gt; shall recognize you, IF WE EVER MEE=\r\nT YOU?\n \nIf I and you like each other and your rebirth and my rebirth meet =\r\neach other, they will start off taking a liking to each other. If I and you=\r\n dislike each other and your rebirth and my rebirth meet each other, they w=\r\nill start off disliking each other. This will happen without either being c=\r\nonsciously aware of who one was and who the other person was, in the last l=\r\nife.\n \nInstead, if your question is how we can recognize that so and so per=\r\nson is a rebirth of Swami Vivekananda, so and so person is a rebirth of Par=\r\namahamsa Yogananda etc, the answer is complex.\n \nThe reborn person may not =\r\nlook like the old person or do similar work or have much *external* similar=\r\nity. So it is difficult to &quot;recognize&quot; one. After all, Rama advocated eka p=\r\natni vrata (one wife principle), while Krishna had thousands of wives. Rama=\r\n was a great warrior and killed Ravana in the biggest war of his times. Kri=\r\nshna was a key player in the biggest war of his time, but did not take a we=\r\napon at all. The game can be diffent in each coming..\n \n*        *        *=\r\n\n \nWhen it comes to recognizing the rebirth of a great soul, it can become =\r\na trap.\n \nRamakrishna explicitly told Sarada Mata that he would be back aft=\r\ner 100 years and that everybody else who came with him would have to come b=\r\nack with him. When Sarada Mata and Lakshmi Devi protested, he said they did=\r\n not have a choice! Even Swami Vivekananda said once in USA, &quot;I have to com=\r\ne back once more. The Master said I am to come back once more with him&quot;. Wh=\r\nen questioned &quot;you have to come back because Shri Ramakrishna says so&quot;, he =\r\nreplied, &quot;souls like that have great power, Madam&quot;. On another occasion, Ra=\r\nmakrishna said that people would get liberated en masse during his next com=\r\ning and that would be the last opportunity for a long time to come.\n \nInter=\r\nestingly, two good saints claimed to be re-incarnations of Ramakrishna sinc=\r\ne then. One of them is wrong (or perhaps both!). Another good saint suggest=\r\ned that she is the re-incarnation of Sarada Mata. Satya Sai Baba said that =\r\nhe identified a particular young man as the reincarnation of Swami Vivekana=\r\nnda. Ramakrishna was surrounded by Sarada Mata and more than twenty discipl=\r\nes of a very high caliber and different aptitudes. Together, they nearly mo=\r\nulded the direction of spiritual India for the next century. None of the cl=\r\naimants of rebirthhood are surrounded by people of such caliber or fit the =\r\nbill.\n \nThus, there can be false claimants to the rebirthhood of a great so=\r\nul! It is not that they are lying. They may simply be deluding themselves a=\r\nnd of course ego is the root of delusion!\n \nIn fact, is it necessary to rec=\r\nognize whether X is a rebirth of Y, given that X and Y are different and pl=\r\nay a different game? A small discussion on this point vis-a-vis Ramakrishna=\r\n Paramahamsa&#39;s example can be found in:\n \nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom/message/807\n \n*        *        *\n \nThough external factors like =\r\nnationality, religion, name, job, looks, gender etc can change, some intern=\r\nal factors may remain the same. Moreover, who one likes, who one dislikes, =\r\nwhat values one is attracted to internally, etc, may remain essentially the=\r\n same.\n \nFor example, suppose rajput king Prithviraj was reborn as Muslim e=\r\nmperor Akbar (as said by Vimalananda). One was a Hindu and the other was a =\r\nMuslim. However, both were very brave, unafraid of death, inherently spirit=\r\nual, had a refined taste in fine arts and had deep conviction. The previous=\r\n connections with rajputs resulted in Akbar being born and raised when his =\r\nmother was hiding at a rajput household, before moving to Delhi. Despite be=\r\ning a Muslim, he actually helped the Hindu causes (to the extent possible a=\r\nt that time) by putting an end to barbaric practices like killing defeated =\r\nHindu kings and all Hindu priests in conquered places. He promoted acceptan=\r\nce of other faiths, canceled pilgrimage taxes on Hindus and even came up wi=\r\nth his own religion of humanity towards the end of his life by integrating =\r\nvarious religions. In one life, he tried to save India from invading barbar=\r\nians. In another, he was born as a cultured man amid barbarians and tried t=\r\no save India by changing the ways of his own people. There is a subtle cont=\r\ninuity in the agenda at a deeper level!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish S=\r\noftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual ma=\r\nnuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org=\r\n\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish wr=\r\nitings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n---------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n \n--- In JyotishGroup@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;rohinicrystal&quot; &lt;jyotish_vani@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Lokesh_ji,\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; As nearly ALL of do except this &quot;BABAJI&quot; Character described in Lahiri M=\r\nahashay (no connection with the ayanamshaa that is causing lot of problems =\r\nfor many!), Yukteshwar and Yognanda and Kriya Yoga -- shall probably die an=\r\nd hopefully be born again -- here is a simple question from a simpleton:\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; After you die, what would be your name and religion and nationality, whe=\r\nn we see you again and do you know how we shall recognize you, IF WE EVER M=\r\nEET YOU?\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not being FLIPPANT at all but just reminding you and mys=\r\nelf how evanescent each of us truly ARE!\n&gt; \n&gt; Rohiniranjan\n\n\n"}}
