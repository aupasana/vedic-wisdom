From what I understand, you are *seeking* the &quot;companion=\r\nship&quot; of an Apsara. I am not sure if the mantra and sadhana you are looking=\r\n at is suitable for that.

Of course, those mantras do not mention Rambha, Uravashi, Menaka, Tilot=\r\ntama etc, who are more popular in folklore. The list of Gandharvas and asso=\r\nciated Apsaras is instructive. For example, Agni (fire) is taken as a Gandh=\r\narva and Oshadhis (curative properties or herbs) as his Apsaras; Surya (Sun=\r\n) is taken as a Gandharva and Marichis (particles/specks of light/lustre) a=\r\ns his Apsaras; Chandra (Moon - mind) is taken as a Gandharva and Nakshatras=\r\n (stars - keepers of karmas) as his Apsaras.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Interesting one is tha=\r\nt offerings are made to kAma (desire), a Gandharva, and to Aadhis, his Apsa=\r\nras!! While vyAdhi (vi+Adhi) means a physical disease, Adhi is a mental dis=\r\nease/agony/disrurbance! Ayurveda talks about how vyAdhi arises from Adhi.

Assuming Apsaras=\r\n cannot come to us in physical form at all, then how is it that our Puranas=\r\n are full of incidents like Rishis marrying Apsaras, Apsaras giving birth t=\r\no children due to their physical union with Rishis, etc.? Even some great k=\r\nings are known to have had the company of Apsaras. For example, Emperor Pur=\r\nurava was seduced by Urvashi Apsara. She lived with him for one year, and t=\r\nhen disappeared, leaving him distressed. How all this can be explained? Any=\r\n insightful ideas from you learned ones pertaining to these incidents would=\r\n be very helpful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vernman_1976=\r\n&quot; &lt;vernman1976@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; dear sir..from what i understand from ce=\r\nrtain serious tantrics i met....they told me that these beings cant come to=\r\n you in a physical form at all....and if you r doing these type of sadhanas=\r\n without a proper guru chances are that nothing would happen at all.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you will be far better off with a human companion....and gain far more=\r\n doing normal worship.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and dont trust what you come across on th=\r\ne net on apsaras and yakshinis.a whole lot of male fantasies get carried aw=\r\nay with the nonsense being portrayed.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with regards.....and god b=\r\nless.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sillylallypally&quot; &lt;sillyl=\r\nallypally@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sir,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Thanks for your kind reply.
