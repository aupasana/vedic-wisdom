You are lucky to have a conscience that guides you \ncorrectly. Listen to it and overcome fear, shame, embarrasment etc.\n\nEmotions like fear, embarassment, pride, sadness, anger, desire etc are all \nnatural to us. Cutting them off completely will take a long time. But one \ncan atleast try to learn to not dwell on them for too long. Normally, when a \nthought like embarassment or fear or anger or pride disturbs the mental \nequilibrium, it will linger in the mind for a while. It will not go away \nquickly. Try to learn to move on, without protesting or fighting with such \nthoughts. Take notice of the thought and move on without over-analyzing it. \nDon&#39;t feel great or bad about any thought. Let the thought come and get its \ntwo seconds of space in your mind and then move on. Remember the analogy of \na heckler I gave in a mail before. The distracting thoughts are like \nhecklers. Do not fight with them or reason with them. Notice them, ignore \nthem and move on.\n\nWhen you do a sadhana, do not worry too much about the results. Having the \nresults or some expectations on the mind is an unnecessary distraction. If \nyou consciously (but not violently or with a sense of shame or anger or \ndisappointment) steer you mind away from such negative thoughts during your \nsadhana, your sadhana will become fruitful sooner or later.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;arunishasengupta&quot; &lt;arunishasengupta@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, February 25, 2009 10:26 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Offerings that don&#39;t burn\n\n\n&gt; Dear PVR Sir,\n&gt;\n&gt; I had read on this before through your correspondences and have been\n&gt; adviced as well on this.\n&gt;\n&gt; This happened to me today...I had some offerings...especially a\n&gt; large chunk of wood that did not burn in the last homa that I did.\n&gt; Further to which I had some troubles which were emotionally\n&gt; disturbing. Considering your reflections on the same, I was sanguine\n&gt; that may be those emotional disturbances were a result of certain\n&gt; karmas accelerating and arriving before time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hence i was a little scared and tensed...and what was on priority\n&gt; today while doing the homa was to burn those unburnt portions.\n&gt; Interestingly...I sat to do the homa...did my sankalpa...ahutis\n&gt; started and all that...when i heard this distinct voice\n&gt; (admonishingly)from within me (i guess) which said &quot;your priority is\n&gt; not me...but burning off that piece of wood?&quot;. Now this was\n&gt; something that embarassed me to the core...\n&gt;\n&gt; I said sorry...and went on to concentrate on the task at\n&gt; hand...though could not fully concentrate partly because i was still\n&gt; apprehensive of the offerings were properly burning or not and\n&gt; partly because I was still reeling from embarassment.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is what I wanted to share with you and also the members of the\n&gt; forum\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Arunisha\n\n\n"}}
