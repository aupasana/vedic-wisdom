Even if you leave your\n&gt; &gt;&gt; room with &quot;Black Sha=\r\ndes&quot; would be fine and actually more beautiful :)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ***\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Answers to =\r\nyour questions:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 1) YES. It is portable. Every day I adjust it nea=\r\nr my window and after\n&gt; &gt;&gt; finishing homam, i take it back little inside so=\r\n that window can be closed.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I am able to adjust it myself alone in jus=\r\nt a few *seconds*.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2) It is made of G.I Sheets (Galvanized Iron) =\r\nof 22 Gauge. This was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; manufactured by a Local EPC contracting company =\r\ndealing in AC Duct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; installation. A Technical Supervisor of that compan=\r\ny is my close family\n&gt; &gt;&gt; friend. He did this for me. I suggest checking wi=\r\nth any Restaurants. They\n&gt; &gt;&gt; all are having such arrangements and they wou=\r\nld be able to help you to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; contact such manufacturers.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 3) YES=\r\n, because it is a Metal (GI Sheet) it gets quite heated up. One can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; no=\r\nt touch during Homam. However, it also cools down quickly. Within half an\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; hour after Homam is finished, temperature of the chimney comes down to =\r\nroom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; temperature.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 4) It has a Metallic FAN at the end. I was=\r\n starting that FAN only when\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Fire goes of and lot of Smoke is generate=\r\nd. Reasons are as follows:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; i)The fan is powerful and makes a lot of no=\r\nise which disturbs\n&gt; &gt;&gt; concentration.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ii) In the beginning, when Fire=\r\n is very small, the powerful exhaust by the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; fan, disturbed the flames =\r\nand sometimes extinguished it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 1ii) When Fire is there in the Homam, o=\r\nne need not worry about smoke\n&gt; &gt;&gt; handling. the reason is that the smoke n=\r\naturally travels upward and it is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; automatically guided to the exit of =\r\nthe chimney. Once the fire becomes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; strong, it generates vacuum around =\r\nHomam kundam area and starts pulling\n&gt; &gt;&gt; outside air. For instance, smoke =\r\nfrom incense stick (Agarbatti), though\n&gt; &gt;&gt; outside of chimney and quite fa=\r\nr away, actually gets diverted into the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Chimney via square opening at =\r\nthe bottom. Hence during homam, FAN is not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; required.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; iv) Now=\r\n very important thing. I used fan for many months (only at the end\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of =\r\nHomas). One day my fear proved right. Due to heat of chimney, the cable\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; of the Fan got burnt and there was a short-circuit. mccb tripped. Since t=\r\nhen\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I am not using the Fan. You may have to go for Heat resistant cabl=\r\ne for the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; FAN if you wish to use it but i am fine without using the fa=\r\nn in my chimney.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Actually without Fan, The whole arrangement will beco=\r\nme much Lighter and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; much easier to handle. Please also do not forget t=\r\no make a support. You can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; see that in pictures which I have loaded. Su=\r\npport is a separate part\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (Please check the Picture of Fan which i=\r\n have added in the Photo section)\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If you have further queries, pl=\r\nease do not hesitate to ask.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Girish Sundaram &lt;gisundar@&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Namaskaram Phatakji,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You know what I am fac=\r\ned with the same problem that you had (and I am\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sure many\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; other=\r\ns doing regular homam do)..

I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; remember\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; different fears i was having i=\r\nn my mind. I was then staying as a paying\n&gt; &gt;&gt; guest\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with a family. =\r\nthough i had a separte room, i was not sure if they would\n&gt; &gt;&gt; allow\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n me to do something related to fire. that was the main worry. then there\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; was self\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doubt concerning my ability to perform Homam but I decid=\r\ned to perform\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and did\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the first Homam which was Maha Ganapati h=\r\nomam on 1st day of Ashwin\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Navaraatri. I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; remember that i took me=\r\n around 2.5 hours total including all the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; preparation\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; after tha=\r\nt rest of the 8 days, i performed Chandi Homams. each Chandi\n&gt; &gt;&gt; homam too=\r\nk\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; around 4 hours. I remember that on the Ashtami day, some of My\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; colleagues with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; family came to see my chandi Homam and they told m=\r\ne that the smoke was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; even\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; visible in the ground floor (The Apar=\r\ntment i was staying was on 4th) and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; were nice smell every=\r\n where. The interesting thing is that Old lady of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; family ac=\r\ntually co-operated with me. she used to help me in cutting Dray\n&gt; &gt;&gt; coconu=\r\nt\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in to small peices with knife. I cut my finger on several occasion=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt;&gt; while\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cutting coconuts for chandi homam. I used to offer the =\r\nblood stained\n&gt; &gt;&gt; coconut\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; peices in Chandi Homas.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My =\r\nall previous fears thus proved absolutely Non-existent. From the very\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nfirst\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Homam, It was a smooth ride. I was exahusted after Navaratri a=\r\nnd could\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; continue and there was a break of a week or so. Th=\r\nen again i started\n&gt; &gt;&gt; daily Maha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Ganapti Homam while learnt the te=\r\nchnic of breaking Dry coconut halves by\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; crushing it with both p=\r\nalms.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; After few months, I had to look for another Sharing Apa=\r\nrtment. I tried\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to search\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for it. few families rejected when i =\r\nput the condition of doing Homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; everyday.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at last One christia=\r\nn family agreed for that. I paid bigger amount but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; they\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; allowed=\r\n me to do homam and i continued there for around 3 months. during\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; time i also took vow to do homam and Chadni Path everyday for 1 yea=\r\nr.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; after 3 months, i started searching for my own separate Re=\r\nntal Apartment\n&gt; &gt;&gt; because\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; my family was joining me. Again the same=\r\n concern (Prime) is to search\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Apartment where there is no o=\r\nbstacle to do Homam. I got a brand new\n&gt; &gt;&gt; apartment. I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; observed th=\r\ne flat and finalised the dealing. continued Homam every day\n&gt; &gt;&gt; for 1\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; year. The whole flat became black. even the Home applicances liem\n&gt; &gt;&gt; r=\r\nefrigerator\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; etc.. were covered with black dust of Homa smoke. clothe=\r\ns in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wardrobe,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Openings of Central A/c etc... were all fill=\r\ned with black dust. My whole\n&gt; &gt;&gt; brand\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; new apartment became dark du=\r\ne to the Homam. Smoke particles travelled to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; my\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lungs and throa=\r\nt and i started coughing badly. I suffered with severe\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cough for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; many months and there was pressure from near ones to stop Homam or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a=\r\ntleast\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; perform it once every week. But there was lot of determinatio=\r\nn provided\n&gt; &gt;&gt; by *some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; power* which i like to call as &quot;Mother&quot;.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; After 1 year in that Apartment, i started serching different pl=\r\nace. I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; searched\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; whole area and was looking for a apartment whic=\r\nh also has Balcony so\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that My\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; homam goes smoothly without nmaki=\r\nng my whole aprtment look black and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; there are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; no more complaint=\r\ns from my wife .\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I could not get one such perfect place which gives =\r\nme a Blacony and at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the same\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; time there are no buidlings in fro=\r\nnt which can observe me doing homam in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; balcony\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and make a insta=\r\nnt complaint to police and/or fire Brigade. Balcony was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; very\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; co=\r\nmfirtable and required option so that i can do it there and smoke\n&gt; &gt;&gt; hand=\r\nling\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; becomes very easy but at the same time it is also that much ris=\r\nky\n&gt; &gt;&gt; because any\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; road-side person can complain seeing smoke commi=\r\nng out.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Finally i got one aprtment without balcony but with a specia=\r\nl location.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; When i\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; vacated the previous apartment, the owner&#39;e =\r\nrepresentative was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; shell-shocked\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; looking at the condition of th=\r\ne apartment :) He told me over Phone -\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Aaap Kya\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; karata tha fla=\r\nt me?&quot;. He then deducted 1000 AED from my deposit for the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; compensati=\r\non. I happily agreed because i knew that it was a great deal\n&gt; &gt;&gt; instaed\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; of going to police station.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In new Apartment (current o=\r\nne), security is very tight. But I decided to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; make an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; arrangeme=\r\nnt so that i do not *spoil* condition of the Apartment. hence i\n&gt; &gt;&gt; came\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; out with the Idea of Chimney. (Please see the more pictures in photo\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; section)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and started doing Homam. Though the chimney is visible=\r\n to neighbours and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; other\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; flat owners, no body has complained ti=\r\nll now. neither to police nor to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; security\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; personnel. Only once =\r\nSecurity person cautiuoned me. I stopped for a few\n&gt; &gt;&gt; days and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; sta=\r\nrted as usual. It is going on till today. I do not know about\n&gt; &gt;&gt; tomorrow=\r\n but i\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; do not worry. becuase after 2.5 years of experience, it is mo=\r\nre than\n&gt; &gt;&gt; clear to me\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that It is not I who is arranging all these=\r\n but there is Mother behind\n&gt; &gt;&gt; all\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; these. SHE is making my road cl=\r\near so that i can perform Homam as i\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wish.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne moral of the story is that if you genuinely desire to perform\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Homam/=\r\nHavan,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; then It will be done.

All the fears will break like Papads once you start walkin=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt;&gt; over\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; them to do homam. i can swear for it!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No o=\r\nwner will kick you out, No neighbour will call 9-1-1 and even if\n&gt; &gt;&gt; that\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happens, there will open a way!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; PS: Forgive me for spellings and Grammar!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;astro_student75&quot; &lt;astro.sishya@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks very much for =\r\nthe photo.
