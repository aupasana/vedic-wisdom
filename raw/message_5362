I am=\r\n\n\n&gt;just highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetarian too. We &gt;should un=\r\nderstand that we may be right but we should realize that &gt;it does not &gt;nece=\r\nssarily mean other person is not right.\n\n\n\nMy views are there on this subje=\r\nct in archives. I wanted to stay away but still inspired to write at least =\r\none message on the same.\n\n\n\n1) Using Arguments based on science, BV, so man=\r\ny of researches and plenty of informations available on the Internet, One w=\r\nill never be able to come to a definitive conclusions.\n\n\n\n2) I never argue =\r\nwith people (even when I was aggressive and passionate about the Idea of ve=\r\ngetarian food) with the above basis.\n\nWhatever said and done, people will c=\r\nontinue eating meat, eggs, Fish, Other seafood and probably Human flash as =\r\nwell. I have, with experience, understood that there is no point in arguing=\r\n with people giving various Data. Each side will have their own arguments, =\r\nown sets of Data and own Counter Ideas to prove their point.\n\n\n\n3) Instead =\r\nI appeal their conscious! I tell people around me, whenever the Topic comes=\r\n up, only one simple thing - &quot;I dont want to kill for filling up my Stomach=\r\n&quot; and I say it from my heart. I tell people that Put a knife edge on your o=\r\nwn Throat or Cut a finger only a little, feel the pain and now realize the =\r\nPlight of a butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or a buffalo or a...., Suf=\r\nfocate yourself by closing Nose & Mouth and see after only a few seconds, h=\r\now you pent for the Air and Now realize the &quot;Chhatpataahat&quot; of a fish force=\r\nd out of water.\n\n\n\nAnd all these, because one wish to fill the stomach or s=\r\natisfy cravings of a habitual palate or both. Even vegetarians have their c=\r\nravings of spice and other food stuff but the very vital difference is that=\r\n such craving does not need killing!\n\n\n\n4) Just to give a result, One of co=\r\nlleagues, who is a Srilankan, has left eating meat since 6 Months now and s=\r\nurely, one of the reasons for his leaving meat is because I told my views h=\r\nim a few times when such discussions came up and I even told him that you a=\r\nre a Buddhist, the religion of Non-Injury and see what has happened to that=\r\n very Idea. Hats-off to him for he really seems to have thought about it an=\r\nd dared to change his swabhava which is so very difficult.\n\nJust to clarify=\r\n, I do not hesitate to express my views even to Muslims and others and at l=\r\neast, this idea is appreciated by them even if grudgingly. The Hard core me=\r\nat eaters are also taken a back with this idea. All though they know from t=\r\nheir hearts of hearts, it comes as a shock even to them when somebody boldl=\r\ny brings that up. Most of us are like a cat that drinks the milk with close=\r\nd eyes. The Idea would have gone in their mind and that is enough. One day =\r\nprobably it will germinate.\n\n\n\n5) Finally, The point is not to say that thi=\r\ns side is good and that side is bad. It&#39;ll be a foolish and unpalatable con=\r\nclusion. It is to just appeal the inside human of each individual, It is to=\r\n appeal the rational Intelligence of an Individual, It is to appeal the hea=\r\nrt of a person and if that is not suffice to our ultra-hardened heart then =\r\na final reminder of &quot;Law of Cause and effect -The Law of Karma&quot; at least to=\r\n those of us who believe in Natures unfailing governance. And that is the f=\r\ninal Idea.\n\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\n\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;Dr. A.

Please point out my mistakes I=\r\n will make in this process.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; We are trying to discuss three points he=\r\nre\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; 1) Choosing a dietary habit\n\n&gt; 2) Dependence of Human population =\r\non Non-veg sources of nutrition\n\n&gt; 3) bioavailability or BV of Non veg vs V=\r\neg food.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I commented on two points \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; 1) Choosing a dietary hab=\r\nit \n\n&gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sources of nutrition\n\n&gt;=\r\n \n\n&gt; 1) Choosing a Dietary habit\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; One should choose his dietary habit=\r\n based on his varna (aptitude and attitude) and goal in his life. He should=\r\n not bother what the BV or other factor or research says. For an athlete, E=\r\nggs are important part of his training. and for a person seeking spirituali=\r\nty one should stick to vegetarian food unless he is able to rise above the =\r\ndifference in veg and nonveg. I agree with Narasimha Ji about this point.\n\n=\r\n&gt; \n\n&gt; In some diseases Non veg sources play an very important role (Althoug=\r\nh not a necessasity) like in Albumin deficiency two eggs per day can save a=\r\n person from costly (3000Rs per Inj) Albumin Injections. In TB, Soup made o=\r\nf goat meat do wonders. Ayurveda also recommend it strongly Charak Samhita)=\r\n etc.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sources of nutrit=\r\nion\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I agree with the link provided in this discussions. Books and ar=\r\nticles by Peta members are far more convincing for switching to Veg sources=\r\n. I can also provide tens of links and book reference which oppose their vi=\r\new. Honestly, I do not believe each and every information on net and not ev=\r\nery book written about nutirtion, just like astrology. Let us leave this de=\r\nbate aside and look at other aspect of it.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; By &#39;Practically impossibl=\r\ne&#39; I meant the cost factor and demand/supply factor. In India (Leave other =\r\nhigh Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45% people are Non vegetarian =\r\nand about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied by Non veg sources. Currently=\r\n, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (including gram soyabean, pu=\r\nlses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nuts (include almonds cashew e=\r\ntc - Costs needn&#39;t mention), Dairy products (Milk being 30-40 Rs per Kg), G=\r\nrains (cheapest sources but not a very complete source), \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; In last tw=\r\no years, their demand rose by 15-20 % but their price rose by 40-60%. even =\r\nat current price, 60 % of population can not afford a complete balanced die=\r\nt as recommended by Experts which include 250 Ml of milk, 50-70 gms of legu=\r\nmes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per person, along with grains =\r\nand roughage etc (These are approx minimum quantities. Different sources ma=\r\ny quote different quantities). There is average family size of 5 and averag=\r\ne family income is 200 Rs per day! And nutrition is not the only thing need=\r\ned in our life!!! Lot of other expenditures are there\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Even at curren=\r\nt prices, 60% population can not afford balanced diet. If additional 40% is=\r\n included in demand of veg sources, price may rise another 100% and I need =\r\nnot to explain what will happen at that time.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Sir, I am not advocati=\r\nng Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, even for milk I prefer=\r\n a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can not expect no crueli=\r\nty even for milk if you buy it from market and do not produce it yourself)\n=\r\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Again, I think and believe that practically it is impossible to shif=\r\nt all the population to veg sources especially when the agriculture land is=\r\n decreasing day by day because of many reasons)\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; 3) Bioavailability o=\r\nr BV of different sources\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; It is always a questionable point. because=\r\n again sections supporting vegetarian diet will highlight the results which=\r\n support veg food and vice versa. There are lot of  halfbaked researches. b=\r\nut if we think scientifically we will find that for different sources diffe=\r\nrent sources are better. For example calcium animal sources are best (Inclu=\r\nding milk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg sources are best, for pr=\r\noteins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also support this) So I think we c=\r\nan not say that only veg or non veg will suffice the diet. Obviously humans=\r\n can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is concerned I agree wi=\r\nth the values given by Rajarshi ji.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Yes, I agree Non veg food increa=\r\nses tamas in mind. But so does the deep fried vegetarian food, although les=\r\ns but in daily habit it will not let you escape from Tamas. I agree with Na=\r\nrasimha Ji that if more energy is used in digesting food, less energy is av=\r\nailable for brain. it is a scietific fact that after food, significant bloo=\r\nd supply is directed to intestines. How much Rajas Spicy food, tea, coffee,=\r\n coke and Red bull is increasing in us? We are what we eat! This is true. S=\r\no one should eat what one want to become.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; But still at last, I want =\r\nto mention that I am not advocating Non-veg food. I am just highlighting th=\r\ne facts. I am a strict vegetarian too. We should understand that we may be =\r\nright but we should realise that it does not necessarily mean other person =\r\nis not right.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Please point out my mistakes I had made in this post. =\r\nI agree that some values i mentioned here may not be exactly as quoted by s=\r\nources. But they are approximate and not too much off the line.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Kind=\r\n Regards\n\n&gt; Atul\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; I disgree with two points you mentioned.

(I =\r\nam only dealing with \n\n&gt; &gt; the science part of these discussions, as I had =\r\nalready maintained right at the \n\n&gt; &gt; beginning).\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; (3=\r\n) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) seve=\r\nral \n\n&gt; &gt; months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of=\r\n gorillas was \n\n&gt; &gt; fed with meat.

I am \n\n&gt; &gt; open to learning and reviewing my position, provide=\r\nd there is genuine evidence.\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; Their theory was that d=\r\nigestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with \n\n&gt; &gt; nuts and fru=\r\nits may have diverted more energy towards the development of brain. \n\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhough they were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not,=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0=C3=82=C2=A0a \n\n&gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximi=\r\nze one&#39;s intellectual development.\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; This is a wrong t=\r\nheory as far as human nutrition=C3=82=C2=A0is concerned, because human \n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; stomach structure (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain animal p=\r\nroducts \n\n&gt; &gt; far easier to digest than most planet based products. In my o=\r\nther mail, I have \n\n&gt; &gt; qoted from a couple of research papers and books on=\r\n clinical nutrition and \n\n&gt; &gt; dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more=\r\n; which may=C3=82=C2=A0take a few days since I \n\n&gt; &gt; have to get them from =\r\npeople who deal with these topics professionally, but time \n\n&gt; &gt; is not a p=\r\nroblem.=C3=82=C2=A0All the papers are=C3=82=C2=A0from the most accepted and=\r\n reputed \n\n&gt; &gt; scientific=C3=82=C2=A0journals.

Otherwise, feed the poor \n\n&gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she=\r\n needs.\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; An animal has a specific physical=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0structure and needs to maintain the same. But \n\n&gt; &gt; if trained they can =\r\n&#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of meals. I have seen people feeding \n\n&gt; &gt; vegeterian =\r\ndiets to dogs. Statistically speaking, an animal whose whole body \n\n&gt; &gt; str=\r\nucture is designed to be a carnivore, may adjust to any food for the sake o=\r\nf \n\n&gt; &gt; survival, but will become internally weak and susceptable to diseas=\r\ne and \n\n&gt; &gt; weaknesses. Who takes the karma for the disease and weakness th=\r\nat may result \n\n&gt; &gt; from an unnatural diet to an animal? \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; Not that all dogs who are feed a veg diet end up being diseased=\r\n, but the chances \n\n&gt; &gt; increase a lot. It is like not all smokers die of c=\r\nancer, but smoking makes one \n\n&gt; &gt; susceptible to cancer. It increases the =\r\nprobability. Therefore my personal \n\n&gt; &gt; opinion is that an animal if kept =\r\nat home, it should taken care of in the best \n\n&gt; &gt; way possible, providing =\r\nit with whatever maybe needed, including the right diet.\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; _______________\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; A question for you.\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; Scientists studying evoluti=\r\non and human body structures have concluded that meat \n\n&gt; &gt; eating along wi=\r\nth cropping and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4 \n\n&gt; &gt; million ye=\r\nars. That, without a diet which was omnivorous, the structure of the \n\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhuman stomach (lack of a developed=C3=82=C2=A0caecum),=C3=82=C2=A0and the t=\r\nhreefold increase in=C3=82=C2=A0brain \n\n&gt; &gt; size (from archeological eviden=\r\nces)=C3=82=C2=A0could never have been what it is today. \n\n&gt; &gt; Which means, =\r\nan omnivorous diet has been a=C3=82=C2=A0natural process, so ingrained that=\r\n it \n\n&gt; &gt; has changed the very structure of the human body. This cannot be =\r\ndone \n\n&gt; &gt; consciously, but only by the work of natural forces. (Again, if =\r\nyou want, I will \n\n&gt; &gt; provide relevent research=C3=82=C2=A0papers to prove=\r\n my claim).\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; What is your take on this? \n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Betw=\r\neen me and You, there is only me. \n\n&gt; &gt; Take away the me, so only You remai=\r\nn&quot; - Hallaj\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Sent: Thu, 2 December, 2010 12:48:03 AM\n\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Foo=\r\nd we eat\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; There ha=\r\ns been a lot of discussion on food. A few quick comments.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; (1) We=\r\n are we we eat. Production of various chemicals in our body and their \n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profo=\r\nund \n\n&gt; &gt; impact on us.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; (2) Much has been written on the materia=\r\nl benefits from vegetarianism. But that \n\n&gt; &gt; is not all. There are spiritu=\r\nal and subtle reasons as well.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Eating the flesh or body parts of=\r\n an animal that strongly identifies with the \n\n&gt; &gt; physical body entails a =\r\nkarma. Self-identification of plants with their physical \n\n&gt; &gt; body is much=\r\n subtler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much \n\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nmaller.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Especially these days, very cruel methods are used for m=\r\neat production by \n\n&gt; &gt; corporations and animals are treated very cruelly. =\r\nPart of the karma for their \n\n&gt; &gt; suffering goes to the ones benefiting fro=\r\nm their meat.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (=\r\nNational Public Radio) several \n\n&gt; &gt; months back.

Gorillas fed with \n\n&gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more e=\r\nnergy towards the development of brain. \n\n&gt; &gt; Though they were not sure if =\r\nthe same thing applies to human beings or not, a \n\n&gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian =\r\ndiet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; (4) Af=\r\nter we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well \n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; on work that requires alertness and skill. That is because the digesti=\r\nve process \n\n&gt; &gt; is using up a lot of energy (also known as agni or fire) a=\r\nnd there isn&#39;t much \n\n&gt; &gt; agni available for other activities such as diges=\r\ntion of intellectual ideas that \n\n&gt; &gt; happens in the mind. Similarly, diges=\r\ntion of spiritual ideas/experiences also \n\n&gt; &gt; requires agni and that canno=\r\nt happen well. That is why meditation or homam after \n\n&gt; &gt; a heavy meal are=\r\n fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before \n\n&gt; &gt; eating.\n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; (5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meats, d=\r\neep fried food \n\n&gt; &gt; with more oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive ag=\r\nni etc) are consumed more \n\n&gt; &gt; frequently, agni is diverted towards digest=\r\nion more often and there is less agni \n\n&gt; &gt; available for assimilaring inte=\r\nllectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. If \n\n&gt; &gt; one eats saattwik fo=\r\nod that is very easy to digest (simple grains, simple \n\n&gt; &gt; lentils and sim=\r\nple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spices, and fruits), \n\n&gt; &gt; less=\r\n agni is diverted towards digestion and more agni is available for \n\n&gt; &gt; as=\r\nsimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; (6)=\r\n Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass m=\r\nay \n\n&gt; &gt; be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, little bit of internal fire=\r\n may be enough \n\n&gt; &gt; to assimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a per=\r\nson with excellent \n\n&gt; &gt; vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot o=\r\nf internal fire may be needed \n\n&gt; &gt; in a person with poor vaasanas and many=\r\n obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all \n\n&gt; &gt; depends on vaasanas and impur=\r\nities in nadis and chakras.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; One person may eat meat and deep fri=\r\ned foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting \n\n&gt; &gt; them and yet make excellen=\r\nt spiritual progress. Another person may eat saattwik \n\n&gt; &gt; food, maximize =\r\nthe agni available for spiritual transformation and yet struggle \n\n&gt; &gt; to p=\r\nrogress spiritually. However, the best course of action for one is to ignor=\r\ne \n\n&gt; &gt; counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal,=\r\n that \n\n&gt; &gt; maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their =\r\nneeds. \n\n&gt; &gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, =\r\nfeed the poor \n\n&gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; (8) One should=\r\n eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough \n\n&gt; &gt; food t=\r\no sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material \n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n world using physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too much foo=\r\nd is \n\n&gt; &gt; not good for spiritual sadhana.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Instead of overeating=\r\n most of the time and fasting on specific days, it is \n\n&gt; &gt; better to eat l=\r\nimited amount always. Regular practices are more important for \n\n&gt; &gt; transf=\r\normation and success, than occasional practices.\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; (9) By merely t=\r\nhinking that god is the doer of all actions or considering food \n\n&gt; &gt; to be=\r\n god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how \n\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; deeply ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one inte=\r\nrnally \n\n&gt; &gt; feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is =\r\ndoing (e.g. \n\n&gt; &gt; eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons=\r\n, Jyotish Writings,\n\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam an=\r\nd Pitri Tarpana:\n\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a=\r\n difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/JyotishWritings\n\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-914169183-1291275431=:26863\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Excellent thoughts, Sir!

I am&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;jus=\r\nt highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetarian too. We &gt;should under=\r\nstand that we may be right but we should realize that &gt;it does not &gt;n=\r\necessarily mean other person is not right.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMy views are there on t=\r\nhis subject in archives. I wanted to stay away but still inspired to write =\r\nat least one message on the same.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n1) Using Arguments based on scie=\r\nnce, BV, so many of researches and plenty of informations available on the =\r\nInternet, One will never be able to come to a definitive conclusions.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n2) I never argue with people (even when I was aggressive and passionate=\r\n about the Idea of vegetarian food) with the above basis.&lt;br&gt;\nWhatever said=\r\n and done, people will continue eating meat, eggs, Fish, Other seafood and =\r\nprobably Human flash as well. I have, with experience, understood that ther=\r\ne is no point in arguing with people giving various Data. Each side will ha=\r\nve their own arguments, own sets of Data and own Counter Ideas to prove the=\r\nir point.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n3) Instead I appeal their conscious! I tell people aroun=\r\nd me, whenever the Topic comes up, only one simple thing - &quot;I dont want to =\r\nkill for filling up my Stomach&quot; and I say it from my heart. I tell people t=\r\nhat Put a knife edge on your own Throat or Cut a finger only a little, feel=\r\n the pain and now realize the Plight of a butchered Chicken or a Goat or a =\r\ncow or a buffalo or a...., Suffocate yourself by closing Nose &amp; Mouth a=\r\nnd see after only a few seconds, how you pent for the Air and Now realize t=\r\nhe &quot;Chhatpataahat&quot; of a fish forced out of water.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAnd all these, b=\r\necause one wish to fill the stomach or satisfy cravings of a habitual palat=\r\ne or both. Even vegetarians have their cravings of spice and other food stu=\r\nff but the very vital difference is that such craving does not need killing=\r\n!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n4) Just to give a result, One of colleagues, who is a Srilankan,=\r\n has left eating meat since 6 Months now and surely, one of the reasons for=\r\n his leaving meat is because I told my views him a few times when such disc=\r\nussions came up and I even told him that you are a Buddhist, the religion o=\r\nf Non-Injury and see what has happened to that very Idea. Hats-off to him f=\r\nor he really seems to have thought about it and dared to change his swabhav=\r\na which is so very difficult.&lt;br&gt;\nJust to clarify, I do not hesitate to exp=\r\nress my views even to Muslims and others and at least, this idea is appreci=\r\nated by them even if grudgingly. The Hard core meat eaters are also taken a=\r\n back with this idea. All though they know from their hearts of hearts, it =\r\ncomes as a shock even to them when somebody boldly brings that up. Most of =\r\nus are like a cat that drinks the milk with closed eyes. The Idea would hav=\r\ne gone in their mind and that is enough. One day probably it will germinate=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n5) Finally, The point is not to say that this side is good and t=\r\nhat side is bad. It&#39;ll be a foolish and unpalatable conclusion. It is to ju=\r\nst appeal the inside human of each individual, It is to appeal the rational=\r\n Intelligence of an Individual, It is to appeal the heart of a person and i=\r\nf that is not suffice to our ultra-hardened heart then a final reminder of =\r\n&quot;Law of Cause and effect -The Law of Karma&quot; at least to those of us who bel=\r\nieve in Natures unfailing governance. And that is the final Idea.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nBest Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nUtpal&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D=\r\n&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compo=\r\nse?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;=\r\nDr. A.

Please point out my mistakes I will make in this process.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; We are trying to discuss three points here&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 1)=\r\n Choosing a dietary habit&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on Non=\r\n-veg sources of nutrition&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 3) bioavailability or BV of Non veg vs V=\r\neg food.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I commented on two points &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 1=\r\n) Choosing a dietary habit &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on n=\r\non veg sources of nutrition&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 1) Choosing a Dietary habit&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One should choose his dietary habit based on his varna (=\r\naptitude and attitude) and goal in his life. He should not bother what the =\r\nBV or other factor or research says. For an athlete, Eggs are important par=\r\nt of his training. and for a person seeking spirituality one should stick t=\r\no vegetarian food unless he is able to rise above the difference in veg and=\r\n nonveg. I agree with Narasimha Ji about this point.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In =\r\nsome diseases Non veg sources play an very important role (Although not a n=\r\necessasity) like in Albumin deficiency two eggs per day can save a person f=\r\nrom costly (3000Rs per Inj) Albumin Injections. In TB, Soup made of goat me=\r\nat do wonders. Ayurveda also recommend it strongly Charak Samhita) etc.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on non veg sources of nut=\r\nrition&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I agree with the link provided in this discussion=\r\ns. Books and articles by Peta members are far more convincing for switching=\r\n to Veg sources. I can also provide tens of links and book reference which =\r\noppose their view. Honestly, I do not believe each and every information on=\r\n net and not every book written about nutirtion, just like astrology. Let u=\r\ns leave this debate aside and look at other aspect of it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; By &#39;Practically impossible&#39; I meant the cost factor and demand/supply fac=\r\ntor. In India (Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45%=\r\n people are Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied by=\r\n Non veg sources. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (=\r\nincluding gram soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nut=\r\ns (include almonds cashew etc - Costs needn&#39;t mention), Dairy products (Mil=\r\nk being 30-40 Rs per Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very complete =\r\nsource), &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In last two years, their demand rose by 15-20 =\r\n% but their price rose by 40-60%. even at current price, 60 % of population=\r\n can not afford a complete balanced diet as recommended by Experts which in=\r\nclude 250 Ml of milk, 50-70 gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms o=\r\nf fruits per person, along with grains and roughage etc (These are approx m=\r\ninimum quantities. Different sources may quote different quantities). There=\r\n is average family size of 5 and average family income is 200 Rs per day! A=\r\nnd nutrition is not the only thing needed in our life!!! Lot of other expen=\r\nditures are there&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Even at current prices, 60% population=\r\n can not afford balanced diet. If additional 40% is included in demand of v=\r\neg sources, price may rise another 100% and I need not to explain what will=\r\n happen at that time.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sir, I am not advocating Non-veg f=\r\nood here. I am also a strict vegetarian, even for milk I prefer a source wh=\r\nere there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can not expect no cruelity even for =\r\nmilk if you buy it from market and do not produce it yourself)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, I think and believe that practically it is impossible to shif=\r\nt all the population to veg sources especially when the agriculture land is=\r\n decreasing day by day because of many reasons)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 3) Bioav=\r\nailability or BV of different sources&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; It is always a que=\r\nstionable point. because again sections supporting vegetarian diet will hig=\r\nhlight the results which support veg food and vice versa. There are lot of =\r\n halfbaked researches. but if we think scientifically we will find that for=\r\n different sources different sources are better. For example calcium animal=\r\n sources are best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg =\r\nsources are best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ayurveda also suppo=\r\nrt this) So I think we can not say that only veg or non veg will suffice th=\r\ne diet. Obviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food alone. As far as BV=\r\n is concerned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; Yes, I agree Non veg food increases tamas in mind. But so does the deep=\r\n fried vegetarian food, although less but in daily habit it will not let yo=\r\nu escape from Tamas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy is used =\r\nin digesting food, less energy is available for brain. it is a scietific fa=\r\nct that after food, significant blood supply is directed to intestines. How=\r\n much Rajas Spicy food, tea, coffee, coke and Red bull is increasing in us?=\r\n We are what we eat! This is true. So one should eat what one want to becom=\r\ne.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; But still at last, I want to mention that I am not ad=\r\nvocating Non-veg food. I am just highlighting the facts. I am a strict vege=\r\ntarian too. We should understand that we may be right but we should realise=\r\n that it does not necessarily mean other person is not right.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Please point out my mistakes I had made in this post. I agree that so=\r\nme values i mentioned here may not be exactly as quoted by sources. But the=\r\ny are approximate and not too much off the line.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Kind Re=\r\ngards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Atul&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; --- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; =\r\nwrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I disgree with two points you mentioned. Let me clarify=\r\n. (I am only dealing with &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the science part of these discussi=\r\nons, as I had already maintained right at the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; beginning).&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scie=\r\nntist on NPR (National Public Radio) several &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; months back. Th=\r\ney conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After sever=\r\nal &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of th=\r\ne two sets. The ones &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; fed with meat were duller.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If=C3=82&nbsp;you have any references for this, in terms o=\r\nf whether they published any &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; paper on the same, I am interes=\r\nted to know and analyse that in details. I am &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; open to learni=\r\nng and reviewing my position, provided there is genuine evidence.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Their theory was that digestion of meat tak=\r\nes up more energy. Gorillas fed with &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may hav=\r\ne diverted more energy towards the development of brain. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Tho=\r\nugh they were not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not,=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;=C3=82&nbsp;a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can =\r\nmaximize one&#39;s intellectual development.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; This is a wrong theory as far as human nutrition=C3=82&nbsp;is conce=\r\nrned, because human &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; stomach structure (gut morphology) is su=\r\nch that it finds certain animal products &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; far easier to diges=\r\nt than most planet based products. In my other mail, I have &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nqoted from a couple of research papers and books on clinical nutrition and =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more; which may=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;take a few days since I &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; have to get them from peopl=\r\ne who deal with these topics professionally, but time &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is not=\r\n a problem.=C3=82&nbsp;All the papers are=C3=82&nbsp;from the most accepted=\r\n and reputed &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; scientific=C3=82&nbsp;journals. There is no con=\r\nfusion. Which is why I said, it is myth &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that=C3=82&nbsp;vege=\r\nterian=C3=82&nbsp;foods are=C3=82&nbsp;easier to digest, if digestibility i=\r\ns the criteria. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fu=\r\nrther, in my experience, I never found traditional vegeterians to be any mo=\r\nre &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; dull or smarter than traditional omnivores. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question:=\r\n Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If an anim=\r\nal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; An animal has a specific physical=C3=82&nbsp;structure and needs to maint=\r\nain the same. But &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind o=\r\nf meals. I have seen people feeding &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; vegeterian diets to dogs=\r\n. Statistically speaking, an animal whose whole body &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; structu=\r\nre is designed to be a carnivore, may adjust to any food for the sake of &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; survival, but will become internally weak and susceptable to d=\r\nisease and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; weaknesses. Who takes the karma for the disease a=\r\nnd weakness that may result &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; from an unnatural diet to an ani=\r\nmal? &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Not that all =\r\ndogs who are feed a veg diet end up being diseased, but the chances &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; increase a lot. It is like not all smokers die of cancer, but smoki=\r\nng makes one &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; susceptible to cancer. It increases the probabi=\r\nlity. Therefore my personal &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; opinion is that an animal if kep=\r\nt at home, it should taken care of in the best &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; way possible,=\r\n providing it with whatever maybe needed, including the right diet.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ______________=\r\n_&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; A que=\r\nstion for you.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Scientists studying=\r\n evolution and human body structures have concluded that meat &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; eating along with cropping and fruits has been prevelant since at least 4=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; million years. That, without a diet which was omnivorous, t=\r\nhe structure of the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; human stomach (lack of a developed=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;caecum),=C3=82&nbsp;and the threefold increase in=C3=82&nbsp;brain &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; size (from archeological evidences)=C3=82&nbsp;could never hav=\r\ne been what it is today. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Which means, an omnivorous diet has=\r\n been a=C3=82&nbsp;natural process, so ingrained that it &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; has=\r\n changed the very structure of the human body. This cannot be done &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; consciously, but only by the work of natural forces.

A few quick comments.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (1) W=\r\ne are we we eat. Production of various chemicals in our body and their &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; interactions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat h=\r\nas a profound &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; impact on us.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (2)=\r\n Much has been written on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But tha=\r\nt &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is not all. There are spiritual and subtle reasons as well=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Eating the flesh or body parts of an animal =\r\nthat strongly identifies with the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; physical body entails a ka=\r\nrma. Self-identification of plants with their physical &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; body =\r\nis much subtler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; smaller.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Especially these days,=\r\n very cruel methods are used for meat production by &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; corporat=\r\nions and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma for their &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (Natio=\r\nnal Public Radio) several &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; months back. They conducted an exp=\r\neriment on gorillas. One set of gorillas was &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; fed with meat. =\r\nThe other set was fed with nuts, fruits etc. After several &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; m=\r\nonths, researchers found a gap in the intelligence of the two sets. The one=\r\ns &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; fed with meat were duller.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Th=\r\neir theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed wi=\r\nth &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the=\r\n development of brain. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Though they were not sure if the same=\r\n thing applies to human beings or not, a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian=\r\n diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intellectual development.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or sleepy and =\r\ncannot focus well &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; on work that requires alertness and skill.=\r\n That is because the digestive process &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is using up a lot of =\r\nenergy (also known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; agn=\r\ni available for other activities such as digestion of intellectual ideas th=\r\nat &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; happens in the mind. Similarly, digestion of spiritual id=\r\neas/experiences also &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; requires agni and that cannot happen we=\r\nll. That is why meditation or homam after &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a heavy meal are f=\r\nruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ea=\r\nting.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (5) If foods that light up a higher dige=\r\nstive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; with more oil, spicy=\r\n foods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nfrequently, agni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less=\r\n agni &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; available for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual =\r\nideas and experiences. If &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; one eats saattwik food that is ver=\r\ny easy to digest (simple grains, simple &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; lentils and simple v=\r\negetables, all softly cooked with mild spices, and fruits), &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nless agni is diverted towards digestion and more agni is available for &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well.=\r\n But huge stacks of dry grass may &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; be burnt by just one spark=\r\n! Similarly, little bit of internal fire may be enough &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to as=\r\nsimilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; vaasanas and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire m=\r\nay be needed &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstruc=\r\ntions (wet grass). Thus, it all &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; depends on vaasanas and impu=\r\nrities in nadis and chakras.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; One person may ea=\r\nt meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat sa=\r\nattwik &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; food, maximize the agni available for spiritual trans=\r\nformation and yet struggle &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to progress spiritually. However,=\r\n the best course of action for one is to ignore &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; counter-exam=\r\nples and be a vegetarian. All other things being equal, that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and=\r\n their needs. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, g=\r\nood. Otherwise, feed the poor &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (8) One should eat to live and not live to eat=\r\n. A yogi should consume enough &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; food to sustain oneself so th=\r\nat one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; world using p=\r\nhysical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; not good for spiritual sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Instead =\r\nof overeating most of the time and fasting on specific days, it is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; better to eat limited amount always. Regular practices are more impo=\r\nrtant for &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; transformation and success, than occasional practi=\r\nces.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; (9) By merely thinking that god is the do=\r\ner of all actions or considering food &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to be god&#39;s prasad, on=\r\ne cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; deeply=\r\n ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one internally &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is=\r\n doing (e.g. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one i=\r\ns free.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tar=\r\npana:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Fil=\r\nms that make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spiri=\r\ntuality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group=\r\n/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n=\r\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n--0-914169183-1291275431=:26863--\r\n\n"}}
