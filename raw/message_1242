Rao&quot; \n&lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; \n&gt; Mah=\r\narshi Parasara, father of Maharshi Vyasa, wrote a treatise on \nJyotisha \n&gt; =\r\nshastra just before Kali yuga started. He referred in it a few \ntimes to th=\r\ne \n&gt; &quot;intellectual pygmies of Kali yuga&quot; and gave techniques suitable \nfor =\r\n\n&gt; astrologers of Kali yuga. Thus, he was conscious of impending Kali \nyuga=\r\n and \n&gt; that was on his in mind as he taught. In the chapters on remedial \n=\r\nmeasures \n&gt; to overcome karmic problems (as represented by planets and \nhor=\r\noscope), he \n&gt; basically referred to various kinds of homas. Though some pe=\r\nople \nmay insist \n&gt; on japam (meditation) today, Parasara only referred to =\r\noffering \nmantras in \n&gt; homam fire. He was not specific on poorvaangam (ini=\r\ntial offerings) \nand \n&gt; uttaraangam (final offerings) to be used and asked =\r\nto use whatever \n&gt; agnimukham (fire ritual procedure) is practiced in the f=\r\namily or \nby one&#39;s \n&gt; gurus. But he was specific on the mantras to be offer=\r\ned in fire \nfor various \n&gt; deities.\n&gt; \n&gt; Obviously, Parasara did not advise=\r\n japam (meditation) of various \nmantras and \n&gt; instead advised homam (fire =\r\nritual) with various mantras, for a \nreason. He \n&gt; knew that the latter is =\r\n*far more effective* in Kali yuga.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; The goal o=\r\nf sadhana is to burn impurities in the subtle body \n(synonymous to \n&gt; overc=\r\noming various internal enemies and weaknesses) so that energy \ncan flow \n&gt; =\r\nfreely within one&#39;s subtle body. The internal fire (bhootaagni) \nburning \n&gt;=\r\n within us does this burning. When you focus your mind on a mantra, \n&gt; bhoo=\r\ntaagni burns and starts acting.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, the ability of *most* people =\r\nto focus the mind is highly \nlimited. \n&gt; The bhootaagni is extremely low in=\r\n most people. Thus, meditation \nof mantras \n&gt; even in counts of millions do=\r\nes not make much difference really. \nThere is an \n&gt; impact only if one spen=\r\nds 4-5 hours meditating on the mantra \neveryday. The \n&gt; first hour or so is=\r\n warm up, mind slowly achieves a decent focus \nafter that \n&gt; and the fire s=\r\ntarts to burn slowly.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you do the same meditation in front of an ext=\r\nernal fire, it \nmakes a big \n&gt; difference. You tend to absorb some qualitie=\r\ns from the people you \nspend time \n&gt; with. When you spend a lot of time wit=\r\nh a cinema fan, the cinema \nfan inside \n&gt; you becomes strong. When you spen=\r\nd a lot of time with a politics \nobserver, \n&gt; the politics observer inside =\r\nyou becomes strong. Similarly, when \nyou spend a \n&gt; lot of time with fire, =\r\nthe fire inside you becomes strong.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you do a 30-min homam and spend=\r\n just 10 minutes meditating by \nthe fire \n&gt; after homam, the energy surroun=\r\nding you, the level of focus you \ncan get and \n&gt; the amount of impurities y=\r\nou can burn are much more than a regular \n&gt; meditation for a couple of hour=\r\ns!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; One need not believe me. The proof of the =\r\npudding is in eating it. \nIf \n&gt; anybody tries to do a 30-minute homam every=\r\nday (or atleast every \nweekend) \n&gt; for a few months, one should find some d=\r\nifference internally.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mahaganapathi homam is very apt for many people.=\r\n Lord Ganapathi \ntakes care \n&gt; of one&#39;s material needs and gives spiritual =\r\nprogress at the same \ntime. A \n&gt; detailed manual, an audio MP3 file and a c=\r\nomplete youtube video of \na simple \n&gt; 20-min Mahaganapathi homam are availa=\r\nble for free, so that people \ncan learn \n&gt; and get started (see the link be=\r\nlow).\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; It is not without a reason that many sa=\r\ndhus (saints) maintain a \ndhuni \n&gt; (constant fire) near them. When at Daksh=\r\nineshwar, Swami \nVivekananda used to \n&gt; light a big fire in open space that=\r\n would burn throughout the \nnight and he \n&gt; used to meditate by it whole ni=\r\nght.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one can actually spend a couple of hours meditating by the sid=\r\ne \nof a \n&gt; bright fire everyday, I am sure they can make a lot of quick \npr=\r\nogress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free J=\r\nyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath C=\r\nentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------ \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ---=\r\n-- \n&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, February 19, 2009 11:52 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisd=\r\nom] Homa & Meditation !!!\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Garu!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I read somewhere =\r\nthat you are of the opinion that 20/30 minutes \nHoma\n&gt; &gt; is equivalent to 4=\r\n/5 hours of Meditation. I didn&#39;t understand it.\n&gt; &gt; some 3 or 4 days back, =\r\ni suddenly realise, while in the midst of\n&gt; &gt; homa activities that i&#39;ve alw=\r\nays forgotten about the surroundings\n&gt; &gt; whenever i sit for homa. (from pre=\r\nparation to conclusion). this i\n&gt; &gt; realised suddenly. for example - After =\r\ntaking bath, i empty all\n&gt; &gt; ashes of previous day in a bag, wash & clean h=\r\noma-kund with \nliquid\n&gt; &gt; detergent, wash other utensils, and other such re=\r\nquired \npreparation,\n&gt; &gt; start the actual procedure and conclude. during al=\r\nl theses\n&gt; &gt; activities, the surroundings are almost forgotten (i also make=\r\n \nsure\n&gt; &gt; that i switch on the silent mode in cell phone).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; no w i =\r\nam getting some glimpses of what you meant but still wish \nto\n&gt; &gt; understan=\r\nd more on that from you. take your time as i know that \nyou\n&gt; &gt; have your h=\r\nands-full.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; warm regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
