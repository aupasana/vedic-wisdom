My only point in\n&gt; Vegterianism is related to Compession=\r\n against cruelty. Dharma (Non Violence)\n&gt; against Adharama (Killing Innocen=\r\nt creatures).\n&gt; ***\n&gt; Anyway, my point is, I understand that it is good to =\r\neat totally vegetarian food when you engage in sadhana, specially things li=\r\nke havans, or else it conflicts with your system badly.\n&gt; In my opinion, Sa=\r\nadhana or No Saadhana, if something is not correct will remain Incorrect. k=\r\nilling for filling stomach is if Not right then for me it&#39;ll remain *Not ri=\r\nght in all conditions*. it is a different matter, if in future i succumb to=\r\n challanging conditions and start eating meat but even then it&#39;ll not justi=\r\nfy and make it proper thing.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; Dear Rajarshi, Now i hope you don&#39;t ge=\r\nt offended by my message. i apologise in advance for my bluntness.\n&gt;  your =\r\nsecond Para and some writings in your earlier message gives me impression t=\r\nhat you are heavily philosophising. Karama, Desh/kaal etc... does not appea=\r\nl me. to be very honest. \n&gt; In my opinon, if one can justify eating popular=\r\n meat of chicken, etc.. then anything under the Sun is eatable.  with that =\r\nlogic, those people who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, insects, cocroaches are=\r\n perfectly alright. even people who have started eating human flesh are als=\r\no acceptable and not doing anything wrong as per the &#39;their&#39; thinking.\n&gt; To=\r\n talk about Karma, Conditioning, Culture etc..., and try to make quality ju=\r\ndgements by the logic of &#39;Direct killing&#39; and &#39;eating meat of already dead&#39;=\r\n does not go well with me. it is just a philosophy to cover up.\n&gt; Poeple bo=\r\nrn in Those cultures have become Vegetarian becuase they hate killing invlo=\r\nved. I gave an example of one such person and there are few more i know. ho=\r\nwvever they are very very very rare.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; The above arguments are incorr=\r\nect. I know some non-vegetarian people who provide such arguements,  but th=\r\nese arguments are nonsensical and childish. Almost Zakir Naik style of argu=\r\nments.\n&gt;  I agree completely. it is childish, Laughable and cruel jokes. Th=\r\nats how i also take it when such people talk such nonsense.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; Lastly,=\r\n i&#39;ll add a philospohical thought. If so much of killing every hourly basis=\r\n, mostly for the sole purpose of *Craving* goes on in the world, and the pr=\r\nime mover is Human society, then how we hope to have a peacefull world with=\r\nout blood shed and massacare. unfailing law of Karma (Cause & effect) will =\r\nfind many ways to give it back to (in)Human societies.\n&gt; Om Shaanti Shaanti=\r\n Shaanti:\n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; Utpal \n&gt;  \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoog=\r\nroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ..&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; I hope you or others won&#39;t get offended by my mails. Please tak=\r\ne them in the right vein. I am merely discussing. Now some points:\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; But I have often feel that they are themselves are not=\r\n convinced when they argue. they are &#39;hollow&#39; arguments. However , I&#39;ll hon=\r\nestly say that i have no answers for &#39;life in a Plant&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When I use=\r\nd to eat non-vegetarian food many of my friends who were=C3=82 vegetarian p=\r\neople would give me a similar logic, as you mentioned in your first writing=\r\n. My point is, as a non-vegetarian I am not claiming that I have any specia=\r\nl sensitivity to plants, over animals. No. All I am saying is that,=C3=82  =\r\nthis logic that many vegetarian people provide to convince average non-veg =\r\npeople to quit eating non-veg, does not hold good.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; I person=\r\nally can not look at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its path=\r\netic site. People in their excitements stand in queue to see the cutting of=\r\n throat of a chicken and then take away that as parcel. The flash of so cru=\r\nelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the human=\r\ns that they just overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which comes=\r\n out of water is such a disturbing site. Panting for water (i don&#39;t have pr=\r\noper English word to describe the condition of a fish out of water). and th=\r\nen the dead fish thus is so tasty.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; I understand=\r\n and appreciate you feelings, but I personally do not share them. Call me c=\r\nruel hearted. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; When the question of sensitivity comes in, t=\r\nhere is no universal standard for such. It is moslty a case of conditioning=\r\n. What one feels disgusted or pained about may not affect another. Same rul=\r\ne cannot be used to judge everyone.=C3=82  \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; Some of my non-=\r\nvegetarian friends were watching discovery channel where they showed that p=\r\neople in some parts of the world eat insects. My friends seemed disgusted. =\r\nI asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you can eat a chicken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=\r\n=82 if someone eats an insect. Just because one is born in a certain area i=\r\nn a certain culture in a certain set of value, one gets the believe that wh=\r\nat one is not accustomed to must be incorrect. I told them if in a future l=\r\nife time they were to be born in that place, they would gladly keep eating =\r\ninsects without the slightest doubt in their mind. We humans are incorrigib=\r\nle product of our own conditions which in my opinion is all right. BUT the =\r\nproblem happens when we think our conditions are the only possible conditio=\r\nning in the world, and therefore we wonder why don&#39;t others share similar i=\r\ndeas. That is incorrect. Nature has created the world diverse, and so it is=\r\n. Everything is desh-kaal-patra. A person who is a\n&gt; &gt; vegetarian in this l=\r\nife, if he gets born in a place/culture/ family in a later lifetime which=\r\n=C3=82 eats non-vegetarian food, he would not even bat an eye lid while eat=\r\ning the same. I know=C3=82 people who faint at the sight of blood, but ther=\r\ne are doctors who do multiple operations daily. So my point is, personal se=\r\nnsitivity can be a very good reason for an individual, but it=C3=82 cannot =\r\nbe=C3=82 a universal logic applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; A far better =\r\nangle of tackling this is the idea of karma. Even then, if someone can make=\r\n sure he is not directly killing an animal, not selecting a live animal to =\r\nbe killed, but rather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be h=\r\nandled easily. Further, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=82 does not want t=\r\no deal in the raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The am=\r\nount of karma that you would get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be e=\r\nasily handled.=C3=82 It is similar to the one you would get for buying some=\r\n simple daal which has come to the market through the hands of a middle man=\r\n who has cheated the farmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repurc=\r\nussions in all food we eat in this age. It is unavoidable. There are some e=\r\nggs - broiler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be e=\r\naten because they never grow into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth. W=\r\nhat karma does one get for consuming that? God knows.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; An av=\r\nerage non-vegetarian, at least in India, to be precise is actually an omniv=\r\norous. His staple diet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc and 20 =\r\npercent non-veg. From a scientific point of view, this is a good combinatio=\r\nn. People who feed on more than 60 percent non-veg food in their staple die=\r\nt, are prone to serious heath issues at a younger age. But this 80-20 veg/n=\r\non-veg, is biologically good.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 If we don&#39;=\r\nt eat fish then sea will be full of fishes:), Earth will be full of chicken=\r\ns:0, Veg food will become unaffordable if everybody will become vegetarian =\r\n:Etc...are more often than not, put up such arguments to defend however as =\r\ni said earlier they are themselves not convinced.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The above a=\r\nrguments are incorrect.

If anyone finds it, le me know =\r\nso that 1 guy on this earth can become vegetarian.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He also quotes S=\r\nai Baba, Jesus and Mohammed Prophet adhering to non-veg.
