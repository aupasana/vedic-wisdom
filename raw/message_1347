Just as the gross\n&gt; matter consumed by us impacts our gross bodies, the subtle nature of the\n&gt; gross matter consumed by us impacts our subtle nature.\n&gt;\n&gt; If food is cooked by someone with negative thoughts, those thoughts do \n&gt; shape\n&gt; the subtle nature of that food and impact the subtle nature of the person\n&gt; eating the food!\n&gt;\n&gt; In this age, the food we eat, the water (or other drinks) we drink and \n&gt; even\n&gt; the air we breathe are corrupted at the gross level as well the subtle\n&gt; level. As Kali deepens (we are only 5,000 years into 432,000 years!), this\n&gt; will only get worse. These heavy impurities accumulating fast in one&#39;s\n&gt; subtle nature need heavy sadhanas to burn them and yet people have no time\n&gt; for spiritual sadhana.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even an idol will carry the subtle vibrations of the thoughts of people\n&gt; involved in its making - people who dug up the ore, purified it, made it,\n&gt; transported and sold it etc. People have a fascination for idols, yantras\n&gt; etc, but they are *relatively* ineffective in this age.\n&gt;\n&gt; The element of air, as you said, is badly corrupted and obtaining god\n&gt; through praanaayaama etc is quite difficult. If one were to follow the \n&gt; path\n&gt; of Raja yoga and obtain god through yogic practices of praanaayaama, \n&gt; mudras,\n&gt; bandhas etc, it is very very difficult in this age. When one eats pure \n&gt; food\n&gt; and breathes pure air, it is still a difficult thing. In this age, it is\n&gt; thousand fold difficult. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to say that Raja \n&gt; yoga\n&gt; is not for this age.\n&gt;\n&gt; The only elements that cannot be corrupted are space (the vacuum that is \n&gt; the\n&gt; basis for other elements and the underlying reality behind all realities)\n&gt; and fire. Obtaining god through the element of space is essentially the\n&gt; Vedantic path of contemplation. This is too abstract and difficult for \n&gt; most\n&gt; people (just as the element of space itself is!).\n&gt;\n&gt; The element left is fire. Fire is ever pure and purifies anything it comes\n&gt; in contact with. The first verse of Rigveda is a praise of Fire. Fore\n&gt; worship is an ancient practice found in many religions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Vijaya Kumara Lakshmi Narayana Rao Pingali&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom-owner@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, February 27, 2009 7:50 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: Pollution of panch bhutas\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt;\n&gt; I wanted to send this in reply, but did not want a controversy. If you\n&gt; feel the mail is fit for the forum, feel free to quote this and reply\n&gt; ;)\n&gt;\n&gt; The five elements are:\n&gt; earth\n&gt; ether or sky\n&gt; air\n&gt; fire\n&gt; water\n&gt;\n&gt; Sound is not one of five elements!\n&gt;\n&gt; I am not sure how sky is polluted. Yes, we are leaving quite a few debris \n&gt; in\n&gt; the space, but, not sure if it amounts to polluting.\n&gt; By definition sky is end less and a little bit of debris can not\n&gt; pollute sky!\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, frankly speaking, I do not understand what is pollution and what\n&gt; it has to do with spiritual progress. We are trying to imagine and\n&gt; feel god in some thing (like a murthy which representation of earth\n&gt; element.\n&gt;\n&gt; Feeling Sky is not easy, as sky is actually not physical but our\n&gt; perception. Invoking god and feeling god in no where is very very \n&gt; difficult.\n&gt;\n&gt; Idols are of earth element in nature. How does pollution of earth\n&gt; really hamper our sadhana? With an idol, it is easier to pray with\n&gt; eyes open. With eyes open, there is lesser chance loose our senses.\n&gt; How ever, keep looking at idol for some time and slowly close your\n&gt; eyes and keep visualising the idol and start doing the japam. You have\n&gt; a good chance of loosing sense of remaining world. How ever, it is not\n&gt; easy to forget about idol itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; I can understand the argument of pollution in case of air as benefit\n&gt; from pranayama and japam with respect. Air is polluted and pranayama\n&gt; is definitely affected.\n&gt;\n&gt; I do not understand how the water can be used for spiritual sadhana.\n&gt; Perhaps the tarpanas? I am not sure why polluted water hamper our\n&gt; sadhana.\n&gt;\n&gt; Even if fire ritual, we are asking the bad fire to be away\n&gt; (kravyaadamagnim prahinoemi duuram). So, even Fire is not pure.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am convinced fire ritual is perhaps more beneficial. How ever, I can\n&gt; not understand the logic of pollution (except for pranayama). To me,\n&gt; it sounds like a far fetched argument in favor of fire ritual.\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to rake up a small controversy here:\n&gt;\n&gt; In Mahabharata, there is a small story regarding Khandava Dahanam\n&gt; where the fire God comes seeking help from Krishna and Arjuna as he\n&gt; ate lot of ghee as people kept doing homams and hences need to eat\n&gt; khadava forest which is full of herbs. So, are we burdening the fire\n&gt; God? If the fire God is burdened is he pure any more?\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Vijay\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, manish gour &lt;manishgo_in@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hello All,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha ji often mentions that out of the 5 elements only Agni is\n&gt; unpolluted .\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Here is the explanation that I found on one of the web page at\n&gt; http://ignca..nic.in/ps_03015.htm\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hope this is useful to people in understanding why Homam is so\n&gt; important.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;       The question to be asked is what are the diverse components of\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;       disturbance, the ecological imbalances and what are the\n&gt; diverse components\n&gt;&gt;       of the disturbance, the ecological imbalances and what\n&gt; methodologies and\n&gt;&gt;       strategies were adopted in the past to sustain these balance.\n&gt; Can we, even\n&gt;&gt;       at this state, learn any lesson from the past for equipping\n&gt; ourselves to\n&gt;&gt;       face the human predicaments today?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;       Let us begin by enumerating the principal components of the\n&gt;&gt;       environment\n&gt;&gt;       most polluted, species most threatened and how each disturbs\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;       ecological balance. Thereafter, we can return to the worldview\n&gt; of the\n&gt;&gt;       historical past, the myth, ritual and art of this country or\n&gt; for that\n&gt;&gt;       matter, practically all cultures, pre-renaissance. The\n&gt; worldview is\n&gt;&gt;       mercifully sustained by so-called primitive societies, be it\n&gt; in India,\n&gt;&gt;       Africa, Australia or America. At the philosophic speculative\n&gt; level, the\n&gt;&gt;       living continuities can be seen only in India.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;       So today, this moment where four-fifths of humanity lives\n&gt; (i.e.,\n&gt;&gt;       India and Asia), what is threatened? What are we polluting,\n&gt; destroying,\n&gt;&gt;       thus bringing forebodings of the annihilation of Man on earth?\n&gt; What is the\n&gt;&gt;       quality of life we can hope for?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;       First and foremost it water, the basic sustaining principle -\n&gt; clean\n&gt;&gt;       water or to use a traditional phrase &#39;pure or unpolluted\n&gt; (�uddha)\n&gt;&gt;       water&#39; - is becoming scarce. Water systems are increasingly\n&gt; over-exploited\n&gt;&gt;       and polluted. Any India is familiar with the daily rituals\n&gt; which serve as\n&gt;&gt;       reminders of the concept of pure and, therefore, holy water.\n&gt; No daily,\n&gt;&gt;       monthly, annual ceremony is complete without ritual\n&gt; purification with\n&gt;&gt;       water. At birth, marriage, death, this concept is articulated\n&gt; and yet we\n&gt;&gt;       have polluted these waters of life\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;       Next, the pollution of the earth - Mother Earth, floating free\n&gt; ball\n&gt;&gt;       beneath the most gleaming membrane of bright blue sky. And\n&gt; what have we\n&gt;&gt;       done to it? Arid lands have increased, soil which was\n&gt; venerated has been\n&gt;&gt;       eroded and infertility, sand and salt have taken over. It is\n&gt; estimated\n&gt;&gt;       that in this part of the world, a million hectares are being\n&gt; desertified\n&gt;&gt;       each year. Desecration of the bowels of the earth through\n&gt; excessive\n&gt;&gt;       quarrying is common. Man&#39;s power has hollowed the still centre\n&gt; of life. P�thiv�,\n&gt;&gt;       the eternal mother, has been polluted and desecrated.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;       Related to the pollution of water and earth is the massive\n&gt;&gt;       unprecedented deforestation. The Indian sub-continent has been\n&gt;&gt;       progressively deforested: the soil&#39;s ability to absorb and\n&gt; hold water has\n&gt;&gt;       diminished. Severe floods have occurred more frequently and\n&gt; deforestation\n&gt;&gt;       has affected most adversely the eco-system of the Himalayas\n&gt; where our\n&gt;&gt;       major river systems - the Indus, the Ganges and the\n&gt; Brahmaputra -\n&gt;&gt;       originate. Each day we learn of the increase in wastelands and\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;       consequent effect upon rural life, be they the forests of\n&gt; Bastar or the\n&gt;&gt;       hills of the Himalayan range. In the language of Indian myth,\n&gt; this is the\n&gt;&gt;       rape of the tree and river goddess, the V�k�ik�s,\n&gt;&gt;       and the destruction of the gods of the woods, the Vanadevat�.\n&gt;&gt;       No wonder the Chipko Movement and Protect the Silent Valley is\n&gt; a cry of\n&gt;&gt;       anguish. Most of all, the present destruction is a dangerous\n&gt; play with the\n&gt;&gt;       mythical centre - Sumeru, the\n&gt;&gt;       world axis, the Himalayas.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;       The disturbance in water, earth, vegetation, river and\n&gt; mountain\n&gt;&gt;       ecology systems has naturally threatened all manner of life -\n&gt; aquatic,\n&gt;&gt;       terrestrial and celestial. Mythically, �e�an�ga\n&gt;&gt;       upholds the earth, the Ga�g� rides the crocodile, Yamun� the\n&gt; tortoise\n&gt;&gt;       and each is threatened. Boars and elephants upheld the earth;\n&gt; they too are\n&gt;&gt;       dying. So who upholds the earth now? The birds of heaven, the\n&gt; Swan, the\n&gt;&gt;       Garu�a and other who carried the gods are vanishing. So who\n&gt; sustains the\n&gt;&gt;       moral and cosmic order? There can only be chaos.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;       And worst of all, there is the pollution of the holy space -\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;       air, V�yu and the sky which\n&gt;&gt;       permeates and envelopes all life. The tragedy of Bhopal is too\n&gt; close for\n&gt;&gt;       comment, but equally demonic are the �suric chimneys of black\n&gt; t�masic\n&gt;&gt;       forces which pollute the &#39;lungs&#39; of life. Acid rains are\n&gt; common elsewhere\n&gt;&gt;       and man looks in vain for the purity of the water to flow from\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;       rain-filled clouds. Destruction is writ large on the balmy\n&gt; skies, once\n&gt;&gt;       azure blue, today smoke grey.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;       Finally, we have polluted holy sound, the primeval Nada,\n&gt; through\n&gt;&gt;       the chaos of our life. Noise pollution makes Man deaf to the\n&gt; inner voices\n&gt;&gt;       of his wisdom.And so Man aspires higher\n&gt;&gt;       and higher, beyond the pollution of his making, to that one\n&gt; source which\n&gt;&gt;       sustains all and is yet beyond his reach, namely, the Sun -\n&gt; �ditya - the\n&gt;&gt;       giver of light in the sky and fire on earth - Agni - the\n&gt; source of energy\n&gt;&gt;       which appears unpollutable unlike the fuel of his making. This\n&gt; energy,\n&gt;&gt;       physically and metaphysically, is Man&#39;s only ray of hope for\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt;       continuance of life.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Thank you,\n&gt;&gt; Manish\n\n\n"}}
