But now I perform the homam regula=\r\nrly exactly as descried in the manual by Mr PVR Narasimha Rao. \n\nMy homa ku=\r\nndam is around 8 inches (each side) and I use dried coconut pieces (flakes =\r\nabout an inch long are better, you can simply cut the dried coconut halves =\r\nwith a simple knife to get these flakes) as offering. For the first time I =\r\nhave used gomay with ghee on each piece. These also cause NO smoke, nor any=\r\n unpleasant odor after the ceremony).\n\nI control the fire with the amount o=\r\nf dried coconut and ghee I offer in the fire. When the fire is subsiding I =\r\nadd a little piece of camphor (karpuram), some dried coconut powder and a d=\r\nrop of ghee. Dropping the ghee directly on the flame seems to dampen it a l=\r\nittle. Adding a drop just to side of the fire seems to help spread it. Best=\r\n way is to try and learn. \n\nIn summary, it seems just fine to do the homam =\r\nin an apartment or other such closed spaces.\n\nI hope this helps. Do not wai=\r\nt, start doing it. \nBhavadiya\nR\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mur=\r\nalihomam&quot; &lt;muralihomam@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear All,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am new to this grou=\r\np and I would like to do Homam in my apartment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can you please help me=\r\n in understanding how to do homam in a apartment without fire alarm issue a=\r\nnd also the roof not getting black color bcoz of fire?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Mura=\r\nli\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
