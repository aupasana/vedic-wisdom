But it implies not being \na caught in them as a prisoner. One can love all (or a few) and derive \npleasure from one&#39;s actions and from the motivation of one&#39;s actions. But, \nwhen a bad result comes or someone cheats or someone leaves, a karma yogi \nmoves on and does not get stuck. He does not waste energy on things not in \nhis control. What I do right now is in my control and I focus my energy on \nit. What happened or what someone did to me is out of my control. Learn the \nlesson quickly and move on. Crying over spilled milk is useless. Past is \nspilled milk.\n\nMany people spend 95% of their mental energy thinking too much about things \nin past and future that are not in their control (why did he do this to me? \nWhy did this happen to me? He is so mean. Or, I hope so and so thing will \nhappen. Will it happen this way or not? etc). Nishkaama Karma yoga teaches \none to take mind off what one cannot control and focus on what is under \none&#39;s control. Your action at present is under your control.\n\nThe difference between sentient beings like us and robots is not emotions. \nOne can in future create a robot in which different pre-defined chemicals \nare produced in different pre-defined situations and different emotions are \nexperienced. That is not the big thing. The big difference between us and \nrobots is that we have something called &quot;free will&quot;. A robot has no free \nwill. There is a model to predict the possible actions of a robot in a given \nsituation. A robot is &quot;programmed&quot; to behave that way. Our free will can \nmake us break out of the &quot;program&quot; and become absolutely &quot;free&quot; oneday. In \nfact, the way I look at it, one who becomes happy in certain situations and \nsad in certain situations (like most people) IS the real robot. He is \nbehaving as &quot;programmed&quot;. He is not using the free will to break out of the \nprogram and become free.\n\nThe state of a liberated being cannot be imagined. But it is most certainly \nnot a dull or robotic state. It is a state of bliss that rishis obtained \nafter much self-effort and continuous exercise of free will.\n\nWhen one has sunk into the abyss of self-pity and hatred, exercising free \nwill to come out of the abyss and see light can be very very difficult, \nthough not impossible.\n\nMy best wishes to your friend!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;vishal_moon_123&quot; &lt;mbavishal@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, April 28, 2009 6:54 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Karma Works\n\n\n&gt; Namsate Narasimhaji\n&gt;\n&gt; One of my close friend is very upset from lat 7-8 years with the events \n&gt; happened in his life.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; First, answer to Rajarshi: If A gets an opportunity to pay back a bad \n&gt;&gt; thing\n&gt;&gt; to B but resists the temptation, then the payback is postponed. A will \n&gt;&gt; get a\n&gt;&gt; similar opportunity later (possibly in another life). At that time, he \n&gt;&gt; can\n&gt;&gt; either do the bad thing to B or resist the temptation again and postpone\n&gt;&gt; further. If A becomes a jeevanmukta by then, i.e. one who is liberated \n&gt;&gt; while\n&gt;&gt; living and engaging in actions without any sense of I-ness, then he can \n&gt;&gt; pay\n&gt;&gt; back the bad thing without incurring further karmas. If A got moksha and \n&gt;&gt; got\n&gt;&gt; out of the game, then A is fine but B still has that karma pending. \n&gt;&gt; Nature\n&gt;&gt; will find a stubstitute to pay back this karma to B. That person will get \n&gt;&gt; an\n&gt;&gt; opportunity to do the bad thing to B.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When I say paying back, please note that the action and reaction are not\n&gt;&gt; necessarily identical, but they are compatible.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Now, answer to Utpal: A is out of cycle as he accepted what happened and \n&gt;&gt; B\n&gt;&gt; has a bad karma. Either A or a substitute will get a chance to pay back \n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; bad karma to B later. If A succumbs to the temptation when he gets an\n&gt;&gt; opportunity later to pay back, he is back in the cycle.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You do something to someone. They pay you back. The cycle is done. If \n&gt;&gt; they\n&gt;&gt; identified with the action of payback, it becomes new karma for them. You\n&gt;&gt; will again get a chance to pay back them again. If you do (and identify \n&gt;&gt; with\n&gt;&gt; the action), you are back in the cycle. And so on.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is quite complex. But the key to getting out of the cycle is: \n&gt;&gt; accepting\n&gt;&gt; what happens to you, being good to others and overcoming ego and the \n&gt;&gt; sense\n&gt;&gt; of &quot;I am doing&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Karma is not just good and bad things we do to people. It is also the\n&gt;&gt; thoughts entertained by the mind. Suppose you see a nice car and think \n&gt;&gt; &quot;how\n&gt;&gt; I wish I had such a car&quot;. Any action or thought that has some force \n&gt;&gt; behind\n&gt;&gt; it becomes a karma and gets a reaction from Nature. When your punya \n&gt;&gt; balance\n&gt;&gt; is sufficient in a future life, Nature will give you such a car, whether \n&gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt; not you want it in that life! You may not know why you got it, but you \n&gt;&gt; got\n&gt;&gt; it because you asked for it earlier.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Nature is like a bank which keeps track of your wish list and your debt\n&gt;&gt; list. It automatically withdraws from your karma account to pay back your\n&gt;&gt; debts and it automatically withdraws from your karma account to pay for\n&gt;&gt; things on your wish list.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, April 27, 2009 8:36 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Karma Works\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste Narasimha & Rajarshi,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I wish to add or say Echo the same thing in different words.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Please Consider this -\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; A Cheats B (Say for the instance that Cycle started now)\n&gt;&gt; Next time B gets the oppotunity and strong desire to cheat A and B does \n&gt;&gt; it\n&gt;&gt; with sense of EGO and enjoys that rvenge.\n&gt;&gt; Now if A accepts it calmly and naturally without any sadness and without \n&gt;&gt; any\n&gt;&gt; emotions of hatred towards B -Now then i feel that A is out of the\n&gt;&gt; perticular cycle but what about B.

Nature has \n&gt;&gt; &gt; created\n&gt;&gt; &gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; situation where it can be paid back. In other words, Nature has placed\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; person in a position to cheat or hurt you and tempted him to do so.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) That person has succumbed to the temptation, i.e. he has used the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; opportunity provided by Nature. He cheats or hurts you. As he engages \n&gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; action while identifying with the action (&quot;I am doing it&quot;), he now gets \n&gt;&gt; &gt; a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; new karma. He will be paid back later.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Both are correct. From his perspective, he is doing it with \n&gt;&gt; &gt; identification\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and he is incurring a new karma. From your perspective, you are being \n&gt;&gt; &gt; paid\n&gt;&gt; &gt; back for what you did before.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In order to break out of this cycle, accept it when somebody does\n&gt;&gt; &gt; something\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to you. Do not hate the person or pity yourself. Don&#39;t think &quot;why does \n&gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; have to happen to me&quot;. Think only about your current action (&quot;what is \n&gt;&gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; best thing for me to do NOW?&quot;) and do NOT think about what happened, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; why\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; happened, who did it and how things happening to you are unfair.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The tricky thing is when Nature places you in a position to pay back\n&gt;&gt; &gt; somebody else&#39;s bad karma and creates a strong temptation for you to do\n&gt;&gt; &gt; so.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; You may feel a sudden urge from inside to do a bad thing to someone! \n&gt;&gt; &gt; But\n&gt;&gt; &gt; remember one thing. Any thought or action with a sense of doership (&quot;I \n&gt;&gt; &gt; am\n&gt;&gt; &gt; doing&quot;) will create a new karma, even if the other person brought it on\n&gt;&gt; &gt; himself with a previous action.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If you can engage in an action without a sense of doership and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; surrendering\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the action to the Lord completely, you will not incur karma. But that \n&gt;&gt; &gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; very very difficult - almost impossible for most. Of course, you can \n&gt;&gt; &gt; also\n&gt;&gt; &gt; postpone the payback through the use of your *will power*, i.e. avoid \n&gt;&gt; &gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; temptation and not do the bad thing to the other person. As long as we\n&gt;&gt; &gt; live\n&gt;&gt; &gt; in a body, some karmas will need to be incurred. But good discretion,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; self-control and strong will power will enable one to postpone the most\n&gt;&gt; &gt; troublesome karmas to a later time.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; When the reactions to your previous karmas are paid back and through \n&gt;&gt; &gt; who\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; not in YOUR control. Nature and the will power of others decide that. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; So\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can do nothing except accept what comes. But what you DO NOW is to a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; large\n&gt;&gt; &gt; extent under your control. Use your will power to do the right things.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; &gt; From: &quot;kritels&quot; &lt;kritels@grouply. com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, April 26, 2009 2:19 PM\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Karma Works\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Narasimha Garu,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks you for the beautiful explanation.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not very clear on some of the points you have mentioned:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is it that everything that is happening to us in this life is all\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; reaction\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to some of our past actions?it is difficult for me to understand \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; this.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To me, it can also be that someone is pushing this suffering onto us \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; his action than a reaction of our old karmas.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In any case, if we are getting cheated and we know it clearly why \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; should\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; we sit back and just let things happen against us, why should we not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; fight\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; back?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; KK\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Does he live \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the greater Boston area too?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Karma and karmaphala (action and reaction) are like pushing \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; something\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; being pushing back as a reaction.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; When you karmically push an object with some force and that object\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pushes\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you back karmically with the same force at a later point of time, it \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; not necessary that you resist it and apply some more force to push\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; again.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; You pushed it earlier. That is action. You are being pushed now. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; That\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reaction. How you take this push and whether you resist or not has\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; nothing to do with the old action and reaction balance. IF you \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; resist\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; apply some force NOW, it becomes a new action which will get its\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reaction\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; later.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Even a person of a high level of mental equanimity and stability \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; does\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; have an ego. Each living person has a limited ego (I-ness) which \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; binds\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; him to a body and an identity (e.g. PVR Narasimha Rao, who looks \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; like\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; this, who knows so and so things, who does so and so things, who \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wants\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; so\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and so things, who is the husband of Padmaja, who is the father of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sriharini and Sriharish, who is the sishya of Manish Pandit etc \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; etc).\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the binding is completely removed and one becomes completely unbound\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that limited sense of I-ness, one will no longer remain in the body. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; So\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; any embodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). As one dies and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; gets\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one body and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; environment and re-attached to another body and environment. Nature\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tracks this change. Just as post office delivers all mail addressed \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your old apartment to your new apartment when you change address,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Nature\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; delivers the reactions of all previous life actions to the sense of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I-ness in this life.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As long as one is embodied and has a sense of I-ness, Nature will\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; continue to deliver the reactions to various previous actions from \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; being. Death of wife in an accident, getting an Oscar award, losing \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; election, being criticized by thousand people, being hit by wife, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; being\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; abused by husband, being killed by a brother, being cheated by a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; friend\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; etc etc are examples of reactions to previous actions. As long as \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sense of I-ness is bound to a body, Nature will continue to deliver\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reactions to previous actions. If one gets an Oscar award as a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; result\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; previous good karma, it is not necessary that one should be happy or\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; excited or elated. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; good\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction makes one happy. How one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; feels\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necessary that one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; should\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; bad\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction disappoints him. You \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cheated\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; someone. Nature will arrange such that that person cheats you now. \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; How\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you feel about it now is not relevant as far as the old \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; action-reaction\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; equation is concerned. Thus, being equanimous, equal-minded and calm\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; does\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; not stop Nature from doing its job.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; In fact, it is better that way. By not reacting to what is happening\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; now,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; one is preventing new karmas. Suppose you cheated a person in a\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; previous\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; life. Suppose Nature arranged for that person to cheat you now. His\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cheating you is merely a reaction to your own action (but if he does \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with self-identification with the action, it becomes a new karma for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; person. But, that is irrelevant to you). If you just face it calmly \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; without doing anything, you finish off your karmic debt. Instead,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; suppose\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you fight and try to stop the person from cheating you. Then your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; current\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; actions would become a NEW karma and you will have to face its \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reaction\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; later. If you want to pay off old debts without incurring new ones, \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; have to behave like the person you described below. Accept whatever\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; comes\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your way with neither happiness nor sadness, but with a calm and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; relaxed\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mind. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the right thing to do \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; at\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the moment, with as little self-identification (sense of &quot;I am doing\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; this&quot;) as possible. As you become better at this, your instincts and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; judgment will guide you better and show you the right action.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Karma\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimhaji,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How does one burn their karmas if they are able to be in a neutral\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; frame\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of mind and not be affected by what is percieved as misfortune?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; A close family friend of ours lost his wife in a road accident a \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; few\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; years\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ago. Her head was crashed into a pulp right before his eyes. He \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; very\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; calmly picked her up, took her to the hospital and took care of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; all\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duties towards her and the family. His wife was a very spiritual\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; person\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and so is he. Right before the accident, his wife told him of her\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; recent\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meditation experience and that she would probably be leaving her \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; body\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; soon. her husband never shed a tear and was in the utmost calm and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cheerful frame of mind even during the funeral process. Some folks\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; felt\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to be a bit odd. He is a highly educated professor with a stable\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mind.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; His\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wife and he shared a very high spiritual and mental bond and they\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; have\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; two\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; teenage sons. I have the utmost reverance towards him and also in \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; awe\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his spiritual level. My question is how would his karmas be burnt \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; if\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; never feels the pain of such a perceived tragedy?\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;name deleted for privacy&gt;\n\n\n"}}
