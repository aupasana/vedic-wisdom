Human body=\r\n is naturally suited for an omnivorous diet. Just like \n\n&gt; people do not ea=\r\nt raw meat, normally, people do not eat raw vegetables as well. \n\n&gt; Cooking=\r\n is a later addition to human society. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; If you were to clear you=\r\nr mind of all preconcieved ideas and look at REAL \n\n&gt; research in the most =\r\nunbiased way possible, and accessed scientific papers in \n\n&gt; clinical nutri=\r\ntion and dietetics, as latest as 2010 june/july, you would find \n\n&gt; ample e=\r\nvidence that humans as a speicies, for many milleniums have relied on an \n\n=\r\n&gt; omnivorous diet:-\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; a) Human ancestral diets changed substantially a=\r\npproximately four to five \n\n&gt; million years ago with major climatic changes=\r\n creating open grassland \n\n&gt; environments. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; b) Humans developed =\r\na larger brain balanced by a smaller, simpler \n\n&gt; gastrointestinal tract=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0 requiring=C3=82=C2=A0foods based around meat protein and fat. For=\r\n \n\n&gt; example since the time of Australopithecus afarensis, some four to fiv=\r\ne million \n\n&gt; years ago, brain size has increased threefold - chemical requ=\r\nirement for \n\n&gt; long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain -=\r\n without a \n\n&gt; corresponding increase in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is =\r\npossible only with a \n\n&gt; diet that is rich is animal protein. Simply put, i=\r\nn layman terms, our brain \n\n&gt; would not have reached the size and mass as i=\r\nt is today, had it not been for \n\n&gt; diet comprising of meat, fruits and veg=\r\netables. \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; c) The gut morphology of the human body as it stand to=\r\ndays is ideally \n\n&gt; equidistant from that of carnivores as well as herbivor=\r\nes. That is because \n\n&gt; humans are designed to be omnivores. The lack of a =\r\nwell developed caecum and \n\n&gt; rumen, unlike herbivores, makes it difficult =\r\nfor the body to absorve plant \n\n&gt; cellulose into usable energy, which is wh=\r\ny, a=C3=82=C2=A0major part of the leafy vegetable \n\n&gt; based diet eventually=\r\n ends up as roughage. On the other hand, the stomach lining \n\n&gt; of humans d=\r\no not contain=C3=82=C2=A0 the kind of strong acids which is present in a ty=\r\npical \n\n&gt; carnivore. This is because, humans, diet as set by Nature through=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0 the natural \n\n&gt; process of evolution is supposed to be omnivor=\r\nous. It may further interest you \n\n&gt; to know that the teeth structure of hu=\r\nmans is actually identical to, guess what, \n\n&gt; rats who also are omnivores.=\r\n\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; d) It may shock many a preconcieved and mistaken ideas that=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0research into \n\n&gt; clinical nutrition very clearly indicates that abso=\r\nrption ability of the human \n\n&gt; body for=C3=82=C2=A0w.r.t different foods=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0is highest (not vegetables or fruits) for fish, \n\n&gt; and lowest =\r\nfor red meat and carrots. Infact the later is considered negative \n\n&gt; calor=\r\nie food, since it requires the body to waste more calories in absorving it =\r\n\n\n&gt; than the amount it gains from them. But fish is the easiet to digest. Y=\r\nou can \n\n&gt; look up actual BV (biological value)=C3=82=C2=A0charts for more =\r\ndetails.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; All this is science. Real science.

Human body is naturally suited for an omnivorous diet. Just like=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; people do not eat raw meat, normally, people do not eat raw vege=\r\ntables as well. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Cooking is a later addition to human society. &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; If you were to clear your mind of all preconciev=\r\ned ideas and look at REAL &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; research in the most unbiased way possi=\r\nble, and accessed scientific papers in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; clinical nutrition and die=\r\ntetics, as latest as 2010 june/july, you would find &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ample evidenc=\r\ne that humans as a speicies, for many milleniums have relied on an &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; omnivorous diet:-&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a) Human ancestral diets changed sub=\r\nstantially approximately four to five &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; million years ago with majo=\r\nr climatic changes creating open grassland &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; environments. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; b) Humans developed a larger brain balanced by a smal=\r\nler, simpler &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; gastrointestinal tract=C3=82&nbsp; requiring=C3=82&n=\r\nbsp;foods based around meat protein and fat. For &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; example since th=\r\ne time of Australopithecus afarensis, some four to five million &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; y=\r\nears ago, brain size has increased threefold - chemical requirement for &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain - without =\r\na &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; corresponding increase in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is pos=\r\nsible only with a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; diet that is rich is animal protein. Simply put=\r\n, in layman terms, our brain &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; would not have reached the size and =\r\nmass as it is today, had it not been for &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; diet comprising of meat,=\r\n fruits and vegetables. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; c) The gut morphology=\r\n of the human body as it stand todays is ideally &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; equidistant from=\r\n that of carnivores as well as herbivores. That is because &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; humans=\r\n are designed to be omnivores. The lack of a well developed caecum and &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; rumen, unlike herbivores, makes it difficult for the body to absorve =\r\nplant &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; cellulose into usable energy, which is why, a=C3=82&nbsp;ma=\r\njor part of the leafy vegetable &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; based diet eventually ends up as =\r\nroughage. On the other hand, the stomach lining &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of humans do not =\r\ncontain=C3=82&nbsp; the kind of strong acids which is present in a typical =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; carnivore. This is because, humans, diet as set by Nature through=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp; the natural &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; process of evolution is supposed to be o=\r\nmnivorous. It may further interest you &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to know that the teeth str=\r\nucture of humans is actually identical to, guess what, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; rats who a=\r\nlso are omnivores.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; d) It may shock many a preconcieved a=\r\nnd mistaken ideas that=C3=82&nbsp;research into &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; clinical nutritio=\r\nn very clearly indicates that absorption ability of the human &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; bod=\r\ny for=C3=82&nbsp;w.r.t different foods=C3=82&nbsp;is highest (not vegetable=\r\ns or fruits) for fish, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and lowest for red meat and carrots. Infac=\r\nt the later is considered negative &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; calorie food, since it require=\r\ns the body to waste more calories in absorving it &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; than the amount=\r\n it gains from them. But fish is the easiet to digest. You can &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lo=\r\nok up actual BV (biological value)=C3=82&nbsp;charts for more details.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; All this is science.
