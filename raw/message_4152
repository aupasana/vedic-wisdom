At first I thought it meant something=\r\n like maybe my sadhana is starting to bring towards enlightenment or some n=\r\nonsense like that. The other thing I notice is that whenever there is some =\r\nviewing of &#39;pheonomena&#39; that my rational mind wants to interpret it, as if =\r\nI were being shown some special nimitta that need to be interpreted. In the=\r\n railway station where I live the platform has these tiles coloured bright =\r\nyellow, while waiting for train i will stare down at the ground at these ti=\r\nles, after a while I will begin to see color purple on the ground. Interest=\r\ning indeed...\n\nThere is this natural occuring pheonomenon called flashing c=\r\nolors where there is a corresponding color for every primary and simple com=\r\npound color. Take a bright singly coloured piece of paper or fabric and gaz=\r\ne at it for a few minutes, then remove it and gaze at the white wall or som=\r\nething similar and see a luminescent flashing color. Yellow and Purple. Red=\r\n and Green. Blue and Orange.\n\nTry it you&#39;ll see its very natural. It also o=\r\nccurs from gazing at the sun. There will be shades of indigo, purple and ma=\r\ngenta. What does it mean? nothing really....or perhaps we have only scratch=\r\ned the surface of truly experiencing our visual sense. From flat monochrome=\r\n to brilliant multidimesional luminosity.\n\nmy 2 cents.....\n\nAjaya\n\n--- In v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nisha_muktewar&quot; &lt;nisha_muktewar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am trying to seek an answer for certain experiences. I w=\r\nould be obliged if anyone can share his/ her thoughts (or suggested reading=\r\n material) on this. \n&gt; \n&gt; These days whenever I close my eyes even for a wh=\r\nile I can see a purple color, sometimes even with a magenta combination.  T=\r\no go a step further, at times while talking to someone if I casually close =\r\nmy eyes I can his/ her image with all the red, orange, yellow & blue colors=\r\n (something like an aura). However, I do not see an image for each and ever=\r\ny person. At certain times, I have seen colors for objects/ non-living bein=\r\ngs too. And at the same time I might not see anything with my eyes closed e=\r\nven when the room is full of people.  Splashing water on my face feels like=\r\n spraying blue shades on red/magenta. Not sure, why this is and if it makes=\r\n any sense.\n&gt; \n&gt; Its been almost more than a month now and I am really curi=\r\nous to find out the reason. Earlier, I even thought that I may have some pr=\r\noblem with my eyes. Generally, the only time I see these colors (especially=\r\n purple & green) is while meditating. To be honest, although I pray to God =\r\ndaily, I havent been getting enough time to meditate regularly for the past=\r\n few weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Gargi\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
