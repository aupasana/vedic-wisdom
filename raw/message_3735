See the mid section high=\r\nlighted which directly answer your questions.\n&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt; I do not remember the exact source of this me=\r\nssage but had in my hard disk so doing a reproduction from there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear=\r\n Narasimha, Sanjay and others\n&gt; \n&gt; Ganesha. Why should one worship Ganesha =\r\nor Rudra or Chandika or Mahakala.\n&gt; In fact can anybody actually worship an=\r\ny deity.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. The fact of the matter is that one&#39;s mind will be drawn to=\r\n the worship of deities which one has worshipped in past lives.\n&gt; 2. But, w=\r\nhether one will achive or not with that aspect of the divine is based on\n&gt; =\r\na. What is the residue of karmas which one has left? Karana Shareera basica=\r\nlly is responsible for this.One in a million\n&gt; individuals will achieve the=\r\n burning of the Karana Shareera. But when this is being done, then every ka=\r\nrma done to that person\n&gt; to his body or mind, good or bad must have an alm=\r\nost hundred times more intensity result, like for like.\n&gt; \n&gt; b. What is the=\r\n intensity of the desire of that person for the Divine Beloved?\n&gt; Which aga=\r\nin boils down to the amount of karmas left in that Karana Shareera. The thi=\r\ncker the overlay of karmas, the lesser the desire to actually perform any k=\r\nind of worship.\n&gt; \n&gt; People talk about mantras, mahamantras, and all this.\n=\r\n&gt; I find that it simply does not matter.\n&gt; Every mantra is a name (nam), ev=\r\nery nam has a form (rupa).\n&gt; So, when the mantra is chanted, the rupa is fo=\r\nrming.\n&gt; Where is the rupa forming?\n&gt; In the physical body, mind, koshas an=\r\nd everywhere.\n&gt; So the deity will actually occupy the person.\n&gt; But when ca=\r\nn this happen?\n&gt; Only when the body is dead. Not dead physically, but in a =\r\ndifferent sense.\n&gt; ie. ASANA: the mind forgets the body exists after a few =\r\nhours of sitting really still for a few hours a day.\n&gt; Pranayana: the mind =\r\nreflects on the breath and feels it is alive, it tries to still the breath.=\r\n\n&gt; Dhyana, the rupa of the deity forms in the mind, remember the body is de=\r\nad for the mind at this stage.\n&gt; Dharana: The mind percieves that form of G=\r\nod which is the object of the consciousness, but duality exists.\n&gt; Pratyaha=\r\nra: a phenomenon where the eyes do not see, the ears do not hear.\n&gt; Samadhi=\r\n: the rupa is so well established, that the ultimate form of that rupa, tha=\r\nt mantra, the Nirguna manifests.\n&gt; \n&gt; So the emptiness must come about in t=\r\nhe mind and body about one&#39;s own identity before God fills it up with His f=\r\norm.\n&gt; So, mantra is simply a tool to make us realise God. Anybody can do m=\r\nantras, but most people&#39;s internal fire or Agni is\n&gt; not really charged up =\r\nto digest these.\n&gt; Japa is no doubt great, but it is involved with the puri=\r\nfication of air, whereas fire is involved in the purification of internal f=\r\nire.\n&gt; When internal fire is purified, then the ability to visualise your d=\r\neity becomes stronger. Hence homam in this age is easy and moreover, Agni i=\r\ns a living God, pratyaksha Devata who can be seen by your physical eyes.\n&gt; =\r\nIt moves, eats, talks with the sadhaka and finally when it dies, it continu=\r\nes to live on within the sadhaka.\n&gt; In Kali Yuga, this ability to call a li=\r\nving God into the house is so powerful and so exhalting that later on japa =\r\nafter homam\n&gt; brings very fast results.\n&gt; *******************************\n&gt;=\r\n Why Ganesha? Most people do not want spirituality, and in any case are not=\r\n destined to be spiritual in this lifetime, so the only way they will pursu=\r\ne some sadhana is if they are given some material result quite quickly by t=\r\nheir sadhana.\n&gt; Those who have problems in career, litigation, problems wit=\r\nh marriage or in finding life partner, problems with education or speech ca=\r\nn really advance their mundane satisfaction with Ganapati homa.\n&gt; I have se=\r\nen this numerous times myself with people who are in this movement and outs=\r\nide.\n&gt; That is not to say that Ganapati can&#39;t give Mukti. The ultimate form=\r\n of Ganapati is the word of God.\n&gt; And He is sakshama in giving Mukti as we=\r\nll.\n&gt; ************************************\n&gt; The mahamantras are many and I=\r\n agree that some may say that lets do this(mahamantras) first.\n&gt; BUT,\n&gt; The=\r\n Vedic mahamantras require the kind of intonation so perfect with visualisa=\r\ntion at different bits of the body with various syllables, that for most pe=\r\nople this is not feasible, especially since their Sanskrit itself is somewh=\r\nat imperfect.(remember name is form, if name is not repeated properly then =\r\nhow will the form be?)(example, of someone who repeated bhakshati for raksh=\r\nati in Pune many years ago).\n&gt; And then there are mahamantras which are ok =\r\nwith almost any intonation. If someone wants to follow this that is also ok=\r\n.\n&gt; But, with any mantra sadhana, Ganesha sadhana is anivarya. Because, the=\r\n entrance to Shakti at Sushumna is guarded by Him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Again some doubt co=\r\nmes into people&#39;s heads about some mantras harming them when recited:\n&gt; If =\r\nsomebody experiences bad things when a mantra of a certain deity is recited=\r\n then all it means is that the karmas of the Karana shareera are being deal=\r\nt with(by the deity) quite fast, so they have to be experienced. It actuall=\r\ny means that the Devata is close and more intense sadhana is needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nctually, all this business about mantra and mahamantra is immaterial, Allah=\r\n malik Hai, voh sab janta hai.\n&gt; Us parvardigar se prarthana kar, woh sab r=\r\naste khol deta hai.\n&gt; -------------------------------------\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best=\r\n regards,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Ravi Gollapalli.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 2/16/10,=\r\n biswa108 &lt;biswa1975@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: biswa108 &lt;biswa1975@...&gt;\n&gt; S=\r\nubject: [vedic-wisdom] About Ganapati Homam...Can it bring prosperity and p=\r\neace?\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, February 16, 2010=\r\n, 10:57 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; NAMASKAR\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Gurujis,\n&gt; \n&gt; I ha=\r\nve started MAHAGANAPATI HOMAM, though started with super-short procedure, n=\r\now I am including more rituals and sanskrit verse from the short procedure =\r\neventually.. .\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I am asking some bare minimum questions...\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. =\r\nWhat is the sign that my Ganapati Homam are successful or not?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.
