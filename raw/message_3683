---\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  *The Holy Grass known as Dharbham or Dharbai=\r\n*\n&gt;\n&gt; by* TRS Iyengar\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *\n&gt;\n&gt; This article is on one of the practices=\r\n widely used by Indian Brahmins all\n&gt; over\n&gt; using a Holy Grass named Dharb=\r\nham or Dharbai.\n&gt; In all functions, auspicious orinauspicious,\n&gt; a performi=\r\nng person needs to wear a ring made of this Dharbham.\n&gt; But many have lost =\r\nthe reason of why it is to be used in the first place.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; What I lea=\r\nrnt from my father is proved to be accurately correct by a\n&gt; Medicine\n&gt; Pra=\r\nctitioner.\n&gt;\n&gt; A Doctor named Sadhashiv Rao, once visited my home.\n&gt; When t=\r\nhetopic turned to many subjects,\n&gt; I needed to tell him about the Holy Gras=\r\ns named\n&gt; Dharbham.\n&gt; When I told him about the usage and the values,\n&gt; he =\r\ncould not just believe my words.\n&gt; *\n&gt; So, he took out a bunch of the Dharb=\r\nham from me,\n&gt; went straight to the clinic to take an x-ray of his palm,\n&gt; =\r\nby covering his hand\n&gt; with the Dharbham.\n&gt; To his utter surprise,\n&gt; he fou=\r\nnd that the grass absorbed\n&gt; about 60% of the radiation!*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; When th=\r\ne so powerful X-ray radiation can be absorbed by the Holy Grass,\n&gt; why can =\r\nit not absorb the ill radiations spread over the atmosphere?\n&gt; While chanti=\r\nng\n&gt; and reciting some Vedic phrases and versus,\n&gt; one needs to wear a ring=\r\n made of Dharbham\n&gt; on his right hand ring finger.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The count of l=\r\neaves depends upon the function that is held viz.:\n&gt; for some functions rel=\r\nated to death\n&gt; only Single leafed Dharbham is used;\n&gt;\n&gt; for Auspicious and=\r\n daily routine\n&gt; a ring made of two leaves is used;\n&gt; for inauspicious but =\r\nnot death related functions,\n&gt; (i.e. Amavasya Tharppanam,Pithru Pooja etc)\n=\r\n&gt; a three leaf Dharbham ring is used.\n&gt;\n&gt; And for the Temple Prayer and Poo=\r\nja,\n&gt; a Four-leaf Dharbham ring is used.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *Also, when a fire rit=\r\nual known as Agni Santana is performed,\n&gt; these Dharbham are spread all the=\r\n four sides of the Agni Kundam.\n&gt; Also, during the Eclipse time,\n&gt; these Dh=\r\narbham are used to cover all food items to protect them\n&gt; from the harmful =\r\nultra violet radiation.*\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Whenever any function is held,\n&gt; firstly t=\r\nhey perform a site-cleansing act known\n&gt; as =93Sudhhi Punyaahavachanam=94.\n=\r\n&gt; While reciting the selective versus,\n&gt; they hold\n&gt; the Dharbham bunch in =\r\ntheir hand and\n&gt; placing the tip point of it over the vessel containing wat=\r\ner.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus the recited vibration values are absorbed by water in the\n&gt; ve=\r\nssel through the Dharbham.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; They found that the Holy Grass known as =\r\nDharbham has the highest value in\n&gt; conducting the phonetic vibrations thro=\r\nugh its tip.\n&gt; Later, they sprinkle the Holy water at every nook and corner=\r\n of the place,\n&gt; where the function is held.\n&gt;\n&gt; A Dharbham without the tip=\r\n is considered of no value, as the\n&gt; conductor-type value is lost in it.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; My father, Late Shri Ramabathrachariar of Mukkur,\n&gt; fondly called b=\r\ny everyone\n&gt; as Sriraman, has given me the immense values of Dharbham and i=\r\nts usage.\n&gt; With Sanskrit phonetic sound and vibration,\n&gt; using the Dharbha=\r\nm increases its value.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The usage varies according to the functions.\n&gt;=\r\n It is really a marvel, that\n&gt; in those days of Vedic Era,\n&gt; the Sages & Sa=\r\nints of Hindu land used to control\n&gt; the Magnetic path disturbances,\n&gt; just=\r\n by simply using this Dharbham!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Apart from the above, Dharbham cann=\r\not be planted and grown everywhere.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; It only grows naturally at select=\r\nive places and available almost in every\n&gt; state in India.\n&gt; Some learned s=\r\ncholars name it after Saint Vishwaamitra -\n&gt; hence Dharbham is known and ca=\r\nlled as Vishwaamitra.\n&gt; If it is kept for a\n&gt; longer time, say for more tha=\r\nn six months,\n&gt; then it loses it value and\n&gt; the power of absorbing the rad=\r\niation or magnetic path control values.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dharbham cannot just be pluck=\r\ned straight or cut on any day;\n&gt; There is a specific Slokha that is to be r=\r\necited before cutting it;\n&gt;\n&gt; That too it can\n&gt; be cut only on the day next=\r\n to Full Moon - known as Krishna Paksha\n&gt; Pradamai.\n&gt;\n&gt; A Dharbham without =\r\nits tip portion is not to be used for making\n&gt; a Ring like item known as &quot;P=\r\navithram&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;
