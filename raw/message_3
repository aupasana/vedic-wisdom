Please bear wit=\r\nh my non-coherence here. I am writing after a long time and want to cover a=\r\n few different things.\n \nBefore I forget, one small point. Moon in Taurus a=\r\nnd Sun, Mars and Jupiter in Scorpio will be aspecting each other during Sun=\r\nday-Tuesday. This is a good time for sadhana.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBefor=\r\ne I go on a rambling spree, I need to address one specific point.\n \n&gt; &gt;But =\r\nwhat I really have question is, that by \n&gt; &gt;chanting Navagraha mantra or go=\r\ning up the \n&gt; &gt;mountain in bear foot, which actually do not \n&gt; &gt;remedy any =\r\nbeings&#39; suffering, that somehow our past eveil deeds are nullified.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\nThis common theorem propagated by Hindu \n&gt; &gt;astrologers have not answer the=\r\n Law of Cause and \n&gt; &gt;Effect. Suppose someone killes others for money. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\nThen in next or immidiate life, he must suffere poverty and violent death.\n=\r\n \nLet me respectfully state that you have a very limited view on what being=\r\ns are out there and what they are experiencing.\n \nIf I mentally chant the V=\r\nedic mantra of a planet with perfect swaram for 8 hours continuously, do yo=\r\nu think no beings are affected by it?\n \nFirst of all, even going by materia=\r\nl subjects such as modern science, there are millions or billions of beings=\r\n (microbodies) within our physical bodies.\n \nSecondly, if you go beyond mat=\r\nerial subjects and accept spiritual experience as a pramaana, the entire un=\r\niverse and all gods are within. Rishis taught that all the worlds, all the =\r\ndeities and all the beings exist within one&#39;s sushumna nadi. Of course, our=\r\n sleepy self-awareness is limited to bhooloka (moolaadhaara chakra) and hen=\r\nce we do not perceive all this normally. But, it is possible to actually ex=\r\nperience that various lokas and devas are within oneself. Unfortunately, it=\r\n cannot be experienced by everybody, because waking up one&#39;s sleepy self-aw=\r\nareness and purifying it is difficult, and hence science will not accept it=\r\n.\n \nWhether you accept that the entire universe is within or not, the botto=\r\nmline is that there are so many beings within us. They are affected by our =\r\nthoughts and the chemicals (at the gross level) and energies (at the subtle=\r\n level) produced by those thoughts.\n \nEach thought and action of ours chang=\r\nes the lives of so many beings that are within us! It may be mind-boggling =\r\nto think of this, but it is so true. Vedic mantras are special and chanting=\r\n them creates specific energy patterns in various energy centers and channe=\r\nls of the body. So, of course, they have the potential to &quot;remedy some bein=\r\ngs&#39; suffering&quot; (suffering of millions of beings that live within us).\n \nMan=\r\ntra involves sound or vibration. This vibration is not just of particles at=\r\n sthoola sareera (gross) level, but at sookshma sareera and kaarana sareera=\r\n level also. The vibration produced by the physical sound (vaikhari) coming=\r\n out of physical mouth (sthoola sareera) is only the gross aspect of the sa=\r\nbda. The subtle vibrations produced by imagery in the mind and thoughts are=\r\n as important (if not more important). Out of the four divisions of sabda, =\r\nvaikhari is the least important. Madhyama, Pasyanti and Para are increasing=\r\nly important.\n \nWhen a great maharshi chants a Vedic mantra even a few time=\r\ns, such a harmonious blend of the vibrations is produced at various levels =\r\n(sthoola/sookshma/kaarana/mahaakaarana sareeras) that paraa level of sabda =\r\nis so strong that strong vibrations are created by it in the mahaakaarana s=\r\nareera. Thus, the entire universe can vibrate to the mantra!\n \n*        *  =\r\n      *\n \n&gt; &gt;I for example chanted certain Navagraha mantra \n&gt; &gt;from mornin=\r\ng to sunset without food, drink and \n&gt; &gt;toilet, compleated the numbers requ=\r\nired, Nothing happened.\n \nIf one sowed a seed and a plant did not come, may=\r\n be one did something wrong. May be one did not put enough water. May be th=\r\nere wasn&#39;t enough sunlight. May be one did not wait enough time. You cannot=\r\n conclude that this seed does not give a plant.\n \nIf you read a graha mantr=\r\na and nothing happened, may be you were imperfect. First of all, try a Vedi=\r\nc mantra. Second of all, try to perfect the intonation. Third of all, try t=\r\no focus all your conscious and sub-conscious energies on the mantra or deit=\r\ny and produce the correct vibrations at all levels.\n\nIf you succeed even 1%=\r\n in that, Vedic mantras do produce tremendous results. Even a fool like me =\r\nwho knows not much has seen the power of these Vedic mantras.\n \nAnother thi=\r\nng:\n \nThe results of properly chanted Vedic mantras may sometimes be someth=\r\ning you have not expected! She (or He, if you prefer) knows what should be =\r\ngiven when. We are like small children who don&#39;t know what is good for us a=\r\nnd bad for us and She is like the mother of children. Sometimes, a child ma=\r\ny not like what mother gives or does, but mother knows the best.\n \nWhen a s=\r\nmall baby has an upset stomach, mother may forcefully put her finger at the=\r\n base of the tongue and provoke a vomiting. The child may hate this act, bu=\r\nt this may make his suffering less after one final suffering. Similarly, so=\r\nme properly done Vedic remedies sometimes bring one big trouble (like the v=\r\nomiting) and much relief later. Also, one bad karma may be blocking a lot o=\r\nf good karmas and the planet may have to force the fructification of the ba=\r\nd karma before many good karmas fructify.\n \nIn fact, whenever I did intense=\r\n sadhana for navagrahas (especially Mars) using Vedic mantras, there was im=\r\nmediate suffering for a few days before really good results. In fact, I try=\r\n to not even distinguish between the two and try to consider both as Her bl=\r\nessings. They really are. As astrologers, we keep recommending remedies to =\r\npeople who are materially inclined and want temporary relief (so-called) fr=\r\nom temporary troubles (so-called). But, it is also a good idea to increase =\r\ndevotion and sthita-pragnyata that makes people not distinguish between ple=\r\nasure and sadness.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRegarding one supreme God:\n \nThe=\r\n potential to manifest (Brahman) is ONE and it fills the entire universe, k=\r\nnown as Brahmanda (anda=3Degg, i.e. potential to manifest). Brahman alone e=\r\nxists, Brahman alone is supreme and Brahman alone is unlimited and beyond a=\r\nttributes. Each manifestation of Brahman is limited and has attributes (gun=\r\nas etc). Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra, Agni, Vaayu etc are all different _l=\r\nimited_ manifestations of Brahman with various attributes. Though they are =\r\nall limied, a rishi can see the unlimited Brahman in all of them.\n \nA rishi=\r\n is capable of _seeing_ that everything that exists is actually Brahman onl=\r\ny. When he worships Vishnu, he actually sees Vishnu not as a limited manife=\r\nstation with certain attributes but as Brahman and hence lauds that Vishnu =\r\nis supreme and beyond attributes and that everything and every deity is a d=\r\nifferent manifestation of Vishnu only. For example, Narayana Sooktam says &quot;=\r\nsa brahma sa shivah sa harih&quot;. Similarly, when a rishi worships Ganapathi, =\r\nhe actually sees Ganapathi not as a limied manifestation with certain attri=\r\nbutes but as Brahman and hence lauds that Ganapathi is supreme and beyond a=\r\nttributes and that everything and every deity is a different manifestation =\r\nof Ganapathi only. For example, Ganapathi Atharva Seersham says &quot;tvam brahm=\r\na tvam vishnus-tvam rudras-tvam...&quot;.\n \nYou see similar assertions in Vedic =\r\nliterature with respect to various deities. It is not that rishis are lying=\r\n. It is that they are in such exalted state that they see Brahman in whiche=\r\nver deity they are contemplating. In fact, a rishi in sahaja samadhi state =\r\ncan see Brahman in everything.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThat one God who man=\r\nifestaed differently is the unmanifested supreme potentiality. He/She/It ha=\r\ns no attributes (which come with only a specific manifestation) and normall=\r\ny known as Brahman. When the final goal of a journey has no description, on=\r\ne may describe it based on the path taken in the journey. Similarly, those =\r\nwho worshipped Vishnu and finally reached Brahman through Vishnu describe B=\r\nrahman as Narayana and attribute some of Vishnu&#39;s gunas to Brahman, though =\r\nBrahman has no gunas. Those who worshipped Shiva and finally reached Brahma=\r\nn through Shiva describe Brahman as Sadashiva and attribute some of Shiva&#39;s=\r\n gunas to Brahman though Brahman has no gunas.\n \nAll the fights about the s=\r\nuperiority of deities that occurred in the past are meaningless. Brahman is=\r\n ONE and Brahman alone is. Whether you reach Brahman through Vishnu or Shiv=\r\na or whoever, Brahman you reach is identical. So worship whichever deity yo=\r\nu are attracted to. Try to reach Him/Her. If you are so inclined and believ=\r\ne in the One source of all divinity (Brahman), try to reach Brahman through=\r\n whichever deity you worship. The paths are many, but the final goal is the=\r\n same. Ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti.\n \nAll religions and spiritual path=\r\ns offer valid paths to Brahman. Allah is not different from Brahman, but th=\r\ne path taught by some Islamic teachers to Allah may be different from some =\r\npaths Hindus know to Brahman.\n \nThe advantage of aarsha dharma is that rish=\r\nis have experimented and given some easy paths. If you don&#39;t want it easy a=\r\nnd want to take a difficult path also, that is fine and good in a way. But,=\r\n if you want an easy path, try to follow rishis and use some Vedic mantras.=\r\n\n \n*        *        *\n \nI have recently uploaded Mahaganapathi Homam audio=\r\n and a 25-page manual on my webpage (link below). This is a simple procedur=\r\ne that takes less than an hour and do-able on a daily or weekly basis. I do=\r\n a one-hour homam everyday and can tell you based on my own experience that=\r\n a daily homam is great for spiritual sadhana. When bhootaagni burning in s=\r\nookshma sareera is weak, nadis have impurities and energy flow has obstruct=\r\nions, then most other sadhanas you may be doing will not yield much result.=\r\n Homam as a sadhana is a very effective in increasing bhootaagni, purifying=\r\n nadis and removing obstructions to energy flow. If one is already a realiz=\r\ned soul like Buddha, homam may be unnecessary. But, for the confused souls =\r\nof Kali Yuga, it is a very effective method. Just like with any sadhana, re=\r\ngularity increases effect in homam too. I encourage people interested in th=\r\ne Vedic path to make a small homam (one hour or half hour or atleast 15 min=\r\n) a part of their daily spiritual sadhana. After doing it for a few months,=\r\n you will realize that it will make all your other sadhanas (such as japam)=\r\n much more effective.\n \nThose of you who are more learned must forgive me i=\r\nf you find mistakes in what I am teaching. Instead of teaching a complicate=\r\nd procedure that turns people off, I believe in simplifying it so that peop=\r\nle benefit from it. Moreover, I have retained most important steps and this=\r\n is an almost authentic Vedic agnimukham.\n \nSome people believe that Vedic =\r\nagnimukham based homas cannot be performed by everybody and hence recommend=\r\n Tantrik homas. I am inspired by Saint Gnyaanadeva, who asserted that each =\r\nbeing has the right to recite Veda and made a buffalo recite Veda in front =\r\nof arrogant scholars who forbade him from reciting Veda. I like the Vedic m=\r\nethod and hence teach it to every interested person. May those who disagree=\r\n with me ignore me.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI will be off from the lists ag=\r\nain. BTW, I am not reading any of these yahoogroups. If you need my attenti=\r\non, please send a private mail. But, unfortunately, I am getting only 10 mi=\r\nn everyday to read and reply to mails and I get a lot of mails. My sincere =\r\napologies if I am unable to help you. Please don&#39;t take offense. Even if I =\r\ncannot help you directly, I will be praying to Mother to somehow give direc=\r\ntion to everybody who sought direction from me and failed to get a response=\r\n from me.\n \nMay the light of Brahman shine within,\nNarasimha\n--------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ved=\r\nicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.o=\r\nrg\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n \n&gt; Om =\r\nGurave Namah\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Sanjay,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sahasra namaskara -\n&gt; \n&gt; This is indeed=\r\n an interesting thread, and I too \n&gt; was taken aback by the &quot;Curse Sanjay R=\r\nath&quot; \n&gt; subject title of it.  I had been away for some \n&gt; time, but just ca=\r\nught this today.  Anyway, I \n&gt; would like a bit of clarification on the \n&gt; =\r\nfollowing that you wrote, and would be grateful for your elaboration:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nYou wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;God and demi-god is a concept developed for some \n&gt; &gt;cult =\r\nthinking and htere are no demi-gods. There \n&gt; &gt;isnonly one God and men call=\r\n that one by many \n&gt; &gt;names which is man&#39;s weakness, and not that of god.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; To my knowledge, as learned from my guru, God is \n&gt; indeed one but mani=\r\nfested variously.  For the \n&gt; sake of some very important universal functio=\r\nns, \n&gt; some of the jivas play important roles, such as \n&gt; Brahma in creatio=\r\nn, Indra in protection, \n&gt; etc.  These jivas are described in the \n&gt; Bhagav=\r\nad-gita as &quot;Devas,&quot; and are definitely a \n&gt; distinction that God, Sri Krsna=\r\n makes \n&gt; Himself.  Do you recall the verse from \n&gt; Bhagavad-gita, &quot;Devan d=\r\neva-yajo yanti, mad bhakta \n&gt; yanti mam api,&quot; or &quot;Those who worship the dev=\r\nas \n&gt; (demigods) go to the planets of the demigods \n&gt; (after death), wherea=\r\ns those who worship Me, come \n&gt; to Me.&quot;? So the concept of God and demigod =\r\n\n&gt; (almighty, and His empowered parts and parcels) \n&gt; is not something of a=\r\n cult thinking, but rather \n&gt; that of the Lord Himself.  But you know this,=\r\n \n&gt; don&#39;t you, and am I not preaching to the choir here?\n&gt; \n&gt; So far as man=\r\ny names of God, yes there are \n&gt; infinite names, and these are mentioned in=\r\n \n&gt; various scriptures to describe but a minute \n&gt; fraction of His immense =\r\npotencies and Lilas.  Why \n&gt; is the awareness of various names of God \n&gt; in=\r\ndicative of man&#39;s weakness?  Further, in ISKCON \n&gt; the infinite names of Go=\r\nd as described in various \n&gt; scriptures are known, recited, and worshipped,=\r\n \n&gt; yet indeed the distinction between God and \n&gt; demigod is taught as well=\r\n.  Where did you get the \n&gt; idea that ISKCON devotees only knew or worshipp=\r\ned one or two names of God?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Why do you hate ISKCON? I have heard one =\r\nelder \n&gt; &gt;sadhu telling that God sends you to be born in \n&gt; &gt;the lands of t=\r\nhose you fight against, in the \n&gt; &gt;religion of those you hate, in the house=\r\ns of \n&gt; &gt;those who have a debt to repay to you!!! I am \n&gt; &gt;sure you don&#39;t w=\r\nant to be reborn as an ISKCON \n&gt; &gt;member nor as a buddhist. So my humble \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;submission is that you should love ISKCON and \n&gt; &gt;love Buddhists, then yo=\r\nu can stay away from them forever!!!\n&gt; \n&gt; If I had the chance to take birth=\r\n a million times \n&gt; as a member of ISKCON, I would think myself as \n&gt; the m=\r\nost fortunate person, as ISKCON was the \n&gt; creation of His Divine Grace A.C=\r\n. Bhaktivedanta \n&gt; Swami Prabhupada, perhaps the greatest saint to \n&gt; walk =\r\nthe face of the earth in the 20th \n&gt; century.  Believe me when I say this: =\r\n had he not \n&gt; come with his tireless effort to implant Sanatana \n&gt; dharma =\r\nand Vedic knowledge within the minds of \n&gt; all those outside of India, then=\r\n it is doubtful \n&gt; that anyone outside of India would even have \n&gt; heard of=\r\n the Vedas, what to speak of Jyotish.  So \n&gt; far as the misgivings or trans=\r\ngressions of some \n&gt; of my godbrothers are concerned, each and every \n&gt; one=\r\n of them will be accountable for the results \n&gt; of their actions.  Those wh=\r\no follow the teachings \n&gt; of the Gaudiya Vaishnava parampara strictly, will=\r\n \n&gt; attain the highest moksa, and there is no doubt \n&gt; about this.  So inst=\r\nead of elaborating on the \n&gt; sins of some fallen disciples, and making this=\r\n \n&gt; the epitaph of the society called ISKCON, maybe \n&gt; spend a little time =\r\nto learn the history of the \n&gt; great good that the ISKCON devotees did in t=\r\nhe \n&gt; period during Prabhupada&#39;s existence on this earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I agree =\r\nthat Silva, the gentleman who started \n&gt; this thread, wreaks with a bit of =\r\nhate, wouldn&#39;t \n&gt; you agree?  In that regard the message of oneness \n&gt; and =\r\nacceptance is a very good and healing one.\n&gt; \n&gt; My best to you,\n&gt; With warm=\r\n regards,\n&gt; Robert\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;One final thing - what have I done to you to=\r\n get \n&gt; &gt;the subject of this mail as &#39; - Curse Sanjay Rath&#39;?\n&gt; &gt;Best wishes=\r\n and warm regards,\n&gt; &gt;Sanjay Rath\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt; &gt;Personal: &lt;http://srath.com/blog/&gt;WebPages =\r\n=C3=A2=E2=80=94=C2=8F \n&gt; &gt;&lt;http://srath.com/blog/&gt;Rath=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=\r\n=A2s Rhapsody\n&gt; &gt;SJC WebPages: &lt;http://srijagannath.org/&gt;Sri \n&gt; &gt;Jagannath =\r\nCenter =C3=A2=E2=80=94=C2=8F &lt;http://sjcerc.com/&gt;SJCERC =C3=A2=E2=80=94=C2=\r\n=8F &lt;http://jiva.us/&gt;JIVA\n&gt; &gt;Publications: &lt;http://thejyotishdigest.com/&gt;Th=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt;Jyotish Digest =C3=A2=E2=80=94=C2=8F \n&gt; &gt;&lt;http://sagittariuspublicati=\r\nons.com/&gt;Sagittarius Publications\n&gt; &gt;--------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;----------\n&gt; &gt;From: sohamsa=\r\n@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;[mailto:sohamsa@yahoogroups.com] On Behalf Of silva gr=\r\naduate\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Saturday, November 04, 2006 10:19 AM\n&gt; &gt;To: sohamsa@yahoogr=\r\noups.com\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: Fwd: RE: [sohamsa] Trouble from \n&gt; &gt;Sons - Curse S=\r\nanjay Rath :Confidential\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;This is rather a confidendial matter and I =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;request this email be shared only with Sanjayji and you.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I see t=\r\nhat SJC is ISKCON similar line of \n&gt; &gt;thought, that means holds Sri Krsna a=\r\ns Supreme God.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;However, Veda ( samhita potions only genuine ) \n&gt; &gt;do=\r\n not proclaim this view.

All=\r\n entities are under \n&gt; &gt;Navagraha  ( at leaset  in our Solar Systm ). \n&gt; &gt;S=\r\no, if some people have Shani dosha, it is \n&gt; &gt;understandable that they must=\r\n feed crows or \n&gt; &gt;serve old or homeless, black dogs, etc, since \n&gt; &gt;all en=\r\ntities are united in energy level ( Unified Field Theory ).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;But what=\r\n I really have question is, that by \n&gt; &gt;chanting Navagraha mantra or going =\r\nup the \n&gt; &gt;mountain in bear foot, which actually do not \n&gt; &gt;remedy any bein=\r\ngs&#39; suffering, that somehow our past eveil deeds are nullified.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;This=\r\n common theorem propagated by Hindu \n&gt; &gt;astrologers have not answer the Law=\r\n of Cause and \n&gt; &gt;Effect. Suppose someone killes others for money. \n&gt; &gt;Then=\r\n in next or immidiate life, he must suffere poverty and violent death.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;How, by supplicating deities which do not have \n&gt; &gt;any authority to bend=\r\n the Law of CAUSE AND \n&gt; &gt;EFFECT which even God cannot do, mitigate our suf=\r\nffering.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;In other words, if we repent and do great works \n&gt; &gt;to help=\r\n and heal all beings around us, our life \n&gt; &gt;become worthy and  necessary f=\r\nor the existence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;But many selfish men such as some fool who ask \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;for a mantra for beauty which is abslultely \n&gt; &gt;childish ( in this forum )=\r\n, believes by mumbling \n&gt; &gt;quasi Sanskrit words ( Sanskrit is very accurate=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;language and must be enunciated properly \n&gt; &gt;)  advocates Navagraha ma=\r\nntras and other \n&gt; &gt;concocted works of post Mahabharata Hinduims.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I =\r\nfor example chanted certain Navagraha mantra \n&gt; &gt;from morning to sunset wit=\r\nhout food, drink and \n&gt; &gt;toilet, compleated the numbers required, Nothing h=\r\nappened.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;My Tamil Brahmin friend ( real brahmin by birth \n&gt; &gt;and qua=\r\nlification and the works of charity ) \n&gt; &gt;also know many mantras and tested=\r\n, but popular \n&gt; &gt;Navagraha tantrik mantras did not work ).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I find, =\r\nthat the puja by proxy advocated by \n&gt; &gt;HIndus and Buddhists, Roman catholi=\r\ncs have \n&gt; &gt;fundamentally selfish. One&#39;s own tapas is the \n&gt; &gt;key to lessen=\r\n the karmic retribution, not some \n&gt; &gt;paid pujari who have no interest nor =\r\ncompassion \n&gt; &gt;for unknown men who send money from somewhere.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I beli=\r\neve there are genuine Upaya. The best of \n&gt; &gt;all is to help children, women=\r\n, animals and handicapped.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;But theere is no such remedies chanting m=\r\nantras \n&gt; &gt;or going on to some mountain in India...not in \n&gt; &gt;the Vedas, BP=\r\nHS and other ancient works of sages.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I think Kali yuga, we all seek =\r\neasy remediy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Indeed the qualified Vedic astrologers are vicar \n&gt; &gt;o=\r\nf Mahakala; they can discern life and death \n&gt; &gt;matter. But how few are tho=\r\nse...I think we can count those in our hands.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Another fundamenta=\r\nl problem for praying to particular deity is this:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Navagraha have be=\r\nen entrusted to execute the \n&gt; &gt;dispensation of karma. What authority some =\r\ngods \n&gt; &gt;or goddesses have to override Navagraha?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Bringing and quoti=\r\nng puranas cannot stand a \n&gt; &gt;logical argument. Saiva, Vaishnava, Shakta al=\r\nl \n&gt; &gt;have their supreme boooks which were written by \n&gt; &gt;their co-religion=\r\ninsts who proclaims that their god is Supreme.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The Vedas ( samhita )=\r\n do not proclaim these sectarian ideas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Another matter is, only when=\r\n one repent so \n&gt; &gt;deeply and actively involve wealfare of others, \n&gt; &gt;ther=\r\ne is real need for Universe to preserve his life even his karma be so evil.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;What power of curse normal human beings have, be \n&gt; &gt;they mothers, =\r\nfathers, etc, who have no \n&gt; &gt;vak-siddhi at all. Pitri tarpana and all othe=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt;false dogma which teaches we can do something \n&gt; &gt;for the dead is con=\r\ntrary to the Vedas ( samhita \n&gt; &gt;only. brahmana and other parts do not cons=\r\ntitute the Vedas ).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;If someone can donate money to copulating and \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;glutton pujari of mandir can the dead be escaope \n&gt; &gt;from damnation? This=\r\n is Mayavadi teaching which \n&gt; &gt;is most prevalent in buddhist nations.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;Of all religions, nothing is so devastating to \n&gt; &gt;human spirit but the =\r\nbudhism. Mohammedanism is \n&gt; &gt;much better than nihilistic philosophy.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;Sans Dieu, pas spiritualite ( a word of great Quebecois devotee of Krsna =\r\n)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;So, what I am finding is, many physically living \n&gt; &gt;gurus of well=\r\n known have some questionable practice..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I was greatly attached to a=\r\n female guru from \n&gt; &gt;South India who does Jagadyatra...

This is a simple procedure that \ntakes less than an hour and do=\r\n-able on a daily or weekly basis. I do a one-hour \nhomam everyday and can t=\r\nell you based on my own experience that a daily homam is \ngreat for spiritu=\r\nal sadhana. When bhootaagni burning in sookshma sareera is \nweak, nadis hav=\r\ne impurities and energy flow has obstructions, then most other \nsadhanas yo=\r\nu may be doing will not yield much result. Homam as a sadhana is a \nvery ef=\r\nfective in increasing bhootaagni, purifying nadis and removing \nobstruction=\r\ns to energy flow. If one is already a realized soul like Buddha, \nhomam may=\r\n be unnecessary. But, for the confused souls of Kali Yuga, it is a very \nef=\r\nfective method. Just like with any sadhana, regularity increases effect in =\r\n\nhomam too. I encourage people interested in the Vedic path to make a small=\r\n homam \n(one hour or half hour or atleast 15 min) a part of their daily spi=\r\nritual \nsadhana. After doing it for a few months, you will realize that it =\r\nwill make all \nyour other sadhanas (such as japam) much more effective.&lt;/FO=\r\nNT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Those of you who are more learned must forgive me \nif =\r\nyou find mistakes in what I am teaching.

There &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;isnonly one God and men cal=\r\nl that one by \nmany &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;names which is man&#39;s weakness, and not tha=\r\nt of god.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To my knowledge, as learned from my guru, God i=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;&gt; indeed one \nbut manifested variously.&nbsp; For the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sak=\r\ne of some very important \nuniversal functions, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; some of the jivas p=\r\nlay important roles, such as \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Brahma in creation, Indra in protect=\r\nion, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; etc.&nbsp; These \njivas are described in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bhagava=\r\nd-gita as &quot;Devas,&quot; and are definitely \na &lt;BR&gt;&gt; distinction that God, Sri=\r\n Krsna makes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Himself.&nbsp; Do you \nrecall the verse from &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Bhagavad-gita, &quot;Devan deva-yajo yanti, mad bhakta \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; yanti mam api,=\r\n&quot; or &quot;Those who worship the devas &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (demigods) go \nto the planets of=\r\n the demigods &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (after death), whereas those who worship \nMe, come &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; to Me.&quot;? So the concept of God and demigod &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (almighty, \nand=\r\n His empowered parts and parcels) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is not something of a cult \nthin=\r\nking, but rather &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that of the Lord Himself.&nbsp; But you know this=\r\n, \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; don&#39;t you, and am I not preaching to the choir here?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; \nSo far as many names of God, yes there are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; infinite names,=\r\n and these \nare mentioned in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; various scriptures to describe but a =\r\nminute &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nfraction of His immense potencies and Lilas.&nbsp; Why &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; is the awareness \nof various names of God &lt;BR&gt;&gt; indicative of man&#39;=\r\ns weakness?&nbsp; Further, in \nISKCON &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the infinite names of God as=\r\n described in various &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nscriptures are known, recited, and worshipp=\r\ned, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; yet indeed the \ndistinction between God and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; demigod i=\r\ns taught as well.&nbsp; Where did \nyou get the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; idea that ISKCON de=\r\nvotees only knew or worshipped one or \ntwo names of God?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;Why do you hate ISKCON? I have heard one \nelder &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;sadhu telli=\r\nng that God sends you to be born in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;the lands of those you fi=\r\nght against, in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;religion of those \nyou hate, in the houses=\r\n of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;those who have a debt to repay to you!!! \nI am &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;sure you don&#39;t want to be reborn as an ISKCON &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;member nor as=\r\n a buddhist. So my humble &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;submission is that you \nshould love =\r\nISKCON and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;love Buddhists, then you can stay away from \nthem f=\r\norever!!!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If I had the chance to take birth a million \ntim=\r\nes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; as a member of ISKCON, I would think myself as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the mos=\r\nt \nfortunate person, as ISKCON was the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; creation of His Divine Grac=\r\ne A.C. \nBhaktivedanta &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Swami Prabhupada, perhaps the greatest saint=\r\n to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nwalk the face of the earth in the 20th &lt;BR&gt;&gt; century.&nbsp=\r\n; Believe me when I \nsay this:&nbsp; had he not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; come with his tire=\r\nless effort to implant \nSanatana &lt;BR&gt;&gt; dharma and Vedic knowledge within=\r\n the minds of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; all \nthose outside of India, then it is doubtful &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; that anyone outside of \nIndia would even have &lt;BR&gt;&gt; heard of the V=\r\nedas, what to speak of \nJyotish.&nbsp; So &lt;BR&gt;&gt; far as the misgivings or=\r\n transgressions of some \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of my godbrothers are concerned, each and=\r\n every &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one of them \nwill be accountable for the results &lt;BR&gt;&gt; o=\r\nf their actions.&nbsp; Those who \nfollow the teachings &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of the Gaud=\r\niya Vaishnava parampara strictly, will \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; attain the highest moksa, =\r\nand there is no doubt &lt;BR&gt;&gt; about \nthis.&nbsp; So instead of elaborating=\r\n on the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sins of some fallen \ndisciples, and making this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhe epitaph of the society called ISKCON, \nmaybe &lt;BR&gt;&gt;

All entities are under &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;Navagraha&nbsp; ( at leaset&nbsp;=\r\n in our Solar Systm ). &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;So, if \nsome people have Shani dosha, i=\r\nt is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;understandable that they must \nfeed crows or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;serve old or homeless, black dogs, etc, since \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;all entities a=\r\nre united in energy level ( Unified Field Theory \n).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;But what I really have question is, that by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;chanting Navag=\r\nraha mantra or going up the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;mountain in bear \nfoot, which actu=\r\nally do not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;remedy any beings&#39; suffering, that \nsomehow our pa=\r\nst eveil deeds are nullified.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;This common \ntheorem=\r\n propagated by Hindu &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;astrologers have not answer the Law of \nC=\r\nause and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Effect. Suppose someone killes others for money. &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;Then in next or immidiate life, he must suffere poverty and viole=\r\nnt \ndeath.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;How, by supplicating deities which do n=\r\not have \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;any authority to bend the Law of CAUSE AND &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt;EFFECT \nwhich even God cannot do, mitigate our sufffering.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;In \nother words, if we repent and do great works &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;t=\r\no help and heal all \nbeings around us, our life &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;become worthy =\r\nand&nbsp; necessary for \nthe existence.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;But many s=\r\nelfish men such as some fool \nwho ask &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;for a mantra for beauty =\r\nwhich is abslultely &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;childish ( in this forum ), believes by m=\r\numbling &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;quasi Sanskrit \nwords ( Sanskrit is very accurate &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;language and must be enunciated \nproperly &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;)&nbsp; adv=\r\nocates Navagraha mantras and other &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;concocted works of post Ma=\r\nhabharata Hinduims.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;I for \nexample chanted certain=\r\n Navagraha mantra &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;from morning to sunset \nwithout food, drink =\r\nand &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;toilet, compleated the numbers required, \nNothing happened=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;My Tamil Brahmin friend ( real \nbrahmin by birth=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;and qualification and the works of charity ) \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;al=\r\nso know many mantras and tested, but popular &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;Navagraha tantri=\r\nk mantras did not work ).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;I find, \nthat the puja b=\r\ny proxy advocated by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;HIndus and Buddhists, Roman \ncatholics ha=\r\nve &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;fundamentally selfish. One&#39;s own tapas is the \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;key to lessen the karmic retribution, not some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;paid \npujari w=\r\nho have no interest nor compassion &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;for unknown men who send \nm=\r\noney from somewhere.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;I believe there are genuine \n=\r\nUpaya. The best of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;all is to help children, women, animals and=\r\n \nhandicapped.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;But theere is no such remedies chan=\r\nting \nmantras &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;or going on to some mountain in India...not in &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;the Vedas, BPHS and other ancient works of sages.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;I \nthink Kali yuga, we all seek easy remediy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;Indeed the \nqualified Vedic astrologers are vicar &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;of =\r\nMahakala; they can discern \nlife and death &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;matter. But how few=\r\n are those...I think we can count \nthose in our hands.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Another fundamental \nproblem for praying to particular de=\r\nity is this:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;Navagraha have been entrusted to exe=\r\ncute the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;dispensation of \nkarma. What authority some gods &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;or goddesses have to override \nNavagraha?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;Bringing and quoting puranas cannot stand a \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;logical argument=\r\n. Saiva, Vaishnava, Shakta all &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;have \ntheir supreme boooks whic=\r\nh were written by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;their co-religioninsts \nwho proclaims that t=\r\nheir god is Supreme.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;The Vedas ( \nsamhita ) do not=\r\n proclaim these sectarian ideas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;Another matter i=\r\ns, only when one repent so &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;deeply and actively \ninvolve wealfa=\r\nre of others, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;there is real need for Universe to \npreserve his=\r\n life even his karma be so evil.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;What power \nof cu=\r\nrse normal human beings have, be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;they mothers, fathers, etc, \n=\r\nwho have no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;vak-siddhi at all. Pitri tarpana and all other &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;false dogma which teaches we can do something &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;for t=\r\nhe dead is \ncontrary to the Vedas ( samhita &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;only. brahmana and=\r\n other parts do \nnot constitute the Vedas ).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;If so=\r\nmeone can donate money \nto copulating and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;glutton pujari of ma=\r\nndir can the dead be escaope \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;from damnation? This is Mayavadi=\r\n teaching which &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;is \nmost prevalent in buddhist nations.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Of all religions, \nnothing is so devastating to &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;human spirit but the budhism. \nMohammedanism is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;much bett=\r\ner than nihilistic philosophy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Sans Dieu, pas spi=\r\nritualite ( a word of great Quebecois devotee \nof Krsna )&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;So, what I am finding is, many physically \nliving &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;guru=\r\ns of well known have some questionable \npractice..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n;I was greatly attached to a female guru from \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;South India who=\r\n does Jagadyatra... But her &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;organisation starts more and more=\r\n online &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;puja,,,done by some \npujari far away for money...&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Whan an American caucasian \nyouth of 30s who is &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt;not even svami started conduct navagraha puja \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;and homa=\r\n ( ganapati homa , etc ) in the Evil &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Empire, I \nwas devastated=\r\n... Why this guru who is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;no doubt Kaliavatar allow \nher organi=\r\nsation do such buddhistic practicves...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Many \nISKC=\r\nON gurus absconded with money and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;women, abused \nchuildren...d=\r\nocumented facts. So &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;is lier Mukrtananda of SYDA, so is \nRajnee=\r\nsh, so &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;is Ravishanker, Maheshi Yogi,,,,all shame of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;India who desecrated the Aryavarta by their evil ways...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt;In other pantehons stands Bhagavan Ramakrsna, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;Bha=\r\ngavan Shiridi Baba, Bhagavan Sathya Sai &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Baba......and \ncountle=\r\nss unknown but genuine saints of Aryavarta....&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;Th=\r\ne sincere ex-Indian born as foreigners is this:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;h=\r\now to find a Sadguru and can settle and survive ( economically ) in \nIndia.=\r\n..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Despite of evil Western and Mohamedan \ninfluenc=\r\ne, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;still in India genuine saints lives, and innocent and \nlovi=\r\nng Indians live...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;So, knowing I have only only 2 =\r\n\nand half years &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;before coming Sade Sathi, I must find a Sadgur=\r\nu \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;who is not inudated by foreign devotees ( which &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;makes \nsadhana impossible since they come to India as tourists ).&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;I must find in colder climate, such as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;Chan=\r\ndigah, Simla, etc, a \nsadguru who can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;really&nbsp; guide me on=\r\ne on one in many \nPuja-viddhi....&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;But my fear is, =\r\nas my chart indicates, \nthat may &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;be Lord Saturn is luring me i=\r\nnto India so that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;He can totally annihilate me by ganged up b=\r\ny &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;dacoits attack ( \nas per my chart ).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;Death is salvation to me.
