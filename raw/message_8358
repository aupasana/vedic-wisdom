Sound advice no doubt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately Du=\r\nrga is partial to some of her children it seems, and not all of us are bles=\r\nsed with the intense desire to chant as you seem to be.

The Atman is sexless, but the Atman in female form has been treated w=\r\norse than the Atman in male form over the centuries...even today it is bein=\r\ng murdered in the womb (female foeticide), raped, burnt in Sati etc etc. Ye=\r\ns yes it is deathless etc, but while in this ignorant state, it still suffe=\r\nrs in the form of women. I hasten to add that I am no feminist but right no=\r\nw, I&#39;m furious with Durga. How outrageous that for centuries, and even toda=\r\ny, women were not allowed to be initiated into the Gayatri (which is to the=\r\n Goddess). Why aren&#39;t there more women saints? The ratio of female to male =\r\nsaints is probably 1:10. It&#39;s bloody disheartening. And what is the point o=\r\nf covering us with ignorance (it&#39;s her fault, she is the Avidya Maya), and =\r\nthen yelling at us for not being wise (as she does in all the scriptures). =\r\nIf she wants to save us, she will have to create in us the desire\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  to=\r\n do japa or whatever. I wash my hands of the whole thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; So d=\r\non&#39;t tell us to chant, tell her to tell us to chant. Like she told you to. =\r\nIt&#39;s not our fault.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ok rant over. I&#39;m going to control my temp=\r\ner and do some Om Namo Narayanaya repetition now. Who knows when it&#39;s time =\r\nfor the cremation ground? You did it for a select few, but not for the rest=\r\n of us millions- Damn you Durga. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aparna\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
