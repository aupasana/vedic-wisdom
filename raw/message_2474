What this namboodiri did is the correct way.\n \nVisualize the external f=\r\nire as your internal fire and worship it. Then offerings in it will kindle =\r\nyour internal fire and streamline it, depending on how strong your identifi=\r\ncation is (it will get stronger with practice). If anyone handles that exte=\r\nrnal fire or makes offerings in it, some karmas will be submitted by that p=\r\nerson to your internal fire for burning. This intermingling of karmas can b=\r\ne allowed for people whose karmas are anyway intertwined, like husband and =\r\nwife or parents and children. Of course, you can also take on karmas from t=\r\nhe entire world if you are ready and willing to face their consequences, bu=\r\nt a person with a strong individualized ego should limit the karmas one fac=\r\nes and work on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle, it may=\r\n be possible to take on more karmas and face their consequences. After all,=\r\n if you start plucking leaves, flowers and fruits from a small plant, it wi=\r\nll die. If you guard it and let it grow very big, it can give flowers and f=\r\nruits to many more people. So, until you become very pure, keep working to =\r\nburn your karmas and free yourself from the vaasanas (mental conditioning) =\r\ncaused by them.\n \nBut some people use fire in the same way an idol is used.=\r\n They allow anyone to start the fire in their homam, handle the fire and ma=\r\nke offerings in it etc. If one who strongly identifies one&#39;s internal fire =\r\nwith external fire does such things, it can be disastrous. However, luckily=\r\n, most people who follow this approach do not understand much about fire an=\r\nd do not have a strong identification with the fire. So, fire is practicall=\r\ny like an idol for them and they do not benefit from fire as much as one ca=\r\nn. Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or making offerings into you =\r\nfire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at worst.\n \nThe best approac=\r\nh is: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. Only you make offerings =\r\nin it. In your mind, identify it with your own internal fire (bhootaagni) t=\r\nhat burns in the subtle body. If you do this for a while, a strong bond is =\r\nindeed formed. Without your knowledge, the internal fire will become strong=\r\n and burn various vaasanas.\n \n(2) There are different methods for beeja, sh=\r\nakti and keelakam, though anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usually standard.=\r\n Do not worry about these things and do what you are used to or what you ar=\r\ne more attracted to.\n \nAs I said many times, these nyaasas are just formali=\r\nty for most people. Placing a letter in a particular body part has a higher=\r\n significance than just tough a part and saying it. Visualizing a specific =\r\nbody part vibrating with a specific sound is possible only after one makes =\r\nsufficient progress in purifying one&#39;s subtle perception. So there is no po=\r\nint in discussing what is essentially a formality. I can tell you that this=\r\n will not block you.\n \n(3) They should be shown in the video. If you cannot=\r\n get them, please feel free to just say it and not show any mudra. It will =\r\nnot block you.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) =\r\nwebsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n--------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n \n---- gisundar &lt;gisundar@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt;=\r\n Namaskarams Narasimhaji,\n&gt; I am planning to start doing regular Ganapathi =\r\nhomam (once in a week)starting this Sunday.

I am a Palaghat Iyer and on other ocassions =\r\nwhen we had a namboothiri perform the homam he would light the homam fire h=\r\nimself. \n&gt; My question is whether I can ask my wife to start the homam fire=\r\n or do it myself ?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) during the anganyasa and karanysa specifically t=\r\nhe glaam beejam , gleem shaktih , glaum kilakam mantraas/mudras , I used to=\r\n touch the heart , then right and left breasts respectively whereas in the =\r\nvideo you have shown it to be heart , navel and below respctively. Is the  =\r\nbeejam , shakthih and kilakam mudras /mantrams differnet for each diety ? \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) There are 4 more avhana mudras for  suprIto bhava,suprasanno bhava,=\r\n varado bhava, sarvAbhIshTaprado bhava.

Doing a one-off homa=\r\nm that takes 3-4 \n&gt; &gt; hours is far less useful than doing a 30 min homam ev=\r\neryday. It is like \n&gt; &gt; fasting everyday and eating a 30-course meal once e=\r\nvery few months vs eating \n&gt; &gt; dal and rice everyday.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However, you=\r\nr request is good and I will try to create a long procedure \n&gt; &gt; manual atl=\r\neast for Mahaganapathi homam.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (2) I have all of them in mind. Puru=\r\nsha sookta homam is the simplest homam \n&gt; &gt; and very useful for spiritual p=\r\nrogress. I do have that in mind. Sudarsana \n&gt; &gt; homam can also be done on a=\r\n regular basis quickly. But navagraha homam is \n&gt; &gt; more time-consuming.
