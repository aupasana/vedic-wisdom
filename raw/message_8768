I b=\r\nelieve that the roots of homam/havan movement, which is done by many thousa=\r\nnds today inspired by this list and the manual written by you, traceback to=\r\n that great yogi. obviously, the person with whom you are intouch with, mus=\r\nt have some valuable knowledge experience related to Agni Sadhana.\n\nwith th=\r\nis background, I have sincere request to you. for the clarifications of man=\r\ny, is it possible to ask for his views about this ratio of numbers of Mantr=\r\na in Ahuti and Japa and Tarpana in detail.\n\nSincerely,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;ashutosh.srikanth&quot; &lt;ashutosh.srikanth@...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; My pranams to all.\n&gt; I have been performing weekly havan for more than=\r\n a year and half.\n&gt; I want to point out certain things related to havan so =\r\nthat it can be done as per shastra by others too.\n&gt; I am using a conversati=\r\non that in fact took place to bring out these relevant points.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sometim=\r\ne back there was informal &quot;prashNa&quot; session whose summary I am presenting b=\r\nelow: \n&gt; \n&gt; [South Indians might be familiar with similar &quot;ashTamangala pra=\r\nshNa&quot; conducted in temples when something goes wrong - called as dosha.]\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a dosha... Hmm... let me see... Hmm=\r\n.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Agni karya at your home re=\r\ngularly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Yes (I was actually very surprised by this pointed qu=\r\nestion because I had not told anybody about the havan I did at home)\n&gt; \n&gt; P=\r\nrashNa conductor: There are certain errors in the agni karya you are doing.=\r\n You seem to be using dry samith materials. And your ahuti does not seem to=\r\n be right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds).\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa con=\r\nductor: You should mix that with atleast a little bit of ghee before giving=\r\n it as ahuti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha in my ahuti apart from=\r\n that?\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you do required Japa before giving ahutis=\r\n? And do you do the ahuti with the same mantra that you use for your regula=\r\nr japa?\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is there a pre-requisite like =\r\nthat? No I dont do any pre-defined set of japa?\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Yes=\r\n. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 recita=\r\ntion of a mantra via meditation, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) or at=\r\n least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantra in =\r\nmeditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Doesnt that only=\r\n apply to purascharaNa (based on what I read in Aghore book - as everybody =\r\nin this group is already familiar with that book series)\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa condu=\r\nctor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doesnt m=\r\natter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow it str=\r\nictly.\n&gt; \n&gt; The conversation went onto several other things. Subsequently I=\r\n went on to get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished seer and reciting that =\r\nmantra and also using the same mantra for my ahuti in homam as per the abov=\r\ne mentioned ratio only and have been very happy with my spiritual progress =\r\nsince. \n&gt; \n&gt; Whether all the homa-practioners in this group agree with me o=\r\nr not, I just wanted to point this out to all requesting everybody to perfo=\r\nrm at least 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to get the &quot;qualific=\r\nation&quot; for the ahuti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Ashutosh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
