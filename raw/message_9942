Tough to avoid..\n=C2=A0\nHowever, if you are getting a lot of smoke contin=\r\nuously after fire goes off, it means there is some material that could not =\r\nburn well. One possibility is that a portion of poornahuti at the bottom (o=\r\nr some previously offered material covered by poornahuti) could not burn we=\r\nll. In general, smoke is a sign that fire tried to reach/consume some parts=\r\n but was unable to.\n=C2=A0\nWhen offering things, offer things small enough =\r\n(depending on the size of fire) so that they burn fully.\n=C2=A0\nSecondly, t=\r\nhings offered should have enough air circulation. Even if I offer small ite=\r\nms, things stuck in the middle of a big pile do not get enough oxygen to bu=\r\nrn. Offering materials at a reasonable pace and spreading them throughout t=\r\nhe firepit, may help.\n\n=C2=A0\nEven firewood logs will burn better and brigh=\r\nter if they have air circulation. If a wood log touches fire pit bottom/wal=\r\nls only at its two edges and is suspended in air elsewhere, it will burn be=\r\ntter because of air supply. Otherwise, edges of the portion without air cir=\r\nculation may keep releasing smoke.\n\n=C2=A0\nAs things burn, if you turn them=\r\n around or mix them up so that everything burns well (tongs may be used), i=\r\nt can help you burn everything well.\n=C2=A0When I offer poornahuti (a whole=\r\n dry coconut) in my homam, I pre-arrange burnt wood coals in a structure th=\r\nat has nice air flow. When coconut is placed atop those coals, it does not =\r\ncrush everything (in which case, some stuff under coconut or bottom of coco=\r\nnut may burn fully by the time fire goes off), but gets suspended on the co=\r\nals with most of the coconut getting air circulation. It burns nicely from =\r\nall sides, including the bottom. If this is not possible, you may want to t=\r\nurn the poornahuti around in the middle (while there is still fire) and per=\r\nhaps change its position/place (and offer a little more ghee then). In my c=\r\nase, I go into one-hour japam after poornahuti and do not want to stop medi=\r\ntation in the middle to take care of poornahuti. So I arrange things nicely=\r\n beforehand. The way it is placed, it just burns completely and everything =\r\noffered before also burns completely, by the time fire goes off by itself.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nIt is a matter of understanding the dynamics of how fire and oxygen =\r\ninteract to burn materials and when smoke comes. One should try to learn fr=\r\nom experience and draw common sense lessons.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nRegarding shreema.org recommendation (&quot;We extinguish the fire during the Pu=\r\nrnahuti. Pour milk over the burning coals&quot;, &quot;Milk stands for the ocean of c=\r\nonsciousness =E2=80=93 pure, white, the absence of all colors, attitudes. A=\r\nfter the fire has purified all impurities, it \nis extinguished with pure co=\r\nnsciousness.&quot;):\n=C2=A0\nSuch a practice may exist in some traditions. In my =\r\nhumble, but firm, opinion, this practice is based on ignorance and worth ig=\r\nnoring. When discussing this specific recommendation and the quotes above, =\r\nDr Svoboda wrote to me, &quot;I definitely do not endorse quenching homa at its =\r\nend. Neither did Vimalananda&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nI believe Shree Ma and Swamiji have t=\r\nheir hearts in the right place and doing good dharmik work. I do admire the=\r\nir work and wish them well. But this advice of theirs is simply nonsensical=\r\n. First of all, milk is not a symbol of pure consciousness. Milk has a spec=\r\nific taste and color (sweetness and white) and not really a symbol of guna-=\r\nless pure consciousness. Secondly, fire is the symbol of Divinity and you s=\r\nhould let it process your offerings completely and give the results in due =\r\ntime.You can&#39;t try to force things. Pouring milk under the pretext that it =\r\nis &quot;pure consciousness&quot; is akin to doing some sadhana and pretending that y=\r\nou are now in samadhi. That only results in delusions and theatrics and not=\r\n real samadhi. If you want real samadhi, you need true surrender. True surr=\r\nender requires infinite patience.\n=C2=A0\nNever ever extinguish homam fire. =\r\nIf there are practical limitations on when fire should go off (e.g. you nee=\r\nd to leave), maintain a small enough fire and offer poornahuti early enough=\r\n, so that fire goes off by itself by the needed time. But you can&#39;t forcefu=\r\nlly extinguish it when fire is still burning.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nSomeone I know does homam outside and leaves for work. Though fire goes off=\r\n before he leaves, there will be red coals for a much longer time. Wind can=\r\n make small coals fly off and so, for safety, he covers the homa kundam wit=\r\nh a tightly wrapped aluminum foil. That also is like extinguishing fire bec=\r\nause you are turning off oxygen supply that can help fire (resident in red =\r\ncoals) to burn things further and consume them. If you make 2 small holes i=\r\nn the foil cover to keep oxygen flowing, with holes being small enough that=\r\n solid things cannot fly off through them, it is safe and, at the same time=\r\n, allows Agni to consume as much as he wants! Once you invite Agni, offer o=\r\nnly as much as you want Him to consume, but do let Him consume all of it. D=\r\non&#39;t stop him forcefully in the middle.\n\n=C2=A0*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;Also=\r\n I am keen in knowing , does attending havan also burn karmas ...I mean not=\r\n giving any aahuti but just attending havan&gt;&gt;\n\nAs per &quot;Parasara Madhaveeyam=\r\n&quot; (commentary on Parasara Smriti - authority for this age - by celebrated M=\r\nadhavacharya, brother of Sayanacharya who wrote the celebrated commentaries=\r\n on Veda), a ritual performed by oneself is 1,000,000 times more powerful t=\r\nhan a ritual performed in one&#39;s name by a priest. Then sitting near a ritua=\r\nl performed by someone else is far less effective than doing a ritual by on=\r\neself. Having said that, it may still be far more effective than most other=\r\n activities we engage in!!!\n=C2=A0\nThe bottomline, however, is the internal=\r\n purity and concentration. If one is pure enough and concentrates well, one=\r\n can offer things to any external fire or even internal fire. If all one ca=\r\nn do is to sit at someone else&#39;s homam or pooja, one should go ahead and do=\r\n it. If all one can do is to meditate where one is, one should go ahead and=\r\n do it. But, if one has a chance to do a homam, one may consider doing it.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nIf you don&#39;t have a group to chant mantras with but want to, chant a=\r\nlone but imagine that there are other people around you who are chanting. W=\r\nho knows, oneday you may really be surrounded by many chanting people..\n\n=\r\n=C2=A0Best regards,\n\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt;_______________________=\r\n_________\n&gt; From: &quot;cuteyashica@...&quot; &lt;cuteyashica@...&gt;\n&gt;To: vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;Sent: Sunday, December 8, 2013 2:13 AM\n&gt;Subject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Smoke after poornahuti - should I pour milk\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 =\r\n\n&gt;Om gurave Namah ..\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Namastey All Learned Members =C2=A0!!!\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Pleas=\r\ne guide about following issue :\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Nowdays , the weather is quite cold ..=\r\n..and when I am performing havan ..after poornahuti ....the dry coconut is =\r\ngenerating a lot of smoke ....after burning up there is lot of smoke genera=\r\nted .Even though , I place it in my balcony =C2=A0but the people living in =\r\nflat above ours , they have issue with =C2=A0the smoke ..\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;On Shree Maa=\r\n , website , I have read that they pour glass of milk after giving poornahu=\r\nti on burning parts ...But in PVR ji manuals ....we have not read about it =\r\n....Please let me know what to do subside that smoke ...I feel disheartened=\r\n as whenever I start doing havan , I feel so many obstacles .....or can I u=\r\nse something else instead of dry coconut as poornahuti ...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Also I am k=\r\neen in knowing , does attending havan also burn karmas ...I mean not giving=\r\n any aahuti but just attending havan ....\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Also , if anyone is aware of=\r\n any ashram , where one can go and stay for some days and perform havan dai=\r\nly ..Like I saw maharishi mahesh yogi ashram in bijauri where group of peop=\r\nle perform havan daily ..But the cost of staying there is quite high ...I r=\r\neally want to chant mantras with group of people ..But I am not able to fin=\r\nd such a place ...\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Regards and Thanks\n&gt;\r\n--61789334-1724894835-1386523677=:36945\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Namaste &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=\r\n&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;cuteyashica&lt;/font&gt; ji,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: arial,helveti=\r\nca,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13.3333px; f=\r\nont-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font=\r\n-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;When there is fire, there will be some smoke.

In my humble, but firm, opinion, this practice is base=\r\nd on ignorance and worth ignoring. When discussing this specific recommenda=\r\ntion and the quotes above, Dr Svoboda wrote to me, &quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I de=\r\nfinitely do not endorse quenching homa at its end. Neither did Vimalananda&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&quot;.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13.3333p=\r\nx; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; =\r\nfont-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0=\r\n, 0); font-size: 13.3333px;\n font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; backg=\r\nround-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;I believe Shree Ma and=\r\n Swamiji have their hearts in the right place and doing good dharmik work. =\r\nI do admire their work and wish them well. But this advice of theirs is sim=\r\nply nonsensical. First of all, milk is not a symbol of pure consciousness. =\r\nMilk has a specific taste and color (sweetness and white) and not really a =\r\nsymbol of guna-less pure consciousness. Secondly, fire is the symbol of Div=\r\ninity and you should let it process your offerings completely and give the =\r\nresults in due time. You can&#39;t try to force things. Pouring milk under the =\r\npretext that it is &quot;pure consciousness&quot; is akin to doing some sadhana and p=\r\nretending that you are now in samadhi. That only results in delusions and t=\r\nheatrics and not real samadhi. If you want real samadhi, you need true surr=\r\nender. True surrender requires infinite patience.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D=\r\n&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);\n font-size: 13.3333px; font-family: arial,helvetica,s=\r\nans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13.3333px; font-=\r\nfamily: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-sty=\r\nle: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Never ever extinguish homam fire. If there are practical=\r\n limitations on when fire should go off (e.g. you need to leave), maintain =\r\na small enough fire and offer poornahuti early enough, so that fire goes of=\r\nf by itself by the needed time.

Though fire goes off before he leaves, there will be red coals for =\r\na much longer time. Wind can make small coals fly off and so, for safety, h=\r\ne covers the homa kundam with a tightly wrapped aluminum foil. That also is=\r\n like extinguishing fire because you are turning off oxygen supply that can=\r\n help fire (resident in red coals) to burn things further and consume them.=\r\n If you make 2 small holes in the foil cover to\n keep oxygen flowing, with =\r\nholes being small enough that solid things cannot fly off through them, it =\r\nis safe and, at the same time, allows Agni to consume as much as he wants! =\r\nOnce you invite Agni, offer only as much as you want Him to consume, but do=\r\n let Him consume all of it.

Then sitting near a ritual performed by so=\r\nmeone else is far less effective than doing a ritual by oneself. Having sai=\r\nd that, it may still be far more effective than most other activities we en=\r\ngage in!!!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The bottomline, however, is the internal purity and=\r\n concentration. If one is pure enough and concentrates well, one can offer =\r\nthings to any external fire or even &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;internal fire. If all one =\r\ncan do is to sit at someone else&#39;s homam or pooja, one should go ahead and =\r\ndo it. If all one can do is to meditate where one is, one should go ahead a=\r\nnd do it. But, if one has a chance to do a homam, one may consider doing it=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If you don&#39;t have a group to chant mantras with but want to,=\r\n chant alone but imagine that there are other people around you who are cha=\r\nnting.
