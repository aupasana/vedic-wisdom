Someone=\r\n sent me a few snippets from an \n          interview posted on her website.=\r\n Please see below.\n\n          It is interesting that she considers Ramakris=\r\nhna Paramahamsa as her guru. It \n          is interesting that Ramakrishna =\r\ntold her she had to &quot;do fire ceremonies and \n          show what is truth&quot; =\r\nand &quot;at that time the whole world will be peace&quot;. This \n          is simila=\r\nr to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appeared to \n         =\r\n him during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.\n\n          She told him that man=\r\ny people are and will be born who will perform a short \n          fire ritu=\r\nal on a regular basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in the \n        =\r\n  world and also make quick spiritual progress individually in that process=\r\n. \n          Shree Maa&#39;s statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along=\r\n similar \n          lines.\n\n          My guru was also told by Mother that =\r\na few centres of regular Chandi homam \n          should be established arou=\r\nnd the world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times a \n          day. These pl=\r\naces do not need to be near any temples or famous places and \n          can=\r\n be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, there is no \n =\r\n         need to offer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with bare m=\r\ninimum \n          offerings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times=\r\n everyday. When a \n          few such centres are established, it will appa=\r\nrently lead to a chain of \n          events that will help re-establish san=\r\natana dharma.\n\n          Though not 3 times a day, these people have done a=\r\n Chandi homam everyday for \n          3 years in the same place and finishe=\r\nd 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! \n          It is the sadhana and puri=\r\nty of sadhakas that creates energy and brings \n          deities to a place=\r\n. While several ancient temples are without any divine \n          presence =\r\nthese days, new places of divine presence may be created by pure \n         =\r\n souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the world.\n\n =\r\n         As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam dur=\r\ning which \n          Mother appeared and gave instructions to my guru on sp=\r\nreading homam was \n          taken on Ramakrishna&#39; s birth anniversary and =\r\nthe time of sankalpa was within \n          a few minutes from the actual Ti=\r\nthi Pravesha time of the birth anniversary. \n          All of this was a co=\r\nincidence and we were unaware of this significance when \n          we decid=\r\ned the muhurta. It is interesting to know that Ramakrishna did \n          m=\r\nention fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and that his words are \n   =\r\n       similar to the words of Mother.\n\n          Best regards,\n          N=\r\narasimha\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ -\n          Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.o=\r\nrg/ homam\n          Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org/ tarpana\n          Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic=\r\n- wisdom\n          Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comc=\r\nast. net\n          Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rol=\r\noger.org\n          Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan =\r\nnath.org\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ - \n\n          &gt;

Someone \n          sent me a few snippets from an &lt;BR&gt;interview p=\r\nosted on her website. \n          Please see below.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is interesting=\r\n that she considers \n          Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as her guru. It &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nis interesting that \n          Ramakrishna told her she had to &quot;do fire cer=\r\nemonies and &lt;BR&gt;show what \n          is truth&quot; and &quot;at that time the whole =\r\nworld will be peace&quot;. This \n          &lt;BR&gt;is similar to what my guru was to=\r\nld by Divine Mother when she \n          appeared to &lt;BR&gt;him during Shata Ch=\r\nandi homam at Chennai.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;She \n          told him that many people are =\r\nand will be born who will perform a \n          short &lt;BR&gt;fire ritual on a r=\r\negular basis, establish sanatana dharma \n          and peace in the &lt;BR&gt;wor=\r\nld and also make quick spiritual progress \n          individually in that p=\r\nrocess. &lt;BR&gt;Shree Maa&#39;s statement about what \n          Ramakrishna told he=\r\nr is along similar &lt;BR&gt;lines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My guru was \n          also told by Mo=\r\nther that a few centres of regular Chandi homam \n          &lt;BR&gt;should be es=\r\ntablished around the world, where Chandi homam is done \n          3 times a=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;day. These places do not need to be near any temples or \n          fam=\r\nous places and &lt;BR&gt;can be anywhere. The ritual need not be \n          elabo=\r\nrate. For example, there is no &lt;BR&gt;need to offer silk sarees etc \n         =\r\n in fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum &lt;BR&gt;offerings is enough, \n     =\r\n     but it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a &lt;BR&gt;few such \n  =\r\n        centres are established, it will apparently lead to a chain of \n   =\r\n       &lt;BR&gt;events that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thoug=\r\nh \n          not 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam every=\r\nday for \n          &lt;BR&gt;3 years in the same place and finished 1000 such hom=\r\nas. That is \n          fantastic! &lt;BR&gt;It is the sadhana and purity of sadha=\r\nkas that creates \n          energy and brings &lt;BR&gt;deities to a place. While=\r\n several ancient \n          temples are without any divine &lt;BR&gt;presence the=\r\nse days, new places of \n          divine presence may be created by pure &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;souls engaged in selfless \n          sadhana for establishing dharma in t=\r\nhe world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As I mentioned \n          earlier, the sankalpa of the Sha=\r\nta Chandi homam during which \n          &lt;BR&gt;Mother appeared and gave instru=\r\nctions to my guru on spreading \n          homam was &lt;BR&gt;taken on Ramakrishn=\r\na&#39; s birth anniversary and the time \n          of sankalpa was within &lt;BR&gt;a=\r\n few minutes from the actual Tithi \n          Pravesha time of the birth an=\r\nniversary. &lt;BR&gt;All of this was a \n          coincidence and we were unaware=\r\n of this significance when &lt;BR&gt;we \n          decided the muhurta. It is int=\r\neresting to know that Ramakrishna did \n          &lt;BR&gt;mention fire ceremonie=\r\ns specifically to somebody and that his \n          words are &lt;BR&gt;similar to=\r\n the words of Mother.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best \n          regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;-----=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- \n          --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;D=\r\no a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.=\r\norg/homam&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri \n          Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnof=\r\nollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \n          tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituali=\r\nty: &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic-=\r\n wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \n          Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://ved=\r\nicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:/=\r\n/vedicastro. home.comcast. \n          net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Win=\r\ndows): &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_bla=\r\nnk \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jag=\r\nannath \n          Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.=\r\norg/&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan \n      =\r\n    nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- \n =\r\n         --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; She considers Shri Ramakrishna as her&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; \n          Master, has a small ashram here near the Bay Area&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Now \n          here is the very interesting part (snippets from her =\r\nwebsite&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          pasted for your benefit), from an interview foun=\r\nd here&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;http://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/taxonom=\r\ny_menu/54/86&quot; \n          target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.shreemaa=\r\n .org/drupal/ taxonomy_ \n          menu/54/86&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Shree Maa: \n          Ramakrishna, my Guru, was telling, &quot;You h=\r\nave to go now for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; our \n          country, and all other country, yo=\r\nu have to go do fire \n          ceremonies&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and show what is truth, =\r\nwhat is dignity, and at \n          that time the whole&lt;BR&gt;&gt; world will b=\r\ne peace.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &lt;/snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Her main discipl=\r\ne is Swami Satyananda \n          Saraswati (of American descent),&lt;BR&gt;&gt; t=\r\nhat same page describes his \n          background, how he met her and all t=\r\nhat;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; but another \n          interesting snippet in there:-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;At a time \n          when journeying throughout Middl=\r\ne Asia was arduous at best,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he \n          had traveled an unbeaten =\r\npath to India&#39;s interior where he \n          studied&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with a number =\r\nof gurus, coming to embrace the worship \n          of Chandi and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; th=\r\ne sacred fire ceremony, the yagya, as his \n          primary system of wors=\r\nhip&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and meditation, while undertaking \n          great austerities =\r\nin the process.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;They \n          undertook th=\r\ne Sahasra Chandi Yagya, a three year fire ceremony&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          and w=\r\norship of the Goddess, without setting foot outside from \n          the&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; humble temple grounds they established in Martinez, \n          Califor=\r\nnia.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n      &lt;/snip&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/=\r\nTD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0236_01C996D9.3A1B7F40--\r\n\n"}}
