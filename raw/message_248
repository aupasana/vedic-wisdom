If you look deeper Gnadhiji and Narshi Mehta \nare pole=\r\ns apart. Narsi Mehta was one of those few people who in the \npath of bhakti=\r\n had come to the stage of being able to percieve and \nuderstand the real ra=\r\nsa-lila of krishna. This happens at a VERY VERY \nVERY advanced stage. All t=\r\nhe nadis in the body get cleared beyond \nthe three gunas and then and only =\r\nthen the energy of the soul flows \nthrought them and rasa lila can be under=\r\nstood happening inside the \nbody. Someone who has reached this stage would =\r\nNEVER EVER in any \nbirth think of anything other than this stage. It is, th=\r\ney say, far \nbeyond anythin one can even remote imagine.\n\nGandhiji had a di=\r\nfferent purpose, and he was a different man \ncompletely from Narsi Mehta. H=\r\nis aim and focus of life was \nindependence struggle which he did fight for =\r\nin his own remarkable \nway. No doubt he was a terrific personality in terms=\r\n of the indian \nas well as the world politcan scenario. But he was not real=\r\nly a \nspiritual saint. Unlike Narsi Mehta who was a pure saint and nothing =\r\n\nelse. Both have their purpose in the scheme of things and both are \nequall=\r\ny worthy of respect. But one is not the other at all! No even \nin any birth=\r\ns. Never.\n\n\n\nIn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Utpal Pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@..=\r\n.&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Jyotishas & Spiritualists,\n&gt;    \n&gt;   One intresting thi=\r\nng i came to know about &#39;Mahatma Gandhi&#39;. I \nwas reading the autobiography =\r\nof a Yogi whose name is &#39;Yogeshwar&#39;. \nhe has witten his biography in Gujara=\r\nti language. name of the book \nis &quot;Prakash na panthe&quot;\n&gt;    \n&gt;   He has ment=\r\nioned in the book that once he was meditating. his \nconsciousness left the =\r\nbody and travelled to a place where there was \na small hut at the bank of a=\r\n river. one person was singing, in a \nvery beautiful voice. and suddenly Sh=\r\nri yogeshwar heard a loud voice \nwhich revealed that &quot;Narsinha Mehta had ta=\r\nken rebirth as Mahatma \nGandhi&quot;.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   to give a little background, Nar=\r\nsinha Mehta was a very revered \nSaint of Gujarat who had a great Bhakti for=\r\n Lord Krishna. it is said \nthat Krishna had taken complete responsibility o=\r\nf his Yogakshem and \nhad came to his rescue for 52 times.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Narsinh=\r\n Mehta has composed many Bhakti Git which is \ncalled &#39;Prabhatiya&#39; and his m=\r\nost famous one is &quot;Vaishnav jan to tene \nre kahiye....&quot; which, intrestingly=\r\n became famous worldwide becuase \nof Mahatma Gandhi.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   thought of s=\r\nharing this information with you all.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Best Regards,\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Utp=\r\nal\n&gt;    \n\n&gt; \n&gt;        \n&gt; ---------------------------------\n&gt; You rock.
