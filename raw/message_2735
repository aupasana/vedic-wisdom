My comments on that is:\n\n1.  I-n=\r\ness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta has no innate power to Control a=\r\nny other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.\n   Reason:\n   Soul is the only Truth =\r\nand controller, everything else has an unreal and derived existence. Thus, =\r\nall the 35 ideas co-ordinate with each other, and not control each other. \n=\r\n\n2. A new-born child or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sen=\r\nse-consciousness coherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derive=\r\nd from Manas, that coordinates the senses.\n   He has no Buddhi or discrimin=\r\nating faculty to interact with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what =\r\nto do - as you have proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to it=\r\ns own sense of I-ness, not due to Buddhi.\n\n   I hope this clarifies.\n\nRegar=\r\nds,\nNitish\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Out of the 19 or 35 attributes of individualiz=\r\ned consciousness, which one gives the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of c=\r\nourse, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosense or ego principle!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Is on=\r\ne&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of course not! If someo=\r\nne says &quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel offended or i=\r\nf someone says &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one may feel elated. O=\r\nne&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or praise, even t=\r\nhough nothing is being done to the physical body and only a name is being u=\r\nsed. When somebody calls one by name from distance (as opposed to patting o=\r\nn the physical body and calling), one&#39;s consciousness may still think &quot;I am=\r\n being called&quot; and one may turn towards the caller. As in these examples, o=\r\nne&#39;s I-ness does of course bind itself to more than a body.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Suppose o=\r\nne gets a dream while sleeping. One may have forgotten totally about the ph=\r\nysical body in the dream! One may think of something else as &quot;I&quot;. In dreams=\r\n, one may see oneself as a different body or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself, but=\r\n still one may have the sense that so and so thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So=\r\n, even when the mind is drawn away from the physical body, there is still a=\r\n notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or e=\r\ngo principle.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is =\r\nabsolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical bod=\r\ny.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-nes=\r\ns) because they do not have physical bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni d=\r\noes have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he did =\r\nnot have that I-ness, he would not do everything he does.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Moreover, t=\r\nhe 19 or 35 ideas of individualized consciousness do interact with each oth=\r\ner, whether we use the word &quot;control&quot; for some of those interactions or not=\r\n. For example, buddhi (intellectual/discriminating mind) judges various pas=\r\nt experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what =\r\nto do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes =\r\nthem do various things. My buddhi determined what to write and my manas tol=\r\nd my hands to type this and I ended up typing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Your point about &quot;what=\r\n exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totally out of place. The sense o=\r\nf I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the sensory-moto=\r\nr mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts of individualized consciou=\r\nsness and they play different roles while interacting with each other in di=\r\nfferent ways. Some of those interactions may be deemed to be controls.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;    Am not mixing up the terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; go in =\r\ndetails. Your understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this=\r\n up ?\n&gt;  \n&gt; One does not &quot;read up&quot; these things in a single place. There ar=\r\ne different abstractions and breakdowns of what happens in individualized c=\r\nonsciousness. There are several sources that speak of different aspects of =\r\nthis knowledge in slightly different terms. One will assimilate this knowle=\r\ndge better if one reads as many sources as possible and contemplates.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ta=\r\nrpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyo=\r\ntish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish softw=\r\nare (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: =\r\nhttp://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; |=\r\n| OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;    Please Ignore my previous-mail, =\r\nit was not completed - i will try to delete it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Am not mixing u=\r\np the terminologies, though my mail didn&#39;t go in details. Your understandin=\r\ng is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally=\r\n belong to the ideational or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome onl=\r\ny in the physical body (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (thos=\r\ne without a physical/astral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Aham=\r\nkara like we do.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. W=\r\nhen manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. Th=\r\nat sense of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individuali=\r\nzed consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    The=\r\nre is a fine line between the sense of I-ness attributed to the Individual =\r\nSoul and the sense of I-ness derived through the idea of Ahamkara. Even aft=\r\ner a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom =\r\nis not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), while it has already given up=\r\n the idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Individuality o=\r\nf a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;What ex=\r\nists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being one =\r\nof the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account for neither controls th=\r\ne rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, without requir=\r\ning another idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always interf=\r\nere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life-for=\r\nces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body are the =\r\nbasic causal forces and are not related as cause-effect to each other. Thus=\r\n, each is independent of the application of the sense of I-ness derived fro=\r\nm Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their functioni=\r\nng as well as existence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the=\r\n idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Buddhi =\r\nor Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work=\r\n upon that particular idea.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  But ego/ahamkaara/I-ness is th=\r\ne very basis of the entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3.=\r\n Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal =\r\ncosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-b=\r\nodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activ=\r\nities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individualized consciou=\r\nsness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as for an=\r\n astral/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt;   An Astral-bodied being thinks of Manas/s=\r\nense-consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized conscious=\r\nness.\n&gt; &gt;   A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/perceptive-consciousness=\r\n as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt;   Howeve=\r\nr, that individuality is of the Soul not derived from any idea, which is wh=\r\ny it is not lost when the Astral being loses astral consciousness and reinc=\r\narnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   As an example, Devatas, with their=\r\n finer bodies, are able to work through all the beings in all their physica=\r\nl-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni digest=\r\ns the food, and so on..), never getting controlled by Ahamkara that would r=\r\nequire them to say that this particular body is &quot;my body&quot; or that one is mi=\r\nne - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies themselves. Devatas are, howe=\r\nver, Astral/Causal-bodied beings, so they would attempt to influence the Ma=\r\nnas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the other =\r\nhand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; physical body as well as act out their=\r\n Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (rememberin=\r\ng or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of th=\r\ne kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4.=\r\n As per the resurrected Soul of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas compr=\r\nising Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledg=\r\ne, 5 functions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprisin=\r\ng Physical body (16 chemical elements).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Now, as we all know that=\r\n Physical body expires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements c=\r\nomprising it go away at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off =\r\nas a whole in the corresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of different=\r\n constituent ideas slipping out of it at different times. Chitta being the =\r\nstaging idea for all other modifications, can be termed as the last to go, =\r\nwhen the causal body is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chi=\r\ntta.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vib=\r\nrations, \n&gt; &gt;   Manas with Subtle Astral vibrations and \n&gt; &gt;   Chitta with =\r\ninfinitely Subtle Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Buddhi being another variab=\r\nle, can be developed or undeveloped irrespective of the other 34. Even illi=\r\nterate Moodha, through surrender to their Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkar=\r\na and so on...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   BTW, Chitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta d=\r\noes store the residual impressions of all the past incarnations. However, b=\r\neing constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability to act=\r\n upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container containing an inflam=\r\nmable liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana is required for Th=\r\nat.\n&gt; &gt;   The Samskaras stored by Chitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti,=\r\n Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta=\r\n itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEthe=\r\nr tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t=\r\n get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt;   Once the Chitt=\r\na calms down, cleared of all residual impressions, only Satva Guna remains,=\r\n the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on itself as distinct=\r\n from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its own nature as Bra=\r\nhman.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt;   In Patanjali Yoga Sutras:  \n&gt; &gt;   drigadarshanakty=\r\norekatmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt;   Egoism is the identification of the seer with t=\r\nhe instrument of seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n   Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, h=\r\near, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of=\r\n egoism does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Ast=\r\nral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everyth=\r\ning.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousnes=\r\ns is associated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physical K=\r\narma.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousne=\r\nss, must be overcome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography o=\r\nf a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those being=\r\ns who cannot be tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos=\r\n are permitted to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the ey=\r\ne implies Sense-consciousness which is associated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   In=\r\n Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is mentioned in the same manner :\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n dristanushravika vishaya vitrishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;   That effect which comes to these who have given up their thirst after=\r\n objects, either seen or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is =\r\nnon-attachment. Vivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the only way to =\r\nfreedom.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   This is to be accomplished by transferring the consciou=\r\nsness to Astral-Body and working out the Astral Karma or otherwise as an as=\r\ntral-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt;    yogashchittavr=\r\nittinirodhah -2-\n&gt; &gt;    Thus, extinguishing all the movements of Chitta is =\r\ncalled &quot;Yoga&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   This is to be accomplished by transferring the c=\r\nonsciousness to Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or otherwise a=\r\ns a causal-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Ra=\r\no &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid you a=\r\nre mixing up terminologies. For example, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness)=\r\n is not limited to the physical body, but extends to subtle body and causal=\r\n body as well. In fact, ego resides in the causal body and affects other bo=\r\ndies. Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned mind=\r\n) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana sareera (causal bo=\r\ndy) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and=\r\n buddhi also. When manas (sensory-motor mind) observes sensory inputs or bu=\r\nddhi (intellectual or thinking mind) analyzes current and past observations=\r\n of mind or chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) stores various observa=\r\ntions or retrieves previously stored observations, they are all guided by t=\r\nhe sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness permeates through all layers of on=\r\ne&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Upanishads and various scri=\r\nptures have broken down the individualized consciousness into various group=\r\ns by functionality, like five koshas, three sareeras, five praanas, five jn=\r\naanendriyas, five karmendriyas, four antahkaranas, six/seven chakras etc. B=\r\nut ego/ahamkaara/I-ness is the very basis of the entire individualized cons=\r\nciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though the word jnaana means different things to d=\r\nifferent people, a jnaana yogi pursues Self by the path of contemplation an=\r\nd discrimination. When a jnaana yogi reaches the final target, all bodies a=\r\nnd koshas are merged in cosmos.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sp=\r\nirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish l=\r\nessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish softwar=\r\ne (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC=\r\n) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.=\r\narya@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    =\r\nIn my opinion, there are three distinct phases that lead the sould to rise =\r\nabove Ego, Mind and Chitta - corresponding to the three bodies physical (St=\r\nhoola), astral (Sookshma) and causal (Karana) resp.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising=\r\n above Ego is Jnana   - Merging Physical body in Physical cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ri=\r\nsing above Mind is Vairagya - Merging Astral body in Astral cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nRising above Chitta is Yoga   - Merging Causal body in Causal cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Finally, becoming established in Para-Brahman is YogaArudha.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;    Your comments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

One pursuing t=\r\nhat path may or may not debate with others and may or may not read many scr=\r\niptures, but one will analyze and debate within oneself. One starts with th=\r\ne basic axioms (e.g. Self is imperishable and without a beginning or an end=\r\n). One will go on eliminating things that one is aware of as not being Self=\r\n. For example, body has a beginning and end and is perishable. So it is not=\r\n Self. One introspects like this and, though the process of elimination, fi=\r\nnally finds the true Self. That is gyaana yoga. Pure gyaana yoga is very di=\r\nfficult to follow in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vichaara (contemplatio=\r\nn) is the process of sadhana for an adherer of pure gyaana yoga.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, the gyaana (knowledge of Self) achieved by such a pers=\r\non at the end is not really different from the knowledge of Self achieved b=\r\ny a person following another path.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
