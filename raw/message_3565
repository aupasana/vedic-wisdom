Mruth=\r\nam cha me... Bhayam Cha me.. etc.  Is it not like saying &#39;give me death and=\r\n give me fear&#39;  Should it not be like &#39;... Amrutham cha me... Abhayam cha m=\r\ne ie &#39;Give me immortality. .. give me refuge&#39;. I see that there is &#39;S&#39; in s=\r\nloka in the sanskrit version, does this mean the word &#39;Aah&#39; should be prefi=\r\nxed to it wherever it is present?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; - In Shiva Homa using Sri Rudr=\r\nam Chamakam, I was thinking it would be better doing the main homa with Sri=\r\n Rudram and Varshodhara with Chamakam.
