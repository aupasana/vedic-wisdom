I will give my 2 cents of views based on my experience and in=\r\nsights. I will be honest, straight-forward and blunt.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *     =\r\n   *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though believers call priests and get poojas done, in the hope t=\r\nhat their problems will be solved, many priests today are incapable of prod=\r\nucing any results. As a result, some believers got accustomed to accepting =\r\nthat a pudding exists even without eating it and remain hungry throughout l=\r\nife. And some intelligent people stopped believing in god and in remedies. =\r\nLet me first address why this has come to be and then talk about what we sh=\r\nould do.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In ancient times, caste system was not as rigid as it is tod=\r\nay. One&#39;s varna was decided based on one&#39;s aptitude. One primarily interest=\r\ned in knowledge and spiritual progress would be a Brahmana. One primarily i=\r\nnterested in power, authority and control over others would be a Kshatriya.=\r\n One primarily interested in money would be a Vaisya. One primarily interes=\r\nted in physical pleasures would be a Shudra. One would start off with the v=\r\narna of one&#39;s father, as that is what one is exposed to in childhood. Howev=\r\ner, as one&#39;s vasana (mental conditioning) blooms, one would get one&#39;s own v=\r\narna. One born a Shudra like Valmiki, for example, can later turn into a Br=\r\naahmana and become a Maharshi. One born a Kshatriya like Viswamitra, for ex=\r\nample, can later turn into a Brahmana and become a Maharshi.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the o=\r\nld days, there were true Brahmanas, who would only be interested in knowled=\r\nge and spiritual progress and not caring about power, influence, money, ple=\r\nasures etc. Such Brahmanas became quite pure and accumulated enough spiritu=\r\nal energy through continuous sadhana over years and were capable of perform=\r\ning very effective poojas for people.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Today, people who have spiritua=\r\nl potential may be born in non-Brahmana families and not allowed to develop=\r\n fully due to the rigid caste structures. Some people born in Brahmana fami=\r\nlies may also end up getting into modern careers and not developing fully a=\r\ns Brahmanas. Some people may be born in Brahmana families with Kshatriya/Va=\r\nisya/Shudra tendencies and may end up becoming priests who are interested i=\r\nn power, authority and control over others, money and physical pleasures. T=\r\nhose priests who only care about knowledge and spiritual progress (i.e. tru=\r\ne Brahmanas) are very rare. As a result, Brahmanas who have done genuine sa=\r\ndhana and accumulated a good amount of spiritual energy are so few.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *=\r\n        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one has one million dollars in one&#39;s bank accou=\r\nnt, a check given by one for thousand dollars is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank =\r\naccount is empty, what good is a thousand dollar check given by one? It wil=\r\nl bounce. Similarly, poojas done and blessings given by a priest without en=\r\nough spiritual energy cannot bring one any benefits.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One important no=\r\nte: The power is not in a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence o=\r\nf physical actions (ritual). The power is in the MIND that FOCUSES on a com=\r\nbination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). =\r\nEnergy is generated when mind overcomes its tendency to wander and instead =\r\nfocuses on one thing. Different mantras and rituals as the focus points may=\r\n generate different kinds of energy, but the key is focus. Without it, no m=\r\nantra or ritual produces anything. Focus comes with a lot of practice. Most=\r\n priests are just engaging in casual practice when they go and do poojas. I=\r\nn the old days, priests did intense sadhana and brought that energy to the =\r\ntable when they did rituals at the houses of people or in temples.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I =\r\ndid see priests who have done good sadhana, purified themselves and carry s=\r\nome spiritual energy. But those are getting rarer and rarer now-a-days. One=\r\n can most certainly not bank on finding such a priest.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Given this, one is better off not depending on the priest/Brahm=\r\nana class for remedies. BTW, I have nothing against the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot;=\r\n class, having been born in an orthodox Brahmana family myself. I have neit=\r\nher love nor hatred for the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; class. My only wish is that=\r\n more people - from any birth caste - develop into true Brahmanas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In=\r\nstead of a Brahmana-by-birth who is possibly proud of his skills and thinki=\r\nng about money and possibly not identifying with your trouble, you can do t=\r\nhe mantra/ritual yourself. Atleast your identification with the trouble and=\r\n your desire to solve the problem will be better than the priest. If you ma=\r\nnage to generate enough focus after practice, the mantra/ritual may actuall=\r\ny produce some result. There is no harm in trying.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        =\r\n*\n&gt;  \n&gt; Many people think that poojas to gods are a serious matter and only=\r\n a trained priest should do them. The procedures have evolved to become qui=\r\nte complicated over the time too!\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, complexity of rituals shou=\r\nld never be a deterrent. Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calor=\r\nies everyday, 40 grams of protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose =\r\nyou have no access to such balanced food. Will you starve yourself until yo=\r\nu find a balanced meal or will you manage with whatever you have? If you ju=\r\nst have a bowl of dal (lentil soup) and rice, you will simply eat it. You a=\r\ntleast get some energy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, if you do not know the &quot;perfect wa=\r\ny&quot; to do a mantra/ritual, you need not wait till you know the perfect way. =\r\nYou can start with what you know. It will only give you energy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *    =\r\n    *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The fear to do rituals without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; ste=\r\nms from the notion that some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion =\r\nis not totally baseless, but it is irrelevant today.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is possible t=\r\no focus the mind on some mantras and rituals and get specific results. When=\r\n used by someone with a high level of spiritual energy, some mantras and ri=\r\ntuals may work very fast and give specific powerful results. However, Natur=\r\ne has purposely hidden (almost) such things in this age.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I will give =\r\nan analogy. A machine gun and a stick can be used to attack enemies. Stick =\r\nis safe to use, but, one using a machine gun needs to be very careful. One =\r\nneeds to learn well, practice well and then use it, lest one should hurt on=\r\neself by accident.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, suppose the house lord purposely removed =\r\nammunition from the machine gun. Then it is used just like a stick and not =\r\nrisky. Instead of waiting for perfect instructions on how to use the machin=\r\ne gun, just take it and start beating your enemies with it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Ammuniti=\r\non&quot; has purposely been removed from most targeted mantras and rituals (mach=\r\nine guns) in this age. Instead of waiting for perfect knowledge, one can st=\r\nart using them right away.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A lot of technicalities related to mantras=\r\n and rituals are irrelevant today. Mantras and rituals are to be taken up w=\r\nith faith, devotion and surrender to god. Whatever technicalities one can r=\r\nealistically follow should be followed and emphasis should be placed on dev=\r\notion and surrender. If one keeps doing sadhana, eventually one&#39;s devotion =\r\nand focus will improve and, for all you know, a result may come.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Give=\r\nn that we do not have perfect focus and surrender, we cannot expect specifi=\r\nc results to come in specific counts of recitation. So we should just do th=\r\ne best job we can and leave the result to god, who decides when and what re=\r\nsult should be given.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bottomline is that no effort is wasted in the e=\r\nnd. Every sincere effort generates some fruit or the other, sometime or the=\r\n other!!!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Different mantras and rituals are=\r\n like begging bowls of different shapes. They matter only so much. Dependin=\r\ng on what kind of a begging bowl you use, you may be given different kind o=\r\nf alms. But it is important to start begging with some begging bowl or the =\r\nother, instead of spending years looking for the perfect begging bowl.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Instead of waiting for astrologers with half-baked or ill-conceived knowl=\r\nedge to tell you the perfect mantra or ritual, do what your heart tells you=\r\n or what your guru (or an elder you respect) tells you. Mantras like Gayatr=\r\ni mantra, Shiva panchakshari mantra, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi =\r\natharva seersha, Hanuman chalisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu&#39;s shada=\r\nkshari/ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, Venkateswara&#39;s ashtakshari/dwadasa=\r\nkshari mantra, hare krishna mantra, Chandipath (Durga saptashati), Durga sa=\r\nptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama stotra, Vyasa&#39;s navagraha stotra, Aditya Hri=\r\ndayam, Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaama stotra etc are *generic* and can work f=\r\nor anyone for any purpose.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Do not waste time looking for a perfect re=\r\ncommendation, perfect procedure, perfect muhurta etc and just do some sadha=\r\nna or the other with a sincere heart.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Your effort will not go waste. =\r\nYour problem may be solved or you may overcome your situation and stop worr=\r\nying, or atleast your focus will improve.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I=\r\nn this context, I want to say a few words about homam, the sadhana of rishi=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fire ritual is found in many ancient religions. Unlike the elements=\r\n of earth, water and air, fire is ever pure and it purifies whatever it com=\r\nes in contact with. The Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e.  purifier. =\r\nFire is a living god that everyone has access to. Spending time worshipping=\r\n god through fire purifies one&#39;s subtle consciousness. Homam is far more ef=\r\nfective than most other sadhanas in improving one&#39;s focus, changing one&#39;s i=\r\nnner personality and removing material and spiritual obstacles. One need no=\r\nt take my words for granted. One can try for oneself for a few months. The =\r\nproof of the pudding is in eating it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Vedic seers (rishis) performed =\r\nhomam regularly, for the benefit of the world. When composing the Jyotish m=\r\nasterpiece &quot;Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram&quot; just before the advent of Kal=\r\ni yuga, for guidance to the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara recommen=\r\nded various types of homam as remedial measures for various problems in the=\r\n horoscope. In fact, most remedies he recommended involve homam. Parasara a=\r\nsked to follow whatever procedures one was taught for starting fire and did=\r\n not focus on the nitty gritty of homam. He only gave the main mantra to be=\r\nused in homam. Parasara&#39;s clear teachings set to rest the notion that some =\r\npeople have, that homam is not for Kali yuga.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna said, &quot;yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi&quot;, i.e. I a=\r\nm japa among all sacrifices. Some people use this line to suggest that japa=\r\nm (meditation) is superior to homa/yajna. Let me put that in perspective.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; In the line just above that line, Sri Krishna also said, &quot;I am Om amon=\r\ng all mantras&quot;. However, do we only meditate with the supreme mantra &quot;Om&quot; a=\r\nnd leave all other mantras?\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one says that sitting on the pinnacle =\r\nis the best part of climbing a mountain, it does not mean that the process =\r\nof climbing it using various kinds of gear is useless. In fact, one needs t=\r\nhat process to reach the pinnacle. Most cannot reach the pinnacle directly.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, Om is the supreme of all mantras being the source of all,=\r\n but reaching the source may require using several mantras first to purify =\r\noneself. Meditating and absorbing consciousness in the Supreme (japa) may b=\r\ne the supreme sacrifice, but it may require purification and preparation by=\r\n engaging in other kinds of sacrifices (hama/yajna).\n&gt;  \n&gt; When one does ho=\r\nmam or yajna, one is engaging in external actions and one is unlikely to re=\r\nach samadhi (absorbption in the Supreme). When a perfectly purified person =\r\ndoes japam (i.e. sits still and contemplates), one may reach samadhi. Howev=\r\ner, to purify oneself, homam is far more effective.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *       =\r\n *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Detailed manuals giving short procedures for doing various types o=\r\nf homam by oneself are available on the website given below. You can use th=\r\ne resources on that website to perform several kinds of short homam by your=\r\nself.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Now *hundreds* of people are performing homam by themselves eit=\r\nher daily or weekly. Some people are also doing monthly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When Manish =\r\n(my spiritual guru - a small write-up on him can be read in message 3481 of=\r\n vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, i.e. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/m=\r\nessage/3481) told me that the Divine Mother appeared before him during Shat=\r\na Chandi homam at a temple in Chennai in March 2006, directed him to spread=\r\n a simplified homam ritual around the world, and showed him that hundreds o=\r\nf thousands of people would be performing regular homam in a few years, thu=\r\ns helping reverse the decay of Dharma and Truth on earth, it seemed quite f=\r\nar-fetched to my rational mind.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, just 4 years after the Mothe=\r\nr&#39;s command, hundreds of people are already performing regular homam. Thoug=\r\nh these are just the early days, the developments are amazing. Some of them=\r\n are laymen who never even lit a lamp and did not know how to do ANY pooja =\r\nor ritual. It is a miracle that such people are doing a homam everyday, lik=\r\ne the rishis and Brahmanas of yore. I also know personally that some people=\r\n doing homam for a couple of years are actually starting to experience thin=\r\ngs within and outside and, more importantly, going through rapid internal t=\r\nransformation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am neither a missionary no=\r\nr a mercenary. I do not sell anything to anyone, nor do I force anything on=\r\n anyone. I just freely share what I know, what I saw and what I am inspired=\r\n to share. The rest is not in my hands.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I want to respectfully, humbl=\r\ny and lovingly invite those who have even an iota of interest to check out =\r\nthe homam website! If one gets into the habit of performing homam regularly=\r\n, it has the great potential to transform one&#39;s life, materially and spirit=\r\nually..\n&gt;  \n&gt; Homam website:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;  \n&gt; B=\r\nest regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotis=\r\nh Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tar=\r\npana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that =\r\nmake a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
