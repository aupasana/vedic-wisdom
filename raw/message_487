He took\n&gt; Maha samadhi in Bombay and his Samadhi i=\r\ns located in Phuskar \n&gt; Rajasthan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Babaji is also know as Ranchod Dasj=\r\ni Maharaj, Paramhans of \nChirtakut \n&gt; and some more names too. He was a Mah=\r\naratrian Deshasth brahmin by \n&gt; birth and was born in Gwailor district in M=\r\nP.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ranchod Dasji Maharaj name was given to him by his disciples in \n&gt; =\r\nGujarat.\n&gt; \n&gt; He may have lived for 700 plus years.\n&gt; \n&gt; He ran away from h=\r\nome at a very tender age and was taken up a \n&gt; disciple by Bala Krishna Das=\r\nji also known as Paihari Baba.\n&gt; Paihari baba was also very releaized, he o=\r\nnly drank milk and so the \n&gt; name. Paihari Baba was Gujarati by birth but s=\r\npoke in Hindi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Paihari Baba lived in Kulu for a long time, than in Pus=\r\nhkar, he was \n&gt; in Pushkar when the temple of Srinathji was moved from Math=\r\nura to \n&gt; Rajasthan. At that time he did a lot of seva of lord Krishna in \n=\r\n&gt; Pushkar. \n&gt; After that he lived in Galtaji near jaipur in Rajasthan. \n&gt; B=\r\nabaji also lived in Galtaji for about 12 years and he had the \nvision \n&gt; of=\r\n Lord Rama in the same cave, that exists today too.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is located a fe=\r\nw miles from Jaipur, there are a few temples \nthere \n&gt; near the cave. I hav=\r\ne visited this cave too.\n&gt; \n&gt; From Galtaji Paihari Baba moved to Revasa and=\r\n than to Kashmir where \n&gt; he lived in a place called &quot;Rasayani Gufa&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nPaihari Baba also may have lived for 500 plus years too.\n&gt; \n&gt; While at Galt=\r\naji, the Famous Tulsidas maharaj had visited Paihari \n&gt; Baba and give a han=\r\nd written manuscipt of Ramayana.\n&gt; \n&gt; They belong to the Ramanandi Samprada=\r\nya who has Lord Ram and \nGoddess \n&gt; Sita devi as ishta devata. Ramanandi Sa=\r\nmpardaya came as an offshot \nof \n&gt; Ramanuja Sampradaya.\n&gt; \n&gt; Babaji or Ranc=\r\nhod Dasji Maharaj lived for many years in Bengal, \n&gt; Chitrakot and Also vis=\r\nited Gujarat. He also stayed in Kashmir.\n&gt; One of the kings of Kashmir was =\r\na devout disciple of Paihari Baba.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both Babaji and Paihari Baba were a=\r\ndept in &quot;kaya kalpa&quot; and they \nalso \n&gt; had strong connection with saints lo=\r\ncated in Tibet.\n&gt; \n&gt; Paihari Baba used to remain in samadhi at a stretch fo=\r\nr 2 to 3 \nyears.\n&gt; Paihari Baba as a young brahamchari served also Swami Ra=\r\nmananda in \n&gt; Kashi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ranchoddasji Maharaj has samadhi in Pushkar, A tr=\r\nust in Rajkot, \n&gt; Gujarat and also in Chitakut too. At these places they do=\r\n \ncharitable \n&gt; activities.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ranchoddasji Maharaj had many disciples bu=\r\nt he never made anybody \nhis \n&gt; sucessor.\n&gt; \n&gt; A lot of books have been wri=\r\ntten by one or two lady disciples of \n&gt; Ranchoddasji Maharaj and all this i=\r\nnformation written here is \ncoming \n&gt; from those books. these books are avi=\r\nalable in his ashrams. They \nare \n&gt; written in Gujarati and Hindi Dialect.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; These books describe Ranchoddasji Maharaj&#39;s teachings, his view on \n&gt; =\r\nmany things, his short speeches and kind of like biography.\n&gt; \n&gt; These are =\r\nvery good books, they describe many aspects of \nspirtuality \n&gt; in simple la=\r\nymans language.\n&gt; \n&gt; Babaji indicated that Lahiri Mahashaya was his discipl=\r\ne for 5 births\n&gt; and in this birth with kriya yoga he cleared all his impre=\r\nssions \nand \n&gt; was given authority to guide people and initiate in kriya yo=\r\nga \nafter \n&gt; relalizing his true nature. Like him he had another disciple i=\r\nn \n&gt; Bengal too known as &quot;Din bandhu&quot; but I do not have any information \non=\r\n \n&gt; him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Babaji did meet Shri Yuteshwar Maharaj a few times.\n&gt; \n&gt; He a=\r\nlso indicated that many advanced saints from the Nath \nSampradaya \n&gt; also t=\r\nook birth and followed the ramanandi sampradaya to experiance \n&gt; more bliss=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; My intent here is to share information and not start any \n&gt; controve=\r\nrsies.\n&gt; \n&gt; If anyone needs the names of these books and also the address o=\r\nf \n&gt; ashrams, I am very happy to provide that too.\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is interes=\r\nt in more information than I shall try to write \n&gt; more about the lineage a=\r\nnd the prominent saints of the lineage too.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also have many pictures =\r\nof Ranchoddasji Maharaj, but am not sure \n&gt; how to load them up for you all=\r\n to see.\n&gt; \n&gt; Happy Navratri\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Mitesh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
