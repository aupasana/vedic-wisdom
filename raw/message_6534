After a man has realised the nature of the rope, the trembling caused=\r\n\nby the\nerroneous idea of the snake disappears gradually only and the idea =\r\nof the\nsnake still\nsometimes haunts him when he sees a rope in darkness.\n\n2=\r\n47. In the example already cited, the tenth man, who may have been crying\na=\r\nnd\nbeating his head in sorrow, stops lamenting on realising that the tenth =\r\nis\nnot dead;\nbut the wounds caused by beating his head take a month gradual=\r\nly to heal.\n\n255. Let the ignorant people of the world perform worldly acti=\r\nons and desire\nto possess wives, children and wealth. I am full of supreme =\r\nbliss. For what\npurpose should I engage myself in worldly concerns ?\n\n279. =\r\nThe realm of duality, destroyed by knowledge, may still be perceived by\nthe=\r\n\nsenses, but such perception does not affect illumination. A living rat\ncan=\r\nnot kill a cat;then how can it do so when dead ?\n\nVIII. THE LAMP OF KUTASTH=\r\nA\n\n21. That consciousness which witnesses the interval between the\ndisappea=\r\nrance and the rise of successive Vrittis and the period when they do\nnot ex=\r\nist and which is itself unmodifiable and immutable, is called\nKutastha.\n\n37=\r\n. The Upanishad says that the Self (Atman) thought: =E2=80=98This body with=\r\n the\norgans\ncannot live without me=E2=80=99, and so cleaving the centre of =\r\nthe skull it entered\ninto the\nbody and started experiencing the changeable =\r\nstates (e.g., wakeful, dreaming\netc.,).\n\n39. The Self becomes the ego ident=\r\nifying itself with the body composed of\nthe five\nelements and when the body=\r\n perishes (once for all) the ego too perishes with\nit.\nThus said Yajnavalky=\r\na to Maitreyi.\n\n40. =E2=80=98This Self is not perishable=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93=\r\n thus the Shruti differentiates the\nKutastha from\neverything else. =E2=80=\r\n=98The Self is associationless=E2=80=99 =E2=80=93 such statements sing the\n=\r\neverdetached state of Kutastha.\n\n41. The passage which says that the body o=\r\nnly dies and not the Jiva does not\nmean\nthat he is released but only that h=\r\ne transmigrates.\n\n43. A man may be mistaken for the stump of a tree; but th=\r\ne notion of the\nstump is destroyed when the man is known to be a man. Simil=\r\narly, when the\nJiva knows =E2=80=98I am Brahman=E2=80=99, his notion =E2=80=\r\n=98I am Buddhi (the ego-consciousness in\nthe mind)=E2=80=99 is destroyed.\n\n=\r\n48. The consciousness, the substratum on which the illusion of Chidabhasa\nt=\r\nogether\nwith the body and the sense organs is superimposed, is known as Kut=\r\nastha in\nVedanta.\n\n57-58. As the support of the unreal world, its nature is=\r\n existence; as it\ncognises all insentient objects, its nature is consciousn=\r\ness; and as it is\nalways the object of love,its nature is bliss. It is call=\r\ned Shiva, the\ninfinite, being the means of revelation of all objects and be=\r\ning related to\nthem as their substratum.\n\n63. When we sleep, our dreams cre=\r\nate even Jiva and Ishvara. What wonder is\nthere then that the Great Maya cr=\r\neates them in the waking state ?\n\nIX. THE LAMP OF MEDITATION\n\n14. After ind=\r\nirectly knowing the one indivisible homogeneous Brahman from\nthe books on V=\r\nedanta, one should meditate on or think repeatedly =E2=80=98I am\nBrahman=E2=\r\n=80=99.\n\n15. Without realising Brahman to be one=E2=80=99s own Self, the ge=\r\nneral knowledge of\nHim\nderived through the study of the scriptures, viz., =\r\n=E2=80=98Brahman is=E2=80=99, is here\ncalled indirect knowledge, just as ou=\r\nr knowledge of the forms of Vishnu\netc., is called.\n\n16. One may have knowl=\r\nedge of Vishnu from scriptures as having four arms\netc., but if one does no=\r\nt have a vision of Him, he is said to have only\nindirect knowledge,inasmuch=\r\n as he has not seen Him with his eyes.\n\n18. From the scripture a man may ha=\r\nve a conception of Brahman as existence,\nconsciousness and bliss but he can=\r\nnot have a direct knowledge of Brahman\nunless\nBrahman is cognised as the in=\r\nner witness in his own personality.\n\n33. If a person does not realise the S=\r\nelf even after practising till death,\nhe will surely realise it in a future=\r\n life when all the obstacles will have\nbeen eliminated.\n\n34. Knowledge will=\r\n arise either in this birth or the next, says the author\nof the\nBrahma Sutr=\r\nas. The Shruti also says that there are many who listen to the\nteachings\non=\r\n non-duality and yet do not realise in this life.\n\n35. By virtue of the pra=\r\nctice of spiritual enquiry in a previous birth,\nVamadeva had realisation ev=\r\nen while in his mother=E2=80=99s womb. Such results are\nalso seen in the ca=\r\nse of studies.\n\n36. In spite of reading many times a boy may not be able to=\r\n memorise\nsomething,but sometimes, next morning, without any further study,=\r\n he\nremembers all that he has read.\n\n47. Because of his practice of enquiry=\r\n such a Yogi enters into the heaven of\nthe\nmeritorious and then if he is no=\r\nt freed from desires, he is born again in a\npious and\nprosperous family.\n\nS=\r\nource: http://www.celextel.org/othervedantabooks/panchadasi.html\n\n-- \n=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636833df6d7374104a5a49633\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;Translated by Swami Swahananda Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chenna=\r\ni&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;244.
