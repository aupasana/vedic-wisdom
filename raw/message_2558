Choose the highest ideal and live your life upto that. Look at the\n&quot;ocean&quot; and not at the wave.\n\n2. That which tends to increase the divinity in you is virtue, and that\nwhich tends to increase brutality in you is vice.\n\n3. He who sees Shiva in the poor, in the weak, and in the diseased, really\nworships Shiva.\n\n4. Purity in thought, speech, and act is absolutely necessary for anyone to\nbe religious. Purity is strength. Spiritual truth is purity.\n\n\n5. The ideal of the man is to see God in everything. The real evil is\nidleness which is the principal cause of our poverty.\n\n6. Everyone should know that there is no salvation except through the\nconquering of desires.\n\n7. Death being so certain, it is better to die for a good cause.\n\n8. Religion is the manifestation of the Divinity already in man.\n\n9. Your country reqires heroes, be heroes!\n\n10. To me the very essence of education is concentration of the mind, not\nthe collecting of facts.\n\n11. Each soul is potentially divine.\n\n12. Religion is the idea which is raising the brute unto man, and man unto\nGod.\n\n13. All power is within you; you can do anything and everything. Believe in\nthat.\n\n14. Work, work, work - let this be your motto.\n\n15. Now the only way out is to listen to the words of the Lord in the Gita.\n\n16. Be a hero. Always say, &quot;I have no fear&quot;.\n\n17. Struggle hard to get money, but don&#39;t get attached to it.\n\n18. Feel that you are great and you become great.\n\n19. To devote your life to the good of all and to the happiness of all is\nreligion. Whatever you do for your own sake is not religion.\n\n20. At my will mountains will crumble up. Have that sort of energy, that\nsort of will; work hard, and you will reach the goal.\n\n21. It is those foolish people who identify themselves with their bodies\nthat piteously cry, &#39;Weak, weak, we are weak&#39;.\n\n22. Keep the motto before you: &quot;Elevation of the masses without injuring\ntheir religion&quot;.\n\n23. Man never progresses from error to truth, but from truth to truth, from\nlesser truth to higher truth.\n\n24. Avoid all weakness, for weakness is sin, weakness is death.\n\n25. Never talk about the faults of others, no matter how bad they may be.\nNothing is ever gained by that.\n\n26. I shall inspire men everywhere until the world shall know that it is one\nwith God.\n\n27. Let us go forward and do yet greater things.\n\n28. The more selfish a man, the more immoral he is.\n\n29. Give to the weak, for there all the gift is needed.\n\n30. Knowledge exists, man only discovers it.\n\n31. Give up all desire for enjoyment in earth or heaven.\n\n32. Be courageous. Do not try to lead your brethren, but serve them.\n\n33. Be the witness and do not react, only thus can you be happy.\n\n34. None can help you, help yourself; work out your own salvation.\n\n35. Be not afraid of anything. You will do marvellous work.\n\n36. Try to love anybody and everybody.\n\n37. You have to grow from the inside out. None can teach you, none can make\nyou spiritual. There is no other teacher but your own soul. Know it for\ncertain that you are in everything.\n\n38. Go on bravely. Do not expect success in a day or a year.\n\n39. Let all your nerves vibrate through the backbone of your religion.\n\n40. Do not talk much, but feel the spirit within you.\n\n41. If you want to be spiritual, you must renounce.\n\n42. Your way is the best for you, but that is no sign that it is the best\nfor others.\n\n43. Renounce the lower so that you may get the higher.\n\n44. Where can we go to find God if we cannot see Him in our own hearts and\nin every living being?\n\n45. Your work is to serve the poor and miserable, without distinction of\ncaste or colour.\n\nHelp another because you are in him and he is in you.\n\n46. The poor, the illiterate, the ignorant, the afflicted,.. .let these be\nyour God. Know that service to these alone is the highest religion.\n\n47. If I am in the dark, let me light a lamp.\n\n48. The earth&#39;s bravest and best will have to sacrifice themselves for the\ngood of many, for the welfare of all.\n\n49. Every duty is holy, and devotion to duty is the highest form of worship\nof God.\n\n50. We only get what we deserve. It is a lie when we say, the world is bad\nand we are good. It can never be so.\n\n51. You will understand the mighty strength of Krishna better with a little\nof strong blood in you.\n\n52. It is struggle against nature and not conformity to nature that makes\nman what he is.\n\n53. Each work has to pass through these stages - ridicule, opposition and\nthen acceptance.\n\n54. First there should be strict integrity... Secondly, entire devotion to\nthe cause.\n\n55. The will is not free - it is a phenomenon bound by cause and effect -\nbut there is something behind the will which is free.\n\n56. You fail only when you do not strive sufficiently to manifest infinite\npower.\n\n57. Whatever you do, devote your whole Mind, Heart, and Soul to it.\n\n58. Whatever you think, that you will be. If you think yourselves weak, weak\nyou will be; if you think yourselves strong, strong you will be.\n\n59. Never mind failures; they are quite natural, they are the beauty of life\n- these failures.\n\n60. He works best who works without any motive, neither for money, nor for\nfame, nor for anything else.\n\n61. The new religion says that he is an atheist who does not believe in\nhimself.\n\n62. Neither seek nor avoid, take what comes.\n\n63. You should work like a master and not as a slave; work incessantly, but\ndo not do a slave&#39;s work.\n\n64. Believe that the soul is immortal, infinite and all powerful.\n\n65. Even if the order be wrong, first obey and then contradict it.\n\n66.
