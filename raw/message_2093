That somehow reminded me of a=\r\n story.\n \nSometime back, mother of a young man came to me to show his chart=\r\n. She was asking about his studies etc. But the chart was brilliant from th=\r\ne spiritual point of view. There were many tell-tale combinations. I declar=\r\ned, &quot;this is not the chart of a materialistic person, but that of a sannyas=\r\ni (ascetic/monk).&quot; She broke down into tears and gave me some background. I=\r\n found out that he indeed wants to leave material life and his mother does =\r\nnot want him to.\n \nThis boy had been calm, peaceful, contented and an intro=\r\nvert since childhood. Oneday in his early teenage days, he had an interesti=\r\nng experience. He was in his room upstairs. His father was teaching math to=\r\n some students downstairs. He was hearing all those voices. Suddenly, he st=\r\nopped hearing anything. He did not hear or see anything for a while. His mi=\r\nnd was completely blacked out. After a while, his mind returned to normalcy=\r\n and he saw and heard everything. But he felt a tremendous sense of bliss a=\r\nnd contentment then. He was overwhelmed by what he felt then.\n \nHe realized=\r\n that what people pursue as happiness is nothing in front of what he experi=\r\nenced then. He did not want to study or do anything anymore. He only wanted=\r\n to experience that state. His parents became worried and took him to docto=\r\nrs. Doctors did all kinds of tests on his brain and found nothing. He was a=\r\nlso confined to a mental facility for one month. They put him on powerful d=\r\nrugs and kept him under observation. He kept telling the doctors that there=\r\n was nothing wrong with him and that they would not understand what he expe=\r\nrienced. After a month, those doctors concluded he was normal and had no pr=\r\noblem. The powerful drugs he received during the month wreaked havoc on him=\r\n, but he was not angry or mad at his parents or doctors. He says he underst=\r\nands his parents love him and hence they did all this. He does not want to =\r\nhurt them. He also says he knows what he wants but does not know how to get=\r\n it. But he knows that regular studies and regular material life will not g=\r\net him what he wants.\n \nWhen I chatted with him alone, I realized that he i=\r\ns a brilliant young man with clear thinking. He is certainly not a mad pers=\r\non. He just needs someone to show him a spiritual path to make something pe=\r\nrmanent, which temporarily came to him and left him! To get it permanently =\r\nnow, he needs to do serious sadhana. His parents also took him to many so-c=\r\nalled swamijis, but he was not satisfied with the advice given anyone. He s=\r\ntarted reading Ramana Maharshi and a few others and liked some of them. But=\r\n he is still without a clear direction.\n \nInterestingly, just when I was ab=\r\nout to chat with this person after making his parents leave, my guru Manish=\r\n called me. He asked me what was going on. I mentioned that I was about to =\r\ntalk to a teenager who had a nice chart. He asked for the birthdata, checke=\r\nd it out and confirmed my feeling that this boy had great spiritual potenti=\r\nal.\n \n\nUnfortunately, the system we have in place looked at him with suspic=\r\nion and gave powerful drugs to mess up his mind for one full month! He is l=\r\nucky and survived the ordeal. This is a sign of the times we live in that s=\r\nomeone who realizes, albeit momentarily, the essence of scriptures, is labe=\r\nled as a mentally disturbed person and powerful drugs are given to him, ins=\r\ntead of clear spiritual direction to make that realization more permanent.\n=\r\n Best regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/=\r\nhomam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSp=\r\nirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons=\r\n (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows):=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://=\r\nwww.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------ \n\n\n\n\n_________________________________________________________=\r\n________\nGet the best of MSN on your mobile\nhttp://clk.atdmt.com/UKM/go/147=\r\n991039/direct/01/\r\n--_ec079c2b-2ff7-4b5d-ac4b-7936df5456ff_\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;\n&lt;head&gt;\n&lt;style&gt;\n.hmmessage P\n{\nmargin:0px;\npadding:0px\n}\nbody.hmmessa=\r\nge\n{\nfont-size: 10pt;\nfont-family:Verdana\n}\n&lt;/style&gt;\n&lt;/head&gt;\n&lt;body class=3D=\r\n&#39;hmmessage&#39;&gt;\n&lt;BR&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;BR&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;\nThnak you for your email be=\r\nlow.
