(Even if at the \ndifferent plane of existence) or the people\n&gt; wh=\r\no criticize are right when they say that \nyours is a full of stories which =\r\nare\n&gt; only mythological and you pray those imaginary \nGods which are nothin=\r\ng\n&gt; but characters of Stories of some \nwriter.\n&gt;=A0\n&gt; I could not answer th=\r\ne question as i was not \nsure.\n=A0\nThis somehow reminds of a question posed=\r\n by Balaram Basu to \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa. According to Ramakrishna&#39;s di=\r\nvine vision, Balaram Basu \nbelonged in a previous birth to the inner circle=\r\n of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu! \nBalaram Basu was very devout and pious, did many=\r\n \nausterities and spent many years serving saints at Puri, away from his ho=\r\nmetown \nof Calcutta. Yet, he had his doubts on the existence of god.\n=A0\nWh=\r\nen he met Ramakrishna for the first time, he sat \nin a corner and listened =\r\nto Ramakrishna&#39;s words. When other people in the room \nleft, Ramakrishna tu=\r\nrned to Balaram and asked him, &quot;Is there anything you want \nto ask me?&quot;\n=A0=\r\n\nBalaram asked, &quot;Yes, sir. Does God really exist?&quot; \nRamakrishna answered, &quot;=\r\nCertainly He does.&quot; Balaram asked, &quot;Can a person see Him?&quot;\n=A0\nRamakrishna =\r\nsaid, &quot;Yes, He reveals Himself to the \ndevotee who thinks of Him as his nea=\r\nrest and dearest. Because you do not get any \nresponse by praying to Him on=\r\nce, you must not conclude that He does not \nexist.&quot;\n=A0\nBalaram asked, &quot;But=\r\n why can&#39;t I see Him when I pray \nto Him so much?&quot;\n=A0\nRamakrishna smiled a=\r\nnd asked, &quot;Do you really \nconsider Him to be as dear to your heart as your =\r\nown children?&quot;\n=A0\n&quot;No, sir&quot;, Balaram candidly answered, &quot;I never felt \ntha=\r\nt strongly for Him.&quot;\n=A0\nRamakrishna then said in a sweet, convincing voice=\r\n: \n&quot;Pray to God, thinking of Him as dearer than your own self. Truly I tell=\r\n you, He \nis extremely fond of His devotees. He cannot but reveal Himself t=\r\no them. He \ncomes to a person even before He is sought. If a person comes o=\r\nne step towards \nGod, God comes ten steps towards that person. There is non=\r\ne more intimate and \nmore affectionate than God.&quot;\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 \n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nAs Ramakrishna once said, one needs to th=\r\nink of god \nmore than one thinks about parents, wife, children and about on=\r\neself, all put \ntogether. Try to do that. Then you will find the answer to =\r\nyour question \nyourself. A theoretical answer is useless. The proof of the =\r\npudding is in *your* \neating it. If somebody else tells you that the puddin=\r\ng exists and one can eat \nit, that information has very limited use. In ord=\r\ner to convince yourself fully, \nyou need to taste the pudding yourself!\n=A0=\r\n\nThough all gods and their stories are maya from a \nstrictly vedantic point=\r\n of view, they are as much real as your own mind. If your \nmind is real, al=\r\nl gods and their stories are real. When mind is in various \nplanes of aware=\r\nness, it is possible for the mind to become aware of gods and \ntheir plays.=\r\n\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 \n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nIn this context, =\r\nI want to mention a small story. \nManish was approached by a Christian miss=\r\nionary in UK once. He asked Manish if \nhe was a Hindu. Then he told Manish =\r\nabout how Jesus Christ is the son of the \nreal god, how Hindus are praying =\r\nto unreal and wrong gods and hence doomed and \nhow followers of Jesus Chris=\r\nt will go o heaven, etc. Manish asked the person, \n&quot;have you seen god or Je=\r\nsus Christ&quot;. The person was perplexed and said no. \nManish asked him &quot;how d=\r\no you then know that what you say is true? Are you sure \nthat you guys have=\r\n understood Jesus Christ correctly and not misrepresenting his \nteachings n=\r\now?&quot; Then he=A0mentioned calmly and confidently,=A0&quot;Actually, I \nhave seen =\r\nJesus Christ. If you want, I can show him to you too. Do you \nwant to see h=\r\nim?&quot; The missionary looked at him like a crazy person and simply \nran away.=\r\n\n=A0\nSee, one who is waxing eloquent about real god, son \nof god and heaven=\r\n does not even think that it is possible for someone \nto see Jesus Christ. =\r\nWhen he was told that somebody saw Jesus and asked if he \nwas interested in=\r\n seeing, he thought the other person must be crazy and \njust=A0ran away! He=\r\n wasn&#39;t even curious to pursue further and see what the \nother person was u=\r\npto. He simply concluded the other person is \ncrazy!\n=A0\nPeople these days,=\r\n in many religions, have no \nfaith. Even things that are quite=A0possible s=\r\neem impossible to people of \nthis age.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 \n*=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nThose who have seen the movie &quot;Lage Raho Munnabhai&quot; \n=\r\nmay recall how Sanjay Dutt starts getting visions of Gandhi. He sees and he=\r\nars \nGandhi while others cannot. It is concluded at the end that the vision=\r\ns of \nGandhi were hallucinations caused by the attachment of the stressed o=\r\nut mind to \nGandhi and resulting chemical imbalance in the brain.\n=A0\nLoose=\r\nly speaking, one may say that seeing gods is \nsimilar. But the difference i=\r\ns that=A0it is far more blissful. For another \nbig difference, see the exam=\r\nple:\n=A0\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951\n=A0\nGod can=\r\n be experienced as light, as sound or as a \nspecific form similar to a huma=\r\nn form, etc. In the above example, one goddess \nwas experienced as sound. I=\r\nt can certainly be=A0a hallucination, but the \ninteresting thing is that an=\r\nother person had the same experience and he knew \nthat this first=A0person =\r\nhad that experience!\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 \n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=\r\n=A0\nI will give another similar example. One person who \ndoes Chandi homam =\r\neveryday called Lord Rama in fire after Chandi homam on a Sri \nRama Navami =\r\nmorning and did a homam to Lord Rama. In the night, he made some \npreparati=\r\nons for the next day&#39;s homam (like he would do every night) and laid \nout s=\r\nome dried coconut pieces in homa kundam, on top of previous day&#39;s burnt \nas=\r\nhes,=A0for starting fire on the next morning. He then went to sleep. In the=\r\n \nmiddle of the night, he woke up. He became aware of his body lying on the=\r\n bed. \nHe then became aware of the homa kundam which was a few feet away on=\r\n another \nfloor. It felt like his body and homa kundam were linked. Then it=\r\n felt like \nsuddenly there was fire in homa kundam and, at the same time, h=\r\nis energy rose. \nAs soon as that happened, he lost regular awareness of his=\r\n body. He no \nlonger felt his body or homa kundam or energy in the body. He=\r\n first felt like he \nlied with head down and legs up and then he became abs=\r\nolutely weightless. Then \nhe felt like he was a small point, a small partic=\r\nle. It felt like Lord Hanuman \npulled him up and he went very fast into a r=\r\negion filled with bright light. He \nwas a weightless particle floating in t=\r\nhat light along with Lord Hanuman and \nnobody else. He, the small particle,=\r\n=A0started praying to Lord Hanuman and \nremained in a blissful state for a =\r\nwhile.\n=A0\nSuddenly, from somewhere, a thought came about his \nbody being i=\r\nn a bedroom and fire in homa kundam. He wondered, &quot;was there fire in \nhoma =\r\nkundam really?&quot; This disturbed his state and his regular self-awareness \n(i=\r\n.e.. being aware of self as a body) returned.\n=A0\nThe interesting thing is =\r\nthis. When he went to his \nhoma kundam to do homam next morning, he saw tha=\r\nt the dried coconut pieces \nplaced there on the ashes=A0previous night were=\r\n burnt and completely black. \nIt means there was indeed a fire in the homa =\r\nkundam. He used the same \nprocedure everyday and placed coconut pieces on t=\r\nhe ashes for the next day&#39;s \nhomam before sleeping, but such a thing never =\r\nhappened. Basically, there must \nhave been some ember left still from the p=\r\nrevious morning, though he did not see \nany ember in the night and thought =\r\nthe fire went out completely. For some \nreason, that unseen ember started u=\r\np a small fire in the night and the coconut \npieces caught fire. Though the=\r\nre is no way to know when that happened, it is \nconsistent with what he fel=\r\nt during the mystical experience! After daily homam \nfor a long time, a rel=\r\nationship formed between him and the homa kundam. \nMoreover, the ember left=\r\n in homa kundam continued to be linked to his internal \nfire and developmen=\r\nts related to it still affected his internal fire and \nconsciousness!\n=A0\nW=\r\nhen you do homam for a long time with the mental \nvisualization linking tha=\r\nt external fire to your internal fire, the relationship \nis formed over the=\r\n time! What happens in that external fire does then \naffect your consciousn=\r\ness. Even if the fire goes and ember is left buried under \nthe ash, that em=\r\nber is still linked to your internal fire!! When something \nhappens in your=\r\n internal fire, the same thing happens to the ember too. And vice \nversa.\n=\r\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 \n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nDear Utpal, one ca=\r\nn see God for sure. One can \nexperience God in many forms. One can see god =\r\nexternally, in a limited form like \na human form. One can see god internall=\r\ny, when shakti (energy of self-awareness) \nrises to a specific place and be=\r\ncomes aware of beings in that place. One can \nexperience god as an all-perv=\r\nading light or sound and experience oneself as a \nsmall part of that light =\r\nor sound. There are many ways to perceive god, but the \nbottomline is that =\r\ngod does exist and one can perceive god. I \ncannot show you god, but I can =\r\nguarantee you that god exists and can be \nperceived in various forms.\n=A0\nD=\r\no homam everyday with sincerity. That will burn \nthe blocking karmas. Event=\r\nually you will be able to love god more than anything, \nincluding yourself.=\r\n That is when the final screen will start to disappear. \nNothing can be a s=\r\nubstitute for spiritual sadhana.\n=A0\nBest \nregards,\nNarasimha\n-------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\nDo \na Short Homam You=\r\nrself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcas=\r\nt.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri \n=\r\nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------- \n\n\n\n  ----- Original Me=\r\nssage ----- \n  From: \n  rajarshi \n  nandy \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom \n  \n  Sent: Friday, April 24, 2009 1:53 \nAM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Re: Our \n  Deities and their stories (Deities in different religions!)\n  =\r\n\n    \n    \n      \n        Namaste Utpalji\n        =A0\n        I have had th=\r\ne same experiences. Most of our puranic stories are \n        made fun of by=\r\n others. \n\nWell in most of the cases these questions \n        are of malici=\r\nous intent, those don&#39;t bother me much, but at some point \n        someone =\r\nask&#39;s these questions genuinely.\n        =A0\n        I tried reading differ=\r\nent opinions of different respected saints \n        and I found one explana=\r\ntion in the introuductory chapters on Sri \n        Aurobindo&#39;s &quot;Secrets of =\r\nthe Vedas&quot;.\n        =A0\n        He opines indirectly that the Puranas are d=\r\nefinitely a toned down \n        version of what used to be the Vedic knowle=\r\ndge. This was made this way \n        for the oridinary people to understand=\r\n and not leave the folds of \n        Hinduism. The threat then was Buddhism=\r\n. That is why not only these \n        stories were &quot;made&quot; which were based =\r\non deeper spiritual symbolism \n        generated from the Vedas but even th=\r\ne lagugae was modified and made \n        easier. The sanskrit of the Vedas =\r\nis different from the sanskrit of the \n        puranic age.\n        =A0\n   =\r\n     The reason Buddism could become such a threat to Hinduism was \n       =\r\n because the people (priests)=A0had reducded the Vedas to a book of \n      =\r\n  mere rituals. The Vedas are both internal and external, but the priests \n=\r\n        took over the religion from the sages/mystics and \n        reduced/=\r\nneglected/forgot the internal and=A0relied solely on the \n        external.=\r\n That is why Buddha rejected the Vedas.\n        Infact as per Sri Aurobindo=\r\n, the comng of Buddha was a wrong step \n        in the cycle of evolution. =\r\nHe is not the next automatic choice after \n        Krishna and that, Kalki =\r\nwill recitify the mistake of Buddha.. However, \n        the coming of Buddh=\r\na was in a reverse way, needed to hasten the overall \n        spiritual evo=\r\nlution of this world by increasing the distance between God \n        and ma=\r\nn. \n        =A0\n        So essentially, the Purans were somewhat like comem=\r\nrcial Bollywood \n        movies as compared to the Vedas which were the Art=\r\n films.\n        =A0\n        My personal take on this: As far as they are ab=\r\nle to induce \n        spirituality in an very average ordinary person from =\r\na village they are \n        excellent. But at the same time, if a Hindu who=\r\n is not aware of the \n        comprehensive nature of his own scriptures, a=\r\n poor, uneducated \n        man,=A0is told that his idols are mere stones an=\r\nd his stories are \n        cock and bull whereas God must be necessarily mu=\r\nch beyond all this, the \n        idea of a single God, would be enough reas=\r\non to make him switch \n        religions. It would sound very logical to hi=\r\nm. Infact, this is how it \n        often happens.\n        =A0\n        Solut=\r\nion: I have no clue.

Hence a very important \n          question to answer..\n&gt; \n&gt; To=\r\n answer it, I will go back to \n          the analogy I gave just a few days=\r\n back:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n          wisdom/messag=\r\ne/ 1673 (Why rituals)\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n          \n&gt; The child is taught by par=\r\nents to say things like &quot;thank you&quot; \n          and &quot;sorry&quot; in different sit=\r\nuations. I compared it to engaging in \n          rituals and repeating mant=\r\nras without understanding. I said that the \n          child slowly understa=\r\nnds the true meaning with experience and feels \n          the emotions repr=\r\nesented by those words when saying them.. I compared \n          it to a sad=\r\nhaka experiencing spiritual truths represented by the \n          rituals as=\r\n he gains experience and becomes more ready.\n&gt; \n          \n&gt; Now, think abo=\r\nut this. Parents speaking different languages \n          teach different wo=\r\nrds to the child. A parent speaking English may \n          teach &quot;I am sorr=\r\ny&quot;. A parent speaking Hindi may teach &quot;mujhe maaf \n          keejiye&quot;. Anot=\r\nher Hindi speaking person may teach &quot;mujhe maaf karo&quot;.. A \n          parent=\r\n speaking Telugu may teach &quot;nannu kshaminchandi&quot; . Another \n          Telug=\r\nu speaking person may teach &quot;nannu kshaminchu&quot;. And so on. The \n          w=\r\nords are different. But they represent the same thought and \n          emot=\r\nion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, at one level, the meaning is \n          slightly differ=\r\nent in each case, depending on the peculiarities and \n          cultural co=\r\nntext of the language used. For example, the English \n          expression =\r\nhas &quot;I&quot; as the subject and one is talking about how one \n          feels. T=\r\nhe Hindi and Telugu expressions have the other person as the \n          sub=\r\nject and asking him to forgive. The amount of respect shown is \n          d=\r\nifferent in different expressions. Thus, the exact meaning is \n          sl=\r\nightly different. Thus, children speaking different languages may \n        =\r\n  visualize something slightly different as their understanding of the \n   =\r\n       languages improves. However, these differences are minor. As one \n  =\r\n        delves deeper, the basic emotions associated with these different \n=\r\n          expressions is the same in different languages and one will feel =\r\nthose \n          emotions with compassion as one masters the language.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n          Similarly, deities, rituals and mantras used in different relig=\r\nious \n          traditions may be different, but they may represent the sam=\r\ne divine \n          energy and the same spiritual experiences. Just as the =\r\nimmeidate \n          visualization of an expression in the mind of a child =\r\nmay change based \n          on cultural context and grammar that one is exp=\r\nosed to, the immeidate \n          imagination of a deity&#39;s gross/external f=\r\norm in the mind of a sadhaka \n          may change based on the religious p=\r\naradigms and spirutal context that \n          one is exposed to. However, t=\r\nhese differences are minor. As one delves \n          deeper, the basic ener=\r\ngies and experiences represented by various \n          deities and rituals =\r\nare the same in different religious traditions and \n          one will expe=\r\nrience the same spiritual truths as one masters one&#39;s \n          path.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n No wonder Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa \n          bahudhaa vadanti&quot; (Trut=\r\nh is One, but the learned say it differently) \n          .\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nOne language may have a lot \n          of different words for an object wit=\r\nh slight variation whereas another \n          language may have fewer words=\r\n. As an example, a language spoken near \n          equator may have a singl=\r\ne word for &quot;snow&quot;, &quot;ice&quot;, &quot;dew&quot;, &quot;mist&quot; etc, \n          whereas English has=\r\n so many words. Native language of Alaskans, who \n          live in snow an=\r\nd ice most of the year, has many more words than \n          English for sli=\r\nghtly different kinds of snow, whereas English calls \n          all of them=\r\n as &quot;snow&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, religious \n          traditions that explored s=\r\nlightly different kinds of the same divine \n          energy may have perso=\r\nnified those energies as different deities. So \n          some religions ma=\r\ny have more deities than some other religions. Some \n          religions ma=\r\ny have a lot of deities for different variations of a \n          similar pu=\r\nrpose, whereas another religion may have only one \n          deity.\n&gt; \n&gt; * =\r\n* *\n&gt; \n&gt; If communication can be \n          internalized and we can communi=\r\ncate with our emotions, we do not need \n          language and we will all =\r\nbe on the same page always. But we cannot \n          communicate with our i=\r\nnternal emotions and need an external method. So \n          language is nee=\r\nded. But language can divide.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n          Similarly, spiritual truths a=\r\nre internal (like our emotions).. In order \n          to express them and t=\r\nransmit them to others, we need deities, mantras, \n          rituals and re=\r\nligion. But religion can divide.\n&gt; \n&gt; One \n          child may say &quot;I am so=\r\nrry&quot; and another may say another expression \n          meaning the same thi=\r\nng and they may argue who is right. One may say \n          &quot;my father said =\r\nthis is correct&quot; and another may say &quot;my mother said \n          this is cor=\r\nrect&quot; and they may fight on who is correct. People fighting \n          over=\r\n whose religion is superior and trying to &quot;convert&quot; others are \n          l=\r\nike such children. Unfortunately, my &quot;child and language&quot; analogy is \n     =\r\n     too mild in this area and the fights between religions have been far \n=\r\n          worse than two children arguing about their language. Countless p=\r\neople \n          have been murdered in the name of religion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead \n=\r\n          of arguing which expression is correct and finding fault with oth=\r\ners, \n          children learning should focus on the true meaning of what =\r\nthey saying \n          and try to understand what exactly their expression =\r\nmeans and feel the \n          correct emotions when they say things. Simila=\r\nrly, instead of fighting \n          with others on religion, one should try=\r\n to understand one&#39;s own \n          religion better and experience the spir=\r\nitual truths represented in \n          that religion.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; One m=\r\nay think \n          there is a Christian god, an Islamic god, a Hindu god e=\r\ntc and they are \n          responsible for respective religions and societi=\r\nes. That is not \n          true.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one believes that there is a supre=\r\nme deity \n          (whatever the name you use to describe) who creates all=\r\n beings, then \n          one has to realize that Vyasa, Buddha, Christ, Pro=\r\npher Mohammed and \n          Mahavira were sent to this earth by that same =\r\nsupreme deity and \n          different religions came into being only becau=\r\nse that supreme deity \n          willed so! Each religion serves a useful p=\r\nurpose at a given place and \n          a time. When a religion&#39;s time is up=\r\n, it goes.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * \n          *\n&gt; \n&gt; Some may say that external forms of d=\r\neities who \n          personify different aspects of divine energy running =\r\nthe universe are \n          a creation of the mind. However, they are not a=\r\n creation of the \n          current state of mind. Mind has accumulated man=\r\ny layers of \n          conditioning though many lives. Thus, one may not ha=\r\nve ever seen or \n          thought about or imagined a specific form of a d=\r\neity in this life, but \n          may have a vision of that form, on accoun=\r\nt of conditioning accumulated \n          through many lives. An example is =\r\nthe boy mentioned in the following \n          message:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups. =\r\nyahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n          wisdom/message/ 761\n&gt; \n&gt; He had not read=\r\n about some of \n          the avataras of Vishnu he saw above the fire. But=\r\n he saw them and \n          could describe them. This is because those form=\r\ns represent a \n          personification of a certain energy and his mind i=\r\nmagined that energy \n          in that form in a previous life. The memory =\r\nstayed with the mind \n          (though not consciously) and it can come ba=\r\nck anytime. So, though he \n          did not know about that form, that for=\r\nm appeared before him.\n&gt; \n          \n&gt; Swami Vivekananda famously said (par=\r\naphrased) , &quot;a human \n          being imagines god as a super human being w=\r\nith many hands and heads. \n          If a buffalo imagines god, it may imag=\r\nine god as a super buffalo with \n          many horns&quot;. Though he is right =\r\nin a sense, it is misleading too. It \n          may incorrectly trivialize =\r\nexternal forms. Though external forms are a \n          work of the mind, th=\r\nat does not make them unimportant.\n&gt; \n          \n&gt; Until one learns how to =\r\nfeel sorry and show that feeling, \n          saying &quot;I am sorry&quot; as a ritua=\r\nl is an important habit. Not teaching a \n          child words because he c=\r\nannot anyway understand their correct meaning \n          is wrong. The chil=\r\nd should be taught even if he does not understand. \n          He will under=\r\nstand the true meaning later Similarly, though the energy \n          repres=\r\nented by a form is more basic than a specific external form \n          asso=\r\nciated with that energy, many people will reach that energy only \n         =\r\n by imagining that form and worshipping that form. So, if one&#39;s mind \n     =\r\n     tends to imagine a form, one should imagine the form and worship that =\r\n\n          form.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though we say that forms of deities and \n          my=\r\nstical experiences are a creation of mind, that is in a vedantic \n         =\r\n sense, i.e. the entire manifested universe is a creation of the mind \n    =\r\n      (over many lives). Only Brahman is real and not created by the mind. =\r\n\n          Everything else is a creation of the mind over the time. If we s=\r\nay \n          that a form of a deity or an experience is an imagination of =\r\nthe mind, \n          it does not mean it is a hallucination. Mind is connec=\r\nted to its field \n          of experience. Various minds in its field of ex=\r\nperience are connected \n          to it. For example, the experience descri=\r\nbed in the following message \n          was independently &quot;observed&quot; by two=\r\n people. Human mind can imagine \n          things and hallucinate, but two =\r\nminds observing the same thing is \n          different from a typical hallu=\r\ncination:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n          wisdom/mes=\r\nsage/ 951\n&gt; \n&gt; Most divine forms and divine \n          experiences chronicl=\r\ned in sacred texts of various religions have been \n          independently =\r\nexperienced by multiple people.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * \n          *\n&gt; \n&gt; When someone loo=\r\nks sad, one person may say &quot;he is \n          sad&quot;. Another person may say &quot;=\r\nwoh dukhi hai&quot;. Another person may say \n          &quot;vaadu baadha padutunnaad=\r\nu&quot; . Similarly, when a divine energy is \n          present in a place, one =\r\nmay perceive the energy as deity X and another \n          may perceive it a=\r\ns a deity Y. Just as the expression one uses to \n          describe the fee=\r\nling one perceives is based on the language one knows, \n          similarly=\r\n the form mentioned by one to describe the enegy one \n          perceives d=\r\nepends on the conditioning of one&#39;s mind and the religious \n          tradi=\r\ntion one is exposed to.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know one person who \n          does Chandi h=\r\nomam. When he finishes the homam, he calls back the \n          Divine Mothe=\r\nr into his heart by showing the fire with his hands and \n          motionin=\r\ng the hands towards his heart (with eyes closed). When he does \n          i=\r\nt, he just perceives a nice energy around him and feels peaceful and \n     =\r\n     happy. When he was doing this oneday, a gentleman was visiting and \n  =\r\n        sitting right behind him. His eyes were closed and he was meditatin=\r\ng. \n          When the above happened, he was baffled and opened his eyes t=\r\no see \n          what was going on. He had a vision of a dark goddess who w=\r\nas jumping \n          towards him along with a big pile of kumkum (vermilli=\r\non powder) all \n          around Her. He was overwhelmed by the vision and =\r\nopened his eyes. But \n          the person who did homam perceived only som=\r\ne nice energy and no \n          specific form. Thus, the same energy may be=\r\n perceived by different \n          people in a different form. One person m=\r\nay perceive only some energy \n          and another may perceive a specific=\r\n form. Yet another may perceive a \n          different form. The exact perc=\r\neption is based on the conditioning of \n          the mind. But the energy =\r\nitself is uniform, though the form is \n          not.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; I hav=\r\ne covered various \n          aspects related to this topic.

When other people in the room \nleft, Ramakrishna t=\r\nurned to Balaram and asked him, &quot;Is there anything you want \nto ask me?&quot;&lt;/f=\r\nont&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Balaram asked, &quot;Yes, sir.

Truly I tell you, He \nis e=\r\nxtremely fond of His devotees. He cannot but reveal Himself to them. He \nco=\r\nmes to a person even before He is sought. If a person comes one step toward=\r\ns \nGod, God comes ten steps towards that person.

Try to do that. Then you will find the ans=\r\nwer to your question \nyourself. A theoretical answer is useless. The proof =\r\nof the pudding is in *your* \neating it.

He asked Manish if \nhe was a Hindu. Then he told Manish about how Jesus C=\r\nhrist is the son of the \nreal god, how Hindus are praying to unreal and wro=\r\nng gods and hence doomed and \nhow followers of Jesus Christ will go o heave=\r\nn, etc. Manish asked the person, \n&quot;have you seen god or Jesus Christ&quot;. The =\r\nperson was perplexed and said no. \nManish asked him &quot;how do you then know t=\r\nhat what you say is true? Are you sure \nthat you guys have understood Jesus=\r\n Christ correctly and not misrepresenting his \nteachings now?&quot; Then he&nbsp=\r\n;mentioned calmly and confidently,&nbsp;&quot;Actually, I \n&lt;em&gt;have&lt;/em&gt; seen Je=\r\nsus Christ.. If you want, I can show him to you too. Do you \nwant to see hi=\r\nm?&quot; The missionary looked at him like a crazy person and simply \nran away.&lt;=\r\n/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;See, one who is waxing eloquent about real =\r\ngod, son \nof god and heaven does not even think that it is &lt;em&gt;possible&lt;/em=\r\n&gt; for someone \nto see Jesus Christ. When he was told that somebody saw Jesu=\r\ns and asked if he \nwas interested in seeing, he thought the other person mu=\r\nst be crazy and \njust&nbsp;ran away! He wasn&#39;t even curious to pursue furth=\r\ner and see what the \nother person was upto. He simply concluded the other p=\r\nerson is \ncrazy!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nfont&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;People these days, in many=\r\n religions, have no \nfaith.

He sees and hears \nGandhi while others cannot.

One person who \ndoe=\r\ns Chandi homam everyday called Lord Rama in fire after Chandi homam on a Sr=\r\ni \nRama Navami morning and did a homam to Lord Rama. In the night, he made =\r\nsome \npreparations for the next day&#39;s homam (like he would do every night) =\r\nand laid \nout some dried coconut pieces in homa kundam, on top of previous =\r\nday&#39;s burnt \nashes,&nbsp;for starting fire on the next morning. He then wen=\r\nt to sleep. In the \nmiddle of the night, he woke up. He became aware of his=\r\n body lying on the bed. \nHe then became aware of the homa kundam which was =\r\na few feet away on another \nfloor. It felt like his body and homa kundam we=\r\nre linked. Then it felt like \nsuddenly there was fire in homa kundam and, a=\r\nt the same time, his energy rose. \nAs soon as that happened, he lost &lt;em&gt;re=\r\ngular &lt;/em&gt;awareness of his body. He no \nlonger felt his body or homa kunda=\r\nm or energy in the body. He first felt like he \nlied with head down and leg=\r\ns up and then he became absolutely weightless. Then \nhe felt like he was a =\r\nsmall point, a small particle. It felt like Lord Hanuman \npulled him up and=\r\n he went very fast into a region filled with bright light. He \nwas a weight=\r\nless particle floating in that light along with Lord Hanuman and \nnobody el=\r\nse. He, the small particle,&nbsp;started praying to Lord Hanuman and \nremai=\r\nned in a blissful state for a while.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Sudden=\r\nly, from somewhere, a thought came about his \nbody being in a bedroom and f=\r\nire in homa kundam. He wondered, &quot;was there fire in \nhoma kundam really?&quot; T=\r\nhis disturbed his state and his regular self-awareness \n(i.e. being aware o=\r\nf self as a body) returned.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Aria=\r\nl&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;The interesting=\r\n thing is this. When he went to his \nhoma kundam to do homam next morning, =\r\nhe saw that the dried coconut pieces \nplaced there on the ashes&nbsp;previo=\r\nus night were burnt and completely black. \nIt means there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; inde=\r\ned a fire in the homa kundam. He used the same \nprocedure everyday and plac=\r\ned coconut pieces on the ashes for the next day&#39;s \nhomam before sleeping, b=\r\nut such a thing never happened. Basically, there must \nhave been some ember=\r\n left still from the previous morning, though he did not see \nany ember in =\r\nthe night and thought the fire went out completely. For some \nreason, that =\r\nunseen ember started up a small fire in the night and the coconut \npieces c=\r\naught fire. Though there is no way to know when that happened, it is \nconsi=\r\nstent with what he felt during the mystical experience! After daily homam \n=\r\nfor a long time, a relationship formed between him and the homa kundam. \nMo=\r\nreover, the ember left in homa kundam continued to be linked to his interna=\r\nl \nfire and developments related to it still affected his internal fire and=\r\n \nconsciousness!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nfont&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;When you do homam for a lo=\r\nng time with the mental \nvisualization linking that external fire to your i=\r\nnternal fire, the relationship \n&lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; formed over the time! What happ=\r\nens in that external fire does then \naffect your consciousness. Even if the=\r\n fire goes and ember is left buried under \nthe ash, that ember is still lin=\r\nked to your internal fire!! When something \nhappens in your internal fire, =\r\nthe same thing happens to the ember too. And vice \nversa.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; =\r\nface=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;A=\r\nrial&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Dear Utpal, =\r\none can see God for sure. One can \nexperience God in many forms. One can se=\r\ne god externally, in a limited form like \na human form. One can see god int=\r\nernally, when shakti (energy of self-awareness) \nrises to a specific place =\r\nand becomes aware of beings in that place. One can \nexperience god as an al=\r\nl-pervading light or sound and experience oneself as a \nsmall part of that =\r\nlight or sound. There are many ways to perceive god, but the \nbottomline is=\r\n that god &lt;em&gt;does &lt;/em&gt;exist and one &lt;em&gt;can &lt;/em&gt;perceive god. I \ncannot =\r\nshow you god, but I can guarantee you that god exists and can be \nperceived=\r\n in various forms.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Do homam everyday with s=\r\nincerity.

Most of our puranic stories are \n        made fu=\r\nn of by others. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well in most of the cases these questions \n        =\r\nare of malicious intent, those don&#39;t bother me much, but at some point \n   =\r\n     someone ask&#39;s these questions genuinely.&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;I tried reading different opinions of different respecte=\r\nd saints \n        and I found one explanation in the introuductory chapters=\r\n on Sri \n        Aurobindo&#39;s &quot;Secrets of the Vedas&quot;..&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;He opines in=\r\ndirectly that the Puranas are definitely a toned down \n        version of w=\r\nhat used to be the Vedic knowledge. This was made this way \n        for the=\r\n oridinary people to understand and not leave the folds of \n        Hinduis=\r\nm. The threat then was Buddhism. That is why not only these \n        storie=\r\ns were &quot;made&quot; which were based on deeper spiritual symbolism \n        gener=\r\nated from the Vedas but even the lagugae was modified and made \n        eas=\r\nier. The sanskrit of the Vedas is different from the sanskrit of the \n     =\r\n   puranic age.&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;The reason Buddism could become such a threat to H=\r\ninduism was \n        because the people (priests)&nbsp;had reducded the Ved=\r\nas to a book of \n        mere rituals. The Vedas are both internal and exte=\r\nrnal, but the priests \n        took over the religion from the sages/mystic=\r\ns and \n        reduced/neglected/forgot the internal and&nbsp;relied solely=\r\n on the \n        external. That is why Buddha rejected the Vedas.&lt;/div&gt;\n   =\r\n     &lt;div&gt;Infact as per Sri Aurobindo, the comng of Buddha was a wrong step=\r\n \n        in the cycle of evolution. He is not the next automatic choice af=\r\nter \n        Krishna and that, Kalki will recitify the mistake of Buddha. H=\r\nowever, \n        the coming of Buddha was in a reverse way, needed to haste=\r\nn the overall \n        spiritual evolution of this world by increasing the =\r\ndistance between God \n        and man. &lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;=\r\n face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;So essentially, the Purans=\r\n were somewhat like comemrcial Bollywood \n        movies as compared to the=\r\n Vedas which were the Art films.&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;My personal take on this: As fa=\r\nr as they are able to induce \n        spirituality in an very average ordin=\r\nary person from a village they are \n        excellent. But at the same time=\r\n, if a Hindu who is not aware of the \n        comprehensive nature of his o=\r\nwn scriptures, a poor, uneducated \n        man,&nbsp;is told that his idols=\r\n are mere stones and his stories are \n        cock and bull whereas God mus=\r\nt be necessarily much beyond all this, the \n        idea of a single God, w=\r\nould be enough reason to make him switch \n        religions.. It would soun=\r\nd very logical to him. Infact, this is how it \n        often happens.&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;Solution: I have no clue. Maybe it is time we need to learn our \n      =\r\n  religion better. And the whole host of Babas and Swamis on television \n  =\r\n      would do well to try and educate their followers about the \n        c=\r\nomprehensive/all inclusive&nbsp;nature of Hinduism instead of mere \n       =\r\n reciting the stories from teh Puranas.&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;=\r\n face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n        &lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;\n        &lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;st=\r\nrong&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt; color: navy; font-family: Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; face=3D&quot;Courier&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00007f&quot;&gt;T=\r\nhe upsurge (of \n        consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/font&gt; &lt;/font&gt;- Shiva \n =\r\n       Sutra&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Fri, \n =\r\n       24/4/09, utpal pathak &lt;i&gt;&lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; \n   =\r\n     wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n        &lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16,=\r\n 16, 255); padding-left: 5px; margin-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;From: \n          utpal pat=\r\nhak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] \n          Re=\r\n: Our Deities and their stories (Deities in different \n          religions!=\r\n)&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Friday, 24 \n          April,=\r\n 2009, 10:02 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n          &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2101890818&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;div=\r\n id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n          &lt;div&gt;Namaste Narasimha Garu and friends,&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Rajarshi&#39;s question \n          was in some aspect similar to one question=\r\n i was asked about a month \n          ago. while traveling back to home fro=\r\nm office, one person asked me \n          that what is these stories of our =\r\nGods such as Ganapati and his story \n          of being Shiva&#39;s son and cut=\r\nting of head and replaced by elephant head \n          etc...&lt;br&gt;Stories of =\r\nVishnu and like wise many gods and goddesses.

I said that the \n          child slowly understands the true=\r\n meaning with experience and feels \n          the emotions represented by t=\r\nhose words when saying them.
