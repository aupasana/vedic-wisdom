If ahamkara (identification)\n&gt; evaporates whe=\r\nn chitta (conditioning) is cleaned up, it is normal mukti. If\n&gt; ahamkara (i=\r\ndentification) remains while chitta (conditioning) is cleaned\n&gt; up, it is j=\r\neevanmukti. It is as simple as that.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; If one eng=\r\nages in an action with zero conditioning, then there is no karma\n&gt; and ther=\r\ne are no rinas created. Actions (physical or mental) by themselves\n&gt; do not=\r\n bind one - it is the  *conditioned* actions that bind one! It is the\n&gt; lik=\r\nes, dislikes, desires, agendas etc (i.e. conditioning in chitta) behind\n&gt; a=\r\nn action that bind one!\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; If somebody who is not =\r\nYET a jeevanmukta (but close) identified with a\n&gt; body and engaged in an ac=\r\ntion that IS driven by some conditioning, however\n&gt; subtle or pure or dharm=\r\nik that conditioning may be (!), then that sets in\n&gt; motion the law of kaar=\r\nmik action-reaction which will in due time give a\n&gt; particular reaction to =\r\nwhat one identified with when engaging in that\n&gt; action.\n&gt;\n&gt; By the time th=\r\ne reaction is experienced, all the conditioning may be\n&gt; overcome and one m=\r\nay become jeevanmukta. Yet, the momentum set in motion\n&gt; before one became =\r\njeevanmukta will continue to affect the body, senses and\n&gt; sensory mind, i.=\r\ne. whatever one&#39;s ahamkara is identifying with. But,\n&gt; because there is no =\r\nconditioning and hence no agendas, no desires, no likes\n&gt; and dislikes, one=\r\n neither rejoices nor protests nor tries to modify the\n&gt; happenings to what=\r\n one is identifying with.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Sensing that there is=\r\n a pain requires no conditioning. It is the function\n&gt; of manas, i.e. Chand=\r\nra. Observing that there is more pain in the evening\n&gt; than morning (or whe=\r\nn swallowing) requires no conditioning. It is the\n&gt; function of buddhi, i.e=\r\n. Budha. But thinking of praying to god to reduce\n&gt; pain requires condition=\r\ning in chitta (absent in a jeevanmukta!).\n&gt;\n&gt; Though a jeevanmukta is ident=\r\nifying with a body, one does not view it as\n&gt; something his own and somethi=\r\nng that must be kept in a particular state. He\n&gt; identifies with it, but ha=\r\ns no agendas for it. All that comes from\n&gt; conditioning in chitta, which is=\r\n absent now!\n&gt;\n&gt; The unconditioned identifier (liberated I-ness) views what=\r\n one identifies\n&gt; with as an *amalgam* of portions borrowed from various de=\r\nities (pancha\n&gt; mahabhootas, Moon, Mercury, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Time etc)=\r\n and hence as a\n&gt; manifestation of Light itself. One does not view it from =\r\nthe prism of &quot;this\n&gt; is me, I need to use it to pursue X or Y agenda.&quot; One =\r\nviews it as &quot;this is\n&gt; me. I am made of portions borrowed from various deit=\r\nies, i.e. various\n&gt; manifestations of Light. I observe their play, i.e. wha=\r\nt they do, and I\n&gt; have no agenda pursue using them.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; This is the essen=\r\nce of Upanishads and Yoga Vaasishtham, as well as Mantra\n&gt; Pushpam that we =\r\nwere discussing a while back.\n&gt;\n&gt; I repeat, identification is not the probl=\r\nem. It is the conditioning that\n&gt; drives how one uses what one identifies w=\r\nith, that is the problem.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; I now feel like I hav=\r\ne expressed myself better, though, given how subtle\n&gt; and nuanced this know=\r\nledge is, some people may still get confused (if so,\n&gt; please don&#39;t worry. =\r\nNot a big deal.

Some\n&gt; portions of the Twitter exchange are quoted=\r\n at the end, in chronological\n&gt; order, in case someone is interested in the=\r\n background.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I will answer the following question posed by Manish b=\r\nased on my\n&gt; understanding:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to my mind is this: was=\r\n Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If\n&gt; so, Why did he suffer with throat cancer i=\r\nf he was not identifying with his\n&gt; actions? (according to your interpretat=\r\nion of Vasistha&#39;s definition??)&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let =\r\nme elaborate on my understanding of jeevanmukti. Manish loosely (in\n&gt; my vi=\r\new) said in this exchange that rinas are of body and a jeevanmukta\n&gt; contin=\r\nues to fulfil those rinas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But body is an insentient object. It has=\r\n no rinas. The rinas are not of\n&gt; the body, but of the mind that identifies=\r\n with it. It is the antahkaranas\n&gt; of mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta (=\r\nmemory/conditioning) - that are the\n&gt; source of various rinas, particularly=\r\n chitta. As mind identifies with a\n&gt; body, it projects its rinas on the bod=\r\ny and makes the body &quot;experience&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with tho=\r\nse rinas/conditioning.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the conditioning in chitta is completely =\r\nwiped out and ahamkara\n&gt; merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the cond=\r\nitioning in chitta is\n&gt; completely wiped out and yet ahamkara continues to =\r\nexist with no limiting\n&gt; notions (it is basically the conditioning in chitt=\r\na that is limiting), then\n&gt; one becomes jeevanmukta (liberated while living=\r\n).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Unlike in the case of one who leaves body and gets mukti, a jeev=\r\nanmukta\n&gt; continues to have an I-ness (but which is not limited by any noti=\r\nons or\n&gt; conditioning). This unconditioned I-ness does project into a body.=\r\n But it\n&gt; does not say &quot;I am this body and hence this body should be kept h=\r\nealthy or\n&gt; strong&quot; (THAT would be conditioning in chitta, which is wiped o=\r\nut now!). On\n&gt; the other hand, it does not either say &quot;this body should be =\r\nignored and\n&gt; destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, body keeps exp=\r\neriencing and\n&gt; doing things based on the *momentum* set in motion before o=\r\nne became\n&gt; jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned experiences and actions.=\r\n This is\n&gt; like a fan turning for a while after the electricity has been st=\r\nopped.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep working as they did before. =\r\nIf one has\n&gt; throat cancer, indriyas may sense pain. Manas (sensory/motor m=\r\nind) may\n&gt; process that input and register pain. Buddhi may analyze various=\r\n\n&gt; observations and draw various conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to\n&gt;=\r\n swallow food, it hurts even more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal liquid, i=\r\nt\n&gt; feels better&quot; etc). A normal person whose conditioned mind (chitta) say=\r\ns &quot;I\n&gt; should overcome and not have this pain&quot; may think of various things =\r\nto do\n&gt; and struggle with them. But an unconditioned being has no such\n&gt; co=\r\nnsiderations. Though one may feel and express the pain and other\n&gt; objectiv=\r\ne experiences, one reacts to it differently.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is a key point:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Manas and buddhi are good at making obje=\r\nctive observations and rational\n&gt; deductions, but, by themselves, they do n=\r\not have ANY agenda. They neither\n&gt; like something nor dislike something. TH=\r\nAT comes from the conditioning in\n&gt; chitta! The hallmark of a jeevanmukta i=\r\ns that THAT is absent!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Whether Ramakris=\r\nhna was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A better way\n&gt; to express your qu=\r\nestion is: Can a jeevanmukta get throat cancer and feel\n&gt; pain? How is it p=\r\nossible if there are no karmas or rinas left?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have already answer=\r\ned it. But, let me sum it up briefly again. Body,\n&gt; various body parts, jna=\r\nnendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and buddhi of a\n&gt; jeevanmukta continue to ope=\r\nrate as before. One&#39;s I-ness is intact and does\n&gt; project itself onto those=\r\n. But neither I-ness nor those things carry any\n&gt; rinas or karmas. Chitta -=\r\n the repository of conditioning and rinas - is\n&gt; clean. There are no limiti=\r\nng notions. One&#39;s body, indriyas, manas & buddhi\n&gt; keep experiencing and do=\r\ning things (good or bad!) based on the previous\n&gt; momentum set by the play =\r\nof rnas and karmas while some conditioning was\n&gt; left in chitta.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bo=\r\ndy, various body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma and manas are all\n&gt; por=\r\ntions borrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses sentience\n&gt; =\r\ninto them by projecting awareness into them. The conditioning in chitta is\n=\r\n&gt; what drives how all these are viewed and used. Instead of looking at a\n&gt; =\r\nsense organ as a portion of Indra or Mitra, one views it as &quot;my so and so\n&gt;=\r\n sense organ&quot;, due to conditioning in chitta. That is what creates karmas\n&gt;=\r\n and rinas. When that conditioning is *completely* overcome, ahamkara can\n&gt;=\r\n still project awareness into those objects, but it sees them for what they=\r\n\n&gt; are. It does not have false and limiting notions like &quot;this throat is mi=\r\nne\n&gt; and MUST feel nice and not feel painful&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Most people who may claim to be (or think they are) jeevanmuktas ar=\r\ne not\n&gt; really jeevanmuktas in today&#39;s world.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one wants to under=\r\nstand the state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham is\n&gt; the best book. The en=\r\ntire discourse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama is a\n&gt; detailed and elabo=\r\nrate definition and characterization of a jeevanmukta.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There may be=\r\n other books that explain better how to do various sadhanas\n&gt; to progress s=\r\npiritually and get closer to being liberated oneday. But, when\n&gt; it comes e=\r\nlaborating what liberation while living actually is, there is\n&gt; none better=\r\n than Yoga Vaasishtham. Of course, one can say that this is\n&gt; merely an int=\r\nellectual exercise as far as *we* are concerned. It perhaps\n&gt; is, as none o=\r\nf may ever become a jeevanmukta..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One word of caution: I write with=\r\n a very confident tone when I have\n&gt; strong conviction in what I write. Tha=\r\nt is how I am. But I can definitely\n&gt; be wrong. So please feel free to igno=\r\nre me! :-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best r=\r\negards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n&gt; &gt;  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotis=\r\nh Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri T=\r\narpana:\n&gt; &gt;                   *http://www.VedicAstrologer.org*&lt;http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org&gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Films that make a difference: *http://Saraswati=\r\nFilms.org*&lt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&gt;\n&gt; &gt;     Spirituality: *http://groups.=\r\nyahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom*&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;  Jyotish writings: *http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings*&lt;http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;\n&gt; &gt;                     Twitter I=\r\nD: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Twitter exchange on jeevanmukta between Manish (twitter h=\r\nandle\n&gt; @mmpandit) and Narasimha (twitter handle @homam108):\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Manish=\r\n: So, what is a jeevanmukta doing here?

If no, y r they called rnas? =\r\nIf yes, y call him mukta?\n&gt; &gt; Manish: No, rnas will work out themselves, sl=\r\nowly or fast as may be the\n&gt; case. The rnas are of the body he or she occup=\r\nies. He is mukta because he\n&gt; experiences, actually sees the rnas to be the=\r\n body&#39;s only. Rnas apply to\n&gt; the body, not to you. You are that &quot;speck of =\r\neffulgent light&quot;, call it what\n&gt; you want, Atma, etc.\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha: Well, =\r\nthat speck of effulgent light was never bound. So, who\n&gt; exactly bcame &quot;muk=\r\nta&quot;? Did & does he/it have rnas?

The mind thought, that, it was the body, instead\n&gt; of this=\r\n light. That is the original problem. Which every being is born\n&gt; with. Rna=\r\ns arise from this identification which creates karma. U r not\n&gt; that, so u =\r\nr not bound, when the mind realises this.

When\n&gt; a mind identifies with li=\r\nght & bcomes mukta, does it hv rnas left?\n&gt; &gt; Manish: Ok, karmas projected =\r\ninto mind, are acted on and may be\n&gt; experienced by body. So, why is a jeev=\r\nanmukta subject to this? because,\n&gt; that person although aware of the light=\r\n at all times, and of the causal n\n&gt; subtle bodies, has not yet directed d =\r\nmind to identify as that light at all\n&gt; times, key word being &quot;all&quot;. This g=\r\nives karmas time to work. Next stage is\n&gt; 24/7 id with light\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha:=\r\n As per my understanding, the person u r defining is not a\n&gt; jeevanmukta. H=\r\ne may b an elevated being, but not mukta (liberated) yet.\n&gt; &gt; Manish: I der=\r\nive that definition of this &quot;state&quot; from somebody, no\n&gt; problem in disagree=\r\nment. 24/7 identification with light, most likely body\n&gt; should not exist, =\r\nno?\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha: Id with light forever with body dropping off is just muk=\r\nti,\n&gt; not jivanmukti! Jivanmukti is where body stays. Is body really differ=\r\nent\n&gt; from light? In fact, is there anything other than light? Jivanmukti i=\r\ns\n&gt; seeing the play of objects but seeing all as light. Mukti & rna are\n&gt; c=\r\nontradictory concepts & cant coexist. U rnt &quot;free&quot; till u pay back what u\n&gt;=\r\n owe. And that means u dont owe anybody anything once u r truly free. Words=\r\n\n&gt; like free, liberated & jivanmukta r often misused.\n&gt; &gt; Manish: Will expl=\r\nain a bit in detail sometime.\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha: OK. :-) But, as far as &quot;explai=\r\nning&quot; is concerned, Vasishtha\n&gt; explained as clearly & elaborately as any h=\r\numan being can ever hope 2.\n&gt; &gt; Manish: The question to my mind is this: wa=\r\ns Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta?\n&gt; If so, Why did he suffer with throat cancer =\r\nif he was not identifying with\n&gt; his actions? (according to your interpreta=\r\ntion of Vasistha&#39;s definition??)\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha: Vasishtha didnt give a sing=\r\nle definition. His entire\n&gt; discourse 2 Rama is a definition of jeevanmukta=\r\n! Will answer ur RK qn\n&gt; later.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--e89a8f5036c8fde24f04b9635703\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nDear Sirs,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I do not know whether this is relevant to the=\r\n discussion below or not but I am reminded of Lahiri Mahasaya&#39;s cryptic=\r\n statement: &quot;...the body has to find some reason to go&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Is it possible that a jivanmukti can choose to let some a=\r\nctions identify with the body?=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;best regards&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;Hari&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Sun, Feb 19, 2012 at 9:55 =\r\nPM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr@charter.n=\r\net&quot;&gt;pvr@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_qu=\r\note&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n\n\n&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color:#fff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEF=\r\nT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;=A0Namaste Manish,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;I did actual=\r\nly answer you.

Manish loosely (in=\r\n my view) said in this exchange that rinas are of body and a jeevanmukta co=\r\nntinues to fulfil those rinas. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=\r\n=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;L=\r\nEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; But body is a=\r\nn insentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not of the body, but of=\r\n the mind that identifies with it. It is the antahkaranas of mind - ahamkar=\r\na (I-ness) and chitta (memory/conditioning) - that are the source of variou=\r\ns rinas, particularly chitta. As mind identifies with a body, it projects i=\r\nts rinas on the body and makes the body &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do=\r\n&quot; things, in accordance with those rinas/conditioning. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=\r\n=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; If the conditioning in chitta is completely wiped out and=\r\n ahamkara merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the conditioning in chi=\r\ntta is completely wiped out and yet ahamkara continues to exist with no lim=\r\niting notions (it is basically the conditioning in chitta that is limiting)=\r\n, then one becomes jeevanmukta (liberated while living). &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;/=\r\nfont&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#=\r\n000000&quot;&gt;&gt; Unlike in the case of one who leaves body and gets mukti, a je=\r\nevanmukta continues to have an I-ness (but which is not limited by any noti=\r\nons or conditioning). This unconditioned I-ness does project into a body. B=\r\nut it does not say &quot;I am this body and hence this body should be kept =\r\nhealthy or strong&quot; (THAT would be conditioning in chitta, which is wip=\r\ned out now!). On the other hand, it does not either say &quot;this body sho=\r\nuld be ignored and destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, body=\r\n keeps experiencing and doing things based on the *momentum* set in motion =\r\nbefore one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned experiences and ac=\r\ntions. This is like a fan turning for a while after the electricity has bee=\r\nn stopped. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D=\r\n&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;V=\r\nerdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep w=\r\norking as they did before. If one has throat cancer, indriyas may sense pai=\r\nn. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may process that input and register pain. Bud=\r\ndhi may analyze various observations and draw various conclusions (e.g. &qu=\r\not;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurts even more&quot;, &quot;when=\r\n I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels better&quot; etc). A normal perso=\r\nn whose conditioned mind (chitta) says &quot;I should overcome and not have=\r\n this pain&quot; may think of various things to do and struggle with them. =\r\nBut an unconditioned being has no such considerations. Though one may feel =\r\nand express the pain and other objective experiences, one reacts to it diff=\r\nerently. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3=\r\n&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Ver=\r\ndana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; * =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0* =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0*=\r\n &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=\r\n=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; =\r\nsize=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; This is a key point: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div al=\r\nign=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;/fon=\r\nt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000=\r\n000&quot;&gt;&gt; Manas and buddhi are good at making objective observations and ra=\r\ntional deductions, but, by themselves, they do not have ANY agenda. They ne=\r\nither like something nor dislike something. THAT comes from the conditionin=\r\ng in chitta! The hallmark of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is absent! &lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#00000=\r\n0&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; =\r\ncolor=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; * =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0* =A0 =A0 =A0 =A0* &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\n/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D=\r\n&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A =\r\nbetter way to express your question is: Can a jeevanmukta get throat cancer=\r\n and feel pain? How is it possible if there are no karmas or rinas left? &lt;/=\r\nfont&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;=\r\n#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; I have already answered it. But, let me sum i=\r\nt up briefly again. Body, various body parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, ma=\r\nnas and buddhi of a jeevanmukta continue to operate as before. One&#39;s I-=\r\nness is intact and does project itself onto those. But neither I-ness nor t=\r\nhose things carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta - the repository of condition=\r\ning and rinas - is clean. There are no limiting notions. One&#39;s body, in=\r\ndriyas, manas &amp; buddhi keep experiencing and doing things (good or bad!=\r\n) based on the previous momentum set by the play of rnas and karmas while s=\r\nome conditioning was left in chitta. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div alig=\r\nn=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;&gt; Body, v=\r\narious body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma and manas are all portions b=\r\norrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses sentience into them=\r\n by projecting awareness into them. The conditioning in chitta is what driv=\r\nes how all these are viewed and used. Instead of looking at a sense organ a=\r\ns a portion of Indra or Mitra, one views it as &quot;my so and so sense org=\r\nan&quot;, due to conditioning in chitta. That is what creates karmas and ri=\r\nnas. When that conditioning is *completely* overcome, ahamkara can still pr=\r\noject awareness into those objects, but it sees them for what they are.
