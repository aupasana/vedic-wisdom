How=\r\never one last question lingers in my mind...\n\nIf a person truly does an act=\r\n without an sense of emotion attached or I ness as mentioned by you and doe=\r\ns not create any fresh karma ..\n\nThis also explains to me the actions of th=\r\ne Great Trailing Swami who performs a puja to Kashi Vishweswara with his ow=\r\nn offal as mentioned in book1 and yet Shiva does not punish him. Also the g=\r\nreat Gajanan maharaj&#39;s actions on similar lines which I read from Pandit ji=\r\n&#39;s website.\n\nIn the case of an solider on the battlefield this above theory=\r\n clarifies a lot because the soldier is only performing his duty and there =\r\nis a good chance in certain cases he will act emotionlessly...Eg: He sees a=\r\n wounded enemy ...if given an order he will still go for the kill and do hi=\r\ns predetermined dharma.Seen from an outsiders moral tinted lens all the abo=\r\nve actions will seem wrong...\n\nNow if the needle is flipped to the other ex=\r\ntreme...If an killer does an murder cold bloodedly without emotion....say a=\r\ns an contract killing and years of killing has hardened his nerves and he n=\r\no longer feels emotions..he is simply doing it as an job...\n\nWould this mea=\r\nn he is also not incurring karma ...\n\n\nPlease forgive my repeated childish =\r\nquestions, just trying to clarify some things for my understanding thats al=\r\nl.\n\nPranams\n\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

It is no doubt as you said writt=\r\nen by a great being . Vimalananda in his book mentions three karmas which c=\r\nannot be easily gotten rid of and are very terrible by nature and might tak=\r\ne an immense amount of lifetimes to even clear.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The two I rememb=\r\ner are Killing of one&#39;s guru and rape . \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Now the doubt that has =\r\narisen in my mind is this\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1.How do we know whether a thing that =\r\nis happening now is an reaction to an past action or a fresh action being s=\r\net forth in this lifetime...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The learned gurujan&#39;s on the board =\r\nmight question ..Is there really a use by knowing that since either way the=\r\n action is taking place and cannot be stopped.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The reason I ask =\r\nthis is  ...the mother goddess is described as\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot; Ati Soumyati Ro=\r\nudrayai Nathastasyai namo namah &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; She is the most pleasing among=\r\n beautiful things and the most ferocious among terrible things ...There is =\r\nno relative scale of good or bad for nature ( Ramarkrishna&#39; s parable of De=\r\nvi Kali bringing up a child and killing it ) ....I fully understand good or=\r\n bad exists only in the human mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; But if a certain act right n=\r\now is not happening as a reaction to a past act... What on earth can possib=\r\nly cause a person to do such a severe act.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; :( And how should o=\r\nne console a person who has undergone such a punishment.. ..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; One=\r\n more reason for me asking this is ...A lot of great gurus have always said=\r\n &quot; Whatever happening in the world right now is Mangala and the very form o=\r\nf Shiva himself &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; How can I reconcile such acts of violence happ=\r\nening in this kali yuga as Mangala especially some of the henious acts ....=\r\nwhich brings back my original question...Are these happening more in number=\r\n in kali yuga as a reaction of the souls who needed this punishment being b=\r\norn in greater numbers now...or are these a fresh set of acts.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n do not know whether my questions would make sense.
