Grammar i=\r\ns learned in 12 years. What point is there in starting the study on the dea=\r\nth-bed? This doesn&#39;t mean that vyAkaraNam shouldn&#39;t be studied at all. \n\n\n\n=\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt;\n&gt; namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dont blame the system - it is the you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Good gene=\r\nral advice.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I hve the entire word by word tolkappIyam in analyzable =\r\nformat ... to see the real truths in the Aryan - Dravidian divide This shou=\r\nld have been done by scholars or myself years ago -\n&gt; \n&gt; You might want to =\r\nlook into the works of the International Institute\n&gt; of Tamil Studies, base=\r\nd in Chennai. They have done a bunch of research\n&gt; comparing and contrastin=\r\ng the Tolkappiyam & Paniniyam grammar. I do\n&gt; not know anything about this,=\r\n but it is certainly an interesting area\n&gt; of study.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dedicated to th=\r\ne Adi sha~gkara ... with is comment on vyAkarNa\n&gt; &gt; his &quot;ai giri...&quot; cannot=\r\n be understand if you don&#39;t know what &quot;ai&quot; is\n&gt; \n&gt; Firstly, on this tangent=\r\n -- to be best of my knowledge, the\n&gt; mahishAsura-mardini stotram is not a =\r\ncomposition of Adi shankara. I do\n&gt; not see it in the Vani Vilas edition of=\r\n his woks. It is possible that\n&gt; the composer was someone named Ramakrishna=\r\n Kavi.\n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly, on point. In my opinion, Adi shankara made no comment=\r\n\n&gt; towards you, or towards any vaiyAkaraNa regarding vyAkaraNa. A little\n&gt; =\r\nbit of logic shows a lot of myth surrounding his moha-mudgara-stotra\n&gt; (lat=\r\ner rebranded as bhaja-govinda). The rumour-mill account, which is\n&gt; taken a=\r\ns the absolute truth says that Adi shankara saw an old man\n&gt; trying to star=\r\nt learning grammar by memorizing the dhAtu-pAtha, and\n&gt; out of pity, he ins=\r\ntructed him by spontaneously composing 12 verses.\n&gt; The remaining verses ar=\r\ne said to be later additions.\n&gt; \n&gt; (a) It is difficult to justify the compo=\r\nsition of the 2nd verse\n&gt; (muuDha jahiihi) and especially difficult to just=\r\nify the composition\n&gt; of the 3rd verse (nArii-stana) as an upadesha to an o=\r\nld man. If we\n&gt; assume that aspects of the traditional account are true, it=\r\n is much\n&gt; more likely that he recited these verses to his own sannyAsii st=\r\nudents\n&gt; to cultivate vairAgya in them. Assuming that you are a non-sannyAs=\r\nii,\n&gt; there&#39;s no reason to get riled up about advice that is not primarily\n=\r\n&gt; directed at you.\n&gt; \n&gt; (b) Adi shankara is said to have composed the first=\r\n 12 stanzas,\n&gt; following which, many of his students composed single verses=\r\n that have\n&gt; been now been compiled together. It is pretty unlikely that Ad=\r\ni\n&gt; shankara would have had his disciples (young and old) gang up on an\n&gt; o=\r\nld man. It also seems unlikely that his students would have added\n&gt; onto a =\r\nwork that was composed for someone else&#39;s benefit. In a\n&gt; satsanga of rishi=\r\ns, everyone waits for the main rishi to speak. On the\n&gt; other hand, assume =\r\nthat this advice was composed and imparted to his\n&gt; own students. It is mor=\r\ne likely that his students might add onto this\n&gt; kind of work. Again, there=\r\n is no reason for you to get riled up about\n&gt; advice that is not primarily =\r\ndirected at you.\n&gt; \n&gt; (c) In the best case, the first verse (bhaja govindam=\r\n) merely provides\n&gt; the context. At worst, it is a later addition. The moha=\r\n-mudgara\n&gt; consists of verses 1-12. Let us take the first verse as a\n&gt; mang=\r\nala-shloka, rather than excluding it altogether. This stotram is a\n&gt; work o=\r\nf contemplation. Though Adi shankara is a master bhakta, this\n&gt; work is not=\r\n a good example of bhakti. The older name of the stotram\n&gt; (moha mudgara =\r\n=3D hammering delusion), is much more reflective of the\n&gt; work that the pop=\r\nular name (bhaja govindam). Across his works, Adi\n&gt; shankara is clear about=\r\n people needing different solutions at\n&gt; different points in their spiritua=\r\nl life. First, they need karma +\n&gt; upAsana, and only later should they purs=\r\nue viveka. Thus, the advice in\n&gt; his stotra is intended primarily for a dif=\r\nferent crowd. It is unlikely\n&gt; that he would have given this advice to some=\r\n random stranger. There is\n&gt; no reason for you to get riled up about advice=\r\n that is not primarily\n&gt; directed at you.\n&gt; \n&gt; (d) Now, let us assume that =\r\nthe rumour-mill account is true. As you\n&gt; have noted, Adi shankara&#39;s compos=\r\nitions are composed in sanskrit.\n&gt; Further, it is clear that he is extremel=\r\ny well-versed in grammar. So,\n&gt; any conclusion that he is anti-grammar seem=\r\ns strange, and is wrong.\n&gt; There is no reason to get riled up over this.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; (e) His sampradAya safeguards grammar. Just as one example, vyAkaraNa\n&gt; =\r\nis a regular topic of discourse in the yearly vAkyArtha-sabhA at\n&gt; sringeri=\r\n. It is the same institution that is publishing, and\n&gt; re-publishing variou=\r\ns grammatical works. His own disciples, who adorn\n&gt; this peeTha, are great =\r\nscholars of vyAkaraNa. Adi shankara, and his\n&gt; sampradAya are clearly not a=\r\nnti-grammar. In fact, they are clearly\n&gt; pro-grammar. So, there is nothing =\r\nto get riled up about.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, let us take the &quot;bhaja govindam&quot; verse at =\r\nface value. I still\n&gt; don&#39;t see the problem --\n&gt; \n&gt; That there is no point =\r\nin studying the dhAtu-pATha on the death-bed.\n&gt; This makes sense. &quot;dvAdasha=\r\n-varShaiH shruuyate vyAkaraNam&quot;. Grammar is\n&gt; learned in 12 years. What poi=\r\nnt is there in starting the study on the\n&gt; death-bed? This doesn&#39;t mean tha=\r\nt vyAkaraNam shouldn&#39;t be studied at\n&gt; all. All it means is that desha-kAla=\r\n-pAtra should be taken into\n&gt; account. And, if you want to take things lite=\r\nrally, Adi shankara said\n&gt; nothing about grammar in general. In this verse,=\r\n all he talked about\n&gt; was the dhAtu-pATha in particular.\n&gt; \n&gt; People who t=\r\nruly study the dhAtu pATha these days are rare, and I\n&gt; would expect a disp=\r\nroportionate number of them to consider Adi\n&gt; shankara as their guru.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nbhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; \n&gt; =EF=BF=BD =EF=BF=BDajit\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
