The reason we are not =\r\nable to perceive God is not that God is not there, but, given our current w=\r\nay of thinking, he can not be perceived. By Sadhana, you are trying to calm=\r\n your mind and infact, make your current knowledge influence irrelavent whi=\r\nch allows you to percieve thing you can not otherwise.\n\nThere are 4 known m=\r\nargas for self realisation. My understanding of any of these limited.\n1. Bh=\r\nakthi - Surrender to God. Here you rest all other thoughts but for thought =\r\npertaining to God. You do not question any thing related to him and give-in=\r\n completely to the believe that he is there and is your master. By doing so=\r\n, you are coming out of the clutches of the regular perceptions or dimentio=\r\nns of this material world.\n\n2. Raja - You focus on doing specific postures =\r\nand concentrate deeply on the way you do things and draw your self away fro=\r\nm the regular senses.\n\n3. Karma - Unattached karma. If you can do it, you a=\r\nre not even thinking about God, but, have got him.\n\n4. jnana - By questioni=\r\nng available information, using logic and try to break out of current assum=\r\nptions and try to discover. Saying, this will not yield results is not a wi=\r\nse thing. How ever, perhaps, this is the most defficult. But, with so many =\r\nothers who are experiancing God, not sure, why the wrong in current axioms =\r\ncan not be corrected. Unfortunately, those who are realised, do not perhaps=\r\n think it is relavent.\n\nThere is a soul. Now is Soul physical or not? Can i=\r\nt be seen? If not with naked eyes, to see it materialistically, what is nee=\r\nded?\n\nWe can see the difference between a body with prana and with out pran=\r\na. Can&#39;t we? Then, why can we try to narrow our focus and try to see prana/=\r\natma sceintifically? I am not for this path, but, to say, that is not a pat=\r\nh, is perhaps unfair to all those who are destine to traverse that path.\nBe=\r\nst regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;raja=\r\nrshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; With all due respect to your q=\r\nuery, I wanted to ask, how does it matter?

I=\r\n have heard differing opinions though, perhaps in Sanjay Rathji&#39;s Brhat Nak=\r\nshtra but since I dont have the book in front of me, I cant confirm.
