However, as they have a huge \n&gt; reper=\r\ntoire of things they can give and a nice judgment on what is good \n&gt; for yo=\r\nu, they may or may not give you what you asked for right away. \n&gt; They may =\r\ngive you something else that is better for you (from the \n&gt; perspective of =\r\nthat deity - this can change from one deity to another, \n&gt; but all deities =\r\nhave much better judgment than you!). Or, they may first \n&gt; give you some r=\r\nesponsibilities that prepare you for using what you asked \n&gt; for well, and =\r\ngive you what you asked for later.\n&gt; \n&gt; In comparison, lower beings such as=\r\n Yakshas and Yakshinis have dominion \n&gt; over specific things and they give =\r\nthem to you if they are pleased. When \n&gt; you approach them, you are taking =\r\nextra responsibility for what you are \n&gt; asking for and the consequences of=\r\n getting it. It may work faster, but \n&gt; comes with a risk. It may even comp=\r\nromise your spiritual progress. Most \n&gt; of these sadhanas will be hidden or=\r\n corrupted as Kali yuga progresses. \n&gt; With sadhana of higher deities, thin=\r\ngs may not work too fast or be too \n&gt; straight-forward, but there is less r=\r\nisk.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Feb 25, 2012 at 5:46 PM, Bhupend=\r\nra Jamnadas wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the purpose of K=\r\nubera homa?
