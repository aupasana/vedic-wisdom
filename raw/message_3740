wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Prana=\r\nm Guruji,\n&gt; and to all my seniors,\n&gt; \n&gt; i just want to share few of my expe=\r\nriences that i am undergoing and wish to share it with all of my respected =\r\nfellow friends in here.. i with three other friends of mine have visited Ve=\r\nnaras (kashi) during the last week of January 2010. we visited the Manikarn=\r\nika shamshan and all possible temples that we had planned to visit.. just b=\r\nefore going there i had a set frame of mind=A0 that when i will come back t=\r\no home .. in Kolkata (Calcutta) i&#39;ll be starting Maha Ganapati=A0 homam.. a=\r\ntleast in the weekends if not .. regularly as i was having a very bad situa=\r\ntion both financially and in the home front as well .. i brought a Baneshwa=\r\nr from there as well. while coming back to home i was severely ill and was =\r\nhaving Fever with stomach upset as well... i didnt bother much about my hea=\r\nlth as i had a feeling may be its coz of the past bad karmas i am facing it=\r\n ..since i have been lucky enough in getting guidance from two of Manish ji=\r\n&#39;s direct disciples.. my friend who\n&gt;  have been doing Ganapati homam for q=\r\nuite a long time and now he is doing Chandi homam.. showed me how to do it =\r\n,,and there again i met another friend of mine who is regular in doing Chan=\r\ndi homams who inspired me to start as well... i was very tensed to start of=\r\nf as i didnt had even that much of money to start off regularly.. and there=\r\n again i was a bit tensed about how my parents would react to the things li=\r\nke .. i am turning out to be a veg and will be doing homams on a regular ba=\r\nsis.. where as my income was nil at that time .. !!\n&gt; \n&gt; now comes the supr=\r\nises as follows:-\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Manish ji=A0 called up my friend who was staying =\r\nin my home ,who was staying in my home .. after we had returned .. from Ven=\r\naras..\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) I was so happy and excited about the fact that without even =\r\nknowing .. how .. i just took the decision .. that i am going to start ..my=\r\n Homams DAILY.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) To my=A0 very surprise.. my parents did not objected=\r\n, to my decision of doing Homams on a regular basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) The very 1st d=\r\nay i did my homam.. i got a call for regular work.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) By profession i =\r\nam an Actor / Anchor .. so i dont have any permanent salaried job..it impli=\r\nes of a inconsistent income .. now .. i get calls for a lot works regularly=\r\n .. \n&gt; \n&gt; 6) My mom started to recite Chandi ..path regularly and the bigge=\r\nst of all suprises.. my Dad who never was so much into spirituality is star=\r\nting Saptashloki Chandi path .,,\n&gt; \n&gt; 7) In total.. i got very fast results=\r\n ..of my homams..and was lucky and blessed enough to help two others to sta=\r\nrt Ganapati homams regularly ..all the problems that i have been facing for=\r\n a long time .. does not exists right now .. at all... \n&gt; \n&gt; Right now .. i=\r\n am preparing . for Chandi homam.. and trying to my best of possibilities..=\r\n to read the 13 chapters of Chandi fluently ..\n&gt; \n&gt; now i have a question t=\r\no my respected seniors...\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) i am happy that my monetary problem .. is=\r\n solving very fast .. but in no way i was, nor am i now .. attached to the =\r\nmundane.. and earthly materialistic desires...so i am a bit confused.. that=\r\n getting earthly benefits ..without even asking for it.. in the homam.. hop=\r\ne is not a way or a procedure.. to deviate me .. from.. the sadhana.. i mea=\r\nn getting very fast results from .. the homam.. is it a way God is testing =\r\nme ????\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) plz do correct me ,.., if at any place .. i am wrong and in=\r\ncorrect ,., \n&gt; \n&gt; i beg of mercy .. if i have said anything wrong .. i dont=\r\n know much . and just a beginner.. its just my devotion and faith are all t=\r\nhat i have.. while doing my homams..and i am sure .. i do a plenty of mista=\r\nkes in my steps.. while doing the homam..but i am thankful that God has bee=\r\nn merciful enough to forgive me and bless...i am enjoying my state of bliss=\r\n..and after a very long search .. i think this is=A0 the right way meant fo=\r\nr ..me .. my life has changed..and i hope it will be the same or even more.=\r\n. for the new friends who are yet to come.. i did three homams at a stretch=\r\n today for the 1st time and i am happy for that fact very much ,, \n&gt; Despit=\r\ne of the factor. that i havent been lucky enough . to meet or even to inter=\r\nact with =A0 Manish ji ..=A0 i think of him as my Guru .. and i feel blesse=\r\nd at all times..\n&gt; and a special thanks to Rajarshi da and Arnab ,, \n&gt;
