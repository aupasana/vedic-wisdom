This=\r\n is the first attempt and can evolve over time.\n&gt;\n&gt; The goal is to enable a=\r\ns many people as possible to approach the\ndivine\n&gt;\n&gt; via the sacred medium =\r\nof fire.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; A few months back, Manish sat =\r\nnext to an American lady in a flight.\nHis\n&gt;\n&gt; intuition told him to tell he=\r\nr a few things. He told her a few things\n&gt;\n&gt; that would happen in the next =\r\nfew months. He told her she MUST do a\nfire\n&gt;\n&gt; ritual regularly to overcome=\r\n some serious problems in her life. He\nalso\n&gt;\n&gt; gave her his email address.=\r\n She told me later that she thought he was\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;insane&quot; to talk to a strang=\r\ner like that. Later, when some specific\n&gt;\n&gt; things happened as told by Mani=\r\nsh, some to the day, she developed\ntrust\n&gt;\n&gt; in Manish (Manish told me he w=\r\nas just acting on his intuition\nwithought\n&gt;\n&gt; knowing why). She emailed him=\r\n and later talked to him. Manish\n&gt;\n&gt; re-iterated to her that she MUST do fi=\r\nre ritual to overcome current\nand\n&gt;\n&gt; future problems and he put her in tou=\r\nch with me.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; I gave her the Mahaganapati homam manual, but it was Gr=\r\neek and Latin\nto\n&gt;\n&gt; her. She is a practicing Christian and does not know m=\r\nuch about\n&gt;\n&gt; Hinduism. She was totally lost in in the manual and could not=\r\n put it\nto\n&gt;\n&gt; use, though she really wanted to do a fire ritual. I spent a=\r\nn hour on\n&gt;\n&gt; phone with her and explained a simple procedure that she coul=\r\nd relate\n&gt;\n&gt; to, remember and do. She did homam a few times and found it to=\r\n have a\n&gt;\n&gt; soothing and calming influence, though she was very nervous, af=\r\nraid\nand\n&gt;\n&gt; tense when she started out. Another friend of her, also a prac=\r\nticing\n&gt;\n&gt; Christian with open-mindedness to other practices, was also inte=\r\nrested\n&gt;\n&gt; in trying fire ritual and asked for info. This made me think of\n=\r\nwriting\n&gt;\n&gt; a manual suitable for a group currenly left out.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *     =\r\n   *        *\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Coincidentally, Manish, I and a few other friends had=\r\n a discussion a\n&gt;\n&gt; month back about non-Hindus performing fire ritual. Tho=\r\nugh some\nsincere\n&gt;\n&gt; and learned friends had reservations, I opined: &quot;If on=\r\ne cannot relate\nto\n&gt;\n&gt; a Sanskrita mantra and can relate to a Latin or Gree=\r\nk or Arabic chant,\nI\n&gt;\n&gt; see no problem in offering that to god. I do not r=\r\neally think Agni\nwill\n&gt;\n&gt; say &quot;I do not know that god and cannot carry the =\r\noffering to that\ngod&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; I do not see gods as Hindu gods and non-Hindu go=\r\nds and see all of them\n&gt;\n&gt; as personifications of various natures and quali=\r\nties inherent to us. I\n&gt;\n&gt; reckon that Agni is capable of translating. Thus=\r\n, I am not averse to\n&gt;\n&gt; enabling non-Hindus to do a fire ritual by essenti=\r\nally retaining the\n&gt;\n&gt; basic homam structure, but replacing the main mantra=\r\n of pradhaana\nhomam\n&gt;\n&gt; section with a non-Sanskrit sacred chant.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nI had copied Sri Robert Svoboda (author of Aghora series on\nVimalananda)\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; on that discussion. He put his view on record in a private email:\n&quot;Just\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; for the record, my view is very similar to yours =E2=80&quot; the\nimportant t=\r\nhing\n&gt;\n&gt; is to create a relationship with fire, and via the fire, with Brah=\r\nman,\n&gt;\n&gt; Nirguna or Saguna =E2=80&quot; Saguna being much easier. There are many=\r\n\ndevatas in\n&gt;\n&gt; the world, and I too do not really think Agni will say &quot;I d=\r\no not know\n&gt;\n&gt; that god and cannot carry the offering to that god&quot;.
