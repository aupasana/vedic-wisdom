In some paramparas, specially in North India, it is=\r\n consider to be equal \n&gt;&gt;to the Saptasati. Where as in eastern India, Benga=\r\nl/Assam areas, and also some \n&gt;&gt;Kaula sampradayas in Varanasi, this is not =\r\nconsidered to be equal to Saptasati. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;The reasons why these samprad=\r\nayas do not consider KS to be equal to Saptasati is \n&gt;&gt;the same as what Nar=\r\nasimha stated. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;In my personal experience, about a year before I=\r\n actually started reading the \n&gt;&gt;full Saptasati, I used to do the KS for a =\r\nfew months. I was shown a specific \n&gt;&gt;method of chanting the KS - there is =\r\nsome breath control required at certain \n&gt;&gt;lines etc etc. I had almost mugg=\r\ned it up. But the experience of chanting the \n&gt;&gt;actual Saptashati (full) is=\r\n vastly more powerful and different than the KS. I \n&gt;&gt;have serious doubts w=\r\nhether a person doing only the KS can ever experience \n&gt;&gt;samadhi at all; wh=\r\nereas the Saptasati by itself is capable of bestowing the \n&gt;&gt;highest and va=\r\nried types of spiritual experiences to a sadhaka. Therefore, I \n&gt;&gt;tend to a=\r\ngree with the sampradayas from Bengal and Assam that the actual \n&gt;&gt;Saptasat=\r\ni is anytime more powerful than the KS when it comes to spiritual \n&gt;&gt;experi=\r\nences. KS is about siddhis. That too, not a simple straight chanting but \n&gt;=\r\n&gt;with some modulations, breath controls etc etc which have to be learnt fro=\r\nm \n&gt;&gt;someone qualified.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Just my 2 cents on the topic.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;-Regards\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n Rajarshi\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;shashi_nambis=\r\nan&quot; &lt;shashin@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Thanks a lot.

I am afraid it is a coded prayer. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;It contains hints in =\r\ncoded form for several specific sadhanas to get specific \n&gt;&gt;&gt;results using =\r\nDevi Saptashati.\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; From that point of view, one can understand w=\r\nhy it says there is no siddhi \n&gt;&gt;&gt;without Kunjika stotra. However, one will=\r\n almost certainly not get siddhi by \n&gt;&gt;&gt;merely chanting Kunjika stotra or a=\r\ndding it to one&#39;s Saptashati chanting.

Just by \n&gt;&gt;&gt;having the checkbook of one&#39;s mother, one may not be ab=\r\nle to get her wealth. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Check needs her signature.
