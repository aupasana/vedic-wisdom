Maybe its time for you go back to some more genu=\r\nine reading with a open mind. It will do you a world of good.&gt;&gt;&gt;\n \n*       =\r\n *        *\n \nWe need to be respectful to rishis, yogis and other seers who=\r\n passed down genuine knowledge. Paramahamsa Yogananda is a great yogi and a=\r\n person with a high level of realization, who came to earth for a specific =\r\nmission and executed it so well.\n \nIf somebody quoting him is saying &quot;fancy=\r\n&quot; things, please realize that it may be due to misunderstanding by that per=\r\nson. For example, even Patanjali was being quoted and misused earlier, base=\r\nd on a misunderstanding.\n \nIf one is pure and ready, just a single book by =\r\na good author may be sufficient to give perfect knowledge. But, otherwise, =\r\neven a really good book may not stop one from forming some wrong notions. O=\r\nf course, reading multiple good books may give a better perspective. Howeve=\r\nr, let us not explicitly or implicitly put down any good book or author her=\r\ne.\n \n*        *        *\n \nI want to make a philosophical comment.\n \nTake a=\r\n simple question: What is the purpose of debate in a matter relating to kno=\r\nwledge and when is a debate over?\n \nOne with kshatriya temperament may want=\r\n to assert one&#39;s supremacy and correctness and may want to see the opponent=\r\n kneel down and accept defeat. Such a debater may sometimes get personal an=\r\nd pass personal remarks that are dismissive or condescending or disparaging=\r\n in nature/tone.\n \nBut, one with braahmana temperament does not care about =\r\nassertions of supremacy, victory, defeat etc. Such a debater only wants cor=\r\nrect knowledge to be spread and wrong knowledge to be contained, to the bes=\r\nt of one&#39;s limited ability. Such a debater will stay away from personal com=\r\nments, focus on the subject matter and make only those comments that promot=\r\ne further understanding and clarification of knowledge. If, for example, th=\r\ne opponent changes his/her stand in the middle of the debate without acknow=\r\nledging his/her mistake and accepting defeat, it will not be a big deal for=\r\n a braahmana debater. As long as wrong knowledge is contained, the purpose =\r\nof the debate is served! There is no need to put down the person. Moreover,=\r\n a true braahmana debater will display the same braahmana qualities *even w=\r\nhen* he/she is confronted by a kshatriya debater.\n \nI&#39;d love to see some le=\r\narned members develop a braahmana attitude to debating here. Spiritual know=\r\nledge is essentially a braahminical pursuit and let us maintain a braahmini=\r\ncal attitude in it.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotis=\r\nh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websit=\r\ne: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n--------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nand=\r\ny &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste Nitish\n&gt;  \n&gt; Check below.\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Regard=\r\ns\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sun, 4/10/09, yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: y=\r\neeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Gyan Marga\n&gt; To: =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Sunday, 4 October, 2009, 4:45 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n|| OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; Namaskar Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your contribution - a=\r\nll you have done is to prove what is already known.\n&gt; \n&gt; You had already, d=\r\nuring you very first mail stated that everything is already known.  So then=\r\n why are you wastingme here? -:)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Therefore, Ahamkara exists even in =\r\nbeyond the death for a normal \n&gt; &gt; human being. Therewfore, Ahamkara is pre=\r\nsent in the astral/casual \n&gt; &gt; plane as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Do you realize what i=\r\ns being talked about and what you have ended up proving ? \n&gt;  \n&gt; Maybe, mos=\r\nt people here realize it better than you do! Thats what makes your statemen=\r\nts sound so incorrigible funny to say the least.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Wherein did I deny t=\r\nhat Ahamkara is not present in Astral/Causal bodies ?\n&gt; \n&gt; You did deny it =\r\nquite vehemently. Kindly check yourolder mails. You make a statement A then=\r\n in the course of discussion you conveniently change it to B and then jump =\r\naround assuming ridiculous airs. At least, try and remember what you yourse=\r\nlf speak. Go back and re check you own mails here.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why is Ahamkara not=\r\n dominant in Astral/Causal bodies ?\n&gt; The reason I have already given in th=\r\ne first mail in sufficient detail.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thats again your assumption. Ahamk=\r\nara is indeed a dominant force in all planes untill one reaches a state bey=\r\nond ego.\n&gt; \n&gt;  BRING IT BACK AT REBIRTH TO THE EARTH. AND THEN, HE WILL REC=\r\nLAIM HIS LOST TERRITORY AND WEALTH - THE CONFLICTS THAT WILL ARISE WILL BE =\r\nBEYOND ANYBODY&#39;S CONTROL. \n&gt;  \n&gt; This shows that you have not understood ev=\r\nen 1 percent of what has been told to you till now by other in this forum, =\r\nmaybe because you have already decided to close your mind.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ahamkara i=\r\ns NOT confied to acquiring or not acquiring of weath. THE specifics will de=\r\npend on the law of karma. The essential sense of I-ness will very much rema=\r\nin in ALL planes, the speciifcs gets filled in by karmic repurcussions and =\r\ndesires.\n&gt;  \n&gt; THUS, THE BEAUTIFUL ASTRAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS O=\r\nF MANAS, while CAUSAL SPHERE ARE SENSED BY THE I-NESS OF CHITTA.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Any =\r\nI-ness is Ahamkara. Period.\n&gt; \n&gt; i Sri Paramahansa Yogananda&quot;, he has menti=\r\noned about all these things (what happens to a soul at death and so on) in =\r\nsuch a simplistic manner in his Gita commentaries, that even a layman can u=\r\nnderstand it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Is that the only book you have based all your fancy ide=\r\nas on? Maybe its time for you go back to some more genuine reading with a o=\r\npen mind. It will do you a world of good.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Nitish\n\n\n\n"}}
