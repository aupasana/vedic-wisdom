Your tone se=\r\nems to imply that I somehow put down Eastern philosophy? I simply made a po=\r\nint about which path of inquiry to *start* from. Please read my inlined rep=\r\nlies.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sundeep,\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Western philosophers are good and =\r\nsmart people, but their understanding of the Absolute (Brahman) and its Man=\r\nifestation (Duality) is nowhere near that of Rishis in my view. I do not se=\r\ne a need to reconcile things. If you are interested in the findings of rish=\r\nis, study eastern philosophy without carrying the *baggage* of western phil=\r\nosophy.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n\nVery loose=\r\nly speaking - just in order to convey my point - Western philosophy is bett=\r\ner at painstakingly enumerating and explaining things in the sensory domain=\r\n, Eastern is better in the non-sensory domain. The &quot;reconcile&quot; I am talking=\r\n about is a wrong choice of word, I apologize. It seems to imply that they =\r\nboth have explanations for the same thing and that they need to be reconcil=\r\ned. What I really meant is more like unify and bridge in order to build a c=\r\nomplete and unambiguous view, that smoothly takes one from the sensory to t=\r\nhe non-sensory. The reason to &quot;unify and bridge&quot; is to clear misunderstandi=\r\nngs. Jumping straight to the non-sensory creates a lot of misconceptions du=\r\ne to subjectivity. Doesnt mean that Eastern non-sensory observations are wr=\r\nong, simply that they are easily misinterpreted.\n\nThe only baggage that com=\r\nes with Western philosophy, in my humble experience, is a tendency to dismi=\r\nss the non-sensory. Not all Western philosophers do that - although the ove=\r\nrall trend in modern times (e.g. existentialism) is to do so. I let go of t=\r\nhat baggage in 2002, personally speaking. So I do not have that specific bi=\r\nas anymore. Is there anything else that you have in mind?\n\n\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Before =\r\ntaking an issue with this approach, let me answer your specific question.\n&gt;=\r\n =A0\n&gt; Ahamkara is not the hole in the doughnut. Ahamkara is the &quot;space&quot; th=\r\nat fills the entire doughnut, including the hole in the center and the outs=\r\nide. Manas (sensory mind), its organs of perception and organs of action, b=\r\nuddhi (logical mind) and part of chitta (memory) that is akin to a cache in=\r\n computer memory is part of the outside of doughnut. Part of chitta (memory=\r\n) that is uncached (stored from *forgotten* existences) is in the hole in t=\r\nhe middle.\n\nThank you for the specific answer. Now I have 2 specific questi=\r\nons, and these are really the questions for which I did all the context bui=\r\nldup, and are as yet unanswered:\n1) If you say that Ahamkara pervades the e=\r\nntire edible part of the doughnut, then, since the edible part of the dough=\r\nnut represents *what one is conscious of*, then you are saying that one is =\r\nfully conscious of Ahamkara, right? This to me is not accurate. Let&#39;s not t=\r\nalk theoretical concepts and terms here, but experience, and then try to co=\r\nrrelate it to known concepts. Please specifically correct me where you thin=\r\nk I&#39;m wrong. When I close my eyes in a peaceful undisturbed environment, an=\r\nd the thought of any object comes up, then in my mind there is the object a=\r\nnd there is me observing it. The object is clearly in the edible part of th=\r\ne doughnut, but the &quot;me&quot; isnt. It is the subject, the observer, and is unob=\r\nservable by itself - although it is always present as the observer. Since i=\r\nt is not observable, it is not in the edible part of the doughnut. I say th=\r\nis for the average everyday human being like myself. It seems to me that th=\r\ne term Ahamkara refers to something in this unobservable observer. The obse=\r\nrver is conscious of its own existence, but cant actually turn it&#39;s attenti=\r\non to itself. Simply because everything in the edible part of the doughnut =\r\nis observed by this observer (which is the fact you use to conclude that th=\r\nat Ahamkara pervades the entire doughnut), doesnt mean the observer can be =\r\nthe object of it&#39;s own attention. For this reason, I take the Ahamkara to b=\r\ne in center of the doughnut, along with what you have said are the forgotte=\r\nn memories of past lives. Is that entire unobservable thing the Ahamkara, o=\r\nr is only the centering &quot;force&quot; in that the Ahamkara? Clearly Ahamkara and =\r\nego are two different things - Ahamkara is that unobservable quantity that =\r\ngives this indivisible feeling of I. Ego is the field of consciousness of t=\r\nhe average human being (the doughnut as described earlier).\n\nb) Now, and th=\r\nis is the main East vs West thing I would like to highlight, I find no term=\r\n in Eastern thinking that is the equivalent of the ego as defined above (fi=\r\neld of consciousness of the average human being - current sense experience =\r\n+ current &quot;cache&quot; if you will). Manas, sensory organs are simply the instru=\r\nments that construct this field of consciousness, they are not the contents=\r\n of the field of consciousness. You will say - why define this unimportant =\r\nterm, how is it important? It is important because this is the only thing (=\r\ni.e. the ego doughnut is the only thing) an average person knows and experi=\r\nences their entire life. When you are asking them to be spiritual by, for e=\r\nxample, meditating on the sense of I, what exactly are you saying? You are =\r\nasking that Ahamkara-containing unobservable observer to ditch the ego (i.e=\r\n. not focus on the senses + current cache) and turn it&#39;s attention (what ex=\r\nactly is the term for &quot;attention of the Ahamkara-containing unobservable ob=\r\nserver&quot;) onto itself. See how I&#39;m stumbling around creating terms and names=\r\n as I go? This is because I dont find exact descriptions of an approach sta=\r\nrting from the ego-doughnut, which is the only thing that I, an average hum=\r\nan being, knows.  I could go on - going further - the chitta - memory-store=\r\n - is clearly compartmentalized, right? Since the sookshma sarira is eterna=\r\nl, how come people dont have continuous memory? What happens to the ego dou=\r\nghnut upon death - bewilderment of the unobservable observer? But the memor=\r\ny must be getting compartmentalized at this point because on rebirth, those=\r\n sections of memory clearly have a barrier put up in front of them (since n=\r\no average person has any pre-birth memories). Also, what is Kundalini awake=\r\nning in this terminology - the doughnut suddenly expanding inward? \n\nIt is =\r\nthese things that I seek to understand starting from the consistent common =\r\nplace that I, as an average human being, knows. That consistent common plac=\r\ne is the ego doughnut.\n\nI will stop here, awaiting your reply..\n\nRegards,\n\n=\r\nSundeep\n\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThe reason is that western-style inquiry/explanations always\n&gt; &gt; originate =\r\nfrom sensory observables - which are of *common\n&gt; &gt; experience to all*, whe=\r\nreas eastern-style inquiry/explanations\n&gt; &gt; may originate from sometimes no=\r\nn-sensory observables, which\n&gt; &gt; lead to many misconceptions/subjective int=\r\nerpretations.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; There are a lot of blind people in the world. Sensory=\r\n experiences related to vision are unknown to them. Can they dismiss explan=\r\nations originating from vision as &quot;misconceptions/subjective interpretation=\r\ns&quot;?\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Why should it be common experience to &quot;all&quot;? If some virus inva=\r\ndes the world and takes away vision from 99.9999% population of the world, =\r\nwill observations made based on vision by the 0.0001% people still having v=\r\nision be a valid basis for objective inquiry/explanations?\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Not all non-sensory observ=\r\nations are subjective. There is some uniformity in non-sensory observations=\r\n too. Just as two people watching a cloth with their eyes may independently=\r\n say it is &quot;red&quot; in color, similarly two people observing something using n=\r\non-sensory observation may say the same thing about it.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; As a simple=\r\n example, I know someone who internally &quot;heard&quot; a specific beejaakshara whe=\r\nn his Kundalini rose to a specific chakra for the first time. At that time,=\r\n he did not know much about Kundalini and chakras. Some months later, he bo=\r\nught some books and read them. He was surprised to learn that that beejaaks=\r\nhara was indeed associated with that chakra in tantra literature. As he did=\r\n not know all this before the internal experience, it was not a case of pre=\r\n-conditioned imagination causing an experience/hallucination. Without being=\r\n influenced by any tantra texts, he experienced something specific that was=\r\n well-captured by pre-existing tantra texts. I know several such cases.\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; From my own experience and experience of people I trust, I know for s=\r\nure that truths captured by sUpanishads and tantra texts were *independentl=\r\ny* experienced by several people. I also know that people can experience an=\r\nd realize those truths even now, even without reading the books and being c=\r\nonditioned by them.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; From my point of view, there is nothing pristine about observation=\r\ns made with sensory perception. Just as some non-sensory perception can be =\r\nhallucination, similarly some *sensory* perception can also be hallucinatio=\r\nn!\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; More importantly, the truth that can be captured by sensory perc=\r\neption is quite limited. From my experience, I am convinced that the Absolu=\r\nte, a glimpse of which can liberate one from the cycle of happiness and sad=\r\nness, is beyond sensory perception, as declared by rishis in the past.\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; I humbly, and yet firmly, suggest to seekers that a fresh study of ea=\r\nstern philosophy without carrying the *baggage* of western philosophy will =\r\nbe more productive. More importantly, a direct individual experience is the=\r\n only way to understand things correctly and theoretical studies can only g=\r\no so far. Study if you must, but do some sadhana and try to overcome the sh=\r\nadripus. That will help far more than studying volumes.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Best regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------\n&gt; =A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writin=\r\ngs,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org\n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.=\r\norg \n&gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm\n&gt; =A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =\r\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;vedicastrostudent=\r\n@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A while ago, there was a discussio=\r\nn on koshas, chakras and sariras. Although it was useful, I feel it didnt r=\r\neally get to the crux of the matter. I have for a while been pondering how =\r\nto pose the question in the correct way in order to elicit, from you or any=\r\none else, the level of answers that I would like to see. I&#39;ll make an attem=\r\npt now, I would ask only that you read the whole post..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; First, con=\r\ntrary to what most people on this group probably believe, I feel it is best=\r\n to start, in intellectual discussion at least, with the western concept of=\r\n consciousness. The reason is that western-style inquiry/explanations alway=\r\ns originate from sensory observables - which are of *common experience to a=\r\nll*, whereas eastern-style inquiry/explanations may originate from sometime=\r\ns non-sensory observables, which lead to many misconceptions/subjective int=\r\nerpretations. So if we are to reach an understanding that is to some degree=\r\n objective, it is best to start from some common ground.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For this =\r\npurpose, I&#39;ll take Carl Jung&#39;s definitions as a starting point. What is ego=\r\n? From his point of view, ego is one&#39;s everyday field of consciousness. Wha=\r\nt is one conscious of? Things reported by the senses - the material univers=\r\ne. But also feelings and memories, which have no material representation - =\r\nthey are not &quot;gathered&quot; by the senses as the material world is. What is the=\r\n feeling of &quot;I&quot;? It is the center of the ego, that gives the ego a feeling =\r\nof oneness. However, this ego is not a solid circle i.e if the inside of th=\r\ne circle is the contents of the consciousness, it is not as if the center i=\r\ns a content of consciousness too! The ego is more like a doughnut, with the=\r\n empty central part being what Jung calls, naturally, the unconscious. We a=\r\nll feel whole i.e. my hand is mine, my leg is mine, the memory of savoring =\r\na mango last night is also mine, but am I the hand - no; am I the leg - no;=\r\n am I the memory - no; I&#39;ll still be I without them,\n&gt;  though maybe not a =\r\nhappy I. So all this is consistent with the doughnut model - an invisible I=\r\n in the center, conscious of the edible part of the doughnut.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At t=\r\nhis point, even the least spiritual of people would be hard pressed to disa=\r\ngree with me. So from my point of view, this is good and common ground i.e.=\r\n a good point from where to start investigating vedic definitions. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; So at this point, I&#39;ll pose my first set of questions - Where does this d=\r\noughnut fit vis-a-vis the antahakarana? Is the doughnut inside the manas wi=\r\nth the ahamkara at the invisible center? Or is the doughnut in the physical=\r\n body with the entire antahakarana at the invisible center? Either way, whe=\r\nn you raise kundalini/attempt spiritual awakening, you are pushing the insi=\r\nde of the doughnut toward the center, right? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I can get to more qu=\r\nestions as and when you reply..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sundeep\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
