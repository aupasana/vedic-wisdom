A millionaire may open a bank account in=\r\n his son&#39;s name with a starting balance of a million dollars. This is akin =\r\nto a good guru initiating a sishya in a mantra. Sishya starts off by gettin=\r\ng some of guru&#39;s attainment. But the son may waste those million dollars an=\r\nd end up with nothing. Similarly the sishya may fall and not achieve anythi=\r\nng.

Th=\r\nis is akin to=C2=A0a person doing sadhana with a mantra without guru and at=\r\ntaining some level in the mantra.\n=C2=A0\nSome people hold the view that man=\r\ntras cannot be chanted without a proper &quot;initiation&quot; . This view is especia=\r\nlly prevalent in some sections of society w.r.t. navarna mantra. However, I=\r\n disagree with that view.\n=C2=A0\nIf you know the mantra (!), just chant it.=\r\n What would an initiating guru have done for you? Perhaps he would&#39;ve given=\r\n some of his attainment in the mantra to you. Well, you can do it yourself =\r\nif you work hard. Or a guru would&#39;ve taught you the right nyasas to be done=\r\n before the mantra. Well, you can get the nyasas from books too. Moreover, =\r\nwhat most people do today for nyasas is anyway just a ritual with no meanin=\r\ng. Nyasa literally means placement. You place various sounds in various bod=\r\ny parts (like the tips of various fingers, heart, top of head, eyes etc). P=\r\neople merely act out some signals while saying the sounds. This &quot;placement&quot;=\r\n is actually supposed to be an internal act and it creates an ideal environ=\r\nment for the repetition of mantra. Due to the external actions, what is sup=\r\nposed to occur internally does not occur in most. So the sounds end up not =\r\ngetting properly placed in the body. In other words, what I am trying to sa=\r\ny is that most people do\n not know how to &quot;place&quot; various &quot;sounds&quot; in vario=\r\nus body parts.
