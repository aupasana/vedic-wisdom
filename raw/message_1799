You can add ghee/coconut pieces any ti=\r\nme, even if you are not saying Swaha.\n&gt; 2) Can i add ghee after i do purnah=\r\nuti because then i will be sure that it will get burned , otherwise some pi=\r\neces remain.\nVijay: Yes. No problem. BTW, if any pieces are not burnt fully=\r\n, do not bother about them. It is alright. Imagine as if you were serving t=\r\nhe guess with some sweets. You will like if they eat them fully but, if the=\r\ny leave some amount you wouldn&#39;t mind right? Leaving some does not mean you=\r\nr guess did not appreciate your gesture.\n\n&gt; 3) Does it matter how i keep th=\r\nat piece of coconut , which i kept in the kund for PURNAHUTI, i mean ,the p=\r\nart6 thats cut upside or towards down. Hope this question is clear.\nVijay: =\r\nNo, it does not matter. If you keep the dark color up, it burns longer easi=\r\nly. Other than convenience how you keep does not really matter much. How ev=\r\ner, try to imagine the purnahuti is your own igo/identification. I say &quot;Lor=\r\nd kill my ignorance and false identity&quot; while placing purnahuti.\n\n&gt; Regards=\r\n\n&gt; Jitender\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Vijaya Kumara Lak=\r\nshmi Narayana Rao Pingali&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jitender,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nAfter long delay, finally by hte grace of god i did today mahaganpati homam=\r\n,but i hv few queries\n&gt; &gt; Vijay: I am gad for you.
