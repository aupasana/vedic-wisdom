Vijay gave this details as an answer to clarify some query but se=\r\ne it has created a kind of motives other than spiritual progress, in many o=\r\nf us. now this thing will keep on lingering in our mind for long unless we =\r\nmercilessly remove it. even Narasimha mentioned few days back that Mamara i=\r\ns for Money, White til for Spiritual progress etc.. and that was also suffi=\r\ncient for creating ripples.\n\nNarsimha, in his mnual, has categorically ment=\r\nioned this (I don&#39;t know if he wish to revisit and change that)-\n\n[\nSimilar=\r\nly, you have to be careful if you perform a homam for certain material goal=\r\ns (such as\ngetting money, attracting someone, destroying someone etc). If y=\r\nou perform a homam just to\nshow your love to god, cleanse yourself spiritua=\r\nlly and make yourself worthy of divine\ncommunion, then there are no risks. =\r\nThe procedure taught in this document is based on the\nteachings of rishis a=\r\nnd it is safe for anybody to use. Small mistakes will not result in any\npun=\r\nishment.\nIn fact, it is expected that everybody who uses this document is i=\r\nnterested in only the second\nkind of goal, i.e. spiritual cleansing and upl=\r\niftment\n]\n\nBUT important thing is that, the knowledge provided by Narasimha=\r\n and vijay about Different materials for Aahuti and Direction respectively,=\r\n can be used for *other Jan Hitaay*. i mean don&#39;t use it for ourself but ca=\r\nn be used for a person who is dire difficulty of Finance/Health etc... for =\r\nexample, if you know somebody who is in a trouble due to financial crisis, =\r\nyou can suggest him to do some japa facing North Direction. for health matt=\r\ners, south direction can be suggested and finally thinking &#39;Neki kar aur da=\r\nriya me dal&#39; or &#39;Krishnarpana&#39; or &#39;Shivarpana&#39;:)\n\nI asked the same question=\r\n to my guru initially. he told me that when i perform atleast 10 homa mysel=\r\nf and become proficient in the ritual then i may think of performing it at =\r\nother&#39;s home. You can ask your friends to join you and sit while you are pe=\r\nrforming the homam at you house. if they are really intrested they will com=\r\ne and then leave it to Mahaganapati. if he wishes, they will also start tak=\r\ning serious intrest.\n\nlastly, Narasimha can answer you better for all the q=\r\nuestions.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajes=\r\nh rajgor &lt;rajesh_rajgor2003@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narsimhaji / Utpal,\n&gt; \n&gt; C=\r\nan we do mahaganapathi homam by sitting in different directions?..
