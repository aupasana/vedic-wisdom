This particular goddess, according to my guru, attracts others\n&gt; to a s=\r\nadhaka and gives &quot;control and mastery&quot; over others.\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to share wha=\r\nt I realized towards the end of sadhana, because that\n&gt; realization MAY be =\r\nhelpful to some others.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; DIFEERENT TRAJECTORIES\n&gt;\n&gt; There are =\r\nbeings that can give specific limited things, but the ultimate\n&gt; goal of sa=\r\ndhana is liberation and sadhana of higher beings eventually\n&gt; transforms on=\r\ne and takes one closer to liberation. What these higher\n&gt; beings are suppos=\r\ned to give in tradition is a simplificaation or\n&gt; symbolism of something su=\r\nblime that takes towards liberation, from\n&gt; *different angles*.\n&gt;\n&gt; For exa=\r\nmple, ability to work very hard (with no expectations of anything\n&gt; selfish=\r\n in return), fine judgment and discrimination (that increases\n&gt; detachment =\r\nin one&#39;s actions), complete surrender to god (and\n&gt; whole-hearted acceptanc=\r\ne of every life situation one finds oneself in),\n&gt; ability to focus mind (o=\r\nn a mantra or a deity and not let various\n&gt; thoughts distract it), are all =\r\nuseful to a sadhaka. If one develops one\n&gt; of these 4 basic qualities, othe=\r\nr qualities will eventually develop.\n&gt; They all lead to the same thing - li=\r\nberation - in the end, but the\n&gt; trajectory is different.\n&gt;\n&gt; These four ba=\r\nsic paths constitute what are known as karma yoga\n&gt; (communion through acti=\r\non), jnana yoga (communion through wisdom),\n&gt; bhakti yoga (communion throug=\r\nh devotion) and raja yoga (communion\n&gt; through [self-]control). However, th=\r\nere are many sub-paths.\n&gt;\n&gt; Basically, different higher beings can increase=\r\n a different fine quality\n&gt; inside one, which is conducive to liberation. T=\r\nhe trajectory is\n&gt; different with each deity.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; TOO MUNDANE?\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; The higher being I worshipped is supposed to increase control and\n&gt; maste=\r\nry over others. While I did the sadhana in the last few months, I\n&gt; wondere=\r\nd how *that* can lead to liberation. After all, control and\n&gt; mastery over =\r\nothers sounded too *mundane* to me to have anything to do\n&gt; with liberation=\r\n. But a simple realization came towards the end of the\n&gt; sadhana.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; CONTROL & FRICTION\n&gt;\n&gt; Whether A is attracted to B or B is attracted t=\r\no A, the bottomline is\n&gt; that objects A and B come together. The ability to=\r\n attract others also\n&gt; means to come together with them.\n&gt;\n&gt; One is unhappy=\r\n with others and thinks of controlling them, when one&#39;s\n&gt; own agenda is mis=\r\n-aligned with their agenda. The friction between the\n&gt; agendas is the basis=\r\n for the entire dynamics of likes, dislikes,\n&gt; frustrations etc. Control of=\r\n that friction comes when the agendas are\n&gt; nicely aligned!\n&gt;\n&gt; Ability to =\r\ncontrol the agenda pursued by someone else has limited use,\n&gt; scope and lif=\r\netime. Such an ability can work only with a limited set of\n&gt; people or a li=\r\nmited amount of time. This is like pumping rainwater from\n&gt; the fields surr=\r\nounding a hill to the top of the hill. It requires a lot\n&gt; of energy that i=\r\ns proportional to the area of the field and the amount\n&gt; of rainwater.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nThe best way to avoid the friction, with ALL beings of the cosmos, is to\n&gt; =\r\neliminate one&#39;s own agenda! This is like removing the hill from the\n&gt; middl=\r\ne of the field, in the above analogy.\n&gt;\n&gt; If one has no agenda whatsoever, =\r\nthen there is no friction with anyone&#39;s\n&gt; agenda. There is no reason to lik=\r\ne or dislike anyone or find fault with\n&gt; or admire anyone. One can just obs=\r\nerve others. Because one has no\n&gt; agenda, one can identify with the agendas=\r\n of others and relate to them\n&gt; completely. One can then put oneself comple=\r\ntely in the shoes of others\n&gt; and feel their pleasures, pains etc.\n&gt;\n&gt; When=\r\n one has an agenda and another has another agenda, then there is\n&gt; friction=\r\n and one feels a need to &quot;control&quot; and remove friction. But,\n&gt; when one has=\r\n no agenda and another has an agenda, then there is no\n&gt; friction. One can =\r\nthen completely &quot;understand&quot; the perspective of the\n&gt; other (because there =\r\nis no friction from one&#39;s own agenda stopping one\n&gt; from doing so!). What b=\r\netter mastery and control can one have on someone\n&gt; else than be able to un=\r\nderstand that person completely?!\n&gt;\n&gt; Though what I described above is the =\r\nend, one path to that end is to\n&gt; identify one&#39;s own agenda/conditioning th=\r\nat is resulting in friction,\n&gt; whenever one is not happy with someone, and =\r\ntry to remove/suppress that\n&gt; conditioning. One can first try this with a f=\r\new people (e.g. spouse).\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; LOVE & COMPASSION FOR ALL\n&gt;\n&gt; Bottom=\r\nline is this: Control and mastery over others does not mean making\n&gt; them t=\r\nhink and behave in tune with the agenda of one&#39;s own limited\n&gt; conditioning=\r\n. Instead, it means overcoming&#39;s one&#39;s own agendas and being\n&gt; able to put =\r\noneself in the shoes of anybody and understand and feel each\n&gt; of their fee=\r\nlings and emotions. It means unconditional love and\n&gt; compassion for all.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; LOOKING DOWN ON OTHERS\n&gt;\n&gt; When one is doing some sadhana, one=\r\n of the stages one goes through may\n&gt; be to feel proud of one&#39;s sadhana, lo=\r\nok at some others doing such a\n&gt; sadhana favorably or with admiration and l=\r\nook down on others who are not\n&gt; doing much sadhana (or doing a different s=\r\nadhana!) and pursuing mundane\n&gt; things. This may be a natural tendency, but=\r\n realize that this is a work\n&gt; of the limited personality or ego.\n&gt;\n&gt; One h=\r\nas to overcome that tendency, for looking down on others will\n&gt; eventually =\r\nblock one.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; LOVING THE DIVINE MOTHER\n&gt;\n&gt; People talk of loving=\r\n the Divine Mother. The personality of Divine\n&gt; Mother is beyond one&#39;s perc=\r\neption. How can one really love Her then?\n&gt;\n&gt; One may do tremendous sadhana=\r\n and get tremendous visions and think that\n&gt; one has grasped the personalit=\r\ny of Divine Mother, but what one perceives\n&gt; is merely what one&#39;s condition=\r\ning fancies and is capable of grasping!\n&gt; The complete personality of Divin=\r\ne Mother is beyond anybody&#39;s\n&gt; perception.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, Divine Mother does =\r\nmanifest in a perceptible way as the cosmos.\n&gt; Every being in the cosmos is=\r\n a limited manifestation of Her. Being able\n&gt; to love every being is the FI=\r\nRST step in truly loving the Divine Mother.\n&gt;\n&gt; Loving someone because they=\r\n are doing some good work (as we see it!) or\n&gt; because they have something =\r\nwe need (as we see it!) etc, is *egoistic*\n&gt; loving. Such love is *conditio=\r\nned* by the agendas of a limited ego. Such\n&gt; love cannot extend to entire c=\r\nosmos and permanently. The only love that\n&gt; can extend to entire cosmos and=\r\n be permanent is unconditional love of\n&gt; all beings.\n&gt;\n&gt; That comes only wh=\r\nen one has no agenda and no expectations from anyone.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; N=\r\narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourse=\r\nlf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spi=\r\nrituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; ----=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   \n&gt;\n\r\n--e89a8ff25008b2858504bad1b012\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;verdana,sans-serif&quot;&gt;Hare Ramakr=\r\nishna!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; color=3D&quot;#=\r\n000099&quot; face=3D&quot;verdana, sans-serif&quot;&gt;Let us imagine, how Shri Ramana-Mahars=\r\nhi or Ramakrishna-Pramahamsa or Swami Sivananda would have responded if the=\r\ny have been put up with the hypothetical friends described by Aswin Kumar. =\r\nWouldn&#39;t it give us a clue?&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000099&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;font&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;verdana,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/f=\r\nont&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;&#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, sans-serif&quot; color=3D&quot;#009900&quot;&gt;=\r\nAum Tat Sat!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;font class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; color=3D=\r\n&quot;#009900&quot; face=3D&quot;&#39;trebuchet ms&#39;, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;i&gt;Hari&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Fri, Mar 9, 2012 at 3:45 PM, aswin kum=\r\nar &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:aswinefy2003@...&quot;&gt;aswine=\r\nfy2003@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quot=\r\ne&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;border-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex&quot;&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n  =\r\n  &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-size:12pt;font-family=\r\n:times new roman,new york,times,serif&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;What is wrong in having g=\r\nood agenda like doing havan regualrily &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;though f=\r\nriends in=C2=A0 our=C2=A0 room may not like that=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan&gt;In this case can I drop the idea of doing havan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;font-=\r\nsize:12pt&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman,new york,times,serif;=\r\nfont-size:12pt&quot;&gt;\n\n &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt; =\r\n &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha PVR Rao &lt=\r\n;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;pvr@...&lt;/a&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto=\r\n:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n\n &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Friday, =\r\n9 March 2012 5:51 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom]\n Liberation, Control &amp; Love&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;h5&quot;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n =\r\n     \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nI recently finished a spe=\r\ncific sadhana of a specific form of Divine &lt;br&gt;\nMother.

One can then put oneself completely in the shoes of others &lt;br&gt;\nand fee=\r\nl their pleasures, pains etc.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen one has an agenda and another h=\r\nas another agenda, then there is &lt;br&gt;\nfriction and one feels a need to &quo=\r\nt;control&quot; and remove friction. But, &lt;br&gt;\nwhen one has no agenda and a=\r\nnother has an agenda, then there is no &lt;br&gt;\nfriction. One can then complete=\r\nly &quot;understand&quot; the perspective of the &lt;br&gt;\nother (because there =\r\nis no friction from one&#39;s own agenda stopping one &lt;br&gt;\nfrom doing so!).=\r\n What better mastery and control can one have on someone &lt;br&gt;\nelse than be =\r\nable to understand that person completely?!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nThough what I describe=\r\nd above is the end, one path to that end is to &lt;br&gt;\nidentify one&#39;s own =\r\nagenda/conditioning that is resulting in friction, &lt;br&gt;\nwhenever one is not=\r\n happy with someone, and try to remove/suppress that &lt;br&gt;\nconditioning. One=\r\n can first try this with a few people (e.g. spouse).&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *   =\r\n     *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLOVE &amp; COMPASSION FOR ALL&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBottomline is this: =\r\nControl and mastery over others does not mean making &lt;br&gt;\nthem think and be=\r\nhave in tune with the agenda of one&#39;s own limited &lt;br&gt;\nconditioning. In=\r\nstead, it means overcoming&#39;s one&#39;s own agendas and being &lt;br&gt;\nable =\r\nto put oneself in the shoes of anybody and understand and feel each &lt;br&gt;\nof=\r\n their feelings and emotions. It means unconditional love and &lt;br&gt;\ncompassi=\r\non for all.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLOOKING DOWN ON OTHERS&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nWhen one is doing some sadhana, one of the stages one goes through m=\r\nay &lt;br&gt;\nbe to feel proud of one&#39;s sadhana, look at some others doing su=\r\nch a &lt;br&gt;\nsadhana favorably or with admiration and look down on others who =\r\nare not &lt;br&gt;\ndoing much sadhana (or doing a different sadhana!) and pursuin=\r\ng mundane &lt;br&gt;\nthings. This may be a natural tendency, but realize that thi=\r\ns is a work &lt;br&gt;\nof the limited personality or ego.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOne has to ove=\r\nrcome that tendency, for looking down on others will &lt;br&gt;\neventually block =\r\none.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLOVING THE DIVINE MOTHER&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nPeople talk of loving the Divine Mother. The personality of Divine &lt;br&gt;\nM=\r\nother is beyond one&#39;s perception. How can one really love Her then?&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nOne may do tremendous sadhana and get tremendous visions and think th=\r\nat &lt;br&gt;\none has grasped the personality of Divine Mother, but what one perc=\r\neives &lt;br&gt;\nis merely what one&#39;s conditioning fancies and is capable of =\r\ngrasping! &lt;br&gt;\nThe complete personality of Divine Mother is beyond anybody&=\r\n#39;s &lt;br&gt;\nperception.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nHowever, Divine Mother does manifest in a p=\r\nerceptible way as the cosmos. &lt;br&gt;\nEvery being in the cosmos is a limited m=\r\nanifestation of Her. Being able &lt;br&gt;\nto love every being is the FIRST step =\r\nin truly loving the Divine Mother.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLoving someone because they are=\r\n doing some good work (as we see it!) or &lt;br&gt;\nbecause they have something w=\r\ne need (as we see it!) etc, is *egoistic* &lt;br&gt;\nloving. Such love is *condit=\r\nioned* by the agendas of a limited ego. Such &lt;br&gt;\nlove cannot extend to ent=\r\nire cosmos and permanently. The only love that &lt;br&gt;\ncan extend to entire co=\r\nsmos and be permanent is unconditional love of &lt;br&gt;\nall beings.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nTh=\r\nat comes only when one has no agenda and no expectations from anyone.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nBest regards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n---------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------&lt;br&gt;\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyo=\r\ntish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homa=\r\nm and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n                   &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n      Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n   Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; href=3D&quot;http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n                      Twitter ID: @homam10=\r\n8&lt;br&gt;\n----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height=\r\n:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--e89a8ff25008b2858504bad1b012--\r\n\n"}}
