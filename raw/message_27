It all depends o=\r\nn\nyou look at it. I have received it from a different source and\nsharing it=\r\n with you all. Kindly read and re-read and remember.\n\n\nTHE PERSPECTIVE\n\nOne=\r\n sees the top of a coin and says it is Heads, the other sees it\nfrom the ot=\r\nher side and says it is Tails - who is correct?\n\nBoth are. It is the same c=\r\noin being seen from two different sides.\nYou have the power to see from bot=\r\nh sides - so it is your decision\nwhich side you want to be in - the top or =\r\nthe bottom, the left or\nright.\n\nOn one side is God and on the other is the =\r\nworld (a reflection of\nGod).\n\nThe coin is like a one sided mirror - in the =\r\ncentre. God sees you\nbut till you are seeing from the other side - you only=\r\n see the &#39;I&#39;\nand not God. The diagram below somewhat captures what is tryin=\r\ng to\nbe expressed.\n\nHeads COIN Tails\n\n[[GOD]] [Faith Belief || Knowledge We=\r\nalth] [WORLD] - I\n\nIt is just our own created perspective. I came across th=\r\nis message\nand felt that it enhances the above topic of discussion. For you=\r\nr\nreading and comments.\n\nWhat makes a person rich?\n\nOne day a father of a v=\r\nery wealthy family took his son on a trip to\nthe country with the firm purp=\r\nose of showing his son how poor people\nlive. They spent a couple of days an=\r\nd nights on the farm of what\nwould be considered a very poor family.\n\nOn th=\r\neir return from their trip, the father asked his son, &quot;How was\nthe trip?&quot;\n\n=\r\n&quot;It was great, Dad.&quot;\n\n&quot;Did you see how poor people live?&quot; the father asked.=\r\n\n\n&quot;Oh yeah,&quot; said the son.\n\n&quot;So, tell me, what did you learn from the trip?=\r\n&quot; asked the father.\n\nThe son answered: &quot;I saw that we have one dog and they=\r\n had four. We\nhave a pool that reaches to the middle of our garden and they=\r\n have a\ncreek that has no end. We have imported lanterns in our garden and\n=\r\nthey have the stars at night. Our patio reaches to the front yard\nand they =\r\nhave the whole horizon. We have a small piece of land to\nlive on and they h=\r\nave fields that go beyond our sight. We have\nservants who serve us, but the=\r\ny serve others. We buy our food, but\nthey grow theirs. We have walls around=\r\n our property to protect us,\nthey have friends to protect them.&quot;\n\nThe boy&#39;s=\r\n father was speechless.\n\nThen his son added, &quot;Thanks, Dad, for showing me h=\r\now poor we are.&quot;\n\nIsn&#39;t perspective a wonderful thing? Makes you wonder wha=\r\nt would\nhappen if we all gave thanks for everything we have, instead of\nwor=\r\nrying about what we don&#39;t have.\n\nAppreciate every single thing you have, an=\r\nd most of all the One who\nhas given it all to you.\n\nRegards\nShiva\n\n\n\n"}}
