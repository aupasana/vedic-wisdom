He and his wife knows about it. infact i=\r\n&#39;ve done many Chadi Paath recitations at his home and even my Maha Lakshmi =\r\nvratam if it happened to be a friday. Whenever i visit their home, his wife=\r\n sees to it that there is no Non veg food brought in his home.\nHe&#39;ll offer =\r\nhis Namaz ritual at my home. so Homam and Namaz will go parallelly. This pa=\r\nrallel of different rituals has a meeting point in both of our hearts. sadl=\r\ny in the view of the people like Dr. Zakir Naik, they run 180 degree apart =\r\nin different directions or actually they try to make it such that they neve=\r\nr meet.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, raja=\r\nrshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If you are=\r\n asking specifically about Bulle Shah, he was a Sufi saint of the 15th Cent=\r\nury in area of modern Pakisthan. As you can well understand from his poetry=\r\n, his realization was quite different from traditional Islamic learning. Bu=\r\nlle Shah was quite disliked by muslims of his time. He was a pacifist and a=\r\n true saint.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Most people consider Sufism or Sufiana=C2=A0to be a=\r\n branch of Islam. My personal view is different. In most of the poetry I ha=\r\nve read of famous Sufi sants like Jal=C4=81l ad-D=C4=ABn Mu=E1=B8=A5ammad B=\r\nalkh=C4=AB Rumi convince me that their personal realization was quite diffe=\r\nrent from Islamic doctrins. As such the roots of the Sufi philosphy like in=\r\n pre Islamic Persian and India. The mystics of these areas, specially Persi=\r\na, after it was over run by Islam, in order to protect their philosophy gar=\r\nbed it with Islamic terminologies and names. Otherwise they would have face=\r\nd sure shot slaughter. That was a means of self preservation which in turn,=\r\n over years, helped a lot of muslims in treading a more sublime path - IMHO=\r\n -=C2=A0than that which comes from the Ahadiths and the Koran proper.\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; For example Rumi talks a about something similar to=C2=A0reincarnatio=\r\nn in some of his poems while the following one does talk about communion wi=\r\nth God:\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I searched for God among the Christians and on the Cross=\r\n and therein I found Him not.\n&gt; I went into the ancient temples of idolatry=\r\n; no trace of Him was there.\n&gt; I entered the mountain cave of Hira and then=\r\n went as far as Qandhar but God I found not.\n&gt; With set purpose I fared to =\r\nthe summit of Mount Caucasus and found there only &#39;anqa&#39;s habitation.\n&gt; The=\r\nn I directed my search to the Kaaba, the resort of old and young; God was n=\r\not there even.\n&gt; Turning to philosophy I inquired about him from ibn Sina b=\r\nut found Him not within his range.\n&gt; I fared then to the scene of the Proph=\r\net&#39;s experience of a great divine manifestation only a &quot;two bow-lengths&#39; di=\r\nstance from him&quot; but God was not there even in that exalted court.\n&gt; Finall=\r\ny, I looked into my own heart and there I saw Him; He was nowhere else.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Communion with God is an idea impossible is the Islam of Muhammed.=\r\n The creator is always seperate from the creation.Period. Anything else is =\r\nKufr. Though in later verses Rumi did eulogize Muhammed and the Koran, my i=\r\nnterpretation is that all that was an attempt at disguising Kufr with an Is=\r\nlamic garb. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The person who changed the life of Rumi wa=\r\ns also another Sufi called=C2=A0 Shams-e-Tabrizi. Vimalananda mentions a po=\r\npular legend which says Shams was so powerful that he couild raise the dead=\r\n. One day the mullas caught up with him and asked him to demonstrate. Shams=\r\n went to a dead body and said, &quot;In the name of Allah, wake up!&quot;. But nothin=\r\ng happened. He tried a few times and yet nothing happened. Finally he said,=\r\n &quot;In my name, wake up!&quot; and the dead body woke up. Immediate the Mulla caug=\r\nht him for doing Kufr - ideally you cannot invoke anyone for help other tha=\r\nn Allah as per true Islam - and executed him.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Same was with case=\r\n with Mansur-al-Hallaj who was executed for proclaiming Anal Haq which lite=\r\nrally means I am the Truth. This statement is also considered Kufr as per t=\r\nraditional Islam. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Auliya Nizamuddin was another great Sufi who =\r\nintroduced Qwaalis in India. It is said he had advised the mother of Shivaj=\r\ni to worship lord Shiva for a son before Shivaji was born.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Gener=\r\nally, except for the famous=C2=A0Moinunddin Chisti of Ajmer, I have deep re=\r\nspect for most Sufis saint. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Though Sufis always showed a differ=\r\nent more subjective interpretation of Koran, however the genuine Muslim sch=\r\nolars were never fooled. Most of them considered Sufis to be non Islamic. E=\r\nven today. And I do not blame them. An honest reading of the Koran and the =\r\nhadiths with tell you in no uncertain terms that the philosophy of Vedanta =\r\nor any sort of God communion is unacceptable to Islam. I won&#39;t digress into=\r\n my views of what ails Islam, but Sufis can be safely called unIslamic if a=\r\n true, traditional and authentic version of Islam is to be followed.\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; BTW, Sufi ideas are quite famous in modern day cities where we find t=\r\nhe fashionably spiritual higher middle class. But like most things under th=\r\ne sun, they hardly know anything about anything.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; \n&gt; --- =\r\nOn Thu, 19/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: vedi=\r\nc_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Poetry of Bulle S=\r\nhah - Sufi\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, 19 November=\r\n, 2009, 5:21 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Some years =\r\nback this specific poem of Baba Bulle Shah - a sufi &gt;mystic\n&gt; \n&gt; can you pr=\r\novid me knowledge of this Sufi sect. is it one of the branch from Islam?.
