The location of the retrograde Mars, acc=\r\nording to house position and sign, would differentiate what qualities of Ma=\r\nrs would be emphasized and what qualities would be negated. Often, house po=\r\nsition and sign involvement tend to stress certain qualities of a planet mo=\r\nre than others, and this is where correlation and discrimination enter into=\r\n the delineation of the planet, whether direct or retrograde.\n\nTo read the =\r\nfull article please visit--\nhttp://bharatiyajyotishmantrasaadhana.blogspot.=\r\ncom/\nhttp://bharatiyajyotishmantrasaadhana.blogspot.com/\n\n\n"}}
