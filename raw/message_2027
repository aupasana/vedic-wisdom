I am posting it here for an=\r\nyone interested.\n=C2=A0\nNear the beginning of the 20th century the great In=\r\ndian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth=\r\n which had not been expressed before. In his high states of divine union he=\r\n saw that the time had come for a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He=\r\n saw that the divine was to manifest right here on Earth and that the time =\r\nfor this divine emergence into Earth life was now. He spoke of heaven desce=\r\nnding to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic =\r\nresistance held within her material body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=\r\n=BF=BD\n=EF=BF=BD\nSri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a Frenc=\r\nh mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother. Together the=\r\ny embarked on a journey of intensive cellular transformation that is very r=\r\nelevant to the colossal uncertainties we face today.\n=EF=BF=BD\nSri Aurobind=\r\no saw that the divine force permeates all matter, and that all matter there=\r\nfore has a force of consciousness. The process of the divine spirit descend=\r\ning down into matter is called involution. The process by which the divine =\r\nascends back upwards out of matter is called evolution. According to Sri Au=\r\nrobindo, humanity has reached a stage where these two events are occurring =\r\nsimultaneously, and in his inner visions, he foresaw that we would soon be =\r\nexperiencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) =\r\nconsciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change everything on Earth.\n=EF=\r\n=BF=BD\nMan=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, bu=\r\nt in what he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even=\r\n if seldom active in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, =\r\neven if obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personal=\r\nity. There is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the ou=\r\nter senses seems to contradict it.\n\nSri Aurobindo recognized that humankind=\r\n is going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reached in which=\r\n the human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, but is left ho=\r\npelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, =\r\nas the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a consciousness higher th=\r\nan the human rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind, has recently =\r\nbeen established in the fields of the Earth, and is active there. Our task =\r\nnow is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.\n\nEvolution took a grea=\r\nt leap forward with the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mi=\r\nnd. We are now at the threshold of another leap forward, even more momentou=\r\ns, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks a=\r\nbout four stages of human evolution, which we will soon be starting to expe=\r\nrience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=\r\n=BD our current species, a rational being possessing an individualized soul=\r\n, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging with it.\n=EF=BF=BD\nNex=\r\nt is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly c=\r\noming to birth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, =\r\na being that is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rath=\r\ner than mind-consciousness. \n=C2=A0\nThirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=\r\n=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will be in possession=\r\n of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness that has begun to=\r\n merge with cellular consciousness. \n=C2=A0\nFinally, our ultimate goal as a=\r\n species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fu=\r\nlly within the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what we coul=\r\nd call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of m=\r\natter and spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.\n\nThe great work of Sri=\r\n Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousness down in=\r\nto the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a unified =\r\nconsciousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was simultaneo=\r\nusly being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the=\r\n moment when it would flower into its full manifestation in collective matt=\r\ner.\nWhenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding re=\r\nsistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their experience with the f=\r\nour =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in th=\r\ne world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The =\r\nAsura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are s=\r\no outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in control of current global eve=\r\nnts. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a =\r\ntransformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering has returned to Source,=\r\n and so only the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interesti=\r\nngly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD thr=\r\nough Hitler during World War II, and of their own intensive inner work in c=\r\nountering his influence. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asu=\r\nra may be influencing other world leaders in the current political sphere.\n=\r\n\nWith the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete =\r\nhuman structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that=\r\n although the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catast=\r\nrophic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world fo=\r\nr the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained,=\r\n carried a power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by m=\r\neans other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually =\r\nbe absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Trut=\r\nh. It may be interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world t=\r\noday, the destruction we might have experienced if not for this power of ha=\r\nrmonization!\n\nWhen does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother belie=\r\nved that the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and that it was =\r\nquite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transformation=\r\n was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a minimum of destru=\r\nction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She s=\r\naid that the year 2000 would be a turning point.\n=C2=A0\nThis was a very int=\r\neresting read and matches what Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the=\r\n world.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n\nThe upsurge (of consciousnes=\r\ns) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Cricket on your mind?

I am posting it here for anyone interested.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT =\r\nface=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Near the beginning of the 20=\r\nth century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, b=\r\negan to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In his high st=\r\nates of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in the e=\r\nvolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right here on E=\r\narth and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life was now. H=\r\ne spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdow=\r\nn due to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body towards thi=\r\ns =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Sri Aurobindo was joined in Po=\r\nndicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known=\r\n as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive cellular t=\r\nransformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties we face t=\r\noday.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all=\r\n matter, and that all matter therefore has a force of\n consciousness. The p=\r\nrocess of the divine spirit descending down into matter is called involutio=\r\nn. The process by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is ca=\r\nlled evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage wh=\r\nere these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions=\r\n, he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called=\r\n =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entire=\r\nly change everything on Earth.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is n=\r\not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An imm=\r\nortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people, w=\r\nhile an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by =\r\nthe hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a great divine plan i=\r\nn motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Aurobindo recognized =\r\nthat humankind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been re=\r\nached in which the human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, =\r\nbut is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a specie=\r\ns. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a conscious=\r\nness higher than the human rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind,=\r\n has recently been established in the fields of the Earth, and is active th=\r\nere. Our task now is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Evolution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and la=\r\nter with the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap=\r\n forward, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Super=\r\nmind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we w=\r\nill soon be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =\r\n=EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being posse=\r\nssing an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and me=\r\nrging with it.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a=\r\n species that is spontaneous- ly coming to birth under the influence of an =\r\never-expanding supramental field, a being that is largely able to merge and=\r\n live from soul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nFONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thirdly is the =EF=BF=\r\n=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will=\r\n be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness =\r\nthat has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Finally, our ultimate goal as a =\r\nspecies is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated ful=\r\nly within the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what we could=\r\n call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of ma=\r\ntter and spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The grea=\r\nt work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciou=\r\nsness down into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this =\r\nis a unified consciousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness w=\r\nas simultaneously being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth,=\r\n awaiting the moment when it would flower into its full manifestation in co=\r\nllective matter.&lt;BR&gt;Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is =\r\ncorresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their exper=\r\nience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine force=\r\ns, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of=\r\n Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the f=\r\norces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in control of cu=\r\nrrent global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has=\r\n gone through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering has\n re=\r\nturned to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on=\r\n Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanne=\r\nling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own intensiv=\r\ne inner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficult to see =\r\nhow this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the current p=\r\nolitical sphere.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;With the descent of this new vibratory cons=\r\nciousness all our old obsolete human structures will be demolished. However=\r\n, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes will be enormous they =\r\nwould not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automatically era=\r\nses Falsehood, and our world for the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, =\r\nthe Supramental, he maintained, carried a power of harmonization which coul=\r\nd overcome this resistance by means other than dramatic struggle and violen=\r\nce. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their original emanations o=\r\nf Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to speculate, with =\r\nall the violence in the world today, the destruction we might have experien=\r\nced if not for this power of harmonization!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;When does all=\r\n this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother believed that the world stage wa=\r\ns set for this quantum descent, and that it was quite imminent. The Mother =\r\nsaid in 1968 that the supramental transformation was a certainty now, and t=\r\nhat it would come about with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough th=\r\nis minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 woul=\r\nd be a turning point.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;This was a ve=\r\nry interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji says about changes coming =\r\nin the world.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D=\r\n2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPA=\r\nN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;The upsurge (of c=\r\nonsciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;=\r\n&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Love Cricket?
