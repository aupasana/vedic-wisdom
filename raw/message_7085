Some actually started doing homam after=\r\n the dream and some\n&gt; said their lives were transformed after the dream. On=\r\ne person, for example,\n&gt; cleared a tough & important exam after doing badly=\r\n in the mock exams. As I\n&gt; never thought of these people (and did not even =\r\nknow of some of them!), I\n&gt; obviously had no direct influence on the dreams=\r\n they had. The dreams were\n&gt; creations of their own minds. The character ca=\r\nlled &quot;Narasimha&quot; who came in\n&gt; their dreams and transformed their lives, is=\r\n a being built in their own\n&gt; minds. Based on their reading of my writings =\r\nand based on their own mental\n&gt; conditioning, they created a powerful chara=\r\ncter called &quot;Narasimha&quot; in their\n&gt; sub-conscious minds, who is a very good =\r\nsadhaka and guru and having the\n&gt; ability to transform people. That powerfu=\r\nl character (and not me!) came in\n&gt; their dreams and transformed their live=\r\ns!\n&gt;\n&gt; Same thing applies to someone who takes me as guru and becomes reali=\r\nzed.\n&gt; Based on my writings and words and their own mental conditioning, if=\r\n someone\n&gt; succeeds in creating a powerful character called &quot;Narasimha&quot; in =\r\ntheir own\n&gt; mind and lets him affect them positively, they can make great s=\r\npiritual\n&gt; progress. But then, that character is not really me! If someone =\r\nsays &quot;you\n&gt; are my guru&quot;, &quot;you gave me so and so&quot;, &quot;you affected me in so a=\r\nnd so way&quot;, I\n&gt; will understand that a powerful character they constructed =\r\nin their minds,\n&gt; with a little input from me, did all of that!\n&gt;\n&gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, one specific example stands out. In this case, the pe=\r\nrson did not know\n&gt; me, never heard of me and did not know of my website. T=\r\nhis person just had a\n&gt; dream in which someone came and said, &quot;I am Narasim=\r\nha Rao. You do so and so\n&gt; homam with so and so mantra&quot; and gave a mantra. =\r\nThis person remembered the\n&gt; dream and did a google search next morning and=\r\n landed on my website. The\n&gt; photo in my website apparently matches the per=\r\nson in the dream. This\n&gt; surprised the person and gave faith.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, I =\r\nhad no clue and did not know this person at all. So, rationally\n&gt; speaking,=\r\n I had no role to play in this! In this case, this person did not\n&gt; even re=\r\nad my emails or other writings and hence &quot;I&quot; had no direct or\n&gt; indirect ro=\r\nle in the dream. The phenomenon that a character called\n&gt; &quot;Narasimha Rao&quot; w=\r\nas constructed in that person&#39;s sub-conscious mind with\n&gt; some similarities=\r\n with me (looks and spiritual interest) is interesting, but\n&gt; does not mean=\r\n that character is me. Either the person did know about me\n&gt; sometime back =\r\nand forgot (but remembered sub-consciously), or some force up\n&gt; there manip=\r\nulated that mind. In either case, it is not of my doing and the\n&gt; character=\r\n in the dream is a creation of that force and that mind and not me.\n&gt;\n&gt; *  =\r\n      *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Bottomline is that there are notions in the minds of p=\r\neople who met us in\n&gt; some manner (and possibly even in people who did not =\r\nmeet us), which we may\n&gt; be tempted to identify with and say &quot;that is I&quot;. P=\r\nositive and negative\n&gt; comments on those notional beings give us pride and =\r\nshame, happiness and\n&gt; sadness! How weird!\n&gt;\n&gt; As you cling on to more and =\r\nmore identities, you are stuck more and more.\n&gt; If you think logically and =\r\nimpassionately, you will see that all these\n&gt; characters are someone else&#39;s=\r\n creations and different from you. So they are\n&gt; not &quot;I&quot;. As you drop off o=\r\nne identity after another, you become very light.\n&gt; Your mind becomes very =\r\nclear.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, let us come to a fundamental questi=\r\non. We saw that the notions of\n&gt; &quot;Narasimha&quot; in the minds of people are not=\r\n based on objective reality alone\n&gt; and based on their own conditioning and=\r\n created (and grown over time!) in\n&gt; their own minds! Now, what about the n=\r\notion of &quot;Narasimha&quot; in my own mind?\n&gt; Is that based on objective reality o=\r\nr is it also created (and grown over\n&gt; time!) in my own mind based on my ow=\r\nn conditioning? If so, who is the real\n&gt; &quot;I&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; I will let you contemplat=\r\ne on it!\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish L=\r\nessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam=\r\n and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;http=\r\n://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://Sa=\r\nraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/&gt;\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\r\n--20cf307d04840cb1f504aa32a6f6\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;You are a catalyst of change, that =\r\nis all.

Some actually started doing =\r\nhomam after the dream and some said their lives were transformed after the =\r\ndream. One person, for example, cleared a tough &amp; important exam after =\r\ndoing badly in the mock exams. As I never thought of these people (and did =\r\nnot even know of some of them!), I obviously had no direct influence on the=\r\n dreams they had. The dreams were creations of their own minds. The charact=\r\ner called &quot;Narasimha&quot; who came in their dreams and transformed th=\r\neir lives, is a being built in their own minds. Based on their reading of m=\r\ny writings and based on their own mental conditioning, they created a power=\r\nful character called &quot;Narasimha&quot; in their sub-conscious minds, wh=\r\no is a very good sadhaka and guru and having the ability to transform peopl=\r\ne. That powerful character (and not me!) came in their dreams and transform=\r\ned their lives!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; s=\r\nize=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=\r\n=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;Same thing applies to someone who =\r\ntakes me as guru and becomes realized. Based on my writings and words and t=\r\nheir own mental conditioning, if someone succeeds in creating a powerful ch=\r\naracter called &quot;Narasimha&quot; in their own mind and lets him affect =\r\nthem positively, they can make great spiritual progress. But then, that cha=\r\nracter is not really me! If someone says &quot;you are my guru&quot;, &quot=\r\n;you gave me so and so&quot;, &quot;you affected me in so and so way&quot;,=\r\n I will understand that a powerful character they constructed in their mind=\r\ns, with a little input from me, did all of that!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div align=\r\n=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;=\r\n&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D=\r\n&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;No=\r\nw, one specific example stands out. In this case, the person did not know m=\r\ne, never heard of me and did not know of my website. This person just had a=\r\n dream in which someone came and said, &quot;I am Narasimha Rao. You do so =\r\nand so homam with so and so mantra&quot; and gave a mantra. This person rem=\r\nembered the dream and did a google search next morning and landed on my web=\r\nsite. The photo in my website apparently matches the person in the dream. T=\r\nhis surprised the person and gave faith.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div a=\r\nlign=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;Again, I =\r\nhad no clue and did not know this person at all. So, rationally speaking, I=\r\n had no role to play in this! In this case, this person did not even read m=\r\ny emails or other writings and hence &quot;I&quot; had no direct or indirec=\r\nt role in the dream. The phenomenon that a character called &quot;Narasimha=\r\n Rao&quot; was constructed in that person&#39;s sub-conscious mind with som=\r\ne similarities with me (looks and spiritual interest) is interesting, but d=\r\noes not mean that character is me. Either the person did know about me some=\r\ntime back and forgot (but remembered sub-consciously), or some force up the=\r\nre manipulated that mind. In either case, it is not of my doing and the cha=\r\nracter in the dream is a creation of that force and that mind and not me.&lt;/=\r\nfont&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D=\r\n&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *&lt;/fo=\r\nnt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Ve=\r\nrdana&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D=\r\n&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;Bottomline is that there are notions in the minds of p=\r\neople who met us in some manner (and possibly even in people who did not me=\r\net us), which we may be tempted to identify with and say &quot;that is I&qu=\r\not;. Positive and negative comments on those notional beings give us pride =\r\nand shame, happiness and sadness!

If you=\r\n think logically and impassionately, you will see that all these characters=\r\n are someone else&#39;s creations and different from you. So they are not &=\r\nquot;I&quot;.

We saw that the notions of &quot;Narasimha&quot=\r\n; in the minds of people are not based on objective reality alone and based=\r\n on their own conditioning and created (and grown over time!) in their own =\r\nminds! Now, what about the notion of &quot;Narasimha&quot; in my own mind? =\r\nIs that based on objective reality or is it also created (and grown over ti=\r\nme!) in my own mind based on my own conditioning?
