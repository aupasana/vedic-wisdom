I will =\r\nperhaps get the kunda made through an order and start performing homam soon=\r\n. I am very much interested to make homam a part of my life as I have made =\r\nmantras.\n\nI find your teachings very true regarding the frequency of homam/=\r\nmantras. I have been doing mantras for 7-8 years now and see that without d=\r\noing it regularly, it is not possible to maintain the energy created. Also =\r\nwhat you taught about the power of homam is very true, that it is a lot mor=\r\ne stronger than mantra. I can say this because I had the opportunity to tak=\r\ne part in a homam while staying in Maharashtra with a Brahmin family.\n\nI ha=\r\nve just a few more questions though -\n\n1) You have mentioned about kumkum/v=\r\nermillion. I am not sure what it means. I searched quite a lot here and the=\r\ny sale kumkum as a dense liquid used for women&#39;s make up, applied with a sm=\r\nall brush. No kumkum is available in powder form anywhere. I looked up in l=\r\nocal dictionary and it says &#39;vermillion&#39; means &#39;sindoor&#39;... which married H=\r\nindu ladies apply above forehead, in the middle, just inside their hair bor=\r\nder. So I just bought the &#39;sindoor&#39; powder. Is it the right thing?\n\n2) By t=\r\nurmeric powder, did you mean the same turmeric powder that is used in cooki=\r\nng? Can I simply use that?\n\n3) Is it compulsory to draw the two parallel re=\r\nd lines with kumkum to connect homam kunda with my seat? I ask this silly q=\r\nuestion because I am planning to arrange a mat on the floor and do homam ov=\r\ner it.\n\n4) An important question I forgot to ask. How do I count the no. of=\r\n repetition of mantras in &#39;Pradhana Homam&#39;, esp if I repeat 108 times? Can =\r\nI keep counting with my left fingers while offering ahutis with right hand?=\r\n I mean, each finger is divided into three parts so counting the two border=\r\ns and the base and the top of the finger, each finger can be used to count =\r\n4 (four). Can I count this way, or there are some other &#39;pure&#39; ways in trad=\r\nition to count the repetition?\n\nThanks\nTanvir\n\n\n"}}
