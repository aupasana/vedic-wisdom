Praying by one with a =\r\ngood level of internal purity can work \n&gt; better. A brahmana choosing this =\r\nline of work should be mentally \n&gt; detached from the supposed benefits from=\r\n it, i.e. the money paid or \n&gt; gifts given. He need not refuse fee/gifts, b=\r\nut, at the same time, fixing \n&gt; a price is not the brahmana way. It is the =\r\nvaisya way. A brahma should \n&gt; pray for those he wants to help and then tak=\r\ne whatever is given in \n&gt; return. One person may give a million dollars and=\r\n another may give one \n&gt; cent and one should not look at it differently. TH=\r\nAT is true brahmana \n&gt; dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; The policy of today&#39;s temples is not re=\r\nally in tune with brahmana \n&gt; dharma. Then what&#39;s the point in advising on =\r\nwhether to pay for one \n&gt; archana or for multiple archanas, when taking mul=\r\ntiple names? The whole \n&gt; thing is quite messed up anyway. Many temples hav=\r\ne become places of \n&gt; business and unconducive to following brahmana dharma=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; My suggestion is this. Don&#39;t look at temples as places of dharmik \n&gt;=\r\n excellence or spiritual purity, which can solve your problems. Look at \n&gt; =\r\nthem as social/cultural centers where people of a similar interest meet \n&gt; =\r\nand try to preserve culture and religion and also where some learned men \n&gt;=\r\n try to follow some dharma. Go there and buy their services (e.g. \n&gt; archan=\r\nas) to encourage them, with no expectations of any result. \n&gt; Regarding how=\r\n many names to give, give how many ever names the priests \n&gt; accepts withou=\r\nt getting irritated. In the end, it may not matter. But \n&gt; who knows? In an=\r\ny case, you can also mentally think of people you care \n&gt; about while the s=\r\nankalpa is being taken. God does have access to your \n&gt; thoughts also and d=\r\noes not rely only on the externally produced sounds \n&gt; to know your sankalp=\r\na!\n&gt; \n&gt; If you find a sincere priest in whom you get faith, give him whatev=\r\ner \n&gt; you can afford and give it happily. If the archana costs $30 but you =\r\ncan \n&gt; afford $200 comfortably, give $200. Sincere priests trying to follow=\r\n \n&gt; brahmana dharma are so rare now-a-days, that we must encourage and \n&gt; s=\r\nupport them. It will benefit the world (and us) immensely in the long \n&gt; ru=\r\nn.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Apr 21, 2012 at 3:59 PM, marell=\r\na78 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Respected members,\n&gt; \n&gt; Kindly comment on significa=\r\nnce of Archana done at temples.
