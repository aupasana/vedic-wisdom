He was a very pious soul.\nEveryone trusted him and loved him. He used to sell his goods in the\nmarket-place.When a customer asked him the price of a cloth,the weaver would\nsay: &quot;By the will of Rama the price of the yarn is one rupee and the labour\nfour annas; by the will of Rama the profit is two annas.\n\nThe price of the cloth, by the will of Rama, is one rupee and six annas.&quot;\nSuch was the people&#39;s faith in the weaver that the customer would at once\npay the price and take the cloth, The weaver was a real devotee of God.\nAfter finishing his supper in the evening, he would spend long hours in the\nworship hall meditating on God and chanting His name and glories. Now, late\none night the weaver couldn&#39;t sleep. He was sitting in the worship hall,\nsmoking,now and then, when a band of robbers happened\nto pass that way.\n\nThey wanted a man to carry their goods and said to the weaver, &quot;Come with\nus.&quot; So saying, they led him off by the hand. After committing a robbery in\na house, they put a load of things on the weaver&#39;s head commanding him to\ncarry them. Suddenly the police arrived and the robbers ran away. But the\nweaver, with his load,was arrested. He was kept in the lock-up for the\nnight.\n\nNext day he was brought before the magistrate for trial. The villagers\nlearnt what had happened and came to the court. They said to the magistrate,\n&quot;Your Honour, this man could never commit robbery.&quot; Thereupon the magistrate\nasked the weaver to make his statement.\n\nThe weaver said: &quot;Your Honour, by the will of Rama I finished my meal at\nnight. Then by the will of Rama I was sitting in the worship hall. It was\nquite late at night by the will of Rama. By the will of Rama I had been\nthinking of God and chanting His name and glories, when by the will of Rama\na band of robbers passed that way. By the will of Rama they dragged me with\nthem; by the will of Rama they committed a robbery in a house; and by the\nwill of Rama they put a load on my head. Just then, by the will of Rama the\npolice arrived and by the will of Rama was arrested. Then by the will of\nRama the police kept me in the lock-up for the night, and this morning by\nthe will of Rama I have been brought before Your Honour.&quot;\n\nThe magistrate realized that the weaver was a pious man and ordered his\nrelease. On his way home the weaver said to his friends, &quot;By the will of\nRama I have been released.&quot;\n\nWhether you live in the world or renounce it,everything depends upon the\nwill of Rama. Throwing your whole responsibility upon God, do your work in\nthe world.\n\nSource: Tales and Parables of Sri Ramakrishna\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--000e0cd1ab6ac1b15c047ad4cb1e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nIN a certain village there lived a weaver.
