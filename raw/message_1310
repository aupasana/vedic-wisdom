Considering your reflections on the same, I was sanguine \n=\r\nthat may be those emotional disturbances were a result of certain \nkarmas a=\r\nccelerating and arriving before time.\n\nHence i was a little scared and tens=\r\ned...and what was on priority \ntoday while doing the homa was to burn those=\r\n unburnt portions. \nInterestingly...I sat to do the homa...did my sankalpa.=\r\n..ahutis \nstarted and all that...when i heard this distinct voice \n(admonis=\r\nhingly)from within me (i guess) which said &quot;your priority is \nnot me...but =\r\nburning off that piece of wood?&quot;. Now this was \nsomething that embarassed m=\r\ne to the core...\n\nI said sorry...and went on to concentrate on the task at =\r\n\nhand...though could not fully concentrate partly because i was still \nappr=\r\nehensive of the offerings were properly burning or not and \npartly because =\r\nI was still reeling from embarassment.\n\nThis is what I wanted to share with=\r\n you and also the members of the \nforum\n\nRegards\nArunisha\n\n\n"}}
