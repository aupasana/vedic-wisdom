They may sometimes seem to &quot;read your mind&quot; and address what=\r\n you are thinking, without you saying anything. Some of you may even develo=\r\np such an ability in future. Even if intuition is not good in general, it m=\r\nay become very good with certain people or certain matters.\n=A0\nI want to s=\r\nay a few words about such phenomena and say a few words of caution.\n=A0\n*=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nSome people are more &quot;aw=\r\nare&quot; in their intuition, while some people are not so aware and simply reso=\r\nnate to others&#39; thoughts without awareness.\n=A0\nAs an example, someone I kn=\r\now does homam everyday and is a regular and rational person without an imag=\r\ninative/intuitive mind that gets visions, dreams etc.\n=A0\nThough his sadhan=\r\na was saattwik (even his visualization of fierce deities was in Upanishadic=\r\n terms), oneday he felt a strong urge to mix blood in rice and offer it in =\r\nhomam. It did not seem natural to him and so he did not act on that instinc=\r\nt though it re-appeared in his mind several times that day. He ignored it a=\r\ns an unnatural thought for him.\n=A0\nA couple of days later, he received a m=\r\nail from someone close to him but living 1000s of miles away. This person h=\r\nappened to go to a smashan that weekend night for meditation and saw some T=\r\nantriks doing a\n &quot;Rakta Chamunda&quot; homam. They were offering ingredients dip=\r\nped in their blood in homam. He just sat there and observed them. He later =\r\nsent a mail about it.\n=A0\nWhen the original person received the mail, he re=\r\nalized why he had that thought a couple of days back. His mind was simply r=\r\nesonating to the thoughts of the other person, without a complete awareness=\r\n. In fact, such a thing happened to him several times with the same person.=\r\n\n=A0\nThere were also many occasions when he would randomly talk about some =\r\ntopic and one specific person in the room would claim that that person was =\r\nthinking about exactly that topic. Again, the question in the mind of that =\r\nperson resonated in the other mind and the person started talking about it.=\r\n\n\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nFirst, how does t=\r\nhis work? Simple - resonance between minds.\n=A0\nSuppose you are talking lou=\r\nd. You may not hear what others around you are saying. Similarly, if your m=\r\nind is vibrating with too many thoughts, it may not resonate to the vibrati=\r\nons in other minds around it.\n=A0\nBut, if you are relatively calm, you can =\r\nhear what others are saying. Similarly, if your mind is relatively calm, it=\r\n may pick up vibrations in other minds around it (or even 1000s of miles aw=\r\nay if there is some attachment/connection) and resonate to those vibrations=\r\n!\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nSecond, how to kn=\r\now where the thought is coming from?\n=A0\nWhen an infant listens to tens of =\r\nvoices, he simply hears different sounds and does not know from which face =\r\neach sound is coming from. Over time, after many observations and correlati=\r\nons, brain learns to discern from which face each sound is coming from. Lat=\r\ner, one may recognize a voice even when the face is behind a curtain or oth=\r\nerwise invisible!\n=A0\nSimilarly, if one so wishes, one can develop the abil=\r\nity to discern the source of each thought that vibrates the mind, after muc=\r\nh observation and correlation. The mind can of course be trained. However, =\r\na seeker of self-realization need not actively pursue such an ability, for =\r\nit serves no useful purpose in Self-realization.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nThe ability to \ncalm the vibrations in the mi=\r\nnd due to conditioning and then the ability to calm any vibrations due to r=\r\nesonance is more important than the \nability to discern the source of vibra=\r\ntions.\n=A0\nWhether a thought that vibrates one&#39;s mind right now is coming f=\r\nrom one&#39;s own conditioning or sensory observation or someone else&#39;s, is not=\r\n the crux. The crux is knowing whether one should perform any physical/ment=\r\nal *action* based on thought, to fulfill one&#39;s swa-dharma, or just observe =\r\nthe thought and leave it (move on). A true seeker&#39;s focus will be on that a=\r\nbility, i.e. developing clarity regarding one&#39;s own dharma, than figuring o=\r\nut the source of each thought. The latter can be a distraction or even an e=\r\ngo trap.\n=A0\nNevertheless, Nature may sometimes give one abilities that one=\r\n does not actively pursue or need (perhaps because one desired it long back=\r\n). A true seeker neither tries for nor resists what is not needed by one. O=\r\nne does not dwell on it in either case and moves on.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nOne may argue that certain special abil=\r\nities can help one pay off karmik debts on one&#39;s way to liberation. However=\r\n, one can (must) trust Nature to arrange for circumstances to pay off one&#39;s=\r\n debts. The key is to be aware of what one can give others in any given cir=\r\ncumstance and give it without holding back. If one gets used to giving with=\r\nout expecting any payback, Nature will automatically arrange for all of one=\r\n&#39;s debts to be paid off. No special abilities are needed.\n=A0\nOf course, wh=\r\nen there is a clash between giving thing X to person A vs giving thing Y to=\r\n person B, one needs to use one&#39;s discretion. That is where our conditionin=\r\ng may block us from the right call. As we know our dharma better and get a =\r\nsense of which of our dharmas are higher, we may start to make the right ca=\r\nlls.\n=A0\nThe bottomline: Try to know your dharma (declared by the spark of =\r\ndivinity in heart). Try to follow it to the best of ability. Give whatever =\r\nyou can give others, without expecting any payback. Ignore thoughts arising=\r\n in mind, which do not contribute to fulfillment of your dharma, no matter =\r\nwhat the source of that thought may be.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nBefore I sign off, a couple of words on Rakta Chamund=\r\na from the story above.\n=A0\nThe verb cham means to \ndrink/eat/consume. The =\r\nverb mund means to shave or deplete. Chamunda \nmeans one who drinks and fin=\r\nishes. Rakta means conditioning or coloring \n(the words rakti (attachment) =\r\nand virakti (detachment) come from the \nsame root). Rakta Chamunda is the o=\r\nne who drinks and empties all \nconditioning that causes desires. Offering b=\r\nlood is an approximation. Also, ironic that some people worship Rakta Chamu=\r\nnda for vashikaran..\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spiri=\r\ntuality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\r\n---1999499579-139601118-1375066402=:21945\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica,=\r\n sans-serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv259588=\r\n4606yui_3_7_2_3201_1373624150759_66&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_3201=\r\n_1373624150759_67&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_3201_1373624150759_55&quot; s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans=\r\n-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606y=\r\nui_3_7_2_2741_1373624150759_65&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2741_1373=\r\n624150759_66&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2741_1373624150759_55 yiv2595=\r\n884606yui_3_7_2_3201_1373624150759_56&quot; style=3D&quot;color:#000;background-color=\r\n:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;=\r\nyiv2595884606&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2554_1373624150759_64&quot;&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv\n id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2554_1373624150759_65&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv25958846=\r\n06yui_3_7_2_2554_1373624150759_55 yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2741_1373624150759=\r\n_56 yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_3201_1373624150759_57&quot; style=3D&quot;color:#000;backg=\r\nround-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_55&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv259=\r\n5884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2554_1373624150759_56 yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2=\r\n_2741_1373624150759_57 yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_3201_1373624150759_58&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0,\n 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, s=\r\nans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv2595884=\r\n606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_70&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026=\r\n_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_=\r\n2554_1373624150759_57 yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2741_1373624150759_58 yiv25958=\r\n84606yui_3_7_2_3201_1373624150759_59&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_137=\r\n3624150759_74&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:=\r\narial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;You may find s=\r\nome people who have an unbelievably uncanny intuition.

Similarly, if your mind is relatively =\r\ncalm, it may pick up vibrations in other minds around it (or even 1000s of =\r\nmiles away if there is some attachment/connection) and resonate to those vi=\r\nbrations!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_202=\r\n6_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624=\r\n150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;y=\r\niv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Second, how to know where the thought is coming=\r\n from?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When an infant listens to tens of voices, he simply hea=\r\nrs different sounds and does not know from which face each sound is coming =\r\nfrom. Over time, after many observations and correlations, brain learns to =\r\ndiscern from which face each sound is coming from. Later, one may\n recogniz=\r\ne a voice even when the face is behind a curtain or otherwise invisible!&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, if one so wishes, one can develop the ability to disc=\r\nern the source of each thought that vibrates the mind, after much observati=\r\non and correlation. The mind can of course be trained. However, a seeker of=\r\n self-realization need not actively pursue such an ability, for it serves n=\r\no useful purpose in Self-realization.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv25=\r\n95884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606y=\r\nui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595=\r\n884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2=\r\n026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;The ability to \ncalm the vibrations in the mind due t=\r\no conditioning and then the ability\n to calm any vibrations due to resonanc=\r\ne is more important than the \nability to discern the source of vibrations.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_6=\r\n8&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Whether a thought that vibrates one&#39;s mind right now is coming fr=\r\nom one&#39;s own conditioning or sensory observation or someone else&#39;s, is not =\r\nthe crux. The crux is knowing whether one should perform any physical/menta=\r\nl *action* based on thought, to fulfill one&#39;s swa-dharma, or just observe t=\r\nhe thought and leave it (move on). A true seeker&#39;s focus will be on that ab=\r\nility, i.e. developing clarity regarding one&#39;s own dharma, than figuring ou=\r\nt the source of each thought. The latter can be a distraction or even an eg=\r\no trap.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Nevertheless, Nature may sometimes give one abilities =\r\nthat one does not actively pursue or need (perhaps because one desired it l=\r\nong back). A true seeker neither tries for nor resists what is not needed b=\r\ny one. One does not dwell on it in either case and moves on.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;&lt;span\n id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_137=\r\n3624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;On=\r\ne may argue that certain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_137=\r\n3624150759_68&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;sp=\r\necial &lt;/span&gt;abilities can help one pay off karmik debts on one&#39;s way to li=\r\nberation. However, one can (must) trust Nature to arrange for circumstances=\r\n to pay off one&#39;s debts. The key is to be aware of what one can give others=\r\n in any given circumstance and give it without holding back. If one gets us=\r\ned to giving without expecting any payback, Nature will automatically arran=\r\nge for all of one&#39;s debts to be paid off. No special abilities are needed.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Of course, when there is a clash between giving thing X to per=\r\nson A vs giving\n thing Y to person B, one needs to use one&#39;s discretion. Th=\r\nat is where our conditioning may block us from the right call. As we know o=\r\nur dharma better and get a sense of which of our dharmas are higher, we may=\r\n start to make the right calls.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The bottomline: Try to know yo=\r\nur dharma (declared by the spark of divinity in heart). Try to follow it to=\r\n the best of ability. Give whatever you can give others, without expecting =\r\nany payback. Ignore thoughts arising in mind, which do not contribute to fu=\r\nlfillment of your dharma, no matter what the source of that thought may be.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_=\r\n68&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span=\r\n id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_137362=\r\n4150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Befor=\r\ne I sign off, a\n couple of words on Rakta Chamunda from the story above.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150=\r\n759_68&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv2595884606yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;The=\r\n verb cham means to \ndrink/eat/consume.
