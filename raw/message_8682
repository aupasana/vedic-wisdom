Tanzi*, Ph.D., Joseph P. and Rose F. Kennedy Professor of Neurology =\r\nat\nHarvard University, and Director of the Genetics and Aging Research Unit=\r\n at\nMassachusetts General Hospital (MGH).\n\n\nThe greatest mystery of existen=\r\nce is existence itself. There is the\nexistence of the universe and there is=\r\n the existence of the awareness of\nexistence of the universe. Were it not f=\r\nor this awareness, even if the\nuniverse existed as an external reality, we =\r\nwould not be aware of its\nexistence, so it would for all practical purpose =\r\nnot exist. Traditional\nscience assumes, for the most part, that an objectiv=\r\ne observer independent\nreality exists; the universe, stars, galaxies, sun, =\r\nmoon and earth would\nstill be there if no one was looking. However, modern =\r\nquantum theory, the\nmost successful of all scientific creations of the huma=\r\nn mind, disagrees.\nThe properties of a particle, quantum theory tells us, d=\r\no not even exist\nuntil an observation takes place. Quantum theory disagrees=\r\n with\ntraditional, Newtonian physics. Most scientists, although respecting\n=\r\nquantum theory, do not follow its implications. The result is a kind of\nsch=\r\nizophrenia between what scientists believe and what they practice. When\nwe =\r\nexamine this hypothesis of traditional science, we find it more a\nmetaphysi=\r\ncal assumption than a scientific assertion.\n\nHow can we assert that an obse=\r\nrver-independent reality exists if the\nassertion itself is dependent on the=\r\n existence of a conscious observer?\nThis raises the additional dilemma of w=\r\nho or what is the observer and where\nis this observer located? When scienti=\r\nsts in general describe empirical\nfacts and formulate scientific theories, =\r\nthey forget that neither facts nor\ntheories are an insight into the true na=\r\nture of fundamental reality apart\nfrom any observer. What we consider to be=\r\n empirical facts are entirely\ndependent on observation, in agreement with q=\r\nuantum theory. The scientific\nobserver in this case is an activity of the u=\r\nniverse called Homo sapiens\nusually with a Ph.D. in physics, biology, neuro=\r\nscience or other branches of\nscience. However, many scientists have never r=\r\neally asked the question &quot;Who\nam I&quot;?\n\nMost neuroscientists who still don&#39;t =\r\nbelieve that quantum theory has\nanything to do with the brain, would assert=\r\n that &quot;I&quot;, the conscious\nobserver, is solely an epiphenomenon of the brain;=\r\n that consciousness is\nproduced by the brain, just as gastric juices are pr=\r\noduced by the stomach\nand bile is produced by the gall bladder. The problem=\r\n with this of course,\nis that any neuroscientist worth his/her tenure will =\r\ntell you that there is\nno satisfactory theory in neuroscience that explains=\r\n how neurochemistry\ntranslates into conscious experience. How do electroche=\r\nmical phenomena in\nthe brain create the appreciation of the beauty of a red=\r\n rose, the taste of\ngarlic, the smell of onions, the feeling of love, compa=\r\nssion, joy, insight,\nintuition, imagination, creativity, free will, or awar=\r\neness of existence of\nself and the universe? There is no physicalist theory=\r\n based on classical\nphysics to explain these subjective experiences. Nor, i=\r\ns there any obvious\nmeans for coming up with one.\n\n\nWhen traditional scienc=\r\ne finds itself in such an impasse it might be time\nto question some of the =\r\nbasic assumptions about so called\nindependently-existing reality. We must r=\r\nevisit the idea that science is a\nmethodology and not an ontology. Current =\r\nscience however is based on a\nphysicalist ontology. This is the basic belie=\r\nf that reality is physical and\nmind is an epiphenomenon of matter (the nerv=\r\nous system). Nonetheless we are\nbaffled when asked to explain how matter be=\r\ncomes mind. We suggest here a\nfundamental revision in our most cherished sc=\r\nientific assumptions. We\nboldly suggest that matter, force fields, particle=\r\ns, waves, even the fabric\nof space and time are not denizens of fundamental=\r\n reality but that they are\nperceptual and cognitive experiences in consciou=\r\nsness. Actually what we\npropose, would be in agreement with what most of th=\r\ne great physicists who\nfounded quantum theory almost a hundred years ago wo=\r\nuld hold. But we are\nalso going beyond, taking the statements of quantum th=\r\neory to the next\nlevel: All of physical reality is a perceptual experience =\r\nin consciousness\nalone. The experience may turn out to be different for dif=\r\nferent species.\n\nWhat is physical reality to a bat, a honey bee, a nematode=\r\n, a whale, a\ndolphin, an eagle, an insect with numerous eyes? There is no f=\r\nixed physical\nreality, no single perception of the world, just numerous way=\r\ns of\ninterpreting world views as dictated by one&#39;s nervous system and the\ns=\r\npecific environment of our planetary existence. We propose that the\nworldvi=\r\new of current science as its is being practiced, which operates from\nthe as=\r\nsumption that human perception and particularly facts emanating from\nobserv=\r\nations made with human scientific methods are the only fundamental\ntruth, i=\r\ns clearly flawed. Furthermore the subject / object split that is\nthe basic =\r\npremise of the current scientific methods has led to the creation\nof arguab=\r\nly detrimental technologies including mechanized death, petroleum\nproducts =\r\nin our food, genetically modified foods, global warming,\nextinction of spec=\r\nies, and even the possible extinction of the human\nspecies. Building on the=\r\n quantum view of the cosmos, which accepts a\nnon-local, entangled reality t=\r\nhat includes observers as fundamental, we\nsuggest the next natural step, a =\r\nnew science rooted in consciousness, one\nthat strives to interpret the enti=\r\nre universe, with all its observers, all\nmodes of observation, and all obje=\r\ncts observed as nothing other than\nconsciousness and it&#39;s manifestations!\nR=\r\nejecting what we believe is the most reasonable and rational approach\npropo=\r\nsed here, will lead nowhere and force us to accept randomness and lack\nof p=\r\nurpose as the hallmarks of the universe. Such a view is, ultimately,\nleadin=\r\ng to no meaning for our own very existence. We suggest that\nperceptual obje=\r\ncts experienced in consciousness, including our very brains,\nare not the so=\r\nurce of consciousness. We suggest rigorous testing of this\nradically differ=\r\nent ontology. We feel a holistic science that does not\nseparate observer fr=\r\nom that which is observed would lead to the unraveling\nof the mysteries of =\r\nthe universe which at presently seem beyond reach,\nleading to an understand=\r\ning of a conscious universe in which all are\ndifferentiated activities of a=\r\n single field that is an undivided wholeness\nand in some sense bridges exte=\r\nrnal reality with inner being.\n\n*Deepak Chopra*, MD, FACP, is the author of=\r\n the forthcoming book, God: A\nStory of Revelation&lt;http://www.amazon.com/God=\r\n-Story-Revelation-Deepak-Chopra/dp/0062020684/ref=3Dsr_1_1?s=3Dbooks&ie=3DU=\r\nTF8&qid=3D1346974949&sr=3D1-1&keywords=3Dgod+a+story+of+revelation/deepakch=\r\ncom07-20&gt;\n (HarperOne)\n\n*Menas Kafatos*, Ph.D., Fletcher Jones Endowed Prof=\r\nessor in Computational\nPhysics, Chapman University, co author with Deepak C=\r\nhopra of the\nforthcoming book, Who Made God and Other Cosmic Riddles.
