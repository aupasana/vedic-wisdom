A variable amoun=\r\nt of time may pass before rebirth.\n \nSome people are so attached to the old=\r\n body and old desires. Someone whose self-consciousness simply cannot accep=\r\nt that the body is gone and is still attached to body and its mind may rema=\r\nin as a pitri that needs to be freed from the blocking desires to be reborn=\r\n. They may be stuck for a long time before being reborn.\n \nSome people are =\r\nattached to the desires, but they realize that they need a new body and acc=\r\nept the loss of old body.  They will be reborn to pursue to desires. Howeve=\r\nr, one needs to find the right place and right people (father, mother etc) =\r\nwith appropriate kaarmik debts, before being reborn. That may take a short =\r\ntime in some cases and a long time in some cases.\n \nSome people with good k=\r\narmas are not attached to the old body or its desires, but they are reborn =\r\nto fulfill the Will of Nature and enact god&#39;s lila. Such beings can afford =\r\nto wait for the right time to be born again in a new body. They may wait fo=\r\nr tens or hundreds or thousands or tens of thousands of years before being =\r\nreborn.\n \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa, a great saint and guru of Swami Vivekana=\r\nnda, said that he would be reborn on earth after about 100 years along with=\r\n everybody else who came with him. Of course, one should not think that he =\r\nwas in pitri loka as a pitri. Pitri loka is for beings with a strong self-i=\r\ndentification with the sensory mind. Ramakrishna and his team probably asce=\r\nnded to one of the higher realm of consciousness after leaving those bodies=\r\n and would be born again when the right opportunity presents itself.\n \nThe =\r\nexact gap before rebirth, in what realm of consciousness one&#39;s self-conscio=\r\nusness resides during the gap and what one&#39;s consciousness does during that=\r\n gap, is a function of one&#39;s own conditioning and karmas.\n \nBest regards,\nN=\r\narasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Y=\r\nourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                =\r\n  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://=\r\nSaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-w=\r\nisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n---=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- dav=\r\nyd@... wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Manish!\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for the lin=\r\nk provided.

I mean, I understand each atman is just a piece of the ultimate, a=\r\nnd that ideally we should be praying for all of mankind. Yet, have the rish=\r\nis or anyone in our legacy ever beseeched the gods on behalf of any individ=\r\nual? And if the individual is &#39;dead&#39; would that really matter as the atman =\r\nis everlasting?\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not quite sure how to phrase what I want to ask. =\r\nMy beloved mother passed away several months ago and I feel that I should d=\r\no something to wish her well in her journey toward the ultimate.
