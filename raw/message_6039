There were devastating earthquakes in Haiti and Chile \nlast year and in Pakistan and China 2-3 years back. There were historic \nfloods that did huge long-term damage to fertile lands in Pakistan. \nVolcano in Iceland caused a lot of damage to world economy that was \nalready bad. It is difficult to find a common factor (like whaling) to \nall these places.\n\nJapanese are inherently hard-working and detached people. As a \ncommunity, there is no other community in the world that is a better \nexample of &quot;nishkama karma yoga&quot; than Japanese and Korean people. \nHowever, Japanese may have done their share of bad karmas during the \nlast few centuries or so. It is tough to say which event is caused by \ntheir atrocities against other Asian countries (e.g. China) during World \nWar II and which event is caused by something else. Why even try?\n\n*        *        *\n\nI am afraid huge natural disasters may continue to bother the \ninhabitants of earth in the next several years, until the geo-political \nequilibrium and the lifestyle of human beings change in such a way that \nwe earthlings stop moving in the disastrous direction we have been \nheading in for a few decades now. These changes will be bad for some, \nbut ok for some and good for some others.\n\nEconomists talked about the stock market bubble, real estate bubble etc \nduring 1990s and 2000s. But the real bubble behind all of them is what I \ncall the &quot;consumption bubble&quot;, i.e. the culture of relying on \never-increasing consumption of goods. We rely on people buying new \nphones, new cell phones, new TVs, new computers etc every few years, \nwhether they need or not. We increase their reliance on them and count \non an ever-increasing consumption so that companies do well, people get \nmore money and they can consume more. This bubble is unsustainable and \ndisastrous for Mother Earth. This bubble has been slowly trying to burst \nfor a few years now. This will completely burst and a new sustainable \nlifestyle/philosophy will replace our current mindset.\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhat is happening now and will happen in near future has been triggered \nirreversibly by our own past actions. But some future events are still \nin our hands. If, though our spiritual sadhana and through our actions \nin the material world, we increase dharma and responsible/unselfish \nbehavior in the world, it will impact future events.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vemparlaramkishore&quot; \n&lt;vemparlaramkishore@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt;\n&gt; I just wanted to share some random thoughts to get the opinion of the \n&gt; members.The intent is not to dehumanize the suffering or justify it , \n&gt; just was wondering on the reason. I was thinking about the recent \n&gt; earthquake and the tsunami which followed and did the most damage in \n&gt; Japan. The ways of karma are mysterious and like Vimalananda says in \n&gt; the aghora series &quot; Karma gahano gatih &quot; .\n&gt;  2011-2012 transition is bringing its own share of natural disasters.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.Floods in pakistan last year which took a huge toll.\n&gt; ( Could be due to the huge violence this region has inflicted on the \n&gt; world continously in the past few decades )\n&gt; 2.Floods in Australia in Jan/Feb which also took a huge toll\n&gt;\n&gt; and now the Earthquake/Tsunami in Japan.  Why should nature react in \n&gt; these places.\n&gt;\n&gt; Japan it turns out is the biggest killer of whales every year. Japan \n&gt; continues to hunt wild whales in numbers exceeding 2000 every year \n&gt; under the guise of scientific hunting.No other modern country does \n&gt; this.The ICW often criticizes the japanese for doing this .\n&gt; http://www.wwf.org.au/ourwork/oceans/whales/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Surely this act of killing so many of Maa&#39;s children in the water \n&gt; maybe brought about her wrath through the water .\n&gt;\n&gt; I have heard many modern day guru&#39;s talk about 2011-2012 being a \n&gt; lesson to humanity to learn to respect life in all forms and stop \n&gt; polluting mother earth and the constant killing . It is not earth that \n&gt; is in danger,it is man for nature can easily swat us like a mosquito \n&gt; with a giant tsunami or earthquake.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The directive of the mother goddess to Manish ji and Narasimha ji and \n&gt; the noble intent to heal the etheric atmosphere of the earth through \n&gt; many people taking up homa is commendable in letting people correct \n&gt; their course before nature decides to take drastic action.\n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Vemparla Ram Kishore\n\n"}}
