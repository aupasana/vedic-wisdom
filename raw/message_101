Mr.\nRaja=\r\nn Zed, a journalist and Hindu priest, delivered a minute and a\nhalf prayer =\r\nin which he offered God thanks and prayed for peace.\n\nHowever, before Mr. Z=\r\ned could offer his short prayer to God, three\nChristian activists disrupted=\r\n the ceremony with angry shouts and\ndenunciations of Hinduism to the shock =\r\nof on-lookers. &quot;This is an\nabomination!&quot; the Washington Post reports one of=\r\n the disruptors as\nscreaming. &quot;We are Christians and patriots!&quot; yelled anot=\r\nher before\nbeing led away by police.\n\nShockingly, far from being an isolate=\r\nd and spontaneous incident of\nhatred, it is reported that a large number of=\r\n well-organized\nfundamentalist Christian groups throughout the nation had b=\r\neen\nclamoring against allowing a Hindu priest to lead a prayer in our\nnatio=\r\nn&#39;s capital. The American Family Association has been on the\nforefront of u=\r\nrging Christians to take direct action against\nreligious tolerance and aske=\r\nd their followers to contact the Senate\nto ban a Hindu from leading prayer.=\r\n\n\nFor further information on this dark and disturbing incident, please\nrevi=\r\new the following sites:\n\nUSA Today:\nhttp://blogs.usatoday.com/ondeadline/20=\r\n07/07/christian-prote.html\n\nYouTube:\nhttp://youtube.com/watch?v=3Dg8vENZwp1=\r\nrk\n\nAmerica has been celebrated throughout the world as a society that\ncher=\r\nishes religious tolerance, freedom of faith, and respect for\ndifferent cult=\r\nures. Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma) is the most ancient\ncontinuously practiced=\r\n spiritual tradition on earth. Hinduism is a\ndignified and highly respected=\r\n religion that has always fostered\npeace, respect of cultural diversity, an=\r\nd freedom of thought.\n\nAs an American Hindu leader, and the President of th=\r\ne International\nSanatana Dharma Society, I would urge all freedom loving Am=\r\nericans to\nopenly reject such disturbing instances of hatred, bigotry, and\n=\r\nprejudice as we sadly witnessed at this event.\n\nI also urge all Hindus to b=\r\necome actively involved in vocally\ndenouncing this incident of bigotry, and=\r\n insisting that mainstream\nAmerican society extend the same respect and tol=\r\nerance toward\nHinduism as it commonly gives to the Abrahamic minority relig=\r\nions in\nour great nation. Together, let us create a nation of mutual\nrespec=\r\nt, and tolerance of diverse cultures and religions.\n\nOm Shanti (May Peace P=\r\nrevail),\n\nDr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.\n(Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya)\n\nPreside=\r\nnt =96 Spiritual Director\nInternational Sanatana Dharma Society\n\nhttp://www=\r\n.dharmacentral.com\ninfo@...\n(608) 280-8375\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
