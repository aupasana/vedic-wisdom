While doing Chandi =\r\nhomam, do I need add svaaha to all &quot;uvAcha&quot; and &quot;Uchu&quot; too, I see the manua=\r\nl says any thing that ends with number should have &quot;svAha&quot; followed by offe=\r\nrings.\n2. Also, the last verse in each chapter ends with &quot;Om&quot; or &quot;klIm&quot;, do=\r\n I need to add svAha after that or before that when the verse finishes? I e=\r\nnd with svAha when the verse finishes, followed by &quot;Om SvAha&quot; or &quot;klIm svAh=\r\na&quot;. Hope that is fine.\n3. Do I need to clean the havan kund every time I do=\r\n Chandi homam ? I do SriKrsna homam daily and am planning to do Chandi homa=\r\nm weekly or whenever possible ? I clean my havan kund (wash) once a week or=\r\n 10 days, else I clean the old havan burnings once in 3-4 days.\n4. After Sr=\r\niKrsna homam daily, I eat whatever is ready to eat as breakfast. It can be =\r\nleftovers from the previous night too. After Chandi homam, can I do the sam=\r\ne? Meaning can I have freshly cooked and any leftovers from the night or is=\r\n that an offense ? Similarly, can I just eat some prasAdam and go out to ea=\r\nt. I don&#39;t normally eat out, even if I, it is in an Iskcon restaurant or so=\r\nme near by place where the food is cooked with onion / garlic; but still as=\r\nking to know the rules.\n5. I offer Sweet pongal for Chandi homam. Normally =\r\nI eat little prasAdam once the hOmam is done. Is it fine that I have my mea=\r\nl on the dining table or do we need to have the immediate next meal with pr=\r\nasAdam on the floor like the traditional brahminical style ?\n6. Can I put t=\r\nhe raksha on my kids foreheads if they did not take bath by the time hOmam =\r\nis finished ?\n\nSome of the questions may sound funny, still I wanted to kno=\r\nw if there are any strict adherences.\n\nBtw, I have done my second Chandi ho=\r\nmam today; technically first in a copper havan kund :-)\n\nregards\nrAma\n\n\n"}}
