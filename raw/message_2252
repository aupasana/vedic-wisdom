It can not be stopped for whatever reason. e.g. in my uncle&#39;s (mother&#39;s b=\r\nrother) family ganesh chaturthi vrat is there. My uncle passed away las yea=\r\nr. My mami and my sister are not in favor of continuing this vrat.\n\nI want =\r\nto know what does shastra says on this.\n\nregards,\n\nJagmohan\n\n\n"}}
