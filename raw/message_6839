Make every effort to attend classes in person. It will be much more \n&gt; effective than anything you can do by yourself.\n&gt;\n&gt; There are several options for self-study:\n&gt; (a) The first level of Samskrita Bharati classes is available as a DVD \n&gt; set. These classes are suppossed to be interactive. Pretend that the \n&gt; DVD instructors are in front of you, and talk to the televsion. Really.\n&gt; (b) Samskita Bharati (and many other organizations) have \n&gt; correspondence courses available.\n&gt; (c) Rashtriya Samskrita Samsthan has published a good &quot;Teach Yourself \n&gt; Sanskrit&quot; series (diikShA book series).\n&gt;\n&gt; Make every effort to speak in sanskrit. If you and your friends (or \n&gt; family) can&#39;t attend classes, then try to speak in sanskrit to each \n&gt; other when you meet. It will accelerate your sanskrit learning \n&gt; significantly.\n&gt;\n&gt; sasneham,\n&gt;    ajit\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sun, Jul 10, 2011 at 10:49 AM, ShreeramShishya \n&gt; &lt;shreeramshishya@... &lt;mailto:shreeramshishya@...&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;     Namaste Shris,\n&gt;\n&gt;     Thanks for the pointers, i do have a very close friend in\n&gt;     SanskritBharathi who are very active.\n&gt;\n&gt;     But pardon my insistence, is there some sort of book that i can\n&gt;     take as a self study guide so to speak and progress from there?\n&gt;     Maybe SanskritBharathi&#39;s course material is the answer maybe not.\n&gt;     The only thing is i doubt i can attend the classes regularly\n&gt;     especially if they are in person.\n&gt;\n&gt;     Thanks again,\n&gt;\n&gt;     Chaitanya\n&gt;\n&gt;     On 7/10/11 10:43 AM, Ajit Krishnan wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     Dear Chaitanya,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     You first learn basic arithmetic ... then you reach a point where you\n&gt;&gt;     are fit to study algebra, calculus or geometry. Similarly, you first\n&gt;&gt;     need to pick up basic Sanskrit skills, then you can put them to\n&gt;&gt;     use in\n&gt;&gt;     the manner of your choosing. Narasimha once wrote &quot;Whether the final\n&gt;&gt;     destination is Delhi or Agra or Benares, one at Kanya Kumari will\n&gt;&gt;     have\n&gt;&gt;     to first start walking towards north&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     In my opinion, start with one of the organizations that teaches\n&gt;&gt;     conversational sanskrit (eg. Samskrita Bharati). They take a nice\n&gt;&gt;     staged approach ... most importantly, they have made it fun. I\n&gt;&gt;     personally know many people who studied using this method ...\n&gt;&gt;     with the\n&gt;&gt;     aid of readily available sanskrit commentaries, they are easily\n&gt;&gt;     able to read\n&gt;&gt;     gita, kalidasa and even some veda mantras. Many of these students are\n&gt;&gt;     now studying for their MA Sanskrit degree.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     Basic sanskrit skills are relatively easy ... you can make\n&gt;&gt;     significant\n&gt;&gt;     progress in the beginning with minimal effort. If you are in the\n&gt;&gt;     US or\n&gt;&gt;     India, definitely attend one of Samskrita Bharati&#39;s residential camps\n&gt;&gt;     (they have classes at all levels, including classes for beginners).\n&gt;&gt;     You&#39;ll get to meet many people who are the product of this system.\n&gt;&gt;     You&#39;ll believe it when you hear it and start speaking it :-)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     [ If you are in the US, there are three more Samskrita Bharati\n&gt;&gt;     residential camps taking place in 2011. (i) Seattle at the end of\n&gt;&gt;     July, (ii) Michigan at the beginning of August and (iii) New\n&gt;&gt;     Jersey in\n&gt;&gt;     the beginning of September.

If you\n                      and your friends (or family) can&#39;t attend classes,\n                      then try to speak in sanskrit to each other when\n                      you meet. It will accelerate your sanskrit\n                      learning significantly.&lt;/div&gt;\n                    &lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                    &lt;div&gt;sasneham,&lt;/div&gt;\n                    &lt;div&gt;\n                      &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n                      &lt;div&gt;   ajit&lt;/div&gt;\n                      &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n                      &lt;div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n                      &lt;br&gt;\n                      &lt;br&gt;\n                      &lt;br&gt;\n                      &lt;div class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Sun, Jul 10, 2011 at\n                        10:49 AM, ShreeramShishya &lt;span dir=&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a\n                            moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot; rel=&quot;nofollow&quot;\n                            ymailto=&quot;mailto:shreeramshishya@...&quot;\n                            target=&quot;_blank&quot;\n                            href=&quot;mailto:shreeramshishya@...&quot;&gt;shreeramshishya@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;\n                        wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n                        &lt;blockquote class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;\n                          style=&quot;border-left:1px #ccc solid;&quot;&gt;\n                          &lt;div&gt; Namaste Shris, &lt;br&gt;\n                            &lt;br&gt;\n                            Thanks for the pointers, i do have a very\n                            close friend in SanskritBharathi who are\n                            very active. &lt;br&gt;\n                            &lt;br&gt;\n                            But pardon my insistence, is there some sort\n                            of book that i can take as a self study\n                            guide so to speak and progress from there?\n                            Maybe SanskritBharathi&#39;s course material is\n                            the answer maybe not.
