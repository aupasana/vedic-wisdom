Kapalikas were followers of a par=\r\nticular Saiva sect (the left-hand order) who always carried human skulls, w=\r\nore them as garlands around their necks and even ate and drank from these m=\r\nacabre vessels. Lord Siva himself is hailed as Kapali. The Lord of the famo=\r\nus temple in Mylapore in Chennai is worshipped as Kapaliswara; why is anoth=\r\ner story.\n&gt; This Kapalika had been nursing a grievance against Adi Sankara =\r\nwhom he viewed as a potential threat to his faith and sect. He took the Ach=\r\narya to a nearby cave, made necessary arrangements for the sacrifice-ritual=\r\n and prepared himself to behead Adi Sankara. The Acharya was all along in a=\r\n trance.\n&gt; However, when the Kapalika lifted his sword and readied himself =\r\nto chop off his head Sankara&#39;s disciple Padmapada (also known as Sanandana)=\r\n envisioned this murderous scheme in his mind. He rushed to the cave in a t=\r\nrice. In an &#39;avesa&#39; (possessed with divine powers) of Lord Narasimha he, ve=\r\nrily, became the man-lion Lord himself temporarily. He had attained Narasim=\r\nha mantra siddhi and, becoming frightfully ferocious, caught hold of the vi=\r\nllainous Kapalika and tore him to pieces.\n&gt; Sankara Vijaya, published by th=\r\ne Ramakrishna Math in Chennai, describes how Padmapada leapt into the sky, =\r\nscattering away the clouds with a slash of his mane, and literally flew int=\r\no the cave, stunning all beholders. It was a re-enactment of the Narasimha =\r\nincarnation once again when the demon Hiranyakasipu was disembowelled by th=\r\ne Lord with his leonine claws.\n&gt; Adi Sankara, hearing the thunderous roars =\r\nof a lion, awoke from his trance and witnessed the gory scene. Padmapada&#39;s =\r\nbody was smeared with the blood of the vile Kapalika while his face glowed =\r\nwith divine splendour like a galaxy of suns. The Acharya saw before him the=\r\n awesome Lord Narasimha himself and pacified him with soothing and overflow=\r\ning devotion.\n&gt; On another occasion, Adi Sankara&#39;s hands got burnt (the Ama=\r\nruka episode) but he was cured by extolling Lord Narasimha through the famo=\r\nus hyms, the 17-verse Lakshmi Narasimha Karavalamba Stotram (also known as =\r\nLakshmi Narasimha Karunarasa Stotram&#39;). These hymns are so titled because e=\r\nach of these verses ends with the same refrain &#39;Lakshmi Narasimha, mama deh=\r\ni karavalambam&#39; (O Lord Narasimha, please lend me your helping hand).\n&gt; It =\r\nis believed that fervent recitation of these hymns on Lord Narasimha (one o=\r\nf the two stotras Adi Sankara composed on Him) will always help one smoothl=\r\ny get over difficulties with the Lord&#39;s helping hand.\n&gt; Salagrama, the sacr=\r\ned stone found only in the Kandaki river in Nepal, and worshipped by Vaishn=\r\navites in their homes, is used in the puja of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam. T=\r\nhis is said to be specially sacred to Lord Narasimha and is believed to hav=\r\ne been given to Adi Sankara by Lord Narasimha himself.\n&gt; R Srinivasan &quot;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; *This masterly introduction by Mr.R.Srivasan is taken from www.chennaionl=\r\nine.com\n&gt;
