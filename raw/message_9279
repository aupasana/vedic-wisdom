Dattatreya=\r\n is an avatara of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva together, i.e. creative, sustain=\r\ning and destructive principles of Purusha combined together. That is why he=\r\n is not among Dasavataras. That does not make him any less or more. His pur=\r\npose/functionality is simply different from that of Rama, Krishna, Narasimh=\r\na, or Venkateswara.

Feel free to disagree :)\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;Firstly, I feel, the conception of colloquially used=C2=A0term=C2=A0Bhagaw=\r\nan as a Superman with unlimited potentials way beyond what any normal human=\r\n being can achieve, came into existence from the Vaishnava schools of Kali =\r\nYuga, who looked at Krshna as the ultimate God=C2=A0on earth. It is difficu=\r\nlt to miss the phonetic=C2=A0similarity between terms Bhagawata and Bhagawa=\r\nna. The Bhagawata religion started from the Gita and a contemplation of the=\r\n life of Krshna. All the major purely=C2=A0Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacha=\r\nrya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, Sri Chaitanya=C2=A0as well as =\r\nthe nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earliest known non-sanskrit translation=\r\n of the Gita) - considered, (with differing nuances on the=C2=A0relation be=\r\ntween jiva, paramatma, moksha=C2=A0etc), Krshna as the ultimate conception =\r\nof God on earth. This was aided in no less a measure by the delcaration of =\r\nthe earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Purana and the SB, that Krshna was a c=\r\nomplete Avatara. Some,\n like the Gaudiya Vaishnavas, went one step ahead an=\r\nd took a very literal view of it all and declared Krshna as the Ultimate Be=\r\ning, and the formless Paramatma, as well as Narayana,=C2=A0as merely=C2=A0t=\r\nhe aura of Krshna. Rama was also intricately linked to this Krshnaa-ism, bu=\r\nt was looked at as the earlier brith of Krshna, not as a separate Divity in=\r\n himself.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Whatever the case maybe, each school had its own set o=\r\nf established saints and scholars to vouch for their views. So it boiled do=\r\nwn to interpretation, which is often, as you rightly pointed out, based on=\r\n=C2=A0various conditionings.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;We=C2=A0human beings are creatures =\r\nof imagination. Whenever an Avatar appears on the earth,=C2=A0most of the g=\r\nreat Mahatmas who appear after the Avatara, remain=C2=A0overawed by the=C2=\r\n=A0character of the last Avatara=C2=A0because invariable in the context of =\r\nthe desh-kaal-patra of those times, the life of the Avatara shows actions p=\r\nerformed which are=C2=A0way beyond=C2=A0imagination for *those times*. Such=\r\n a situation continues until the next Avatara comes on earth. I am sure in =\r\nthe period after Rama, and before Krshna, of which we have very little writ=\r\nten record, the world at large remained entirely overawed by Rama Avatara.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;In this light Krshna is the Poorna-Avatara. When Kalki will appe=\r\nar on earth, he will be invarible accompanied by a set of powerful Rishis -=\r\n every Avatara comes with his coterie of Rishis who explain the philosophy =\r\nand spirituality of the Avatara to the general masses - who will then creat=\r\ne new scriptures and Kalki will be looked at as the crest jewel=C2=A0of the=\r\n Avataras.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;I believe in the e=\r\nvolutionary parable of these 9 Avatara because I find no other reason why t=\r\nhese set of Avatara, from the whole list of possible=C2=A0Avataras, have ca=\r\nptured the popular imagination. I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per =\r\nSB. His spirituality is no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is =\r\nnot in the list of 9/10 Avataras. \n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;The=C2=A0original Nath Yogis =\r\nused to consider=C2=A0Nine Chakras in the Human Body. The idea of Kundalini=\r\n Yoga also came from them, which was basically exploring=C2=A0cronologicall=\r\ny all these nine chakras one after the other by flooding them with Chit-Sha=\r\nkti.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;There are 9 basic grahas in jyotish. Each graha could very =\r\nwell=C2=A0represent the essential nature of each chakra. All these make me =\r\nmore sanguine that there must be Nine Evolutionary Avataras, not ten. In wh=\r\nich case Kalki must be the Ninth Avatara.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Buddha, as you rightly=\r\n pointed out,=C2=A0has a tremendous logical appeal in Kali Yuga. But if log=\r\nic is the criteria, then why not Adi Shankara? I may not agree to=C2=A0his =\r\nphilosophy as it comes down to us from his followers, but it cannot be deni=\r\ned that=C2=A0Adi Shankara was=C2=A0arguable one of the sharpest and most lo=\r\ngical of spiritual philosphers. His intellectual and logical mind=C2=A0is b=\r\neyond doubt.=C2=A0Just that Shankara=C2=A0never claimed himself to be an Av=\r\natara. Neither did=C2=A0Siddhartha. Only that the later came 3000 years ago=\r\n, and the former came possibly in the last 1000 years.=C2=A0Shankara&#39;s spir=\r\nitual impact on the world is no less than that of the=C2=A0Buddha. What mai=\r\nnstream=C2=A0Hinduism today is, could not have been, had it not been for th=\r\ne invaluable contribution of Adi Shankara. And if Buddha was truly=C2=A0the=\r\n awaited=C2=A09th Avatara of Vishnu, Shankara would not have been able to a=\r\nbsorb the philosophy of Buddha into Hinduism and thus make it lose its grip=\r\n on India. Buddhism\n barely exists in land of its birth.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;All thi=\r\ns taken together, make me more and more convinced that there are 9 evolutio=\r\nnary Avataras and the 9th is yet to come.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;A little bit about Rama and Krshna. When I said I admire Rama, it =\r\nis not a lip-service. There are incidents in the Ramayana which I find extr=\r\nemely inspiring, educative and uplifting. Like the incident where Rama was =\r\nto cross the ocean. Rama knew very well that if he wanted, in one moment he=\r\n could have used his Divine Astras and forced the ocean to yield way to his=\r\n army. Yet he sat in silent supplication for days, praying that the ocean a=\r\nllow his army safe passage. When all else failed, when genuine goodwill was=\r\n not recirpocated, and it was absolutely necessary to cross the ocean,=C2=\r\n=A0THEN=C2=A0Rama took up weapons to get the job done.=C2=A0A powerful warr=\r\nior,=C2=A0who knows=C2=A0very well how=C2=A0powerful he=C2=A0himself is, no=\r\nt letting that sense of power pervert his mind even for a moment is an amaz=\r\ning phenomenon. This kind of self-control is rare and worthy of comtemplati=\r\non, specially by anyone who feels, ever so slightly, that he/she has some f=\r\norm of power or influence in\n this world in any sphere.=C2=A0Rama had no ma=\r\nlice for anyone. Not even Ravana, by the end of the war at least. He was th=\r\ne very personification of Satwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice and cunningn=\r\ness are impossible.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Recently, a friend of mine told me that he h=\r\nas learnt all his life that one must listen to Krshna&#39;s advice, but only fo=\r\nllow what Rama did, and not what Krshna did. I disagree with this vehementl=\r\ny. If one reads entire Krshna&#39;s life=C2=A0with an objective mind, Krshna of=\r\n Vrndavana, Krshna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Guru =\r\nwho speaks the Gita, one will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced in the=\r\n Gita,=C2=A0Krshna the=C2=A0Divine Worker=C2=A0himself followed it all thro=\r\nugh his life at every instance. It is his=C2=A0perfect detachment under all=\r\n circumstances of life, from childhood=C2=A0to his death,=C2=A0that makes m=\r\ne wonder, was this a man or was this a God? Can a man even do something lik=\r\ne this? It is as if there is a part of Krshna who is always separate from e=\r\nverything, and silently watches the whole scene with a bemused smile. He ha=\r\nd not a single personal stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had his wif=\r\ne abducted for him to start a war against Ravana.\n But Krshna had zero=C2=\r\n=A0personal stake in the Mahabharata.=C2=A0After liberating his parents fro=\r\nm Kamsa, very soon he went off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere he=\r\n forced himself into the politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a gr=\r\neat war to cleanse the world of burden. While Lakshmana devoutly followed R=\r\nama all along the Ramayana and they were like an inseparable pair, as=C2=A0=\r\nBalarama in his next incarnation=C2=A0he could=C2=A0hardly understand Krshn=\r\na. There are so many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they d=\r\noing with all these kings, and=C2=A0that they should=C2=A0return to their v=\r\nillage in Vrndavana. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone will =\r\nunderstand everything. But that cannot stop him from following his dharma, =\r\nwith perfect detachement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false prais=\r\nes, nor wrong accusations by his close people can affect him one bit. And I=\r\n am not even counting the miracles he perfromed as a Divine Child. So I\n wo=\r\nrship Krshna, because I have not yet met or heard of read of=C2=A0a single =\r\nsadhaka or saint or ordinary man or mahatma=C2=A0who has displayed this kin=\r\nd of perfected detachment through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from =\r\nthe world or actively performing a larger dharma.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;I started appr=\r\neciating Swami Vivekanada more after I understood a bit of the Krshna Avata=\r\nra. That was the last known saint who lived a whirlwind life in the middle =\r\nof a circus-stoplight of fame and accusations, on one side adoring admirers=\r\n and on the other bitter enemies accusing him of=C2=A0being a heretic=C2=A0=\r\nright upto the=C2=A0very end of his brief life,=C2=A0and yet none of that a=\r\nffected him to any great degree. He faced terrific racism in the America, y=\r\net not a single speech of his reflects the slightest trace of bitterness, a=\r\nnger, or negativity. That is such a fantastic achievement, IMHO.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;I agree with you, Narasimha, for most of us it is better to=C2=A0try to=C2=\r\n=A0mould ones life=C2=A0with the same kind of supreme selflessness that Ram=\r\na showed all along.=C2=A0Not just worship Rama=C2=A0but more importantly st=\r\nudy=C2=A0his life and imbibe,=C2=A0to whatever degree possible, the quality=\r\n he represented.=C2=A0Maybe, just maybe, then the Unmanifested Reality - Sh=\r\niva - will fix the mind so firmly on that Reality, that in some future life=\r\n, in some later birth, one will be able to live life like Krshna showed, un=\r\nattached and unaffected by any dirt that the world throws up.

Though some peopl=\r\ne associate him with lagna, that makes no sense to me either. That is incon=\r\nsistent with the overall framework laid by Parasara (i.e. beings born with =\r\ncombinations of paramatmamsas and jivatmamsas from *grahas*).\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Ka=\r\nlki will probably come with paramatmamsas of both Sun and Moon.

If people at the beginning of Satya yuga are established in Self a=\r\nlways and the only issue is that a small attachment may develop now and the=\r\nn, disturbing that state of being established in Self (i.e. stealing of Ved=\r\na!), then the aspect of consciousness that is relevant is &quot;spirit of detach=\r\nment&quot; (Ketu). If invoked, it removes that attachment and takes one back to =\r\nbeing established in Self. So an avatara corresponding to Ketu occurred.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;As collective consciousness became denser, being established in Se=\r\nlf became less natural and more effort was needed. So the &quot;spirit of patien=\r\nce, persistence and\n hard-work&quot; (Saturn) became relevant and an avatara cor=\r\nresponding to Saturn occurred. And so on.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;In the dark ages of Ka=\r\nli yuga, rational minds wouldn&#39;t accept anything that didn&#39;t &quot;make sense&quot;. =\r\nBeing established in Self became an unnatural, ridiculous and incomprehensi=\r\nble notion. So the &quot;spirit of comprehension&quot; (Mercury) became relevant. An =\r\navatara corresponding to Mercury occurred and tried to explain being establ=\r\nished in Self as a comprehensible notion, so that rational minds of that ag=\r\ne would accept it to an extent and attempt it.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;Avataras occur ba=\r\nsed on the needs of collective consciousness. Of course, if one&#39;s conscious=\r\nness is in a different state from the collective consciousness of that time=\r\n, the current avatara may not be relevant to one.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt; I respect Rama, but I worship Krshna.\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;I am\n awest=\r\nruck by Krishna and worship him, but I see Rama as an ideal that I MAY be a=\r\nble to emulate oneday.

It lists 22 Avataras! It=C2=A0deals with =\r\nthe idea of Avataran, but not with the idea of 9/10 fixed Avataras.=C2=A0It=\r\n also=C2=A0lists Varaha Avatara as the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya as the 10 in=\r\n its list of 22. It is only in other puranas, that we get the focus on 10 A=\r\nvatars, and the term becomes popular. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;And ONLY when we take t=\r\nhese 9/10 Avataras, in a fixed sequence=C2=A0of appearence, that we get the=\r\n popular concept of Dasavatara.

Infact, in the 10th Chapt=\r\ner of Gita when the Supreme explains the various vibhutis, this One is not =\r\neven Krshna, but has transcended every limitation of conception. Hence, the=\r\n One says, among those who weild weapons, it is Rama, and among the Vrishni=\r\ns it is Krshna! Etc..\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;First, he IS mentioned in SB list of a=\r\nvataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of=\r\n evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras ar=\r\ne perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;As I said, the SB li=\r\nst contains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on the idea of 9/10 Avataras! Th=\r\nat is my point. If you take 22 Avataras, then these link to grahas are not =\r\nof any use. For these nine grahas, individually or in combination, will rep=\r\nresent all Avataras, or for that matter everything else in this Universe.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, if we take 10 Avatars and corresponding grahas for ea=\r\nch, then what must Kalki be? Lagna? But=C2=A0lagna is not a graha.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Or, just surmising, can it be possible that until an Avatara actuall=\r\ny descends on the earth, his energy and his force cannot be attributed to a=\r\nny graha, but once he does appear, it reconfigures things completely? We ca=\r\nn only know after the last Avatara comes.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, I am not loo=\r\nking at this main Avatars from the point of grahas/jyotish at all. For that=\r\n matter, some traditions consider Balarama to be an Avatara rather than Bud=\r\ndha.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The concept of Avatara and Vibhutis comes from =\r\nthe Gita. These two are slightly different. Avatara is a special descent of=\r\n God, Paramatma, which appears on this world=C2=A0during times of severe cr=\r\nisis to=C2=A0cause a drastic and fundamental=C2=A0transition. A Vibhuti is =\r\na limited force of God which can appear to help out, directly or indirectly=\r\n, in any transition. A Vibuti need not be spiritual.

In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly men=\r\ntioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poornavataras&quot; (used t=\r\nhat exact expression) while other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa t=\r\noo (though paramatmamsa dominates\n jivatmamsa).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, afte=\r\nr describing the avataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable avata=\r\nras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme=\r\n Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say &quot;these ava=\r\ntaras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I question if the deduct=\r\nion that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It on=\r\nly seems to say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As =\r\nI said above, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poor=\r\nnavataras.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Third, let us ask a very fundamental question: What=\r\n exactly does it mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;While SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3=\r\n.28, it also says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is in reality form=\r\nless (arUpa) and of the\n nature of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manu=\r\nfactured by the qualities of Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it further compares =\r\nforms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clou=\r\nds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. =\r\nSo, again, what is the meaning of a specific form that descended on earth b=\r\neing &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I am afraid people may be misinterpreting this notion =\r\nbased on their fancies and conditioning..\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;All beings are made =\r\nup of paramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being=\r\n). The latter portion is dominant in us and is responsible for desires and =\r\nrebirth. Great avataras descend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very ra=\r\nrely avataras descend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. =\r\nRama and Krishna are specific examples given by Parasara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;They=\r\n are entirely divine, but they do not encapsulate the entire divinity!!!! A=\r\nfter all, &quot;entire\n divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no =\r\ncloud can contain the entire sky. They take part in the drama obeying and e=\r\nxecuting the divine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Krishna as we=\r\nll as Rama.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Buddha was great s=\r\npiritual force in this world. But I do not\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see him fit in the scheme o=\r\nf evolutionary Avatars. His\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; realization, the one he advocated, is a st=\r\natic realization,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an end in a void.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;First, he IS mentione=\r\nd in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; i=\r\nn your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wron=\r\ng and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;Secondly, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies =\r\nlogical mind and the spirit of investigation and comprehension. Logical min=\r\nd\n and its spirit of comprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfecte=\r\nd spirit of comprehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality c=\r\nompletely, for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the =\r\nIncomprehensible in an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up =\r\ndoing. However, logical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in thi=\r\ns Kali yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in thi=\r\ns world in this age.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;If you dismi=\r\nss Parasara&#39;s linking of planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are =\r\nyou absolutely sure that the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect?

The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - sp=\r\nirit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit of patience & persistence, Venus - s=\r\npirit of happiness etc) and the story of corresponding avatara DOES have a =\r\nhighly meaningful connection, esoterically speaking. After all, esotericall=\r\ny is how you really need to understand any higher scriptures and notions in=\r\n them.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;If we take scriptures literally instead and draw lopsid=\r\ned conclusions, some would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and oth=\r\ner deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; =\r\none and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;On a different note, someone may think that Kali, being Aady=\r\naa, is superior\n to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis have d=\r\neclared them to be essentially the same and some scriptures even prohibited=\r\n differentiating between them. As I see it, the difference between them is =\r\ntoo subtle for even rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing some signif=\r\nicant difference between them are, I am afraid, merely projecting their own=\r\n conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were=C2=A0 perfec=\r\ntly detached and fully divine karma yogis.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;If we think about i=\r\nt, perfected mind (paramatma aspect represented by Moon) and soul (paramatm=\r\na aspect represented by Sun) are not really that different. So I am afraid =\r\nKrishna and Rama are not that different, though the specifics of their stor=\r\nies may be different.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;One last word though. If someone truly b=\r\nelieves that Krishna is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice vers=\r\na!), I am very happy for such a person. My arguments are more for the sake =\r\nof sharing thinking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of understanding i=\r\nn the long run, than changing the minds of anyone in the short run. In the =\r\nend, everyone of us will have to go through one&#39;s own cycles of various tam=\r\nasik, rajasik and saattwik stages of evolution before one starts grasping s=\r\nome fistfuls of Reality.

Let=\r\n me write down as I see it, in point by point manner.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. In t=\r\nhe Bhagwata Purana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list=\r\n of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. =\r\nDattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the=\r\n Bhagawata Purana goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumera=\r\nble. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable other=\r\ns, are amsas of the Supreme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Of these various possible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe=\r\n, are/have been accorded special mention and significance across various Hi=\r\nndu spiritual literature, specially those which were composed in the Kali-Y=\r\nuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his ph=\r\nysical presence had curtailed the full effect of Kali,once he left his body=\r\n, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas were composed after this, hence th=\r\nese are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;3. These=\r\n 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, =\r\nNarasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is =\r\nan unmistakeable connection of the form and sequence of these main avatars =\r\nwith the evolution of life on earth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to=\r\n the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first huma=\r\nn life form who immediately takes possession of this earth represented by V=\r\namana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama moving around with=\r\n an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krsh=\r\nna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not to be separated into anot=\r\nher world, but is a progressive realization of the various manifestation an=\r\nd potentials that lie inherent in the consciousness and its development thr=\r\nough various life-forms. Larger spirituality of earth and evolution go hand=\r\n in hand. That is Nature&#39;s grand design for life on\n earth.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;4=\r\n. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on the parable of these main =\r\n9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one worships say Matysa Avata=\r\nra, one will not attain to a state of liberation of the soul. As is the nat=\r\nure of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a person to any=\r\n depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-reali=\r\nzed in their own way and can be consider super-massive spiritual dynamos.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most ad=\r\nored because they represent a stage of evolution, both inside as well as ou=\r\ntside, which society can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represent=\r\ns, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of it=\r\nself. It known how to transform the animal tendencies within and without - =\r\nmonkeys - into a constructive force for a greater purpose. However, as with=\r\n a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of d=\r\nejection. For it is static in nature and will change only when circumstance=\r\ns force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while se=\r\narching for Sita in the forest. He did have a moments fear before the final=\r\n assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed =\r\nthe stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Rama tells S=\r\nita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue he=\r\nr, but it\n was the Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That t=\r\noo was the dharma of that age when he lived, family honor. The way I look a=\r\nt this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for rep=\r\nresenting the things as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, a=\r\nnd not adding his own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribul=\r\nation that Rama faced which culminated into his killing Ravana, he changed =\r\ninto the most dispassionate leader, such that no personal consideration or =\r\nemotions or passions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of w=\r\nhat a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment rig=\r\nht from birth. I am not taking his=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account. I=\r\nt is his singular and constant detachment from situations, from people, fro=\r\nm environment, from circumstances that mark his life. At the age of eight, =\r\nhe decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster par=\r\nents,\n his village-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would m=\r\nake no sense for him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy, s=\r\nettled village life and head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krshn=\r\na tried to reason with them, then he understood that they won&#39;t understand,=\r\n he promised he will return back once his work in Mathura is over. He never=\r\n returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to part=\r\nicipate in their dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them started get=\r\nting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from the =\r\nscene, saying that he belongs to everyone equally and no one has any specia=\r\nl right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept drop=\r\nping flowers on the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abuse=\r\n was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala&#39;s head and was back into his poise=\r\n. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist\n an=\r\nd charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of=\r\n Krshna as another black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his =\r\nvikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies =\r\noff. The very next moment he was back into his own poised self. Never in th=\r\ne whole Mahabharata is there one instance of his going overboard, never a s=\r\ningle shade of depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his actio=\r\nns, irrespective of what others say or think of him. And then right in the =\r\nmiddle of the greatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most=\r\n sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his life remains the best ideal =\r\nof Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. I=\r\nt is impossible. Neither the action nor the results belong to the instrumen=\r\nt. When running away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or wh=\r\nen advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema\n to hit Du=\r\nryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as i=\r\nf by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be lined u=\r\np which would cause the destruction of these people. This kind of knowledge=\r\n cannot come by the rational thinking. But happens when one is constantly a=\r\nnd consciously connected to the Universal Force. We do not find these kind =\r\nof complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana=\r\n. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts =\r\nand retelling, we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have =\r\na 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita tur=\r\nns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships =\r\nher. But if we take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture that=\r\n emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore h=\r\ne displays all the great characteristics of satwa, chief\n of which is self-=\r\ncontrol, as well as the occasional sadness caused due to separation from hi=\r\ns wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly=\r\n. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can also cause some grief when the s=\r\ntability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything i=\r\nn this world - man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he w=\r\nas never affected any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him =\r\neven in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha was great spiritual force in =\r\nthis world. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars.=\r\n His realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization, an end in =\r\na void. This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find this n=\r\not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them negated t=\r\nhis world. If negation of this world and life is the final aim, then why se=\r\nnd so many avatars at crucial stages of\n evolutionary development? If the s=\r\npiritual impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then w=\r\nhy not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But=\r\n do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Naray=\r\nana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava tradition=\r\ns in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, =\r\nto be complete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of li=\r\nfe as well as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed their own kind=\r\n of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an o=\r\nbject of reverence and realization. 7. The original literature of the Nath =\r\nYogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological functio=\r\nns. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most peop=\r\nle, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding B=\r\nuddha - correspond to the full\n power and force of one of these 9 Chakras. =\r\nSimilarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or allow th=\r\ne consciousness to explore and express itself is various possiblities, are =\r\n9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore the =\r\nchief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in number. An=\r\nd the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8. I cannot comment on which gr=\r\naha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says, =\r\nhowever, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one cannot rul=\r\ne out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual misrepresenta=\r\ntion in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not yet app=\r\neared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora books=\r\n, Nishkalanka - the stainless one. There is only one thing which is perfect=\r\nly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in t=\r\nhe full and complete\n purity and might and force and strength of the Atmah.=\r\n By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away opposing f=\r\norces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna used =\r\ndiplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I=\r\n am speculating, won&#39;t even need that. The white horse and that sword is a =\r\nmetaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify the various err=\r\nors and corruptions that beset our age. Well, this is how I look at the sto=\r\nry of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I am rea=\r\nsonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth. -Regards =C2=A0R=\r\najarshi\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param =\r\nbhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: Narasimha P=\r\n.V.R.

For example, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are S=\r\nun, Moon and Mars, respectively. =C2=A0 We also know that Sun, Moon, Mars, =\r\nMercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul=\r\n, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, sp=\r\nirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline,\n spirit of innovation/b=\r\nreaking barriers and detachment (respectively). =C2=A0 Correspondingly, eac=\r\nh avatara is an expression of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. E=\r\nach story is an example of how that aspect operates. =C2=A0 Lord Rama&#39;s sto=\r\nry is a perfected example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a p=\r\nerfected example of how mind operates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected e=\r\nxample of how wisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a p=\r\nerfected example of how energy/drive/initiative operates. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 * =C2=A0 Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, =\r\nenergy in us, learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipl=\r\nine/patience in us - all these are different manifestations of the same Sel=\r\nf. However, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has differen=\r\nt qualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them.=\r\n =C2=A0 We MAY focus on one aspect of us first,\n perfect it and then perfec=\r\nt other aspects through it. But, we need balance between all aspects in the=\r\n end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable =\r\nand are in a balance working together in the Cosmos. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n* =C2=A0 One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may like the story =\r\nthat demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by the qualities=\r\n of mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates, and one wh=\r\no is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story that demonstr=\r\nates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter of taste and=\r\n subjective preference. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Let us focus on Rama a=\r\nnd Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a representative of god in =\r\nus, because of some basic attributes of it. It is the higher self and has n=\r\no agendas, no likes or dislikes. =C2=A0 Once mind fancies a separate existe=\r\nnce with some\n agendas/desires, soul supports the individualized consciousn=\r\ness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends strength a=\r\nnd support to EVERY aspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g. mind,=\r\n energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It suppor=\r\nts them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It =\r\nimpassionately witnesses and records all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas so tha=\r\nt Laws of Nature give proper fruits later on. It does all that despite full=\r\n awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. =\r\nAs mind and other aspects of the individualized consciousness entertain the=\r\n notion that they are doing things and begetting the fruits, soul supports =\r\nthem fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma and does it impassionat=\r\nely. =C2=A0 Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functio=\r\nnality of an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not seem interes=\r\nting enough\n to some. =C2=A0 On the other hand, mind has likes, dislikes an=\r\nd agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting things and achi=\r\neving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualization going!!!=\r\n Though soul is the support for everything else in the individualized consc=\r\niousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. It is mind tha=\r\nt keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas and passion and e=\r\nven decides/affects every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, mind is really the &quot;bo=\r\nss&quot; of the individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life appeals more to one =\r\nwho may be excited by this description! =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=A0 Lord K=\r\nrishna is obviously awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in perspectiv=\r\ne. =C2=A0 Rama&#39;s life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he re=\r\nceived Brahma Jnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whateve=\r\nr was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was give=\r\nn\n kingdom. At the last moment, his father banished him to forest at the be=\r\nhest of his step-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had n=\r\no complaints. Though his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty t=\r\no various degrees, he himself supported and consoled all three and followed=\r\n his dharma impassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest with =\r\nLakshmana and going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it i=\r\nmpassionately when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he sear=\r\nched for her and fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him t=\r\no leave her or faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every l=\r\nife situation with no complaints and did the best possible action then. Eve=\r\nn as he killed Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impass=\r\nionate dharma. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully le=\r\narned some subjects that were going to disappear with Ravana! =C2=A0 Rama\n =\r\nis a perfect example of a liberated man with no desires or agendas who impa=\r\nssionately discharges one&#39;s dharma arising from the momentum of karmas befo=\r\nre liberation. THAT is basically what soul does! =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * =C2=\r\n=A0 As another example, let us look at Lord Vaamana. His story is a perfect=\r\n demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates. =C2=A0 He was born as=\r\n a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable =\r\ndemon king with many great qualities. =C2=A0 Wisdom/discrimination makes on=\r\ne humble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tainted with demon=\r\nic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not please=\r\nd until that pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousn=\r\ness, then demonic qualities are completely suppressed. =C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n* =C2=A0 Please think about the other avataras. The stories can be understo=\r\nod as perfect demonstrations of how various aspects of\n our consciousness o=\r\nperate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara. =C2=A0 Let us not compare Da=\r\nsavataras, but celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if you are mor=\r\ne attracted to one of them, please think about that avatara more and develo=\r\np devotion.

If one does not try to understand the nature, essence and purpose of each=\r\n avatara and looks at superficial things like the physical body they came i=\r\nn, and tries to fit them in some pattern, one will only draw superficial co=\r\nnclusions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13=\r\n.3333px; font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; background-color: transpa=\r\nrent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0)=\r\n;font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-=\r\ncolor:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;-------=\r\n-&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;=\r\n_blank&quot;\n href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:=\r\narial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style=\r\n:normal;&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2p=\r\nx solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; margin-top: 5px; padding-left: =\r\n5px;&quot;&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size:=\r\n 10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new york, times, serif=\r\n; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial=\r\n&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; rajarsh=\r\ni nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: b=\r\nold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; T=\r\nuesday, May 7, 2013 10:16 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subj=\r\nect:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re:\n [vedic-wisdom] Re: Comparing Dasavataras!&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; =\r\n&lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=3D&quot;y_msg_container&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv9978807906&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;=\r\nyiv9978807906ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000;backg=\r\nround-color:#fff;font-family:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-=\r\nserif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt;Dear Narasimha,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jai Ma!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;If cap=\r\nturing the popular imagination is the criterion,&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You misunde=\r\nrstood what I was saying.

There are so many =\r\npaths, deities, practices, philosophies because there are so many varied ki=\r\nnds of individuals. No one format will work for all.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, I simp=\r\nly cannot find, any other reason or justification for that matter as to why=\r\n the Dasavatara-concept has become popular, unless we consider the evolutio=\r\nnary\n angle.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv9978=\r\n807906MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv9978807906Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv9978807906Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;=\r\ncolor:rgb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv99788079=\r\n06yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new yo=\r\nrk, times, serif;&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv9978807906yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yiv9978807906y=\r\nui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yiv9978807906yui_3_7_2_27_1367930608049_73&quot; styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000=\r\n&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanutta=\r\nmam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace,\n san=\r\ns-serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new yo=\r\nrk, times, serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;fon=\r\nt face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha P.V.R.

Why are the *4th=\r\n*, 7th and 8th avataras most popular if there is a nice &quot;evolutionary&quot; sequ=\r\nence among the 9???&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;There is a very simple explanation, if one=\r\n throws away the notion of &quot;evolutionary&quot; sequence. These are *poornavatara=\r\ns*, completely divine and devoid of jeevatmamsa, as per Parasara. In contra=\r\nst, the 5th and 6th\n avataras did have some jeevatmamsa in them.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;&lt;I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too =\r\nas per SB. His spirituality is no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet,=\r\n he is not in the list of 9/10 Avataras.&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;First of all,=\r\n dasavataras are not a &quot;top 10&quot; short-list of SB&#39;s list. SB list gives the =\r\navataras of Supreme Being (&quot;Purusha&quot; as it calls). Dasavataras OTOH are spe=\r\ncifically of Vishnu, who is the &quot;sustaining principle&quot; of Purusha. Dattatre=\r\nya is an avatara of Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva together, i.e. creative, susta=\r\nining and destructive principles of Purusha combined together. That is why =\r\nhe is not among Dasavataras. That does not make him any less or more. His p=\r\nurpose/functionality is simply different from that of Rama, Krishna, Narasi=\r\nmha, or Venkateswara. Just in terms of &quot;popularity&quot;, he is actually more po=\r\npular than\n some of the dasavataras.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, rather than *co=\r\nmparing* avataras in terms like &quot;less&quot; or more in &quot;spirituality&quot;, try to *u=\r\nnderstand* avataras from the point of view of what functionality and role t=\r\nhey play in the functioning of collective cosmic consciousness. THAT is the=\r\n key to understanding them and their place in cosmos. And also to internali=\r\nzing them eventually..&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Whether you=\r\n call the Supreme Being a\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
