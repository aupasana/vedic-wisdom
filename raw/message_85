Posturing seems to come with\n&gt; the territory to some extent.\n\nRishis were very open-minded and had a perfectly integrated knowledge of all \naspects of the Unlimited (Brahman, non-dual Supreme Self) as well the \nLimited (Maya, i.e. manifestation of Brahman as the dual world). They \nunderstood Brahman as well as Maya and had mastery over both domains.\n\nWe are now in Kali Yuga and it is inevitable that biases, narrow-mindedness \nand posturing enter the mindsets of many learned.\n\nAs long as one is living the dual reality, the duality enters all things. \nPolarization is the very nature of duality. Good and bad, beautiful and \nugly, powerful and weak, learned and ignorant - all these seemingly opposite \npolarities are a creation of the duality. Even when it comes to spiritual \nprogress and reaching god, there are polarities. There are seemingly \nopposing paths. One scripture says one thing and another says the opposite. \nOne may take one word of one scripture as the ultimate Truth and another may \ntake another word of another scripture as the ultimate Truth. Unfortunately, \nall the knowledge we get from books, gurus etc is still in the domain of \nduality and not free from the phenomenon of opposites.\n\nThe only solution is to be firmly established in the non-dual Supreme Self \nat all times and see each thing in the dual world for what it truly is, i.e. \nyet another manifestation of the very same non-dual Self.\n\nSuch a state was achieved by so many rishis in the past. In this age, \nhowever, such rishis are so rare. No wonder there is too much posturing and \ndisagreement.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; Your passage on Kaali bhakta was interesting as\n&gt; it points to a different outcome. Divine intoxication\n&gt; versus no experience and no mind. Perhaps both\n&gt; are experienced at some point in the path?\n\nYes, there were (and are) those who experienced both. However, there are \nsome who reject one of the two in favor of the other. Actually, one would be \nmost fortunate to reach either state.\n\nIf you look at the &quot;star in the sky&quot; analogy I gave earlier, you will see \ndifferent goals in Dwaita, Visishtadwaita and Adwaita paths. Some people \nfollowing one approach do not entertain notions corresponding to another \napproach. However, some take them as diferent stops in the same journey.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI just want to make one more comment that is not directly relevant to the \ndiscussion, but touches it on the periphery. May those who find my views and \nanalogies silly kindly ignore me.\n\nHard-core Adwaitis are essentially Vedantis and jnaana (gyaana) yogis. This \npath is appropriate for someone who is already quite evolved. If one is too \ndeeply sunk in the delusion of this dual world appearance, it is a difficult \npath. It is like telling someone who wants to reach the sky, &quot;you are \nalready in the sky. Just realize it and be done&quot;. The poor guy is very much \non earth and can by no means &quot;realize&quot; that he is &quot;already in the sky&quot;.\n\nOne who is rooted on earth and wants to reach the sky needs to engage in \nsome actions that elevate one and prepare one for reaching the sky. Various \ntantras and rituals help in that. These are more appropriate for many people \nthan the path of Adwaita, jnaana yoga and contemplation.\n\nHowever, if one gets too involved in building tall structures on earth, one \nmay find it interesting and keep on building taller and taller structures \nand forget the ultimate goal of finally reaching the sky. Building tall \nstructures will help one rise from earth, but not help one reach the sky. \nHowever tall a building one builds, it will still not take one to the sky. \nReaching the sky is not about building tall buildings. Books and gurus can \nteach one how to build tall structures, but the final leap into the sky is \nuntaught.\n\nIn the analogy I am talking about here, Adwaitic self-realization is akin to \nreaching the sky. Normal state of a person is akin to being on earth. \nBuilding tall structures on earth is akin to engaging in various tantras, \nrituals and practices to progress spiritually.\n\nBy engaging in more and more practices, one may experience more and more \nthings and get some siddhis etc. This is akin to building tall structures \nand climbing them. Even as one builds tall structures, the final goal of \nreaching the sky should be at the back of one&#39;s mind. Otherwise, one can get \nlost in the practices and not reach the final goal.\n\nThere is no fool-proof approach to have an Adwaitic self-realization. Even \nas one engages in various practices, one should keep the final goal at the \nback of mind. That is why I recommend reading Vedanta works like &quot;Yoga \nVaasishtham&quot; and various Upanishats and keeping the high philosophy at the \nback of mind even while engaging in various practices.\n\nEnough for today..\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;shrivajra&quot; &lt;shrivajra@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, July 03, 2007 11:39 AM\nSubject: [sivacharya] Re: On Adwaitism, Shiva&#39;s Worship and Different Paths\n\n\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt; The &#39;return to Shiva&#39; page that I found has\n&gt; already helped me to contextualise some\n&gt; powerful experiences I have had in meditation\n&gt; and it wonderfully complements some very\n&gt; advanced interpretations of the Pali teachings\n&gt; I have recently read.

Qucik replies for now..\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the &quot;Return to Shiva&quot; link sent by you is from Yoga Vaasishtham. It\n&gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; not what I was referring to, but it is beautiful as well. Yoga\n&gt;&gt; Vaasishtham\n&gt;&gt; is full of beautiful passages.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, the third one on the search link sent by you is the commentary I was\n&gt;&gt; referring to.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You can find a lot of material on Adi Shankara. He was a prolific teacher\n&gt;&gt; who taught Adwaita. Many scholars at that time did not like Buddha. At a\n&gt;&gt; time when Vedic scholars forgot the essence of Veda and hung on to words\n&gt;&gt; without an understanding of their true meaning, Buddha taught the essence\n&gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; Veda. This was unpalatable to many Hindu scholars and they dismissed him.\n&gt;&gt; When Adi Shankara taught similar things, they criticized Adi Shankara\n&gt;&gt; saying\n&gt;&gt; that he was teaching &quot;concealed Buddhism&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There are verses in &quot;Padma Purana&quot; (6.236.6-11) in which Shiva tells\n&gt;&gt; Parvati\n&gt;&gt; that He will be born in Kali yuga as a Brahmin and teach the science of\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; falsehood of the illusory appearance of this world. He says that he will\n&gt;&gt; explain the misunderstood words of scriptures and teach the formless\n&gt;&gt; nature\n&gt;&gt; of Brahman. There he mentions that the theory taught by him will envelop\n&gt;&gt; Buddhism (&quot;bauddham&quot;).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you read &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;, you will see that what Vasishtha taught\n&gt;&gt; Lord\n&gt;&gt; Rama is not much different from what Buddha taught.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;There is no I-ness or It-ness or experience.

Whether a jnaani reaches it\n&gt;&gt; through contemplation or a Kaali bhakta reaches it through oneness with\n&gt;&gt; Kaali, the state is the same.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; But some Hindu masters like oneness with a form  more than the above\n&gt;&gt; state\n&gt;&gt; of oneness with the Formless Reality. When one&#39;s ego completely melts and\n&gt;&gt; obtains oneness with a deity, mind is very much active and experiences\n&gt;&gt; diverse objects as extensions of that deity. Some masters find this state\n&gt;&gt; (referred to by Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as &quot;divine intoxication&quot;) a more\n&gt;&gt; blissful experience than a state where there is no experience and no mind\n&gt;&gt; (nirvikalpa samadhi).\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; After talking about Nirvikalpa Samadhi and Adwaita, I just wanted to\n&gt;&gt; offer a\n&gt;&gt; different perspective..\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;shrivajra&quot; &lt;shrivajra@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, July 02, 2007 6:16 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [sivacharya] Re: On Adwaitism, Shiva&#39;s Worship and Different\n&gt;&gt; Paths\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Many thanks for a beautiful and sublime reply.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I find nothing &quot;freewheeling&quot; or &quot;foolish&quot; in it.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; It contextualises the remark you made in your\n&gt;&gt; &gt; welcome message and I can see what you mean.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Your tip sent me off on a google search and I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; encountered one of the most wonderful texts I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; have ever read entitled Returning To Shiva.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I wondered if it was taken from the Yoga\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Vaasishtham text you mentioned:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.spiritual-teachers.com/returntoshiva.htm\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; As far as the book is concerned, I assume it is one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of the following on this list:\n&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.amazon.co.uk/s/ref=nb_ss_w_h_/202-8181829-0418252?url=search-\n&gt;&gt; &gt; alias%3Daps&field-keywords=Swami+Venkatesananda&Go.x=0&Go.y=0&Go=Go\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Perhaps the first or the third?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I am interested in what you say concerning\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Adi Shankara, especially when you mention that he\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;refined&quot; the teachings of Buddha.

I, myself,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; am starting to see less and less to differentiate\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the ultimate Buddhist view and that of the Advaitis\n&gt;&gt; &gt; you so beautifully outlined below:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;There is no I-ness or It-ness or experience.

As always, please ignore this\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fool\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; if something sounds silly.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; If you are interested in Advaitism (non-duality), I recommend reading\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; works of Adi Shankara. He is considered a great teacher of Advaitism\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; an\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; incarnation of Lord Shiva Himself. In fact, a scripture mentions Shiva\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; telling Parvati that he will be born in Kali Yuga as Adi Shankara to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; revive\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Advaitism and to refine the teachings of Buddha.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I personally consider &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; to be the highest treatise on\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Advaitism. I have read many authors, but none matches the brilliance\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Vasishtha. After all, he is a maharshi and one of the saptarshis and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; does\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; show.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Maharshi Vasishtha taught Lord Rama (an incarnation of Lord Vishnu)\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; about\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; self-knowledge in great detail, in the presence of many gods and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; rishis\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; including Maharshi Vishwamitra. These teachings were later taught by\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Maharshi Vaalmiki (author of Ramayana) to Maharshi Bharadwaja. Yoga\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Vaasishtham is thus a detailed account of Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; teachings\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; captured by Maharshi Vaalmiki.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The commentary by Swami Venkatesananda is quite an inspired one and I\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; very\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; very strongly recommend it to everyone deeply interested in the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; highest\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hindu Advaitic philosophy. You can find it on amazon.com.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; In &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; mentioned above, there is a beautiful narrative\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; where\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Maharshi Vasishtha describes to Lord Rama his meeting with Lord Shiva.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Lord\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Shiva teaches Vasishtha how to worship Him. He says, &quot;there are many\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ways\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; worship me that are used by many foolish people who desire various\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; things.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; They may even get various things worshipping me in those ways\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; prescribed\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; some scriptures. But those are inferior methods of worship. Let me\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; tell\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the highest worship that is most dear to me. It is how a self-realized\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; person worships me.&quot; He then describes the method so beautifully.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; It is an absolutely beautiful account. I can say that Shiva&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; teachings\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Vasishtha on the best way to worship Him are the essence of Vedas, the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; essence of BhagavadGeetha and the essence of the highest Hindu\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; philosophy.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; One interested in self-realization and moksha must read Shiva&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; teachings\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and keep them at the back of their mind always.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I don&#39;t mean to be disrespectful to various aagamas and rituals\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; prescribed\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in various scriptures. They all serve a purpose. But, if one views\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; moksha\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; (complete self-realization and the liberation that comes with it) as\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; highest goal, one cannot ignore the worship recommended by Shiva\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Himself\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Vasishtha.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hinduism is indeed a &quot;collection of philosophies&quot;. However, that may\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; be a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; misleading statement. It may suggest some inherent self-contradiction.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; That\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; would be unfair.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Though different ripples of an ocean look different, the underlying\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ocean\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the same. Similarly, the teachings of rishis form a single coherent\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; philosophy (ocean) that appears as many philosophies (ripples) on the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; surface.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; After all, Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti&quot;, which\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; means\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Truth is One, but the learned call differently&quot;. Though Hinduism had\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; no\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;no\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; single founder&quot; or ANY founder for that matter, all rishis tapped the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; same\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Single Source of Knowledge&quot; (the Self, known variously as Brahman,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Shiva,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narayana, Krishna, Allah, Buddha etc) and hence there is a consistency\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; their understanding.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Unfortunately, not everyone can dive deep into the ocean of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; self-knowledge.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Some are more comfortable floating on the surface (which is fun too).\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; The\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; teachings of rishis have something for everyone. This gives the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; appearance\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that rishis taught different contradicting philosophies. In fact, they\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; didn&#39;t.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Like the gentleman below mentioned, there are three main views\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; regarding\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; relationship between individual soul and the supreme soul. However,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; instead\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of viewing them as competing theories, one can also view them as steps\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the same path. I want to share with all an *analogy* given by my\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; spiritual\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; master Dr Manish Pandit:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Imagine God to be a bright star in the sky. When you see from a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; distance,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; star seems tiny and you conclude that there is only one God. If you\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; start\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; moving towards God, you realize as you get closer that the star is in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reality a huge diamond with 330 million faces. Each face is several\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; miles\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; long and wide and has various attributes (gunas). One face may be red\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; hot and another may be blue and cold etc. So, as you get closer to the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; diamond, you have to pick one face to get close to.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Now, when you get too close to a face, the whole world will seem to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; have\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; attributes of that face. For example, if you get too close to a face\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; cold and blue, then the whole world will feel cold and blue to you. In\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; other\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; words, the God you are getting close to is the Supreme god of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; world\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; fills the entire world as you experience it. You think that the whole\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; world\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is filled with his energy. One who gets close to a blue face sees the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; whole\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; world as blue. One who gets close to a yellow face sees the whole\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; world\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; as\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yellow. Similarly, a worshipper of Shiva may get close to Him and see\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Shiva\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; in all deities and all beings. A worshipper of Narayana may get close\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Him\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and see Narayana in all beings.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; No wonder one scripture says that Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva etc all gods\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; came\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; from Narayana, while another scripture says the same about\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mahaganapathi,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; while another scripture says the same thing about Shiva; and so on.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Reaching close to the deity is the ultimate goal in sadhana for one\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; adhering\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to Dwaita siddhanta (duality). For them, getting close to ishta\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; devata,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; securing a place near the feet and seeing the entire world as\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; emanating\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; from\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; that deity is the highest goal. All gods and entire creation are\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; extensions\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of that deity.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; For some, there is a next stage: As you get closer and closer to the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; face\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you picked, you finally merge with it! This is the ultimate goal in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sadhana\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; for one adhering to Visishtaadwaita. You create a vaccum within\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; yourself\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; by\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; completing killing ego-consciousness and the deity in question fills\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; vacuum.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To Advaitis, this communion with a Saguna (&quot;with attributes&quot;) form of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; God\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; not the final goal. The final goal is to break through the face and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jump\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; into the inside of the diamond. As you break through any face of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; diamond\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; and jump into the interior of the diamond, you no longer perceive the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; faces\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of the diamond or the world outside. There are no longer any objects\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; or\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; attributes. There is no I-ness or It-ness or experience. The\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experiencer,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experienced and experience all merge into one. The same thing happens\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; irrespective of from which face the person jumped into the interior of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; diamond. Whether one enters a nirvikalpa samadhi through oneness with\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narayana or through oneness with Sadashiva or through oneness with\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Mahaganapathi, the state reached is identical. The path only is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; different.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Some people can jump into the interior of this diamond without first\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing oneness with a face. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s Adwaitic\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; guru\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Totapuri did not believe in any form and worshipped only the Formless\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Reality. He would directly jump into the interior of the diamond in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; analogy. However, his disciple Ramakrishna Paramahamsa chose to first\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reach\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; oneness with Mother Kaali and then reach the interior of the diamond\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; by\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; jumping from the face of the diamond representing Kaali. Both are\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; valid\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; paths.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; I have written too much tonight. Let me end here now.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
