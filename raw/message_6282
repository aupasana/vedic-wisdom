In Mundaka Upanishad you will find: &quot;This Atman cannot be obtaine=\r\nd by one who is destitute of strength or without earnestness or by penance =\r\nwithout mark. But if a wise man strives after it by those means, then his s=\r\nelf enters into Brahman (God).&quot; Fearlessness is an important qualification =\r\nfor an aspirant. One should be prepared to renounce this life at any moment=\r\n. Without renunciation of this little sensual life, the eternal spiritual l=\r\nife cannot be attained, &#39;Abhayam&#39; (fearlessness) comes first in the Daivi S=\r\nampatti or divine qualities that are enumerated in the Gita- Chapter XVI-I.=\r\n A timid man or a coward dies several times before he actually dies. When y=\r\nou have once decided to take to spiritual practices, stick to it tenaciousl=\r\ny at any cost, nay, at the risk of your life. Come what may. Be bold, Stand=\r\n up. Realise the Truth. Proclaim it everywhere, THOU ART THE IMMORTAL SELF.=\r\n \n\n\n"}}
