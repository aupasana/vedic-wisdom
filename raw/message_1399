How can i again experience the Beloved.\nThat then is the experience o=\r\nf mantra when it is done correctly.\nWhen the sadhak&#39;s personality is efface=\r\nd such that the deity&#39;s personality sits there then the sadhak experiences =\r\nhimself as that Deity(Devata) .\nThere then arises no difference in the sadh=\r\nak or the deity commanding a certain thing to happen( be it what appears to=\r\n be good or be it that which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality i=\r\ns crucial. Ugra devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so=\r\n self identification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution cont=\r\ninues.\nRemember, there is=C2=A0very little=C2=A0according to me which is bl=\r\nack magic. It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and deity is a higher =\r\nshakti such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your po=\r\nwer will be that of God himself( Provided you have Vijnana). After the deat=\r\nh of the body, such a sadhaka joins the realm of the deity or if he was ori=\r\nginally a Nath or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for these beings=\r\n. \nAttacking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads =\r\nof the attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment( Patan=\r\n comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his Shakti causin=\r\ng an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with black magic. Here t=\r\nhere is only action and reaction.(Bit like you attack a normal person, and =\r\nyou will get a result of this from that same Atma whom you harmed maybe 5 t=\r\no 10 lifetimes later. But if you attack somebody who is identifying with th=\r\ne universe and has very few karmas left, then the Universe itself attacks y=\r\nou, because your attack is not on the sadhaka, but on his identification, i=\r\ne God or the universe).\nIf people persist in using the Shakti possesed by a=\r\n small Pisacha, Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti which can be used=\r\n, moreover=C2=A0then their minds and intellects will not be free of identif=\r\nication with the body and so their actions are those which are generally te=\r\nrmed as black magic. These people usually join the same spirits which they =\r\nhave been using after death, this is not an enjoyable experience.\nImagine i=\r\nf somebody is worshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then even in this b=\r\nirth he or she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak may acheive after a=\r\n few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous effort).\nOn the other ha=\r\nnd somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may feel that the 64 th=\r\nings which bind every mantra are crucial and may not acheive in this lifeti=\r\nme.\nAccording to me the proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me su=\r\nggest an easy sadhana.\nIf one is so inclined, then starting on some good da=\r\ny, do 1000 reititions of the Savitri(some=C2=A0call this the=C2=A0Gayatri, =\r\nbut the real Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\nSame time every=\r\n day.\nSame place.\nSame materials.\nSame direction.\nAs little movement as one=\r\n can.\nCount on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\nComplete restrain=\r\nt on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the body), reduce food intake=\r\n, grow a beard.\nDo not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels ar=\r\ne empty before you start.\nContinue this for 100 days and do this whole proc=\r\nedure 3 times.\nSee the difference in your personality before and after.\nLon=\r\ng and short , what is important is that life may be short, so do some sadha=\r\nna, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physically possible.\nI =\r\nhope this clarifies some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nKind Love and Regards\nmanish\nYou may post this on the list as a clarificat=\r\nion from me if you feel that this is suitable.\n=C2=A0\nOn Sun, Mar 1, 2009 a=\r\nt 10:12 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

It takes a lifetime to master thi=\r\ns. \n=C2=A0\nSome may be fascinated by the texture, color and volume of the c=\r\nhaff and miss the grain.\n=C2=A0\nMost people who talk about mantra shastra f=\r\nocus on the chaff and not on the grain.\n=C2=A0\n&gt; You talk of begging God vs=\r\n commanding God? Now where did that come from?\n&gt; How is it related to what =\r\nis under discussion. Perhaps I have missed many\n&gt; mails and am not able to =\r\nget the context. Trying to command God is\n&gt; *BLACK MAGIC* and this is detes=\r\ntable to say the least. The attitude should\n&gt; always be that of a beggar in=\r\n front of God. If anyone has said otherwise, I\n&gt; also disagee with him/her.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nI mentioned the above with respect to the need of thousands of mant=\r\nras and technicalities. If one does not want to command god and wants to be=\r\n a beggar who will take whatever is given, there is no need for thousands o=\r\nf mantras and all the umpteen technicalities.=C2=A0These thousands of mantr=\r\nas and umpteen technicalities are for commanding thousands of different res=\r\nults from god. That is why I talked of commanding vs begging. However, this=\r\n commanding works slightly differently than one may imagine. I will elabora=\r\nte.\n=C2=A0\nAlso, commanding god is NOT black magic. Commanding low level be=\r\nings is black magic, which can be accomplished even by a person not quite e=\r\nlevated spiritually and suffering from a heavy ego. However, commanding hig=\r\nher beings such as gods is possible only for a spiritually=C2=A0elevated pe=\r\nrson with no or extremely small ego. This commanding that I am referring to=\r\n is not an egoistic achievement. In fact, an egoist cannot achieve it. Only=\r\n a person succeeding in completely effacing individual ego can achieve this=\r\n commanding! I will repeat something from the previous mail to clarify:\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n\nThe universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness) , many beings an=\r\nd many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between the=\r\nm. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to pe=\r\nrfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but =\r\nthe mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences the =\r\nmantra. This perfect absorption=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then c=\r\nauses internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (s=\r\npecific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in th=\r\ne universe and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nEach set of &quot;karmic interactions between various objects&quot; is a &quot;resu=\r\nlt&quot;. Various mantras are for various &quot;results&quot;. One may term merging self-a=\r\nwareness in a mantra fully and getting a specific result from it as &quot;comman=\r\nding a result&quot; from god. Whether you like the term or not, it is essentiall=\r\ny that.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nBut the bottomline is this: Only a hig=\r\nhly purified sadhaka of very low ego can command specific results from god =\r\n(not for selfishness or even ego satisfaction, but acting as an unattached=\r\n=C2=A0instrument of Nature fulfilling one&#39;s dharma set by Nature). Various =\r\nmantras and technicalities of mantra shastra taught by rishis are meant for=\r\n such sadhakas.\n=C2=A0\nThose are hardly of use to so many people out there =\r\nwith dense egos seeking specific selfish results. They cannot command speci=\r\nfic results from god (because of their heavy attachment to the result, whic=\r\nh is in turn due to their own attachment to a limited ego), even if they us=\r\ne all the techniques of mantra shastra and all the associated rules of astr=\r\nology. Instead of wasting their time with these technicalities, they will b=\r\ne better off learning to be good beggars at God&#39;s door.\n=C2=A0\nJust pick an=\r\ny prasiddha mantra or a mantra you feel attracted to, without worrying abou=\r\nt so many technicalities, and learn to be humble and surrender to the Lord.=\r\n Patiently wait for him to give you what you want. Like a beggar, take what=\r\never and whenever he gives.\n=C2=A0\nKeep praying every day or every second w=\r\nhen you are able to. Even when you are not praying, remember him in all of =\r\nyour actions. When you enjoy something in the material world, tell yourself=\r\n that it is his and that=C2=A0he gave it to you. If you remember him all th=\r\ne time, slowly the dirt in your mind will start to get cleaned. This fixing=\r\n of attitude is faaaaaaaaaaaar more important than picking the right mantra=\r\n, right weekday, right tithi etc (that too based on unreliable knowledge co=\r\nming from questionable sources!).\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThere may be=\r\n a mountain with thousands of paths (mantra)=C2=A0for climbing it. Each pat=\r\nh may lead to a different spot (different experience) on the top and show a=\r\n different scenery (result). Expert advisors (astrologers) may tell you to =\r\nuse a specific path (mantra) to see a specific scenery (result). But such a=\r\ndvice is useless to a handicapped person without legs (a selfish person wit=\r\nh dense ego). It is relevant only to person with legs and one who is strong=\r\n and sturdy, who can successfully climb the mountain (a reasonably detached=\r\n person with very little ego).\n=C2=A0\nEven when you encounter a person who =\r\nhas legs and can actually climb the mountain, the stress should be on how t=\r\no climb the mountain and traverse the long path, rather than which path to =\r\ntake. The astrologers who are bogged down by all the technicalities and peo=\r\nple who take customized mantra advice from astrologers and think that they =\r\nwill get a result quickly by doing that &#39;powerful&#39; mantra are missing the b=\r\nasic point. The power of a powerful mantra is with respect to the experienc=\r\ne and result obtained *after* one succeeds with the mantra. A partcicularly=\r\n powerful mantra is akin to a path leading to a point atop the mountain whe=\r\nre the view shows a particularly beautiful scenery. But the bottomline is t=\r\nhat you do have to survive the climb along the long path.\n=C2=A0\nWe need to=\r\n emphasize the attitude and approach needed for the long climb, rather than=\r\n emphasizing the choice of the path based on horoscope. It is worth noting =\r\nthat so many great spiritual teachers who came in the last century or two d=\r\nid not emphasize picking the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, =\r\nthey emphasized having the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devoti=\r\non, patience, persistence, discipline, humility etc!!!!=C2=A0*That* is a lo=\r\nt more important and useful than trying to be oversmart with the choice of =\r\nmantra, day etc and impress god.\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n&gt; when shoul=\r\nd the worship of a graha be done?

OK, just spell it =\r\nout. What is the reason for Gandanta being in 0 deg, 120 deg and 240 deg of=\r\n the zodiac if it is not a junction between agni and jala...I want to her y=\r\nour words if you have any. You keep saying Parasara says so and yet there i=\r\ns nothing forthcoming.\n&gt; \n&gt; The rashi is associated with the Aditya as the =\r\nrashi come into existence because of the Sun, which is the agni tattva. Var=\r\na is also agni tattva among the panchanga of Jyotisha. That is why Vaara is=\r\n related to rashi. Karma has been advised in the vaara of the lords of the =\r\nrashi or the hora of the lords of the rashi related to a bhaava and for thi=\r\ns reason, fasting and other such karma related to rashi are also based on t=\r\nhis. [See Prashna Marga for details].\n&gt; \n&gt; Moon is the significator of the =\r\nAroodha. It is the *emotional content* related to the maya manifestation of=\r\n everything in life. Suffering is caused as we do not fathom the karma asso=\r\nciated that resulted in suffering and fasting is a a means of self punishme=\r\nnt and correction related to the raashi where the aroodha is. Just as Agni =\r\nhas the purity to burn the root of sin, fasting on vaara related to the UL =\r\nis surely going to cleanse the sins associated with the suffering in it. Wh=\r\nile this may not give a 100% satisfaction as the *moon* content has not bee=\r\nn addressed, at least the initiation of the aroodha occurs and people find =\r\ntheir partners, get married and get along with life. Proof lies in the pudd=\r\ning and with so many cases where people have fasted on UL days and have got=\r\n result, we have found faith in these teachings reinforced. Why fast? Fasti=\r\nng on vaara is a means to correcting the flaw associated with the raashi. R=\r\naashi is a quantity and hence it\n is related to the material effects of the=\r\n bhava and that is what people are looking for when they come to th astrolo=\r\nger. You have done well to recall my teachings in this =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=\r\n=80=9C remember what I taught =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C Men should worship a=\r\n female deity and women shold worship a male deity for the UL fasting. I wo=\r\nnder if they really follow this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why not give fasting at night instead=\r\n of day? Sun is always good for the Upapada (Jaimini etc) and that is why w=\r\ne have limited this to day fasting and not night fasting as well or 24 hour=\r\n fast. This is my interpolation. [ satisfied J ] Elders would have given lo=\r\nng periods of fast starting from the vaara, like keeping 21 days fast for t=\r\nhe birth of child! You think I should be doing that! You think anyone will =\r\nlsiten. Try it yourself before asking me to advise those hard penance kind =\r\nof fasts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Who says the Moon has nothing to do with the arudha. It is t=\r\nhe sustainer. Now people to an astrologer when they are looking for getting=\r\n married and hardly anyone comes these days asking for prolonging marriage.=\r\n Either they want to get into one or get out of one and into another...astr=\r\nologe rs these days are relegated to helping people make these transitions =\r\npainless and fast. Of course some have come and I have not failed them.

Perhaps I have missed many ma=\r\nils and am not able to get the context. Trying to command God is *BLACK MAG=\r\nIC* and this is detestable to say the least. The attitude should always be =\r\nthat of a beggar in front of God. If anyone has said otherwise, I also disa=\r\ngee with him/her.\n&gt; \n&gt; Prasiddha mantras always give result, even without i=\r\nnitiation and who knows how ready a person is for initation.

His section on remedial measures is full of various homas. I am not =\r\ndismissing those remedies taught by Parasara himself and I am in fact slowl=\r\ny preparing manuals on them so that anybody can do them by themselves.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n [Sanjay Rath:] what about the Puranas? Have you gone through the Navagraha=\r\n mantras given in the Garuda Purana and other puranic literature?\n&gt; \n&gt; Para=\r\nsara did *not* specify the weekday or tithi for most of these homas (e.g. p=\r\nlanetary homas). Only for homas for specific birth doshas (e.g. Amavasya do=\r\nsha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tithi or nakshatra based on the dosha and=\r\n the deity. But the days are not based on any house or arudha in the chart.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] If Amavasya dosha is to be performed on Amavasya, when=\r\n should the worship of a graha be done? Let us say someone wishes to worshi=\r\np Mars (Mangala graha). When do you think this worship should be done?\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Thus, the principles I am questioning are *not* from Parasara.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanja=\r\ny Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna dvaipaayana) got his knowle=\r\ndge and those who wrote it as scribes for him, where did they get it from?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Second, I said what I said in a *context*. People are mentioning compl=\r\nicated principles that are not found in classics or works of rishis and sca=\r\nring people that performing austerities such as fasting on certain days cau=\r\nse &quot;danger to spouse&quot; or &quot;serious doshas&quot; or &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, based on h=\r\noroscope. I find these principles illogical and based on hasty thinking. Th=\r\nere may be a little difference between doing an austerity on different days=\r\n, but my point is that it is smaller compared to the difference between doi=\r\nng and not doing at all and that doing it on a &quot;wrong day&quot; does not cause d=\r\nanger as being suggested.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I am sorry. I missed the cont=\r\next and just saw some mails that were forwarded to me amidst my writing. Bu=\r\nt them its always a pleasure to talk to you as in that many many have benef=\r\nitted, and that includes us as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Third, our shastras primarily tal=\r\nk about worshipping various deities on various days, based on the energy of=\r\n the *deity*. For worshipping a certain deity, certain tithi or weekday or =\r\nnakshatra is better than others. This is based on the deity and irrespectiv=\r\ne of the person worshipping. Let me give an analogy. If a rich man comes ou=\r\nt with more money to give to beggars on a specific day, a beggar is better =\r\noff going and begging on that day. Schedule and mood of the giver is more i=\r\nmportant.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] That=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s not right...at =\r\nleast people who read this will think. Let=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s say Shi=\r\nva worship on Mondays. Shiva is the pratyadhi devata of the Sun and is not =\r\nworshipped on Sundays but on Mondays. NOTE =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C a day a=\r\nfter Sunday! Similarly Narayana is the pratyadhi devata of Mercury and is w=\r\norshipped on Thursdays instead of Wednesdays. NOTE =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C=\r\n again a day after! So what happened to the energy equation? J\n&gt; \n&gt; Choosin=\r\ng the day of a remedy based on the deity is more important and the variatio=\r\nns based on individual horoscope are less important. I am not saying there =\r\nare no horoscopic variations. But they are smaller and, more importantly, I=\r\n question if they are actually well-understood by astrologers today to appl=\r\ny *reliably*. I question over-emphasizing and over-selling unreliable princ=\r\niples of questionable origin and scaring people on that basis.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay=\r\n Rath:] To this I can agree as many have not understood even the basics of =\r\nSanatana dharma!

Instead, I suggest that our ability to use it is limited and we should=\r\n take our limitations into consideration.\n=C2=A0\nThe universe has many loka=\r\ns (planes of consciousness) , many beings and many objects. There are infin=\r\nite karmic interactions possible between them. Accordingly, there are infin=\r\nite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control the mind and *f=\r\nill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in the=\r\n mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorption=\r\n=C2=A0of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes by the f=\r\nlow of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that=\r\n causes corresponding external changes in the universe and corresponding ka=\r\nrmic interactions between various objects.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, this variety of =\r\nmantras, experiences and results is irrelevant to one who does not have suc=\r\nh perfect control over the mind to absorb the mind fully in a mantra. It is=\r\n relevant only to a seer whose self-awareness is quite evolved and hence co=\r\nntrol over mind impeccable. Such seers are extremely extremely rare today. =\r\nMost people are unable to experience any mantra and mantras do not=C2=A0wor=\r\nk for them as they are supposed to.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nJust repe=\r\nating a combination of sounds does not guarantee anything. Some people may =\r\nthink that certain results come when they repeat a mantra certain number of=\r\n times. That is an incorrect notion. A mantra may work for one person quick=\r\nly and another may spend the whole life chanting it and nothing may happen.=\r\n Absorption of the entire mind into a mantra is needed for a mantra to real=\r\nly work and it is much more difficult than one may think.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nA highly learned scholar in the court of a king may be able to=\r\n command the king and get whatever he wants from king. An incapable one is =\r\nbetter off begging the king, rather than trying to command (and failing for=\r\n sure).\n=C2=A0\nSimilarly, most people are better off begging god for what t=\r\nhey want rather than trying to use the right mantra to command what they wa=\r\nnt. A beggar does not need a huge vocabulary or great scholarship or knowle=\r\ndge. Feeling of humility and helplessness, surrender, patience and=C2=A0per=\r\nsistence are what help a beggar succeed. A beggar needs the right attitude =\r\nrather than knowledge. In this age and time, best bet for most people is to=\r\n learn to be a good beggar at god&#39;s door.\n=C2=A0\nWhat people today need for=\r\n material and spiritual progress through remedial measures is a better atti=\r\ntude in begging god rather than a better choice of tools such as mantras an=\r\nd other specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to command a specific result f=\r\nrom god.\n=C2=A0\nIt is worth noting that so many great spiritual teachers wh=\r\no came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking the right mantr=\r\na based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the correct attit=\r\nude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, discipline, h=\r\numility etc.=C2=A0*That* is a lot more important and useful than trying to =\r\nbe oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.\n=C2=A0\n*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nOne more thing. We have many mantras given by rishis,=\r\n but=C2=A0the guidelines from rishis like Parasara on how to pick a mantra =\r\nbased on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers today do not operate s=\r\nolely based on them. They use all kinds of other rules coming from various =\r\ntraditions. They are not free from corruption and imperfection. Most script=\r\nures associate various mantras with various results, irrespective of horosc=\r\nope. For example, irrespective of who is the 6th lord and 8th lord and lord=\r\n of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good for debt control. And=\r\n so on. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today&#39;s astrologers, way beyo=\r\nnd the scope of Parasara&#39;s guidelines.\n=C2=A0\nIf one has a sadguru, I recom=\r\nmend following the word of sadguru rather than that of an astrology theoret=\r\nician.\n=C2=A0\nIf not, there is no foolproof way to know the right path. Pic=\r\nk any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel attracted to) inste=\r\nad of wasting time and then keep working on your attitude. The latter is th=\r\ne key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at god&#39;s door. Choice=\r\n of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary.

Which is perfectly in line with everything I have learnt.\n=C2=A0\nTwo =\r\nstatements you have made contradict standard texts on Jyotish and Mantra Sh=\r\nastra. Please correct me if I am not understanding you well out here -\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n1.=C2=A0Statement 1: *fasting on any day or any tithi* is good so long =\r\nas the sankalpa has been made for the devata you intend to pray to.

This sound=\r\ns like another astrologer I had known some time back whose statements like =\r\nthis coerced me to write Vedic Remedies in Astrology so that people are not=\r\n misled but such pretexts to knowledge.\n=C2=A0\nStatement 2 is an arrogance =\r\nthat the entire mantra shastra is useless and the Rishi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=\r\n=84=A2s were wasting time in giving so many mantras for the same devata, li=\r\nke say thousands of mantras for Vishnu or Hanuman when any one mantra would=\r\n suffice.

The basic point is that Upapada is a rashi and carries en=\r\nergy\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the day ruled by tithi of the 2n=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala energy to vara, and gandanta may\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come into a danger. So, what is the way out.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Why does a rashi carry the energy of vaara only and not that of the tith=\r\ni???? Why does rashi represent vaara or fire?\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because R=\r\naashi were created by Surya and for doing so Surya took 12 forms called the=\r\n Dvadasa Aditya...Narasimha you ask this?? What is happening?\n&gt; \n&gt; After al=\r\nl, Rudra rules over the element of fire and Gouri rules over the element of=\r\n water and one worships Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus (wat=\r\ner) is the karaka for marriage. So one could even say that UL/marriage is r=\r\nepresented by water element and fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the eleme=\r\nnt of water (prosperity and well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could e=\r\nven say that fasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as it b=\r\nrings the fire element represented by weekday to the water of UL and causes=\r\n &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the Maya and is associated with the =\r\nRaashi Narasimha. It is the 12L which is the creator of the UL...just as th=\r\ne mother Gouri creates everything through the shakti of the graha, all the =\r\narudha are created by her due to the lordships of the planets. So fasting o=\r\nn the tithi lorded by the 12th lord will be a *more correct* answer.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\n[Narasimha] We always say that houses (truth)=\r\n are represented by Sun (aatman) and arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind).\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nThus, 12th house is the actual creator and UL is the apparent creato=\r\nr in the field of maya. Houses (truth) should actually be associated with S=\r\nun (aatman) and Shiva (and not Gouri), while arudha padas (perception) shou=\r\nld actually be associated with Moon (mind) and Gouri. After all, that is wh=\r\nat we do in the tripod method in dasa judgment.\n=C2=A0\nThus, it is actually=\r\n more logical to say that 12th house and 12th lord imbibe the agni tattva o=\r\nf Sun and UL and UL lord imbibe the jala tattva of Moon.\n=C2=A0\nIs the abov=\r\ne &quot;*more correct* answer&quot; based on your own thinking or is it from a classi=\r\nc or from tradition?\n=C2=A0\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n&gt; The mantra o=\r\nne meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fasting is far more effective than =\r\nat other times. The conservation of energy otherwise spent on digestion or =\r\nspeech will enable far more effective mantra meditation. So fast or keep mo=\r\nuna and then meditate with a mantra, to maximize the effect of the mantra.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with this. Correct eating is the best bl=\r\nessing for good mantra practise. On days when one fasts the mind is trouble=\r\nd by hunger causing the stomach to burn and churn and this disturbs mantra =\r\njapa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is many many times better than complete=\r\n fasting.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\n[Narasimha] Well, if one can=\r\nnot fast, then one is destined to expend some energy on digestion after all=\r\n and not focus all energy on the mantra. But the bottomline is that shastra=\r\ns say that one should meditate either without or with very little food (nir=\r\naahaaro mitaahaaro). In any case, I hope we agree that meditation sessions =\r\nafter heavy eating are heavily restrained in effectiveness.\n=C2=A0\n\n\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=\r\n Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0&gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching of g=\r\nandanta concepts is quite illogical.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] It is not stretchi=\r\nng ... it is the very definition of gandanta =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C the i=\r\nnterface between fire and water. Put a burning match in a glass of water, t=\r\nhe fire dies...There are other Ganda=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s in the chart =\r\nbut they are not anta (ends). Take Chitra ganda between Kanya and Tula.\n\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\n[Narasimha] Putting a burning match in a =\r\nglass of water does=C2=A0indeed kill fire. But the question is of contact. =\r\nIf I am thinking of fire in my mind while standing in water, it does not ki=\r\nll the fire. There is no contact.\n=C2=A0\nMy point is that the examples give=\r\nn have no real identifiable contact between water and fire.\n=C2=A0\nOne can =\r\nbe creative and come up with a lot of theories. For example, one can say th=\r\nat Moon and Venus are jala tattva and all rasis show agni tattva (then why =\r\nare some rasis marked as agni rasis and some as water rasis etc) and hence =\r\nthe sign occupied by Moon and Venus cause contact between water and fire. T=\r\nhen one can say fasting on the weekdays of the dispositors of Moon and Venu=\r\ns causes gandanta and serious danger.\n=C2=A0\nIt is not enough to show some =\r\nfire and some water. See what counts as contact. Otherwise, one will engage=\r\n in illogical extrapolations.\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt; Th=\r\nree years back you said you are leaving jyotish....then again you told me t=\r\nwo years back and again recently that you are leaving jyotish. Now it is ge=\r\ntting very evident that *jyotish is leaving you*. The knowledge of Jyotish =\r\nis PERFECT =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C individuals embody it in different leve=\r\nls of their understanding and intelligence. \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n\n[Narasimha] Nothing is permanent. What is one&#39;s cannot be taken awa=\r\ny. And one cannot cling on to what is not one&#39;s. Some rejoice when it seems=\r\n like something comes and cry when it seems like something leaves. Some imp=\r\nassionately observe as things seem to come and go and do what they see as t=\r\nheir dharma with the things they seem to have.\n\nJust a factual correction t=\r\nhough: I never said I was leaving Jyotish. For a few years after my spiritu=\r\nal master entered my life, my interest in other things went down (though I =\r\ncontinued to do other things) and my focus on spiritual sadhana intensified=\r\n. So I said that my interest in Jyotish was very low. However, my guru gave=\r\n me a task later. He wanted me to study the teachings of Parasara independe=\r\nntly,=C2=A0meditate=C2=A0on them and share my interpretations with the worl=\r\nd.=C2=A0He said I was very passionate in my Jyotish activities earlier, and=\r\n he wanted me to do the same now but dispassionately and without an attachm=\r\nent. He felt that I still have a contribution to make to Jyotish and wants =\r\nme=C2=A0to do it as an unattached karma.=C2=A0His word is everything for me=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\nWhat I told you recently is not that I was leaving Jyotish but wha=\r\nt I said above.\n=C2=A0\nHowever,=C2=A0if your judgment is correct and=C2=A0i=\r\nf Jyotish is indeed &quot;leaving&quot; me, I am sure my spiritual guru will realize =\r\nit sooner or later and change his command to me.\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote =\r\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt; I can categorically declare one thing with utmost confiden=\r\nce. You pick any weekday or tithi and take a vow to fast or do mouna vrata =\r\n(remain silent) on that weekday or tithi and meditate with a particular man=\r\ntra (any) at the end of the day. You can take a vow to keep that practice f=\r\nor a certain duration of time (say, a few months or years) for a specific p=\r\nurpose. Take a vow and keep the vrata for the duration. If brahmacharya can=\r\n be kept for the duration of the vrata, there is nothing like it!\n&gt; \n&gt; [San=\r\njay Rath:] This is a fine=C2=A0 statement but then you seem to be saying th=\r\nat the Puranas and other teachings of the seers is of not much relevance. O=\r\nf course you are right as it will be spiritually beneficial. For example, a=\r\n person wishing to marry should not fast on UL days and should choose any d=\r\nay (all days are the same) or any tithi (all tithi are the same) and start =\r\nfasting and do a mantra (any mantra!!) and then in a few days, or (maybe) a=\r\n few months (or maybe) a few years ... or maybe (what you did not say), a f=\r\new lifetimes, the marriage will happen! I cannot say you are wrong, so I ag=\r\nree that what you say is right.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\n[Naras=\r\nimha] This is a gross exaggeration.\n=C2=A0\nIs all that is being taught and =\r\npracticed now strictly from &quot;Puranas and other teachings of the seers&quot;?\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nI did not say all days and tithis are the same. Of course, there is som=\r\ne difference. But, it is not as big as being made here.\n=C2=A0\nTo make khoa=\r\n, whether one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or milk of a brown cow or a bla=\r\nck cow or a Jersey cow or another cow does make some difference. But it is =\r\nsecondary. To say that &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas&quot; (see the quoted mails =\r\nfor such claims)=C2=A0can be caused by a wrong choice is wrong. To say that=\r\n a wrong choice means khoa will take 100 years to make is also a gross=C2=\r\n=A0exaggeration.\n=C2=A0\nThe main thing is that you need milk and sugar. If =\r\none is confused by endless claims of khoa making consultants and ends up no=\r\nt making khoa at all, that will be sad. In such a case, one can simply pick=\r\n some milk or the other, take sugar and start cooking khoa. It will take an=\r\n extra half hour, but the job will be done.\n=C2=A0\nI request Jyotishis to b=\r\nehave responsibly and humbly and not engage in scare-mongering and say that=\r\n a speicifc austerity (fasting on a specific weekday or=C2=A0tithi in a cha=\r\nrt) can cause &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas&quot;. No wonder some spiritual teach=\r\ners look down upon Jyotish and dismiss it. Such unbalanced attitude and sel=\r\nf-importance from us does not help our cause!\n=C2=A0\nYes, Jyotish is helpfu=\r\nl, but let us not oversell it or overplay the importance.. .\n=C2=A0\n&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; =\r\nBegin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt; Gem stones may harm when used incorrectly. But=\r\n, austerities like prayers, fasting, mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVE=\r\nR do you any harm. If your body can take fasting, you can do it on any week=\r\nday or tithi without too many calculations.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Brahmachary=\r\na is good for someone planning to have a baby or one who cannot conceive an=\r\nd this is kept for some period before the appointed date of nisheka. Brahma=\r\ncharya is good for marriage?! I think you are mistaking abstinence from phy=\r\nsical union as Brahmacharya. Oh no its so different.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote=C2=\r\n=A0&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\n[Narasimha] Of course, brahmacharya is much more, but also=\r\n very difficult for most. Even physical celibacy is a good enough austerity=\r\n.

It is funny that I should be typing this email on an Ekadashi day, when=\r\n many Vaishnavas fast irrespective of their horoscopes.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:]=\r\n I write on dvadasi when so many vasihnava also fast and keep great austeri=\r\nties. J Any difference?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here is my point and view about the quest=\r\nion raised. 2nd bhava is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the bhava of Vishnu, sustainer, and if we f=\r\nast on the day of UL in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd house, we bring insult to Vishnu who pro=\r\nvides the food for us.\n&gt; \n&gt; My dear Zoran, please allow me to express my di=\r\nsagreement.\n&gt; \n&gt; Austerities can never be seen as an insult to Vishnu. Self=\r\n-deprivation of 2nd house matters such as food (fasting) or speech (mouna v=\r\nrata - vow of silence) are austerities. Giving up food or speech is not an =\r\ninsult to Vishnu just as giving up sex (i.e. brahmacharya) is not an insult=\r\n to Sukracharya (Venus).\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I though Brahma was very angry=\r\n that his sons decided not to have progeny and stayed celibate. So He creat=\r\ned others. Why was Brahma angry when his sons remained celibate? Why should=\r\n Sukracharya be angry if someone is celibate? How is it an insult or not an=\r\n insult to Sukracharya? You are taking planet signification of Venus for 7H=\r\n ...and linking this to creation process...which is wrong Narasimha. Brahma=\r\n is seen from lords of dusthana 6, 8 and 12 from lagna or 7th which is....y=\r\nou know this.There is nothing wrong with the 7th house as it is necessary f=\r\nor procreation. It is only the link of this with the Brahma graha that caus=\r\nes it to become a serious shad-ripu. Married people are as eligible for mok=\r\nsha as unmarried ones and bachelors. It depends on the following of dharma =\r\nand ashrama.\n&gt; \n&gt; Various gods bestow various things on us, some at the gro=\r\nss physical level and some at the subtle spiritual level. As we overcome ou=\r\nr dependendency on gross things, we make progress at the subtle level.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n If one eats food, a good amount of internal fire (and subtle internal ener=\r\ngy associated with it) is used for digesting it and for generating physical=\r\n energy from it. If one fasts, that subtle energy is unused and available f=\r\nor other things. This is a tremendous benefit. As a result, one can better =\r\ndigest mantras and spiritual food available all around one.\n&gt; \n&gt; The mantra=\r\n one meditates with at the end of a day&#39;s fasting is far more effective tha=\r\nn at other times. The conservation of energy otherwise spent on digestion o=\r\nr speech will enable far more effective mantra meditation. So fast or keep =\r\nmouna and then meditate with a mantra, to maximize the effect of the mantra=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with this. Correct eating is the best =\r\nblessing for good mantra practise. On days when one fasts the mind is troub=\r\nled by hunger causing the stomach to burn and churn and this disturbs mantr=\r\na japa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is many many times better than comple=\r\nte fasting.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; However, to be honest, I have not heard this about 2n=\r\nd lord and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tithi. The basic point is that Upapada is a rashi and car=\r\nries energy\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the day ruled by tithi of=\r\n the 2nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala energy to vara, and gandant=\r\na may\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come into a danger. So, what is the way =\r\nout.\n&gt; \n&gt; Why does a rashi carry the energy of vaara only and not that of t=\r\nhe tithi???? Why does rashi represent vaara or fire?\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Be=\r\ncause Raashi were created by Surya and for doing so Surya took 12 forms cal=\r\nled the Dvadasa Aditya...Narasimha you ask this?? What is happening?\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nfter all, Rudra rules over the element of fire and Gouri rules over the ele=\r\nment of water and one worships Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Ven=\r\nus (water) is the karaka for marriage. So one could even say that UL/marria=\r\nge is represented by water element and fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings th=\r\ne element of water (prosperity and well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One =\r\ncould even say that fasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited =\r\nas it brings the fire element represented by weekday to the water of UL and=\r\n causes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the Maya and is associated wi=\r\nth the Raashi Narasimha. It is the 12L which is the creator of the UL...jus=\r\nt as the mother Gouri creates everything through the shakti of the graha, a=\r\nll the arudha are created by her due to the lordships of the planets. So fa=\r\nsting on the tithi lorded by the 12th lord will be a *more correct* answer.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching of gandanta concepts is q=\r\nuite illogical.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] It is not stretching ... it is the very=\r\n definition of gandanta =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=80=9C the interface between fire=\r\n and water. Put a burning match in a glass of water, the fire dies...There =\r\nare other Ganda=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s in the chart but they are not anta=\r\n (ends). Take Chitra ganda between Kanya and Tula.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now one more thing:=\r\n Marriage is a yoga between two souls and why not suggest fasting on the yo=\r\nga day of the UL lord?\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay Rath:] What! What a brilliant suggestio=\r\nn.. .why don=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t you start it?=C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Now suppose instead of 11th house if Mercury goes to 12th house or 4 \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n house then you cannot choose Dwadashi or Chaturthi for the same \n&gt; &gt; becau=\r\nse these thithis are ruled by Mercury only and fasting on these \n&gt; &gt; tithis=\r\n will create serious doshas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Picking tithi based on house (12th house =\r\n- Dwadashi, 4th house - Chaturthi) is illogical as there are 12 houses only=\r\n and more tithis.\n&gt; I have realized one thing over the years - If something=\r\n is not structurally sound, it is most likely false knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; [Sanjay=\r\n Rath:] J No comments\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; I can categorically declare one thing=\r\n with utmost confidence. You pick any weekday or tithi and take a vow to fa=\r\nst or do mouna vrata (remain silent) on that weekday or tithi and meditate =\r\nwith a particular mantra (any) at the end of the day.
