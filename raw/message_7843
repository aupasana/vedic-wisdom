I live in Toronto and visit a local temple every Saturday. At this temple, the most busiest areas are the Siva linga and murti os Sani bhagavan. Even though it is written near the murti of Sani bhagavan that daal and oil offerings should only be in small quantities, people just dump daal and oil and ultimately all of this is going to the garbage. \n\nLong time ago, I was following a practice of offering some food to birds. The birds would not usually come anywhere but close to where I lived at the time, a parking lot for Sears would see a lot of birds in early morning and that is where I used to go. Once I was amazed at what I saw, someone had dumped a whole sack of rice there...perhaps to feed the birds. I wondered than what was the point of such an exercise?\n\nIf these people were to put some little thought to what they were doing instead of making mindless offerings at the advice of some astrologer and perhaps offer the same to where it us needed, it would di a lot more good.\n\nRegards,\nBhupendra\n\n------------------------------\nOn Sat, 18 Feb, 2012 11:26 AM EST Narasimha PVR Rao wrote:\n\n&gt;Namaste friends,\n&gt;\n&gt;This is an age of growing populations and food shortages. A lot of \n&gt;people are starving without food to eat. As those who can afford food \n&gt;waste the limited food that is available, that jacks up food prices and \n&gt;makes it even more inaccessible to starving people. This is already a \n&gt;serious problem according to scientists and I am afraid will get much \n&gt;worse in coming decades.\n&gt;\n&gt;Given this, wasting food is a really really really terrible sin in \n&gt;today&#39;s times. Please don&#39;t waste food. This includes:\n&gt;\n&gt;(1) Cooking more food than you need and throwing it away,\n&gt;(2) Serving more food than you can eat in your plate and throwing it \n&gt;away\n&gt;(3) Buying more vegetables/fruits than you need and letting them get \n&gt;spoiled\n&gt;\n&gt;Please treat Mother Annapurna (personification of food that sustains us) \n&gt;with respect, love and humility (rather than arrogance, contempt and \n&gt;pride). World (and we) needs her blessings and kindness.\n&gt;\n&gt;*        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt;On a similar note, some ladies do rituals where chick peas soaked in \n&gt;water, fruits etc, sweets etc are distributed to other ladies. I have \n&gt;seen so many ladies casually get these food items, let them rot and then \n&gt;throw them away. The notion that giving food to people is good karma is \n&gt;based on the assumption that they actually eat it or use otherwise. If \n&gt;they waste it, it is bad karma for both parties.\n&gt;\n&gt;Please do not accept any food that you cannot use. Also, don&#39;t \n&gt;distribute food to people who do not need it. Instead, feed homeless, \n&gt;needy people. Doing rituals with no common sense and just for the heck \n&gt;of it, is not good. Such rituals produce no results whatsoever. Blindly \n&gt;adhering to traditions that are doing no good really, is like dressing a \n&gt;corpse in beautiful clothes and jewellery. Use common sense and do \n&gt;*real* good to others and the world, than engaging in fake *symbols* \n&gt;that in reality harm the world.\n&gt;\n&gt;Sorry for the strong language, but I do see many people abusing Mother \n&gt;Annapoorna and I think this is terrible for the world. This needs to \n&gt;change.\n&gt;\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
