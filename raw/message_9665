If we are trying to break free of karmic =\r\ncycle so hard why we got into this in the first place. It seems like humani=\r\nty made a wrong move when it got attached to thought and the action got cor=\r\nrupted.

Le=\r\nt me try to put all this into a perspective here.=C2=A0\n\nNow my understandi=\r\nng is that all these four different path lead to the same point or the end =\r\nresult and that is self realization. No matter what path or approach you ta=\r\nke the end result or the truth has to be the same. It cannot be two differe=\r\nnt thing for two different people and in that case it is not the Truth. The=\r\n path one adopts may be of hindu persuasion or some other religious persuas=\r\nion the end result has to be the same. Not only the end result one has to c=\r\nome to a point where one has an insight or a perception that finishes the e=\r\ngo or self directed activity.=C2=A0\n\nKarma is a natural result of the freed=\r\nom that Nature has bestowed upon man. Karma has no meaning without freedom =\r\nto act. I do mistakes and create imbalance only when I have freedom to act =\r\nand as such I have pay it back and restore balance in Nature. To have the f=\r\nreedom to act I have to accept Karma too. It all makes perfect sense to me.=\r\n=C2=A0\n\nNow due to karmic overload it may become very hard for large number=\r\ns of people to get out of this cycle. I am not sure if Nature allows one to=\r\n be free of this attachment without a payback. Now there is a train of thou=\r\nght which says that one can look into the whole nature of this attachment a=\r\nt one shot and can be free of it. Instead of fixing one thing after another=\r\n look at this whole thing to the root , have a perception and get out of it=\r\n. In a sense our ancestors were intelligent that they devised some way to c=\r\nlear this Karma but it seems like for large numbers of people these will be=\r\ncome crutches rather than help to get out of the karmic cycle and lead an e=\r\nxistence where one is free to act. If my previous karma is influencing my a=\r\nction then I am not free.=C2=A0\n\nIs it possible for someone to look into th=\r\nis whole process of attachment and have an insight and be free of it right =\r\nnow....\n\n\n________________________________\n From: Narasimha P.V.R.

These paths get one started in the walk towards the same end poin=\r\nt - Self-realization.\n\n=C2=A0\n&gt; To be free is to be awakened.\n=C2=A0\nNot ex=\r\nactly. Awakening is just a step towards freedom. Freedom comes in the end a=\r\nfter walking a path for enough time after awakening.\n=C2=A0\nAn unawakened s=\r\nadhaka practicing jnana yoga reads books and talks eloquently about how eve=\r\nrything is god, but looks at different people, objects and experiences with=\r\n a different attitude. He becomes happy (if not externally, atleast interna=\r\nlly) when people praise him and becomes upset when people criticize him, an=\r\nd so on. An awakened sadhaka practicing jnana yoga starts to honestly conte=\r\nmplate one&#39;s actions, words, thoughts (and even instincts finally) and slow=\r\nly weeds out conditioning that makes one look at different transient things=\r\n differently. As his equanimity increases, still there will be episodes of =\r\ngetting carried away. As he employs contemplation and self-correction more =\r\nand more, such episodes will become less and less frequent and one will bec=\r\nome liberated in the end.\n=C2=A0\nAn unawakened sadhaka practicing karma yog=\r\na passionately engages in dharmik actions for the benefit of others. He get=\r\ns elated and feels proud when good results come and becomes upset when bad =\r\nresults come. An awakened sadhaka practicing karma yoga starts to have deta=\r\nchment to results. When something happens which makes him elated, proud, as=\r\nhamed or upset, he will not think much about it, take it as god&#39;s prasad an=\r\nd think about what is the right action for him right now. As his detachment=\r\n increases, still there will be episodes of getting carried away. As one be=\r\ncomes more and more detached (to results of actions), such episodes will be=\r\ncome less and less frequent and one will become liberated in the end.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nAn unawakened sadhaka practicing raja yoga goes through yama, niyama, p=\r\nratyahara, dhyana, dharana etc. His psychic life force may even arise and a=\r\nscend. He may have various experiences and may feel proud or become attache=\r\nd to them. An awakened sadhaka practicing raja yoga will not not lose self-=\r\ncontrol in the face of anything and will keep the focus on samadhi. He will=\r\n not be distracted by anything that comes on the way and keep perfecting co=\r\nncentration and self-control so that samadhi (deep concentration on the unc=\r\nonditioned Self) comes. In the beginning, one may be in samadhi state now a=\r\nnd then. As practice is perfected, one can be in it all the time and become=\r\n liberated.\n=C2=A0\nAn unawkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga is devoted t=\r\no god and worships him/her as much as one can, but will project his ego, co=\r\nnditioning and desires onto his worship and hence onto the god he worships.=\r\n For example, he may think &quot;I worship the highest god while that person wor=\r\nships a lower god. I am better&quot; or &quot;I am worshipping god everyday. I will g=\r\net so and so result&quot; or &quot;I worship god more than that person. I am better&quot;.=\r\n An awkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga has little expectation, pride et=\r\nc. Worship becomes not about him but about god! He worships god and marvels=\r\n at the power that holds this cosmos together - the power that runs things =\r\ninfinitismally smaller than a boson and infinitely larger than a galaxy. He=\r\n will look at himself as a fully insignificant particle in front a supreme =\r\npower. His desires, likes, dislikes, conditioning and agendas start to seem=\r\n too insignificant in front of contemplating about that supreme power. Even=\r\n as that\n devotional spirit increases, there will be episodes when one beco=\r\nmes self-centered in one&#39;s worship. But with practice, one loses oneself co=\r\nmpletely and surrenders completely to the supreme power and become liberate=\r\nd in the end.\n=C2=A0\nIn each path, one may walk the path without making any=\r\n significant progress for a long time. As one starts to imbibe the inherent=\r\n qualities of the path, some internal transformation will kick in. Yet, the=\r\n force of prior conditioning, coming from many lives, is too strong to over=\r\ncome. One keeps walking..\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology=\r\n & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n\n\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt; From: Prasad Pavitram &lt;vimal992000@ya=\r\nhoo.com&gt;\n&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;Sent: Saturday, August 24, 2013 10:04 AM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re=\r\n: which path to choose?-a dialog\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;Narasimha=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0I agree with you=\r\nr explanation of all four different types of yoga and also bhakti yoga bein=\r\ng the safest of all kinds.

The purpose behind all this=\r\n should be to free oneself from karmic bindings and be free of the =C2=A0bo=\r\nndage. That has to be the core purpose of any type of yoga. To be free is t=\r\no be awakened.=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;No matter what path you follow ultimately there s=\r\nhould be a perception where one sees the thought for what it is and there i=\r\ns a cleansing of the action. And there will be no karma when you are NOT bo=\r\nund to the action.

I am not sure.=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Your movie analogy is brilli=\r\nant because currently life is a movie which we take for real.

Can all karma be ended in an in=\r\nstant with the help of a perception and how that can be brought about...are=\r\n I think are the most fundamental questions.

It is very=\r\n much\n&gt;&gt; possible and in fact is a measure of self realized people.\n&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;Indeed, one can carve one&#39;s own niche by combining multiple paths. They a=\r\nre not meant to be mutually exclusive.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;I&#39;ll quote Swami Vivekanand=\r\na from his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; where he makes a comment on the 4 paths:\n&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&quot;Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinit=\r\ny\n within by controlling\n nature: external and internal. Do this either by =\r\nwork or worship or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all=\r\n of these - and be free.&quot;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Here are my 2 cents.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Jnana yoga=\r\n emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work a=\r\nnd detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakt=\r\ni yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatev=\r\ner is natural to one and try to develop that quality. However, wisdom, deta=\r\nched action, self-control and surrender to the Supreme are not mutually exc=\r\nlusive. As one of these qualities develops nicely in one, others will autom=\r\natically develop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or one=\r\nness) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Forget about =\r\nhoroscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I str=\r\nongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna adv=\r\nised\n against it. Controlling body and mind and forcing the psychic life fo=\r\nrce to purify and ascend requires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. I=\r\nn this age of polluted air, water and food, nadis accumulate great amounts =\r\nof obstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just my view, b=\r\nut what Ramakrishna explicitly taught in &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one of th=\r\ne greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas fro=\r\nm pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage ev=\r\nen him to practice it.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a dis=\r\ntinct danger of falling into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People o=\r\nf this age are not sincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude=\r\n that &quot;all is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t ma=\r\ntter. It&#39;s all a delusion anyway&quot; without fully overcoming all innate condi=\r\ntioning that reinforces duality in consciousness every instant. Kind\n of li=\r\nke declaring wisely in a movie that &quot;it&#39;s just a movie and not reality&quot;, bu=\r\nt flinching in every scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without ab=\r\nsolute honesty, sincerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic to=\r\no.

Let me try to put all this into=\r\n a perspective here.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); f=\r\nont-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; b=\r\nackground-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new =\r\nroman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transparent; font-style=\r\n: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now my understanding is that all these four different path=\r\n lead\n to the same point or the end result and that is self realization. No=\r\n matter what path or approach you take the end result or the truth has to b=\r\ne the same. It cannot be two different thing for two different people and i=\r\nn that case it is not the Truth. The path one adopts may be of hindu persua=\r\nsion or some other religious persuasion the end result has to be the same. =\r\nNot only the end result one has to come to a point where one has an insight=\r\n or a perception that finishes the ego or self directed activity.&nbsp;&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;=\r\ntimes new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transparent; =\r\nfont-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0=\r\n);font-size:16px;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new\n york&#39;, times, serif;b=\r\nackground-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;Karma is a natural result o=\r\nf the freedom that Nature has bestowed upon man. Karma has no meaning witho=\r\nut freedom to act. I do mistakes and create imbalance only when I have free=\r\ndom to act and as such I have pay it back and restore balance in Nature. To=\r\n have the freedom to act I have to accept Karma too. It all makes perfect s=\r\nense to me.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; =\r\nfont-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color:=\r\n transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0,=\r\n 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, se=\r\nrif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Now due to karmic =\r\noverload it may become very hard for large numbers of people to get out of =\r\nthis cycle. I am not sure if Nature allows one to be free of this attachmen=\r\nt without a payback. Now there is a train of\n thought which says that one c=\r\nan look into the whole nature of this attachment at one shot and can be fre=\r\ne of it. Instead of fixing one thing after another look at this whole thing=\r\n to the root , have a perception and get out of it. In a sense our ancestor=\r\ns were intelligent that they devised some way to clear this Karma but it se=\r\nems like for large numbers of people these will become crutches rather than=\r\n help to get out of the karmic cycle and lead an existence where one is fre=\r\ne to act. If my previous karma is influencing my action then I am not free.=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family=\r\n: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; background-color: transparen=\r\nt; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-s=\r\nize: 16px; font-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; backgr=\r\nound-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Is it possible for someone to=\r\n look into this whole process of\n attachment and have an insight and be fre=\r\ne of it right now....&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: &#39;tim=\r\nes new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-family: &#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;=\r\n &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha P.V.R.

He will look at himself as a fully insignificant\n particle=\r\n in\n front a supreme power. His desires, likes, dislikes, conditioning and =\r\nagendas start to seem too insignificant in front of contemplating about tha=\r\nt supreme power. Even as that devotional spirit increases, there will be ep=\r\nisodes when one becomes self-centered in one&#39;s worship.

The purpose behind all this should be to free onese=\r\nlf from karmic bindings and be free of the &nbsp;bondage. That has to be th=\r\ne core purpose of any\n type of yoga.

And ther=\r\ne will be no karma when you are NOT bound to the action. Now does these fou=\r\nr types of yogas prepare one for this perception or at least create more pr=\r\nobability or mental states where such a thing is possible.

I am not sure if it is a matter of time or pract=\r\nice. It is an error in perception where we identify with our thoughts and a=\r\nct out. Does these yogas help see this and come out of this error?? Can all=\r\n karma be ended in an instant with the help of a perception and how that ca=\r\nn be brought about...are I think are the most fundamental questions.

It is very much&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; possible and in fact is a measure of self realized people.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Indeed, one can carve one&#39;s own niche by combining multiple paths. They ar=\r\ne not meant to be mutually exclusive.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ll quote Swami Vivekan=\r\nanda from his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; where he makes a comment on the 4 paths:&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this di=\r\nvinity\n within by controlling\n nature: external and internal. Do this eithe=\r\nr by work or worship or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, o=\r\nr all of these - and be free.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Here are my 2 cents.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasi=\r\nzes on work and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-m=\r\nastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One ca=\r\nn pick whatever is natural to one and try to develop that quality. However,=\r\n wisdom, detached action, self-control and surrender to the Supreme are not=\r\n mutually exclusive. As one of these qualities develops nicely in one, othe=\r\nrs will automatically develop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in =\r\n&quot;Yoga&quot; or oneness) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespecti=\r\nve of that, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Eve=\r\nn Ramakrishna advised\n against it. Controlling body and mind and forcing th=\r\ne psychic life force to purify and ascend requires strict yama and niyama a=\r\nnd clean nadis. In this age of polluted air, water and food, nadis accumula=\r\nte great amounts of obstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is no=\r\nt just my view, but what Ramakrishna explicitly taught in &quot;Gospel of Ramakr=\r\nishna&quot; (one of the greatest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged several o=\r\nf his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekananda, but did=\r\n not encourage even him to practice it.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Jnana yoga is brillian=\r\nt, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the delusional trap of ps=\r\neudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sincere/honest/smart enough for it.=\r\n It is easy to delude that &quot;all is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it=\r\n&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s all a delusion anyway&quot; without fully overco=\r\nming all innate conditioning that reinforces duality in consciousness every=\r\n instant. Kind\n of like declaring wisely in a movie that &quot;it&#39;s just a movie=\r\n and not reality&quot;, but flinching in every scary scene, crying in every sad =\r\nscene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincerely and earnestness, jnana yoga =\r\ncan be problematic too. A long path of constant contemplation and self-corr=\r\nection can be reduced to a quick delusional jump to the end.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I=\r\nMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga are the most s=\r\nuitable and safest.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;=\r\nAstrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blan=\r\nk&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;=\r\n/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, Vishnu Jandhy=\r\nala &lt;jvishnu@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Dear Ms. Maja,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; Namaste&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Now different type of 4 yogas based on ayana/k=\r\nendra:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Dharma ayana - Gyana yoga- lagna and its t=\r\nrines&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt; Artha ayana - Karma yoga -\n 10th bhava and its trines&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; Kama ayana - Raja yoga- 7th bhava and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; M=\r\noksha ayana - Bhakti yoga - 4th bhava and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagavat Gita, you can check it, I assure&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; there are four of them.
