Ramakrishna immediately woke up Ra=\r\nkhal and left the place, avoiding giving any reasons to people in the house=\r\n.\n\nGopalers Ma was somebody who was immersed in god and still had such enti=\r\nties/beings around?\n\nAlso brings the question why is it that the entities/b=\r\neings in sad state left alone by psychics and spiritual persons without doi=\r\nng anything for their upliftment? \n\nIs it that such beings/entities cannot =\r\nbe helped or is it just wise to leave them alone if they do not want to be =\r\ndisturbed?\n\nIs their any Vedic explanations/suggestions on such situations =\r\nas above?\n\nBest Regards\nShashi\n \n\n\n"}}
