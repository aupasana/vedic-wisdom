If 45 minute is long tim=\r\ne, sometimes, and you wish to do Homam in 25 minutes then it is a good idea=\r\n to use Mantras (Poorvaangam, Aahvaahan, Main Homam, Uttarangam etc...) giv=\r\nen in Super short.\n&gt; &gt; In any Homam, Most Important parts are Specific Aahu=\r\ntis offered with Mantras of the relevant deities AND Meditation. So i sugge=\r\nst removing that thought of &#39;Lack of Satisfaction&#39; from your mind. For impr=\r\noving the feeling of Contentment, It may be a good idea to select one mantr=\r\na in particular and offer it say for 21 or 54 or 108 times. IMHO, another `=\r\nTrim down&#39; version may not be a good idea. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do not know if i cou=\r\nld answer you.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com, &quot;biswa108&quot; &lt;biswa1975@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; NAMASKAR\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I seeks help on regarding this topic...may Rajarshi, Krishnendu, A=\r\nrnab, Utpal or anyone please take my issue...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; best regards,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Biswajit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;biswa108&quot; &lt;=\r\nbiswa1975@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PRANAM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Respected Narasi=\r\nmha Ji and Others,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sometimes a trim down version is very u=\r\nseful for me when there is time constraint for daily Ganapati Homam...\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Currently the short-procedure takes about 45 minutes for me, y=\r\nes I know there is a super-short procedure, but that lacks many Mantra/Sans=\r\nkrit-verse and sometimes mind is not satisfied with the bare-minimum. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, could you please suggest/mark the various steps with impor=\r\ntant Mantras on priority basis on the short-procedure of the Ganapati Homam=\r\n, so that one could trim down the homam process in the case of time constra=\r\nint but mind should be satisfy enough for the purpose...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b=\r\nest regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Biswajit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
