I was actually \nfascinated by the &#39;Kriya=\r\n Yoga&#39; mentioned in the book and there arose \na deep desire to learn this K=\r\nriya yoga. I came to reading the \nchapter on &#39;Babaji&#39; in the same book. In =\r\nthe very chapter, Yogananda \nhas mentioned that Babaji is living since many=\r\n centuries and he is \nstill present in physical form. Anybody who sincerely=\r\n asks for \nspiritual help, he/she will be helped by Babaji even today. Read=\r\ning \nthe above, I instantly close my eyes and deeply prayed Babaji. I \npray=\r\ned that if you are still there guiding spiritual people then \nplease help m=\r\ne for learning this Kriya yoga.\nAnd to my pleasant surprise, within a month=\r\n I was introduced \n(accidentally/unplanned way) to Sudarshan Kriya Yoga of =\r\nArt of \nLiving organization by Sri Sri Ravishankar. Few more such inner \nex=\r\nperiences happened which convinced me that Babaji is there and \ngave me eno=\r\nugh faith in Yogananda and Sri Sri Ravi Shankar&#39;s \ngreatness as real yogis.=\r\n\n\nMy strong opinion is that if one goes by media (Print or electronic \nor i=\r\nnternet), there are all the chances that most people will be \nconfused and =\r\nwould not be able to decide about somebody&#39;s character \nor caliber. Even Sw=\r\nami Vivekananda in his time was accused for many \nwrong practices in USA an=\r\nd U.K. hence personally, I rely upon my own \nheart and own experiences. I a=\r\nlways stay far away from Print as well \nas TV reports. Big NO NO. to News c=\r\nhannels. Most of them are \nspreading nonsense. They have become script writ=\r\ner rather than \nauthentic news providers. Even, random and reckless opinion=\r\ns of \npeople in general is many a times misguiding/confusing.\n\n  \nSame way,=\r\n for my Beloved Thakur, I relied on the same ways. After I \nread Gospel, I =\r\nwas drawn in to events which ultimately took me to My \nGuru of this life (I=\r\nt took 4 years). And it can not be a coincidence \nthat my Guru is also very=\r\n very much attached to Thakur Ramkrsihna. I \nrate Ramkrsihna Kathamruta as =\r\nthe Best `darkness dispelling&#39; book I \nread till date and now spiritual boo=\r\nks also doesn&#39;t interest me \nmuch. Enough of reading, now it&#39;s high time fo=\r\nr *Doing*. \n\n\nHence my input to all those serious spiritualist, who are als=\r\no \nseriously confused&#61516;, that listen to you heart, Pray for the clari=\r\nty, \nMeditate, keep doing Sadhanas and observe the chain of events \nhappeni=\r\nng around you. Those are the best ways to get the clarity \nabout any spirit=\r\nual person or future spiritual Guru rather than \ndepending, more than requi=\r\nred,  upon Media and such external inputs \nwho have hardly any sincere spir=\r\nitual interest.\n\nI clarify here that I am an almost a novice who is struggl=\r\ning in the \npath of spirituality but still felt that my own inputs out of \n=\r\nexperience may help few.\n\n\nSpiritually yours,\nUtpal \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, Lakshmi Kary &lt;lakshmikary@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hare Rama Krishn=\r\na\n&gt;   Dear Narasimha.\n&gt;   Sorry I got my people and lineages all confused! =\r\nWas reading \nabout too many people lately.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Also last night  I saw=\r\n a  documentary on religious leaders, \ncults etc.\n&gt;   People want to see Go=\r\nd so badly they are very eager to push \nanyone who is willing to claim to b=\r\ne special up on a pedestal.That \nhappened with my ex , he got up there,felt=\r\n it wasn&#39;t right and tried \nto climb down, but his&quot;disciples&quot; didn&#39;t want h=\r\nim to.\n&gt;   They continued to perpetuate falsehoods about his purity, and \na=\r\nll sorts of cover ups.\n&gt;   God and Jesus are living in some many places. So=\r\nmetimes there \nare several people simultaneously claiming to be Jesus in an=\r\ny psych \nunit across the world/\n&gt;   Its amazing where and to within whom pe=\r\nople see &quot;God&quot;.\n&gt;   Isnt a spiritual master, guru, living like a mortal in =\r\nall \ncapacities while telling others how to find realization sort of \nhypoc=\r\nritical and bizarre?\n&gt;    \n&gt;   There is one fellow who used to be a heroin =\r\naddict and now he \nsays he is Jesus and has a huge following. they are will=\r\ning to do \nwhatever he says and they give him money and all sorts of things=\r\n.\n&gt;   Yesterday I went on the Internet, and looked at some many so \ncalled =\r\nyogis, preachers etc\n&gt;   IN the USA I cant begin to tell you the number of =\r\nreligious \nleaders that were revered as &quot;God&quot; or some other incarnation.\n&gt; =\r\n  India is no different, perhaps worse because people have a \nnatural respe=\r\nct for sadhus , yogis etc and more yogis can get away \nwith pretending to b=\r\ne a renunciate.\n&gt;   I believe God appears in different forms in different p=\r\nlaces and \ntimes to attract people who are looking for him and to associate=\r\n \nwith his devotees..\n&gt;   Now that Documentary TV program and your posts go=\r\nt my mind \nswimming.\n&gt;   What are principles of religion?

But Ramakrishna \nParamahamsa stands out in one way. He i=\r\ns one master who mastered \nevery single path. He mastered bhakti yoga, jnaa=\r\nna yoga, karma yoga \nand even raaja yoga. He worshipped and experienced Ram=\r\na, Krishna, \nKaali and several forms. He even reached the state of nirvikal=\r\npa \nsamadhi, where there is no &quot;experience&quot;. He was in sahaja samadhi \nalwa=\r\nys. He was able induce tremendous experience in people by mere \ntouch or me=\r\nre look. Yet he was simple like a child and had zero ego \n(that is why he c=\r\nould do all that!!!).\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Many &quot;gurus&quot; force their dharma on their si=\r\nshyas and have no \nability to recognize the true nature and dharma of each =\r\nsishya. They \nforce sishyas to chant the mantra they chant, worship the for=\r\nm they \nworship and walk the path they walk. Ramakrishna had deep insight \n=\r\ninto the true nature of each sishya and gave specific instructions. \nHe tau=\r\nght totally different mantras, totally different forms and \ntotally differe=\r\nnt paths to different sishyas. He even taught \ncontradictory things to diff=\r\nerent sishyas. When one sishya who \nneeded to mend his aggressive attitude =\r\nroughed up somebody for \ninsulting his guru, he scolded &quot;shame on you. With=\r\n your attitude, \nyou did not defend your guru, but brought shame to him. Yo=\r\nu should \nlearn to be calm and ignore such insults. THAT will place your gu=\r\nru \nin a good stead and not your aggression&quot;. When another sishya who \nneed=\r\ned to mend his soft demeanor ignored insults of Ramakrishna by \nsome people=\r\n and came away silently, he scolded him &quot;shame on you.\n&gt;  Shastras say that=\r\n you should kill one who insults your guru. How \ncan you ignore such wrong =\r\nbehavior? You should give them a piece of \nyour mind.&quot;\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Spiritual =\r\nsadhana does not mean just chanting a mantra or \nrepeating a procedure ever=\r\nyday for a certain period of time. \nSpiritual sadhana is a continuous proce=\r\nss by which one transforms \noneself from inside out and purifies oneself. T=\r\nhat way, every action \nand every thought becomes a sadhana and offers an op=\r\nportunity for \nintrospection and transformation of internal attitude.\n&gt;    =\r\n\n&gt;   Anyway, coming back to the point, Ramakrishna is not a normal \nsadhaka=\r\n or a normal guru. He belonged to a very special class of \nsadhakas and he =\r\nwas an exceptional guru to an exceptional group of \nsishyas.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   With=\r\nout his [indirect] blessings, I would be a nobody and would \nbe lower than =\r\ndirt. I would not be able to say anything intelligent \nor meaningful in spi=\r\nritual matters. Those who are impressed/inspired \nby something I write shou=\r\nld be thankful to my guru Dr Manish Pandit \nand to Sri Ramakrishna for show=\r\nering their grace using me as an \ninstrument and not to me.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   BTW, =\r\nyou are all free to forward my posts that you like to \npeople who may be in=\r\nterested in spiritual discussions.

It is dangerous to follow \nsomeone \n&gt; else&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Follo=\r\nwing the path of dharma basically means engaging in the right \n&gt; action/dut=\r\ny. Right action varies from person to person, from time \nto time \n&gt; and fro=\r\nm place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects \nfrom you, \n&gt; whic=\r\nh in turn is based on who you have been in the past, what \nactions you \n&gt; d=\r\nid in the past while identifying with the action, who you \naffected in the =\r\n\n&gt; past (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what \ndebts yo=\r\nu \n&gt; created in the process, and what mental tendencies you accumulated \nun=\r\ntil \n&gt; now.\n&gt; \n&gt; If, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nat=\r\nure \nwants a person \n&gt; to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If,=\r\n based on \none&#39;s mental \n&gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a pers=\r\non to spread the \nmessage of \n&gt; uniformity of all religions, that becomes o=\r\nne&#39;s dharma. If, based \non one&#39;s \n&gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nat=\r\nure wants a person to \nspread the \n&gt; ritual of homam in the world, that bec=\r\nomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based \non one&#39;s \n&gt; mental tendencies and karmic debt=\r\ns, nature wants a person to make \na lot of \n&gt; money and construct a temple,=\r\n that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The dharma of a being may chang=\r\ne from one life to another.\n&gt; \n&gt; At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arj=\r\nuna&#39;s dharma to kill his \ngurus, \n&gt; elders and relatives. The time then was=\r\n such that there was too \nmuch weight \n&gt; on earth and nature wanted earth t=\r\no be relieved of some weight. \nTremendous \n&gt; destruction was to take place =\r\nand civilization destroyed to a \ngreat extent, \n&gt; to welcome Kali yuga and =\r\nset the tone for it. Arjuna being a great \nwarrior, \n&gt; it was his dharma to=\r\n facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved \nand \n&gt; respected were on the=\r\n other side and it was his dharma to kill \nthem.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the same Arjuna =\r\nwas born again in the 19th century as one of \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s =\r\nsishyas (Swami Yogananda had been \nArjuna in a \n&gt; previous life, according =\r\nto Ramakrishna) , his dharma was \ndifferent in this \n&gt; new time and place. =\r\nHe was born to renounce material life despite \nhis \n&gt; aristocratic upbringi=\r\nng and live the simple life of a monk and \ninspire \n&gt; generations to embrac=\r\ne a simple life of mental detachment and \nservice to \n&gt; others. When he is =\r\nborn again (which he has to, as per what \nRamakrishna \n&gt; said), his dharma =\r\nbased on the time and place may be something \nelse.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The tri=\r\ncky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people=\r\n have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your \nown dharma \n&gt; and no=\r\nt someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though the \nconcept \n&gt; of=\r\n caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the \nconcept of =\r\n\n&gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived \nby \n=\r\n&gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. \nVishwamitra wa=\r\ns a \n&gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a \nmahar=\r\nshi \n&gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with \nth=\r\ne varna \n&gt; of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. =\r\nAs \none \n&gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one doe=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to \n=\r\nknow your \n&gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just =\r\n4 \ndharmas in \n&gt; the world. Each person has individual dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Knowing=\r\n what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one \nis pure \n&gt; enoug=\r\nh, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a \npart of our \n&gt; =\r\nmind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a \nlot of \n&gt;=\r\n noise from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, \nwe get=\r\n \n&gt; confused.\n&gt; \n&gt; We should make the best judgment combining discriminatio=\r\nn and \nintuition and \n&gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. =\r\nWe may be err, \nbut doing \n&gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; \n&gt; Mo=\r\nre than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to \nengage in \n&gt; =\r\nactions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are \nnot \n&gt; ac=\r\ncumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should \nnot build \n=\r\n&gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the \nbest \n=\r\n&gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in \nthe g=\r\niven \n&gt; situation is), with as little attachment and self-identification \nw=\r\nith the \n&gt; action as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave=\r\n \nthe result \n&gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen \n=\r\nnow&quot;, &quot;will it \n&gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unficat=\r\nion \nthrough \n&gt; untached action) will simplify our ego and purify our \ncons=\r\nciousness slowly. \n&gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tel=\r\nl our dharma \nclearer. \n&gt; There is a positive feedback here. This will slow=\r\nly enable us to \nsee our \n&gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incurring =\r\nnew karmas. This is \nnot easy, \n&gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, \none&#39;s sens=\r\ne of \n&gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in \nactio=\r\nn with \n&gt; little attachment.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;=\r\ns intellect and intuition are the \ninputs. \n&gt; Another external input is the=\r\n words of scriptures and learned men. \nOne can \n&gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from =\r\nthem. A special place is given to one&#39;s \nspiritual \n&gt; master. If one surren=\r\nders to a spiritual master, one can take the \nwords of \n&gt; the master to det=\r\nermine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Arjuna was confused =\r\nabout what his dharma was and thought \nkilling gurus \n&gt; and relatives was n=\r\not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who \nclarified his \n&gt; dharma. When Nare=\r\nndranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about \nhis dharma \n&gt; and wanted t=\r\no renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do \nsadhana, \n&gt; Ramakris=\r\nhna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in \nthe material \n&gt; wo=\r\nrld and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; \n&gt; One who is not in tune with nat=\r\nure and does not know who one is, \nwhat one&#39;s \n&gt; debts are and what nature =\r\nexpects from one can err in the judgment \nof what \n&gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If on=\r\ne&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear \ninsight into \n&gt; one&#39;s inner core=\r\n, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline is that=\r\n I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of \nprinciples and \n&gt; declare that as =\r\nthe dharma. No, dharma changes from person to \nperson, from \n&gt; time to time=\r\n and from place to place. Also, there are no \nthumbrules to find \n&gt; out wha=\r\nt one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding \nof one&#39;s \n&gt; dha=\r\nrma by increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of \nspiritual \n&gt; =\r\nsadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without \nmuch \n&gt; at=\r\ntachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s \nunderstanding of =\r\n\n&gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \ntarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yah=\r\noo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.=\r\norg\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.c=\r\no. in&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, September 2=\r\n7, 2008 8:02 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste to all\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; i just finished my Aghora series\n&gt; &gt; and in it in last part\n&gt; &gt; Vimalan=\r\nda says path of dharma is very personal.\n&gt; &gt; Can somebody share views on th=\r\nat and how can we approach\n&gt; &gt; towards it\n&gt; &gt; Does it has to do something w=\r\nith vedas and upanishads\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; jitender\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
