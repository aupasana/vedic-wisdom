It simply w=\r\norks well, and sometimes it even can explain things which other Dashas cann=\r\not explain that easily. \n&gt; \n&gt; But, I think, Antar Dashas are to be formed l=\r\nike in Varnada Dasha, or other Rashi Dashas: counting forwards for odd Rash=\r\nis, counting backwards for even Rashis.\n&gt; Could you please implement this?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Furthermore, I - and perhaps some other people - would be grateful if =\r\nin Shodshottari and Ashtottari Dasha there would be an option to start Anta=\r\nrdashas from the Mahadasha Lord.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you very much in advance!\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAll The Best!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
