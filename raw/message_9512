It has now\nascended to the level=\r\n of being prerequisite to become =91intellectual=92 and\nthe part of =91civi=\r\nl society=92. Being =91intellectual=92 means to swim upstream,\nto go agains=\r\nt the popular narrative, to take position that is against the\nfaith of comm=\r\non masses, to attack sentiments of people in the name of\nfreedom of express=\r\nion and openness. And this freedom is used very\nselectively by some media s=\r\ntalwarts. While questioning Hindu faith,\nexistence of Ram, mockery of Hanum=\r\nan- =91the monkey god=92, criticism of Ram\nfor Sita=92s Agnipariksha, quest=\r\nions on Krishna for having affairs with gopis\nand thousands of wives etc (a=\r\nll false allegations, rebutted on agniveer.com way\nback) make you an =91int=\r\nellectual=92 and a champion of freedom of expression,\nquestioning miracles,=\r\n prophets and their personal lives of Abrahamic\nreligions (minorities in In=\r\ndia) is highly communal and makes you fascist.\n\nWe recently came across a p=\r\niece of work titled as- *Ancient sex cultures in\nMahabharat, Rig Vedas and =\r\nreligious scriptures *published in Daily Bhaskar,\nkindly find it here\nhttp:=\r\n//daily.bhaskar.com/article/JM-ancient-sex-cultures-in-mahabharat-rig-vedas=\r\n-and-religious-scriptures-4265737-PHO.html.\nAuthor seems too intellectual t=\r\no give his name anywhere in the article.\nPost is full of innovations on sex=\r\nual relations and can put even\npornographic content to shame. For example, =\r\nthe author =91proves=92 from\nscriptures that, in ancient times, even mother=\r\n and son used to do sex.\nPeople used to enjoy animal sex. Anyone could do s=\r\nex with anyone anywhere,\neven in open when thousands others were watching.\n=\r\n\nPerverts were, are and will be there in society in all eras. *We don=92t\nb=\r\nother if one of them stands up one day and publishes stories of his\nexperie=\r\nnces and fantasies in newspapers. But what bothers us is the attempt\nby a p=\r\nervert to justify his own shameful acts by dragging in religion and\nholy te=\r\nxts of Hinduism.*\n\nThis article seems to be a way to promote pornography an=\r\nd use denigration\nof noble Hindu culture as a ploy to increase hits, confus=\r\ne devout Hindus,\ncreate hatred for Hindus in minds of non-Hindus and in pro=\r\ncess, further\ntheir own selfish goals. After all what is more welcoming to =\r\na media house\nthan something that brings controversial popularity. Sex bein=\r\ng considered\nthe strongest drive among materially inclined humans, and reli=\r\ngion being\nstrongest influence on typical majority of Indians, there can be=\r\n no better\nformula for publicity than linking the two. Anyway, here is the =\r\npoint wise\nresponse\n\n*Author:* *There was a stage in our history, when ther=\r\ne were no social\nrules formed for sex between men and women. That was the t=\r\nime when no one\nwould care about the relationship they share with other hum=\r\nan beings before\nhaving sex with them. This is because there were no such r=\r\nelationships back\nthen.*\n\n*Having sex with any woman, having open sex anywh=\r\nere anytime like animals,\nhaving sex with young girls and even sex with ani=\r\nmals was a common thing\nwith humans. Sex was wayward that time.*\n\n*With the=\r\n development of civilization, relationships, social practices and\nethical s=\r\ntandards developed. We can understand it in historical\nsociological context=\r\n.*\n\n*To know how sex was an integral part of our society, click on this sli=\r\nde\nshow=85*\n\n*Agniveer:*\n\nNo one knows how the author jumped to these concl=\r\nusions. These are just\nclaims made by author. The author does not even stat=\r\ne which era of history\nis he talking about. As we will see in next slides (=\r\nwith vulgar images put\nfor obvious reasons), he is inclined to give sexual =\r\ncolors to anything\nHindu irrespective of how far or near to present it is. =\r\nAs we will also\nsee, these claims are based on most silly and unverified =\r\n=91facts=92 known best\nto the authors.\n\nThere have always been criminals an=\r\nd perverts and even sex-maniacs like the\ncurrent author in all eras of civi=\r\nlization. *If someone reads author=92s post\nin Daily Bhaskar and looks at r=\r\night hand side, there are links to\npictures/news (screenshot attached) of s=\r\nemi nude prostitutes. So according\nto author, Daily Bhaskar is all about pr=\r\nostitutes and their whereabouts!*\n\n*If someone reads about the recent ghast=\r\nly Delhi Gangrape case and\nconcludes that =93Once upon a time, raping women=\r\n and killing them was a\ncommon thing with humans. Rape was wayward that tim=\r\ne. Rape was an integral\npart of our society.=94, what would you call that p=\r\nerson. Either too dumb or\ntoo perverted! If there is a third option, let us=\r\n know.*\n\n*Author:* *In chapter 63 of Adiparva in Mahabharat, open sex betwe=\r\nen Rishi\nParashar and Satyavati Matsyangandha has been described. Also, in =\r\nthe 104th\nchapter of Adiparva, it is mentioned that son of Utthat, Dirghtam=\r\na started\nhaving sex with a woman in front of all the people.*\n\n*Agniveer:*=\r\n\n\n1. Firstly, the context of Rishi Parashar issue has been misquoted. Autho=\r\nr\nhas lied blatantly because *the verses clearly state that there was\ncompl=\r\nete isolation, there was none around.* On top of it, whether one\nendorses i=\r\nt or not is left to individual=92s analysis. Further, the\nconditions and si=\r\ntuations of the story are unknown. Even more, whether the\nverses are fully =\r\nauthentic is also a question mark. Because the same\nMahabharat says in Aadi=\r\n Parva, Chapter 1, verses 81, 101 and 102 that the\noriginal Mahabharat cons=\r\nisted of only 8800 verses which was expanded to the\none with 24000 verses f=\r\nirst and later it became the book with more than\n1,00,000 verses. It is com=\r\nmon with all history books.\n\n2. We don=92t know what made author bring stor=\r\nies of an almost unknown person\nand then prove that Mahabharat sanctions ad=\r\nultery, that too, in open. He\ncould not give any Shloka in his support. Now=\r\n see this! Here is the same\nDirghtama, son of Utthat in the same chapter 10=\r\n4 in Adi Parva saying- *it\nis not lawful for a woman to have connection wit=\r\nh a man other than her\nhusband. And she who may have such connection shall =\r\ncertainly be regarded\nas fallen=85*\n\nHere, *Dirghtama unequivocally states =\r\nadultery as sin*. Now even if he\npracticed it in the verses best known to a=\r\nuthor, it is his moral weakness\nand not a principle of Mahabharat! But thes=\r\ne verses being contrary to what\nthe author was searching (pornography) in h=\r\nighly titillated state were\nignored completely by the author.\n\n3. Author is=\r\n hell bent in proving that in Mahabharat and ancient times,\nthere were no r=\r\nules for sex. Anyone could be with anyone anywhere for this\npurpose. Sex wa=\r\ns wayward=85 Author could not give a single proof of what he\nclaimed. But h=\r\nere are some examples that prove otherwise-\n\na. Man who is respected most i=\r\nn Mahabharat after Shri Krishna is Bhishma.\nDo you know why, Mr/Ms/=85 Auth=\r\nor? *Because he was a Brahmchari, a celibate,\nwho was respected by Rishis a=\r\nnd masses for his self control. His vow-\nBhishma Pratigya- of being Brahmch=\r\nari is considered as the greatest resolve\nin Mahabharat and even till today=\r\n.* This indicates that whatever the\nbehaviour and conduct of common masses =\r\nbe, self control was always\nconsidered as the greatest virtue in ancient Hi=\r\nndu history.\n\nb. Mr/Ms/=85 Author! Bhagwad Geeta is the most popular litera=\r\nture known to\nmankind on spirituality and self/mind control. =93Be master o=\r\nf senses, not\nslave=94 remains the core essence of Geeta. And coincidently,=\r\n *Geeta is the\npart of Mahabharat- Bhishma Parva, same Mahabharat that, acc=\r\nording to\nauthor, taught author=92s ancestors to do sex with anyone anywher=\r\ne!   *\n\nc. Mr/Ms/=85 Author says that there were no relations in the time o=\r\nf\nMahabharat and anyone could =85. anytime anywhere with anyone, even in fr=\r\nont\nof everyone. But we all know the reality. Author does not know that *Ar=\r\njun\nwent to a self imposed exile for few years during Vanvaas of Pandavas. =\r\nWhy?\nBecause of the sin he committed. What sin? Sin of entering the room of=\r\n\nYudhishthir and Draupadi when they were discussing some matters alone! And=\r\n\nsince Arjun thought that he has violated privacy of the two, he went to\nex=\r\nile of few years!* Leave alone sex, standards of morality were so high in\nt=\r\nhose times that Arjun considered it sin to even listen to the discussion\nof=\r\n a couple. But the shameless Author found pornography in Mahabharat!\n\nd. In=\r\n Mahabharat, no relations would matter in those times, sex culture was\nall =\r\npervading, says the author. But reality was diametrically opposite. *When\nt=\r\nhe king of Matsya Desh gave marriage proposal of his daughter Uttara to\nArj=\r\nun, Arjun denied forcefully and said that how can he marry Uttara, his\ndisc=\r\niple whom he has always considered as his own daughter? Arjun, then,\nhad Ut=\r\ntara married to his son Abhimanyu!  *\n\ne. People used to=85. anywhere with =\r\nanyone, says the author. But he forgets\nwhy whole Mahabharat took place in =\r\nfirst place! Foundations of Mahabharat\nwar were laid down the day Duhshasan=\r\n dragged Draupadi in the court and\ntried to do what author foolishly believ=\r\nes was a custom in those days. Had\nit been a custom in those days to=85. wi=\r\nth anyone, anywhere, there would be\nno Mahabharat in first place!\n\n*Author:=\r\n* *In modern history, it is described that Maharaja Ranjit Singh\nused to ha=\r\nve sex in a place where his elephant used to be tied for everyone\nto see hi=\r\nm. In the times of Bajirav, a game =91Ghatkancuki=92 used to play in\nPune.*=\r\n\n\n*Also, some chosen elite men and women were made to have sex for others\ne=\r\nntertainment. The men used to first pull the women=92s dresses and then hav=\r\ne\nsex with them in public. The sexual game would continue until every man\nw=\r\nould have slept with every woman. *\n\n*Agniveer:* Hatred of author for Hindu=\r\ns-Sikhs is now exposed. He/she\nstarted with ancient history and Mahabharat =\r\nand suddenly jumped to Maharaja\nRanjit Singh whom most of Hindus and Sikhs =\r\nlove so much. And there is no\nauthentic reference to this claim is given by=\r\n author.  And this time\nexample is from Modern History. But author himself =\r\nstated that*=93*With the\ndevelopment of civilization, relationships, social=\r\n practices and ethical\nstandards developed. =94 Does it mean that these dev=\r\nelopments happened only\nin last 100 years?\n\nIt is clear that fake reference=\r\ns from equally dubious sources are being\nused to impose sexual perversion o=\r\nf the author on the Hindu culture. *Even\nif the author is able to prove tha=\r\nt in history, some X, Y or Z persons used\nto do A,B or C, that no way prove=\r\ns that A, B or C was commonplace and\nendorsed by religious norms. In matter=\r\ns of Hinduism, the norm is Vedas.\nUnless something is proven there, it has =\r\nno significance. *\n\n*Author:* *In Karnataka, until independence, people use=\r\nd to organize group\nsex. Here, age was not a concern at all. It is believed=\r\n that in ancient\ntimes, Tamilians too used to have sex in front of everyone=\r\n. One can find in\nVedas that people used to have open group sex in yagya bh=\r\noomi.*\n\n*Agniveer:*\n\na. Who in Karnataka and Tamil Nadu? *In USA, many peop=\r\nle are in asylums. In\nPakistan, many are throwing bombs. In Delhi, many rap=\r\nes are happening. What\ndoes that imply? That mental diseases are common in =\r\nUSA? That all\nPakistanis are terrorists as a rule? That most Delhites are r=\r\napists? *\n\nb. In last line, reference to Vedas are given. Kindly provide wh=\r\nich verse\nin Vedas state so and what is the evidence that your translation =\r\nis\ncorrect? On contrary we can provide innumerable examples from Vedas that=\r\n\nextol that women should be respected as mother, self-control be followed,\n=\r\nmonogamy be way of family, and sex etc be private matters not to be done in=\r\n\npublic. Here are few Mantras from Vedas that expose author=92s lies\n\n*- In=\r\n Atharva Veda 7.38.4, wife says that =93You should only be mine. You\nshould=\r\n not even discuss about other women.=94*\n\n*- Atharva Ved 3.30.2 and 14.2.64=\r\n appeal husband and wife to be devoted and\nfaithful to each other.*\n\n*- Rig=\r\n Veda 10.105.8 compares existence of multiple partners with multiple\nworldl=\r\ny miseries.*\n\n*- Rig Veda 10.101.11 states that a person with two partners =\r\nis pressed\nfrom both sides and weeps like a horse that neighs when pressed =\r\nfrom both\nsides by spokes while driving a chariot.*\n\n*- Rig Veda 10.101.11 =\r\nstate that two partners make life aimless.*\n\n*- Atharva Veda 3.18.2 prays t=\r\nhat may a woman never face threat of another\nco-wife.*\n\nAuthor is suggested=\r\n to stop searching for porn in religious texts. He may\ndo it better elsewhe=\r\nre. And yes, if he/she/=85 wants to know real meanings\nand importance of Ve=\r\ndas, Agniveer is ready to offer authentic translations\nwhich can be ordered=\r\n from our Vedic store- Agnikart!\n\n*Author:* *Kautbik sex (incest) is mentio=\r\nned in ancient texts. It is\nmentioned =91Harivansh=92 that the daughter of =\r\nsage Vasishta, Shatrupa believed\nhim to be her husband and therefore used t=\r\no have sex with him. In the same\ngrantha it is mentioned that Daksha gave h=\r\ner daughter to his father,\nBrahmadev and Narada was born.*\n\n*As mentioned i=\r\nn Haribhavishya, Indra dev had sex with his great grandson=92s\n(Janmejay) w=\r\nife Vapushtma. *\n\n*Agniveer:*\n\n*What is Harivansh? Which chapter and page o=\r\nf which book? What is\nHaribhavishya? The author does not even know names of=\r\n books he is quoting.\nNo such books exist in Hindu library.*\n\n*Author:* *In=\r\n Mahabharat=92s Adiparva, it is said that if an unmarried woman\nexpresses h=\r\ner desire to have sex, it should be fulfilled. If her wish is\nnot fulfilled=\r\n, it means death of religion. Ulupi clearly says to Arjuna\nthat to satisfy =\r\na woman, it not against religion to sleep with her for one\nnight.*\n\n*Agnive=\r\ner:*\n\n*Who is saying to whom in Mahabharat? Is it Lord Krishna saying in Ge=\r\neta?\nOr Rishi Ved Vyas talking to author?* Mahabharat even has characters l=\r\nike\nDuryodhan who said that women were his slaves. Does it mean that Mahabh=\r\narat\nconsiders women as slaves? Just think of it. Author is referring to Ul=\r\nupi.\nWas Ulupi a sage to be able to state what is right and wrong? On contr=\r\nary,\nauthor is referring to a woman who is mad in love and hence has her se=\r\nnses\nblurred to decide what is right or wrong.\n\nIf Dharma-Adharma were so c=\r\nlearly understood in Mahabharat era, how would\none explain role of Lord Kri=\r\nshna. Millions regard him as an incarnation to\nprotect and establish Dharma=\r\n. If everyone was so Dharmic, why would Krishna\nhave been an incarnation.\n\n=\r\n*Further, if free sex was so commonplace even in that era, why Arjun\nrefuse=\r\nd her wish? Why would Ulupi had to justify her stand?* She would have\ndone =\r\nwhat she wanted to do without even mentioning a word and forgetting it\nlate=\r\nr. Further, it should also be known that Ulupi belonged to current\nMexico r=\r\negion and not Bharatvarsha. Different societies have different\ncultural nor=\r\nms over different periods of time. History books would only\ntell you about =\r\npeople. For principles, one needs knowledge books like Vedas.\n\n*Author:* *W=\r\nhen Urvashi told Arjuna that if the Paurva Vansh=92a any son or\ngrandson wa=\r\nnts to have sex with any woman of her family including her, it\nis not insul=\r\nting religion. However, Arjuna did not accept it and Urvashi\ncalled him imp=\r\notent.*\n\n*It is also mentioned in religious scriptures that sage Agastya ha=\r\nd kept\nhis daughter with the King of Vidarbha and when she reached age of\nm=\r\narriage, he married his own daughter. *\n\n*Agniveer:* Again is Urvashi a sag=\r\ne? She was supposed to be a dancing girl.\nAnd this story proves exactly opp=\r\nosite to what author=92s pervert mind wants\nto infer. *Arjun refused Urvash=\r\ni=92s wish!* *This example is quoted in\nMahabharat to showcase what ideal r=\r\neligion is =96 to consider women as mother\nirrespective of her status and p=\r\nrofession =96 the way Arjun did. Even when\nUrvashi insulted Arjuna, he did =\r\nnot deter from his stand.*\n\n*Arjuna stood to his stand of respect for women=\r\n. He had to face curse of\nUrvashi for this. But even then, he turned this c=\r\nurse into an opportunity.\nThus, message is that under whatsoever pressure, =\r\none must respect women.\nAnd even if one has to face problems due to that, i=\r\nt will turn into\nopportunity.*\n\nWhich religious scripture is second story f=\r\nrom, is unknown. For Hindus, the\nonly reliable texts are Vedas. Everything =\r\nelse is to be understood,\ninterpreted and accepted in lines of Vedas. There=\r\n is a mix of facts and\nallegories in Hindu texts. They are not to be taken =\r\nliterally. The\nlanguage, era and society keep changing from time to time. B=\r\nut what is\nimportant is that they all point to noble tenets of Vedas as elu=\r\ncidated in\ntexts like Gita and Ishopanishad.\n\n*Author:* *In the tenth manda=\r\nl of Rig Veda, the sexual conversation between\nYam and Yami is mentioned. H=\r\nere, Yami expresses her desire to have sex with\nher own brother. When Yam r=\r\nefuses to do so, she insists and says that a\nsister remaining unsatisfied d=\r\nespite her brother being around, so what is\nher brother=92s use? *\n\n*This c=\r\nlearly signifies the sexual relationship between brothers and\nsisters in an=\r\ncient times.*\n\n*Agniveer:*\n\na. Firstly, Yam Yami is a deep concept referrin=\r\ng to certain fundamental\nprinciples of nature applicable in all situations.=\r\n Basically they say that\ncomplementary entities emerging from same source m=\r\nust not complement each\nother and instead seek to spread in world. For exam=\r\nple, if I have a shop\nselling orange juice at Rs 10 and my brother has a sh=\r\nop selling mango juice\nat Rs 10, we should not buy and sell from each other=\r\n. In that case, each\nday we can keep drinking glasses of juice from each ot=\r\nher and transfer only\nRs 10!\n\nThis moral has been put in allegorical langua=\r\nge in this sukta. The essence\nis that regardless of whatsoever pressure, on=\r\ne must respect and protect\ndignity of entities coming from same source with=\r\nout using them for personal\ngains. What this sukta signifies is that relati=\r\nonships between such\nentities (that also includes brother and sister) is st=\r\nrictly prohibited as\nper Vedas =96 oldest text and foundation of Hinduism. =\r\nThe beauty of Hinduism\nis that it does not impose blanket rules. Instead it=\r\n provides logical\nintuitive reasons =96 the why =96 so that instead of bein=\r\ng blind followers,\neach of us becomes an enlightened master. This is what t=\r\nhis sukta aims. But\nperverts only see vulgarity is purest of things.\n\nb. Ev=\r\nen if this Sukta be considered as discussion of brother and sister, *a\nBIG =\r\nNO from brother concludes it all* and establishes the rule that such\nrelati=\r\nonships are not acceptable!\n\n*Author:* *About sexual relations, ancient his=\r\ntorian Cipeve Lerhuno wrote\nthat people used to occasionally have sex with =\r\ntheir mothers, sisters and\ndaughters.*\n\n*Agniveer:*\n\na. *Did this historian=\r\n mention Hinduism ever? It is quite possible that he\nmight have written abo=\r\nut his own family or society and the author has\nsuperimposed his confession=\r\ns on Hinduism for ulterior motives. *\n\nb. Who is this historian? We request=\r\n everyone to google this name and see\nwhat comes!\n\nc. Anyway, why should we=\r\n care about him? How is his word a gospel for us?\nMaybe the author is tryin=\r\ng to defend some sins he may have committed in a\nfreudian manner. Nothing e=\r\nlse explains such baseless reference less, vulgar\nallegations on Hinduism.\n=\r\n\nd. And now author writes- =91occasionally=92 which denies it to be a custo=\r\nm\nwhich is contrary to what he/she/=85 wrote in previous slides that *anyon=\r\ne\ncould do anything to anyone* like animals, there were no relationships at=\r\n\nall!\n\n*Author:* *Mahabharta mentiones in Adiparva that having sex with any=\r\n women\nis not bad and is a normal behavior. Relationships are names given t=\r\no know\npeople.*\n\n*Agniveer:*\n\nWho said to whom and in what context? Just bl=\r\nanket claim. *I may say that\nAuthor mentioned in 2010 that he was a psychop=\r\nath and should be thrashed\nwhenever he denigrates Hinduism.* Should we take=\r\n my statement as seriously\nas author wants us to take his vulgar allegation=\r\ns? Anyway, enough has been\ndiscussed on Mahabharat above.\n\n*Author:* *Duryo=\r\ndhan had made Karna the king of Angdesh. In this desh,\nwoman and children w=\r\nere sold.*\n\n*Agniveer:*\n\na. Any reference? And *neither Duryodhan nor Karna=\r\n was supposed to be a\nsage. In fact Duryodhan was considered the main villa=\r\nin of Mahabharat. If\nAjmal Kasab wanted to kill Indians, that does not make=\r\n all people in\nindian-subcontinent terrorists*.\n\nb. If this is true, then t=\r\nhis would be another reason why Mahabharat\nhappened. *So say thanks to nobl=\r\ne characters in Mahabharat for fighting\nagainst slavery instead of proving =\r\nthem and society guilty of same!*\n\n*Author:* *Clearly, regulation of sexual=\r\n relations came into our society\nsequentially with the development of civil=\r\nization and culture. However, the\nprimitive desire to have sex from time to=\r\n time in humans is strengthened.\nThat is why even today we hear about such =\r\nsexual relations, which are\nillegal and immoral. Such relations are wrong t=\r\no a civilized man, but it is\nalso true that sex is a primitive instinct. *\n=\r\n\n*Agniveer:*\n\nNo denying the fact that sex is a primitive instinct. That is=\r\n why Hindu\nDharma aims to reform primitive savages into sensible humans who=\r\n realize\npurpose of their actions and act responsibly to maximize bliss for=\r\n entire\nworld.\n\n*Questions for author*\n\n- Why were only Hinduism and Sikhis=\r\nm targeted in the name of history? What\nabout other religions that have a f=\r\nar wider spread and a more thoroughly\ndocumented history in modern and midd=\r\nle era?\n\n- Author hurled abuses on Hindu scriptures like Vedas and Mahabhar=\r\nat and\nrole models like Arjun and Maharaja Ranjit Singh without a single\nre=\r\nference. Why single out Hinduism and Sikhism for this affection? Why no\nana=\r\nlysis on other religions? Does it not amount to religious fundamentalism\nto=\r\n target one single religion =96 the religion of majority =96 in a secular\nc=\r\nountry and allow no space for other religions?\n\nDo you think attacking Hind=\r\nuism in India is nice job to do since Hinduism\nneither has apostates nor in=\r\nfidels nor blasphemy laws? Does all this not\nsmell of bias and hatred again=\r\nst Hinduism?\n\nPlease note that we do not intend to target any religion. We =\r\nrespect all\nindividuals and their freedom to choose and respect whatever fa=\r\nith they\nprefer for themselves.\n\nAfter all, Hinduism, by its very nature, i=\r\ns a forgiving and tolerant faith\nopen to harshest criticism.\n\nBut be brave =\r\nnot coward. Respect the culture that gives you freedom. Love\nit like Mother=\r\n.\n\nMay the truth prevail!\n\nPS: Hindu Janajagruti Samiti has decided to take=\r\n up this issue.

Further, the conditions and situations of the story are unkn=\r\nown. Even more, whether the verses are fully authentic is also a question m=\r\nark. Because the same Mahabharat says in Aadi Parva, Chapter 1, verses 81, =\r\n101 and 102 that the original Mahabharat consisted of only 8800 verses whic=\r\nh was expanded to the one with 24000 verses first and later it became the b=\r\nook with more than 1,00,000 verses.

We don=92t know what made author bring stories of an al=\r\nmost unknown person and then prove that Mahabharat sanctions adultery, that=\r\n too, in open. He could not give any Shloka in his support. Now see this! H=\r\nere is the same Dirghtama, son of Utthat in the same chapter 104 in Adi Par=\r\nva saying-=A0&lt;b&gt;it is not lawful for a woman to have connection with a man =\r\nother than her husband.

Firstly, Yam Yami is a deep concept referring to certain=\r\n fundamental principles of nature applicable in all situations. Basically t=\r\nhey say that complementary entities emerging from same source must not comp=\r\nlement each other and instead seek to spread in world. For example, if I ha=\r\nve a shop selling orange juice at Rs 10 and my brother has a shop selling m=\r\nango juice at Rs 10, we should not buy and sell from each other. In that ca=\r\nse, each day we can keep drinking glasses of juice from each other and tran=\r\nsfer only Rs 10!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=3D&quot;font:14px/22px &quot;Open Sans&quot;,Verda=\r\nna,Arial,Helvetica,Tahoma,sans-serif;margin:0px;padding:0px 0px 25px;color:=\r\nrgb(51,51,51);text-transform:none;text-indent:0px;letter-spacing:normal;wor=\r\nd-spacing:0px;white-space:normal;font-size-adjust:none;font-stretch:normal;=\r\nbackground-color:rgb(255,255,255)&quot;&gt;\nThis moral has been put in allegorical =\r\nlanguage in this sukta. The essence is that regardless of whatsoever pressu=\r\nre, one must respect and protect dignity of entities coming from same sourc=\r\ne without using them for personal gains. What this sukta signifies is that =\r\nrelationships between such entities (that also includes brother and sister)=\r\n is strictly prohibited as per Vedas =96 oldest text and foundation of Hind=\r\nuism. The beauty of Hinduism is that it does not impose blanket rules. Inst=\r\nead it provides logical intuitive reasons =96 the why =96 so that instead o=\r\nf being blind followers, each of us becomes an enlightened master. This is =\r\nwhat this sukta aims.
