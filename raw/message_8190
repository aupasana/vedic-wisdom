Since she has no experience she will need help so I was wo=\r\nndering can I take a metallic spoon or something to help the fire from goin=\r\ng out? Any tips how can I help?\n\n\nAnother question that arises in my mind i=\r\ns, is it too early for me to teach homam.  Homam requires one to be brahmac=\r\nhari. Due to hormonal issues teens start experiencing sexual thoughts and v=\r\naried emotions. Having a kid control her emotions at such an early age is i=\r\nt really right on my part? Will I be putting pressure on them .....shouldn&#39;=\r\nt they experience the life in fullest form before endeavouring the path of =\r\nspirituality.  \n\n\nExperienced parents kindly advice me? \n\n\nAdvance thanks f=\r\nor every help,\n\n\nRegards,\n\nPriya\n\n\n"}}
