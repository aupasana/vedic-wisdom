Read the mantra add Om Swaahaa at the end and offer ahut=\r\ni. There is no problem with this normally.\n\nHow ever, looking at your speci=\r\nfic question, I am not sure, most of us could answer.\n\nYour question raises=\r\n few doubts on your intent. If your wife is destroying every thing in your =\r\nlife, what is that you want to achieve by offering some additional mantras =\r\nin homam. In some corner of your mind, do you wish to destroy her so that s=\r\nhe can no longer destroy. If such a thought is present even at a minute lev=\r\nel, I suggest you not to do any thing. As Narasimha pointed out any the art=\r\n of using homam for material benefit is almost exinct.\n\nIf you want to do t=\r\nhis so that your wife&#39;s mental state improves, then your intent is satwik i=\r\nn nature and you can offer any mantra for that.\n\nYou may mental think of yo=\r\nur wifes well being and offer mRtyunjaya mantra along with black sesame see=\r\nds. (Or any other mantra).\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;biswa108&quot; &lt;biswa1975@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; NAMASKAR\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Rajarshi=\r\n,\n&gt; \n&gt; The procedure you taught proves that the homam procedure could be ch=\r\nange according to ones needs, it maybe restricted beyond limit...Now, I wan=\r\nt to ask you a follow-up question, whether I could add some extra part (man=\r\ntra/ahuti/poornahuti/material used/different deities/or anything) to the ma=\r\nin homam procedure to get relief in troubles created by my psychic wife!
