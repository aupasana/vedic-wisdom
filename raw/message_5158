It is a nice group as =\r\nI already noted in my first post.  Most importantly it is always a joy to i=\r\nnteract with you.\n      \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Traditional &gt;&gt;&gt;conventions are not without b=\r\nasis, but I suggest &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;we need to understand their &gt;&gt;&gt;motivation.\n\nBoth of=\r\n us share a similar approach here. As I already wrote in an earlier post, &quot;=\r\nthere will be varied beliefs and opinions ranging from the very rigid tradi=\r\ntional extreme to the very liberal and casual new-age extreme based on one&#39;=\r\ns personal affiliations, family and cultural influences&quot;.   Neither of us i=\r\ns at the liberal/casual extreme nor the very rigid traditional extreme. Bot=\r\nh of us seem to be somewhere in the middle though at different points.   \n =\r\n \n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;If one reaches samadhi directly when Kundalini awakens, things &gt;&gt;&gt;a=\r\nre fine. But, that may not &gt;&gt;happen. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kundalini can take many different =\r\npaths and go to different places. Depending on the &gt;&gt;&gt;impurities in various=\r\n nadis, various experiences are possible. If a sadhaka is unprepared to han=\r\ndle &gt;&gt;&gt;the experience, it can create &gt;&gt;&gt;problems. One can experience someth=\r\ning nice and become proud and &gt;&gt;&gt;egoistic and get stuck there. One can expe=\r\nrience a very fierce form of divine and get scared to death &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or go mad. =\r\nMany &gt;&gt;&gt;possibilities are there.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n\nExcellent point. Here I will share s=\r\nomething from my own experience to illustrate this. Initially I was hesitan=\r\nt to write about it, but decided to go ahead as it might help put things in=\r\n a better perspective. During 1989-1992, I pursued sadhana single-mindedly =\r\nas a brahmachari, having given up other secular studies. Those days I used =\r\nto live mostly in the company of brahmacharis and sanyasis. Some of my co-s=\r\nadhakas of those days went on to become fully ordained monks later. Swadhya=\r\nya, yogabhyasa and occasional tirthayatras formed the mainstay of my sadhan=\r\na at this time. Somewhere towards the second half of this period I started =\r\ndoing Devi Mahatmya parayana on my own without any initiation. Things were =\r\nfine and I made some progress probably owing to a combination of many facto=\r\nrs. After spending three years in spiritual studies and sadhana, I decided =\r\nto return home and pursue medical studies in accordance with my mother&#39;s wi=\r\nsh. However I continued with my sadhana whilst pursuing my medical studies =\r\ntoo.\n\nAround early 95, I started doing Devi Mahatmya parayana with *more* v=\r\nigour. Within a month I started having piercing headaches, my body would be=\r\n quite hot to touch and my blood pressure would shoot up to around 150/110 =\r\non and off. After conducting the standard investigations, Dr. Rao from the =\r\nDept of Medicine, who had already taken a liking to me, suspected that it *=\r\nmight* have something to do with my sadhanas too. Things continued to be th=\r\ne same for some more months, till I got introduced to Swami Sachchidananda =\r\nin what seemed to be a chance meeting. During the course of conversation Sw=\r\namiji asked me to meet him alone the next day after coming to know about my=\r\n practice of the Devi mahatmya parayana. After interacting everyday for a w=\r\neek Swamiji initiated me properly into Sri Sri Chandi path.  After a week o=\r\nr so after the initiation all the symptoms subsided. The blood pressure, jw=\r\nara and headaches, all normalized. It has been around 15 years since then a=\r\nnd none of the symptoms have recurred. What&#39;s more, I had some very powerfu=\r\nl internal experiences in quick succession during the following week itself=\r\n after initiation. This is my experience.\n                                 =\r\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;(6) If one is not looking for any specific results and doing a &gt;&gt;&gt;mant=\r\nra just for spiritual progress with a &gt;&gt;&gt;sense of surrender, one is safe.&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n\n\nRight from the start whatever sadhanas I did, were all done largely as=\r\n a spiritual pursuit only with no specific results in mind at least conscio=\r\nusly. However the general desire to make progress would have naturally been=\r\n there.\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt; (5) Especially if one does not engage in raja yoga/hatha yoga=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt;practices that are meant to forcefully &gt;&gt;&gt;awaken and raise Kundalini &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;and if one does not consciously think in terms of &gt;&gt;&gt;raising Kundalini, on=\r\ne is &gt;&gt;&gt;safe.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n\nThough I was not consciously thinking of raising Kundal=\r\nni or anything like that and was just focusing on sadhana, you are right ab=\r\nout the raja yoga/hatha yoga practices. Yogabhyasa was a regular part of my=\r\n sadhana during 89-92. In fact I became a qualified Yogacharya during this =\r\ntime. However Devi Mahatmya parayana was part of my sadhana along with yoga=\r\nbhyasa since early 91-92 during which time things were fine. It was only in=\r\n 94 that I resumed Devi Mahatmya parayana more seriously. Of course I was d=\r\noing my yogabhyasa too at this time. I have already written about the rest.=\r\n  \n\nMy stance regarding the role of initiation stems from my own experience=\r\n as well as the instructions coming down through the guru parampara. Howeve=\r\nr I can appreciate your stance as well. Let me add something more here. No =\r\ntwo individuals have the same experience in such matters. Some may experien=\r\nce nothing significant after initiation and may still be progressing. Some =\r\nmay need more guidance due to the nature of the specific practices that the=\r\ny have got into. Eitherways She will take care.  \n\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Given this state=\r\nment, the difference of opinion between us are very subtle.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n\nIt is bet=\r\nter for all of us to focus more on the underlying unity of our thought and =\r\nnot on the difference. Moreover overstretching such discussions can deter s=\r\nome sadhakas which is not something that anyone of us would wish for.\n \n\n &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; One word on guilt here. If someone is doing a practice and feels a sens=\r\ne of guilt, it blocks the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;practice from working &gt;&gt;&gt;effectively. Please =\r\ndo whatever sadhana you do, without a sense of guilt. If &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you have the s=\r\nense of guilt, work on overcoming it. If &gt;&gt;&gt;you cannot overcome it, it may =\r\nbe a good &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;idea to find a &gt;&gt;&gt;sadhana with which you feel comfortable and=\r\n have no sense of guilt.&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n\nI agree that there are many good sadhakas doi=\r\nng Sri Sri Chandipath without initiation. There is no need for anyone to fe=\r\nel guilty. It is only good samskaras and vasanas that attract a sadhaka to =\r\nSri Sri Chandi. One does not need to feel guilty for worshipping or loving =\r\nthe Goddess.  If you take my own example, initially I did the sadhana witho=\r\nut initiation. It is only Her Grace that I was initiated. I didn&#39;t even ask=\r\n for it. If it is meant to be it will be. Things will happen on their own a=\r\nccord in the natural flow. The main thing is that the sadhaka should leave =\r\nthe rest to the compassionate Goddess and trust that She will take care of =\r\neverything.                   \n\nOn this note I suggest that we should wrap =\r\nup the topic of initiation. From my side I wish to say nothing more. \n\nI mi=\r\nght be off the list till another fortnight or so as I am travelling.\n    \n\n=\r\nAll Glories to the Goddess!!!\n\nRegards,\nSatya Prakash   \n\n\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasi=\r\nmha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Satya Prakash garu,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Welcome =\r\nto the list and it is a pleasure to have your learned company here.\n&gt;  \n&gt; T=\r\nraditional conventions are not without basis, but I suggest we need to unde=\r\nrstand their motivation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; When one chants lo=\r\nng prayers such as Chandipath, Vishnu sahasra naama stotra, Aditya Hridayam=\r\n etc, it requires a lot of conscious mental activity. One mostly cannot go =\r\ninto samadhi while chanting them (though there can be exceptions). On the o=\r\nther hand, when one chants Gayatri mantra or ashtakshari mantra or dwadasak=\r\nshari mantra or panchakshari mantra or navarna mantra or various beeja mant=\r\nras or other small mantras, it requires a minimal amount of conscious menta=\r\nl activity. With repetitive and minimal mental activity, there is a possibi=\r\nlity of momentary cessation of mental activity and entering samadhi OR awak=\r\nening of Kundalini and progress towards samadhi.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one reaches samad=\r\nhi directly when Kundalini awakens, things are fine. But, that may not happ=\r\nen. Kundalini can take many different paths and go to different places. Dep=\r\nending on the impurities in various nadis, various experiences are possible=\r\n. If a sadhaka is unprepared to handle the experience, it can create proble=\r\nms. One can experience something nice and become proud and egoistic and get=\r\n stuck there. One can experience a very fierce form of divine and get scare=\r\nd to death or go mad. Many possibilities are there.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thus, practices t=\r\nhat can truly awaken one were kept limited to the initiated. Guru would ass=\r\ness the progress and readiness of a sadhaka and initiate one when one is re=\r\nady.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, there are a few things that a=\r\nre different in today&#39;s times:\n&gt;  \n&gt; (1) There are very few people who are =\r\nready to experience something. Most people will just do sadhana, burn some =\r\nbasic blocking karmas and not really experience much. At most, some people =\r\nwill experience an awakening and just a little movement of Kundalini.\n&gt; (2)=\r\n There are very few gurus who are indeed capable of assessing and guiding a=\r\n sadhaka well. Most initiations are a mere formality.\n&gt; (3) With the insist=\r\nence on initiation etc, we may be blocking, in the coming years, the very f=\r\new sadhakas who MAY actually achieve some progress with a mantra, from even=\r\n trying it.\n&gt; (4) If a sadhaka surrenders and has the attitude of &quot;I do not=\r\n know the right way. I am just doing what I am capable of. Please take care=\r\n of me Mother&quot;, none of the risks I mentioned above will really apply.\n&gt; (5=\r\n) Especially if one does not engage in raja yoga/hatha yoga practices that =\r\nare meant to forcefully awaken and raise Kundalini and if one does not cons=\r\nciously think in terms of raising Kundalini, one is safe.\n&gt; (6) If one is n=\r\not looking for any specific results and doing a mantra just for spiritual p=\r\nrogress with a sense of surrender, one is safe.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; Apart from assessing the readiness, there are some more functions perf=\r\normed by an initiating guru:\n&gt;  \n&gt; (1) A guru can jumpstart one&#39;s sadhana w=\r\nith a mantra and results can come faster.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, this expects a gur=\r\nu of some caliber and achievement with the mantra. After all, if one wants =\r\na one-on-one audience with Sachin Tendulkar or Roger Federer or Barack Obam=\r\na, being introduced to them by someone they know and someone that had a one=\r\n-on-one audience with them earlier can be helpful (instead of introducing b=\r\ny oneself). If someone who merely read more about them but is not any close=\r\nr to them tries to introduce you to them, will it even get their attention?=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Now-a-days, most people do not have access to gurus who have experie=\r\nnced the divine with a mantra. Such people are very rare. One&#39;s best bet is=\r\n to do sadhana by oneself, using all the tools given by rishis and various =\r\nspiritual masters. When one is ready (and if it is needed), a guru may come=\r\n and take one&#39;s sadhana to the next level.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (2) A guru can mould the c=\r\norrect attitude in sadhaka before a sadhana is taken up.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, the=\r\nre are sadhakas initiated in powerful mantras and not having the right atti=\r\ntude. For example, I know people initiated into Bagalamukhi mantra and tryi=\r\nng to use it to win litigation. If one does not know that a &quot;Mahavidya&quot; (su=\r\npreme knowledge) is for overcoming conditioning and realizing self and not =\r\nfor winning court cases, one&#39;s initiation is no good.\n&gt;  \n&gt; On the other ha=\r\nnd, I know some people not formally initiated into Chandipath, but doing Ch=\r\nandi homam daily with saptashati and also navarna mantra. I know that they =\r\ndo not have any specific material goals and are overcoming the few desires =\r\nthat were originally there at the back of the mind. The are making quick pr=\r\nogress spiritually and their thinking is getting transformed nicely. Despit=\r\ne having no formal initiation, aren&#39;t they worshipping Chandi as a Mahavidy=\r\na?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bottomline is that one can mould one&#39;s own attitude through a form=\r\nal initiation or through reading scriptures, satsanga and constant contempl=\r\nation. One thing may work better in one case and another thing in another c=\r\nase.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (3) A guru can teach the correct procedure of a sadhana.\n&gt;  \n&gt; H=\r\nowever, role of procedural correctness in success is a higher in sadhanas f=\r\nor specific results than sadhana for spiritual progress. I maintain that th=\r\ne art of getting specific results from sadhanas is being hidden more and mo=\r\nre as Kali progresses, for a reason. I suggest that it is useless to even t=\r\nhink in those terms and pursue it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Mantras like navarna mantra can ju=\r\nst be meditated on, without any specific procedure. When one is ready and p=\r\nure enough, they can give one an experience of the divine. Mantras like Sid=\r\ndha Kunjika stotra, that codify several specific sadhanas to get specific r=\r\nesults, are anyway inaccessible to most people of this age! They are only a=\r\nvailable in codified form and gurus who can decode them will keep disappear=\r\ning more and more.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; For those who are alre=\r\nady doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation, there is\n&gt; &gt; no need to w=\r\norry or be confused. ... Please keep doing whatever you are doing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Gi=\r\nven this statement, the difference of opinion between us are very subtle.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; One word on guilt here. If someone is doing a practice and feels a sen=\r\nse of guilt, it blocks the practice from working effectively. Please do wha=\r\ntever sadhana you do, without a sense of guilt. If you have the sense of gu=\r\nilt, work on overcoming it. If you cannot overcome it, it may be a good ide=\r\na to find a sadhana with which you feel comfortable and have no sense of gu=\r\nilt.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Things will happen on their own accord in the natural flow. Le=\r\nave the rest to\n&gt; &gt; the compassionate Goddess.\n&gt;  \n&gt; That&#39;s the bottomline.=\r\n Even if one were initiated, it would be quite difficult to not leave thing=\r\ns to the Goddess and make things happen as one wanted. Start sadhana with s=\r\nome level of surrender. Then, sadhana will help increase the level of surre=\r\nnder. \n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Nagraj garu,\n&gt;  \n&gt; The opinion refer=\r\nred to in your question 2 is not without basis. But again, we need to under=\r\nstand the motivation to put it in the right perspective.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one exper=\r\niences divine through sadhana with Gayatri mantra (or any mantra), then it =\r\nis easy for one to experience divine with another mantra. One can just pick=\r\n up a mantra, do it and experience relatively quickly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, if on=\r\ne was merely initiated in Gayatri mantra (or any mantra) and did not really=\r\n make much spiritual progress with it, that does not place one in any kind =\r\nof advantage when it comes to sadhana with another mantra. That is my opini=\r\non.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Less=\r\nons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam an=\r\nd Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      =\r\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality=\r\n: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Dear Dr. Satya Prakash, \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I do see your points and=\r\n do understand that Sankara peethams discourage the practise of mahavidyas =\r\nwithout the Initiation.

The only major point where I disagree is whet=\r\nher one can do Sri Sri Chandi path *without initiation*. The rest of the co=\r\nnfusion on translation of mantras needs some clarification as there seems t=\r\no be some unnecessary confusion. A few pointers:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1.\tThere are vari=\r\nous sacred chants embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas etc. Broadly s=\r\npeaking such sacred chants can be categorised as mantras, stotras, kavachas=\r\n, dhyanams etc. Some stotras too are also treated as mahamantras and mantra=\r\ns.  The Samhita portion of the Vedas too is referred to as mantras.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; 2.\tUndoubtedly mantras and stotras have to be chanted in the original. R=\r\neading a translation is not even comparable to chanting the original chant.=\r\n So far it is fine.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3.\tWhilst mantra, stotra and kavacha are all b=\r\nased on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes a distinction between them.\n&gt; &gt;      \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; 4.\tAs per the traditional view one doesn&#39;t need to be initiated to chant =\r\na stotra or dhyanam. The case is not the same with most mantras. Mantras co=\r\nntaining bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas etc need initia=\r\ntion. This is the traditional view. Mantras from the Veda Samhita are not t=\r\nhe same as these other mantras that need initiation, which are generally re=\r\nferred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you call these mantras the ac=\r\ntual idea is that these mantras are integral parts of larger and distinct s=\r\npiritual specialities that need initiation, as in the case of Mahavidyas su=\r\nch as Kali or Sri.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 5.\tVishnusahasranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya =\r\nhrdayam etc do not need initiation as they fall under stotra category only.=\r\n Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are traditionally viewed not MERELY a=\r\ns stotras or parts of puranas. They have a larger status as integral parts =\r\nof a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them without initiation is not recommended=\r\n especially when the reader combines the navarna or shodashi mantras too as=\r\n an integral part of the chanting.\n&gt; &gt;            \n&gt; &gt; 6.\tI know from perso=\r\nnal interaction that acharyas belonging to both Kanchi as well as Sringeri =\r\nparamparas recommend initiation for both the sadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and=\r\n Sri Vidya along with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras=\r\n which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA) of the sadhana. Acharyas of b=\r\noth these traditions hold that one needs to be initiated to chant the Navar=\r\nna as well as shodashakshari mantras.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 7.\tRecapping my earlier sta=\r\nnce, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text that has an independent status by itsel=\r\nf as part of a Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a Mahavidya, a Yogasastra as=\r\n well as an Advaitic text in the spirit of the Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidy=\r\na the Navakshari is an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi path***. Thus tradit=\r\nion holds that one needs to be initiated to chant it. However if one wishes=\r\n to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred myth aspects of the Devi Mahatm=\r\nyam, , reading the sacred myth in the vernacular has been recommended in my=\r\n write-up, as chanting the original along with the navakshari  amounts to p=\r\nracticing the sadhana of a Mahavidya. In that case it is recommended to be =\r\ninitiated and go through the specialised sadhanas properly under guidance.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 8.\tArguably if an uninitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in =\r\nthe original Sanskrit as part of the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahav=\r\nidya, it has an inherent problem in our times.  The problem with attempting=\r\n to do a parayana of Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without initiation) i=\r\ns that most readers inadvertently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra o=\r\nr stotras such as the Siddhakunjika stotram which too contain the bijakshar=\r\nas.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 9.\tI you carefully peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, =\r\nforget translating, nowhere do I put down the Navarna mantra even in writin=\r\ng. Neither have I attempted to write a commentary on it. Translations of ma=\r\nntras do not have the power of the original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However=\r\n it is recommended to know the essence or import (artha) of the mantra and =\r\nits sadhana while chanting it. Infact `artha&#39; is the import, the essence of=\r\n `Vak&#39;, not a translation! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 10.\tFor those who are already doing Sr=\r\ni Sri Chandi path without initiation, there is no need to worry or be confu=\r\nsed. There has to be a certain level of samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri=\r\n Chandi path itself. We all have it. Otherwise we would not be doing it (in=\r\nitiation or no initiation). Please keep doing whatever you are doing. Just =\r\nbe cautious not to do sakama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has rightly pointed=\r\n out it is better to just do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for any favours or =\r\nresults. That attitude itself will reduce a lot of the potential problem. T=\r\nhings will happen on their own accord in the natural flow. Leave the rest t=\r\no the compassionate Goddess.              \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hope the above pointers=\r\n help in clearing any confusion.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Satya Prakash     =\r\n           \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, h=\r\n ramalingam &lt;hramalingam@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I wan=\r\nt to share one anecdote happened in front of Kanchi Maha Sannidanam Sri\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Sri Chandrasekara Bharathi Swamigal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When Swamigal was staying in a=\r\n camp near Mysore in Karnataka One day all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; learned persons male a=\r\nnd female alike\n&gt; &gt; &gt; requested Swamigal to translate Sri Vishnu SahasraNam=\r\nam in kannada language\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so that they can chant knowing the meaning ful=\r\nly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swamigal didn&#39;t reply to this request which was made early in the=\r\n morning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Later in the day after the days pooja etc were over as usua=\r\nl Postman came to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; camp to deliver the posts came to Kanchi Mutt Swami=\r\ngal. Swamigal was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seriously looking at the cover\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in front of th=\r\ne learned members and was looking at one line written as PIN\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Code and=\r\n followed by six numbers. Then he asked the learned members to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; explai=\r\nn the meaning of PIN Code and no one could tell that. But everyone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; un=\r\nderstood the significance of that number. Then swamigal asked his crew\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; member to pick up one LIFCO&#39;s abbreviations book from his library and rea=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the meaning as POSTAL INDEX NUMBER and told the group that even the=\r\n meaning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of PINCode was not known to the group and still it serves th=\r\ne purpose and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people are using it in day to day work. Similarly not k=\r\nnowing the meaning of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vishnu Saharanamam will not take away the benef=\r\nits of chanting the stothsram\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was he told the group. Hope the above i=\r\nncidence bring some clue to our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; discussion forum\n&gt; &gt; &gt; RamanaPatham\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On Tue, Oct 26, 2010 at 9:10 PM, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Girish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not at all against kn=\r\nowing the meaning, so that one can immerse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; oneself in what one is c=\r\nhanting. That is definitely the ideal situation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If that is=\r\n not possible, what I am saying is that reading something\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; composed =\r\nby an elevated being even without understanding the meaning is very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n useful. Suppose someone does not understand what Ganapathi Atharvaseersham=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; means, thinks in general that it extols Ganapathi as the source of=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything and chants it with a sense of surrender to Ganapathi. O=\r\nne can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still benefit immensely. If one is not experiencing anything=\r\n, it is more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; likely because one does not have the correct attitude =\r\nand surrender and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably not because one does know the specific m=\r\neaning of Ganapathi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Atharvaseersham. Many people knowing the meanin=\r\ng and chanting may also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The wor=\r\nds uttered by a realized soul have meanings at many layers and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lite=\r\nral meaning is only one superficial layer. Some important layers are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; lost in translation. The most important layers of meaning are never\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; understood intellectually, but only experienced internally.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Whether you know the meaning or not, chant the mantra with a calm and\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; relaxed mind and with devotion and surrender. Many people keep a tar=\r\nget\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; count and race through it or do it mechanically with a sense of=\r\n duty. If it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is done even with a little bit of love and surrender t=\r\no the deity, it can do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something. The key to success with a mantra =\r\nis calmness of the mind. If a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind is filled with thousands of thou=\r\nghts and chanting of the mantra is just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one of those thousand activ=\r\nities, nothing will happen. If most thoughts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subside and mind is es=\r\nsentially reverberating with a mantra, that is when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one experiences=\r\n a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are 4 levels of sabda. When one says a man=\r\ntra, physical vibration is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accompanied in other layers by the image=\r\nry in the mind, the thoughts and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instincts in the conscious and sub=\r\n-conscious mind etc. Some mantras composed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by (or revealed to) grea=\r\nt rishis/yogis (essentially beings with very stable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and calm minds)=\r\n are designed such that the physical vibration of the mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can ev=\r\nentually cause the corresponding imagery in the mind by resonance,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwhen other mental activity subsides. Thus, after repeating the mantra and\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; calming the mind down, you can recreate a certain imagery and though=\r\nt system\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in your mind. That can permanently alter the way your mind=\r\n workd. But the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; key is to attain a reasonably stable, focused and c=\r\nalm mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sant Dnyaneshwar&#39;s Marathi interpretation of Bhag=\r\navadGita and Sant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compositions have a power of the=\r\nir own, as they were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realized souls. In comparison, for examplle, S=\r\natyadevaashtakam composed by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me, though in metrical Sanskrit, will =\r\nnot have a similar power.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F=\r\nree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do I=\r\nt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films t=\r\nhat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;http://saraswatifilms.org/=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n ---- Girish Shahapurkar &lt;geniusgirish@&lt;geniusgirish%40yahoo.co.in&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would it not be of immense help to t=\r\nhe ordinary person whose knowledge of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is limited not only =\r\nto &quot;understand&quot; what he says but also take more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interest, enjoyment=\r\n, and truly get immersed in what he is reciting/ reading?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think=\r\n this is the reason for the great saints like Sant Dnyaneshwar to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nompose the Bhaavarth Deepika in Marathi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I agree with you tha=\r\nt the sacred stotras should be recited in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sanskrit...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hum=\r\nbly,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Girish Shahapurkar\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 26/10/10,=\r\n Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&lt;pvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@ &lt;pvr%40charter.net&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: =\r\n[vedic-wisdom] Translations, Initiation, Vedic vs Tantrik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: =\r\nTuesday, 26 October, 2010, 2:53 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will give my 2 cents on a few points.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I once wanted to translate Devi Saptashati into=\r\n my mother tongue Telugu\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in poetic form, so that Telugu people who =\r\nfind Saptashati too complicated to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; read or feel uncomfortable becau=\r\nse they do not know the meaning, can read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Telugu version instea=\r\nd. When I floated the idea, Manish discouraged me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He asked me, &quot;wh=\r\no do you think you are?&quot; He said that it could be considered\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later,=\r\n but firmly told me to drop the idea for then.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please n=\r\note that the goal of sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; m=\r\nantras and prayers, is NOT just an intellectual understanding of what they\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean. They are tools to silence the mind and channel its energy. Th=\r\ney are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; storehouses of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhaka=\r\ns, who used them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the past.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An intellectual u=\r\nnderstanding may help facilitate the right mood, right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frame of min=\r\nd and right imagery. But, even without it, a mantra that was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used b=\r\ny great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact=\r\n, the words of a rishi that one cannot intellectually understand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ca=\r\nn be more effective for spiritual progress, than the words of a normal\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; person that one can intellectually understand and appreciate. So, I sug=\r\ngest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not worrying about whether one understands or not and reading =\r\nSanskrit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras coming from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I were to give an analogy in terms =\r\nof playing cricket, a batsman may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; read a lot of scholarly analysis =\r\non how to play shots, how to see the ball\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the hand of the bowl=\r\ner, how to move feet, how get into the line of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ball, how to pla=\r\ny it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to play =\r\nback foot etc. But that does not necessarily make one a good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; batsma=\r\nn. If one practices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; basic understanding of principles is needed. But, above that, practice i=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more important than bookish knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Simila=\r\nrly, some conceptual understanding is important in spirituality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; als=\r\no, but above that, sadhana is more important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The essen=\r\nce of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all paths is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very =\r\nsimple. It is that we should overcome the notions that we are doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n things and realize that the divine acts through all of us. The divine acts=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through each being based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives correspon=\r\nding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reactions. One goes through the cycle until one overcomes the =\r\nnotions of &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike=\r\n that&quot; etc. Though this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the essence of all scriptures and one kn=\r\nows it, one may be deluded again\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and again. There is no magic formu=\r\nla to internalize this understanding fully\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and overcome the instinc=\r\nts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, even if one=\r\n practices a mantra that one does not intellectually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand, th=\r\nat is ok. As long as the basic essence of scriptures is at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back=\r\n of one&#39;s mind, one is constantly contemplating and watching over one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; own thoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts, one&#39;s sa=\r\ndhana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will yield results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; This is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to read\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; scriptures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people (phy=\r\nsically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or virtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that =\r\nwill only create\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a theoretical understanding. For it to be internal=\r\nized and to govern all of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, on=\r\ne needs to do sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One doing sadhana without a basi=\r\nc theoretical understanding of what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what and what we want, is li=\r\nke a blind person running around a mountain,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of climbing it=\r\n. One not doing sadhana, but having an excellent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theoretical unders=\r\ntanfing, is like a person who knows that he needs to climb\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the moun=\r\ntain, but keeps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the statement that initiation =\r\nis important in tantric path but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not in Vedic path, I want to add m=\r\ny 2 cents.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *dis=\r\ntinct* paths or parts of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continuum is debatable. There are a lot =\r\nof inaccurate notions today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The issue is not really Ta=\r\nntrik vs Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s attitude and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what one wants. Any=\r\nbody who wants specific material results needs to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; careful regard=\r\ning how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; partic=\r\nular result is not easy. It requires supervision of a good guru and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n not many are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT looking for\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; specific material results and is looking for spiritual progress, the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; constraints are fewer and options more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some may=\r\n sub-consciously have a notion that Tantrik path is for begetting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\npecific material results and Vedic path is for self-realization. That is\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic path may chant Manyu sooktam f=\r\nor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam for longevity, and so o=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gross substance in =\r\nan elaborate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ritual to reinforce the notion that &quot;all is Brahman&quot; a=\r\nnd to remove the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental repulsion towards some objects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My thumbrule is this. If you are looking=\r\n for a specific material result,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you need clear guidance and superv=\r\nision, which not many are capable of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; giving today! Instead, if you =\r\nwant spiritual progress and an increase of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your surrender, you can =\r\njust keep doing sadhana without initiation or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guidance. Just keep c=\r\nompany of scriptures and other like-minded people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Afte=\r\nr all, if you want to go to Calcutta, you need clear and precise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; di=\r\nrections and some supervision. If you just want to go to north pole, you\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can keep walking towards north.

Since\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the last 4-5 =\r\nyears I have preferred to stay away from internet forums due to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; var=\r\nious reasons. It has been nearly a year since I interacted on an internet\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; forum. However after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the original=\r\n post\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with my write up to my inbox, I visited this forum and quickl=\r\ny browsed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through some posts. I am happy to note that the general a=\r\ntmosphere here is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; far better and more sincere than a lot of other f=\r\norums. Having quickly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; browsed through this particular thread, I tho=\r\nught that I might reply to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important question =\r\nregarding the necessity\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of initiation. I will address it after summ=\r\narizing the big picture that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; needs to be invoked in order to unders=\r\ntand the ONE question and the MANY\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; answers possible. Firstly is the=\r\n question a general or specific one?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Generally speaking if the ques=\r\ntion is whether initiation is an absolute\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requirement for spiritual=\r\n life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the question is ab=\r\nout the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enjoined=\r\n by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82?YES.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes=\r\n; thereby the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessity for multiple approaches and multiple paths.=\r\n Thus arises the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pan=\r\n-Indian context there are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many paths for sadhana. But in the curren=\r\nt context of this question I will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; restrict myself to only the five =\r\nthat are relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nb. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga =\r\n(Tantric)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Acti=\r\nons)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual life is =\r\nnothing but the practicalisation of the great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; abstract Truths of th=\r\ne Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods and=\r\n techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nn experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; techniques employed by each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fo=\r\nr those who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\npeaking even the external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direc=\r\nt path\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) an=\r\nd Vichara\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culminatio=\r\nn of the Vaidik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; system it has retained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swad=\r\nhyaya&#39; (regular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-study of texts) too as an important practice. =\r\nAll of these practices\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a margi=\r\nnal role for external practices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga additionally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting onesel=\r\nf towards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Supreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of=\r\n Yogamarga\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emphasise only the first two as they subscribe to nirish=\r\nwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga =\r\n(Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Iswara&#39;s wil=\r\nl through total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; empha=\r\nsis in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nEngaging in actions without attachment to the results is the mainstay of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Karma marga of the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity=\r\n of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of =\r\ncertain occult\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truths via the energetics of Sabda through the emplo=\r\nyment of Vak. It\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab ex=\r\nperiment and thereby\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certain regulations and safe practices. It sho=\r\nuld be remembered that except\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire o=\r\nr Agni at various levels, while Bhakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predominantly invokes Soma (=\r\nthe reference here is to the age-old\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the pa=\r\nths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fire of the inte=\r\nllect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; austerity, a=\r\nnd yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals w=\r\nith the fire of Vak through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Si=\r\nnce Tantra employs highly powerful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; techniques that bring results mo=\r\nre quickly it lays great emphasis on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adhikara. Adhikara is not abou=\r\nt authority but more about qualification.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would you allow a child t=\r\no experiment with fire without any supervision?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does the supervisor=\r\n need experience and training or not? Like any other lab\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiment=\r\n proper training and experience are part of the procedure apart\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fro=\r\nm certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too. However the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; lab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the experiment is awakening th=\r\ne Sakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Ku=\r\nndalini Sakti).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation=\r\n, I will refrain from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; further discussion on the Kundalini. Without =\r\ngoing into other needless\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; details here, I will just elaborate on in=\r\nitiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major=\r\n river\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the =\r\nentire Sakta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually t=\r\nhree major schools\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that are full-fledged living traditions among th=\r\ne DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi s=\r\nadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vidya sadhana belongs to Srik=\r\nula. Just to make the picture more complete the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vajrayanas among th=\r\ne Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; familiar w=\r\nith Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\nri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that S=\r\noma is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Som=\r\na, at least at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; major milestones in the internal spiritual journ=\r\ney. The yantra, mantra,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a=\r\n particular set of synchronistic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frequencies for each of these thre=\r\ne lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; entry of the practitione=\r\nr into a particular spiritual lineage of that path\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (kula). The Guru=\r\n parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself at=\r\n the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sub-branches=\r\n and twigs spread out progressively downward till the individual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sa=\r\ndhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; metaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the =\r\nTantric\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advocate that initiation not only completes the circuit nec=\r\nessary for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conduit of electricity but also prevents short circu=\r\nit. Imagine many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beautiful\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bulbs/lights at each point in =\r\nthis inverted tree of live wires, where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is a long series of s=\r\nadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; till Siva himself=\r\n. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Sabda). Now b=\r\nack to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nAs already stated Sakta sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in=\r\ndividual consciousness through an integrated approach that combines the\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and integrated appro=\r\naches\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri Sri Cha=\r\nndi seemingly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also=\r\n a full-fledged\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is a=\r\nlso simultaneously a text\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. Th=\r\ne question of initiation is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relevant only to those following the Ta=\r\nntramarga and thus employing the text\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a mantramaya text . For th=\r\nose who explore the text as a yogasastra, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; esoteric meaning is m=\r\nore relevant which I have covered extensively in my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; write-up. For t=\r\nhose who are already inclined to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chandi =\r\nprovides the context for immensely powerful reflections through its\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n central message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory =\r\nin the text is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in =\r\nfull-fledged Upanishadic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fashion that She is one without a second, =\r\nsaying &quot;I alone exist in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; universe. Who else is there besides m=\r\ne?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the other\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mahavakyas of the Upanishads =\r\nand reflect on the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in Engl=\r\nish or any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other regional language is because understanding the mea=\r\nning and constant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reflection are possible only when one repeatedly =\r\nreads the text in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; language that they can fully follow. The main i=\r\ndea of the writeup is to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic =\r\ntext too apart from its obvious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; status as Sacred myth. However Sri =\r\nSri Chandi is also equally regarded as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sruti just as the Veda Samhi=\r\nta, especially the four hymns. In that regard\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all the applications =\r\nof Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are equally\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible with Sri S=\r\nri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone who is a=\r\ncquainted with the original Vedic method will straightaway\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identify=\r\n that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the worship\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a o=\r\nne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just as some practitioners =\r\ndo the Homam as an integral part of Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Chandi sadhana in accor=\r\ndance with the Vedic approach, there are those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who adhere to the Ta=\r\nntric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; marga. It is th=\r\nis particular approach that needs initiation as per its own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; princip=\r\nles. Initiation is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pauranic approach of reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Lik=\r\newise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Homam too is not required if one is not inclined to the predo=\r\nminantly Vaidik\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit from any=\r\n or all of these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to b=\r\near in mind that the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; living and breathing traditions of both Kaliku=\r\nla as well as Srikula as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practiced originally in various parts of t=\r\nhe subcontinent originally trace\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves to Tantra marga and hen=\r\nce the importance of initiation for those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paths, be it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sr=\r\ni Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nmerthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa et=\r\nc\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are all effective. However depending on the individual temperamen=\r\nt, aptitude\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc., some of these methods are more suited relatively =\r\nto different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practitioners. One may progress through a combination =\r\nof any of these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods in spiritual life. However the *full-fledge=\r\nd* integrated approach of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha too. It i=\r\ns this big picture against which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the answer to the question has to =\r\nbe contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fina=\r\nlly one last word. Irrespective of the method and path,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SWADHYAYA a=\r\nnd SATSANGHA are the most effective methods for all of us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swadhyay=\r\na is regular self-study of texts followed by reflection on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; trut=\r\nhs expounded in the texts. This is best done in a language that one is\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate method (though not a=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsangha and sa=\r\ntsangha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alone that enables one to make rapid progress in spiritual =\r\nlife. Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of =\r\nserving, listening\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to and spending time in the company of sadhus an=\r\nd sants in his younger days.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath=\r\n made a quantum leap in their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual lives after they attended t=\r\nhe Satsangha of Ramakrishna,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respec=\r\ntively.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who c=\r\nomplain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will just quote=\r\n Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint =\r\nby householders nowadays that there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are no good Mahatmas. This is a=\r\n lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question of supply and dem=\r\nand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come at once. Th=\r\nis is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thirsty, you =\r\nwill find your Master at your threshold. You lead a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happy-go-lucky =\r\nlife, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not c=\r\nare a bit for higher divine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, =\r\ngreed,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good =\r\nSatsanga.&#39;...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then come t=\r\no me. I shall take you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will =\r\nput you in the right path, guide\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you and elevate you to sublime hei=\r\nghts. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; waiting to get hold of th=\r\ne right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Real seekers a=\r\nre few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatm=\r\nas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after Tr=\r\nuth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a =\r\ncertain extent even this forum is an opportunity for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Satsangha.

However, one without a rich father is still be=\r\ntter off\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opening a bank account with a zero balance and building it=\r\n up slowly with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not finding a g=\r\nuru can still do sadhana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with famous mantras and build one&#39;s own sp=\r\niritual account. If you find a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guru to initiate you (not as a forma=\r\nlity, but truly initiate you), get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; initiated. Otherwise, just go ah=\r\nead and do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n(2b) Mantras and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gettin=\r\ng specific material results and (ii) as tools of increasing surrender\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; and making spiritual progress. In the case of (ii), initiation is not th=\r\nat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important. But, in the case of (i), there are pitfalls and a gur=\r\nu can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prepare one sufficiently. One can get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I sa=\r\nid several times, there are very few people who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can do (i) now-a-da=\r\nys. Nature has destabilized the whole system, for a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reason, as Kali=\r\n progressed. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; increasin=\r\ng surrender, getting whatever material results god wants to give\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an=\r\nd making spiritual progress. If one is meant to do rituals for begetting\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *specific* material results (for oneself or others or society/univers=\r\ne in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; general), Nature will make arrangements for one to get correct=\r\n knowledge of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such rituals. But, as one starts, one should start wi=\r\nth the attitude of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any rit=\r\nual or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any homam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have several materi=\r\nal desires, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of this r=\r\nitual, god may give any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; material results or spiritual results and n=\r\not necessarily fulfil my desires.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will accept whatever god gives.=\r\n I want to increase my devotion and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surrender and make spiritual pr=\r\nogress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; required. That attitu=\r\nde itself is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; fewer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast, but there may be some=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person i=\r\ns taking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rotten fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them in gar=\r\nbage and trying to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; retrieve one good fruit from under them. If the =\r\nperson is gentle, one may do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it gently and the spillage of rotten f=\r\nruits on the floor will be minimal. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the person is aggressive, on=\r\ne may do it fast and there may be more spillage\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of rotten fruits on=\r\n the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fruits will b=\r\ne retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; basket.=\r\n The deity is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out th=\r\ne good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like=\r\n Chandi or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, =\r\nbut the good fruit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember that these fruits are no=\r\nt deity&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; creations, but fruits of your own actions. Without sadhan=\r\na, you would&#39;ve had\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to eat each of those rotten fruits before eatin=\r\ng the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to take some of the spillage of rotten\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n fruits is better off avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi and staying wi=\r\nth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gentler deities. If initiation if made mandatory, one can be ass=\r\nessed by a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guru before starting a practice. If you realize the abov=\r\ne, you can start\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras without initiation. If some bad results oc=\r\ncut, you have to realize\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it is a fruit of your own actions and=\r\n the deity is trying to accelerate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; good results. If you are weak-he=\r\narted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp in their life and we=\r\nre\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam now.

I know that some of them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have transformed a lot and have experie=\r\nnced some things too. Obviously, they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have done sadhana with fire a=\r\nnd sadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mother in some past live=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this =\r\nage of ignorance and rank materialism, if someone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has even a faint =\r\nidea that spiritual progress is important, is looking for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; god and i=\r\ns attracted to a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nperson obviously has some good karmas and good vasanas. That person has don=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that sadhana in the past.
