To light a candl=\r\ne, you need a burning candle. Even an illumined soul alone can enlighten an=\r\nother soul.\n\nSome do meditation for some years independently. Later on, the=\r\ny actually feel the necessity of a Guru. They come across some obstacles in=\r\n the way. They are unable to know how to obviate these impediments or stumb=\r\nling blocks. Then they begin to search for a Master.\n\nOnly the man who has =\r\nalready been to Badrinath will be able to tell you the road. In the case of=\r\n the spiritual path, it is still more difficult to find your way. The mind =\r\nwill mislead you very often. The Guru will be able to remove pitfalls and o=\r\nbstacles, and lead you along the right path. He will tell you: &quot;This road l=\r\neads you to Moksha (liberation); this one leads to bondage&quot;. Without this g=\r\nuidance, you might want to go to Badrinath, but find yourself in Delhi!\n\nTh=\r\ne scriptures are like a forest. There are ambiguous passages. There are pas=\r\nsages which are apparently contradictory. There are passages which have eso=\r\nteric meanings, diverse significance, and hidden explanations. There are cr=\r\noss-references. You are in need of a Guru or Preceptor who will explain to =\r\nyou the right meaning, who will remove doubts and ambiguities, who will pla=\r\nce before you the essence of the teachings.\n\n\n\n"}}
