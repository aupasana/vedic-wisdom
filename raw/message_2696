For example,=\r\n ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limited to the physical body, bu=\r\nt extends to subtle body and causal body as well. In fact, ego resides in t=\r\nhe causal body and affects other bodies. Out of the four antahkaranas, chit=\r\nta (remembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are part=\r\ns of the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n \nAhamkaara=\r\n/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-motor mind) observ=\r\nes sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or thinking mind) analyzes curren=\r\nt and past observations of mind or chitta (remembering or conditioned mind)=\r\n stores various observations or retrieves previously stored observations, t=\r\nhey are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness permeates t=\r\nhrough all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n \nUpanishads and v=\r\narious scriptures have broken down the individualized consciousness into va=\r\nrious groups by functionality, like five koshas, three sareeras, five praan=\r\nas, five jnaanendriyas, five karmendriyas, four antahkaranas, six/seven cha=\r\nkras etc. But ego/ahamkaara/I-ness is the very basis of the entire individu=\r\nalized consciousness.\n \nThough the word jnaana means different things to di=\r\nfferent people, a jnaana yogi pursues Self by the path of contemplation and=\r\n discrimination. When a jnaana yogi reaches the final target, all bodies an=\r\nd koshas are merged in cosmos.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/v=\r\nedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n=\r\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jaganna=\r\nth Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n \n---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya=\r\n@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;    In my opinion=\r\n, there are three distinct phases that lead the sould to rise above Ego, Mi=\r\nnd and Chitta - corresponding to the three bodies physical (Sthoola), astra=\r\nl (Sookshma) and causal (Karana) resp.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rising above Ego is Jnana   - M=\r\nerging Physical body in Physical cosmos\n&gt; Rising above Mind is Vairagya - M=\r\nerging Astral body in Astral cosmos\n&gt; Rising above Chitta is Yoga   - Mergi=\r\nng Causal body in Causal cosmos\n&gt; \n&gt;    Finally, becoming established in Pa=\r\nra-Brahman is YogaArudha.\n&gt; \n&gt;    Your comments.\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Nitish\n&gt; \n&gt; -=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

I am not for this pat=\r\nh, but, to say, that is not a path, is perhaps unfair to all those who are =\r\ndestine to traverse that path.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         My statement was not agains=\r\nt the &quot;path of Gyana&quot;. Indeed it is one of the finest path I am sure.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;         However, my understanding of this path differs a little from yo=\r\nur understanding. Gyana, I believe, is not really study of scriptures or sc=\r\nholarly arguments, pros and con, debates etc etc. Gyana, in my opinion, is =\r\na state of being,  where one percieves a certain oneness in the universe. I=\r\nt is achieved through sadhana. To be constantly in a state of discriminatio=\r\nn between real and not-real, rejecting the non-real, such that whatever is =\r\nfinally left is nothing but the eternal. This is the sadhana of the marga c=\r\nalled Gyan. But sadhana it is without a doubt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         Whatever be=\r\n the path, sadhana is a must to achieve the results. Adi Shankara, they say=\r\n, was an expert in the scriptures and scriptural debates. But I feel, he en=\r\ngaged in all these once he had already become a gyani through his sadhana. =\r\nHe was not a gyani because he debated a lot or knew many scriptures, he was=\r\n a gyani because he had achieved a state of oneness. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         IMHO=\r\n, scriptural knowledge is not the marg of gyana.Gyana marg is more complex =\r\nand requires more than mere intellectual abilities.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         -Regar=\r\nds\n&gt; &gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt;          \n&gt; &gt;         The upsurge (of consciou=\r\nsness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         --- On Tue, 29/9/09,=\r\n pvklnrao &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           From: pvklnrao &lt;pvk=\r\nlnrao@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;           Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Order of Creation (of =\r\nmahabhuta/tattwa)?\n&gt; &gt;           To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt;      =\r\n     Date: Tuesday, 29 September, 2009, 11:09 AM\n&gt; &gt;             \n&gt; &gt;      =\r\n     Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           With all due respect, I disagree.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;           There is no question that is useless and there is no answer tha=\r\nt is not relavent. The reason we are not able to perceive God is not that G=\r\nod is not there, but, given our current way of thinking, he can not be perc=\r\neived. By Sadhana, you are trying to calm your mind and infact, make your c=\r\nurrent knowledge influence irrelavent which allows you to percieve thing yo=\r\nu can not otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           There are 4 known margas for self r=\r\nealisation. My understanding of any of these limited.\n&gt; &gt;           1. Bhak=\r\nthi - Surrender to God. Here you rest all other thoughts but for thought pe=\r\nrtaining to God. You do not question any thing related to him and give-in c=\r\nompletely to the believe that he is there and is your master. By doing so, =\r\nyou are coming out of the clutches of the regular perceptions or dimentions=\r\n of this material world.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           2. Raja - You focus on doing sp=\r\necific postures and concentrate deeply on the way you do things and draw yo=\r\nur self away from the regular senses.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           3. Karma - Unattac=\r\nhed karma. If you can do it, you are not even thinking about God, but, have=\r\n got him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           4. jnana - By questioning available informatio=\r\nn, using logic and try to break out of current assumptions and try to disco=\r\nver. Saying, this will not yield results is not a wise thing. How ever, per=\r\nhaps, this is the most defficult. But, with so many others who are experian=\r\ncing God, not sure, why the wrong in current axioms can not be corrected. U=\r\nnfortunately, those who are realised, do not perhaps think it is relavent.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           There is a soul. Now is Soul physical or not? Can it be =\r\nseen? If not with naked eyes, to see it materialistically, what is needed?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;           We can see the difference between a body with prana and =\r\nwith out prana. Can&#39;t we? Then, why can we try to narrow our focus and try =\r\nto see prana/atma sceintifically? I am not for this path, but, to say, that=\r\n is not a path, is perhaps unfair to all those who are destine to traverse =\r\nthat path.\n&gt; &gt;           Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;           Vijay\n&gt; &gt;           --=\r\n- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt;           &gt;\n&gt; &gt;           &gt; Dear Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt;           &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;      =\r\n     &gt; With all due respect to your query, I wanted to ask, how does it mat=\r\nter?
