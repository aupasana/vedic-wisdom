Due to an accide=\r\nnt when another priest was carrying the idol during a festival, the idol br=\r\noke oneday.\n \nThe priests and the highly learned scholars were in a quandar=\r\ny and conferred to decide what to do. The shastras were clear that a broken=\r\n idol could not be worshipped at a temple and had to be immersed in flowing=\r\n water. So the learned scholars recommended immersing the idol in Ganges.\n =\r\n\nRamakrishna was asked by the temple administration for his view. He though=\r\nt for a while and said calmly, &quot;Suppose you have a son and his leg is broke=\r\nn. Will you try to fix it and keep the son at home and continue to love him=\r\n or will you throw your son into Ganges?&quot; His simple common sense view prev=\r\nailed and shastras were set aside! In fact, Ramakrishna himself fixed the b=\r\nroken idol. It was re-installed at the temple and continued to be worshippe=\r\nd.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe idol was in your house for 56 years. Suddenl=\r\ny, the new found knowledge is creating problems in your mind, after all the=\r\nse years! What good is that knowledge which spoils mental peace by creating=\r\n doubts, fear and insecurity? One is better off being ignorant than having =\r\nsuch knowledge.\n \nIf you have an idol that was worshipped to some extent by=\r\n your ancestors for 56 years, it would&#39;ve captured and stored some of the p=\r\nositive energy and positive thoughts of those people. It would be a great b=\r\nlessing to have at your house.\n \nIt should not be a problem if you cannot d=\r\no much ritual worshp to the idol. Just doing simple things should suffice.\n=\r\n \nWhenever you see the idol, imagine that there is Ganesha in it for real. =\r\nLove the Ganesa who is in that idol. Bow to him now and then, when you get =\r\na chance. Show some fruit or raisins or something to the idol now and then,=\r\n when you get a chance, and imagine that Ganesa tasted them. Every few mont=\r\nhs, clean the idol in water and wipe it (to keep it clean).\n \nThe key is no=\r\nt how detailed your rituals are and whether you are doing 5 or 16 or 64 or =\r\nmore services in your ritual. The key is how strongly you imagine a real de=\r\nity in that idol and how deeply you love that real deity that you visualize=\r\n in the idol. Rituals are only meant to facilitate such a visualization and=\r\n increase such a love. They are neither necessary nor sufficient for establ=\r\nishing a relationship with a deity (which is, after all, the purpose of kee=\r\nping an idol)!\n \n*        *        *\n \nHow does a metallic (or stone or wha=\r\ntever) object become divine?\n \nOf course, each object and each atom of this=\r\n universe is filled, in essence, by Aatman or Brahman, i.e. non-dual god. B=\r\nut, that would apply to the idol as well as a sofa. But you look at an idol=\r\n as being more divine than the sofa. So we are not talking about the all-pe=\r\nrvading non-dual god here. We are talking about a deity within the field of=\r\n duality here. That deity is not present in sofa, but present in the idol. =\r\nBut, how does the deity get into the idol? Does the idol get that deity in =\r\nit simply because of its shape? Of course not!\n \nAll lokas and all devatas =\r\nare present within you in a microcosmic form. By the force of your thought,=\r\n you concentrate a part of the deity who is within you into the idol (or an=\r\ny object). When a priest with a good level of purity and good ability to vi=\r\nsualize (which comes from internal purity and lack of ego) does praana prat=\r\nishthaa in an idol, his visualization works using the praana pratishthaa ma=\r\nntra as an instrument and a deity&#39;s essence enters the idol.\n \nEven if you =\r\ndo not do a praana pratishthaa formally, deity&#39;s essence will slowly be est=\r\nablished in the idol if you keep imagining deity in the idol. It is all abo=\r\nut the power of thought! Thoughts of a pure mind that is not weighed down b=\r\ny a dense and heavy ego and not colored by too many terrible vaasanaas work=\r\n faster, but even thoughts of an impure mind that is weighed down by a dens=\r\ne and heavy ego and colored by several terrible vaasanaas will also work, a=\r\nlbeit slowly. If you keep imagining a deity with some qualities in an idol =\r\nover a long time, essence of such a deity will invariably be established in=\r\n the idol over the time! Otherwise, it is just a metallic object.\n \nIf you =\r\nimagine a deity who is angry with you for not taking good care of him, you =\r\nwill slowly create such a form in that idol. Please stop this negativity. I=\r\nmagine a beautiful, pleasant, happy and saattwika form with whom you can fa=\r\nll in love. If a feeling of love overwhelms your mind when you see the idol=\r\n (instead of thoughts of fear and deity&#39;s anger), it will indeed create suc=\r\nh a presence in the idol and do you good.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThere are=\r\n several *well-meaning* people out there with half-baked understanding that=\r\n is not based on any direct experience, who go around scaring people in sev=\r\neral matters relating to god, religion and spirituality. But god is not to =\r\nbe feared.\n \nLove god. Do not fear god. When your father or mother shout at=\r\n you or punish you, it is for a good reason and it will eventually be for y=\r\nour good. They are not really angry at you and they actually love you. Simi=\r\nlarly, when god punishes you or gives bad results, it is for a good reason =\r\nand it will eventually be for your good. Do not fear god even when god give=\r\ns you bad results. Always *love* god and love god very deeply. More deeply =\r\nthan you love your parents, spouse, children etc. That is a simple principl=\r\ne for sureshot spiritual progress.\n \nGood luck with your Ganesha idol no ma=\r\ntter what you decide to do with it!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast=\r\n.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Ja=\r\ngannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-----------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------- \n \n----- Original Message=\r\n ----- \nFrom: &quot;Ram R&quot; &lt;mantra2379@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, September 02, 2009 1:22 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nRight-sided Trunk Shri Ganesha Idol\n \n\n&gt; OM Namo Bhagvate Venkateshaya\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Dear All,\n&gt; \n&gt; This ia my first posting in this forum.\n&gt; \n&gt; Am writing in =\r\nas am in need of advice regarding a Shri Ganesha idol which we found during=\r\n puja in our home.

More deeply than you love \nyour parents, spouse, c=\r\nhildren etc. That is a simple principle for \nsureshot&nbsp;spiritual progre=\r\nss.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Good luck with your Ganesha idol no matter=\r\n what you decide to do with \nit!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Best \nregards,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----&lt;BR&gt;Do \na Short Homam Yourself: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/homam&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;Spirituality: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;Free Jy=\r\notish lessons (MP3): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A=\r\n \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Sri \nJ=\r\nagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.o=\r\nrg&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;----------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------- \n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;----- Original Message -----=\r\n &lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;From: &quot;Ram R&quot; &lt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:mantra2379@...&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;mantra2379@=\r\nyahoo.co.in&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nFONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;To: &lt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DA=\r\nrial size=3D2&gt;Sent: Wednesday, September 02, 2009 1:22 \nPM&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Right-sided Trunk Shr=\r\ni \nGanesha Idol&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt; \nOM Namo Bhagvate Venkates=\r\nhaya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear All,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This \nia my first posting =\r\nin this forum.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Am writing in as am in need \nof advice rega=\r\nrding a Shri Ganesha idol which we found during puja in our home. \nThis ido=\r\nl has its trunk to the right side and has been there in our house since \nth=\r\ne last 56 years. I recently came to know that when an idol of Shri Ganesha =\r\n\nwith its trunk to the right is kept at home one needs to worship it daily =\r\nin a \ndedicated way and we have honestly not being doing this all these yea=\r\nrs. It was \ninfact purchased by my grandmother 56 years ago as per my fathe=\r\nr who has been \nseeing it since then. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I feel that it is b=\r\netter to donate it to \na temple which would worship it daily. As it has bee=\r\nn there for so long in the \nhouse we are feeling hesitant about doing this.=\r\n Would be extremely grateful if I \ncould have advice as to what would be th=\r\ne correct thing to do and how to go \nabout doing the same.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Kindly pardon me if this is not the \nappropriate forum for such a query.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramesh \nM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bangalore &lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BO=\r\nDY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_022E_01CA2C1E.380A4A80--\r\n\n"}}
