Rao\n    Sent: Mon=\r\nday, March 02, 2009 8:09 AM\n    Subject: Re: On Remedial Measures Differenc=\r\ne (Re: Resolving Points)\n\n\n    Dear Narasimha,\n\n    When the sadhaka efface=\r\ns his own personality such that the deity of the mantra comes and occupies =\r\nhim, then at that stage there is\n    no real difference between the sadhaka=\r\n and the Deity(even if the deity is with the sadhaka all day I would say th=\r\nat there is no real difference).\n    The difference that one feels is as fo=\r\nllows:\n    One feels a strange coolness on the skin and on the eyes.\n    A =\r\nfew repititions of the mantra bring about a situation where the deity posse=\r\nsses the sadhaka and the sadhaka&#39;s prana goes upward very quickly( Urdhwa R=\r\netas),\n    During all meditation the sadhaka sees the feet or clothes or ha=\r\nnds or face, etc of the deity sitting beside him along with minute details =\r\nof the room (even though the sadhak&#39;s eyes are closed).\n    The sadhak typi=\r\ncally becomes dreamless except for suchaka dreams.\n    The whole day the sa=\r\ndhaka behaves like a love lorn person. How can i again experience the Belov=\r\ned.\n    That then is the experience of mantra when it is done correctly.\n  =\r\n  When the sadhak&#39;s personality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s personalit=\r\ny sits there then the sadhak experiences himself as that Deity(Devata).\n   =\r\n There then arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a ce=\r\nrtain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that which ap=\r\npears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra devatas make th=\r\ne person care almost for nothing himself, so self identification is minimis=\r\ned and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution continues.\n    Remember, there is v=\r\nery little according to me which is black magic. It is all a use of Shakti.=\r\n If your Shakti and deity is a higher shakti such as Prachand Chandika, Mah=\r\naKali, Tara, Chinnamasta, then your power will be that of God himself( Prov=\r\nided you have Vijnana). After the death of the body, such a sadhaka joins t=\r\nhe realm of the deity or if he was originally a Nath or a Muni goes to a se=\r\nparate realm reserved for these beings.\n    Attacking such a sadhak brings =\r\nthe full bearing of karma onto the heads of the attackers and some people m=\r\nay realise this to their detriment( Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying=\r\n the city of Patan with his Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may =\r\neven equate this with black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(=\r\nBit like you attack a normal person, and you will get a result of this from=\r\n that same Atma whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if you a=\r\nttack somebody who is identifying with the universe and has very few karmas=\r\n left, then the Universe itself attacks you, because your attack is not on =\r\nthe sadhaka, but on his identification, ie God or the universe).\n    If peo=\r\nple persist in using the Shakti possesed by a small Pisacha, Bhuta, then th=\r\nere is only a little Shakti which can be used, moreover then their minds an=\r\nd intellects will not be free of identification with the body and so their =\r\nactions are those which are generally termed as black magic. These people u=\r\nsually join the same spirits which they have been using after death, this i=\r\ns not an enjoyable experience.\n    Imagine if somebody is worshipping Chand=\r\nika for a few lifetimes, then even in this birth he or she is drawn to that=\r\n deity and such a sadhak may acheive after a few repitions of a mantra(beca=\r\nuse of his previous effort).\n    On the other hand somebody doing this mant=\r\nra only in this lifetime may feel that the 64 things which bind every mantr=\r\na are crucial and may not acheive in this lifetime.\n    According to me the=\r\n proof of the pudding is in the eating, so let me suggest an easy sadhana.\n=\r\n    If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000 reititio=\r\nns of the Savitri(some call this the Gayatri, but the real Gayatri is hidde=\r\nn) every day, main constraints\n    Same time every day.\n    Same place.\n   =\r\n Same materials.\n    Same direction.\n    As little movement as one can.\n   =\r\n Count on rudraksha or Tulsi as is your inclination.\n    Complete restraint=\r\n on sex(from the mind and the body, not just the body), reduce food intake,=\r\n grow a beard.\n    Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels=\r\n are empty before you start.\n    Continue this for 100 days and do this who=\r\nle procedure 3 times.\n    See the difference in your personality before and=\r\n after.\n    Long and short , what is important is that life may be short, s=\r\no do some sadhana, and persist with that sadhana for as long as is physical=\r\nly possible.\n    I hope this clarifies some of the concepts which were bein=\r\ng discussed.\n\n    Kind Love and Regards\n    manish\n    You may post this on=\r\n the list as a clarification from me if you feel that this is suitable.\n\n  =\r\n  On Sun, Mar 1, 2009 at 10:12 PM, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;wr=\r\note:\n\n      Dear Sanjay,\n\n      &gt; Mantra Shastra is a very detailed work an=\r\nd includes mantra dosha etc.\n      &gt; It is very scientific and accurate. It=\r\n takes a lifetime to master this.\n\n      Some may be fascinated by the text=\r\nure, color and volume of the chaff and miss the grain.\n\n      Most people w=\r\nho talk about mantra shastra focus on the chaff and not on the grain.\n\n    =\r\n  &gt; You talk of begging God vs commanding God? Now where did that come from=\r\n?\n      &gt; How is it related to what is under discussion. Perhaps I have mis=\r\nsed many\n      &gt; mails and am not able to get the context. Trying to comman=\r\nd God is\n      &gt; *BLACK MAGIC* and this is detestable to say the least. The=\r\n attitude should\n      &gt; always be that of a beggar in front of God. If any=\r\none has said otherwise, I\n      &gt; also disagee with him/her.\n\n      I menti=\r\noned the above with respect to the need of thousands of mantras and technic=\r\nalities. If one does not want to command god and wants to be a beggar who w=\r\nill take whatever is given, there is no need for thousands of mantras and a=\r\nll the umpteen technicalities. These thousands of mantras and umpteen techn=\r\nicalities are for commanding thousands of different results from god. That =\r\nis why I talked of commanding vs begging. However, this commanding works sl=\r\nightly differently than one may imagine. I will elaborate.\n\n      Also, com=\r\nmanding god is NOT black magic. Commanding low level beings is black magic,=\r\n which can be accomplished even by a person not quite elevated spiritually =\r\nand suffering from a heavy ego. However, commanding higher beings such as g=\r\nods is possible only for a spiritually elevated person with no or extremely=\r\n small ego. This commanding that I am referring to is not an egoistic achie=\r\nvement. In fact, an egoist cannot achieve it. Only a person succeeding in c=\r\nompletely effacing individual ego can achieve this commanding! I will repea=\r\nt something from the previous mail to clarify:\n\n      The universe has many=\r\n lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings and many objects. There are i=\r\nnfinite karmic interactions possible between them. Accordingly, there are i=\r\nnfinite possible mantras. When one is able to perfectly control the mind an=\r\nd *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts but the mantra reverberating in=\r\n the mind constantly), then one experiences the mantra. This perfect absorp=\r\ntion of self-awareness in the mantra then causes internal changes by the fl=\r\now of energy internally in specific ways (specific to the mantra) and that =\r\ncauses corresponding external changes in the universe and corresponding kar=\r\nmic interactions between various objects.\n\n      Each set of &quot;karmic intera=\r\nctions between various objects&quot; is a &quot;result&quot;. Various mantras are for vari=\r\nous &quot;results&quot;. One may term merging self-awareness in a mantra fully and ge=\r\ntting a specific result from it as &quot;commanding a result&quot; from god. Whether =\r\nyou like the term or not, it is essentially that.\n\n      *        *        =\r\n*\n\n      But the bottomline is this: Only a highly purified sadhaka of very=\r\n low ego can command specific results from god (not for selfishness or even=\r\n ego satisfaction, but acting as an unattached instrument of Nature fulfill=\r\ning one&#39;s dharma set by Nature). Various mantras and technicalities of mant=\r\nra shastra taught by rishis are meant for such sadhakas.\n\n      Those are h=\r\nardly of use to so many people out there with dense egos seeking specific s=\r\nelfish results. They cannot command specific results from god (because of t=\r\nheir heavy attachment to the result, which is in turn due to their own atta=\r\nchment to a limited ego), even if they use all the techniques of mantra sha=\r\nstra and all the associated rules of astrology. Instead of wasting their ti=\r\nme with these technicalities, they will be better off learning to be good b=\r\neggars at God&#39;s door.\n\n      Just pick any prasiddha mantra or a mantra you=\r\n feel attracted to, without worrying about so many technicalities, and lear=\r\nn to be humble and surrender to the Lord. Patiently wait for him to give yo=\r\nu what you want. Like a beggar, take whatever and whenever he gives.\n\n     =\r\n Keep praying every day or every second when you are able to. Even when you=\r\n are not praying, remember him in all of your actions. When you enjoy somet=\r\nhing in the material world, tell yourself that it is his and that he gave i=\r\nt to you. If you remember him all the time, slowly the dirt in your mind wi=\r\nll start to get cleaned. This fixing of attitude is faaaaaaaaaaaar more imp=\r\nortant than picking the right mantra, right weekday, right tithi etc (that =\r\ntoo based on unreliable knowledge coming from questionable sources!).\n\n    =\r\n  *        *        *\n\n      There may be a mountain with thousands of path=\r\ns (mantra) for climbing it. Each path may lead to a different spot (differe=\r\nnt experience) on the top and show a different scenery (result). Expert adv=\r\nisors (astrologers) may tell you to use a specific path (mantra) to see a s=\r\npecific scenery (result). But such advice is useless to a handicapped perso=\r\nn without legs (a selfish person with dense ego). It is relevant only to pe=\r\nrson with legs and one who is strong and sturdy, who can successfully climb=\r\n the mountain (a reasonably detached person with very little ego).\n\n      E=\r\nven when you encounter a person who has legs and can actually climb the mou=\r\nntain, the stress should be on how to climb the mountain and traverse the l=\r\nong path, rather than which path to take. The astrologers who are bogged do=\r\nwn by all the technicalities and people who take customized mantra advice f=\r\nrom astrologers and think that they will get a result quickly by doing that=\r\n &#39;powerful&#39; mantra are missing the basic point. The power of a powerful man=\r\ntra is with respect to the experience and result obtained *after* one succe=\r\neds with the mantra. A partcicularly powerful mantra is akin to a path lead=\r\ning to a point atop the mountain where the view shows a particularly beauti=\r\nful scenery. But the bottomline is that you do have to survive the climb al=\r\nong the long path.\n\n      We need to emphasize the attitude and approach ne=\r\neded for the long climb, rather than emphasizing the choice of the path bas=\r\ned on horoscope. It is worth noting that so many great spiritual teachers w=\r\nho came in the last century or two did not emphasize picking the right mant=\r\nra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasized having the correct atti=\r\ntude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience, persistence, discipline, =\r\nhumility etc!!!! *That* is a lot more important and useful than trying to b=\r\ne oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and impress god.\n\n      *   =\r\n     *        *\n\n      &gt; when should the worship of a graha be done? Let us=\r\n say someone\n      &gt; wishes to worship Mars (Mangala graha). When do you th=\r\nink this\n      &gt; worship should be done?\n       \n      You can do anyday. P=\r\narasara does not mention any day for doing homam to a graha.\n\n      In fact=\r\n, if one wants, one can do a homam or worship to Mars (or any planet) every=\r\n day. It is even better that way.\n\n      If an astrologer suggests doing it=\r\n on a Tuesday, it is fine. But saying that doing it on so and so day will b=\r\nring serious dangers because Mars is an enemy of so and so planet would be =\r\nstretching things.\n\n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Where do you think Veda Vyasa (K=\r\nrishna dvaipaayana) got his\n      &gt; knowledge and those who wrote it as scr=\r\nibes for him, where did they get it from?\n       \n      From Self - from wi=\r\nthin. That is the source of all knowledge. A sadguru need not specifically =\r\nteach thousand things, but needs to open the door inside.\n\n      *        *=\r\n        *\n\n      &gt; OK, just spell it out. What is the reason for Gandanta b=\r\neing in 0 deg,\n      &gt; 120 deg and 240 deg of the zodiac if it is not a jun=\r\nction between agni\n      &gt; and jala...I want to her your words if you have =\r\nany.\n\n      Parasara&#39;s definition of gandanta is restricted to two neighbor=\r\ning areas in a contiguous space having a predominance of fire and water ele=\r\nments. &quot;I see fire and I see water.

Gandanta requires a *=\r\ntransition* in a contiguous space.\n\n      In your example of upapada lord&#39;s=\r\n tithi, there is no contiguous space where there is a water-fire transition=\r\n.\n\n      &gt; Now somewhere you talked of wasting time!!!

You keep saying Parasara says so a=\r\nnd yet there is nothing forthcoming.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; The rashi is associat=\r\ned with the Aditya as the rashi come into existence because of the Sun, whi=\r\nch is the agni tattva. Vara is also agni tattva among the panchanga of Jyot=\r\nisha. That is why Vaara is related to rashi. Karma has been advised in the =\r\nvaara of the lords of the rashi or the hora of the lords of the rashi relat=\r\ned to a bhaava and for this reason, fasting and other such karma related to=\r\n rashi are also based on this. [See Prashna Marga for details].\n      &gt; \n  =\r\n    &gt; Moon is the significator of the Aroodha. It is the *emotional content=\r\n* related to the maya manifestation of everything in life. Suffering is cau=\r\nsed as we do not fathom the karma associated that resulted in suffering and=\r\n fasting is a a means of self punishment and correction related to the raas=\r\nhi where the aroodha is. Just as Agni has the purity to burn the root of si=\r\nn, fasting on vaara related to the UL is surely going to cleanse the sins a=\r\nssociated with the suffering in it. While this may not give a 100% satisfac=\r\ntion as the *moon* content has not been addressed, at least the initiation =\r\nof the aroodha occurs and people find their partners, get married and get a=\r\nlong with life. Proof lies in the pudding and with so many cases where peop=\r\nle have fasted on UL days and have got result, we have found faith in these=\r\n teachings reinforced. Why fast? Fasting on vaara is a means to correcting =\r\nthe flaw associated with the raashi. Raashi is a quantity and hence it is r=\r\nelated to the material effects of the bhava and that is what people are loo=\r\nking for when they come to th astrologer. You have done well to recall my t=\r\neachings in this =E2=80=93 remember what I taught =E2=80=93 Men should wors=\r\nhip a female deity and women shold worship a male deity for the UL fasting.=\r\n I wonder if they really follow this.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Why not give fasting=\r\n at night instead of day? Sun is always good for the Upapada (Jaimini etc) =\r\nand that is why we have limited this to day fasting and not night fasting a=\r\ns well or 24 hour fast. This is my interpolation. [ satisfied J ] Elders wo=\r\nuld have given long periods of fast starting from the vaara, like keeping 2=\r\n1 days fast for the birth of child! You think I should be doing that! You t=\r\nhink anyone will lsiten. Try it yourself before asking me to advise those h=\r\nard penance kind of fasts.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Who says the Moon has nothing t=\r\no do with the arudha. It is the sustainer. Now people to an astrologer when=\r\n they are looking for getting married and hardly anyone comes these days as=\r\nking for prolonging marriage. Either they want to get into one or get out o=\r\nf one and into another...astrologers these days are relegated to helping pe=\r\nople make these transitions painless and fast. Of course some have come and=\r\n I have not failed them. I have a ready shloka for this =E2=80=93 start fro=\r\nm Taurus in Hamsa gati:\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Gouri, Kaali, Uma, Bhadraa, Durga,=\r\n Kanti, Saraswati\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Mangalaa, Vaishnavi, Lakshmi, Shivaa, Na=\r\nraayani\n      &gt; \n      &gt; See I have them ready for the 12 signs in Hamsa Ga=\r\nti from the mool trikona of Moon in hamsa gati\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Mantra Shas=\r\ntra is a very detailed work and includes mantra dosha etc. It is very scien=\r\ntific and accurate.

Perhaps I have missed many mail=\r\ns and am not able to get the context. Trying to command God is *BLACK MAGIC=\r\n* and this is detestable to say the least.

If anyone has said otherwise, I also disage=\r\ne with him/her.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Prasiddha mantras always give result, even=\r\n without initiation and who knows how ready a person is for initation.

Have you gone throu=\r\ngh the Navagraha mantras given in the Garuda Purana and other puranic liter=\r\nature?\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Parasara did *not* specify the weekday or tithi for=\r\n most of these homas (e.g. planetary homas). Only for homas for specific bi=\r\nrth doshas (e.g. Amavasya dosha or Moola dosha), he fixed the tithi or naks=\r\nhatra based on the dosha and the deity. But the days are not based on any h=\r\nouse or arudha in the chart.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] If Amavasya do=\r\nsha is to be performed on Amavasya, when should the worship of a graha be d=\r\none? Let us say someone wishes to worship Mars (Mangala graha). When do you=\r\n think this worship should be done?\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Thus, the principles I=\r\n am questioning are *not* from Parasara.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Wh=\r\nere do you think Veda Vyasa (Krishna dvaipaayana) got his knowledge and tho=\r\nse who wrote it as scribes for him, where did they get it from?\n      &gt; \n  =\r\n    &gt; Second, I said what I said in a *context*. People are mentioning comp=\r\nlicated principles that are not found in classics or works of rishis and sc=\r\naring people that performing austerities such as fasting on certain days ca=\r\nuse &quot;danger to spouse&quot; or &quot;serious doshas&quot; or &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, based on =\r\nhoroscope. I find these principles illogical and based on hasty thinking. T=\r\nhere may be a little difference between doing an austerity on different day=\r\ns, but my point is that it is smaller compared to the difference between do=\r\ning and not doing at all and that doing it on a &quot;wrong day&quot; does not cause =\r\ndanger as being suggested.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I am sorry. I mi=\r\nssed the context and just saw some mails that were forwarded to me amidst m=\r\ny writing. But them its always a pleasure to talk to you as in that many ma=\r\nny have benefitted, and that includes us as well.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Third, o=\r\nur shastras primarily talk about worshipping various deities on various day=\r\ns, based on the energy of the *deity*. For worshipping a certain deity, cer=\r\ntain tithi or weekday or nakshatra is better than others. This is based on =\r\nthe deity and irrespective of the person worshipping. Let me give an analog=\r\ny. If a rich man comes out with more money to give to beggars on a specific=\r\n day, a beggar is better off going and begging on that day. Schedule and mo=\r\nod of the giver is more important.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] That=E2=\r\n=80=99s not right...at least people who read this will think. Let=E2=80=99s=\r\n say Shiva worship on Mondays. Shiva is the pratyadhi devata of the Sun and=\r\n is not worshipped on Sundays but on Mondays. NOTE =E2=80=93 a day after Su=\r\nnday! Similarly Narayana is the pratyadhi devata of Mercury and is worshipp=\r\ned on Thursdays instead of Wednesdays. NOTE =E2=80=93 again a day after! So=\r\n what happened to the energy equation? J\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Choosing the day =\r\nof a remedy based on the deity is more important and the variations based o=\r\nn individual horoscope are less important. I am not saying there are no hor=\r\noscopic variations. But they are smaller and, more importantly, I question =\r\nif they are actually well-understood by astrologers today to apply *reliabl=\r\ny*. I question over-emphasizing and over-selling unreliable principles of q=\r\nuestionable origin and scaring people on that basis.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanj=\r\nay Rath:] To this I can agree as many have not understood even the basics o=\r\nf Sanatana dharma! Some behave as if there is a battle going on between Shi=\r\nva and Vishnu =E2=80=93 it=E2=80=99s hilarious to see how these are just at=\r\ntempts to convert Hinduism into a religion they have left rather than tryin=\r\ng to learn what Hinduism means. Being newly converted there is a bellicose =\r\npatriotism in them to prove their faith to the *new god* they have found an=\r\nd every other God must be the devil in disguise!! It will take years for ma=\r\nny to learn that there is no devil.

I got=\r\n into this thread because statements were made that fasting on particular w=\r\neekdays or tithis in a chart can cause &quot;insult to Vishnu&quot;, &quot;serious doshas&quot;=\r\n and &quot;danger to spouse&quot;, based on these far-fetched extrapolations of ganda=\r\nnta.\n\n      &gt; Which is perfectly in line with everything I have learnt.\n\n  =\r\n    Well, you once taught that houses represent Sun/Shiva/truth and arudhas=\r\n represent Moon/Gouri/perception. That was meaningful. Now, you associated =\r\nUL, an arudha, with Sun and fire and 12th, a house, with Gouri and water. I=\r\n question whether the new theory on fasting is really in line with everythi=\r\nng you have learnt (and taught).\n\n      BTW, I specifically asked for a cla=\r\nrification on whether this was based on your own thinking or from classics/=\r\nparampara (see quoted mail below for the full context). Like so many times =\r\nwith similar questions I asked privately and recently publicly, you did not=\r\n respond.\n\n      *        *        *\n\n      &gt; Statement 1 is an arrogance t=\r\nhat the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus\n      &gt; and has no relevance as th=\r\ne remedial measures prescribed by\n      &gt; Parasara and others to be done on=\r\n specific days are irrlevant and\n      &gt; not of much consequence.\n\n      Fi=\r\nrst of all, Parasara did *not* prescribe fasting on specific weekdays or ti=\r\nthis based on any arudhas or houses in a chart.\n\n      For doshas in birth =\r\nchart or to get relief from planetary afflictions or to get the blessings o=\r\nf planets, he suggested various *homas* (fire rituals) and described how to=\r\n perform them.

OR it is like saying that we can\n      &gt; take parace=\r\ntamol and pray that cancer is cured. I think I may have to\n      &gt; write a =\r\nbook on Mantra Shastra to validate the teachings of the vedic\n      &gt; seers=\r\n.\n\n      I did not say it is &quot;useless&quot;. Instead, I suggest that our ability=\r\n to use it is limited and we should take our limitations into consideration=\r\n.\n\n      The universe has many lokas (planes of consciousness), many beings=\r\n and many objects. There are infinite karmic interactions possible between =\r\nthem. Accordingly, there are infinite possible mantras. When one is able to=\r\n perfectly control the mind and *fill it* with a mantra (i.e. no thoughts b=\r\nut the mantra reverberating in the mind constantly), then one experiences t=\r\nhe mantra. This perfect absorption of self-awareness in the mantra then cau=\r\nses internal changes by the flow of energy internally in specific ways (spe=\r\ncific to the mantra) and that causes corresponding external changes in the =\r\nuniverse and corresponding karmic interactions between various objects.\n\n  =\r\n    However, this variety of mantras, experiences and results is irrelevant=\r\n to one who does not have such perfect control over the mind to absorb the =\r\nmind fully in a mantra. It is relevant only to a seer whose self-awareness =\r\nis quite evolved and hence control over mind impeccable. Such seers are ext=\r\nremely extremely rare today. Most people are unable to experience any mantr=\r\na and mantras do not work for them as they are supposed to.\n\n      *       =\r\n *        *\n\n      Just repeating a combination of sounds does not guarante=\r\ne anything. Some people may think that certain results come when they repea=\r\nt a mantra certain number of times. That is an incorrect notion. A mantra m=\r\nay work for one person quickly and another may spend the whole life chantin=\r\ng it and nothing may happen. Absorption of the entire mind into a mantra is=\r\n needed for a mantra to really work and it is much more difficult than one =\r\nmay think.\n\n      *        *        *\n\n      A highly learned scholar in th=\r\ne court of a king may be able to command the king and get whatever he wants=\r\n from king. An incapable one is better off begging the king, rather than tr=\r\nying to command (and failing for sure).\n\n      Similarly, most people are b=\r\netter off begging god for what they want rather than trying to use the righ=\r\nt mantra to command what they want. A beggar does not need a huge vocabular=\r\ny or great scholarship or knowledge. Feeling of humility and helplessness, =\r\nsurrender, patience and persistence are what help a beggar succeed. A begga=\r\nr needs the right attitude rather than knowledge. In this age and time, bes=\r\nt bet for most people is to learn to be a good beggar at god&#39;s door.\n\n     =\r\n What people today need for material and spiritual progress through remedia=\r\nl measures is a better attitude in begging god rather than a better choice =\r\nof tools such as mantras and other specifics such as weekday, tithi etc to =\r\ncommand a specific result from god.\n\n      It is worth noting that so many =\r\ngreat spiritual teachers who came in the last century or two did not emphas=\r\nize picking the right mantra based on horoscope etc. Instead, they emphasiz=\r\ned having the correct attitude - surrender, submission, devotion, patience,=\r\n persistence, discipline, humility etc. *That* is a lot more important and =\r\nuseful than trying to be oversmart with the choice of mantra, day etc and i=\r\nmpress god.\n\n      *        *        *\n\n      One more thing. We have many =\r\nmantras given by rishis, but the guidelines from rishis like Parasara on ho=\r\nw to pick a mantra based on the horoscope are very limited. Astrologers tod=\r\nay do not operate solely based on them. They use all kinds of other rules c=\r\noming from various traditions. They are not free from corruption and imperf=\r\nection. Most scriptures associate various mantras with various results, irr=\r\nespective of horoscope. For example, irrespective of who is the 6th lord an=\r\nd 8th lord and lord of A6 and A8, Rina Vimochaka Angaraka mantra is good fo=\r\nr debt control. And so on. Linking of horoscope is overplayed by today&#39;s as=\r\ntrologers, way beyond the scope of Parasara&#39;s guidelines.\n\n      If one has=\r\n a sadguru, I recommend following the word of sadguru rather than that of a=\r\nn astrology theoretician.\n\n      If not, there is no foolproof way to know =\r\nthe right path. Pick any path (given by an astrologer or one that you feel =\r\nattracted to) instead of wasting time and then keep working on your attitud=\r\ne. The latter is the key. As I said earlier, learn to be a humble beggar at=\r\n god&#39;s door. Choice of Mantra is secondary and attitude is primary. If you =\r\nsucceed in being a really humble beggar, you stand a better chance of succe=\r\nss than great scholars.\n\n      Any prasiddha mantra (e.g. ashtakshari, panc=\r\nhakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, vishnu sahasranaam, rudram, hare krish=\r\nna maha mantra, chandipath, ganapati atharva seersham, mrityunjaya mantra e=\r\ntc) can help one make progress if one develops the right attitude. Without =\r\nthe right attitude, even an impeaccably picked mantra will do nothing.\n\n   =\r\n   *        *        *\n\n      I hope this sufficiently clarifies my stand. =\r\nI discuss these matters related to spiritual sadhana more on the vedic-wisd=\r\nom yahoogroup.

Which is perfectly=\r\n in line with everything I have learnt.\n\n        Two statements you have ma=\r\nde contradict standard texts on Jyotish and Mantra Shastra. Please correct =\r\nme if I am not understanding you well out here -\n\n        1. Statement 1: *=\r\nfasting on any day or any tithi* is good so long as the sankalpa has been m=\r\nade for the devata you intend to pray to. Results maybe a bit delayed but w=\r\nill be there.\n        2. Statement 2: *reciting any prayer* will give the d=\r\nesired effects for any ailment we wish to remedy\n\n        Is this what you =\r\nintended to say or did I get this wrong?\n\n        Statement 1 is an arrogan=\r\nce that the entire Jyotisha shastra is bogus and has no relevance as the re=\r\nmedial measures prescribed by Parasara and others to be done on specific da=\r\nys are irrlevant and not of much consequence. This sounds like another astr=\r\nologer I had known some time back whose statements like this coerced me to =\r\nwrite Vedic Remedies in Astrology so that people are not misled but such pr=\r\netexts to knowledge.\n\n        Statement 2 is an arrogance that the entire m=\r\nantra shastra is useless and the Rishi=E2=80=99s were wasting time in givin=\r\ng so many mantras for the same devata, like say thousands of mantras for Vi=\r\nshnu or Hanuman when any one mantra would suffice. OR it is like saying tha=\r\nt we can take paracetamol and pray that cancer is cured.

The basic point is that=\r\n Upapada is a rashi and carries energy\n        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If yo=\r\nu fast on the day ruled by tithi of the 2nd\n        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are br=\r\ninging the jala energy to vara, and gandanta may\n        &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and =\r\nspouse may come into a danger. So, what is the way out.\n        &gt; \n        =\r\n&gt; Why does a rashi carry the energy of vaara only and not that of the tithi=\r\n???? Why does rashi represent vaara or fire?\n        &gt; \n        &gt; [Sanjay R=\r\nath:] Because Raashi were created by Surya and for doing so Surya took 12 f=\r\norms called the Dvadasa Aditya...Narasimha you ask this?? What is happening=\r\n?\n        &gt; \n        &gt; After all, Rudra rules over the element of fire and =\r\nGouri rules over the element of water and one worships Gouri at the time of=\r\n marriage. Moreover, Venus (water) is the karaka for marriage. So one could=\r\n even say that UL/marriage is represented by water element and fasting on U=\r\nL lord&#39;s tithi brings the element of water (prosperity and well-being) to o=\r\nne&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could even say that fasting on the weekday of UL lo=\r\nrd should be prohibited as it brings the fire element represented by weekda=\r\ny to the water of UL and causes &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n        &gt; \n        &gt; [Sanjay Ra=\r\nth:] UL is the Maya and is associated with the Raashi Narasimha. It is the =\r\n12L which is the creator of the UL...just as the mother Gouri creates every=\r\nthing through the shakti of the graha, all the arudha are created by her du=\r\ne to the lordships of the planets. So fasting on the tithi lorded by the 12=\r\nth lord will be a *more correct* answer.\n        &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n =\r\n       [Narasimha] We always say that houses (truth) are represented by Sun=\r\n (aatman) and arudha padas (maya) by Moon (mind).\n\n        Thus, 12th house=\r\n is the actual creator and UL is the apparent creator in the field of maya.=\r\n Houses (truth) should actually be associated with Sun (aatman) and Shiva (=\r\nand not Gouri), while arudha padas (perception) should actually be associat=\r\ned with Moon (mind) and Gouri. After all, that is what we do in the tripod =\r\nmethod in dasa judgment.\n\n        Thus, it is actually more logical to say =\r\nthat 12th house and 12th lord imbibe the agni tattva of Sun and UL and UL l=\r\nord imbibe the jala tattva of Moon.\n\n        Is the above &quot;*more correct* a=\r\nnswer&quot; based on your own thinking or is it from a classic or from tradition=\r\n?\n\n        &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n      &gt; The mantra one meditates with=\r\n at the end of a day&#39;s fasting is far more effective than at other times. T=\r\nhe conservation of energy otherwise spent on digestion or speech will enabl=\r\ne far more effective mantra meditation. So fast or keep mouna and then medi=\r\ntate with a mantra, to maximize the effect of the mantra.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; =\r\n[Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with this. Correct eating is the best blessin=\r\ng for good mantra practise. On days when one fasts the mind is troubled by =\r\nhunger causing the stomach to burn and churn and this disturbs mantra japa.=\r\n Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is many many times better than complete fast=\r\ning.\n\n      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n      [Narasimha] Well, if one cannot =\r\nfast, then one is destined to expend some energy on digestion after all and=\r\n not focus all energy on the mantra. But the bottomline is that shastras sa=\r\ny that one should meditate either without or with very little food (niraaha=\r\naro mitaahaaro). In any case, I hope we agree that meditation sessions afte=\r\nr heavy eating are heavily restrained in effectiveness.\n\n      &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin=\r\n quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n      &gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching of ganda=\r\nnta concepts is quite illogical.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] It is not =\r\nstretching ... it is the very definition of gandanta =E2=80=93 the interfac=\r\ne between fire and water. Put a burning match in a glass of water, the fire=\r\n dies...There are other Ganda=E2=80=99s in the chart but they are not anta =\r\n(ends). Take Chitra ganda between Kanya and Tula.\n\n      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n      [Narasimha] Putting a burning match in a glass of water does i=\r\nndeed kill fire. But the question is of contact. If I am thinking of fire i=\r\nn my mind while standing in water, it does not kill the fire. There is no c=\r\nontact.\n\n      My point is that the examples given have no real identifiabl=\r\ne contact between water and fire.\n\n      One can be creative and come up wi=\r\nth a lot of theories. For example, one can say that Moon and Venus are jala=\r\n tattva and all rasis show agni tattva (then why are some rasis marked as a=\r\ngni rasis and some as water rasis etc) and hence the sign occupied by Moon =\r\nand Venus cause contact between water and fire. Then one can say fasting on=\r\n the weekdays of the dispositors of Moon and Venus causes gandanta and seri=\r\nous danger.\n\n      It is not enough to show some fire and some water. See w=\r\nhat counts as contact. Otherwise, one will engage in illogical extrapolatio=\r\nns.\n\n      &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; Begin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n      &gt; Three years back you said you=\r\n are leaving jyotish....then again you told me two years back and again rec=\r\nently that you are leaving jyotish. Now it is getting very evident that *jy=\r\notish is leaving you*. The knowledge of Jyotish is PERFECT =E2=80=93 indivi=\r\nduals embody it in different levels of their understanding and intelligence=\r\n. \n\n      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n      [Narasimha] Nothing is permanent. =\r\nWhat is one&#39;s cannot be taken away. And one cannot cling on to what is not =\r\none&#39;s. Some rejoice when it seems like something comes and cry when it seem=\r\ns like something leaves. Some impassionately observe as things seem to come=\r\n and go and do what they see as their dharma with the things they seem to h=\r\nave.\n\n      Just a factual correction though\n      : I never said I was lea=\r\nving Jyotish. For a few years after my spiritual master entered my life, my=\r\n interest in other things went down (though I continued to do other things)=\r\n and my focus on spiritual sadhana intensified. So I said that my interest =\r\nin Jyotish was very low. However, my guru gave me a task later. He wanted m=\r\ne to study the teachings of Parasara independently, meditate on them and sh=\r\nare my interpretations with the world. He said I was very passionate in my =\r\nJyotish activities earlier, and he wanted me to do the same now but dispass=\r\nionately and without an attachment. He felt that I still have a contributio=\r\nn to make to Jyotish and wants me to do it as an unattached karma. His word=\r\n is everything for me.\n\n      What I told you recently is not that I was le=\r\naving Jyotish but what I said above.\n\n      However, if your judgment is co=\r\nrrect and if Jyotish is indeed &quot;leaving&quot; me, I am sure my spiritual guru wi=\r\nll realize it sooner or later and change his command to me.\n\n      &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; B=\r\negin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n      &gt; I can categorically declare one thing with utmos=\r\nt confidence. You pick any weekday or tithi and take a vow to fast or do mo=\r\nuna vrata (remain silent) on that weekday or tithi and meditate with a part=\r\nicular mantra (any) at the end of the day. You can take a vow to keep that =\r\npractice for a certain duration of time (say, a few months or years) for a =\r\nspecific purpose. Take a vow and keep the vrata for the duration. If brahma=\r\ncharya can be kept for the duration of the vrata, there is nothing like it!=\r\n\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] This is a fine  statement but then you see=\r\nm to be saying that the Puranas and other teachings of the seers is of not =\r\nmuch relevance. Of course you are right as it will be spiritually beneficia=\r\nl. For example, a person wishing to marry should not fast on UL days and sh=\r\nould choose any day (all days are the same) or any tithi (all tithi are the=\r\n same) and start fasting and do a mantra (any mantra!!) and then in a few d=\r\nays, or (maybe) a few months (or maybe) a few years ... or maybe (what you =\r\ndid not say), a few lifetimes, the marriage will happen! I cannot say you a=\r\nre wrong, so I agree that what you say is right.\n\n      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n      [Narasimha] This is a gross exaggeration.\n\n      Is all that is=\r\n being taught and practiced now strictly from &quot;Puranas and other teachings =\r\nof the seers&quot;?\n\n      I did not say all days and tithis are the same. Of co=\r\nurse, there is some difference. But, it is not as big as being made here.\n\n=\r\n      To make khoa, whether one uses cow milk or buffalo milk or milk of a =\r\nbrown cow or a black cow or a Jersey cow or another cow does make some diff=\r\nerence. But it is secondary. To say that &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas&quot; (see=\r\n the quoted mails for such claims) can be caused by a wrong choice is wrong=\r\n. To say that a wrong choice means khoa will take 100 years to make is also=\r\n a gross exaggeration.\n\n      The main thing is that you need milk and suga=\r\nr. If one is confused by endless claims of khoa making consultants and ends=\r\n up not making khoa at all, that will be sad. In such a case, one can simpl=\r\ny pick some milk or the other, take sugar and start cooking khoa. It will t=\r\nake an extra half hour, but the job will be done.\n\n      I request Jyotishi=\r\ns to behave responsibly and humbly and not engage in scare-mongering and sa=\r\ny that a speicifc austerity (fasting on a specific weekday or tithi in a ch=\r\nart) can cause &quot;danger&quot; and &quot;serious doshas&quot;. No wonder some spiritual teac=\r\nhers look down upon Jyotish and dismiss it. Such unbalanced attitude and se=\r\nlf-importance from us does not help our cause!\n\n      Yes, Jyotish is helpf=\r\nul, but let us not oversell it or overplay the importance...\n\n      &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; =\r\nBegin quote &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; \n      &gt; Gem stones may harm when used incorrectly. But,=\r\n austerities like prayers, fasting, mouna vrata and brahmacharya will NEVER=\r\n do you any harm. If your body can take fasting, you can do it on any weekd=\r\nay or tithi without too many calculations.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] =\r\nBrahmacharya is good for someone planning to have a baby or one who cannot =\r\nconceive and this is kept for some period before the appointed date of nish=\r\neka. Brahmacharya is good for marriage?! I think you are mistaking abstinen=\r\nce from physical union as Brahmacharya. Oh no its so different.\n\n      &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; End quote &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n\n      [Narasimha] Of course, brahmacharya is much more=\r\n, but also very difficult for most. Even physical celibacy is a good enough=\r\n austerity. Physical celibacy over an extended period of time increases the=\r\n efficacy of other austerities such as fasting, mouna vrata, meditation and=\r\n homam.\n\n      Best regards,\n      Narasimha\n      ------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n      Do a Short Homam Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n      Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n      Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n.home.comcast.net\n      Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org\n      Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagann=\r\nath.org\n      -------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----- \n       \n      --- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Sanjay Rath&quot; &lt;sjrath@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n      &gt;\n      &gt; om paramesthi gurave namah\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Dea=\r\nr Narasimha\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Just added a few thoughts and questions since =\r\nwe are on the topic of spirituality, which is not my forte.

It is funny that I should be typing this emai=\r\nl on an Ekadashi day, when many Vaishnavas fast irrespective of their horos=\r\ncopes.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I write on dvadasi when so many vasi=\r\nhnava also fast and keep great austerities. J Any difference?\n      &gt; \n    =\r\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Here is my point and view about the question raised. 2nd bhava is\n=\r\n      &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the bhava of Vishnu, sustainer, and if we fast on the day of U=\r\nL in\n      &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2nd house, we bring insult to Vishnu who provides the foo=\r\nd for us.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; My dear Zoran, please allow me to express my dis=\r\nagreement.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Austerities can never be seen as an insult to V=\r\nishnu. Self-deprivation of 2nd house matters such as food (fasting) or spee=\r\nch (mouna vrata - vow of silence) are austerities. Giving up food or speech=\r\n is not an insult to Vishnu just as giving up sex (i.e. brahmacharya) is no=\r\nt an insult to Sukracharya (Venus).\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I thoug=\r\nh Brahma was very angry that his sons decided not to have progeny and staye=\r\nd celibate. So He created others. Why was Brahma angry when his sons remain=\r\ned celibate? Why should Sukracharya be angry if someone is celibate? How is=\r\n it an insult or not an insult to Sukracharya? You are taking planet signif=\r\nication of Venus for 7H ...and linking this to creation process...which is =\r\nwrong Narasimha. Brahma is seen from lords of dusthana 6, 8 and 12 from lag=\r\nna or 7th which is....you know this.There is nothing wrong with the 7th hou=\r\nse as it is necessary for procreation. It is only the link of this with the=\r\n Brahma graha that causes it to become a serious shad-ripu. Married people =\r\nare as eligible for moksha as unmarried ones and bachelors. It depends on t=\r\nhe following of dharma and ashrama.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Various gods bestow va=\r\nrious things on us, some at the gross physical level and some at the subtle=\r\n spiritual level. As we overcome our dependendency on gross things, we make=\r\n progress at the subtle level.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; If one eats food, a good am=\r\nount of internal fire (and subtle internal energy associated with it) is us=\r\ned for digesting it and for generating physical energy from it. If one fast=\r\ns, that subtle energy is unused and available for other things. This is a t=\r\nremendous benefit. As a result, one can better digest mantras and spiritual=\r\n food available all around one.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; The mantra one meditates w=\r\nith at the end of a day&#39;s fasting is far more effective than at other times=\r\n. The conservation of energy otherwise spent on digestion or speech will en=\r\nable far more effective mantra meditation. So fast or keep mouna and then m=\r\neditate with a mantra, to maximize the effect of the mantra.\n      &gt; \n     =\r\n &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] I do not agree with this. Correct eating is the best bles=\r\nsing for good mantra practise. On days when one fasts the mind is troubled =\r\nby hunger causing the stomach to burn and churn and this disturbs mantra ja=\r\npa. Correct eating (alpa aahaara) is many many times better than complete f=\r\nasting.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; However, to be honest, I have not heard this =\r\nabout 2nd lord and\n      &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tithi. The basic point is that Upapada is a=\r\n rashi and carries energy\n      &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of Vara or day. If you fast on the d=\r\nay ruled by tithi of the 2nd\n      &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lord, you are bringing the jala e=\r\nnergy to vara, and gandanta may\n      &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occur, and spouse may come int=\r\no a danger. So, what is the way out.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Why does a rashi carr=\r\ny the energy of vaara only and not that of the tithi???? Why does rashi rep=\r\nresent vaara or fire?\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] Because Raashi were c=\r\nreated by Surya and for doing so Surya took 12 forms called the Dvadasa Adi=\r\ntya...Narasimha you ask this?? What is happening?\n      &gt; \n      &gt; After al=\r\nl, Rudra rules over the element of fire and Gouri rules over the element of=\r\n water and one worships Gouri at the time of marriage. Moreover, Venus (wat=\r\ner) is the karaka for marriage. So one could even say that UL/marriage is r=\r\nepresented by water element and fasting on UL lord&#39;s tithi brings the eleme=\r\nnt of water (prosperity and well-being) to one&#39;s marriage (UL)? One could e=\r\nven say that fasting on the weekday of UL lord should be prohibited as it b=\r\nrings the fire element represented by weekday to the water of UL and causes=\r\n &quot;gandanta&quot;!\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] UL is the Maya and is associat=\r\ned with the Raashi Narasimha. It is the 12L which is the creator of the UL.=\r\n..just as the mother Gouri creates everything through the shakti of the gra=\r\nha, all the arudha are created by her due to the lordships of the planets. =\r\nSo fasting on the tithi lorded by the 12th lord will be a *more correct* an=\r\nswer.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Seriously, however, this kind of stretching of ganda=\r\nnta concepts is quite illogical.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] It is not =\r\nstretching ... it is the very definition of gandanta =E2=80=93 the interfac=\r\ne between fire and water. Put a burning match in a glass of water, the fire=\r\n dies...There are other Ganda=E2=80=99s in the chart but they are not anta =\r\n(ends). Take Chitra ganda between Kanya and Tula.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; Now one =\r\nmore thing: Marriage is a yoga between two souls and why not suggest fastin=\r\ng on the yoga day of the UL lord?\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] What! Wha=\r\nt a brilliant suggestion...why don=E2=80=99t you start it?  \n      &gt; \n     =\r\n &gt; * * *\n      &gt; \n      &gt; &gt; Now suppose instead of 11th house if Mercury go=\r\nes to 12th house or 4 \n      &gt; &gt; house then you cannot choose Dwadashi or C=\r\nhaturthi for the same \n      &gt; &gt; because these thithis are ruled by Mercury=\r\n only and fasting on these \n      &gt; &gt; tithis will create serious doshas.\n  =\r\n    &gt; \n      &gt; Picking tithi based on house (12th house - Dwadashi, 4th hou=\r\nse - Chaturthi) is illogical as there are 12 houses only and more tithis.\n =\r\n     &gt; I have realized one thing over the years - If something is not struc=\r\nturally sound, it is most likely false knowledge.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay =\r\nRath:] J No comments\n      &gt; \n      &gt; * * *\n      &gt; \n      &gt; I can categori=\r\ncally declare one thing with utmost confidence. You pick any weekday or tit=\r\nhi and take a vow to fast or do mouna vrata (remain silent) on that weekday=\r\n or tithi and meditate with a particular mantra (any) at the end of the day=\r\n. You can take a vow to keep that practice for a certain duration of time (=\r\nsay, a few months or years) for a specific purpose. Take a vow and keep the=\r\n vrata for the duration. If brahmacharya can be kept for the duration of th=\r\ne vrata, there is nothing like it!\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] This is =\r\na fine  statement but then you seem to be saying that the Puranas and other=\r\n teachings of the seers is of not much relevance. Of course you are right a=\r\ns it will be spiritually beneficial. For example, a person wishing to marry=\r\n should not fast on UL days and should choose any day (all days are the sam=\r\ne) or any tithi (all tithi are the same) and start fasting and do a mantra =\r\n(any mantra!!) and then in a few days, or (maybe) a few months (or maybe) a=\r\n few years ... or maybe (what you did not say), a few lifetimes, the marria=\r\nge will happen! I cannot say you are wrong, so I agree that what you say is=\r\n right.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; If you keep such a vrata sincerely, you will make =\r\npositive progress towards achieving your purpose and definitely not go back=\r\nwards, irrespective of what is said by technical calculations based on our =\r\nhalf-baked Jyotish knowledge.\n      &gt; \n      &gt; * * *\n      &gt; \n      &gt; My fr=\r\niends, use the Jyotish knowledge available, but do realize that it is imper=\r\nfect and corrupted. Why is only the UL lord important? So many planets may =\r\nhave so many kinds of influence on UL in a chart. And UL is one of several =\r\nfactors showing marriage. There may be various influences in a chart showin=\r\ng marriage. Is our thumb rule of using UL lord&#39;s weekday missing some impor=\r\ntant factors? Quite possible!\n      &gt; \n      &gt; [Sanjay Rath:] That is a ver=\r\ny nasty statement. Once again you have used adjectives (*imperfect, corrupt=\r\ned*) which is not becoming of you. Why must you use nasty statements?
