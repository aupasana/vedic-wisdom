If you have eaten more it will produc=\r\ne gas not sin. The gift of food is the best gift of all, please donate as m=\r\nuch as you can this time around as in this birth, because now you know abou=\r\nt food. There is no such thing as &quot;sin&quot;. When Narasimha wrote sin, he didn&#39;=\r\nt mean it in a traditional definition of sin. Bhavanaon ko samjho, angreji =\r\nko nahin. Un logon ko khana khilao jinko zaroorat hai. Aur bohton ko sach m=\r\nein hai!!\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Srilatha&quot; &lt;jvsrilatha@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sir, \n&gt; \n&gt; Is eating more than required instead of thro=\r\nwing the food also a sin?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Nara=\r\nsimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is an ag=\r\ne of growing populations and food shortages. A lot of \n&gt; &gt; people are starv=\r\ning without food to eat. As those who can afford food \n&gt; &gt; waste the limite=\r\nd food that is available, that jacks up food prices and \n&gt; &gt; makes it even =\r\nmore inaccessible to starving people. This is already a \n&gt; &gt; serious proble=\r\nm according to scientists and I am afraid will get much \n&gt; &gt; worse in comin=\r\ng decades.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Given this, wasting food is a really really really terr=\r\nible sin in \n&gt; &gt; today&#39;s times. Please don&#39;t waste food. This includes:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; (1) Cooking more food than you need and throwing it away,\n&gt; &gt; (2) Ser=\r\nving more food than you can eat in your plate and throwing it \n&gt; &gt; away\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n (3) Buying more vegetables/fruits than you need and letting them get \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nspoiled\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please treat Mother Annapurna (personification of food tha=\r\nt sustains us) \n&gt; &gt; with respect, love and humility (rather than arrogance,=\r\n contempt and \n&gt; &gt; pride). World (and we) needs her blessings and kindness.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On a similar note, some ladies do ri=\r\ntuals where chick peas soaked in \n&gt; &gt; water, fruits etc, sweets etc are dis=\r\ntributed to other ladies. I have \n&gt; &gt; seen so many ladies casually get thes=\r\ne food items, let them rot and then \n&gt; &gt; throw them away. The notion that g=\r\niving food to people is good karma is \n&gt; &gt; based on the assumption that the=\r\ny actually eat it or use otherwise. If \n&gt; &gt; they waste it, it is bad karma =\r\nfor both parties.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please do not accept any food that you cannot us=\r\ne. Also, don&#39;t \n&gt; &gt; distribute food to people who do not need it. Instead, =\r\nfeed homeless, \n&gt; &gt; needy people. Doing rituals with no common sense and ju=\r\nst for the heck \n&gt; &gt; of it, is not good. Such rituals produce no results wh=\r\natsoever. Blindly \n&gt; &gt; adhering to traditions that are doing no good really=\r\n, is like dressing a \n&gt; &gt; corpse in beautiful clothes and jewellery. Use co=\r\nmmon sense and do \n&gt; &gt; *real* good to others and the world, than engaging i=\r\nn fake *symbols* \n&gt; &gt; that in reality harm the world.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry for th=\r\ne strong language, but I do see many people abusing Mother \n&gt; &gt; Annapoorna =\r\nand I think this is terrible for the world. This needs to \n&gt; &gt; change.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; &gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Le=\r\nssons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homa=\r\nm and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;      =\r\n Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;    Jyotish wr=\r\nitings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;                  =\r\n     Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
