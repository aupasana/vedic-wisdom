Temples also close during the eclipse. H=\r\nowever, answer to your question is slightly nuanced.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Individualized c=\r\nonsciousness is a microcosm, while the external universe is the macrocosm. =\r\nThey correspond to each other. The external Sun and Moon correspond to the =\r\nindividual soul and mind in the microcosm. They are the eyes of the individ=\r\nualized consciousness, through which various objects in the field of dualit=\r\ny are &quot;seen&quot;. When they are closed, one is in samadhi and does not see the =\r\nobjects in the field of duality.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When Sun or Moon are eclipsed extern=\r\nally and do not shine, the individual soul or mind are weak and do not shin=\r\ne in the microcosm. Such times are conducive to activities that need the in=\r\ndividual soul and mind to be passive and silent, and unconducive to activit=\r\nes that need them to be active and alert.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one is doing rituals - j=\r\napam or homam or abhishekam or any ritual - for material purposes, then ind=\r\nividual consciousness needs to keep its eyes open to the field of duality, =\r\nseek some objects and reject some objects etc. So the eyes need to be wide =\r\nopen. Just as shooting an arrow (or a gun) at a target when there is a fly =\r\nin the eye and you cannot keep the eye open is a bad idea, times when Sun o=\r\nr Moon are eclipsed are unconducive to doing such sadhana aimed at material=\r\n results.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If the goal of one&#39;s sadhana is spiritual progress and self=\r\n-realization, then one is aiming to close the eyes of individualized consci=\r\nousness and stop seeing the objects in the field of duality. Then, eclipse =\r\ntime is very auspicious. Thus, japam or homam or other rituals conducted at=\r\n the time of an eclipse are very auspicious and can even put a nearly ready=\r\n sadhaka in samadhi. Practice any ritual you want to practice (e.g. homam t=\r\no your ishta) and then close your eyes, keep the back straight, stop all ph=\r\nysical movement and meditate on your ishta.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha=\r\n\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   =\r\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It You=\r\nrself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                 =\r\n  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http:=\r\n//SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ve=\r\ndic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWriti=\r\nngs\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; ---- puneetrph &lt;puneetrph@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Dear learned members,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Is it OK to perform abhishekam of shiv-lingam during an eclipse?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nPlease advise further.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
