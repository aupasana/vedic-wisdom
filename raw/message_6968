Recognising, &quot;I am That,&quot; why run\nar=\r\nound like someone in need? 3.3\n\nAfter hearing of oneself as pure consciousn=\r\ness and the supremely beautiful,\nis one to go on lusting after sordid sexua=\r\nl objects? 3.4\n\nWhen the sage has realised that he himself is in all beings=\r\n, and all beings\nare in him, it is astonishing that the sense of individual=\r\nity should be able\nto continue. 3.5\n\nIt is astonishing that a man who has r=\r\neached the supreme nondual state and\nis intent on the benefits of liberatio=\r\nn should still be subject to lust and\nin bondage to sexual activity. 3.6\n\nI=\r\nt is astonishing that one already very debilitated, and knowing very well\nt=\r\nhat its arousal is the enemy of knowledge, should still hanker after\nsensua=\r\nlity, even when approaching his last days. 3.7\n\nIt is astonishing that one =\r\nwho is unattached to the things of this world or\nthe next, who discriminate=\r\ns between the permanent and the impermanent, and\nwho longs for liberation, =\r\nshould still be afraid of liberation. 3.8\n\nWhether feted or tormented, the =\r\nwise man is always aware of his supreme\nself-nature and is neither pleased =\r\nnor disappointed. 3.9\n\nThe great-souled person sees even his own body in ac=\r\ntion as if it were\nsomeone else&#39;s, so how should he be disturbed by praise =\r\nor blame? 3.10\n\nSeeing this world as pure illusion, and devoid of any inter=\r\nest in it, how\nshould the strong-minded person, feel fear, even at the appr=\r\noach of death?\n3.11\n\nWho can be compared to the great-souled person whose m=\r\nind is free from\ndesire even in disappointment, and who has found satisfact=\r\nion in\nself-knowledge? 3.12\n\nHow should a strong-minded person who knows th=\r\nat what he sees is by its very\nnature nothing, consider one thing to be gra=\r\nsped and another to be rejected?\n3.13\n\nAn object of enjoyment that comes of=\r\n itself is neither painful nor\npleasurable for someone who has eliminated a=\r\nttachment, and who is free from\ndualism and from desire. 3.14\n\n\nAshtavakra =\r\nsaid:\n\nThe wise person of self-knowledge, playing the game of worldly enjoy=\r\nment,\nbears no resemblance whatever to samsara&#39;s bewildered beasts of burde=\r\nn. 4.1\n\nTruly the yogi feels no excitement even at being established in tha=\r\nt state\nwhich all the Devas from Indra down yearn for disconsolately. 4.2\n\n=\r\nHe who has known That is untouched within by good deeds or bad, just as\nspa=\r\nce is not touched by smoke, however much it may appear to be. 4.3\n\nWho can =\r\nprevent the great-souled person who has known this whole world as\nhimself f=\r\nrom living as he pleases? 4.4\n\nOf all four categories of beings, from Brahm=\r\na down to the last clump of\ngrass, only the man of knowledge is capable of =\r\neliminating desire and\naversion. 4.5\n\nRare is the man who knows himself as =\r\nthe nondual Lord of the world, and he\nwho knows this is not afraid of anyth=\r\ning. 4.6\n\n\nAshtavakra said:\n\nYou are not bound by anything. What does a pur=\r\ne person like you need to\nrenounce? Putting the complex organism to rest, y=\r\nou can find peace. 5.1\n\nAll this arises out of you, like a bubble out of th=\r\ne sea. Knowing yourself\nlike this to be but one, you can find peace. 5.2\n\nI=\r\nn spite of being in front of your eyes, all this, being insubstantial, does=\r\n\nnot exist in you, spotless as you are. It is an appearance like the snake =\r\nin\na rope, so you can find peace. 5.3\n\nEqual in pain and in pleasure, equal=\r\n in hope and in disappointment, equal in\nlife and in death, and complete as=\r\n you are, you can find peace. 5.4\n\n\nAshtavakra said:\n\nI am infinite like sp=\r\nace, and the natural world is like a jar. To know this\nis knowledge, and th=\r\nen there is neither renunciation, acceptance, or\ncessation of it. 6.1\n\nI am=\r\n like the ocean, and the multiplicity of objects is comparable to a\nwave. T=\r\no know this is knowledge, and then there is neither renunciation,\nacceptanc=\r\ne or cessation of it. 6.2\n\nI am like the mother of pearl, and the imagined =\r\nworld is like the silver. To\nknow this is knowledge, and then there is neit=\r\nher renunciation, acceptance,\nor cessation of it. 6.3\n\nAlternatively, I am =\r\nin all beings, and all beings are in me. To know this is\nknowledge, and the=\r\nn there is neither renunciation, acceptance, or cessation\nof it. 6.4\n\n\nJana=\r\nka said:\n\nIn the infinite ocean of myself the world boat drifts here and th=\r\nere, moved\nby its own inner wind. I am not put out by that. 7.1\n\nWhether th=\r\ne world wave of its own nature rises or disappears in the infinite\nocean of=\r\n myself, I neither gain nor lose anything by that. 7.2\n\nIt is in the infini=\r\nte ocean of myself that the mind-creation called the\nworld takes place. I a=\r\nm supremely peaceful and formless, and I remain as\nsuch. 7.3\n\nMy true natur=\r\ne is not contained in objects, nor does any object exist in it,\nfor it is i=\r\nnfinite and spotless. So it is unattached, desireless and at\npeace, and I r=\r\nemain as such. 7.4\n\nI am pure consciousness, and the world is like a magici=\r\nan&#39;s show. How could\nI imagine there is anything there to take up or reject=\r\n? 7.5\n\n\nAshtavakra said:\n\nBondage is when the mind longs for something, gri=\r\neves about something,\nrejects something, holds on to something, is pleased =\r\nabout something or\ndispleased about something. 8.1\n\nLiberation is when the =\r\nmind does not long for anything, grieve about\nanything, reject anything, or=\r\n hold on to anything, and is not pleased about\nanything or displeased about=\r\n anything. 8.2\n\nBondage is when the mind is tangled in one of the senses, a=\r\nnd liberation is\nwhen the mind is not tangled in any of the senses. 8.3\n\nWh=\r\nen there is no &quot;me,&quot; that is liberation, and when there is &quot;me&quot; there is\nbo=\r\nndage. Consider this carefully, and neither hold on to anything nor reject\n=\r\nanything. 8.4\n\n\nAshtavakra said:\n\nKnowing when the dualism of things done a=\r\nnd undone has been put to rest, or\nthe person for whom they occur has, then=\r\n you can here and now go beyond\nrenunciation and obligations by indifferenc=\r\ne to such things. 9.1\n\nRare indeed, my son, is the lucky man whose observat=\r\nion of the world&#39;s\nbehaviour has led to the extinction of his thirst for li=\r\nving, thirst for\npleasure, and thirst for knowledge. 9.2\n\nAll this is trans=\r\nient and spoiled by the three sorts of pain. Knowing it to\nbe insubstantial=\r\n, ignoble, and fit only for rejection, one attains peace.\n9.3\n\nWhen was tha=\r\nt age or time of life when the dualism of extremes did not exist\nfor men? A=\r\nbandoning them, a person who is happy to take whatever comes\nattains perfec=\r\ntion. 9.4\n\nWho does not end up with indifference to such things and attain =\r\npeace when\nhe has seen the differences of opinions among the great sages, s=\r\naints, and\nyogis? 9.5\n\nIs he not a guru who, endowed with dispassion and eq=\r\nuanimity, achieves full\nknowledge of the nature of consciousness, and leads=\r\n others out of samsara?\n9.6\n\nIf you would just see the transformations of t=\r\nhe elements as nothing more\nthan the elements, then you would immediately b=\r\ne freed from all bonds and\nestablished in your own nature. 9.7\n\nOne&#39;s desir=\r\nes are samsara. Knowing this, abandon them. The renunciation of\nthem is the=\r\n renunciation of it. Now you can remain as you are. 9.8\n\nSource: http://bha=\r\ngavan-ramana.org/ashtavakragita.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =\r\n=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016364ed8507c171704a8dd624d\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nAshtavakra said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Knowing=\r\n yourself as truly one and indestructible, how could a wise man possessing =\r\nself-knowledge like you feel any pleasure in acquiring wealth? 3.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nTruly, when one does not know oneself, one takes pleasure in the obj=\r\nects of mistaken perception, just as greed arises for the mistaken silver i=\r\nn one who does not know mother of pearl for what it is. 3.2&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All this=\r\n wells up like waves in the sea.
