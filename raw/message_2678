\n&gt; Sri Lakshmi Nrsimha Karaval=\r\namba stotra\n&gt; By\n&gt; Adi Sankara Bhagawat Pada\n&gt; \n&gt; Translated by\n&gt; P.R.Ramac=\r\nhander\n&gt; Introduction*\n&gt; &quot;Adi Sankara had once given his consent to a cruel=\r\n Kapalika to take his head and offer it as a sacrifice to Goddess Kali in o=\r\nrder to win favours from her. Kapalikas were followers of a particular Saiv=\r\na sect (the left-hand order) who always carried human skulls, wore them as =\r\ngarlands around their necks and even ate and drank from these macabre vesse=\r\nls. Lord Siva himself is hailed as Kapali. The Lord of the famous temple in=\r\n Mylapore in Chennai is worshipped as Kapaliswara; why is another story.\n&gt; =\r\nThis Kapalika had been nursing a grievance against Adi Sankara whom he view=\r\ned as a potential threat to his faith and sect. He took the Acharya to a ne=\r\narby cave, made necessary arrangements for the sacrifice-ritual and prepare=\r\nd himself to behead Adi Sankara. The Acharya was all along in a trance.\n&gt; H=\r\nowever, when the Kapalika lifted his sword and readied himself to chop off =\r\nhis head Sankara&#39;s disciple Padmapada (also known as Sanandana) envisioned =\r\nthis murderous scheme in his mind. He rushed to the cave in a trice. In an =\r\n&#39;avesa&#39; (possessed with divine powers) of Lord Narasimha he, verily, became=\r\n the man-lion Lord himself temporarily. He had attained Narasimha mantra si=\r\nddhi and, becoming frightfully ferocious, caught hold of the villainous Kap=\r\nalika and tore him to pieces.\n&gt; Sankara Vijaya, published by the Ramakrishn=\r\na Math in Chennai, describes how Padmapada leapt into the sky, scattering a=\r\nway the clouds with a slash of his mane, and literally flew into the cave, =\r\nstunning all beholders. It was a re-enactment of the Narasimha incarnation =\r\nonce again when the demon Hiranyakasipu was disembowelled by the Lord with =\r\nhis leonine claws.\n&gt; Adi Sankara, hearing the thunderous roars of a lion, a=\r\nwoke from his trance and witnessed the gory scene. Padmapada&#39;s body was sme=\r\nared with the blood of the vile Kapalika while his face glowed with divine =\r\nsplendour like a galaxy of suns. The Acharya saw before him the awesome Lor=\r\nd Narasimha himself and pacified him with soothing and overflowing devotion=\r\n.\n&gt; On another occasion, Adi Sankara&#39;s hands got burnt (the Amaruka episode=\r\n) but he was cured by extolling Lord Narasimha through the famous hyms, the=\r\n 17-verse Lakshmi Narasimha Karavalamba Stotram (also known as Lakshmi Nara=\r\nsimha Karunarasa Stotram&#39;). These hymns are so titled because each of these=\r\n verses ends with the same refrain &#39;Lakshmi Narasimha, mama dehi karavalamb=\r\nam&#39; (O Lord Narasimha, please lend me your helping hand).\n&gt; It is believed =\r\nthat fervent recitation of these hymns on Lord Narasimha (one of the two st=\r\notras Adi Sankara composed on Him) will always help one smoothly get over d=\r\nifficulties with the Lord&#39;s helping hand.\n&gt; Salagrama, the sacred stone fou=\r\nnd only in the Kandaki river in Nepal, and worshipped by Vaishnavites in th=\r\neir homes, is used in the puja of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam. This is said =\r\nto be specially sacred to Lord Narasimha and is believed to have been given=\r\n to Adi Sankara by Lord Narasimha himself.\n&gt; R Srinivasan &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; *This mast=\r\nerly introduction by Mr.R.Srivasan is taken from www.chennaionline. com\n&gt;

Kapalik=\r\nas were followers of a particular Saiva sect (the left-hand order) who alwa=\r\nys carried human skulls, wore them as garlands around their necks and even =\r\nate and drank from these macabre vessels. Lord Siva himself is hailed as Ka=\r\npali. The Lord of the famous temple in Mylapore in Chennai is worshipped as=\r\n Kapaliswara; why is another story.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This Kapalika had been nursing =\r\na grievance against Adi Sankara whom he viewed as a potential threat to his=\r\n faith and sect. He took the Acharya to a nearby cave, made necessary\n arra=\r\nngements for the sacrifice-ritual and prepared himself to behead Adi Sankar=\r\na. The Acharya was all along in a trance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, when the Kapalik=\r\na lifted his sword and readied himself to chop off his head Sankara&#39;s disci=\r\nple Padmapada (also known as Sanandana) envisioned this murderous scheme in=\r\n his mind. He rushed to the cave in a trice. In an &#39;avesa&#39; (possessed with =\r\ndivine powers) of Lord Narasimha he, verily, became the man-lion Lord himse=\r\nlf temporarily. He had attained Narasimha mantra siddhi and, becoming frigh=\r\ntfully ferocious, caught hold of the villainous Kapalika and tore him to pi=\r\neces.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sankara Vijaya, published by the Ramakrishna Math in Chennai,=\r\n describes how Padmapada leapt into the sky, scattering away the clouds wit=\r\nh a slash of his mane, and literally flew into the cave, stunning all behol=\r\nders. It was a re-enactment of the Narasimha incarnation once again when th=\r\ne demon Hiranyakasipu was disembowelled by the Lord with his\n leonine claws=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Adi Sankara, hearing the thunderous roars of a lion, awoke from h=\r\nis trance and witnessed the gory scene. Padmapada&#39;s body was smeared with t=\r\nhe blood of the vile Kapalika while his face glowed with divine splendour l=\r\nike a galaxy of suns. The Acharya saw before him the awesome Lord Narasimha=\r\n himself and pacified him with soothing and overflowing devotion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; O=\r\nn another occasion, Adi Sankara&#39;s hands got burnt (the Amaruka episode) but=\r\n he was cured by extolling Lord Narasimha through the famous hyms, the 17-v=\r\nerse Lakshmi Narasimha Karavalamba Stotram (also known as Lakshmi Narasimha=\r\n Karunarasa Stotram&#39;). These hymns are so titled because each of these vers=\r\nes ends with the same refrain &#39;Lakshmi Narasimha, mama dehi karavalambam&#39; (=\r\nO Lord Narasimha, please lend me your helping hand).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is believed=\r\n that fervent recitation of these hymns on Lord Narasimha (one of the two s=\r\ntotras Adi Sankara composed on Him) will always help\n one smoothly get over=\r\n difficulties with the Lord&#39;s helping hand.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Salagrama, the sacred s=\r\ntone found only in the Kandaki river in Nepal, and worshipped by Vaishnavit=\r\nes in their homes, is used in the puja of Sri Kanchi Kamakoti Peetam. This =\r\nis said to be specially sacred to Lord Narasimha and is believed to have be=\r\nen given to Adi Sankara by Lord Narasimha himself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; R Srinivasan &quot;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;
