It is not that I am \na dumb p=\r\nerson and will take whatever comes to me , I am a very hard \nworking person=\r\n but still the situation has arisen for me without my \ncontrol and myself a=\r\nnd soul has gone through those torterous years.&gt;\n\nYou are talking a lot abo=\r\nut Sade sati of Shani devta!  Obviously, \nyou have not read any of the Veda=\r\ns since we do not find any traces \nof these most dreaded planets viz. Manga=\r\nl and Shani in the Vedas or \nthe Vedanga Jyotisha or the Yajur Jyotisha!  N=\r\naturally, if Shani \nDevta is tormenting somebody it must be because that so=\r\nmebody is \ncalling sade sati a Vedic phenomenon, when actually it is a crea=\r\ntion \nof jyotishis themselves!\n\nHere is a challenge to all the &quot;Vedic&quot; and =\r\n&quot;non-Vedic&quot; and \neven &quot;anti-Vedic&quot; jyotihsis:  Let them quote even a single=\r\n mantra \nfrom any of the Vedas or a single shloka from any of the Puranas o=\r\nr \nany other shastra which has advised us to consult some soothsayer \nbefor=\r\ne embarking on any plan!\n\nAll the shastras, on the other hand, advise us &quot;k=\r\narmnayeva \nadhikaraste ma phaleshu kadachana&quot;---&quot;Do your duty but do not wo=\r\nrry \nabout the results&quot; whereas &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; wants us to do \nsome &quot;Upa=\r\ny&quot; to gain something whether we deserve it or not!\n\n&quot;Vedic astrology&quot; is th=\r\nus a drag on the society since there is \nnothing on record to show that it =\r\nhas done any good to the country:\n\nFor example, has any jyotishi till date =\r\nmade any prediction as to \nwhen a flood or Tsuname or some other disaster w=\r\nill strike which \npart of the country?  Has any jyotihsi predicted about th=\r\ne \ndevastating floods of Bihar, Orissa and other parts of the country?  \nHa=\r\ns any jyotishi predicted about terrorist attacks of Gujarat or \nDelhi or Ra=\r\njasthan?\n\nNo jyotishi had even the faintest idea about Messrs P V. Narasimh=\r\na \nRao or Dewe Gawda or I. K . Gujral being crowned the Heads of the \nlarge=\r\nst deemocracy of the world!  Same is the case with the present \nPM viz. Dr.=\r\n Manmohan Singh!  Of what use has &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; been \nabout deciding th=\r\ne course of events of the nation? \n\nLeave alone mundane affairs, the &quot;great=\r\nest Vedic astrologer of the \ntwentieth century&quot; had &quot;planned astrologically=\r\n&quot; to speak \non &quot;Astrology as an aid in the diaganosis of Heart diseases&quot; on=\r\n the \nthird January of the ensuing year but passed away himself on \nDecembe=\r\nr 20 of the year preceding the date of that talk and that \nalso of a &quot;heart=\r\n attack&quot;.  If he could not foresee his own death \nlooming large, how can th=\r\nese jyotishis help others in doing any \nfuture planning?\n\nIt maybe news to =\r\nyou that &quot;Vedic astrlogers&quot; can make correct \npredictios only from incorrec=\r\nt data---&quot;Notable Horscopes&quot; is the \nmost glaring example!  None of the cha=\r\nrts, including the horoscope \nof the &quot;redoubtable&quot; author himself in that b=\r\nook, has any correct \nastronomical data, but the author claims to have made=\r\n correct \nassessments!\n\nThe most tragic part of this farce known as &quot;Vedic =\r\nastrology&quot; is that\nwe will be celebrating Pitra-amavasya on the day of actu=\r\nal Dipavali \nwhich is September 28, 2008 as per all the shastras!  Is that =\r\nwhat \nour forefatehrs have advised us to do?  Is that what the real \nVamade=\r\nvas wanted us to do in the name of &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;, as is \nbeing claimed =\r\nby &quot;imported Vamadevas&quot; these days?  Will \nany &quot;imported Vamadeva&quot; celebrat=\r\ne his/her Christmas on any other day \nthan December 25? No.  Then whey are =\r\nthey compelling us to celebrate \nour festivals on wrong days---Uttarayana o=\r\nn January 15 instead of \nthe shortest day of the year and so on?  Obviously=\r\n, they have some \naxe to grind!\n\nWe are celebrating Dakshinayana on July 15=\r\n instead of the longest \nday of the year every year because &quot;Vedic astrolog=\r\ners&quot; and &quot;Vedic \npanchangakars&quot; advise us to do so!  Is that the real scien=\r\nce that is \nbeing advocated by &quot;Vedic astrologers&quot;?  Don&#39;t they know that t=\r\nhere \ncannot be any other Uttarayana except the shortest day of the year?  =\r\n\n\nThese &quot;Vedic astrologers&quot; want us to celebrate Vaishakhi on April 15 \nwhe=\r\nn actually Vasanta Sampat means the day when day is equal to \nnight!  What =\r\ndoes it show?  That &quot;Vedic astrologers&quot; do not know \neven ABC of school lev=\r\nel geogrpahy, leave alone astronomy!\n\nThus, I am against &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; =\r\nbecause it is the only &quot;branch \nof predictive gimmicks&quot; that compels us to =\r\ncelebrate all our \nfestivals and muhurtas on wrong days!  It is immaterial =\r\nto me \notherwise if somebody is making a fool of someone else in the name \n=\r\nof &quot;Vedic jyotish&quot; so long as the other someone is willing to become \na foo=\r\nl!  \n\nThe earlier the entire Hindu community wakes to this situation the \nb=\r\netter, as otherwise India will become Babylon of yesteryears, which \nis kno=\r\nwn as Iraq these days!  Maybe that is what the &quot;imported \nVamadevas&quot; actual=\r\nly want and it looks that they are also succeeding \nin their efforts!\nWith =\r\nregards,\nA K Kaul\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, uma shanker \n&lt;al=\r\niens19672004@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Mr Kaul\n&gt; \n&gt; It is nice to see that you have a=\r\n very exhaustive knowledge of \nvedas, upanishads and vast things that our r=\r\nishis have left for \nus.Read your exhaustive lecture on vedic astrology whi=\r\nch you have \nwritten what you have felt.

Good\n&gt; evening to everybody! \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI feel highly honoured\n&gt; to have been invited by Shri Ajay Bhasin for shari=\r\nng my views \nabout astrology\n&gt; and related topics with respected personalit=\r\nies assembled here.=A0 \nAs most\n&gt; of us already know, we call these predict=\r\nive gimmicks as &quot;Vedic\n&gt; astrology&quot; these days.=A0 =A0 \n&gt; \n&gt;  =A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; Whe=\r\nn I was asked by Shri\n&gt; Bhasin about the heading of my talk, I had thought =\r\nof making it \nas &quot;Vedic\n&gt; Astrology =96 the greatest fraud on the Vedas&quot;.=\r\n=A0 On second\n&gt; thoughts, fearing that it would be too explosive a heading,=\r\n I made \nit a sugar\n&gt; coated bitter pill by changing it to &quot;Do we celebrate=\r\n our \nfestivals on\n&gt; correct days?&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt;  =A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; Well, actually, both\n=\r\n&gt; i.e., the fraud known as &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; and &quot;our\n&gt; celebrating all our=\r\n festivals on wrong days&quot; are inter-related.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Let me start with\n&gt; &quot;Ve=\r\ndic astrology&quot;=A0 -=A0 as to why I call it a fraud! \n&gt; \n&gt; There is hardly a=\r\nnyone\n&gt; in India ,\n&gt; who does not want to know as to when his &quot;sade=96sati&quot;=\r\n will\n&gt; start or end or as to which Dasha-antardasha he is running and \nwhe=\r\nn that will\n&gt; end etc. etc.=A0even if he does not know ABC of jyotisha.=A0 =\r\nI have \ngone\n&gt; through all those pangs myself and made a thorough study of =\r\nall the\n&gt; astrological works besides a lot of astronomical books!=A0 I stud=\r\nied \nWestern\n&gt; system of astrology also and had become a sort of famous \nas=\r\ntrologer, though my\n&gt; predictions were as correct as anybody else&#39;s i.e. ha=\r\nrdly 50%.=A0\n&gt; However, this is a secret that no &quot;jyotishi&quot; shares with any=\r\nbody --\n&gt; that his/her predictions are hardly more correct than fifty per \n=\r\ncent, whatever\n&gt; logic or Ayanamsha he/she may use!=A0 When I analyzed the =\r\nreasons \nfor such a\n&gt; dismal rate of success, the conclusions were startlin=\r\ng!=A0 And I am \nkeeping\n&gt; those very conclusions before you! \n&gt; \n&gt;  =A0 \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Before proceeding\n&gt; further, I must, however, say something about myself=\r\n since you are \nwell within\n&gt; your rights to ask me as to what &quot;qualificati=\r\nons&quot; I have to\n&gt; demolish=A0 astrology that is being practised over the las=\r\nt several\n&gt; centuries, nay even millennia! \n&gt; \n&gt;  =A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; My\n&gt; credential=\r\ns Though I am not laying any claims\n&gt; to being a scholar, however, I have a=\r\nctually studied all the four \nVedas in\n&gt; original &quot;archaic&quot; Sanskrit with t=\r\nheir different\n&gt; &quot;Bhashyas&quot;, besides the various Brahmanas=A0 like Shatapat=\r\nha,\n&gt; Aitreya, Tatiriya etc. etc. I have studied, (in original \nSanskrit!) =\r\nabout two\n&gt; hundred all the important Upanishads as well! I have also gone =\r\n\nthrough both the\n&gt; epics viz. the Valmiki Ramayana and the Mahabharata ---=\r\n in=A0 \nSanskrit and\n&gt; from cover to cover, besides Adhyatma Ramayana, Rama=\r\ncharitamanasa \netc. etc.!\n&gt; There is hardly any Purana whether the Bhagavat=\r\na, Shivapurana, \nVishnu, Narada,\n&gt; Devi, Varaha, Matsya and Vishnudharmotar=\r\na etc. etc. that I have \nnot gone\n&gt; through in original Sanskrit. I have al=\r\nso studied exhaustively all \nthe ancient\n&gt; astronomical works like the Veda=\r\nnga Jyotisha, Panchasidhantika, \nSurya Sidhanta,\n&gt; Arya Bhati, Sidhanta Shi=\r\nromani etc. etc. To crown it all, I was \nnot a born\n&gt; renegade against the =\r\nestablished traditions.=A0 On the other hand, I \nwas\n&gt; initially &quot;hypnotize=\r\nd&quot; by &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; and\n&gt; &quot;panchangas&quot; myself and there is hardly any &quot;=\r\ntext-book&quot;\n&gt; of astrology either in Sanskrit or Urdu or English or Hindi th=\r\nat I \nhave not\n&gt; studied with due reverence, as if I was studying the Vedas=\r\n!  \n&gt; \n&gt;  =A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; Having established my\n&gt; credentials thus, I CAN DECLARE=\r\n IT WITHOUT ANY HESITATION AND WITH \nALL \n&gt; THE EMPHASIS AT MY COMMAND, =A0=\r\nTHAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PREDICTIVE\n&gt; ASTROLOGY IN ANY OF THE VEDAS, UPA=\r\nNISHADAS OR BRAHMANAS. There \nare, however,\n&gt; some references to some odd t=\r\nypes of predictions in some of the \nPuranas and the\n&gt; epics and therefore c=\r\nalling it as really a post-Vedic astrology is \nmore\n&gt; correct.=A0 There is =\r\na rider there also, and that is that according \nto these\n&gt; scriptures, Maka=\r\nra Sankranti i.e. Pongal is nothing but a synonym \nof Uttarayana\n&gt; (the sho=\r\nrtest day of the year) i.e. Winter Solstice and as \neverybody knows, it\n&gt; c=\r\nan take place these days only on or around December 21 every \nyear.=A0 Thus=\r\n\n&gt; the Uttarayana-cum- Makar Sankranti that we are celebrating now-a-\ndays =\r\non\n&gt; January 14 is absolutely wrong and does not have any authority \nfrom a=\r\nny shastra\n&gt; or even modern astronomy.=A0 Similarly, the Vaishakhi that is =\r\nbeing\n&gt; celebrated on April 14 or so also is wrong since Mesha Sankranti \ni=\r\ns nothing but\n&gt; Vishuva (Vernal Equinox) or Vasant Sampat and it cannot tak=\r\ne place \non any\n&gt; =A0day other than March 21/22, when the day and night are=\r\n equal. \nActually\n&gt; these Makara etc. sankrantis were known as Tapah etc. m=\r\nonths \nduring the Vedic\n&gt; period as there are no rashis in the Vedas but ju=\r\nst six seasons \nand Madhu,\n&gt; Madhava etc. twelve months.=A0 As such, we are=\r\n celebrating all our \nfasts,\n&gt; fairs and muhurtas on wrong days=A0 -- thank=\r\ns to &quot;Vedic\n&gt; astrologers&quot;=A0 and their &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  =A0 \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; =A0The first and\n&gt; foremost thing I learnt from our shastras is that no s=\r\nystem of \npredictions has\n&gt; any sanction=A0 either from the Vedas=A0 or eve=\r\nn Puranas least of all \nour\n&gt; dharmashastras etc.=A0since all our shastras =\r\nadmonish us from \nconsulting\n&gt; &quot;nakshatra jeevis&quot; so much so that the Manus=\r\nmriti calls these\n&gt; nakshatrasoochis as outcastes and not fit to sit in any=\r\n sabha of \nlearned\n&gt; people. \n&gt; \n&gt; Those\n&gt; who can foresee our future do no=\r\nt reveal it to us beforehand: \n&gt; \n&gt; All the Ramayanas,\n&gt; whether Valmiki or=\r\n Adhyatma or Ramacharitamanasa etc. etc. say \nthat before\n&gt; deciding about =\r\nthe coronation of Bhagwan Rama, Dashratha wanted \nhis guru\n&gt; Vasishtha to c=\r\nonfirm the suitable muhurta for that function.=A0 It \nwas on\n&gt; the advice o=\r\nf =A0Vasishtha Muni that Dasharatha decided to anoint \nRama as\n&gt; the Yuvraj=\r\na the very next day, as it was &quot;Tishya&quot; =A0i.e. Pushya\n&gt; nakshata then.=A0 =\r\nFrom this anecdote, it is clear that either \nVasishtha Muni\n&gt; did not know =\r\nas to what was going to happen to Dasharatha by \ndeclaring Bhagwan\n&gt; Rama a=\r\ns a crown-prince or Vasishtha kept quiet deliberately since \nhe did not\n&gt; w=\r\nant to interfere in the divine dispensation!

Aleberuni, who visit=\r\ned India in 1030 AD \nand =A0recorded quite\n&gt; faithfully all his experiences=\r\n about Jyotisha and other things in \nIndia \n&gt; also has not mentioned anythi=\r\nng of any &quot;Melapak&quot; in his work! \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;All\n&gt;  India \n&gt; Calendar Reform Com=\r\nmittee&quot;: \n&gt; \n&gt; Summing up, as we have\n&gt; just seen, not only are we subjecte=\r\nd to non-existent fear \npsychosis like\n&gt; Kalasarpa Dosha and Patri Melapak =\r\netc. but we are compelled to \ncelebrate all\n&gt; our festivals on worng days.=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0There are quite\n&gt; a few people who agree with my point of=\r\n view that these days we \nare celebrating\n&gt; Pitra Amavasya on the day of Di=\r\npavali and marriages during Pitra-\nPaksha!=A0\n&gt; Similarly, we never celebra=\r\nte Makar Sankranti on correct days i.e. \nDecember\n&gt; 21/22 but we celebrate =\r\nit on January 14.=A0 We also celebrate \nVaishakhi on\n&gt; April 14 instead of =\r\nthe day of Spring Equinox i.e., March 21 or \nso.=A0 This\n&gt; has been all bec=\r\nause of the so called &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; \n&gt; \n&gt; To put our festivals\n&gt; back o=\r\nn the right track, I made quite a few representations to the\n&gt; Hon&#39;ble Pres=\r\nident of India, the Prime Minister of India, various \nministries\n&gt; besides =\r\nthe Positional Astronomy Centre at Calcutta , who publish \nour Rashtriya\n&gt; =\r\nPanchanga.=A0 I also made similar representations to all the reverred\n&gt; Sha=\r\nnkaracharyas of all the six peethas,\n&gt; besides other saints and Mahatmas, b=\r\nut sorry to say, there has \nbeen absolutely\n&gt; no response from any quarter!=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; We=A0 have now formed\n&gt; an &quot;All India Calendar Reform Committee&quot; and=\r\n are enrolling members\n&gt; for the same.=A0 Those interested can log on to ht=\r\ntp://groups. \nyahoo.com/ group/HinduCalen dar\n&gt; =A0for entering into discus=\r\nsions regarding the same.=A0 You can also \nget\n&gt; a list of correct dates of=\r\n festivals for 2006 and 2007 from that \nforum. As an\n&gt; alternative, you can=\r\n get in touch with me whenever you want to for \nany further\n&gt; clarification=\r\ns. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you very much for\n&gt; listening to this &quot;exhortation&quot; against =\r\n&quot;Vedic\n&gt; astrology&quot; and the efforts I am making to streamline our\n&gt; calenda=\r\nrs.=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0\n&gt; Om tat sat brah=\r\nmarpanam astu \n&gt; \n&gt; Avtar\n&gt; Krishen Kaul \n&gt; \n&gt; President  \n&gt; \n&gt; All India C=\r\nalendar Reform Committee \n&gt; \n&gt; H.
