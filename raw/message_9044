This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges o=\r\nf energy in the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of ku=\r\nndalini until her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We =\r\nhave not been able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests no=\r\nrmal)- so it might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people w=\r\ne call mentally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or un=\r\nwanted spontaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and res=\r\nearch into this topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patient=\r\ns are not well-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments=\r\n for deranged kundalini, we struggle to help them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many yogis try to f=\r\norcibly waken the kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feel=\r\ning that kundalini should not be forcibly wakened.

May I request that the good samaritans among you pray for=\r\n her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering re=\r\nally is pitiable. \n&gt; \n&gt; And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to e=\r\nnd up in this situation ourselves.

This woman wants to kill=\r\n herself at times because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad.=\r\n She feels it will consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I wondered what solution there could be to her problem. The logical=\r\n one was to pray to the Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to re=\r\nlieve the suffering of this woman- and either cure her, or give her the str=\r\nength to bear this. May I request that the good samaritans among you pray f=\r\nor her, and for others like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering =\r\nreally is pitiable. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And let us be careful in our sadhana so as not =\r\nto end up in this situation ourselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga=\r\n is the safest. It is perhaps safest to say &quot;let me be your\n instrument&quot; an=\r\nd leave the kundalini rising bit to God&#39;s will.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Om Dum Durgayai Nama=\r\nha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Aparna &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/bl=\r\nockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;!-- end group em=\r\nail --&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--Apple-Mail-816056B0-6306-4D24-858A-9A9F16D0773C--\r\n\n"}}
