This is of great=\r\n importance because it can be shown to crictics who comment nastily on Kris=\r\nhna-Gopi relationship and also its for us to undersatnd and appreciate, atl=\r\neast intellectually.\n\nWhen i read such marvel from you, i try hard to contr=\r\nol myself not to be appreciative but i fail some times.\n\nAs you reprimanded=\r\n me in a different message, I will try to control *Flamboyance* (though whe=\r\nn i praise, it&#39;s always genuine and never sycophancy) and try to keep quite=\r\n, however with your blessings, Sadhana goes on mostly continuously.\n\n***\nOn=\r\ne more important thing to Share:\nI&#39;ve noticed since few days or may be a co=\r\nuple of weeks, a unique thing- I use a normal drinking water in my Chandi H=\r\nomam. at the end of homam i take a little water out of the copper container=\r\n as &quot;Prasaad&quot; and it really tests very different. It tests like a rose flav=\r\noured water (Like Gulaabjala). i could notice it but then i thought it woul=\r\nd be my mental creation. It is to be noticed that i do not use Flowers many=\r\n a times now. i just offer Akshatas as substitutes.\nNow yesterday, a small =\r\nboy of 8 years age was also present in the Homam. after Homam when i gave l=\r\nittle of the water to everybody including him, he immediately said that the=\r\n water is testing like a Rose flavoured and 2 more people presetnt in the H=\r\nomam also said the same thing and then i thought that i was right in feelin=\r\ng difference in the water. Though there may be science which can exlain thi=\r\ns but one thing for sure that the water after homam is transformed and test=\r\ns and smells also very very nice. (Yesterday also there were no flowers)\n\nB=\r\nest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR R=\r\nao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. Regarding Krishna and gopis:\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; The love of gopis for Krishna is not physical. Gopis were re-incarnations=\r\n of blessed beings from higher lokas (realms of consciousness) and were ins=\r\ntinctively drawn to Krishna as they were aware that Krishna was the perfect=\r\ned being. They had perfect surrender to the perfected being and aspired for=\r\n his company always.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The story of vastraapaharana (Krishna stealing t=\r\nhe clothes of gopis from the riverbank while they were bathing in the river=\r\n and forcing them to come out of the river without clothes) explains comple=\r\nte surrender and has an esoteric meaning. The sensual overtones some may pe=\r\nrceive in the story are an unfortunate side effect of the overly sensualize=\r\nd society we live in.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let me talk about the=\r\n esoteric meaning.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Gopi literally means the shakti that has control o=\r\nver the cows. Cows and horses in RigVeda symbolize the jnanendriyas and kar=\r\nmendriyas respectively. After all, this is the meaning in &quot;Sri Sooktam&quot; als=\r\no, where we encounter &quot;ashvadaayI ca godaayI&quot;, though that line has been su=\r\nperficially interpreted by scholars as &quot;one who gives cows and horses&quot;. Ext=\r\nolling Sri Maha Lakshmi as the giver of two specific kinds of cattle would =\r\nbe too frivolous for RigVeda, which represents the timeless and uncreated a=\r\nbsolute knowledge rather than relative knowledge bound by space and time. T=\r\nhe true meaning is that our jnanendriyas and karmendriyas come into being a=\r\nnd operate through the shakti of the Mother. Anyway, let us go back to gopi=\r\ns.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Within us, gopis represent the control o=\r\nver the senses. Control of various kinds over the senses will restrict the =\r\nsense activity and safeguard one&#39;s purity. But, merely by controlling or re=\r\nstricting the senses, one cannot reach god or merge in god. The goal of the=\r\n shaktis that represent control over senses is to merge in the Infinite. Th=\r\nat is what the desire of gopis to be with Krishna represents.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Clothes=\r\n represent conditioning with gunas. Even as one controls/restricts sense ac=\r\ntivity, there may be pride about it and several other types of conditioning=\r\n that colors the control exerted over sense activity. That is what the clot=\r\nhes of gopis represent! Gopis going to Krishna without clothes represents p=\r\nride and other conditioning being withdrawn from one&#39;s control over senses,=\r\n one&#39;s self-control becoming pure and devoid of ANY conditioning and then m=\r\nerging in the Supreme.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As I said, the sensual overtones some may perc=\r\neive in the story are an unfortunate side effect of the overly sensualized =\r\nsociety we live in.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regarding all people be=\r\ning women and the Supreme being a man:\n&gt;  \n&gt; This is also an esotetic conce=\r\npt and not physical or sensual in nature.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In this universe, masculine=\r\n spirit represents the potential energy and feminine spirit represents the =\r\nkinetic energy. Supreme Cosmic Being or Parama Purusha exists as the potent=\r\niality behind the entire universe. He is the potential energy. Shakti or th=\r\ne kinetic energy that is running the show in this entire universe manifests=\r\n in each person as his/her Kundalini shakti. It is through the Kundalini sh=\r\nakti that one is aware of the universe and acts in it. One&#39;s awareness of t=\r\nhe world is colored by one&#39;s conditioning. As Kundalini shakti awakens, ris=\r\nes, purifies herself and drops off all conditioning that colors one&#39;s self-=\r\nawareness, it will rise to sahasrara and has a union with Parama Purusha. I=\r\nnstead of being aware of oneself as a limited object that perceives and int=\r\neracts with so many other objects, one then is absorbed in an awareness of =\r\nthe Supreme Potentiality of the entire universe. Kundalini shakti (one&#39;s se=\r\nlf-awareness) is symbolically represented as a female deity. She awakens (o=\r\nne starts to search for true self), purifies herself, sheds her clothing (c=\r\nonditioning that colors one&#39;s self-awareness) and ultimately has a union wi=\r\nth the supreme being in sahasrara.\n&gt;  \n&gt; All this is symbolic and esoteric =\r\nin meaning. Any sensuality one perceives in this depiction is simply due to=\r\n the conditioning of one&#39;s mind.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; [Warning: =\r\nSome raw and uninhibited language in the remainder of this mail MAY offend =\r\nsome sensitive and conservative readers.]\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. Regarding references to =\r\nbody parts:\n&gt;  \n&gt; There is nothing inherently &quot;titillating&quot; in a breast or =\r\nother body parts. When a baby sees the breast, for example, the baby thinks=\r\n of milk and nourishment. There are no other thoughts in the baby&#39;s mind!\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; Our problems and weaknesses do not lie in external objects. They lie i=\r\nn our own minds. When one sees a luxury car, one can just appreciate its el=\r\negance, power and beauty and leave it at that. One need not think, &quot;I must =\r\nsomehow have this car&quot; or imagine what one can do if one has that car. When=\r\n one sees a briefcase containing one million dollars, one can just apprecia=\r\nte that it is a lot of money and a lot of things can be bought with it. One=\r\n need not think, &quot;I must somehow have this money&quot; or imagine what one can d=\r\no if one has that money. Similarly, when one sees a breast, one can just ap=\r\npreciate its ability to nurture new life. One need not imagine what one can=\r\n do with it. When one sees a vagina, one can just appreciate it as the sour=\r\nce of new life.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Unfortunately, ego and cond=\r\nitioning make one think unnecessary thoughts about every object perceived b=\r\ny senses. Ego and mental conditioning make one introduce oneself mentally i=\r\nn the middle of all objects perceived by senses and engage in mental action=\r\ns with those objects. Those mental actions are of course shaped by one&#39;s ow=\r\nn conditioning! THAT is the problem. The over-materialization and over-sexu=\r\nalization prevalent in our society makes the conditioning deeper and more d=\r\nifficult to shake off. But the goal of sadhana is to shake off all conditio=\r\nning.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; When an evolved yogi sees a beautiful=\r\n naked body, he need not close eyes and run away. He need not feel uncomfor=\r\ntable or embarrassed or self-conscious when looking at or talking about it.=\r\n There is nothing inherently wrong or sinful in a naked body. It is not an =\r\nobject of lust by itself, though it may seem like an object of lust to a mi=\r\nnd conditioned with lust. Even if such a conditioned person takes sannyasa =\r\nand remains in a forest for 30 years away from everybody, he may feel lust =\r\nif he suddenly sees a beautiful naked body after those 30 years of brahmach=\r\narya. On the other hand, when an evolved yogi who overcame this conditionin=\r\ng sees a beautiful naked body, he may not close eyes and run away. He may n=\r\notice its beauty (just like one may notice the beauty of a roadside scenery=\r\n or waterfall or snowfall over a mountain or a sunrise over a lake etc) and=\r\n appreciate the Creator for creating objects of infinite variety and beauty=\r\n. Thoughts of lust (e.g. I can do so and so thing with this body, it will b=\r\ne nice to do so and so thing with this body, etc) may not even arise in his=\r\n mind!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, when one is lustful, the best thing to do is to kee=\r\np oneself away from objects that provoke lust. But the final goal is to rea=\r\nch the above state.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; When you encounter refe=\r\nrences of body parts in ancient devotional literature, you should realize t=\r\nhat those authors had overcome lust and were childlike. Talking of a breast=\r\n or navel would not make them lustful or uncomfortable or embarrassed. Ther=\r\ne was no difference between talking about a breast or a navel that they saw=\r\n and talking about a scenery or a waterfall or snowfall over a mountain or =\r\nsunrise over a lake that they saw.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When a goddess revealed herself to=\r\n them, there was no need to cover her breasts. Clothes represent covering b=\r\ny additional conditioning and gunas. If goddess revealed herself to one wit=\r\nh more conditioning, there was a need for more clothes, jewellery etc. If g=\r\noddess revealed herself to a childlike one with no conditioning, unconditio=\r\nned raw form is just fine. After all, a woman may feel comfortable standing=\r\n naked in front of a baby, while she will cover herself properly when comin=\r\ng in front of a twenty year old son whose mind looks at things differently.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bottomline: Those yogis and authors were u=\r\nnconditioned by lust and were shown what they were ready to see and they de=\r\nscribed what they saw. Moreover, everything has a symbolic meaning too. How=\r\never, if you are teaching a young and conditioned mind, I&#39;d suggest not tea=\r\nching verses that can appear to be explicit or provocative. It is easy to m=\r\nisunderstand or get erotic thoughts in the mind, though that is not the int=\r\nention of the author. After all, let me give an analogy. Suppose seeing any=\r\nthing red makes a person remember a bloodbath one saw earlier, become enrag=\r\ned and go and kill the enemies. Suppose you have a picture of abhishekam of=\r\n a Lalita idol with kumkum (sacred red vermillion powder). You better not s=\r\nhow the picture to that person..\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyot=\r\nish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do I=\r\nt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;            =\r\n         http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;        Films that make a differen=\r\nce: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;        Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;     Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nJyotishWritings\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nagraj@&quot; &lt;nagraj=\r\n_um@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste all learned friends, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have a few qu=\r\nestions for which I am sincerely seeking answers. The questions pertain to =\r\nMathura Bhakti tradition as well as some very popular works of great sages =\r\nand saints of our beloved Bharata Varsha. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. There is this tradit=\r\nion of envisioning the lord (paramatma) as the only purusha and all the hum=\r\nanity (various jeevatmas) as women and thereby jeevatmas seeking union with=\r\n paramatma culminating in salvation. We have seen examples of great saints =\r\nlike Chaitanya Maha Prabhu who were stalwarts of this path. And this explai=\r\nns the Krishna tatva in Srimad bhagavatam as well in gopika vastra apaharan=\r\na / rasaleela episodes. While I think I understand this concept very well, =\r\nI find it very hard to explain it 1. To someone who is foreign to our cultu=\r\nre and 2. To people who intentionally malign the image of our rich Vedic tr=\r\naditions and 3. To kids who might come up with questions on this subject. W=\r\nhat is the best way to explain it in these situations? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. In Lali=\r\ntha Sahasranama stotra as well as Saundarya Lahari stotra, Veda Vyasa and A=\r\ndi Sankara respectively have described the mother goddess in a very detaile=\r\nd way detailing on specific body parts. Yes, undoubtedly they have envision=\r\ned the formless nirguna Brahman as their beloved mother, but where from is =\r\nthis tradition anga-anga varnana (part - by part description) of mother? Wh=\r\nile I have no problem in accepting those and include those in my daily pray=\r\ners, how do we sensibly / convincingly explain these to the above groups of=\r\n people? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Not only in these, I find reference to woman&#39;s body part=\r\ns quite liberally in most of the ancient sanskrit / telugu literature and I=\r\n want to know why? Examples are Sri Krishna Ashtakam, Venkateshwara stotra =\r\nthat follows soon after Suprabhata (kamala kucha choochuka kumkumatO ....) =\r\nand so on. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Pardon me if I am sounding naive... But having to teac=\r\nh some of these to a teenage kid... I really do not know how to approach, i=\r\nn case of any questions! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nagraj\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
