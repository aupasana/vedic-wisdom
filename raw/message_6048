During the last five days do 4000 dai=\r\nly. Get up at 4.00 a.m. Write down in a thin paper Rama Nama 3000 times. Th=\r\nen cut the paper into small pieces. Each piece will contain one Rama Nama. =\r\nThen roll it with a small ball of Atta (wheat flour paste). Writing will ta=\r\nke two or three hours according to your strength and capacity. Then you wil=\r\nl have to cut one by one. You will have to do the whole process by sitting =\r\non one Asana. If you will find it difficult to sit on one Asana you can hav=\r\ne change of Asana. But you should not leave your seat. Some use a special i=\r\nnk made up of saffron, musk, camphor, etc., and a special writing pen made =\r\nup of sharp pointed thin Tulasi stick. You can use ordinary ink and pen if =\r\nyou cannot get the above special ink and special pen. You will have to do A=\r\nnushthana on the bank of the Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari, Kaveri or Narmada, at=\r\n Rishikesh, Varanasi, Haridwar or Prayag. You can do it at home, if you fin=\r\nd it difficult to come to these places. Take milk and fruit or Phalahar dur=\r\ning these days. Throw the ball in the Ganga or any river for fishes. You wi=\r\nll develop wonderful patience. You will get divine grace.\n\nStudy the whole =\r\nRamayana 108 times with purity and concentration. This can be done in three=\r\n years if you can devote three hours daily. You can go through the whole bo=\r\nok three times in a month. You will acquire Siddhis. You will have Darshan =\r\nof Lord Rama.\n\n\n"}}
