Houseless, bereft of the sacred fire, desireless=\r\n, indifferent and speechless, he should maintain perfect equanimity. Life a=\r\nnd death he must not court; like a servant waiting for the receipt of his s=\r\nalary he must patiently wait for the time of emancipation.\n\nAlways contempl=\r\nating on Brahman, non-attached to anything of the world, and desiring nothi=\r\nng both here and hereafter, he should, in the company of his Self alone, ro=\r\nam about in the world, for the bliss of emancipation. He should court peace=\r\n and live in peace, for peace is bliss, and peace is his ideal.\n\nVessels ma=\r\nde of gourds, wood, earth or bamboo, should be used by the fourth order of =\r\nascetics . After the hearths of the householders have ceased to emit smoke,=\r\n after pestles and mortars have been laid aside for the day, after the hear=\r\nth-fires have been extinguished, after the householders have all taken thei=\r\nr meals, and plates with leavings have been cast away, then should an ascet=\r\nic (sannyasin) stroll out for alms, each day in the afternoon. \n\n\n"}}
