Purely my own observations. Not point=\r\ns of debate. Everyone is free to disagree.\n\n1st stage of Sadhana: Try out s=\r\ncoops of everything, hanging on to solicited or unsolicited advice from any=\r\nwhere and everwhere, and eventually moving in confused circles, feeling pro=\r\nud and happy about the fact that, yes I am doing something called sadhana w=\r\nhile many others are not. The mind lies in the communal stage (communal =3D=\r\n anyone one who mentally identifies to a community not necessarily in a rel=\r\nigious sense), trying to find a community of similar minded individuals and=\r\n hang on to the same in a subconscious attempt to define itself.\n\n2nd stage=\r\n of Sadhana: Get bits and pieces of &quot;experiences&quot; in an external format whi=\r\nch the mind correlates to the process of sadhana and either feels happy, or=\r\n dejected. Soon it gets boring, for none of these so called external &quot;exper=\r\niences&quot; are consistent or even replicable at will. Doubts start creeping, b=\r\noredom sets in, confusions galore, and some fall back to stage 1 described =\r\nabove.\n\n3rd stage: One realizes the absolute futility of the external exper=\r\niences compared to what is happening inside, if at all anything is happenin=\r\ng. Until a transformation process triggers inside the mind, all of it is me=\r\naningless. The external world may crack open and 33 millions deities may da=\r\nnce infornt, yet it eventually counts for nothing if it is not able to stil=\r\nl the &quot;monkey-mind&quot; and make the sadhaka enjoy a concentrated feeling of in=\r\nternal joy. This joy will overflow into other secular activities and though=\r\nts, it&#39;s so powerful and dynamic in nature. One who is firmly established i=\r\nn this stage, will never bother too much about the external ritual, its sou=\r\nrce, its accuracy etc. He/she does not shun external rituals, but he/she re=\r\nalizes that the real barometer for judging the efficacy of a sadhana is ins=\r\nide the mind and heart. This is the beginning of the &quot;alone&quot; phase. Alone, =\r\nbut not lonely. In loneliness one craves for external validation, in being =\r\nalone one needs no validation apart from his/her own joy.\n\nAs such, if this=\r\n person were to meet another sadhaka, the only worthy information he/she wi=\r\nll try to extract is what has the other person experienced internally, and =\r\nbe least bothered about what path he/she walks and which deity he/she is tr=\r\nying to worship. Fancy names and theoretical classifications do not impress=\r\n him/her anymore.\n\nFrom here starts the real journey. Before that, stage 1 =\r\nand stage 2 is like a kindergarten attitude. So each sadhaka must ask himse=\r\nlf/herself objective, where does he/she stand and where is he/she headed!\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
