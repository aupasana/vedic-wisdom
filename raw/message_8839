The scientific know=\r\nledge of the rishis was very great; in the KAUSHITAKI BRAHMANA we find prec=\r\nise astronomical passages which show that in 3100 B.C. the Hindus were far =\r\nadvanced in astronomy, which had a practical value in determining the auspi=\r\ncious times for astrological ceremonies. \n\nIn an article in EAST;WEST, Febr=\r\nuary, 1934, the following summary is given of the JYOTISH or body of Vedic =\r\nastronomical treatises: &quot;It contains the scientific lore which kept India a=\r\nt the forefront of all ancient nations and made her the mecca of seekers af=\r\nter knowledge. The very ancient BRAHMAGUPTA, one of the JYOTISH works, is a=\r\nn astronomical treatise dealing with such matters as the heliocentric motio=\r\nn of the planetary bodies in our solar system, the obliquity of the eclipti=\r\nc, the earth&#39;s spherical form, the reflected light of the moon, the earth&#39;s=\r\n daily axial revolution, the presence of fixed stars in the Milky Way, the =\r\nlaw of gravitation, and other scientific facts which did not dawn in the We=\r\nstern world until the time of Copernicus and Newton.&quot;\n\nIt is now well;known=\r\n that the so;called &quot;Arabic numerals,&quot; without whose symbols advanced mathe=\r\nmatics is difficult, came to Europe in the 9th century, via the Arabs, from=\r\n India, where that system of notation had been anciently formulated. Furthe=\r\nr light on India&#39;s vast scientific heritage will be found in Dr. P. C. Ray&#39;=\r\ns HISTORY OF HINDU CHEMISTRY, and in Dr. B. N. Seal&#39;s POSITIVE SCIENCES OF =\r\nTHE ANCIENT HINDUS.\n\n*** Extracts from: Autobiography of a Yogi - by Paramh=\r\nansa Yogananda, 16th Chapter: Outwitting the Stars ***\n\n\n\n"}}
