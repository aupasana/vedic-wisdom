In the beginning, one may start with blind faith, but \neventually one h=\r\nas to know by experience. Otherwise, it is not of much \nuse. The problem in=\r\n the world right now is that there are many relgions \nled by people who hav=\r\ne not experienced god in any manner and yet leading \npeople. This has resul=\r\nted in people fighting and killing in the name of \ngod.\n\n*        *        =\r\n*\n\nAnyway, coming back to your question, I did not say planetary kavachas \n=\r\nare a much. In fact, I said Chandi kavacham and Narayana kavacham are \nbett=\r\ner for most people. In fact, any prayer can protect one, if one does \nwith =\r\nenough intensity for enough duration.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI never said or=\r\n will say that doing a particular ritual or mantra is the \nonly way to solv=\r\ne a particular problem or to experience a particular \naspect of god. Just a=\r\ns one can reach a mountain top from various sides \nusing various paths, one=\r\n can reach god using various paths. God is not \nelsewhere, but within us. B=\r\nut, the conditioning accumulated thru many \nlives makes us look at things w=\r\nith attraction and aversion and mind \nvibrates with attraction, aversion, p=\r\nride, shame, anger, jealosy etc. If \nmind becomes nearly still, one can be =\r\nin bliss and the divine energy \nwithin expresses outside. The goal of vario=\r\nus relgions is to take the \nmind to that state.\n\nThere are many ways to fac=\r\nilitate that. Chanting a sacred combinations \nof syllables with a focused m=\r\nind is one way. In my opinion, one can \nachieve one-pointedness of mind wit=\r\nh any syllable combination. Mind \nachieving one-pointedness with any mantra=\r\n and/or mental imagery is a \ngood thing. But depending the mantra/imagery, =\r\na different kind of energy \nenvelopes that focused mind, purifies it and af=\r\nfects it. It just so \nhappens that many great realized yogis came on the bl=\r\nessed land of India \nand cataloged many mantras and imagery. In other relig=\r\nions also, many \npeople have experienced one-pointedness of mind on a \nthou=\r\nght/imagery/sound combination and experienced divinity. A muslim can \ntake =\r\na surah from Quran and meditate with it. In fact, some sufi saints \ndid exp=\r\nerience divinity like that. Also, there are paths other than \nmeditation. S=\r\nerving others and trying to see god in all is a valid path \ntoo. Oneday, mi=\r\nnd can experience god that way too.\n\nWhile other areas of the world had the=\r\nir share of realized souls, India \nhad just too many of them. What is known=\r\n today as Hinduism has a rich \nlibrary of knowledge from their experiences =\r\nand revelations. One can try \na path that was traversed by others and is we=\r\nll-understood. It does not \nmean those on the other side of the mountain ar=\r\ne doomed.\n\n*        *        *\n\n&gt; doing homams or not doing homams or any o=\r\nther hindu worship method\n\nJapam and homam are not the monopoly of any reli=\r\ngion and not just &quot;Hindu \nworship methods&quot;. People who meditated with speci=\r\nal chants and \nexperienced ecstasy, bliss and inner divinity came in every =\r\npart of the \nworld and in every religion.\n\nAs for homam, sacredness of fire=\r\n and the ability to connect to the \ndivine faster when using fire, was know=\r\nn to many religions. Not only \nHindus, but native Americans worshipped god =\r\nin fire, Zoroastrians did \nit, ancient Greco-Romans did it, some Buddhists =\r\ndid it, some south \nAmericans did it, some Scandinavians did it, and so on.=\r\n There are \nreferences in Bible of even Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Mos=\r\nes having \nworshipped god in fire. For example, GENESIS 8:20 says &quot;And Noah=\r\n builded \nan altar unto the Lord; and took of every clean beast, and of eve=\r\nry \nclean fowl, and offered burnt offerings on the altar&quot;. The Korban Olah =\r\n\n(&quot;whole offering&quot;) of Judaism, where a whole animal was burnt in fire, \nis=\r\n very similar to &quot;poornaahuti&quot; (whole offering) of homam where a full \ncoco=\r\nnut symbolizing head or ego is burnt in fire. The seven candles of \nminorah=\r\n, an integral part of judaism, remind us of the seven tongues of \nAgni.\n\nNe=\r\nw Testament refers to baptism with fire (baptism is purification by \nsprink=\r\nling or dipping in holy water). John the Baptist says, &quot;I indeed \nbaptize y=\r\nou with water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is \nmightier t=\r\nhan I =E2=80=93 He will baptize you with the Holy Spirit and fire.&quot; \n(MATTH=\r\nEW 3:11). Purification with fire is superior to purification with \nwater. N=\r\note that fire is clubbed with Holy Spirit here. In Veda also, \nfire is used=\r\n as a symbol of Self.\n\nMany seekers in many religions achieved the ascensio=\r\nn of individual \nconsciousness into cosmic consciousness using the medium o=\r\nf fire. With \nadvancing Kali yuga, knowledge has given way to ignorance in =\r\nmany \nreligions and now finally in Hinduism too! However, a Satya yuga like=\r\n \nsub-period within Kali yuga is coming again.\n\nBTW, the under construction=\r\n website http://FireYoga.net has some more \ninformation along these lines.\n=\r\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish W=\r\nritings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:=\r\n\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a =\r\ndifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- In JyotishGroup=\r\n@yahoogroups.com, Venkat Rao &lt;mail2venkyrao@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Pranaam Narasi=\r\nmhaji,\n&gt;\n&gt; In this world,population of Hindus are less compared to Muslims =\r\nand \n&gt; there are people following different religion.Most of the other \n&gt; r=\r\neligion do not incorporate worshipping planets - be it  with -sincere \n&gt; wo=\r\nrship or insincere worship or doing homams or not doing homams or \n&gt; any ot=\r\nher hindu worship method.If that is the case how do we see \n&gt; planets prote=\r\ncting them.Please do not answer this with answers like \n&gt; &quot;faith&quot; or &quot;fate&quot;=\r\n as they are nothing but excuses since your mail \n&gt; below claims to be very=\r\n scientific and  result oriented for performed \n&gt; actions.\n&gt;\n&gt; Eg-\n&gt;\n&gt;  If =\r\none chants a kavacha 10-30 times everyday and does it for 40-60 \n&gt; days, th=\r\nen some kind of results can be expected.

Kavachas =\r\nof various deities (or \n&gt; planets) are protective sheaths covering one&#39;s co=\r\nnsciousness and \n&gt; stopping harmful influences.\n&gt;\n&gt; Grahas (literal meaning=\r\n: those who grasp or get hold of) give good and \n&gt; bad results by grasping =\r\none&#39;s consciousness and affecting it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Each planet has positives and neg=\r\natives, in general and also based on \n&gt; the chart. If one chants the kavach=\r\na of a planet many times, \n&gt; eventually a protective sheath is formed aroun=\r\nd one&#39;s consciousness \n&gt; with the nature and energy of that planet. This wi=\r\nll obviously offer \n&gt; protection that is consistent with the nature of that=\r\n planet, in \n&gt; general and in one&#39;s chart. But, please remember that readin=\r\ng the \n&gt; kavacha of any planet will NOT harm you. Even the kavacha of 8th l=\r\nord \n&gt; or 6th lord will not harm one.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose one has Pi lagna. If he c=\r\nhants Sukra kavacha, Venus will \n&gt; protect one from loss of courage (3rd), =\r\nproblems to shoulders (3rd), \n&gt; untimely death (i.e. loss of longevity/8th)=\r\n, problems in anus/genital \n&gt; area (8th) etc. There may be other things bas=\r\ned on other factors like \n&gt; aspects, occupancy etc. Based on his inherent n=\r\nature, Venus may also \n&gt; protect in the matters of love, romance, creativit=\r\ny etc also. \n&gt; Bottomline is that the aspects of one&#39;s personality that the=\r\n planet is \n&gt; conducive to will be protected by the planet&#39;s energy.\n&gt;\n&gt; If=\r\n you pick a wrong planet, you may not get the desired result, but no \n&gt; har=\r\nm is done. Even bad planets in your chart will have some aspects \n&gt; they wa=\r\nnt to protect and doing their kavacha will protect those \n&gt; aspects.\n&gt;\n&gt; Be=\r\nst will be to chant the kavachas of lagna lord, dispositor of lagna \n&gt; lord=\r\n, Moon&#39;s dispositor and Sun&#39;s dispositor. Even better will be to \n&gt; chant t=\r\nhe kavachas of devatas instead of planets. Out of all the \n&gt; kavachas I hav=\r\ne seen until now, Narayana kavacha (from \n&gt; SrimadBhagavatam) and Chandi Ka=\r\nvacha are the most potent kavachas.\n&gt;\n&gt; But please note that chanting a kav=\r\nacha once or twice or even once or \n&gt; twice a day is hardly sufficient. If =\r\none has enough purity already, \n&gt; most mantras work right away. But most of=\r\n us have very dense \n&gt; conditioning and the energy of mantras gets disperse=\r\nd. The energy of \n&gt; the planet/deity of the kavacha we chant cannot form a =\r\nsheath around \n&gt; us easily. It requires intense sadhana for most people. If=\r\n one chants \n&gt; a kavacha 10-30 times everyday and does it for 40-60 days, t=\r\nhen some \n&gt; kind of results can be expected. Intense sadhana with any mantr=\r\na is \n&gt; needed for most people to see some results.
