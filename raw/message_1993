You seek permission to do homam\n2. Do pranayamam to calm yourself and foc=\r\nus\n3. You announce your intention of doing homam\n4. You start the fire and =\r\npurify it (by saying Om Bhu: swahA 8 times while dropping ghee)\n5. pick any=\r\n deity and any mantra - This is where you are invoking god. If you do not k=\r\nnow the sanskrit slokas for invoking god, just say Oh &lt;selected deity&gt; plea=\r\nse come and stay in the fire. Then you can recite the mantra with a om swah=\r\na in the end and drop a drop of ghee in the fire.\n6. Put some thing for nai=\r\nvedyam and conclude by om bhu swaha etc.\n7. Put some raisins/plain cooked r=\r\nice for the ganas of the deity you selected around the homakundam and put t=\r\nhe dry coconut into the fire\n(this is symbolisism for giving up your ego)\n8=\r\n. Do any kind of japam/dhyanam in front of the fire.\n9. Invite the deity ba=\r\nck into you and pray the god to complete any thing you did incomplete and g=\r\nive away the doership of the homam to the god him self (i.e. try to convinc=\r\ne yourself that God made you do the homam and you just carried on His will.=\r\n\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;=\r\nvinitakuma@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Pranam, Narasimhaji,\n&gt; \n&gt; i read postings select=\r\nively and therefore have missed several useful information on tarpana. the =\r\nmessage u have posted is indeed very informative. though one knows that sun=\r\n symbolises the soul and moon the mind i never thought in terms of &quot;subtle&quot;=\r\n karmas being burnt thru homam and &quot;gross&quot; karmas of pitris being burnt thr=\r\nu tarpana.\n&gt; \n&gt; There have been years of trying one thing after another in =\r\nthe hope of dissolving karmas. Sometimes i doubted my own sincerety...somet=\r\nimes i thought my karmas must indeed be very deep rooted. \n&gt; \n&gt; In my years=\r\n of trying to find answers thru astrology i blamed 3 retro planets for the =\r\ndeep rooted karmas. In terms of your posting from the archives i see things=\r\n in a slightly different light. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sun is conjoined with combust retro M=\r\nercury which in turn is closely conjoined with Ketu making it a malefic. Su=\r\nn is aspected by retro Mars and of course Rahu. The only saving grace is th=\r\nat Jupiter is also there with Sun. So maybe there are lots of subtle karmas=\r\n to be burnt.\n&gt; \n&gt; As for the Moon it is aspected by retro exalted Saturn f=\r\nrom the house of rin (6th) as well as retro Mars (8th H) and conjoined with=\r\n lagnesh Venus (self). So maybe there are lots of gross karmas to be dissol=\r\nved thru tarpana. And because Moon is with Lagnesh maybe tarpana is even mo=\r\nre necessary.\n&gt; \n&gt; i sincerely believe in the energies around us and a whol=\r\ne subtle world waiting to be accessed / experienced. Even though at present=\r\n there is no direct experience of such a world, maybe as things progress...=\r\nthere may be tranformations...to enable a better understanding of these thi=\r\nngs...\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry, for asking who is Rama at the end of Ramayana...but i wo=\r\nuld still like to know how deities are invoked in fire. I have been perform=\r\ning the bare minimum homam that u described in one of your messages. i foll=\r\now all the 7 steps described there. In step number 5 where u say &quot;pick any =\r\ndeity and any mantra&quot;, i recite &quot;om gam ganapataye namah&quot;. In step no.6 whi=\r\nle pouring ghee i recite &quot;om bhuh swahaa, om bhuvah swahaa, om suvah swaaha=\r\n, om bhurbhuvahsuvah swahaa, om shri vishnave swahaa, om namo rudraaye pash=\r\nupataye swaaha&quot;. Then i place a piece of dry coconut in the hom and sit for=\r\n meditation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is the deity invoked at this point?\n&gt; \n&gt; If i want to inc=\r\nlude pitri tarpana also in this, how do i go about it?\n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t know if i=\r\n am done! There is a long way to go....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; vinita\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Ram ji,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Shraaddham is an offering of balls =\r\nof solid food for deceased ancestors on special occasions.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Pitri =\r\ntarpana is an offering of water for pitris (deceased ancestors who are stuc=\r\nk with some desires) to satisfy them. Not so long ago, every Braahmana used=\r\n to perform a brief pitri tarpana everyday, as a part of daily rituals. Thi=\r\ns is not without reason.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The though=\r\nts of the minds around us do have a subtle impact on our mind. When too man=\r\ny depressed, sad or frustrated people are around you, it will have a negati=\r\nve effect on you. Similarly, when some peaceful and blissful people or elev=\r\nated souls are around you, it will have a positive effect on you. Thus, tho=\r\nughts in the minds around you does have an impact on you.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; This is=\r\n particularly true with respect to the minds of people who have genetic/kaa=\r\nrmik links/debts with you. When minds of such people are in great distress =\r\nor great excitement, it has an impact on your mind.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If a deceased=\r\n ancestor to whom you have a kaarmik debt has some strong desires and unabl=\r\ne to progress to a higher loka or be reborn, his thoughts and desires will =\r\nhave an impact on your mind.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Thus, we invest our mental energy pr=\r\naying for their relief. While offering balls of solid food (shraaddha) on s=\r\npecial occasions, pray that the ancestor may get an appropriate body again =\r\nto fulfil remaining desires. While leaving water in pitri tarpana, pray tha=\r\nt the ancestor&#39;s desires may be satisfied and the ancestor may be overcome =\r\nthe weaknesses. By praying for helping an ancestor, you are indirectly help=\r\ning yourself, by removing a powerful negative influence on your mind and ge=\r\ntting rid of some weaknesses.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Unfortunately, the extremely simple=\r\n ritual of pitri tarpana is out of fashion today. However, so many people w=\r\nill benefit tremendously if they do it atleast once every month if not dail=\r\ny. Vimalananda says that he will pick pitri tarpana if there is only one ri=\r\ntual he can perform.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Not long ago, =\r\nevery orthodox Braahmana used to perform a fire ritual and a water ritual (=\r\ntarpana) everyday. Rituals use external symbols to induce internal changes.=\r\n These two rituals are really important and useful rituals.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; A sma=\r\nll comparison of homam and tarpana is reproduced from vedic-wisdom yahoogro=\r\nup archives:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; --------------------------\n&gt; &gt; One word on Homam vs =\r\nTarpana. In homam, you are calling devatas and the medium is fire. In tarpa=\r\nna, you are calling pitris and the medium is water. Both sadhanas are appli=\r\ncable to all people irrespective of whether watery signs/planets are strong=\r\n or fiery signs/planets in their horoscope.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In homam, devatas com=\r\ne in fire and burn your blocking karmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris c=\r\nome in water and free you from vasanas (conditioning of the mind) that were=\r\n karmically inherited from them. If you have genes from (and rina with) an =\r\nancestor who was lustful or angry or jealous and the consciousness of the d=\r\neceased ancestor is still having those thoughts, you will also suffer from =\r\nsuch thoughts due to the connection and may even commit some bad karmas bec=\r\nause of the weaknesses. You can free yourself from the rina by working on g=\r\niving a rebirth to that ancestor. If the ancestor&#39;s consciousness is attach=\r\ned to a new body, the thoughts and cravings of that consciousness will not =\r\naffect your consciousness in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a =\r\nstrong source of bad karmas, while homam burns off previously committed bad=\r\n karmas. Both are very important sadhanas for spiritual progress.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Devatas are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their self-identification =\r\nis to what is known as soul and represented by Sun. They work on your indiv=\r\nidual soul and free it from the karmas it carries. Pitris are grosser forms=\r\n of consciousness with strong attachments and desires. Their self-identific=\r\nation is with what is known as mind and represented by Moon. You may note t=\r\nhat Sun and Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris in the hora chart of =\r\nastrology. Fire and water are the natural media for them respectively.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Devas and pitris have different ways of working and influencing us an=\r\nd helping our spiritual progress. But both are relevant to all of us and ha=\r\nve a role to play in our spiritual evolution. Worshipping devas in fire and=\r\n satisfying pitris in water are very important.\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------=\r\n---\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nvedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast=\r\n.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; -----=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, Ramakrishnan Krishnamurthy &lt;ramki108@&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for this valuable ma=\r\nnual. Could you enlighten me on the difference between Pitri Tarpana and Sh=\r\nraddham? I believe Shraddham is performed once a year on the thithi of demi=\r\nse of one&#39;s father (to be performed by the eldest son). There are some vari=\r\nants such as performing it during the Shraddha Paksham instead of on the ac=\r\ntual thithi, every year. Also, have heard of a Gaya Shraddham, which is to =\r\nbe performed once in a lifetime, and which makes it unnecessary to perform =\r\nyearly Shraddham subsequently. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have tried to search for mate=\r\nrial on this but have not succeeded so far. At least if you can provide inf=\r\normation on some sources, it would be a great help.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks an=\r\nd regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ram\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Fri, 12/6/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

It contains a very short procedure for Vishnu =\r\nsahasra naama homam. It is very detailed and pretty much anybody can follow=\r\n it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Those who regularly chant Vishnu sahasra naama stotram sh=\r\nould be able to perform a homam if they spend an extra 10 minutes, after a =\r\nlittle practice. For those who are pressed for time and yet want to do a ho=\r\nmam, a super-short procedure involving one verse is also given.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; The manual is available in English language, with mantras given in Sanskr=\r\nit/Hindi, English, Telugu, Kannada or Malayalam scripts.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In ad=\r\ndition to this manual, manuals for Mahaganapathi homam, Chandi homam, Krish=\r\nna homam, Shiva homam, Mahalakshmi homam, Sani homam and Kuja homam are ava=\r\nilable. More will be coming later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chanting Vishnu&#39;s 1000 name=\r\ns is very powerful in this age. It is the best antidote for many problems, =\r\nmaterial and spiritual.
