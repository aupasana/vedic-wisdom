It is either this or that.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Both are correct, but at different levels. I will elaborate. However,\n=\r\n&gt; this is philosophically complex and those who do not follow what I say\n&gt; =\r\nshould not worry at all.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Non-dual self has no divisio=\r\nn of self into various objects or space or\n&gt; time. There is no concept of t=\r\nime or space or space-time continuum\n&gt; within non-dual self. A yogi absorbe=\r\nd in non-dual self has no sense of\n&gt; space or time or objectification.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Supreme cosmic being is the link between duality and non-duality.\n&gt; Sup=\r\nreme cosmic being arising in this non-dual self captures the entire\n&gt; field=\r\n of duality within Him. All beings, entire space and all space-time\n&gt; conti=\r\nnua within the field of duality exist within Him. From the\n&gt; perspective of=\r\n supreme cosmic being, all beings of the dual world are\n&gt; His parts and all=\r\n their individual wills are parts of His cosmic will.\n&gt; As all space-time c=\r\nontinua are within Him, there is nothing that is\n&gt; unknown to Him. Past, pr=\r\nesent and future; here, there and everywhere; I,\n&gt; you and others, this pos=\r\nsibility, that possibility and yet another\n&gt; possibility - all are accessib=\r\nle and fully &quot;known&quot; to His\n&gt; self-awareness.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now, let us come lowe=\r\nr and into the field of duality. The field of\n&gt; duality consists of infinit=\r\ne divisions of space, time and space-time\n&gt; continua. There are infinite po=\r\nssibilities within this field.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Normally, people stuck deeply within=\r\n duality have a linear sense of\n&gt; time and perceive just a part of one spac=\r\ne-time continuum. However,\n&gt; field of duality also contains planes of consc=\r\niousness where different\n&gt; senses of time and different space-time continua=\r\n (that may intersect at\n&gt; various points) exist. A yogi who experiences suc=\r\nh a space-time\n&gt; continuum in such a plane of consciousness may experience =\r\na point of\n&gt; time that maps to a future time in a regular space-time contin=\r\nuum being\n&gt; experienced by you. Also, what is 1 minute in one space-time co=\r\nntinuum\n&gt; may be 1 year in another space-time continuum. Time is not as\n&gt; s=\r\ntraight-forward an entity as one may think. Basically, the field of\n&gt; duali=\r\nty contains infinite space-time continua and what one experiences\n&gt; depends=\r\n on the plane of consciousness that one&#39;s self-awareness\n&gt; (Kundalini) is i=\r\nn. But, most of us experience part of a specific\n&gt; space-time continuum and=\r\n hence think that that is the only reality. But\n&gt; relaity consists of infin=\r\nite space-time continua that intersect each\n&gt; other. These are all differen=\r\nt possibilities and you chart out your\n&gt; course based on your actions and N=\r\nature&#39;s reactions to your actions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From the perspecti=\r\nve of a yogi who is in a different space-time\n&gt; continuum, your state may b=\r\ne known at a time that is in &quot;future&quot; as per\n&gt; the space-time continuum in =\r\nwhich you exist. But, from the perspective\n&gt; of the space-time continuum th=\r\nat you are in, your state at that future\n&gt; time is not yet known and depend=\r\ns on your current action.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If a yogi in a different space-time conti=\r\nnuum has seen your state in\n&gt; future, his observation is merely an observat=\r\nion and from his reference\n&gt; frame. It has no causal relationship to your c=\r\nurrent action or your\n&gt; future state. He is merely an observer and he does =\r\nnot cause anything to\n&gt; happen. His observation is specific to some space-t=\r\nime pairs and does\n&gt; not cover all the space-time pairs that you will trave=\r\nrse as you travel\n&gt; to reach the space-time pair where he observed you (if =\r\nat all you do!).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let us go further. Is there only one=\r\n future possible for you? Or, does\n&gt; the path traversed by you in space-tim=\r\ne continuum not fixed but variable\n&gt; based on your actions? Can your action=\r\ns at important cross-roads alter\n&gt; the course you traverse?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If so, =\r\nwhat is the meaning of a yogi observing you at a space-time\n&gt; pair? Is his =\r\nobservation only a possibility or a certainty? One may say\n&gt; &quot;how can one o=\r\nbserve a possibility? Anything we observe must be a\n&gt; certainty.&quot; But is th=\r\nat correct? Aren&#39;t the field of duality and the\n&gt; infinite space-time conti=\r\nnua contained in it merely a set of infinite\n&gt; possibilities?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Some =\r\ngreat rishis can see not just a space-time pair, but many\n&gt; space-time cont=\r\ninua at the same time, i.e. they can see various\n&gt; possibilities based on v=\r\narious possible actions. However, visions seen\n&gt; by most yogis about &quot;futur=\r\ne&quot; are just one possibility.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bottomline: At the level=\r\n at which we exist, there is certainly\n&gt; something called &quot;freewill&quot;. Withi=\r\nn the limits imposed by the reactions\n&gt; given by nature to your own previou=\r\ns actions, you do have a scope for\n&gt; engaging in different actions at this =\r\ntime. Depending on which action\n&gt; you engage in, the future can be slightly=\r\n different. Some actions can\n&gt; even make the future significantly different=\r\n. A rishi may be able to\n&gt; chart out a significant portion of the field of =\r\npossibilities for future\n&gt; (e.g. like a brilliant chess player figuring out=\r\n most possibilities upto\n&gt; 20 moves from now). An advanced yogi may be able=\r\n to see a few\n&gt; possibilities for future (e.g. like a good chess player fig=\r\nuring out a\n&gt; few moves or guessing a future position). But the supreme cos=\r\nmic being\n&gt; knows the entire field of possibilities, as they all exist with=\r\nin Him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, your actions are what bring to fruition (w.r.t. th=\r\ne reference\n&gt; frame of your consciousness!) some of those possibilities. On=\r\ne may know\n&gt; all the possibilities quite deeply and even guess the possibil=\r\nity that\n&gt; will come to fruition, but it is your actions that actually make=\r\n some of\n&gt; those possibilities a reality.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (=\r\nMP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows=\r\n): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: h=\r\nttp://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: rajar=\r\nshi nandy\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 30, =\r\n2009 5:22 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Freewill.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Nara=\r\nsimhaji\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; No doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail for all of us, howe=\r\nver, I\n&gt; could not help it that an inevitable question popped up in my mind=\r\n. One\n&gt; of the oft discussed and eternal questions.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If events have =\r\nalready been created like in a movie and later as time\n&gt; unfolds, they happ=\r\nen in our plane of existence, then all talk of\n&gt; freewill must be humbug?

He=\r\n did not know much about some of the ten\n&gt; incarnations. He described what =\r\nhe saw and I told him who was who and a\n&gt; little about them. One of the for=\r\nms he saw was a radiant man with white\n&gt; clothes riding a white horse on a =\r\ndusty road. I told him he was Kalki\n&gt; and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I w=\r\nas\n&gt; with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was=\r\n\n&gt; abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I ask=\r\ned what he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not that the future that\n&gt; is to c=\r\nome has not already happened. It has already happened in reality,\n&gt; but it =\r\nwill happen later when the time comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I\n&gt; guessed w=\r\nhat he was getting at, but pretended not to know. I said, &quot;no.\n&gt; What do yo=\r\nu mean?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; Thi=\r\ns boy is not\n&gt; known to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main chara=\r\ncteristic is\n&gt; that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented=\r\n and\n&gt; relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But he could not expr=\r\ness\n&gt; himself.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has al=\r\nready happened at\n&gt; some level, but will reveal itself to people later? Kin=\r\nd of like a\n&gt; movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a studi=\r\no. Some\n&gt; people may have already seen it. But people seeing it on the scre=\r\nen\n&gt; later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you saying\n&gt; so=\r\nmething like that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am sayin=\r\ng. If something is\n&gt; going to happen in future, it will happen when future =\r\ncomes. But\n&gt; somebody may be able to see it before future comes, because it=\r\n has\n&gt; already happened.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Though he did not mention it, I knew why =\r\nhe was thinking along these\n&gt; lines. When I told him the man riding the hor=\r\nse in his vision over the\n&gt; fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was p=\r\nrobably confused. Given\n&gt; his age and ability to think and understand thing=\r\ns, this probably seemed\n&gt; like an oddity to him that he should see somebody=\r\n who had not yet come.\n&gt; So he was trying to think how it was possible and =\r\ncame to some important\n&gt; conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nime seems linear at the level of regular consciousness. However, in\n&gt; many =\r\nplanes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It\n&gt; even lo=\r\nses its meaning when one is established in non-dual Aatman or\n&gt; Brahman or =\r\nSelf.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The same boy once performed a very short Kaali =\r\nhomam with a small\n&gt; naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added=\r\n before name. When\n&gt; we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very in=\r\ntense and powerful\n&gt; energy. It was quite different from the energy I feel =\r\nnormally. This\n&gt; intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blissful an=\r\nd a feeling\n&gt; that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am done here. I =\r\nhave\n&gt; nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire consciousns=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice before t=\r\nhat.\n&gt; Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting nex=\r\nt to\n&gt; my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second time wa=\r\ns\n&gt; when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya=\r\n\n&gt; of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Kaali idol\n&gt; th=\r\nere, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the past.\n&gt; Th=\r\ne energy I felt was the same on all the three occasions. At no other\n&gt; time=\r\n did I feel that intense shakti.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Interestingly, after we finished m=\r\neditation and opened eyes, that boy\n&gt; remarked, &quot;out of all the different h=\r\nomas I did so far, this is the\n&gt; bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, =\r\n&quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it,\n&gt; but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This boy performed a really simple and short procedure, =\r\nshorter than\n&gt; what I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful=\r\n in making a\n&gt; powerful energy manifest there. The bottomline is that inter=\r\nnal purity\n&gt; is the most important thing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Rituals help purify one a=\r\nnd purity helps one do a ritual better and\n&gt; get more out of it. It is an e=\r\ngg and chicken problem and one has to keep\n&gt; doing it until one breaks thro=\r\nugh.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Keep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do pay at=\r\ntention\n&gt; to internal purity as you engage in external practices. The only\n=\r\n&gt; worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how smaller your\n&gt;=\r\n ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist attraction to\n&gt; extern=\r\nal things better and you can resist internal enemies like lust,\n&gt; anger, je=\r\nalosy etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego - thinking\n&gt; that this=\r\n is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of all problems.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * *=\r\n *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but =\r\nbhakti\n&gt; yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you - including your=\r\n\n&gt; house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body - is god&#39;s\n&gt; prop=\r\nerty and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of these\n&gt; properties of=\r\n god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining the\n&gt; notion &quot;this =\r\nis mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care of his\n&gt; master&#39;s propert=\r\nies, but without thinking of all those things as his or\n&gt; her belongings.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for takin=\r\ng\n&gt; good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes the best care=\r\n\n&gt; of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a servant does\n&gt;=\r\n not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept that is\n&gt; master=\r\n&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. This enables one to do\n&gt; the bes=\r\nt job with what one possesses and not worry about what one does\n&gt; not posse=\r\nss or what is out of one&#39;s control.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Developing the attitude of a se=\r\nrvant who takes care of master&#39;s\n&gt; properties will help one wade the ocean =\r\nof worldly life without getting\n&gt; caught and overcome ego.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.or=\r\ng/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ t=\r\narpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free J=\r\nyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannat=\r\nh Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
