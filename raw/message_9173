When a\nhighly purifi=\r\ned mind makes offerings internally, it is possible for it to be\nhighly focu=\r\nsed on the visualization. That can indeed be more effective.\n \nHowever, unt=\r\nil one reaches such a stage, it is quite useful (and often\nunavoidable) to =\r\nengage in external and material offerings. A mind that is\nunfocused and dis=\r\ntracted needs some objects and actions to anchor it and\nmake it somewhat fo=\r\ncused and disciplined.\n\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spir=\r\nituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&lt;http://www.vedicastrolo=\r\nger.org/&gt; \n--------\n \n\n________________________________\n\n\tFrom: monkeymonke=\r\nyking10 &lt;monkeymonkeyking10@...&gt;\n\tTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n\t=\r\nSent: Thursday, April 11, 2013 10:07 AM\n\tSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Manas Puja=\r\n\n\t\n\n\t  \n\tNamaste to All,\n\t\n\tI have recently heard it said that offerings ma=\r\nde &#39;mentally&#39; can be\nsuperior/more effective in manifesting desired results=\r\n than actual material\nofferings.
