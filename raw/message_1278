You can collect the homam ashes. The recommended method of disposal is to \nscatter them in a flowing stream of water such as a river or an ocean.\n\n2. No need to dip in ghee. You can offer sesame seeds separately sometimes \nand ghee separately sometimes etc.\n\n3. I replied separately.\n\n4. Perhaps in future..\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;suvarnatejas&quot; &lt;suvarnatejas@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, February 23, 2009 4:31 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Questions on the Homam Procedure\n\n\n&gt; Dear Sri PVR:\n&gt;\n&gt; thank you for doing this service to all of mankind.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a few questions and some suggestions on the procedure.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1. I am curious as to how you dispose of the homam ashes everyday?\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. On the usage of puffed rice, dhanyams etc, Are these to be used\n&gt;   dipped in ghee?\n&gt;   I have read somewhere for e.g. that sesame seeds are dipped in ghee\n&gt;   for the offering.\n&gt;\n&gt; 3. Like another gentleman asked, What is the brihat or extended\n&gt;   procedure? I see that the Jayadi homam step and\n&gt;   punyahavachanam, Varuna pooja at the beginning etc are missing.\n&gt;   For completeness, would you elaborate on the missing steps?\n&gt;\n&gt; 4. A suggestion.\n&gt;   Please post references to the source of each step/mantra.\n&gt;   I feel that this would greatly solidify the document and make it\n&gt;   formal. I completely understand that this is meant as a spiritual\n&gt;   guide, and yet one doesn&#39;t preclude the other.\n&gt;\n&gt;   For example: What is the source of using the chamakam verses in\n&gt;   the Vasordhara step?\n&gt;   My suggestion is to post it exactly as one would in a scientific\n&gt;   paper, with a reference number, and the last page listing\n&gt;   the reference sources.\n&gt;   Similarly on the verses used in Uttarangam etc.\n\n\n"}}
