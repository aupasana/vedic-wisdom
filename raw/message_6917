You =\r\ndont need to stop your homam. You can find any other alternative. For me i =\r\nuse only dry coconut and only ghee for aahutis. i avoid even putting too mu=\r\nch of camphor etc.  for food i use one or two raisins.  i dont use havan sa=\r\nmagri or puffed rice.  for poornahuti  i use 1/4 of dry coconut. \n\nYou can =\r\nexperiment with different and cheaper options like placing  your havan kund=\r\n near window/door. or using an exhaust above homam kund. try keeping it awa=\r\ny from walls or do homam in balcony or roof if possible. other cost heavy o=\r\nptions can be getting a custom made chimney like utpal ji. using chemical s=\r\npone as advised can be a good idea. \n\nhomam is not the problem problem is s=\r\nmoke. so let us stop the smoke not homam :-)\n\nif you find yourself still in=\r\n mid of problem please give some more details u think can be needed. we all=\r\n will be happy to help\n\nregards\n\n\n"}}
