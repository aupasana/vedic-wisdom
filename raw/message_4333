To be still is not to t=\r\nhink. Know, and\nnot think, is the word! (Talks, 131).\n\nSolitude is in the m=\r\nind of man. One might be in the thick of the world and\nmaintain serenity of=\r\n mind; such a one is in solitude. Another may stay in\nthe forest but still =\r\nbe unable to control his mind. He cannot be said to be\nin solitude. Solitud=\r\ne is a function of the mind. A man attached to desire\ncannot get solitude w=\r\nherever he many be; a detached man is always in\nsolitude. (Talks, 20).\n\nYou=\r\n can never find the mind through mind. Pass beyond it in order to find it\nn=\r\non-existent. (Talks, 473).\n\nAll thoughts are inconsistent with realisation.=\r\n The correct state is to\nexclude thoughts of ourselves and all other though=\r\nts.Thought is one thing\nand realisation is quite another. (Talks, 30).\n\nIt =\r\nmust be clearly understood that meditation is not prohibited in the\nabsence=\r\n of asanas or prescribed times or any accessories of the kind.\n(Talks, 17).=\r\n\n\nThere is no jnana as it is commonly understood. The ordinary ideas of jna=\r\nna\nand ajnana are only relative and false.They are not real and therefore n=\r\not\nabiding. The true state is the non-dual Self. It is eternal and abides\nw=\r\nhether one is aware\nor not. (Talks, 499).\n\nJnana, once revealed, takes time=\r\n to steady itself. The Self is certainly\nwithin the direct experience of ev=\r\neryone, but not as one imagines it to be.\nIt is only as It is. (Talks, 141)=\r\n.\n\nExperience is said to be temporary or permanent. The first experience is=\r\n\ntemporary and by concentration it can become permanent. In the former the\n=\r\nbondage is not completely destroyed; it remains subtle and reasserts itself=\r\n\nin due course.But in the latter it is destroyed root and branch, never to\n=\r\nappear again. (Talks, 95).\n\nThere is no investigation into the Atman. The i=\r\nnvestigation can only be into\nthe non-Self. Elimination of the non-Self is =\r\nalone possible. The Self being\nalways self-evident will shine forth of itse=\r\nlf. (Talks, 78).\n\nJnana-marga and bhakti-marga are one and the same. Selfsu=\r\nrrender leads to\nrealisation just as enquiry does. Complete self-surrender =\r\nmeans that you\nhave no further thought of =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.Then all your=\r\n vasanas are washed off and you\nare free. You should not continue as a sepa=\r\nrate entity at the end of either\ncourse. (Talks, 31).\n\nSurrender unreserved=\r\nly. One of the two things must be done: either surrender\nbecause you admit =\r\nyour inability and also require a Higher Power to help\nyou; or investigate =\r\ninto the cause of misery, go to the source and merge\ninto the Self. Either =\r\nway you will be free from misery. God never forsakes\none who has surrendere=\r\nd. (Talks, 363).\n\nSurrender is to give oneself up to the original source of=\r\n one=E2=80=99s being. Do\nnot delude yourself by imagining such source to be=\r\n some God outside you.\nOne=E2=80=99s source is within oneself.Give yourself=\r\n up to it. That means that you\nshould seek the source and merge in it. (Tal=\r\nks, 111).\n\nIf on the other hand you merge in the Self there will be no indi=\r\nviduality\nleft. You will become the Source itself. In that case...what is s=\r\nurrender?\nWho is to surrender and to whom? This constitutes devotion, wisdo=\r\nm and\ninvestigation. (Talks, 208).\n\nThe =E2=80=98Gita=E2=80=99 starts sayin=\r\ng that you are not the body, that you are not\ntherefore the doer. So one sh=\r\nould act without thinking that oneself is the\nactor. The actions go on desp=\r\nite this egolessness.The person has come into\nmanifestation for a certain p=\r\nurpose.That purpose will be accomplished\nwhether he considers himself the a=\r\nctor or not. (Talks, 643).\n\nHow do we know that actions are ours or not?...=\r\n If the fruits of actions do\nnot affect the person, he is free from action.=\r\n (Talks, 40).\n\nThe one infinite Unbroken Whole (plenum) becomes aware of It=\r\nself as =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99.\nThis is the original name. All other names,e.g=\r\n., OM, are later growths.\nLiberation is only to remain aware of the Self.

Then only knowledge dawns. Thus the need for the\ninstructio=\r\nn of the Upanishads and of wise sages. (Talks, 92).\n\nThe ultimate Truth is =\r\nso simple. It is nothing more than being in the\npristine state. This is all=\r\n that need be said. (Talks, 96).\n\nReality is one only. How can it be realis=\r\ned? Realisation is thus an\nillusion. Practice seems to be necessary. Who is=\r\n to practise? Looking for\nthe doer, the act and the accessories disappear. =\r\nMoreover, if Realisation is\nnot present here and now,how can it, newly got,=\r\n be of any use? Realise what\nis present here and now. The sages did so befo=\r\nre and still do that\nonly.Hence they say that it looks as if newly got.
