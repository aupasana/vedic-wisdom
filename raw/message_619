Giving samadhi to a highly logical person (logical mind is a great obs=\r\ntacle)=C2=A0like Naren just by a mere touch is no ordinary feat.=C2=A0He no=\r\nt only experienced sahaja samadhi himself, which is off limits for even gre=\r\nat siddhas, but induced it in Naren for a few days by the power of his thou=\r\nght. All these are signs of a being of the highest class.\n=C2=A0\nKnowing wh=\r\nat kind a being Ramakrishna is, I am not too surprised or excited by what y=\r\nou said. I am really and genuinely sorry that you expected a different reac=\r\ntion from me. But I don&#39;t feign a reaction that I do not really feel. I am =\r\nreally sorry.\n=C2=A0\nWhat you described IS a miracle. I do not doubt it at =\r\nall. I am sorry if I gave that impression.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nHon=\r\nestly, when I read several of the miraculous deeds of Ramakrishna, I do not=\r\n feel much excitement or emotion. I don&#39;t know why. On the other hand, simp=\r\nle episodes like how he cried and begged Vivekananda not to leave make me w=\r\neep. He transformed Naren from an overly logical young boy to a mature man =\r\nwith the highest vairagya and he gave Naren many tremendous spiritual exper=\r\niences. Later Vivekananda said that the &quot;mad brahmin&quot; transformed him and m=\r\nade him who he was. He said Ramakrishna could have=C2=A0created 100 Vivekan=\r\nandas from dirt!=C2=A0Yet, Ramakrishna did not feel any entitlement or owne=\r\nrship and, instead, he cried and begged his disciple to=C2=A0not leave=C2=\r\n=A0and do the Mother&#39;s work. What a pure and sattwik soul! When I think of =\r\nhis attitude, I get goosebumps.\n=C2=A0\nWhen I read how he simply left the p=\r\nremises when told by a representative of Mathur that he was dismissed and h=\r\nad to leave the temple and how he came back as if nothing happned when Math=\r\nur came and fell at his feet and how he behaved the same way as if nothing =\r\nhappened in both cases is a practical demonstration of what Krishna taught =\r\nin Gita. When I read about that, I melt in emotion.\n=C2=A0\nThus, simple epi=\r\nsodes bringing out the attitude of Thakur and illustrate how a sthita prajn=\r\na described by Krishna in Gita behaves excite me.\n=C2=A0\nThe things about R=\r\namakrishna that excite me, make me weep and make me emotional=C2=A0may be a=\r\n little different from some other people.\n=C2=A0\nBottomline is that Thakur =\r\nexictes both of us. Perhaps there are different aspects of Thakur that we a=\r\nre attached to and attracted to. But the good thing is that we are both att=\r\nracted to him.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nSuppose what he said to Sarad=\r\na Mata was only a &quot;desire&quot; and it did not happen. Suppose he is reborn afte=\r\nr 150 years and has not yet come back.

I remembered his words that=\r\n morning and told my wife that if my decision is right, Mr. Patel should co=\r\nme to my house. I was not knowing then actually Mr. Patel will come to my p=\r\nlace within 10 minutes and Thakur will show him the way to my home. \nYou ha=\r\nve written that Thakur might have taken rebirth after 100 years.

Thank you for sh=\r\naring it.\n=C2=A0\nAfter Ramakrishna left his body, several people saw him in=\r\n embodied form.\n=C2=A0\nThat is entirely possible. When someone who did not =\r\nidentify with a body but identified with the entire universe lives in a bod=\r\ny and leaves, it is not like he has left. He is still there, in every atom =\r\nand in everything. If someone is attached to him with that body of his and =\r\nhe has compassion for that person, he *can* give darshan to that person in =\r\nthat body. It is not that he is &quot;alive&quot; or &quot;dead&quot;. It is just that he is in=\r\n every atom or sub-atomic particle of this creation because he has realized=\r\n the true nature of Self while living in the previous body and that realiza=\r\ntion was intact even while leaving that body.\n=C2=A0\nAccording to Sarada Ma=\r\nta, Ramakrishna told her and Lakshmi that he would be back after 100 years =\r\nand that all of them would have to be reborn when he is reborn after 100 ye=\r\nars. Thus, he may have already come to earth in a different body. But that =\r\ndoes not matter. Those who have an attachment to Ramakrishna and stuck at t=\r\nhe lower level form may still be able to access his previous form.\n=C2=A0\nE=\r\nven after the form of Rama left this=C2=A0world and the form of=C2=A0Krishn=\r\na was born, a devotee of Rama who does great tapascharya for Rama may be ab=\r\nle to realize a darshan of the form of Rama.\n=C2=A0\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa=\r\n was almost certainly an avatara.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short H=\r\nomam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas You=\r\nrself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups=\r\n. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicas=\r\ntro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.o=\r\nrg\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n \n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Ashwin Rawal \nTo: Vedic-wisdom@ yah=\r\noogroups. com \nCc: pvr@charter. net \nSent: Wednesday, November 05, 2008 10:=\r\n25 AM\nSubject: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n\nDear Sir, I=\r\n would like to share one of my great Devine experience about shri Ramkrishn=\r\nadev. This is an unbelievable experience that I have had. I have not added =\r\nanything from my own. I am writing exactly as was happened in my life. I am=\r\n going back to the period of 1973/74. Kindly read this only when you are in=\r\n religious mood. \n\n\n\nI was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office=\r\n near Dwarka. My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allo=\r\nwance for extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post =\r\noffice and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some Telephone =\r\noperators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel) was wor=\r\nking as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri Ramkri=\r\nshnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking about shri Thakur=\r\n. We came close day by day. There was a weekly gathering at his home called=\r\n SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created by him and was weeping w=\r\nhile singing. He was reading Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters =\r\nwere attending this weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years=\r\n old. Mr. Patel was of 30 then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 p=\r\nm after duty hours and were talking only about Thakur. \n\nOne day when we we=\r\nre at sea shore he suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some guest have co=\r\nme to my home and my wife is remembering me. My son will come in a few minu=\r\ntes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with my surprise hi=\r\ns 8 years old son came to call him. \n\nAt one another incident he told me th=\r\nat there will be a plane crash tomorrow and that also happened. I was very =\r\nmuch impressed about him. He could foresee the events. One day I had to go =\r\nto Dwarka by Bus, he told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be pun=\r\nctured. Yet I went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was p=\r\nunctured on the way. This was surprising. \n\nThis all incidents made me to b=\r\nelieve that he had some super power and this was due to Ramkrishandev worsh=\r\nip only. I was attracted to shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also b=\r\ne disciple of shri Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surr=\r\nendered myself to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture=\r\n. I prayed him deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow=\r\n his grace. \n\nNext day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morn=\r\ning while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was waking up=\r\n at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have accepted Shr=\r\ni Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and she argued with me a=\r\n lot. =E2=80=94=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision? Ramkrish=\r\nna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a great Saint b=\r\nut our Guru should be living one, who can guide us, give us Mantra etc. etc=\r\n. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya since you are doing Gay=\r\natri Mantra=E2=80=9D--. \n\nHer arguments were right at her place as people i=\r\nn general not know much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I =\r\nhave taken hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. -- \n\nBut I =\r\nremember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling their disciples=\r\n to test him before accepting him. I also decided to test Thakur. I immedia=\r\ntely told my wife that =E2=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has never come to o=\r\nur home. You have also not seen him. He has never asked me where I am livin=\r\ng. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house within 10 to 15 minutes, would =\r\nyou believe that my selection for Thakur is perfect?=E2=80=9D-- \n\nShe laugh=\r\ned at me=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=\r\n=80=9D-- \n\nI prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my=\r\n decision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence even=\r\n today.=E2=80=99 \n\nTo our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30=\r\n in the morning with angry mood. What he told? \n\n=E2=80=98 How dare you tes=\r\nt Thakur this way? Do you know what happened? Yesterday was my night duty a=\r\nnd I had just come to my home at 05.30 mornings today and tried to sleep fo=\r\nr 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur pulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=\r\n=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s house. He is waiting for you. He wants to t=\r\nest me. I will show you his house=E2=80=9D \n\nI immediately rushed to your h=\r\nome. Thakur was guiding me the way to your house and pushing me too. What y=\r\nou want? Why you are disturbing him in such an early morning for such a sil=\r\nly things?=E2=80=99 \n\nWe both were so excited and surprised that we had no =\r\nwords that Morning. \n\nI will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in =\r\nmy life. There were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I wi=\r\nll write it sometime. \n\nDear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still=\r\n alive on the earth. This is a fact I have written and no word is added to =\r\nexaggerate.=C2=A0 May Shri Thakur bless all of us. \n\nDr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmed=\r\nabad  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Add more friends to your messenger and enjoy!

He transformed Naren from an overly logical =\r\nyoung boy to a mature man with the highest vairagya and he gave Naren many =\r\ntremendous spiritual experiences. Later Vivekananda said that the &quot;mad brah=\r\nmin&quot; transformed him and made him who he was. He said Ramakrishna could hav=\r\ne&nbsp;created 100 Vivekanandas from dirt!&nbsp;Yet, Ramakrishna did not fe=\r\nel any entitlement or ownership and, instead, he cried and begged his disci=\r\nple to&nbsp;not leave&nbsp;and do the Mother&#39;s work.

I am now stro=\r\nngly believe that Thakur is still alive on earth because my another inciden=\r\nts are also leading me to believe that He is coming to this earth.
