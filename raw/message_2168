Especially the =\r\nsolar eclipse of July 22 occurs when Sun is in the 6th degree of Cancer, wh=\r\nich is Sun&#39;s Mrityu Bhaga (death inflicting degree) in Cancer. When the ecl=\r\nipse starts in New Delhi, Sun, Moon, Ketu and ascendant are in the same ras=\r\ni and navamsa. Hence, this can be a problematic eclipse.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Eclipse ti=\r\nme is a very favorable time for spiritual sadhana, though temple rituals ar=\r\ne halted during eclipses. There is a reason for it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sun and Moon ar=\r\ne the eyes of Parama Purusha (the supreme cosmic being). Microcosmically, i=\r\nndividual soul (Sun) and individual mind (Moon) are the eyes through which =\r\nwe see the dual world around us. If individual soul and individual mind sto=\r\np seeing, one no longer experiences any objects in the field of duality. Th=\r\ne objectification within Brahman ceases and one is established in Brahman, =\r\ni.e. non-dual nirvikalpa samadhi. In other words, one realizes Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; To fulfil one&#39;s dharma as an individual in the field of duality, one need=\r\ns to be awake to the duality. One needs the individualized consciousness re=\r\npresented by Sun and Moon. Hence eclipse time when Sun or Moon is blocked i=\r\ns unfavorable for dharmik activities. Temples and temple rituals, which are=\r\n performed for collective dharma of society, are understandably halted. How=\r\never, it is a great time for spiritual sadhana for self-realization. This a=\r\npplies to homam as well. If one performs homam for material benefits, one s=\r\nhould stop during an eclipse. However, if one performs homam for spiritual =\r\nprogress and self-realization, a homam performed during an eclipse is much =\r\nmore powerful than at other times. One can perform homam to any deity durin=\r\ng an eclipse, though homam to an ugra devata may work better.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
