The previous l=\r\nocation I was at had a family that owned a cow and I could feed the bali (b=\r\nanana pieces) daily. I am offering raisins as bali and even pigeons are not=\r\n touching it. There are no sparrows (thanks to multiple base stations on ap=\r\nartments), else they would eat raisins. What are the other best alternative=\r\ns for bali offering ? Can I offer sugar crystals and drop them near some pl=\r\nants on the ground for ants to eat ? For time being I am saving the raisins=\r\n and on a weekend I will find a cow on the road to feed them all along with=\r\n non-bali bananas :-)\n\nAlso, I keep kalash as part of the ritual and use it=\r\n just to sprinkle water initially on all the homa samagri (havan items), bu=\r\nt later the water goes to plants. Can I do away with kalash completely and =\r\nuse my achamana cup water for the homa samagri suddhi ? The reason I ask is=\r\n, pouring the water to plants, etc saves atleast 5 minutes and on working d=\r\nays, even that is good save.\n\nLastly, can I cover the homa kundam (havan ku=\r\nnd) with a lid after I finish ? I do homam in balcony that is open and I do=\r\nnot want any dust, pigeon feathers, etc to fall into it. \n\nThank you.\n\nrega=\r\nrds\nrAma\n\n\n"}}
