Given the kind of kaarmik blockages most people have, persisten=\r\nt sadhana over a period of time is needed and one event cannot fix things.\n=\r\n\n \n\nAs one does a sadhana (homam or japam or any ritual) everyday or atleas=\r\nt every weekend, it will tilt the scales in one&#39;s favor over the time and s=\r\ntart fixing material problems and enabling one&#39;s spiritual evolution.\n\n \n\nI=\r\nf one has access and is able to engage a priest everyday or every weekend, =\r\nwhat you said is a fine strategy.\n\n \n\n*        *        *\n\n \n\n&gt; One point I=\r\n want to make is that priests may have fallen just like rest\n\n&gt; of us , but=\r\n they are also human living in the same world or rather same\n\n&gt; Yuga as we =\r\nare! I feel a priest with reasonable desires of taking care\n\n&gt; of his daily=\r\n needs and his family need not be shunned although he is\n\n&gt; doing rituals f=\r\nor the sake of money/tips/gifts.\n\n \n\nAbsolutely. We should have nothing aga=\r\ninst them. Giving them money or helping them or engaging them is perfectly =\r\nnoble. My only point is that *most* (though not all) of them have no abilit=\r\ny to give a boost to the material and spiritual pursuit of others (like man=\r\ny priests of old days did) and hence people should not leave the remedying =\r\nof their problem completely to the priest (they are very likely to be disap=\r\npointed that way). If they realize that they are on their own and do someth=\r\ning about it, they are more likely to succeed over time.\n\n \n\n*        *    =\r\n    *\n\n \n\nJyotisha readings that you talk about the end are a different bal=\r\nl game. They are mostly an intellectual exercise and can be done well by on=\r\ne without spiritual energy. But, doing a ritual for someone and giving a bo=\r\nost to one&#39;s material and spiritual pursuits (using one&#39;s own spiritual ene=\r\nrgy by using the ritual as a tool) is a spiritual exercise and one without =\r\na good level of spiritual energy cannot do it well. These days, people hard=\r\nly have enough spiritual energy to fix their own blockages and how can they=\r\n take care of others?\n\n \n\n*        *        *\n\n \n\n&gt; I apologize if I offend=\r\ned you.

I feel a priest with reasonable desires of =\r\ntaking care\n\n&gt; of his daily needs and his family need not be shunned althou=\r\ngh he is\n\n&gt; doing rituals for the sake of money/tips/gifts. When we do ritu=\r\nals for\n\n&gt; the sake of fulfulling our desires I see no harm in priest doing=\r\n the\n\n&gt; same for his personal gains. He has put in so much of efforts memor=\r\nizing\n\n&gt; tons of Vedic verses , procedures and rituals. In the old days peo=\r\nple\n\n&gt; used to take care of priests and make donations to priests. In today=\r\n&#39;s\n\n&gt; democratic world priest has bills to pay and make ends meet with this=\r\n\n\n&gt; earnings!  The government does not care much about them.How should he\n\n=\r\n&gt; survive ?\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; You have provided details on how homam should be done an=\r\nd also gave very\n\n&gt; valid reasons on why it will not have negative effects =\r\nwhen done with\n\n&gt; sincerity, humilty and with a sense of surrender. That&#39;s =\r\nwonderful and\n\n&gt; it&#39;s great deal of information for people who have reserva=\r\ntions on doing\n\n&gt; homam by themselves.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; I would still go to a priest =\r\nfor doing homam. Why ?\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Instead of going through an online manual I g=\r\net a live person with\n\n&gt; experience who can help me setup the homam the ing=\r\nredients needed. Note\n\n&gt; that most priests these days let YOU participate i=\r\nn the homam and\n\n&gt; constantly guide you on every aspect of the homam. It ju=\r\nst makes it more\n\n&gt; convenient. Utimately its my sincerity, devotion and at=\r\ntitude that\n\n&gt; matters to the diety being invoked in the homam. I also get =\r\nthe\n\n&gt; satisfaction of helping out the priest by using his services and thu=\r\ns\n\n&gt; supporting the priest community. I was born in a Brahman family , rath=\r\ner\n\n&gt; I was born in a family whose ancestors were Brahmans. My father had a=\r\n\n\n&gt; full time job and I&#39;m a software engineer working for a paycheck. So as=\r\n\n\n&gt; you can see clearly neither my father nor myself qualify to be a\n\n&gt; Bra=\r\nhmans. Quite frankly , I see sons of priests today do not want to\n\n&gt; become=\r\n priests anymore. They want to get into college, get degrees and\n\n&gt; get a j=\r\nob! So in my humble opinion we need to support the priests as\n\n&gt; much. The =\r\ncurrent generation of priests may not be great Sadhakas, but\n\n&gt; you must gi=\r\nve it to them for still continuing to do what they are doing.\n\n&gt; Me and my =\r\nfamily have had good experiences with priests although I agree\n\n&gt; there are=\r\n greedy ones out there.  Its a mattery of finding the right\n\n&gt; priest.\n\n&gt; \n=\r\n\n&gt; Same goes with Jyotishis. A full time Jyotishi (I&#39;m talking about \n\n&gt; ge=\r\nnuine Jyotishis like yourself or Shri KN Rao and his advanced\n\n&gt; students) =\r\nwho has put tons and tons of efforts in learning Jyotish and\n\n&gt; continue to=\r\n do so.

But I am trying make one more crucial point. Let m=\r\ne make it\n\n&gt; using an analogy.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; Atleast in US, we have child-proof=\r\n scissors that cut paper/cloth but\n\n&gt; do not cut the finger even if a child=\r\n accidentally puts finger in it.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; In an age when children did not =\r\nneed to use scissors and parents did\n\n&gt; scissors work for them, these kind =\r\nof scissors weren&#39;t needed. Now, with\n\n&gt; parents being busy or otherwise un=\r\nable to help, children need to use\n\n&gt; scissors for their homework sometimes=\r\n. So the market came up with\n\n&gt; child-proof scissors that are safe and do n=\r\not cut fingers.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; Simialrly, remedies were done by trained experts =\r\n(priests) in the\n\n&gt; past. As the priest class started to become weak and un=\r\nable to help\n\n&gt; laymen, Nature is evolving things so that laymen are enable=\r\nd and safely\n\n&gt; too.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; In the old days, ruling ksha=\r\ntriya class contained very dharmik kings\n\n&gt; who were unselfish and used the=\r\n power and authority vested in them to\n\n&gt; provide prosperity to their subje=\r\ncts and render selfless justice. As\n\n&gt; Kali yuga advanced and the kshatriya=\r\n class became selfish, self-serving\n\n&gt; and incapable, Nature gave rise to a=\r\nn evolution and people became\n\n&gt; responsible for governing themselves. King=\r\ns who rule for their entire\n\n&gt; life are slowly fading away from the surface=\r\n of earth and democracy is\n\n&gt; taking root everywhere, where kings change in=\r\n every few years.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, priest class of old days contained g=\r\nenuine braahmanas who\n\n&gt; did sadhana, realized god and were selfless and us=\r\ned the energy they\n\n&gt; accumulated through sadhana to provide prosperity, ma=\r\nterial and\n\n&gt; spiritual, to people around them selflessly. As Kali yuga adv=\r\nances and\n\n&gt; the braahmana class becomes selfish, self-serving and incapabl=\r\ne, Nature\n\n&gt; is giving rise to an evolution and people are responsible for =\r\ntheir own\n\n&gt; remedies and sadhana for material prosperity and spiritual evo=\r\nlution.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; But it is not so bad. Nature is very kind. Nature makes e=\r\nasy and safe\n\n&gt; tools available to laymen before its tells them &quot;you&#39;re on =\r\nyour own&quot;.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; People are suffering from terrible mat=\r\nerial problems now-a-days and\n\n&gt; also starving for good spiritual direction=\r\n.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; Based on old habits, they instinctively expect someone else to =\r\nfix\n\n&gt; their problems. They think that getting a pooja or homam done by a\n\n=\r\n&gt; priest for a couple of hours oneday or getting a &quot;charged&quot; yantra and\n\n&gt; =\r\nrudraksha maalaa will magically cure their problems. Unfortunately, it\n\n&gt; i=\r\ns not so simple today. If there is a sadhaka who does enough sadhana\n\n&gt; and=\r\n &quot;charges&quot; an object such as a yantra or a maalaa or an idol with\n\n&gt; that e=\r\nnergy and gives it to you, you can indeed benefit from it. But\n\n&gt; gone are =\r\nthose days and gone are those people. Remember, you&#39;re on your\n\n&gt; own!\n\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n\n&gt; &gt; Forget special yantras, forget special maalaas, forget special idols,=\r\n\n\n&gt; and forget rituals done by priests. Have faith, have confidence and do\n=\r\n\n&gt; sadhana by yourself on a regular basis.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; The most effective and=\r\n safest sadhana to do by oneself is homam (fire\n\n&gt; ritual). Download the ho=\r\nmam manuals (see site below) and try a homam on\n\n&gt; a regular basis.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Or pick a mantra and do japam with it mentally everyday for an hour or\n\n=\r\n&gt; so, while sitting still with closed eyes and an erect back. If your\n\n&gt; kn=\r\nees hurt, sit on a chair or sofa comfortably, but keep the back\n\n&gt; straight=\r\n and eyes closed.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; There are many generic mantras =\r\n(see my original mail at the bottom for\n\n&gt; a sample list) that are appliabl=\r\ne to everybody and can solve ALL\n\n&gt; problems. For example, Vishnu sahasrana=\r\nama stotra explicitly says it can\n\n&gt; solve ANY problem. Instead of looking =\r\nfor a &quot;perfect mantra\n\n&gt; recommendation&quot;, you can pick a generic mantra lik=\r\ne that and start\n\n&gt; sadhana. The key is faith and persistence.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; If=\r\n your kaarmik blockage is the size of a rock, small amount energy\n\n&gt; may be=\r\n enough to move it away. If it is the size of a big boulder on the\n\n&gt; other=\r\n hand, much more energy may be needed.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; All that is in your hands =\r\nis to do sadhana with faith and persistence.\n\n&gt; And, remember, no effort is=\r\n ever wasted. Every effort bears a fruit of\n\n&gt; comparable size eventually.\n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; Of course, you may be looking for a shortcut, but there is NONE. =\r\nAnd\n\n&gt; sadhana is not so bad. Even before it solves your actual problem, th=\r\ne\n\n&gt; first thing sadhana does to you is: it gives you the courage to face t=\r\nhe\n\n&gt; problem.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing sadhana and selfless surre=\r\nnder to the supreme being\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is of course ideal, but not tenable in the=\r\n current times\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the majority of the humans.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; Nothing is =\r\nuntenable. Though selfless surrender makes sadhana more\n\n&gt; efficient, sadha=\r\nna without selfless surrender is also fine!\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; Even if one&#39;s mind is=\r\n filled with reasonable material desires\n\n&gt; (marriage, children, job, healt=\r\nh etc), one can still do sadhana. Sadhana\n\n&gt; then takes care of one&#39;s mater=\r\nial and spiritual needs and increases\n\n&gt; surrender and selflessness in one =\r\n*over the time*.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; Bottomline: Good sadhana increases selfless surr=\r\nender and selfless\n\n&gt; surrender promotes better sadhana. This is a positive=\r\n feedback loop. One\n\n&gt; should somehow or the other break through. Break the=\r\n impasse and just\n\n&gt; start some sadhana. Don&#39;t fear that something bad will=\r\n happen or that\n\n&gt; you will not be able to do it. Just pick a sadhana and t=\r\nake the plunge!\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And we need well-meaning people=\r\n who are immersed in sadhana\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves to come forward and show us =\r\nthe way.\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; That is what we are trying to do here..\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; Every mandala in RigVeda starts with hymns to Fire. Fire was\n\n&gt; w=\r\norshipped by ancient people such as Zorostrains, Vedic rishis and\n\n&gt; ancien=\r\nt Greco-Romans.

And som=\r\ne intelligent people stopped believing in god\n\n&gt; and in remedies. Let me fi=\r\nrst address why this has come to be and then\n\n&gt; talk about what we should d=\r\no.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In ancient times, caste system was not as rigi=\r\nd as it is\n\n&gt; today. One&#39;s varna was decided based on one&#39;s aptitude. One p=\r\nrimarily\n\n&gt; interested in knowledge and spiritual progress would be a Brahm=\r\nana. One\n\n&gt; primarily interested in power, authority and control over other=\r\ns would\n\n&gt; be a Kshatriya. One primarily interested in money would be a Vai=\r\nsya. One\n\n&gt; primarily interested in physical pleasures would be a Shudra. O=\r\nne would\n\n&gt; start off with the varna of one&#39;s father, as that is what one i=\r\ns exposed\n\n&gt; to in childhood. However, as one&#39;s vasana (mental conditioning=\r\n) blooms,\n\n&gt; one would get one&#39;s own varna. One born a Shudra like Valmiki,=\r\n for\n\n&gt; example, can later turn into a Braahmana and become a Maharshi. One=\r\n born\n\n&gt; a Kshatriya like Viswamitra, for example, can later turn into a Br=\r\nahmana\n\n&gt; and become a Maharshi.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days,=\r\n there were true Brahmanas, who would only be\n\n&gt; interested in knowledge an=\r\nd spiritual progress and not caring about\n\n&gt; power, influence, money, pleas=\r\nures etc. Such Brahmanas became quite pure\n\n&gt; and accumulated enough spirit=\r\nual energy through continuous sadhana over\n\n&gt; years and were capable of per=\r\nforming very effective poojas for people.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Today, =\r\npeople who have spiritual potential may be born in\n\n&gt; non-Brahmana families=\r\n and not allowed to develop fully due to the rigid\n\n&gt; caste structures. Som=\r\ne people born in Brahmana families may also end up\n\n&gt; getting into modern c=\r\nareers and not developing fully as Brahmanas. Some\n\n&gt; people may be born in=\r\n Brahmana families with Kshatriya/Vaisya/Shudra\n\n&gt; tendencies and may end u=\r\np becoming priests who are interested in power,\n\n&gt; authority and control ov=\r\ner others, money and physical pleasures. Those\n\n&gt; priests who only care abo=\r\nut knowledge and spiritual progress (i.e. true\n\n&gt; Brahmanas) are very rare.=\r\n As a result, Brahmanas who have done genuine\n\n&gt; sadhana and accumulated a =\r\ngood amount of spiritual energy are so few.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *=\r\n\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one has one million dollars in one&#39;s bank acc=\r\nount, a check\n\n&gt; given by one for thousand dollars is meaningful. If one&#39;s =\r\nbank account\n\n&gt; is empty, what good is a thousand dollar check given by one=\r\n? It will\n\n&gt; bounce. Similarly, poojas done and blessings given by a priest=\r\n without\n\n&gt; enough spiritual energy cannot bring one any benefits.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One important note: The power is not in a combination of\n=\r\n\n&gt; syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). The power=\r\n\n\n&gt; is in the MIND that FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a=\r\n\n\n&gt; sequence of physical actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind\n\n&gt;=\r\n overcomes its tendency to wander and instead focuses on one thing.\n\n&gt; Diff=\r\nerent mantras and rituals as the focus points may generate different\n\n&gt; kin=\r\nds of energy, but the key is focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual\n\n&gt; prod=\r\nuces anything. Focus comes with a lot of practice. Most priests are\n\n&gt; just=\r\n engaging in casual practice when they go and do poojas. In the old\n\n&gt; days=\r\n, priests did intense sadhana and brought that energy to the table\n\n&gt; when =\r\nthey did rituals at the houses of people or in temples.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; I did see priests who have done good sadhana, purified\n\n&gt; themselves=\r\n and carry some spiritual energy. But those are getting rarer\n\n&gt; and rarer =\r\nnow-a-days. One can most certainly not bank on finding such a\n\n&gt; priest.\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Given this, one is =\r\nbetter off not depending on the\n\n&gt; priest/Brahmana class for remedies. BTW,=\r\n I have nothing against the\n\n&gt; &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; class, having been born =\r\nin an orthodox Brahmana\n\n&gt; family myself. I have neither love nor hatred fo=\r\nr the &quot;Brahmana by\n\n&gt; birth&quot; class. My only wish is that more people - from=\r\n any birth caste -\n\n&gt; develop into true Brahmanas.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Instead of a Brahmana-by-birth who is possibly proud of his\n\n&gt; skills and=\r\n thinking about money and possibly not identifying with your\n\n&gt; trouble, yo=\r\nu can do the mantra/ritual yourself. Atleast your\n\n&gt; identification with th=\r\ne trouble and your desire to solve the problem\n\n&gt; will be better than the p=\r\nriest. If you manage to generate enough focus\n\n&gt; after practice, the mantra=\r\n/ritual may actually produce some result.\n\n&gt; There is no harm in trying.\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many people think t=\r\nhat poojas to gods are a serious matter and\n\n&gt; only a trained priest should=\r\n do them. The procedures have evolved to\n\n&gt; become quite complicated over t=\r\nhe time too!\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, complexity of rituals shoul=\r\nd never be a deterrent.\n\n&gt; Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 cal=\r\nories everyday, 40 grams\n\n&gt; of protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Sup=\r\npose you have no access\n\n&gt; to such balanced food. Will you starve yourself =\r\nuntil you find a\n\n&gt; balanced meal or will you manage with whatever you have=\r\n? If you just\n\n&gt; have a bowl of dal (lentil soup) and rice, you will simply=\r\n eat it. You\n\n&gt; atleast get some energy.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarl=\r\ny, if you do not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a\n\n&gt; mantra/ritual, you need =\r\nnot wait till you know the perfect way. You can\n\n&gt; start with what you know=\r\n. It will only give you energy.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The fear to do rituals without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems fro=\r\nm\n\n&gt; the notion that some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion is\n=\r\n\n&gt; not totally baseless, but it is irrelevant today.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; It is possible to focus the mind on some mantras and rituals\n\n&gt; and get=\r\n specific results. When used by someone with a high level of\n\n&gt; spiritual e=\r\nnergy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast and give\n\n&gt; specific pow=\r\nerful results. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almost)\n\n&gt; such things=\r\n in this age.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will give an analogy. A machine g=\r\nun and a stick can be used\n\n&gt; to attack enemies. Stick is safe to use, but,=\r\n one using a machine gun\n\n&gt; needs to be very careful. One needs to learn we=\r\nll, practice well and\n\n&gt; then use it, lest one should hurt oneself by accid=\r\nent.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, suppose the house lord purposely re=\r\nmoved ammunition\n\n&gt; from the machine gun. Then it is used just like a stick=\r\n and not risky.\n\n&gt; Instead of waiting for perfect instructions on how to us=\r\ne the machine\n\n&gt; gun, just take it and start beating your enemies with it.\n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Ammunition&quot; has purposely been removed from most=\r\n targeted\n\n&gt; mantras and rituals (machine guns) in this age. Instead of wai=\r\nting for\n\n&gt; perfect knowledge, one can start using them right away.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A lot of technicalities related to mantras and rituals a=\r\nre\n\n&gt; irrelevant today. Mantras and rituals are to be taken up with faith,\n=\r\n\n&gt; devotion and surrender to god. Whatever technicalities one can\n\n&gt; realis=\r\ntically follow should be followed and emphasis should be placed on\n\n&gt; devot=\r\nion and surrender. If one keeps doing sadhana, eventually one&#39;s\n\n&gt; devotion=\r\n and focus will improve and, for all you know, a result may\n\n&gt; come.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Given that we do not have perfect focus and surrender, =\r\nwe\n\n&gt; cannot expect specific results to come in specific counts of recitati=\r\non.\n\n&gt; So we should just do the best job we can and leave the result to god=\r\n,\n\n&gt; who decides when and what result should be given.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that no effort is wasted in the end. Every\n\n&gt; sincere e=\r\nffort generates some fruit or the other, sometime or the\n\n&gt; other!!!\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Different mantras and r=\r\nituals are like begging bowls of\n\n&gt; different shapes. They matter only so m=\r\nuch. Depending on what kind of a\n\n&gt; begging bowl you use, you may be given =\r\ndifferent kind of alms. But it is\n\n&gt; important to start begging with some b=\r\negging bowl or the other, instead\n\n&gt; of spending years looking for the perf=\r\nect begging bowl.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead of waiting for astrolog=\r\ners with half-baked or\n\n&gt; ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfect m=\r\nantra or ritual, do\n\n&gt; what your heart tells you or what your guru (or an e=\r\nlder you respect)\n\n&gt; tells you. Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva panchaks=\r\nhari mantra,\n\n&gt; Vishnu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha, Hanu=\r\nman chalisa,\n\n&gt; Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu&#39;s\n\n&gt; shadakshari/ashtaksh=\r\nari/dwadasakshari mantra, Venkateswara&#39;s\n\n&gt; ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantr=\r\na, hare krishna mantra, Chandipath (Durga\n\n&gt; saptashati), Durga saptashloki=\r\n, Lalita sahasranaama stotra, Vyasa&#39;s\n\n&gt; navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam,=\r\n Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaama stotra\n\n&gt; etc are *generic* and can work for =\r\nanyone for any purpose.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do not waste time looking=\r\n for a perfect recommendation,\n\n&gt; perfect procedure, perfect muhurta etc an=\r\nd just do some sadhana or the\n\n&gt; other with a sincere heart.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your effort will not go waste. Your problem may be solved or\n\n&gt;=\r\n you may overcome your situation and stop worrying, or atleast your focus\n\n=\r\n&gt; will improve.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\nn this context, I want to say a few words about homam, the\n\n&gt; sadhana of ri=\r\nshis.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fire ritual is found in many ancient religi=\r\nons. Unlike the\n\n&gt; elements of earth, water and air, fire is ever pure and =\r\nit purifies\n\n&gt; whatever it comes in contact with. The Sanskrit name for fir=\r\ne is\n\n&gt; paavaka, i.e. purifier. Fire is a living god that everyone has acce=\r\nss\n\n&gt; to. Spending time worshipping god through fire purifies one&#39;s subtle\n=\r\n\n&gt; consciousness. Homam is far more effective than most other sadhanas in\n\n=\r\n&gt; improving one&#39;s focus, changing one&#39;s inner personality and removing\n\n&gt; m=\r\naterial and spiritual obstacles. One need not take my words for\n\n&gt; granted.=\r\n One can try for oneself for a few months. The proof of the\n\n&gt; pudding is i=\r\nn eating it.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vedic seers (rishis) performed homam=\r\n regularly, for the\n\n&gt; benefit of the world. When composing the Jyotish mas=\r\nterpiece &quot;Brihat\n\n&gt; Paaraasara Horaa Saastram&quot; just before the advent of Ka=\r\nli yuga, for\n\n&gt; guidance to the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara reco=\r\nmmended\n\n&gt; various types of homam as remedial measures for various problems=\r\n in the\n\n&gt; horoscope. In fact, most remedies he recommended involve homam. =\r\nParasara\n\n&gt; asked to follow whatever procedures one was taught for starting=\r\n fire and\n\n&gt; did not focus on the nitty gritty of homam. He only gave the m=\r\nain mantra\n\n&gt; to beused in homam. Parasara&#39;s clear teachings set to rest th=\r\ne notion\n\n&gt; that some people have, that homam is not for Kali yuga.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Kr=\r\nishna said, &quot;yaGYaanaaM\n\n&gt; japayaGYo.asmi&quot;, i.e. I am japa among all sacrif=\r\nices. Some people use\n\n&gt; this line to suggest that japam (meditation) is su=\r\nperior to homa/yajna.\n\n&gt; Let me put that in perspective.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the line just above that line, Sri Krishna also said, &quot;I am\n\n&gt; O=\r\nm among all mantras&quot;. However, do we only meditate with the supreme\n\n&gt; mant=\r\nra &quot;Om&quot; and leave all other mantras?\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one says =\r\nthat sitting on the pinnacle is the best part of\n\n&gt; climbing a mountain, it=\r\n does not mean that the process of climbing it\n\n&gt; using various kinds of ge=\r\nar is useless. In fact, one needs that process\n\n&gt; to reach the pinnacle. Mo=\r\nst cannot reach the pinnacle directly.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly,=\r\n Om is the supreme of all mantras being the source\n\n&gt; of all, but reaching =\r\nthe source may require using several mantras first\n\n&gt; to purify oneself. Me=\r\nditating and absorbing consciousness in the Supreme\n\n&gt; (japa) may be the su=\r\npreme sacrifice, but it may require purification and\n\n&gt; preparation by enga=\r\nging in other kinds of sacrifices (hama/yajna).\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; W=\r\nhen one does homam or yajna, one is engaging in external\n\n&gt; actions and one=\r\n is unlikely to reach samadhi (absorbption in the\n\n&gt; Supreme). When a perfe=\r\nctly purified person does japam (i.e. sits still\n\n&gt; and contemplates), one =\r\nmay reach samadhi. However, to purify oneself,\n\n&gt; homam is far more effecti=\r\nve.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Detailed manu=\r\nals giving short procedures for doing various\n\n&gt; types of homam by oneself =\r\nare available on the website given below. You\n\n&gt; can use the resources on t=\r\nhat website to perform several kinds of short\n\n&gt; homam by yourself.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now *hundreds* of people are performing homam by themsel=\r\nves\n\n&gt; either daily or weekly. Some people are also doing monthly.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Manish (my spiritual guru - a small write-up on him =\r\ncan\n\n&gt; be read in message 3481 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, i.e.\n\n&gt; http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481) told me that\n\n&gt; the Divine=\r\n Mother appeared before him during Shata Chandi homam at a\n\n&gt; temple in Che=\r\nnnai in March 2006, directed him to spread a simplified\n\n&gt; homam ritual aro=\r\nund the world, and showed him that hundreds of thousands\n\n&gt; of people would=\r\n be performing regular homam in a few years, thus helping\n\n&gt; reverse the de=\r\ncay of Dharma and Truth on earth, it seemed quite\n\n&gt; far-fetched to my rati=\r\nonal mind.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, just 4 years after the Mother=\r\n&#39;s command, hundreds of\n\n&gt; people are already performing regular homam. Tho=\r\nugh these are just the\n\n&gt; early days, the developments are amazing. Some of=\r\n them are laymen who\n\n&gt; never even lit a lamp and did not know how to do AN=\r\nY pooja or ritual. It\n\n&gt; is a miracle that such people are doing a homam ev=\r\neryday, like the\n\n&gt; rishis and Brahmanas of yore. I also know personally th=\r\nat some people\n\n&gt; doing homam for a couple of years are actually starting t=\r\no experience\n\n&gt; things within and outside and, more importantly, going thro=\r\nugh rapid\n\n&gt; internal transformation.\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am neither a missionary nor a mercenary.

Note&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nthat most priests these days let YOU participate in the homam and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nconstantly guide you on every aspect of the homam. It just makes it more&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; convenient.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nThe catch is this: Doing a one-off homam (or a=\r\nny ritual) once every 6 months or so is unlikely to cause any considerable =\r\nmaterial or spiritual benefit. Given the kind of kaarmik blockages most peo=\r\nple have, persistent sadhana over a period of time is needed and one event =\r\ncannot fix things.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nAs one does a sadhana (homam or japam or any r=\r\nitual) everyday or atleast every weekend, it will tilt the scales in one&#39;s =\r\nfavor over the time and start fixing material problems and enabling one&#39;s s=\r\npiritual evolution.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nIf one has access and is able to engage a pri=\r\nest everyday or every weekend, what you said is a fine strategy.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One point I want to make is that priests=\r\n may have fallen just like rest&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of us , but they are also human li=\r\nving in the same world or rather same&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Yuga as we are! I feel a pri=\r\nest with reasonable desires of taking care&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of his daily needs and =\r\nhis family need not be shunned although he is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; doing rituals for th=\r\ne sake of money/tips/gifts.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nAbsolutely. We should have nothing ag=\r\nainst them. Giving them money or helping them or engaging them is perfectly=\r\n noble. My only point is that *most* (though not all) of them have no abili=\r\nty to give a boost to the material and spiritual pursuit of others (like ma=\r\nny priests of old days did) and hence people should not leave the remedying=\r\n of their problem completely to the priest (they are very likely to be disa=\r\nppointed that way). If they realize that they are on their own and do somet=\r\nhing about it, they are more likely to succeed over time.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n*      =\r\n  *        *&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nJyotisha readings that you talk about the end are a =\r\ndifferent ball game. They are mostly an intellectual exercise and can be do=\r\nne well by one without spiritual energy. But, doing a ritual for someone an=\r\nd giving a boost to one&#39;s material and spiritual pursuits (using one&#39;s own =\r\nspiritual energy by using the ritual as a tool) is a spiritual exercise and=\r\n one without a good level of spiritual energy cannot do it well.

I fe=\r\nel a priest with reasonable desires of taking care&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of his daily ne=\r\neds and his family need not be shunned although he is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; doing ritual=\r\ns for the sake of money/tips/gifts. When we do rituals for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the sak=\r\ne of fulfulling our desires I see no harm in priest doing the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; same=\r\n for his personal gains. He has put in so much of efforts memorizing&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; tons of Vedic verses , procedures and rituals. In the old days people&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; used to take care of priests and make donations to priests. In today=\r\n&#39;s&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; democratic world priest has bills to pay and make ends meet wit=\r\nh this&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; earnings!  The government does not care much about them.How=\r\n should he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; survive ?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; You have provided details =\r\non how homam should be done and also gave very&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; valid reasons on wh=\r\ny it will not have negative effects when done with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sincerity, humi=\r\nlty and with a sense of surrender. That&#39;s wonderful and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; it&#39;s great=\r\n deal of information for people who have reservations on doing&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; hom=\r\nam by themselves.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I would still go to a priest for doing=\r\n homam. Why ?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Instead of going through an online manual =\r\nI get a live person with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; experience who can help me setup the homa=\r\nm the ingredients needed. Note&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that most priests these days let YO=\r\nU participate in the homam and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; constantly guide you on every aspec=\r\nt of the homam. It just makes it more&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; convenient. Utimately its my=\r\n sincerity, devotion and attitude that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; matters to the diety being =\r\ninvoked in the homam. I also get the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; satisfaction of helping out t=\r\nhe priest by using his services and thus&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; supporting the priest com=\r\nmunity. I was born in a Brahman family , rather&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I was born in a fa=\r\nmily whose ancestors were Brahmans. My father had a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; full time job =\r\nand I&#39;m a software engineer working for a paycheck. So as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; you can =\r\nsee clearly neither my father nor myself qualify to be a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Brahmans.=\r\n Quite frankly , I see sons of priests today do not want to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; become=\r\n priests anymore. They want to get into college, get degrees and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; g=\r\net a job! So in my humble opinion we need to support the priests as&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; much. The current generation of priests may not be great Sadhakas, but&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; you must give it to them for still continuing to do what they are do=\r\ning.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Me and my family have had good experiences with priests altho=\r\nugh I agree&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; there are greedy ones out there.  Its a mattery of fin=\r\nding the right&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; priest.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Same goes with Jyotishis=\r\n. A full time Jyotishi (I&#39;m talking about &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; genuine Jyotishis like =\r\nyourself or Shri KN Rao and his advanced&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; students) who has put ton=\r\ns and tons of efforts in learning Jyotish and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; continue to do so.

But I am trying make one more crucial point. Let=\r\n me make it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; using an analogy.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Atleast =\r\nin US, we have child-proof scissors that cut paper/cloth but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; do no=\r\nt cut the finger even if a child accidentally puts finger in it.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In an age when children did not need to use scissors and =\r\nparents did&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; scissors work for them, these kind of scissors weren&#39;t=\r\n needed. Now, with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; parents being busy or otherwise unable to help,=\r\n children need to use&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; scissors for their homework sometimes. So th=\r\ne market came up with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; child-proof scissors that are safe and do no=\r\nt cut fingers.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Simialrly, remedies were done by=\r\n trained experts (priests) in the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; past. As the priest class starte=\r\nd to become weak and unable to help&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; laymen, Nature is evolving thi=\r\nngs so that laymen are enabled and safely&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; too.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; In the old days, ruling kshatriy=\r\na class contained very dharmik kings&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; who were unselfish and used t=\r\nhe power and authority vested in them to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; provide prosperity to the=\r\nir subjects and render selfless justice. As&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Kali yuga advanced and=\r\n the kshatriya class became selfish, self-serving&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and incapable, N=\r\nature gave rise to an evolution and people became&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; responsible for =\r\ngoverning themselves. Kings who rule for their entire&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; life are slo=\r\nwly fading away from the surface of earth and democracy is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; taking =\r\nroot everywhere, where kings change in every few years.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; Similarly, priest class of old days contained genuine braahmanas w=\r\nho&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; did sadhana, realized god and were selfless and used the energy=\r\n they&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; accumulated through sadhana to provide prosperity, material =\r\nand&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; spiritual, to people around them selflessly. As Kali yuga adva=\r\nnces and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the braahmana class becomes selfish, self-serving and inc=\r\napable, Nature&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is giving rise to an evolution and people are respo=\r\nnsible for their own&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; remedies and sadhana for material prosperity =\r\nand spiritual evolution.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; But it is not so bad. =\r\nNature is very kind. Nature makes easy and safe&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; tools available to=\r\n laymen before its tells them &quot;you&#39;re on your own&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; People are suffering from terrible m=\r\naterial problems now-a-days and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; also starving for good spiritual d=\r\nirection.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Based on old habits, they instinctive=\r\nly expect someone else to fix&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; their problems. They think that gett=\r\ning a pooja or homam done by a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; priest for a couple of hours oneday=\r\n or getting a &quot;charged&quot; yantra and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; rudraksha maalaa will magically=\r\n cure their problems. Unfortunately, it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is not so simple today. If=\r\n there is a sadhaka who does enough sadhana&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and &quot;charges&quot; an objec=\r\nt such as a yantra or a maalaa or an idol with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that energy and giv=\r\nes it to you, you can indeed benefit from it. But&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; gone are those d=\r\nays and gone are those people. Remember, you&#39;re on your&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; own!&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Forget special yantras, forget special maalaas, forg=\r\net special idols,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and forget rituals done by priests. Have faith, =\r\nhave confidence and do&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sadhana by yourself on a regular basis.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The most effective and safest sadhana to do by one=\r\nself is homam (fire&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ritual). Download the homam manuals (see site =\r\nbelow) and try a homam on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a regular basis.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Or pick a mantra and do japam with it mentally everyday for an hour or=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; so, while sitting still with closed eyes and an erect back. If yo=\r\nur&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; knees hurt, sit on a chair or sofa comfortably, but keep the ba=\r\nck&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; straight and eyes closed.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are many generic mantras (see my original ma=\r\nil at the bottom for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; a sample list) that are appliable to everybod=\r\ny and can solve ALL&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; problems. For example, Vishnu sahasranaama sto=\r\ntra explicitly says it can&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; solve ANY problem. Instead of looking f=\r\nor a &quot;perfect mantra&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; recommendation&quot;, you can pick a generic mantr=\r\na like that and start&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sadhana. The key is faith and persistence.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If your kaarmik blockage is the size of a rock, =\r\nsmall amount energy&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; may be enough to move it away. If it is the si=\r\nze of a big boulder on the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; other hand, much more energy may be nee=\r\nded.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; All that is in your hands is to do sadhana=\r\n with faith and persistence.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; And, remember, no effort is ever wast=\r\ned. Every effort bears a fruit of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; comparable size eventually.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, you may be looking for a shortcut, but t=\r\nhere is NONE. And&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sadhana is not so bad. Even before it solves you=\r\nr actual problem, the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; first thing sadhana does to you is: it gives=\r\n you the courage to face the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; problem.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n* * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing sadhana and selfless surrender=\r\n to the supreme being&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is of course ideal, but not tenabl=\r\ne in the current times&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the majority of the humans.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nothing is untenable. Though selfless surrender =\r\nmakes sadhana more&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; efficient, sadhana without selfless surrender i=\r\ns also fine!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even if one&#39;s mind is filled with =\r\nreasonable material desires&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (marriage, children, job, health etc),=\r\n one can still do sadhana. Sadhana&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; then takes care of one&#39;s materi=\r\nal and spiritual needs and increases&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; surrender and selflessness in=\r\n one *over the time*.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bottomline: Good sadhana =\r\nincreases selfless surrender and selfless&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; surrender promotes bette=\r\nr sadhana. This is a positive feedback loop. One&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; should somehow or=\r\n the other break through. Break the impasse and just&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; start some sa=\r\ndhana. Don&#39;t fear that something bad will happen or that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; you will =\r\nnot be able to do it. Just pick a sadhana and take the plunge!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And we need well-mea=\r\nning people who are immersed in sadhana&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves to co=\r\nme forward and show us the way.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; That is what we=\r\n are trying to do here..&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Every mandala in RigVeda starts with hymns to Fire. Fire was&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; worshipped by ancient people such as Zorostrains, Vedic rishis and&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; ancient Greco-Romans. Even progressive modern paths such as Buddhis=\r\nm and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Arya Samaj accept fire worship. Fire is a living representat=\r\nion of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; divinity on earth and spending time worshipping god in fire=\r\n has a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; magical and purifying impact on one&#39;s consciousness.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; The proof of the pudding is in eating it. One can try=\r\n homam every day&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; or or every weekend for a few months and see for =\r\noneself what it does to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; one.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best rega=\r\nrds,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotis=\r\nh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals =\r\nfor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;=\r\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms=\r\n.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;=\r\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:JyotishGroup%40yahoogroups.com=\r\n&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3DJyotishGroup%40yahoogroups.com=\r\n&quot;&gt;JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;rohinicrystal&quot; jyotish_vani@&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nwrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; What I read in your posting is the simple fact that=\r\n:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In mature hands, a knife can heal (=\r\nsurgeon&#39;s)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or feed those who choose a=\r\nnimal proteins for whatever reasons&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (Butcher&#39;s)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BUT in immature and evil hands, the same knife would co=\r\nmmit a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; punishable crime (Murderer!)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; So it is not the mantra, ritual but the INTENT and the person who i=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; wielding the knife (III, to keep it simple!) that is important.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I agree fully and hopefully that reso=\r\nnates with what you were trying&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; to express, in a borader and gener=\r\nal sense, at least partly so.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ranjan&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; y=\r\nmailto=3D&quot;mailto:JyotishGroup%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;=\r\n/mc/compose?to=3DJyotishGroup%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;jyotishi&quot; raj@ wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; IMHO f=\r\nor a profession to progress, you need art, science and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; commerce to=\r\n work together in tandem.
