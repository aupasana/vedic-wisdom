Dh=\r\narma often requires judging and balancing different criteria and the judgme=\r\nnt may vary from place to place, time to time and person to person.\n\nUncook=\r\ned (raw) rice grains last a long time without getting spoiled, but cooked r=\r\nice grains get spoiled fast. Unfortunately, people cannot eat raw grains. S=\r\no someone cooks for them. Do not expect cooked grains to last a long time, =\r\neven if a great cook cooked them.\n\nSimilarly, generic and raw spiritual tea=\r\nchings given in scriptures and taught by great yogis (e.g. Brahman alone is=\r\n real. World is maayaa. Do good to others. Sacrifice your happiness for oth=\r\ners) are relevant always, while very specific guidelines given by great yog=\r\nis in specific circumstances (e.g. It is ok to eat fish, but focus mind on =\r\ngod. It is ok to do homam with mustard oil instead of ghee. If someone come=\r\ns to you and asks for money, give whatever you have) may have been given ke=\r\neping the circumstances in mind and may be irrelevant in other circumstance=\r\ns.\n\nIf I reject spoiled food cooked by my wife who is out of town and inste=\r\nad eat food made by my sister-in-law, it is not disrespectful to my wife. S=\r\nhe would not have expected me to hang on to her food and eat it even after =\r\nit expires.\n\nUnfortunately, many great yogis give specific guidelines to pe=\r\nople based on the circumstances (desa-kaala-paatra), as people are not smar=\r\nt enough to know the right thing if given only generic guidelines and want =\r\nspecific guidance. So they run the risk of someone using the guideline mean=\r\nt for a specific circumstance in other inapplicable circumstances while att=\r\nributing it to them.\n\n(2) Eating the meat of an animal that self-identifies=\r\n with the body parts strongly is always a much stronger karma than eating t=\r\nhe stuff from plants that have much subtler self-identification with the le=\r\naves and vegetables they grow. Irrespective of which spiritual giants ate f=\r\nish in the past, it is bad karma.\n\nAll of us do many bad karmas and many go=\r\nod karmas and hope for them balance out. Vivekananda and Ramakrishna did so=\r\n many good karmas, so many austerities and such intense spiritual sadhana. =\r\nIt may have offset any bad karma accumulated by eating fish during the time=\r\n they were not yet fully realized (after full realization, there are no kar=\r\nmas).\n\n(3) In the old days - even a century back - people did much more sad=\r\nhana than now and lived simpler and purer lifestyles. Now-a-days, we live i=\r\nn the middle of deep pollution - physical as well as spiritual - and our mi=\r\nnds are bombarded with so much corrupting influence. One may do a homam in =\r\nthe evening, go and turn on the TV and the sitcom coming on TV during prime=\r\n time may have sexual innuendo. One may check email and get a spam mail abo=\r\nut sexuality. There are images of half-naked people and struggle for money =\r\neverywhere. There are too many temptations for the mind and too many opport=\r\nunities to fall and commit bad karmas (physically or mentally). The world o=\r\nf today is more challenging for a sadhaka than at the time of Vivekananda.\n=\r\n\nHow good shoes one wears may not matter if one is walking on a normal road=\r\n in summer. One should better wear good shoes if one is walking on an icy p=\r\navement during winter, lest one should fall!\n\nWhen there is so much corrupt=\r\ning influence around us that we cannot control and that is challenging us, =\r\nwe can atleast control our own actions and habits and minimize the bad karm=\r\nas we regularly commit and the chance of a fall.\n\n(4) When Lord Vishnu came=\r\n to earth as Lord Rama, he taught the importance of Eka Patni Vrata (having=\r\n only one wife). When he came back as Lord Krishna, he did not emphasize th=\r\nat anymore and had many wives. When he came as Lord Narasimha or Lord Rama,=\r\n he killed demons. When he came as Lord Buddha, he taught non-violence.\n\nWh=\r\nen yogis like Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi, Sai Baba etc come =\r\nalso, their message is tuned for their desa-kaala-paatra. Different times r=\r\nequire different leelas, different missions, different messages and differe=\r\nnt styles.\n\nUnfortunately, Jaambavanta did not recognize when Lord Rama cam=\r\ne back as Lord Krishna and even fought with him!\n\n(5) While it is illogical=\r\n to hold Thakur, Mother and Swamiji accountable for the beliefs of these pe=\r\nople, I admire their blind faith. If it is opportunism, i.e. they just want=\r\n to eat fish and use the icons of their organization as an excuse, that is =\r\nbad. But, if it is genuine blind faith that these icons were perfected bein=\r\ngs and their words are never wrong, they will eventually make it. Opportuni=\r\nstic and egoistic faith is useless, but blind and complete faith accompanie=\r\nd by complete surrender is very powerful. People with such faith WILL find =\r\ntheir way.\n\n(6) The nearest path from Ujjain to Kashi does not go through C=\r\nalcutta. But, if someone insists on going through Calcutta, what can you do=\r\n? Everyone takes a spiritual path based on one&#39;s conditioning. If we see a =\r\nshort path, we can only suggest it to others but nor force them to take it.=\r\n\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyot=\r\nish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tar=\r\npana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wis=\r\ndom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- On=\r\n Fri, 2/5/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\nFrom: rajarshi=\r\n nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Great Vimal=\r\nananda&#39;s opinion on &#39;Meat-eaters&#39;(Aghor -at the left hand of God)\nTo: vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Friday, February 5, 2010, 9:38 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n    \n      \n      \n      Dear KK,\n=C2=A0\nNice question. I was a=\r\nlso thinking that.\n=C2=A0\nFew days back when I went to Calcutta, (where fis=\r\nh is the staple diet), one person told me confidently that there is no harm=\r\n in eating fish or meat because Swamiji used to do so, and in a Bengali boo=\r\nk on the=C2=A0life of Sri Ramakrishna there is one example mentioned where =\r\na man came to ask him if should quite non veg food, and supposedly Ramakris=\r\nhna said first leave &quot;Kamini&quot; and &quot;Kanchana&quot;, then think of food. =C2=A0Als=\r\no a similar examples was quoted to me from=C2=A0the life of Ma Sarada where=\r\n - a certain book says - she advised an ordinary devotee against leaving fi=\r\nsh eating and rather just focus mind on God.\n=C2=A0\nWhen I tried to reason =\r\nwith them that if these people were to come back again on planet earth they=\r\n may not recommend non veg eating - considering the state of the world toda=\r\ny - I=C2=A0 was catergorically told they are all Trikalagyas, so if there i=\r\ns something wrong in eating fish they would have told right then.=C2=A0 \n=\r\n=C2=A0\nThen I tried to say that the examples maybe specific individual case=\r\ns, to which I was told, &quot;no&quot;, because based on a whole plethora of such exa=\r\nmples even today the monks of the Ramakrishna Order in West Bengal eat and =\r\nserve fish. This statement is a fact. I=C2=A0have had fish meals as prasad =\r\nin many Ramakrishna Missions across=C2=A0West Bengal.=C2=A0So, I was told, =\r\nthe monks of the Ramakrishna Oder know about teachings of Ramakrishna and M=\r\na Sarada better than us ordrinary people. \n=C2=A0\nI could make no further a=\r\nrguments and of course had a harrowing time at home trying to convince my p=\r\narents that I have quit non veg food. \n=C2=A0\nA lot of Bengalis may not hav=\r\ne been able to implement the basic teachings of Ramakrishna in their lives,=\r\n however they faithfully follow fish eating as a sanction given by &quot;Thakur&quot;=\r\n and &quot;Sri Sri Ma&quot; and &quot;Swamiji&quot;.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\nPS: =\r\nNo disrespect to anyone.

However, you are free to address me as you feel like and I&#39;ll happi=\r\nly accept it hence forth.\n\nI just came across Vimalananda&#39; s thought on Kar=\r\nma. He says (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is only ge=\r\nnerated (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it.\nAlthough, it may=\r\n seem easy to understand intellectually, the state is multiple times diffic=\r\nult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extremely important statement to answ=\r\ner our queries.\n\nImportant information about Vimalananda which I came to kn=\r\now only yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a sing=\r\nle day passed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day=\r\n of his departure from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; fre=\r\nquently and occasionally\n ate meat. I gave this information, because as you=\r\n pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidence of ex=\r\nact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please also note an important thi=\r\nng. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all his audience to do what h=\r\ne says and not try to do what he does.\n\nNow whatever I wrote above seems su=\r\nfficient to answer the questions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts furth=\r\ner (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can =\r\nbe next to nothing). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vim=\r\nalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we te=\r\nnd to forget that they are all realized souls who achieved very high level =\r\nof spiritual realization. They are knower of everything or many things in t=\r\nhe universe. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to univ=\r\nersal ego. In short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnya=\r\nanis&#39;.\n Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate m=\r\neat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew wh=\r\nat they are doing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind each and=\r\n every action of theirs because as I said, they know complete background be=\r\nhind their each action and moreover their self identification is missing fr=\r\nom the action and hence it is like Nature operates through them to accompli=\r\nsh a special purpose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.\nRamakr=\r\nishna used to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very differ=\r\nent from others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him which c=\r\nan consume anything and everything. A food restriction does not bind him. H=\r\ne can eat anything without getting spiritually troubled but for others, a k=\r\nind of food intake is extremely important.\nIf Vivekananda ate meat during h=\r\nis stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpose which is not\n possib=\r\nle for majority of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of that le=\r\nvel. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere seekers amongst westerne=\r\nrs so that he can be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly try to=\r\n eradicate their habits of meat eating and such other undesirable habits. I=\r\nt is also possible at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced Rin=\r\nanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is also possible that he =\r\nwould have showered his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;s soul by consuming =\r\nits meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no apparent reasons for that but ju=\r\nst a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Gur=\r\nu and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning =\r\nin a lake in USA while he was still in India and did not even planned to go=\r\n to USA. When the boy, after some years actually met Swami in USA for the f=\r\nirst time, swami immediately told him to stay away from water\n and when he =\r\nrequested swami to accept him as his disciple, swami, after a moments thoug=\r\nht told him that he is not his guru and his guru will come later and will g=\r\nive him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later became disciple of Paramhansa =\r\nYogananda and after 40 years, he was actually given a gift of Silver-cup by=\r\n Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 4=\r\n0 years.\n\nSwami Vivekananda was all knowing and most of us are NOT.\n\nSo mor=\r\nal of my whole writings is that it&#39;s unwise as well as self deluding to tak=\r\ne excuses of the unconventional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbab=\r\na, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such ma=\r\nsters and justify our completely self identified and utterly selfish cruel/=\r\nunjust actions.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@\n yahoogroups. =\r\ncom, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@... &gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=C3=82=C2=A0I was about to ask this qu=\r\nestion today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=82=C2=A0 It is clear from the below pass=\r\nage meat eating is not advisable for anyone.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I was=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0reading a book on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he cl=\r\nearly wrote that he survived many days on just eating meat when he was livi=\r\nng in USA also relished it.

How many hu=\r\nmans would give beautiful tender lean meat if they were slaughtered, dresse=\r\nd, prepared and served?\n&gt; Meat-eaters conveniently forget that animal mothe=\r\nrs too love their children. Do they ever think of the agony a hen goes thro=\r\nugh when her chicks are slain in front of her eyes? or a cow, the embodimen=\r\nt of motherliness, do they consider how much she suffers when she sees the =\r\nslaughter of her beloved calf whom she has grown in her own body and nouris=\r\nhed with her milk, whom she loves more than her own life?\n&gt; Do these so cal=\r\nled humans ever think of the terrible pain they cause to mother cow?

Dharma often requires judging and b=\r\nalancing different criteria and the judgment may vary from place to place, =\r\ntime to time and person to person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Uncooked (raw) rice grains last a=\r\n long time without getting spoiled, but cooked rice grains get spoiled fast=\r\n. Unfortunately, people cannot eat raw grains. So someone cooks for them. D=\r\no not expect cooked grains to last a long time, even if a great cook cooked=\r\n them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, generic and raw spiritual teachings given in scrip=\r\ntures and taught by great yogis (e.g. Brahman alone is real. World is maaya=\r\na. Do good to others. Sacrifice your happiness for others) are relevant alw=\r\nays, while very specific guidelines given by great yogis in specific circum=\r\nstances (e.g. It is ok to eat fish, but focus mind on god. It is ok to do\n =\r\nhomam with mustard oil instead of ghee. If someone comes to you and asks fo=\r\nr money, give whatever you have) may have been given keeping the circumstan=\r\nces in mind and may be irrelevant in other circumstances.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If I rejec=\r\nt spoiled food cooked by my wife who is out of town and instead eat food ma=\r\nde by my sister-in-law, it is not disrespectful to my wife. She would not h=\r\nave expected me to hang on to her food and eat it even after it expires.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, many great yogis give specific guidelines to people bas=\r\ned on the circumstances (desa-kaala-paatra), as people are not smart enough=\r\n to know the right thing if given only generic guidelines and want specific=\r\n guidance. So they run the risk of someone using the guideline meant for a =\r\nspecific circumstance in other inapplicable circumstances while attributing=\r\n it to them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(2) Eating the meat of an animal that self-identifies w=\r\nith the body parts strongly is always a much stronger karma than\n eating th=\r\ne stuff from plants that have much subtler self-identification with the lea=\r\nves and vegetables they grow. Irrespective of which spiritual giants ate fi=\r\nsh in the past, it is bad karma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All of us do many bad karmas and ma=\r\nny good karmas and hope for them balance out. Vivekananda and Ramakrishna d=\r\nid so many good karmas, so many austerities and such intense spiritual sadh=\r\nana. It may have offset any bad karma accumulated by eating fish during the=\r\n time they were not yet fully realized (after full realization, there are n=\r\no karmas).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(3) In the old days - even a century back - people did mu=\r\nch more sadhana than now and lived simpler and purer lifestyles. Now-a-days=\r\n, we live in the middle of deep pollution - physical as well as spiritual -=\r\n and our minds are bombarded with so much corrupting influence. One may do =\r\na homam in the evening, go and turn on the TV and the sitcom coming on TV d=\r\nuring prime time may have sexual innuendo. One may check\n email and get a s=\r\npam mail about sexuality. There are images of half-naked people and struggl=\r\ne for money everywhere. There are too many temptations for the mind and too=\r\n many opportunities to fall and commit bad karmas (physically or mentally).=\r\n The world of today is more challenging for a sadhaka than at the time of V=\r\nivekananda.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;How good shoes one wears may not matter if one is walkin=\r\ng on a normal road in summer. One should better wear good shoes if one is w=\r\nalking on an icy pavement during winter, lest one should fall!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When =\r\nthere is so much corrupting influence around us that we cannot control and =\r\nthat is challenging us, we can atleast control our own actions and habits a=\r\nnd minimize the bad karmas we regularly commit and the chance of a fall.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;(4) When Lord Vishnu came to earth as Lord Rama, he taught the importa=\r\nnce of Eka Patni Vrata (having only one wife). When he came back as Lord Kr=\r\nishna, he did not emphasize that anymore and had\n many wives. When he came =\r\nas Lord Narasimha or Lord Rama, he killed demons. When he came as Lord Budd=\r\nha, he taught non-violence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When yogis like Ramakrishna, Vivekananda=\r\n, Ramana Maharshi, Sai Baba etc come also, their message is tuned for their=\r\n desa-kaala-paatra. Different times require different leelas, different mis=\r\nsions, different messages and different styles.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, Jaamb=\r\navanta did not recognize when Lord Rama came back as Lord Krishna and even =\r\nfought with him!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(5) While it is illogical to hold Thakur, Mother an=\r\nd Swamiji accountable for the beliefs of these people, I admire their blind=\r\n faith. If it is opportunism, i.e. they just want to eat fish and use the i=\r\ncons of their organization as an excuse, that is bad. But, if it is genuine=\r\n blind faith that these icons were perfected beings and their words are nev=\r\ner wrong, they will eventually make it. Opportunistic and egoistic faith is=\r\n useless, but blind and complete faith\n accompanied by complete surrender i=\r\ns very powerful. People with such faith WILL find their way.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;(6) The=\r\n nearest path from Ujjain to Kashi does not go through Calcutta. But, if so=\r\nmeone insists on going through Calcutta, what can you do? Everyone takes a =\r\nspiritual path based on one&#39;s conditioning. If we see a short path, we can =\r\nonly suggest it to others but nor force them to take it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regard=\r\ns,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish =\r\nWritings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarp=\r\nana:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ve=\r\ndic-wisdom&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish\n writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyoti=\r\nshWritings&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Fri, 2/5/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;i&gt;&lt;rajarshi14@yahoo=\r\n.co.in&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rg=\r\nb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;From: rajarshi nandy =\r\n&lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Great Vim=\r\nalananda&#39;s opinion on &#39;Meat-eaters&#39;(Aghor -at the left hand of God)&lt;br&gt;To: =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;Date: Friday, February 5, 2010, 9:38 AM&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1421616119&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;table border=3D=\r\n&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;font-family=\r\n: inherit; font-style: inherit; font-variant: inherit; font-weight: inherit=\r\n; font-size: inherit; line-height: inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font=\r\n-stretch: inherit; -x-system-font: none;&quot; valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dear KK,&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Nice question. I was also thinking that.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Few days back when I went to Calcutta, (where fish is t=\r\nhe staple diet), one person told me confidently that there is no harm in ea=\r\nting fish or meat because Swamiji used to do so, and in a Bengali book on t=\r\nhe&nbsp;life of Sri Ramakrishna there is one example mentioned where a man =\r\ncame to ask him if should quite non veg food, and supposedly Ramakrishna sa=\r\nid first leave &quot;Kamini&quot; and &quot;Kanchana&quot;, then think of food. &nbsp;Also a si=\r\nmilar examples was quoted to me from&nbsp;the life of Ma Sarada where - a c=\r\nertain book says - she advised an ordinary devotee against leaving fish eat=\r\ning and rather just focus mind on God.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;When I =\r\ntried to reason with them that if these people were to come back again on p=\r\nlanet earth they may not recommend non veg eating - considering the state o=\r\nf the world today - I&nbsp; was catergorically told they are all Trikalagya=\r\ns, so if there is something wrong in eating fish they would have told right=\r\n then.&nbsp; &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Then I tried to say that the exa=\r\nmples maybe specific individual cases, to which I was told, &quot;no&quot;, because b=\r\nased on a whole plethora of such examples even today the monks of the Ramak=\r\nrishna Order in West Bengal eat and serve fish. This statement is a fact. I=\r\n&nbsp;have had fish meals as prasad in many Ramakrishna Missions across&nbs=\r\np;West Bengal.&nbsp;So, I was told, the monks of the Ramakrishna Oder know =\r\nabout teachings of Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada better than us ordrinary peopl=\r\ne. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I could make no further arguments and of c=\r\nourse had a harrowing time at home trying to convince my parents that I hav=\r\ne quit non veg food. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;A lot of Bengalis may no=\r\nt have been able to implement the basic teachings of Ramakrishna in their l=\r\nives, however they faithfully follow fish eating as a sanction given by &quot;Th=\r\nakur&quot; and &quot;Sri Sri Ma&quot; and &quot;Swamiji&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;PS: No disrespect t=\r\no anyone.

However, you are free to address me as you feel like and I&#39;ll =\r\nhappily accept it hence forth.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I just came across Vimalananda&#39; s tho=\r\nught on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) that Karma=\r\n is only generated (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with it.&lt;br&gt;Al=\r\nthough, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, the state is multipl=\r\ne times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extremely important sta=\r\ntement to answer our queries.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Important information about Vimalanand=\r\na which I came to know only yesterday is that he was a big time smoker and =\r\nthere was not a single day passed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking exc=\r\nept on the final day of his departure from physical body. He used to as wel=\r\nl `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently and occasionally\n ate meat. I gave this informa=\r\ntion, because as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an interesti=\r\nng coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please also n=\r\note an important thing. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all his a=\r\nudience to do what he says and not try to do what he does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now whate=\r\nver I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Let m=\r\ne put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unrealized=\r\n person and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take example cases o=\r\nf Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowledg=\r\ned spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are all realized souls who=\r\n achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are knower of ever=\r\nything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly an=\r\nd completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* what they are doi=\r\nng. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;.\n Relevant to our topic of discussion, I wo=\r\nuld say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed anim=\r\nals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a specif=\r\nic purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I said, they k=\r\nnow complete background behind their each action and moreover their self id=\r\nentification is missing from the action and hence it is like Nature operate=\r\ns through them to accomplish a special purpose without binding them in any =\r\ncause-effect chain.&lt;br&gt;Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his discip=\r\nles that Naren is very different from others. He has a blazing spiritual fi=\r\nre burning within him which can consume anything and everything. A food res=\r\ntriction does not bind him. He can eat anything without getting spiritually=\r\n troubled but for others, a kind of food intake is extremely important.&lt;br&gt;=\r\nIf Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some sub=\r\ntle purpose which is not\n possible for majority of us to comprehend unless =\r\nexplained by a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from the =\r\nsincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as on=\r\ne of them and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and =\r\nsuch other undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that he=\r\n is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he a=\r\nte. It is also possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings on=\r\n the animal&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no =\r\napparent reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not=\r\n know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Viveka=\r\nnanda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in Indi=\r\na and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some years act=\r\nually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him to st=\r\nay away from water\n and when he requested swami to accept him as his discip=\r\nle, swami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and his=\r\n guru will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man late=\r\nr became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actual=\r\nly given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled what s=\r\nwami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Swami Vivekananda was all k=\r\nnowing and most of us are NOT.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So moral of my whole writings is that=\r\n it&#39;s unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional=\r\n habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Mahara=\r\nj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our completel=\r\ny self identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best Reg=\r\nards,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utpal &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;\n hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://us.mc504.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogr=\r\noups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@\n yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@..=\r\n. &gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Utpal Ji,&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=C3=82&nbsp;I was about=\r\n to ask this question today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=82&nbsp; It is clear from=\r\n the below passage meat eating is not advisable for anyone.=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; I was=C3=82&nbsp;reading a book on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha =\r\n- in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he survived many days on just eating me=\r\nat when he was living in USA also relished it.

Do they ever think of the agony a hen goes=\r\n through when her chicks are slain in front of her eyes? or a cow, the embo=\r\ndiment of motherliness, do they consider how much she suffers when she sees=\r\n the slaughter of her beloved calf whom she has grown in her own body and n=\r\nourished with her milk, whom she loves more than her own life?&lt;br&gt;&gt; Do t=\r\nhese so called humans ever think of the terrible pain they cause to mother =\r\ncow? Could they endure their own children being murdered before their own e=\r\nyes?&lt;br&gt;&gt; How is Ma to teach such donkeys? They are not humans, whose in=\r\ntellect is subtle enough to self-identify\n with another being of a differen=\r\nt species and experience its personal joys and sorrows. Ma has no alternati=\r\nve but to make them suffer, allowing the animals they have tortured to tort=\r\nure them in return. Fair&#39;s fair, after all.
