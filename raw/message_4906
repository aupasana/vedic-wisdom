There are many ways to god. But fire is very useful and fast. Even lighting a fire, imagining god in the fire and just meditating in front of the fire with a mantra is good enough.\n \nMany people in this situation try the super-short procedure (see the appendices at the end of the manual). It is much simpler and has very few mantras and much simpler ones. A lot of people find it easy to start with super-short procedure and slowly expand it. You may want to take a look.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Karan &lt;meeshusunita@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Narsimhaji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Read through the Ganapathi Homam manual and it seems to be little difficult for me to do the whole process without errors.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have played the video done by you several times and I enjoy listening to it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can&#39;t I just listen to the video of homam manual and just try to meditate  on lord Ganesha and just do simple steps like offering food, dhoop, camphor etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Can&#39;t I offer grains ( as mentioned in homam manual, each time we say &quot;Swaha&quot; ) at lotus feet of Ganesha instead of  fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; Obviously I am asking these questions because I need some help ( materialistic along with spiritual goal).\n&gt; \n&gt; Please guide me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sunita\n\n\n"}}
