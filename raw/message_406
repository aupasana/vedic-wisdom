Its tools (as =\r\nopposed to weapons) are surrender and devotion.\n \nWhen a person of sattwa r=\r\neaches great spiritual heights and is beyond even surrender and devotion, t=\r\nhen a question of a weapon to defeat taamasic influence may arise. Please r=\r\nemember that Pratyangira was used to remove the agitation in a person no le=\r\nss than Lord Narasimha.\n \nThe weapon is made difficult to use because more =\r\nand more people unaware of what the weapon is for would start using it in t=\r\nhis age for all kind of silly purposes.\n \nIf a black magician troubles one,=\r\n it is like the school bully troubling one in my allegory. As I said, locki=\r\nng mechanism on your mother&#39;s automatic gun that prevents you from using th=\r\ne weapon does not prevent you from fighting the bully by reporting to your =\r\nmother. You can fight black magic through surrender and devotion to god. In=\r\n fact, that is the best way to fight. In any case, Pratyangira homam as pra=\r\ncticed by most people today does NOT help you fight black magicians.\n \n*   =\r\n     *        *\n \nBTW, you are incorrectly equating vamachara with kshudra =\r\nactivities like black magic to trouble people. Not all who use vamachara ar=\r\ne alike. Aghoris uses tamasik practices, but to test how saattwik one inter=\r\nnally is and whether external tamasik influences can disturb the internal s=\r\nattwa inside one. An aghori wants to be in such a perfect state of sattwik =\r\nequilibrium of consciousness that he hones his equlibrium by using deprivin=\r\ng external factors to try destabilizing the internal sattwa and eventually =\r\nreaching a state that they have no effect on him.\n \nThus, the use of tamasi=\r\nk practices by an aghori is different from the use of tamasik practices by =\r\nsome black magicians to trouble people. You can&#39;t place all vamamargis in o=\r\nne group.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyot=\r\nish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software=\r\n (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websi=\r\nte: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Hariprasa=\r\nd Nellitheertha \n  To: sohamsa@yahoogroups.com \n  Cc: vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com ; sivacharya@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, September 14, 2008 1:=\r\n01 AM\n  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: [sohamsa] Misconceptions on Pratyangira=\r\n Homam\n\n\n  Dear Narasimhaji, Namaskara, \n\n\n  Thanks for this wonderful post=\r\n and explanation. The analogy really helps understand why this form of wors=\r\nhip is not really appropriate in this Yuga. \n\n\n  At the same time, this rai=\r\nses a question in my mind. While the &quot;weapon&quot; has been locked and the &quot;qual=\r\nification&quot; for practicing Pratyangira Homam has been made more &quot;rigid&quot;, the=\r\n same does not seem to be the case with those who practice Tamasic activiti=\r\nes (Vaamachara/Vaamamarga). From what I understand, a lot of people still r=\r\nesort to Vaamamarga and they seem to succeed far more easily than those who=\r\n try to counter them with Pratyangira or other related weapons.\n\n\n  What ar=\r\ne your thoughts on this aspect? Do you think the weapons for tamasic activi=\r\nties are far more easily available and usable because it is the basic natur=\r\ne of Kali Yuga for adharma to increase? \n\n\n  Kindly let us know your though=\r\nts on this.\n\n\n  Thanks and Regards,\n  Hari\n\n\n  On Sun, Sep 14, 2008 at 5:20=\r\n AM, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n\n    Namaste friends,\n\n =\r\n   I recently saw the chart of a person who is in some troubles. He is trou=\r\nbled by some professional rivals. A priest recommended Pratyangira homam an=\r\nd performed it for him. Some people mistakenly believe that Pratyangira hom=\r\nam gives relief from this kind of petty troubles.\n\n    Inspite of the risk =\r\nof offending some elders, I want to put my foot down and assert one thing s=\r\ntrongly and bluntly, for whatever it is worth. More learned ones who disagr=\r\nee with me may kindly forgive me and ignore me.\n\n    *        *        *\n\n =\r\n   Pratyangira is a very very powerful deity and very very few people know =\r\ntoday how to worship her properly. I am talking about all kinds of worship =\r\nhere - worshipping Her in an external fire and worshipping Her in one&#39;s own=\r\n internal fire and Kundalini shakti.\n\n    I do not want to emphasize the ne=\r\ncessity to learn to worship Her properly, because very very few people are =\r\nactually *ready* for worshipping this form today. Many other forms are far =\r\nmore suitable for most people.\n\n    *        *        *\n\n    Pratyangira is=\r\n an astra devata (astra=3Dweapon). A powerful automatic gun may be used to =\r\nshoot a specific object at a large distance when an expert uses it. If one =\r\nis not an expert, the gun may not fire at all or may hit some other object.=\r\n One is better off staying away from the gun in that case.\n\n    I can give =\r\nan allegory for today&#39;s situation w.r.t. Pratyangira.\n\n    One&#39;s Mother had=\r\n a very powerful automatic gun. She was a high official in military and use=\r\nd the gun in some important wars she participated in. Once upon a time, one=\r\n of her sons learnt how to use the gun and knew how to knock down powerful =\r\nenemies in a combat using that gun.\n\n    Many years later, a small young bo=\r\ny of the lady was being troubled by a bully at school. He wanted to solve t=\r\nhe problem. A friend at school, who was known in his circle as a smart pers=\r\non, suggested using his mother&#39;s gun. They messed around with mother&#39;s gun,=\r\n but nothing happened because they did not know how to use it. But that was=\r\n good, because there could have been an accident and one of them could have=\r\n been hurt in the exercise! Luckily, his mother put a locking mechanism on =\r\nthe gun because she had young children at home. Another time, a smart frind=\r\n who knew how to unlock it but not knowing fully how to use the gun, unlock=\r\ned it and shot it. He ended up unintentionally hurting the young boy.\n\n    =\r\nIn today&#39;s deepening age of Kali, &quot;locking mechanism&quot; is put on astra vidya=\r\ns such as Pratyangira, Bala, Atibala, Mahabala, Paashupata etc. Going back =\r\nto my allegory, because the home (world of sadhana) now includes a lot of y=\r\noung boys (most of us with half-knowledge and incomplete spiritual maturity=\r\n), mother has placed locking mechanism on dangerous weapons that are risky =\r\nin the hands of young children. She did not want automatic guns, assault ri=\r\nfles, missile launchers etc to be used for getting back at a school bully. =\r\nWhen one is brave enough, decides that one does not fear the possibility of=\r\n death and wants to go and fight the enemies of the nation in a war, then t=\r\nhose big weapons are useful. They are not meant for standing up to a school=\r\n bully.\n\n    If someone helps us unlock the weapons, it is still a bad idea=\r\n to try using them. It is very risky. The best thing a child can do when a =\r\nschool bully is troubling is to tell his mother about it and let her handle=\r\n it. Taking mother&#39;s weapons and trying to handle it oneself is a very bad =\r\nidea.\n\n    Simialrly, performing Pratyangira homam to overcome the obstacle=\r\ns caused by an enemy or a rival or take care of some such material troubles=\r\n is unwise and risky. When one is very pure and saattwik and battle with a =\r\ntamasik force has agitated a highly pure one, she is to be used as a weapon=\r\n to bring down that agitation and restore sattwa. Her purpose is a really h=\r\nigh one and inapplicable to most people.\n\n    *        *        *\n\n    Some=\r\n temples perform Pratyangira homam regularly. I see it as an obedient son t=\r\naking the automatic gun of his mother, dusting it off, cleaning it, lubrica=\r\nting it and putting back where it belongs. The son may do this service on a=\r\n regular basis, without expecting any result and out of love for mother. Th=\r\nat is fine.\n\n    The problem comes only when a son tries to use the weapon =\r\nagainst his enemies or rivals.\n\n    *        *        *\n\n    If you look at=\r\n Pratyangira&#39;s story, she came into being to pacify Lord Narasimha, who dra=\r\nnk the blood of the demon he killed. The guna caused in him by the demon&#39;s =\r\nblood created big problems for the universe and Pratyangira pacified Lord N=\r\narasimha and filled him with pure sattwa again.\n\n    If a goddess could pac=\r\nify a deeply agitated and angry incarnation of Narayana himself and restore=\r\n sattwa in him, you can imagine what that goddess must be like. She is the =\r\nultimate power to restore saattwa and remove all kind of disturbance from o=\r\nne&#39;s consciousness. Such a high deity of purity, equanimity and sattwa rest=\r\noration has been converted to one who ruins one&#39;s enemies and rivals and gi=\r\nves material success and several people perform Pratyangira homam with drie=\r\nd red chillies etc for petty purposes.\n\n    Just as a young boy is better o=\r\nff approaching one&#39;s mother when harassed by a school bully instead of tryi=\r\nng to use his mother&#39;s machine gun, we are better off approaching the Mothe=\r\nr and asking for help rather than trying to use Pratyangira shakti. Chandi =\r\nhomam, saptashati chanting, lalita sahasra nama chanting etc can be used in=\r\nstead of Pratyangira vidya. Surrender to the Mother and chant her prayers, =\r\ninstead of trying to use her sophisticated astra shakti directly.\n\n    Next=\r\n time somebody suggests a Pratyangira homam for material problems, please t=\r\nhink of what I wrote.\n\n    As I have already said, more learned ones who di=\r\nsagree with me may kindly forgive me and ignore me.\n\n    Best regards,\n    =\r\nNarasimha\n    -------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n    Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n =\r\n   Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n    S=\r\npirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Free Jyotish le=\r\nssons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n    Free Jyotish software (=\r\nWindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n    Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n    -------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------- \n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_01FD_01C91683.2A7F1C30\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;#ygrp-mkp {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PAD=\r\nDING-RIGHT: 14px; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 14px; PADDIN=\r\nG-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 14px 0px; BORDER-LEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-TO=\r\nP: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\n}\n#ygrp-mkp HR=\r\n {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-=\r\nLEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {=\r\n\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 85%; MARGIN: 10px 0px; COLOR: #628c2a; LINE=\r\n-HEIGHT: 122%\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n\tMARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\n\tPA=\r\nDDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px\n=\r\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad A {\n\tCOLOR: #0000ff; TEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;MET=\r\nA content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3395&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=\r\n=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;Path of sattwa does not need a weapon in general. \nIts tools (as oppos=\r\ned to weapons) are surrender and devotion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DA=\r\nrial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;When a p=\r\nerson of sattwa reaches great spiritual \nheights and is beyond even surrend=\r\ner and devotion, then a question of a weapon \nto defeat taamasic influence&=\r\nnbsp;may arise.
