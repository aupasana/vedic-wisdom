You are lucky to have spent time with Manish in the blessed city of K=\r\nashi and that too at the blessed Manikarnika ghat.\n=C2=A0\nThere is somethin=\r\ng about Manish and dogs. Even when we two were doing a Chandi homam atop a =\r\nhill in Kurukshetra in May 2008, a similar thing happened. A pack of 7-8 do=\r\ngs living on that hill came and sat around the homam to watch. They were ca=\r\nlm for the entire homam (a couple of hours) and watched it. When bali (we u=\r\nsed raisins, i.e. kismis) was offered at the end, they all got up together =\r\nand ran in one direction barking and jumping up. It was as though they were=\r\n trying to chase someone.\n=C2=A0\nSome say that several animals, especially =\r\ndogs, have subtle extra-sensory perception that is superior to that of huma=\r\nns.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThat homam is still fresh in my mind. Whe=\r\nn we were climbing that hill in the afternoon to do some shooting, Manish t=\r\nold me, &quot;we have a strong connection with this place. Something will happen=\r\n here today.&quot; When we discovered two Nath path sadhus following Gorakhnath =\r\n(Gorakshanath) living there, we talked to them for a while. Manish saw thei=\r\nr homa kundam there and asked, &quot;we do a Chandi homam everyday. Can we do it=\r\n in your homa kundam tonight?&quot; The person said, &quot;we are worshippers of Nara=\r\nyana and do not want any taamasik deities to be called or any taamasik prac=\r\ntices resorted to.&quot; We told him we would call Mahalakshmi in fire and there=\r\n would be no taamasik practices. Then he consented.\n=C2=A0\nWe left and reac=\r\nhed the hill with materials around 8:30 pm. The hill and its surroundings w=\r\nere pitch dark and silent. There was no electricity in that area. We climbe=\r\nd the hill using Manish&#39;s cell phone backlight to show the way. There were =\r\nseveral dogs there and they started barking when they saw us climbing. But =\r\nwhen we started the homam, dogs stopped barking and sat around the fire cal=\r\nmly. An old sadhu also came out of the hut and sat near the fire.\n=C2=A0\nTh=\r\ne moment The Mother was invoked in fire, the whole place that was silent ti=\r\nll then except for our chants suddenly came alive with all kinds of sounds.=\r\n There was a valley in the eastern direction. A lot of birds suddenly rose =\r\nup from their trees in that area and started making loud sounds. The whole =\r\narea resounded with the sounds of birds, beetles etc. Given the silence til=\r\nl then, this huge commotion felt quite eerie.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nWhile on the topic of that trip, I can mention something personal that demo=\r\nnstrates how pride keeps coming back, as taught by Ramakrishna in the story=\r\n sent by Prasanth today.\n=C2=A0\nDuring that trip in the Indian summer of 20=\r\n08, Manish kept on feeding my ego. He praised me to the skies in front of s=\r\neveral people. When a lady saint in the lineage of Upasani Maharaj was talk=\r\ning about Upasani Maharaj, Manish would bring me into the topic and mention=\r\n great things about me. As he kept praising me in front of people, I was fi=\r\nrst unaffected. But it slowly got to my head. I started to feel special.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nOn the night of that homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra, Manish relaxe=\r\nd his rule of not allowing another person to put aahutis in fire when doing=\r\n homam. Though the plan was that I would do homam in my homa kundam and Man=\r\nish would do in their homa kundam, he changed his mind at the last minute a=\r\nnd said we would do together in the same homa kundam. He said I was ready a=\r\nnd could share homam with him. I was ecstatic and saw it as an &quot;acknowledgm=\r\nent&quot; of my &quot;spiritual progress&quot;. My already provoked pride peaked with this=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\nMy mind was filled with proud thoughts and my focus on mantra and =\r\ndeity was weak, as we chanted Saptashati during that night&#39;s homam. Manish =\r\nsaid nothing there. The moment homam was over and we went back, he scolded =\r\nme with a very stern and serious tone, &quot;what were you thinking? We called t=\r\nhe Mother in fire and you were so distracted. You wasted a great opportunit=\r\ny tonight. We are chootiyas (an expletive) and She is the Mother of the uni=\r\nverse. How can you absorb your mind in egoistic thoughts in her presence? H=\r\nad I been strict like my gurus or like the gurus of the old times, you woul=\r\nd&#39;ve been killed today.&quot; He was in that serious mood for an hour or so and =\r\nthen became very kind and compassionate again. He laughed, &quot;are you still t=\r\nhinking about it? Leave it Narasimha. These things happen. Everything happe=\r\nns for good. I have no doubt you will overcome. Time has to come for anythi=\r\nng. Don&#39;t worry and keep doing sadhana.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nI realized that day that Ma=\r\nhaamaayaa is very powerful. Irrespective of what you experience and irrespe=\r\nctive of how much progress you make, she can delude you in a split second. =\r\nIn fact, the experiences one has and the progress one makes is not really o=\r\nne&#39;s. She gives them and she uses them to bind one. The moment one thinks &quot;=\r\nI, so-and-so individual, exist&quot; and attributes those &quot;experiences&quot; and &quot;pro=\r\ngress&quot; to that &quot;I&quot;, one is instantly bound - there is scope for pride, happ=\r\niness, unhappiness etc and one can be deluded. Constant surrender to the su=\r\npreme power running the universe, while performing the duties that one is i=\r\nnspired to perform using the body inhabited by one and without paying ANY a=\r\nttention to ANY results that come, including praises and criticism, is the =\r\nonly solution.\n=C2=A0\nThis experience taught me a very valuable lesson. Wha=\r\nt Manish said about me to others in my presence may have been a way of test=\r\ning me. It is also possible that it is correct. In either case, it does not=\r\n matter. The persona (body-name-entity) one inhabits on earth is a *tempora=\r\nry* abode allocated to one for fulfilling one&#39;s dharma. Attributes of that =\r\npersona, including its merits and demerits, are irrelevant to one. The mome=\r\nnt one looks at that persona as &quot;I&quot; and forms an attachment to the attribut=\r\nes of that persona, one gets bound. Instead, one should just use that perso=\r\nna to fulfill dharma without forming an attachment. An attachment to a pers=\r\nona brings many happinesses and many miseries and binds one, irrespective o=\r\nf how meritorious that persona is. At the end of the day, everything that i=\r\ns temporary perishes.\n=C2=A0\nAlso, note that pride can strike anytime anywh=\r\nere, as long as one has an attachment to the persona. Keep doing sadhana, w=\r\nhile constantly contemplating and guarding against such an attachment. Prid=\r\ne is suppressed for a while, comes back again, is suppressed again, comes b=\r\nack again and so on. This cycle goes on until one&#39;s attachment to the perso=\r\nna is killed completely. This is a long process. Don&#39;t worry too much and j=\r\nust keep doing sadhana.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThe thing about the hu=\r\nngry kid reminds me of something. When Manish and I were climbing down at G=\r\nirnar around sunset, a lame dog that was walking on 3 legs started followin=\r\ng us. It came with us a long way. At one point, it ran ahead of us and sat =\r\nin front of a roadside (or rather stair-side) stall that was still open. Ma=\r\nnish stopped there, bought some biscuit packets and fed some to the dog. Th=\r\nat dog stopped following us then. In a couple of minutes, we encountered an=\r\n old man in shoddy clothes. He was weeping. Manish stopped and asked him wh=\r\nat happened. He said he lost all his money at a hotel in Junagadh and has n=\r\no money to even buy food. He decided to just climb the hill (it has 7,000 s=\r\ntairs!) and go to Dattatreya and leave it to him to help him out. He was cl=\r\nimbing up, while we were climbing down. It was getting nearly dark then. Ma=\r\nnish gave him a lot of money, all the biscuit packets that were with us and=\r\n a soft drink. He thanked and gave back a few\n biscuit pieces to me and sai=\r\nd, &quot;you guys keep this.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nLater Manish told me the same thing he told=\r\n you, &quot;you never know when and in what form god comes to test you. Kindness=\r\n and compassion towards needy people is an important dharma.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nOne do=\r\nes not need to do something beyond one&#39;s means. But, one can have compassio=\r\nn, feel the other person&#39;s pain and help within one&#39;s means.\n=C2=A0\nI consi=\r\ndered the biscuit pieces given back by that old man as Dattatreya&#39;s prasad =\r\nand ate it. Regarding the child you saw, please note that Vatuka Bhairava i=\r\ns depicted as a child.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nBTW, the Girnar trip ha=\r\nppenened unplanned. We were supposed to be in Dwaraka for one more day shoo=\r\nting for the Krishna movie. But we basically finished what we had intended.=\r\n So I was thinking in my mind with dissatisfaction, &quot;why does Manish want t=\r\no prolong things here and shoot more? We are done here. Why can&#39;t we just l=\r\neave Dwaraka and perhaps go to Girnar for a day?&quot; I kept my thoughts to mys=\r\nelf. It was late in the evening and we were on our way to a Shiva temple at=\r\n Dwaraka. All of a sudden, Manish told the driver to stop and turn back to =\r\nthe hotel. He announced that we were leaving for Girnar. He said, &quot;bulawa a=\r\na gaya. hum Girnar jaayenge&quot; (invitation has arrived. We will go to Girnar.=\r\n) We rushed to the hotel, packed and left in 10 minutes. We reached Girnar =\r\naround midnight and spent the next day there. For those who do not know, Gi=\r\nrnar is considered the abode of Lord Dattatreya.\n=C2=A0\nSometimes, Manish h=\r\nas the uncanny ability to respond to one&#39;s thoughts. However, he says it is=\r\n not his ability, but it is Nature listening to one&#39;s wish and fulfilling t=\r\nhrough another.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nImagine chess pieces being mo=\r\nved by an expert player thinking &quot;I am an powerful king. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am=\r\n a beautiful queen. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am a strong knight. I am great&quot;, &quot;I kil=\r\nled a great bishop despite being a pawn. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am just a pawn, bu=\r\nt I sacrificed myself to trap the queen. I am great&quot; etc.\n=C2=A0\nIt may sou=\r\nnd weird, but this is what happens in real life all the time. You, I, all t=\r\nhese people are pieces in another kind of chess game. Not realizing that a =\r\nplayer is moving us, we engage in egoistic thoughts, fake happiness, fake s=\r\nadness, fake pride, fake shame etc. One is free from all those fake feeling=\r\ns if one realizes this. Of course, that does not mean inaction. The inspira=\r\ntion that comes in us to engage in various actions in the world is like the=\r\n hand of the player moving the piece. We should respect that engage in acti=\r\nons, but not see them as our actions.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=C2=A0=\r\n Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Your=\r\nself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films th=\r\nat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish =\r\nwritings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=C2=A0\n--- On Th=\r\nu, 1/14/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: rajarshi=\r\n nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Rama Naama Satya H=\r\nai - 1\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\nDate: Thursday, January 14, 2010,=\r\n 6:56 AM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear Narasimha and others,\n=C2=A0\nRajarshi, I hope=\r\n you had a nice stay at Varanasi with Manish. I see that your signature cha=\r\nnged after the trip.\n=C2=A0\nWe had a remarkable time at Varanasi. \n=C2=A0\nT=\r\nhe moment our flight landed at the Kashi airport which is actually quite ou=\r\ntside the main city of Kashi, Manish said there is something in here which =\r\nis different. The energy is palpable throughout. After checking in at the h=\r\notel we spend the time in roaming around the ghats, watching the evening Ga=\r\nnga Arati and shooting.\n=C2=A0\nBy 9 PM Manish decided on doing a Chandi hom=\r\na, at the famous Manikarnika samshan, on a funeral pyre. Sadhana in a samsh=\r\nan bhoomi is something that many great sadhakas in Hinduism have done befor=\r\ne. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to perform various sadhanas in a samshan.Sr=\r\ni Trilanga Swami - a great siddha -=C2=A0spent most of his days near the Ma=\r\nnikarnik Samshan doing sadhana.=C2=A0The effect that a Samshan has on the h=\r\numan consciousness can be apty used, for those who have such inclination, t=\r\no further ones spiritual growth. The fire of a funeral pyre is called kravy=\r\nada agni, an impure form of fire unlike the fire of a standard homa agni. H=\r\nowever, there have been sadhakas, and many in number, who has used the sams=\r\nhan agni to perform homas. They chose not to make a distinction between pur=\r\ne and impure.If someone feels that a funeral pyre is &quot;unholy&quot;, he or she wo=\r\nuld be better off not trying anything in such a fire. The main deities of a=\r\n samshan bhoomi are Mahakala and\n Mahakali. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0We went to buy so=\r\nme samagri - til (black and white), couple of=C2=A0full coconuts, flowers, =\r\nincense stick (agabatti), =C2=A0kismis, havan samagri. While buying the sam=\r\nagri from a shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath temple, suddenly a small=\r\n begger child came and kept asking for food. There was a sweet shop on the =\r\nother side of the lane, he pointed to the shop asking for food. Manish turn=\r\ned around, bought some food and gave it to the child. The child was eating =\r\nwhen we turned back towards the shop from where we were buying the samagri.=\r\n In a moment Manish asked me to check for the child, I turned round and fou=\r\nnd no one there. I looked in the lane and there was no child anywhere. Just=\r\n gone, vanished! I still remember the child very clearly. Manish smiled and=\r\n said, &quot; The deity of this place wanted to see whether we=C2=A0had become s=\r\no big sadhakas that we=C2=A0are unable to feed a hungry child=C2=A0. That i=\r\ns how God comes to test people.=C2=A0Kya pata Narayan kab, kaha aur=C2=A0ki=\r\ns\n roop me mil jaye.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nAt 11 pm we left for Manikarnik, dressed in a =\r\ncombination of red and black. Walking along the ghats we reached the samsha=\r\nn at around eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, with=C2=A0domes (people wh=\r\no work there to help the bodies burn) and the relatives. There were at leas=\r\nt 8 to 10 pyres burning simultaneously. Right next to it was the Ganges, pi=\r\ntch black at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting for the crowd to ease out a=\r\n bit, not sure when that will happen, not sure=C2=A0how people are going to=\r\n react. As we sat observing, the people too were observing us with a mix of=\r\n curiosity=C2=A0and possible=C2=A0apprehension.=C2=A0Suddenly Manish closed=\r\n his eyes and meditated some time, then remarked that this place has a trem=\r\nendous energy. Something of almost infinite abilities resides in this samsh=\r\nan bhoomi. A deity. While sayingf so he turned behind to look at something,=\r\n I too turned. I could see nothing but blank space. But that very instant t=\r\nhe dogs in the samshan went running=C2=A0to\n that direction.\n=C2=A0\nAfter w=\r\naiting like this for about an hour, we found a pyre where the relatives had=\r\n left.The major portion had been burnt already, but there was enough left t=\r\no last for some time still. We went and sat next to it. Manish started the =\r\nhoma. The offering was of til. I sat next to him doing the Chandi path, try=\r\ning to be in sync with his recital. A part of my mind was also trying to ad=\r\njust itself to the ambience. There were quite a few people around watching =\r\nwhat we were upto. But no one disturbed. The dome had to come and take wood=\r\n from the pyre to light other pyres. He did it in the most cautious manner =\r\npossible, taking pieces from the fringe of the pyre. After some time Manish=\r\n indicated to him not to take any more wood. The dome nodded his head and d=\r\nid not disturb that pyre again. \n=C2=A0\nVery soon, within half an hour I no=\r\nticed that a pack of 4/5 dogs had come and were sitting around the pyre on =\r\nwhich the homa was being done. As=C2=A0I=C2=A0read the Chandi I felt a grea=\r\nt pressure on my head, from all sides. As if a something was pressing hard =\r\non my skull, gripping it tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon =\r\nforgot who was watching us or anything else around me, except for the sound=\r\n of the Chandi Path. Very nice meditation happened.

For I think about 10 mins it kept sta=\r\nring with it&#39;s head pointed in an angular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism g=\r\nave a feeling as if it is not an animal but a human being\n watching. Just s=\r\ntaring and observing every action. Manish said Kala Bhairava had entered in=\r\nto the body of that dog.\n=C2=A0\nThe homa finished at around 3 AM. The medit=\r\nations both at the end as well as in between, were all excellent. The mind =\r\nwould just get pulled a few notches above the ordinary with slightest bit o=\r\nf effort.\n=C2=A0\nSimply being in a samshan and observing the human body bur=\r\nning up has a powerful effect on the mind. In a nearby pyre we saw the femu=\r\nr bones of a female human body burning. Both the femurs were visible and sp=\r\nread apart. In an ordinary setting, this kind of a scene would mean a woman=\r\n with &quot;legs spread apart&quot; which has a very sexual connotation. In Manikarni=\r\nk, on that night, it only evoked a feeling of how eventually the body is me=\r\nrely a covering for something far more real and powerful that resides insid=\r\ne. The skin, flesh, bones etc will perish as they are ment to perish. Only =\r\nRama naam satya hai.\n=C2=A0\nManish said if your intentions of going to a sa=\r\nmshan bhoomi is merely to please God through sadhanas=C2=A0- i.e you are no=\r\nt planning something negative nor desirous of petty mundane gains - there i=\r\ns very little chance that you will ever come to harm. Further, when you do =\r\na Chandi homa, no ethereal beings will disturb you because no one wants to =\r\nmess with=C2=A0someone who is worshipping Chandi.

You are lucky to have spent time with Manish in t=\r\nhe blessed city of Kashi and that too at the blessed Manikarnika ghat.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;There is something about Manish and dogs. Even when we two were do=\r\ning a Chandi homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra in May 2008, a similar thing =\r\nhappened. A pack of 7-8 dogs living on that hill came and sat around the ho=\r\nmam to watch. They were calm for the entire homam (a couple of hours) and w=\r\natched it. When bali (we used raisins, i.e. kismis) was offered at the end,=\r\n they all got up together and ran in one direction barking and jumping up. =\r\nIt was as though they were trying to chase someone.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Some say t=\r\nhat several animals, especially dogs, have subtle extra-sensory perception =\r\nthat is superior to that of humans.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;That homam is\n still fresh in my mind. When we were climbing that hill in=\r\n the afternoon to do some shooting, Manish told me, &quot;we have a strong conne=\r\nction with this place. Something will happen here today.&quot; When we discovere=\r\nd two Nath path sadhus following Gorakhnath (Gorakshanath) living there, we=\r\n talked to them for a while. Manish saw their homa kundam there and asked, =\r\n&quot;we do a Chandi homam everyday. Can we do it in your homa kundam tonight?&quot; =\r\nThe person said, &quot;we are worshippers of Narayana and do not want any taamas=\r\nik deities to be called or any taamasik practices resorted to.&quot; We told him=\r\n we would call Mahalakshmi in fire and there would be no taamasik practices=\r\n. Then he consented.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;We left and reached the hill with materia=\r\nls around 8:30 pm. The hill and its surroundings were pitch dark and silent=\r\n. There was no electricity in that area. We climbed the hill using Manish&#39;s=\r\n cell phone backlight to show the way. There were several dogs there and th=\r\ney\n started barking when they saw us climbing. But when we started the homa=\r\nm, dogs stopped barking and sat around the fire calmly. An old sadhu also c=\r\name out of the hut and sat near the fire.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The moment The Mothe=\r\nr was invoked in fire, the whole place that was silent till then except for=\r\n our chants suddenly came alive with all kinds of sounds. There was a valle=\r\ny in the eastern direction. A lot of birds suddenly rose up from their tree=\r\ns in that area and started making loud sounds. The whole area resounded wit=\r\nh the sounds of birds, beetles etc. Given the silence till then, this huge =\r\ncommotion felt quite eerie.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;While =\r\non the topic of that trip, I can mention something personal that demonstrat=\r\nes how pride keeps coming back, as taught by Ramakrishna in the story sent =\r\nby Prasanth today.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;During that trip in the Indian summer\n of 2=\r\n008, Manish kept on feeding my ego. He praised me to the skies in front of =\r\nseveral people. When a lady saint in the lineage of Upasani Maharaj was tal=\r\nking about Upasani Maharaj, Manish would bring me into the topic and mentio=\r\nn great things about me. As he kept praising me in front of people, I was f=\r\nirst unaffected. But it slowly got to my head. I started to feel special.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;On the night of that homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra, Manish r=\r\nelaxed his rule of not allowing another person to put aahutis in fire when =\r\ndoing homam. Though the plan was that I would do homam in my homa kundam an=\r\nd Manish would do in their homa kundam, he changed his mind at the last min=\r\nute and said we would do together in the same homa kundam. He said I was re=\r\nady and could share homam with him. I was ecstatic and saw it as an &quot;acknow=\r\nledgment&quot; of my &quot;spiritual progress&quot;. My already provoked pride peaked with=\r\n this.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;My mind was filled with proud thoughts and\n my focus on=\r\n mantra and deity was weak, as we chanted Saptashati during that night&#39;s ho=\r\nmam. Manish said nothing there. The moment homam was over and we went back,=\r\n he scolded me with a very stern and serious tone, &quot;what were you thinking?=\r\n We called the Mother in fire and you were so distracted. You wasted a grea=\r\nt opportunity tonight. We are chootiyas (an expletive) and She is the Mothe=\r\nr of the universe. How can you absorb your mind in egoistic thoughts in her=\r\n presence? Had I been strict like my gurus or like the gurus of the old tim=\r\nes, you would&#39;ve been killed today.&quot; He was in that serious mood for an hou=\r\nr or so and then became very kind and compassionate again. He laughed, &quot;are=\r\n you still thinking about it? Leave it Narasimha. These things happen. Ever=\r\nything happens for good. I have no doubt you will overcome. Time has to com=\r\ne for anything. Don&#39;t worry and keep doing sadhana.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;I realize=\r\nd that day that Mahaamaayaa is very powerful.\n Irrespective of what you exp=\r\nerience and irrespective of how much progress you make, she can delude you =\r\nin a split second. In fact, the experiences one has and the progress one ma=\r\nkes is not really one&#39;s. She gives them and she uses them to bind one. The =\r\nmoment one thinks &quot;I, so-and-so individual, exist&quot; and attributes those &quot;ex=\r\nperiences&quot; and &quot;progress&quot; to that &quot;I&quot;, one is instantly bound - there is sc=\r\nope for pride, happiness, unhappiness etc and one can be deluded. Constant =\r\nsurrender to the supreme power running the universe, while performing the d=\r\nuties that one is inspired to perform using the body inhabited by one and w=\r\nithout paying ANY attention to ANY results that come, including praises and=\r\n criticism, is the only solution.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;This experience taught me a =\r\nvery valuable lesson. What Manish said about me to others in my presence ma=\r\ny have been a way of testing me. It is also possible that it is correct. In=\r\n either case, it does not matter. The\n persona (body-name-entity) one inhab=\r\nits on earth is a *temporary* abode allocated to one for fulfilling one&#39;s d=\r\nharma. Attributes of that persona, including its merits and demerits, are i=\r\nrrelevant to one. The moment one looks at that persona as &quot;I&quot; and forms an =\r\nattachment to the attributes of that persona, one gets bound. Instead, one =\r\nshould just use that persona to fulfill dharma without forming an attachmen=\r\nt. An attachment to a persona brings many happinesses and many miseries and=\r\n binds one, irrespective of how meritorious that persona is. At the end of =\r\nthe day, everything that is temporary perishes.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Also, note tha=\r\nt pride can strike anytime anywhere, as long as one has an attachment to th=\r\ne persona. Keep doing sadhana, while constantly contemplating and guarding =\r\nagainst such an attachment. Pride is suppressed for a while, comes back aga=\r\nin, is suppressed again, comes back again and so on. This cycle goes on unt=\r\nil one&#39;s attachment to the\n persona is killed completely. This is a long pr=\r\nocess. Don&#39;t worry too much and just keep doing sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The thing about the hungry kid reminds me of somethi=\r\nng. When Manish and I were climbing down at Girnar around sunset, a lame do=\r\ng that was walking on 3 legs started following us. It came with us a long w=\r\nay. At one point, it ran ahead of us and sat in front of a roadside (or rat=\r\nher stair-side) stall that was still open. Manish stopped there, bought som=\r\ne biscuit packets and fed some to the dog. That dog stopped following us th=\r\nen. In a couple of minutes, we encountered an old man in shoddy clothes. He=\r\n was weeping. Manish stopped and asked him what happened. He said he lost a=\r\nll his money at a hotel in Junagadh and has no money to even buy food. He d=\r\necided to just climb the hill (it has 7,000 stairs!) and go to Dattatreya a=\r\nnd leave it to him\n to help him out. He was climbing up, while we were clim=\r\nbing down. It was getting nearly dark then. Manish gave him a lot of money,=\r\n all the biscuit packets that were with us and a soft drink. He thanked and=\r\n gave back a few biscuit pieces to me and said, &quot;you guys keep this.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Later Manish told me the same thing he told you, &quot;you never know wh=\r\nen and in what form god comes to test you. Kindness and compassion towards =\r\nneedy people is an important dharma.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;One does not need to do =\r\nsomething beyond one&#39;s means. But, one can have compassion, feel the other =\r\nperson&#39;s pain and help within one&#39;s means.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;I considered the bi=\r\nscuit pieces given back by that old man as Dattatreya&#39;s prasad and ate it. =\r\nRegarding the child you saw, please note that Vatuka Bhairava is depicted a=\r\ns a child.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;BTW, the Girnar trip ha=\r\nppenened\n unplanned. We were supposed to be in Dwaraka for one more day sho=\r\noting for the Krishna movie. But we basically finished what we had intended=\r\n. So I was thinking in my mind with dissatisfaction, &quot;why does Manish want =\r\nto prolong things here and shoot more? We are done here. Why can&#39;t we just =\r\nleave Dwaraka and perhaps go to Girnar for a day?&quot; I kept my thoughts to my=\r\nself. It was late in the evening and we were on our way to a Shiva temple a=\r\nt Dwaraka. All of a sudden, Manish told the driver to stop and turn back to=\r\n the hotel. He announced that we were leaving for Girnar. He said, &quot;bulawa =\r\naa gaya. hum Girnar jaayenge&quot; (invitation has arrived. We will go to Girnar=\r\n.) We rushed to the hotel, packed and left in 10 minutes. We reached Girnar=\r\n around midnight and spent the next day there. For those who do not know, G=\r\nirnar is considered the abode of Lord Dattatreya.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Sometimes, M=\r\nanish has the uncanny ability to respond to one&#39;s thoughts. However, he say=\r\ns\n it is not his ability, but it is Nature listening to one&#39;s wish and fulf=\r\nilling through another.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Imagine ch=\r\ness pieces being moved by an expert player thinking &quot;I am an powerful king.=\r\n I am great&quot;, &quot;I am a beautiful queen. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am a strong knight. =\r\nI am great&quot;, &quot;I killed a great bishop despite being a pawn. I am great&quot;, &quot;I=\r\n am just a pawn, but I sacrificed myself to trap the queen. I am great&quot; etc=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;It may sound weird, but this is what happens in real life al=\r\nl the time. You, I, all these people are pieces in another kind of chess ga=\r\nme. Not realizing that a player is moving us, we engage in egoistic thought=\r\ns, fake happiness, fake sadness, fake pride, fake shame etc. One is free fr=\r\nom all those fake feelings if one realizes this. Of course, that does not m=\r\nean inaction. The inspiration that comes in us to engage in various\n action=\r\ns in the world is like the hand of the player moving the piece. We should r=\r\nespect that engage in actions, but not see them as our actions.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short =\r\nHomam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a difference: http=\r\n://SaraswatiFil ms.org &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: http://gr=\r\noups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writings: http://gro=\r\nups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Thu, 1/14/=\r\n10, rajarshi nandy &lt;I&gt;&lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt;\n wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nBLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: rajarshi n=\r\nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Rama Naama =\r\nSatya Hai - 1&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Thursday, Janu=\r\nary 14, 2010, 6:56 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1604961683&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n=\r\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D=\r\n0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: inherit; font-size-adjust: inheri=\r\nt; font-stretch: inherit&quot; vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Narasimha and others,&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Rajarshi, I hope you had a nice stay at Varan=\r\nasi with Manish. I see that your signature changed after the trip.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;We had a remarkable time at Varanasi. &lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The moment our flight landed at the Kashi airpo=\r\nrt which is actually quite outside the main city of Kashi, Manish said ther=\r\ne is something in here which is different. The energy is palpable throughou=\r\nt. After checking in at the hotel we spend the time in roaming around the g=\r\nhats, watching the evening Ganga Arati and shooting.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;By 9 PM Manish decided on doing a Chandi homa, at the famous Manikar=\r\nnika samshan, on a funeral pyre. Sadhana in a samshan bhoomi is something t=\r\nhat many great sadhakas in Hinduism have done before. Ramakrishna Paramaham=\r\nsa used to perform various sadhanas in a samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a gre=\r\nat siddha -&nbsp;spent most of his days near the Manikarnik Samshan doing s=\r\nadhana.&nbsp;The effect that a Samshan has on the human consciousness can b=\r\ne apty used, for those who have such inclination, to further ones spiritual=\r\n growth. The fire of a funeral pyre is called kravyada agni, an impure form=\r\n of fire unlike the fire of a standard homa agni. However, there have been =\r\nsadhakas, and many in number, who has used the samshan agni to perform homa=\r\ns. They chose not to make a distinction between pure and impure.If someone =\r\nfeels that a funeral pyre is &quot;unholy&quot;, he or she would be better off not tr=\r\nying anything in such a fire. The main deities of a samshan bhoomi are\n Mah=\r\nakala and Mahakali. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;We went to buy some=\r\n samagri - til (black and white), couple of&nbsp;full coconuts, flowers, in=\r\ncense stick (agabatti), &nbsp;kismis, havan samagri. While buying the samag=\r\nri from a shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath temple, suddenly a small b=\r\negger child came and kept asking for food. There was a sweet shop on the ot=\r\nher side of the lane, he pointed to the shop asking for food. Manish turned=\r\n around, bought some food and gave it to the child. The child was eating wh=\r\nen we turned back towards the shop from where we were buying the samagri. I=\r\nn a moment Manish asked me to check for the child, I turned round and found=\r\n no one there. I looked in the lane and there was no child anywhere. Just g=\r\none, vanished! I still remember the child very clearly. Manish smiled and s=\r\naid, &quot; The deity of this place wanted to see whether we&nbsp;had become so =\r\nbig sadhakas that we&nbsp;are unable to feed a hungry child&nbsp;. That is =\r\nhow God comes to test people.&nbsp;Kya\n pata Narayan kab, kaha aur&nbsp;kis=\r\n roop me mil jaye.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;At 11 pm we left for Manik=\r\narnik, dressed in a combination of red and black. Walking along the ghats w=\r\ne reached the samshan at around eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, with&n=\r\nbsp;domes (people who work there to help the bodies burn) and the relatives=\r\n. There were at least 8 to 10 pyres burning simultaneously. Right next to i=\r\nt was the Ganges, pitch black at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting for the=\r\n crowd to ease out a bit, not sure when that will happen, not sure&nbsp;how=\r\n people are going to react. As we sat observing, the people too were observ=\r\ning us with a mix of curiosity&nbsp;and possible&nbsp;apprehension.&nbsp;Su=\r\nddenly Manish closed his eyes and meditated some time, then remarked that t=\r\nhis place has a tremendous energy. Something of almost infinite abilities r=\r\nesides in this samshan bhoomi. A deity. While sayingf so he turned behind t=\r\no look at something, I too turned. I could see nothing but blank space. But=\r\n that very instant the dogs in the\n samshan went running&nbsp;to that direc=\r\ntion.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;After waiting like this for about an hou=\r\nr, we found a pyre where the relatives had left.The major portion had been =\r\nburnt already, but there was enough left to last for some time still. We we=\r\nnt and sat next to it. Manish started the homa. The offering was of til. I =\r\nsat next to him doing the Chandi path, trying to be in sync with his recita=\r\nl. A part of my mind was also trying to adjust itself to the ambience. Ther=\r\ne were quite a few people around watching what we were upto. But no one dis=\r\nturbed. The dome had to come and take wood from the pyre to light other pyr=\r\nes. He did it in the most cautious manner possible, taking pieces from the =\r\nfringe of the pyre. After some time Manish indicated to him not to take any=\r\n more wood. The dome nodded his head and did not disturb that pyre again. &lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Very soon, within half an hour I noticed that =\r\na pack of 4/5 dogs had come and were sitting around the pyre on which the h=\r\noma was being done. As&nbsp;I&nbsp;read the Chandi I felt a great pressure =\r\non my head, from all sides. As if a something was pressing hard on my skull=\r\n, gripping it tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon forgot who =\r\nwas watching us or anything else around me, except for the sound of the Cha=\r\nndi Path. Very nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it was a =\r\npiece of iron and there&nbsp;was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pu=\r\nlling the mind away to some distant place, far, far away from the reality I=\r\n am normally&nbsp;accustomed to.&nbsp;While the homa was on, suddenly&nbsp;=\r\none black dog from the pack which was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs an=\r\nd kept starting at Manish. For I think about 10 mins it kept staring with i=\r\nt&#39;s head pointed in an angular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeli=\r\nng as if it is\n not an animal but a human being watching. Just staring and =\r\nobserving every action. Manish said Kala Bhairava had entered into the body=\r\n of that dog.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The homa finished at around 3 AM=\r\n. The meditations both at the end as well as in between, were all excellent=\r\n. The mind would just get pulled a few notches above the ordinary with slig=\r\nhtest bit of effort.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Simply being in a samshan=\r\n and observing the human body burning up has a powerful effect on the mind.=\r\n In a nearby pyre we saw the femur bones of a female human body burning. Bo=\r\nth the femurs were visible and spread apart. In an ordinary setting, this k=\r\nind of a scene would mean a woman with &quot;legs spread apart&quot; which has a very=\r\n sexual connotation. In Manikarnik, on that night, it only evoked a feeling=\r\n of how eventually the body is merely a covering for something far more rea=\r\nl and powerful that resides inside. The skin, flesh, bones etc will perish =\r\nas they are ment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Manish said if your intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is mere=\r\nly to please God through sadhanas&nbsp;- i.e you are not planning something=\r\n negative nor desirous of petty mundane gains - there is very little chance=\r\n that you will ever come to harm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa, no et=\r\nhereal beings will disturb you because no one wants to mess with&nbsp;someo=\r\nne who is worshipping Chandi. It is not difficult, neither something to be =\r\nunnecessarily scared of. There are spirits etc for sure, but neither will y=\r\nou bother them nor will they bother you. &nbsp;Surrendering to the deity is=\r\n very good&nbsp;attitude to have. And finally, the soul of the individual o=\r\nn whose pyre the homa is being done, is taken by the Goddess and acquires a=\r\n lot of punya.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thus ended my first experience =\r\nof a Chandi homa on a burning pyre.That night was Krishna Saptami. The next=\r\n two nights again we did homas at Manikarnik. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;...to be c=\r\nontinued...&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D=\r\n&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier c=\r\nolor=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;Rama Naama Satya Hai..&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TAB=\r\nLE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-560478624-1263526883=:55853--\r\n\n"}}
