He said, if what I am saying=\r\n is correct, only human beings \n&gt; will be evolved and other organisms will =\r\nnever attain moksha. I was \n&gt; breathless for a moment and did not know how =\r\nto answer him. I really \n&gt; felt sad (and ashamed, because I thought I could=\r\n answer all questions \n&gt; related to the mystery of life) that I couldnt ans=\r\nwer him. ..snip..\n \nWell, sadhana (effort) is what a being does. Phala (fru=\r\nits) are decided by the Lord. If God wants, a bacteria can get moksha too. =\r\nHowever, *usually* god has some rules of action and reaction to uphold and =\r\nhence does not act out of order. So the chance of a baterium to get moksha =\r\nis negligible (except at the end of this creation cycle).\n \nIt is indeed tr=\r\nue that amoeba or bacteria have very very small chance of moksha in THAT li=\r\nfe. However, nobody stops them from doing some good karma (possibly by *cha=\r\nnce*), get a higher birth and eventually be born as a human and do some sad=\r\nhana.\n \nWhen I wrote &quot;by chance&quot;, it may make some uncomfortable. But that =\r\nis the fact. Whatever action we perform with a sense of *I-ness* behind tha=\r\nt action becomes a karma (action) and an equal and opposite phala (fruit/re=\r\naction) will come. Suppose one donates one&#39;s eyes and feels good about the =\r\nnoble act and the person getting the eyes uses the newly gotten vision to l=\r\nook at some beautiful women, be tempted and rape them, the donor will get p=\r\nart of that karma! The laws of karma are complex. Thinking like &quot;this is a =\r\nnoble karma. So it is good only&quot; is incorrect. Each action results in a ser=\r\nies of developments and begets some karma for the person. Of course, if an =\r\nact is with committed with ego but not an intention to affect a particular =\r\ndevelopment, the part of the karma begotten from that development is smalle=\r\nr (than it would be if that development was intended). Thus, even bacteria =\r\nand amoeba can beget karma from the results of their actions. But it is ver=\r\ny small and accumulates slowly. Highly taamasik beings such as trees, amoeb=\r\na and bacteria take a looooong time to make progress on the ladder of kaarm=\r\nik evolution.\n \nI want to make three comments:\n \n(1) One need not feel sorr=\r\ny for the amoeba and bacteria because they are mostly a long way from moksh=\r\na. Not all beings need to get moksha right away. If that is needed, god did=\r\n not need to create this world. If there is unmanifested Brahman and nothin=\r\ng else in this universe, that will solve all problems. But the fact is that=\r\n manifested Brahman with infinite objects at varying levels of karmic evolu=\r\ntion is not really a problem! That is exactly what is needed for the Lila t=\r\no unfold.\n \n(2) If you want to feel sorry, feel sorry not for amoeba and ba=\r\ncteria, but for those who got the valuable human birth and yet act like amo=\r\neba and bacteria spiritually. Pity those who are stuck in the cycle of happ=\r\niness and sadness, elation and depression, hopes and despairs etc, without =\r\nrealizing that the play will end soon and what birth one will get next is u=\r\nncertain!!\n \n(3) Actually, more than others, feel sorry for yourself. Who a=\r\nre we to worry about others? They, their god and their gurus will feel sorr=\r\ny for them and do something about them. Apne ko kya lena dena? We are first=\r\n responsible for ourselves. When one cannot change self and focus attention=\r\n on god fully within oneself, what is the point in lamenting about the spir=\r\nituality or lack of it in other people? So, we should all try to look inwar=\r\nd and take a critical look at ourselves, given that we got a very very very=\r\n valuable life as a human being.\n \n&gt; His question gave me a sleepless night=\r\n. I thought a lot about it. If \n&gt; the whole world as a maya exist only in h=\r\numan&#39;s mind (as per my \n&gt; understanding, our mind creates this world, when =\r\nthrough yoga, \n&gt; mind/ego collapse happens, there is no world or anything a=\r\nnd we \n&gt; submerge as oneness in the omnipotent power), if it is a creation =\r\nof \n&gt; mind, then there should not be any world when the human species is \n&gt;=\r\n extinct. Right? \n \nA mind is a mind is a mind. Mind creates the world, not=\r\n necessarily a human mind. All minds can create a world. However, a human m=\r\nind is more capable than other minds to break down that created world and r=\r\neturn to the source. THAT is the point.\n \n&gt; (I am asking you because, you w=\r\nere instrumental (though unknowingly) \n&gt; in opening the wide horizon of spi=\r\nritual knowledge to me years back \n&gt; through just one reply to one of my qu=\r\nestions related to Kundalini. I \n&gt; am always indebted to you for that and n=\r\now I realise how stupid my \n&gt; questions were at that time.) \n \nI am glad to=\r\n know that. I am actually a fool who does not know much and cannot help any=\r\none. But the blessings of my gurus may work through me sometimes and benefi=\r\nt some.\n \n&gt; First: \n&gt; I would like to know if you have heard of any vamacha=\r\nris in India who \n&gt; followed Vama Marga successfully and realised God. All =\r\ntrue saints I \n&gt; have heard are followers of the Satwik path/right hand tan=\r\ntra. So \n&gt; always wonder, did any body succeed in the other way? Anybody wh=\r\no was \n&gt; well-known as a Vamamarga saint?\n \nYour question is kind of an oxy=\r\nmoron. Can good aghoris become &quot;well-known&quot; and come to limelight? :-)\n \nI =\r\nknow one masterly aghori reasonably well. However, he is not restricted to =\r\none path. All paths are his own and he does not distinguish. He does aghora=\r\n sadhanas in smashana and also Vedic sadhanas like Vedic homas with the sam=\r\ne attitude. He chants Vedic mantras too. For example, when he chants Sri Ru=\r\ndram, it produces amazing energy all around. He is a bhakti yogi too. When =\r\nhe thinks of Krishna, he melts in devotion. When he discusses upanishads an=\r\nd other Vedanta texts such as Yoga Vaasishtham and BhagavadGita, his keen i=\r\nntellect shines forth like a Sun and illuminates the thinking of a ready au=\r\ndience. I have never seen anyone who has such a perfect understanding of th=\r\ne essence of Upanishads and exudes it in thoughts, words and actions. He ha=\r\ns wife and children, has a full-time job and engages in several external ac=\r\ntivities and is never idle. But his level of detachment with the work he do=\r\nes so expertly is far higher than even ascetics who renounce everything and=\r\n *try* to develop some detachment.\n \nBottomline is that he is an aghori, bu=\r\nt he is also a jnaana yogi, bhakti yogi, karma yogi and raaja yogi. He is a=\r\n vaidika and he is an aghori. All paths are his and he views all the same w=\r\nay. I don&#39;t know if all really good aghoris are like that or just he.\n \nIn =\r\nany case, it is irrelevant to you if any aghori succeeded or not. If YOU ar=\r\ne meant to succeed in aghota, you will. If not, you will not. To be safe, u=\r\nntil the right time and right person comes, one should not venture into agh=\r\nora. I want people to appreciate different things for what they are and not=\r\n have unhealthy biases, but it does not mean everybody should try everythin=\r\ng. Nuclear engineers hating politicians, politicians hating lawyers and law=\r\nyers hating doctors is bad. But one should become what one is supposed to!\n=\r\n \n&gt; A few years back, I had read AGHORA -Kundalini by Robert Svoboda. In \n&gt;=\r\n that book one Aghori Vimalananda is mentioned. But except in that \n&gt; book,=\r\n I couldnt find any references to this person anywhere. Not even \n&gt; in net.=\r\n (The only references were the ones related to Robert \n&gt; Swaboda&#39;s book and=\r\n as his Guru).   \n \nWell, he guarded his privacy and made sure that the boo=\r\nks came out only after he left the body. Moreover, his real name was not th=\r\nat. Also, he led his spiritual life in relative seclusion and not many knew=\r\n him. No wonder you can&#39;t find info on him.\n \nBottomline is: Whether he is =\r\nreal or not, one can benefit from teachings attributed to him. The knowledg=\r\ne present in the aghora series of books is nothing short of amazing. It may=\r\n shock you, but it can change your thinking from inside out and give you a =\r\nclearer understanding. Vimalananda not only managed to impart great underst=\r\nanding to Svoboda, but also ensure that Mother Taaraa Herself would speak t=\r\nhrough Svoboda and the knowledge would come out perfect. Other books author=\r\ned by Svoboda may not have the same brilliance, but those books came out ju=\r\nst as Vimalananda intended.\n \nThere are many things in the book which could=\r\n not have come from a normal person. They came from someone who had a perfe=\r\nct, steady and unwavering understanding of the absolute truth.\n \nBTW, you c=\r\nannot meet a good and genuine aghori unless there is a rina and *he* wants =\r\nyou to meet him.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFr=\r\nee Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC=\r\n) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------ \n \n--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jyothi_b=\r\n_lakshmi&quot; &lt;jyothi_b_lakshmi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasimhji,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Enj=\r\noyed reading both your mails.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr=\r\n@&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; There is one more thing I w=\r\nanted to include in the analogy/parable, \n&gt; but did not do so due to lack o=\r\nf time last night. Let me expand now. \n&gt; Though this is not related to the =\r\noriginal questions, this will \n&gt; complete the story.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *  =\r\n      *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; There was a way to the sea through a country called &quot;Vish=\r\nnu \n&gt; raajyam&quot; [Vaishnavism]. Some people travelled the path, found a \n&gt; be=\r\nautiful city called Vishnupuri on the coast and the sea was close \n&gt; to the=\r\n city. The journey through Vishnu raajya was documented in a \n&gt; book [Vishn=\r\nu Purana] and the book claimed that this was a beautiful \n&gt; journey and ena=\r\nbles one to reach the sea. It also claimed that other \n&gt; coastal cities wer=\r\ne by the very same sea and reaching the sea here \n&gt; amounts to reaching the=\r\n sea at all other places.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; There was another way to the sea throug=\r\nh a country called &quot;Shiva \n&gt; desam&quot; [Shaivism]. Some people travelled the p=\r\nath, found a wonderful \n&gt; city called Shivanagari on the coast and the sea =\r\nwas right next to \n&gt; it. The journey though Shiva desam was documented in a=\r\n book [Shiva \n&gt; Purana] and the book claimed that this was an amazing journ=\r\ney and \n&gt; enables one to reach the sea. It also claimed that other coastal =\r\n\n&gt; cities were by the very same sea and reaching the sea here amounts to \n&gt;=\r\n reaching the sea at all other places.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; There were some people who=\r\n had never actually been to either city \n&gt; nor seen the sea. Some were impr=\r\nessed by the description of one city \n&gt; and some by the other. They were so=\r\n impressed that they started \n&gt; arguing which was the best city. Some even =\r\nwent to the extent of \n&gt; condemning and putting down the other city. Some p=\r\neople who had seen \n&gt; both the cities came forward and said, &quot;the main thin=\r\ng is not the \n&gt; city, but the sea itself. The sea is the same in both place=\r\ns. Though \n&gt; different, both cities are nice and both give one the same sea=\r\n.&quot; That \n&gt; did not convince the fighting factions and they continued to fig=\r\nht. \n&gt; Later, some of them even forgot about the sea and started thinking \n=\r\n&gt; that the city was the main thing and not the sea. Of course, both the \n&gt; =\r\ncities are really beautiful. Stuck in their animosity and fights, \n&gt; they c=\r\nould never visit either city nor enjoy the sea.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *       =\r\n *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; OK, I think the parable is complete now. :-)\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ta=\r\nrpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centr=\r\ne (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------- \n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----=\r\n- \n&gt; &gt;   From: Narasimha P.V.R.

When I was \n&gt; meditating before replying to you, a really beautiful and m=\r\neaningful \n&gt; analogy came to me and I think it is worth sharing with more p=\r\neople \n&gt; than just you.

Ar=\r\ne Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) different from Mantra \n&gt; Shastras\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; (=\r\npeople explain that mantra shastra does not originate from the \n&gt; vedas,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;   &gt; but classified under tantra). Did Mantra shastras not originate \n&gt; fr=\r\nom vedas?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   When people say what is=\r\n in Veda and what is not, honestly I can \n&gt; only laugh. They are only fooli=\r\nng themselves. Reciting Veda with \n&gt; perfect swara or mastering a celebrate=\r\nd commentary does not help one \n&gt; understand Veda. In fact, understanding e=\r\nach single verse in Veda \n&gt; requires great tapascharya. Understanding a ver=\r\nse in Veda is neither \n&gt; possible with energy flowing in Ida nadi (intuitio=\r\nn) nor in Pingala \n&gt; nadi (logic and analysis). It is possible only with en=\r\nergy flowing in \n&gt; Sushumna nadi. It is possible with neither intuition nor=\r\n logic, but \n&gt; only with *revelation* and simply, for the lack of a better =\r\n\n&gt; expression, direct knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   When one meditates long enough =\r\non a verse, the verse may simply \n&gt; be revealed to the yogi. THAT is the on=\r\nly way to understand a Vedic \n&gt; verse. For most people, it is not possible =\r\nto decipher even a single \n&gt; verse in an entire life, let alone a passage.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Bottomoline is: Almost nobody understands Veda today. What are \n=\r\n&gt; considered &quot;pure vaidika rituals&quot; are merely another variety of \n&gt; ritual=\r\ns created by someone at some point of time. From the point of \n&gt; view of au=\r\nthenticity as granted by Veda, there is no difference \n&gt; between them and o=\r\nther aagamic rituals, though people ignorantly \n&gt; believe otherwise.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;   *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   A simple analogy may help clarify a lot=\r\n of things related to this \n&gt; complicated issue a little. What the thing in=\r\n the analogy represents \n&gt; is shown here and there in square brackets [].\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Once there were many people who lived near the sea \n&gt; [Brahman/Aa=\r\ntman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight \n&gt; and sound of =\r\nthe sea [experienced Brahman]. They described the sea in \n&gt; some nice crypt=\r\nic poems [Veda].\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   As people started living a little away from the=\r\n sea [less \n&gt; spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instru=\r\nctions \n&gt; on how to reach the sea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and=\r\n the \n&gt; instructions grew with time. People faithfully followed the \n&gt; inst=\r\nructions [rituals].\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   People started moving further and further in=\r\nland and started \n&gt; living in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. Th=\r\nis generation \n&gt; had never seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a se=\r\na. They \n&gt; faithfully performed the ritual of walking towards east, but did=\r\n not \n&gt; find sea. They debated endlessly whether one had to walk one mile o=\r\nr \n&gt; two miles or three miles and formed different schools of thought. \n&gt; S=\r\nome walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a building or some \n&gt; int=\r\neresting object and even became satisfied that that was sea!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   The=\r\nn came some great person, whose instincts led him to take a \n&gt; horse instea=\r\nd of walking and ride it for a long distance [use of \n&gt; other tools]. He di=\r\nd find the sea after a few months. He put together \n&gt; newer instructions to=\r\n reach the sea, which included riding a horse \n&gt; [new aagamas].\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   =\r\nPeople performing the old rituals objected to this and said &quot;but \n&gt; then th=\r\nis horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a \n&gt; new path and=\r\n different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [&quot;pure&quot; Vedic \n&gt; ritual]. By now, pe=\r\nople did not even understand what the cryptic \n&gt; poems of the original &quot;boo=\r\nk of sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed \n&gt; that those poems taught the old=\r\n &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were \n&gt; used to. They were blissfully unaware=\r\n that the original instructions \n&gt; were meant for someone already close to =\r\nsea and the newer \n&gt; instructions came from someone who actually saw the se=\r\na and knew \n&gt; where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from the=\r\nre!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, chari=\r\nots \n&gt; etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead =\r\n\n&gt; of just instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of \n&gt; mantra/=\r\ntantra/yantras].\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   One particular path through jungles was dangero=\r\nus [aghora and \n&gt; other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat,=\r\n wine etc]. \n&gt; Though the distance to sea was much shorter through that jun=\r\ngle, it \n&gt; was just too dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could =\r\nmake \n&gt; it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in =\r\na \n&gt; risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path \n&gt; =\r\nwere killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory well came \n&gt; forward,=\r\n condemned that path and discouraged people from trying that \n&gt; path. Since=\r\n then, even people who were strong enough to successfully \n&gt; make it in tha=\r\nt path desisted from it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   As time progressed, people started figh=\r\nting too much about whose \n&gt; path was superior. They were foolish, not smar=\r\nt enough to adopt the \n&gt; original instructions, of either the so-called &quot;pu=\r\nre&quot; sea path or the \n&gt; so-called &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for the ch=\r\nanged geography \n&gt; and changed times. Many followed the instructions blindl=\r\ny, hit \n&gt; roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know \n&gt; that =\r\n&quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the actual goal of all their joirneys. \n&gt; They only =\r\nthought they were supposed to follow the instructions \n&gt; faithfully and the=\r\nre was no need to adopt to the changed geographical \n&gt; territory and time. =\r\nThey even condemned those who actually went to \n&gt; sea, came back and gave u=\r\npdated directions for their place and time, \n&gt; for violating tradition.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;   *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   In case the analogy is not clear, he=\r\nre is a brief summary of its \n&gt; points. Veda is about realizing self. Veda =\r\ndescribes various aspects \n&gt; of the state of self-realization. That is why =\r\nit is considered the \n&gt; highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some=\r\n light on possible \n&gt; ways to reach that state. While definitive statements=\r\n can be made on \n&gt; the actual state of self-realization itself, no definiti=\r\nve statements \n&gt; can be made on how to reach it. The path depends on one&#39;s =\r\ncurrent \n&gt; position!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Great men in many spiritual paths, within H=\r\ninduism as well as \n&gt; outside of it, came, experienced that state, understo=\r\nod the current \n&gt; state of people around them and gave specific instruction=\r\ns on how to \n&gt; reach that state from the current state. Some followed the \n=\r\n&gt; instructions and experienced the state. Some instead kept arguing \n&gt; abou=\r\nt the contradictions between paths.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Please re-read the story and=\r\n try to understand what each part of \n&gt; the story represents. If you unders=\r\ntand this analogy well, this can \n&gt; really clarify the meaningless nature o=\r\nf so many debates that people \n&gt; waste time with!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &gt; 2. I read from somewhere that Sri Sri Adi Sankara has co=\r\nndemned\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Tantrik practices. But I also hear and read that he is a gr=\r\neat \n&gt; Sri Vidya\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has its roots from T=\r\nantra, what \n&gt; did\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Sri Adi Sankara condemn? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   He did cond=\r\nemn some vaamaachaara (left-hand) practices of tantra \n&gt; like the use of se=\r\nx, alcohol, meat etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   However, please go back to my analogy. A g=\r\nreat man may condemn \n&gt; the use of a short path to reach the sea if it has =\r\na lot of wild \n&gt; animals and dacoits and many travellers through that path =\r\nrecently \n&gt; lost their lives. It does not mean that path is totally unusabl=\r\ne. It \n&gt; only means that too many people incapable of travelling on that pa=\r\nth \n&gt; are using it of late and so the great man was compelled to stop the \n=\r\n&gt; practice.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   If the same great man is reincarnated at a different=\r\n time when \n&gt; several adept souls he has a rina with are about to be reinca=\r\nrnated, \n&gt; he may not condemn the path and instead write on travelling that=\r\n \n&gt; jungle path carefully!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   The words of great masters need to be=\r\n interpreted within the \n&gt; context of their desa, kaala and paatra and with=\r\nin the context of the \n&gt; purpose of that particular birth.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   *    =\r\n    *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &gt; 3. What is vamachara? if it is the left hand me=\r\nthod - sex, \n&gt; drinks etc,\n&gt; &gt;   &gt; why must it be practiced at all?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;   Suppose one&#39;s house is close to the market and the market noise \n&gt; reac=\r\nhes one&#39;s house. Suppose that noise is disturbing one&#39;s \n&gt; meditation, i.e.=\r\n one is unable to focus on god amid all the noise. \n&gt; There are two approac=\r\nhes one can take - (1) run away from the noise, \n&gt; find a place of solitude=\r\n and meditate there. (2) rise to the \n&gt; challenge, meditate right there and=\r\n develop the ability to turn off \n&gt; the sensory input to the mind, i.e. get=\r\n mastery and control over the \n&gt; part of the mind that is making one vulner=\r\nable to this disturbance. \n&gt; After all, the noise from outside is NOT the p=\r\nroblem - the problem is \n&gt; the *inability* of one&#39;s mind to turn off that s=\r\nensory input. By \n&gt; controlling one&#39;s mind, one can focus attention on god =\r\nirrespective \n&gt; of what is happening outside.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Approach (1) is no=\r\nt bad. If one is weak-minded and has a decent \n&gt; chance of failure with app=\r\nroach (2), then approach (1) is definitely \n&gt; prudent and worthwhile. But, =\r\nif one has a strong mind and can succeed \n&gt; with approach (2), it is great.=\r\n It hastens one&#39;s progress.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Vaama=\r\nachaara is also like that, but a more extreme form of \n&gt; testing one&#39;s self=\r\n-control by rising to the challenge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Please realize that vaamaac=\r\nhaara/aghora is not about the use of \n&gt; sex, wine etc for the kick of it. I=\r\nt is about their use to test \n&gt; oneself with the toughest challenges and ho=\r\nne one&#39;s self-control. \n&gt; Self-realization comes when self-control is perfe=\r\nct and one&#39;s mind \n&gt; can always be focussed on god no matter what is going =\r\non around one. \n&gt; If one is either attracted or averse to any one thing, th=\r\nat is enough \n&gt; to block self-realization.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   However, if one is we=\r\nak, it is better to stay away from \n&gt; vaamaachaara. One needs to do other p=\r\nractices and strengthen oneself. \n&gt; If a really pure yogi with perfect self=\r\n-control is able to focus on \n&gt; god with all his mind even when he is drunk=\r\n and sitting naked with a \n&gt; beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him, t=\r\nhen he can try that to \n&gt; test his self-control and hone it. But, if that i=\r\ns going to tempt \n&gt; one, get the mind away from god and onto a physical enj=\r\noyment, then \n&gt; one better not try that path! Just as one who does not have=\r\n a strong \n&gt; mind to meditate amid noise should meditate in solitude and ho=\r\nne \n&gt; one&#39;s self-control, one who does not have a strong mind to keep the \n=\r\n&gt; focus on god in the middle of normally depriving practices such as \n&gt; win=\r\ne, meat and sex should stay away from those.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   *        *        *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   In my analogy before, the short jungle path to the sea having t=\r\nhe \n&gt; danger of wild animals and dacoits represents the vaamaachaara path \n=\r\n&gt; of aghora. If one not having the wherewithal to battle and kill the \n&gt; wi=\r\nld animals and dacoits tries that path, one may be killed. \n&gt; Similarly, on=\r\ne who wants self-realization using this path will fall \n&gt; if one does not h=\r\nave perfect self-control. If one takes this path \n&gt; because it sounds cool =\r\nor exciting, one is likely to fall. It is only \n&gt; for the fittest and brave=\r\nst.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   If there is ANY weakness in one&#39;s self-control, one can NOT =\r\n\n&gt; follow this path. Just as there are many paths from the desert to the \n&gt;=\r\n sea in my analogy, there are many paths to self-realization. One \n&gt; should=\r\n follow the path that is appropriate for one based on previous \n&gt; samskaras=\r\n, strengths and weaknesses.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &gt; Is =\r\nit not a fact that Sri Ambal lies above all these? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   :-) Sri Amba=\r\nl (the Divine Mother) does not lie above or below \n&gt; anything. She lies eve=\r\nrywhere! All knowledge, all desires and all \n&gt; actions of all beings are He=\r\nr own different manifestations.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   If a yogi with perfect self-cont=\r\nrol drinks wine and sits naked \n&gt; with a beautiful naked woman tightly embr=\r\nacing him and yet keeps his \n&gt; mind fully focussed on god, his self-control=\r\n, his focus on god are \n&gt; all different manifestations of the Divine Mother=\r\n only.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   As a matter of fact, even if one gives in to base instinc=\r\nts and \n&gt; pursues carnal pleasures, his desires and actions are also differ=\r\nent \n&gt; manifestations of Divine Mother only. The Mother gives rise to so \n&gt;=\r\n many lower level forms with specific domains of responsibility. The \n&gt; Mot=\r\nher takes the form of Lakshmi and Alakshmi as well. She takes the \n&gt; form o=\r\nf Vidya and Avidya as well. All opposites and polarities are \n&gt; actually He=\r\nr manifestations only.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   However, those who are more comfortable w=\r\nith Lakshmi and Vidya \n&gt; and uncomfortable with Alakshmi and Avidya will lo=\r\nok at only the \n&gt; former pair as manifestation of Divine Mother and remain =\r\nin duality. \n&gt; That is a valid point of view. However, the *ultimate* reali=\r\nty is \n&gt; that She is All.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   I need to sleep now. I will stop here.=\r\n Hope that put a few things \n&gt; in perspective. You can send further questio=\r\nns to the yahoogroups or \n&gt; to me privately.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;  =\r\n Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;   ----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt; &gt;   Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ho=\r\nmam\n&gt; &gt;   Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpan=\r\na\n&gt; &gt;   Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;   Free=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt;   Free Jyoti=\r\nsh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;   Sri Jagannath C=\r\nentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;   --------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     Sri Sri Nar=\r\nasimhaJI\n&gt; &gt;     Namaskarams.

We met a couple of years =\r\n\n&gt; ago in &lt;deleted&gt; temple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     I have a few doubts. I would like =\r\nto hear your opinion on the \n&gt; same.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     1. Are Vedic (Pure Vaithi=\r\nka rituals) different from Mantra \n&gt; Shastras (people explain that mantra s=\r\nhastra does not originate from \n&gt; the vedas, but classified under tantra). =\r\nDid Mantra shastras not \n&gt; originate from vedas?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     2. I read fro=\r\nm somewhere that Sri Sri Adi Sankara has condemned \n&gt; Tantrik practices. Bu=\r\nt I also hear and read that he is a great Sri \n&gt; Vidya Upasaka himself. If =\r\nSri Vidya has its roots from Tantra, what \n&gt; did Sri Adi Sankara condemn? \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     3. What is vamachara? if it is the left hand method - sex, \n&gt; =\r\ndrinks etc, why must it be practiced at all? Is it not a fact that \n&gt; Sri A=\r\nmbal lies above all these? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     I am a little (totally) confused. =\r\nHope your reply takes me out \n&gt; of the well to ask you more questions\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;     Namaskarams\n&gt; &gt;     &lt;deleted&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     -- \n&gt; &gt;     Regards\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n    &lt;deleted&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_039D_01C90312.F6E9C560\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3395&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n Jyothi ji,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt; Secondly, can you please help me w=\r\nith a \nquestion? ..snip..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; He was asking me if yoga, be it jnana yog=\r\na, bhakti \nyoga &lt;BR&gt;&gt; or any one, is the only way to attain moksha/reali=\r\nsation, then \nwhat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; will other living organisms like ameoba, bacter=\r\nia and all will do \nto &lt;BR&gt;&gt; attain moksha?

Phala \n(fruits) are d=\r\necided by the Lord. If God wants, a bacteria can get moksha too. \nHowever, =\r\n*usually* god has some rules of action and reaction to uphold and hence \ndo=\r\nes not act out of order.

The laws of karma are complex. Thinking \nlike &quot;this is a noble karma. =\r\nSo it is good only&quot; is incorrect.

All paths are his own and he does not \n=\r\ndistinguish. He does aghora sadhanas in smashana and also Vedic sadhanas li=\r\nke \nVedic homas with the same attitude. He chants Vedic mantras too. For ex=\r\nample, \nwhen he chants Sri Rudram, it produces amazing energy all around. H=\r\ne is a bhakti \nyogi too. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;When he thinks =\r\nof Krishna, he melts in \ndevotion. When he discusses upanishads and other V=\r\nedanta texts such as Yoga \nVaasishtham and BhagavadGita, his keen intellect=\r\n shines forth like a Sun and \nilluminates the thinking of a ready audience.=\r\n I have never seen anyone who has \nsuch a perfect understanding of the esse=\r\nnce of Upanishads and exudes it&nbsp;in \nthoughts, words and actions. &lt;/FON=\r\nT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;He has wife and \nchildren, has a full-time jo=\r\nb and engages in several external activities and is \nnever idle.

Are Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) differ=\r\nent from Mantra \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Shastras&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt; (people ex=\r\nplain that mantra \nshastra does not originate from the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; vedas,&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n&gt; but classified under tantra). Did Mantra shastra=\r\ns not originate &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nfrom vedas?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; When people say =\r\nwhat is in Veda and what is not, honestly I can \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; only laugh. They =\r\nare only fooling themselves. Reciting Veda with \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; perfect swara or =\r\nmastering a celebrated commentary does not help one \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; understand Ve=\r\nda. In fact, understanding each single verse in Veda \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; requires gre=\r\nat tapascharya. Understanding a verse in Veda is neither \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; possible=\r\n with energy flowing in Ida nadi (intuition) nor in Pingala \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; nadi =\r\n(logic and analysis). It is possible only with energy flowing in \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nSushumna nadi. It is possible with neither intuition nor logic, but \n&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; only with *revelation* and simply, for the lack of a better &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nex=\r\npression, direct knowledge.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; When one=\r\n \nmeditates long enough on a verse, the verse may simply &lt;BR&gt;&gt; be reveal=\r\ned to \nthe yogi. THAT is the only way to understand a Vedic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; verse.=\r\n For most \npeople, it is not possible to decipher even a single &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ve=\r\nrse in an entire \nlife, let alone a passage.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; Bottomoline \nis: Almost nobody understands Veda today. What are &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; considered &quot;pure \nvaidika rituals&quot; are merely another variety of &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; rituals created by \nsomeone at some point of time. From the point of =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; view of authenticity \nas granted by Veda, there is no difference &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; between them and other \naagamic rituals, though people ignorantly &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; believe otherwise.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; A simple analogy may help c=\r\nlarify a lot of things related to \nthis &lt;BR&gt;&gt; complicated issue a little=\r\n. What the thing in the analogy \nrepresents &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is shown here and ther=\r\ne in square brackets [].&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Once there=\r\n were many people who lived near the sea \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; [Brahman/Aatman]. They r=\r\negularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and sound of the se=\r\na [experienced Brahman]. They described the sea in \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; some nice cryp=\r\ntic poems [Veda].&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \nAs people started=\r\n living a little away from the sea [less &lt;BR&gt;&gt; spiritually \nevolved], so=\r\nmeone had to put together some instructions &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on how to reach \nthe s=\r\nea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; instructions grew=\r\n \nwith time. People faithfully followed the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; instructions \n[rituals=\r\n].&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; People started moving further \nan=\r\nd further inland and started &lt;BR&gt;&gt; living in a landlocked desert far awa=\r\ny \nfrom the sea. This generation &lt;BR&gt;&gt; had never seen a pool of water li=\r\nke a \nlake, let alone a sea. They &lt;BR&gt;&gt; faithfully performed the ritual =\r\nof walking \ntowards east, but did not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; find sea. They debated endle=\r\nssly whether one \nhad to walk one mile or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; two miles or three miles=\r\n and formed different \nschools of thought. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some walked their chose=\r\nn distance, found a tree or \na building or some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; interesting object=\r\n and even became satisfied that \nthat was sea!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; Then came some great \nperson, whose instincts led him to take a =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; horse instead of walking and \nride it for a long distance [use of =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; other tools]. He did find the sea \nafter a few months. He put toge=\r\nther &lt;BR&gt;&gt; newer instructions to reach the \nsea, which included riding a=\r\n horse &lt;BR&gt;&gt; [new aagamas].&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peop=\r\nle performing the old rituals objected to this and said \n&quot;but &lt;BR&gt;&gt; then=\r\n this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ne=\r\nw path and different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [&quot;pure&quot; Vedic \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ri=\r\ntual]. By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; po=\r\nems of the original &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nthat those poems taught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n used to. They were blissfully unaware that the original instructions \n&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; were meant for someone already close to sea and the newer &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nin=\r\nstructions came from someone who actually saw the sea and knew &lt;BR&gt;&gt; whe=\r\nre \nthey currently lived and how to get to the sea from there!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly many new sets of instructions involving =\r\nhorses, chariots \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; etc were taught and many new paths to the sea we=\r\nre outlined instead \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of just instructing people to walk towards ea=\r\nst [evolution of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nmantra/tantra/yantras].&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&nbsp;&nbsp; One particular \npath through jungles was dangerous [aghora a=\r\nnd &lt;BR&gt;&gt; other dark tantric paths \ninvolving practice of sex, meat, wine=\r\n etc]. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though the distance to sea \nwas much shorter through that j=\r\nungle, it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was just too dangerous and \nonly the bravest and stronge=\r\nst could make &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it. There were cruel dacoits \nand wild animals [chan=\r\nce of a fall in a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; risky ritual] and many weak \npeople travelling t=\r\no sea via that path &lt;BR&gt;&gt; were killed. A wise man who knew \nthe entire t=\r\nerritory well came &lt;BR&gt;&gt; forward, condemned that path and \ndiscouraged p=\r\neople from trying that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; path. Since then, even people who \nwere str=\r\nong enough to successfully &lt;BR&gt;&gt; make it in that path desisted from \nit.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; As time progressed, people started =\r\n\nfighting too much about whose &lt;BR&gt;&gt; path was superior. They were foolis=\r\nh, not \nsmart enough to adopt the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; original instructions, of either=\r\n the \nso-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; so-called &quot;new&quot; path or oth=\r\ner \nvariations, for the changed geography &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and changed times. Many =\r\nfollowed \nthe instructions blindly, hit &lt;BR&gt;&gt; roadblocks and did not rea=\r\nch sea. Many \ndid not even know &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the ac=\r\ntual goal of all \ntheir joirneys. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; They only thought they were supp=\r\nosed to follow the \ninstructions &lt;BR&gt;&gt; faithfully and there was no need =\r\nto adopt to the changed \ngeographical &lt;BR&gt;&gt; territory and time. They eve=\r\nn condemned those who actually \nwent to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sea, came back and gave up=\r\ndated directions for their place and \ntime, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; for violating traditio=\r\nn.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; In case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief s=\r\nummary of \nits &lt;BR&gt;&gt; points. Veda is about realizing self. Veda describe=\r\ns various \naspects &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of the state of self-realization. That is why i=\r\nt is considered \nthe &lt;BR&gt;&gt; highest knowledge. Other allied subjects thro=\r\nw some light on \npossible &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ways to reach that state. While definiti=\r\nve statements can be \nmade on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the actual state of self-realization=\r\n itself, no definitive \nstatements &lt;BR&gt;&gt; can be made on how to reach it.=\r\n The path depends on one&#39;s \ncurrent &lt;BR&gt;&gt; position!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Great men in \nmany spiritual paths, within Hinduism as w=\r\nell as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; outside of it, came, \nexperienced that state, understood th=\r\ne current &lt;BR&gt;&gt; state of people around \nthem and gave specific instructi=\r\nons on how to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; r\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
