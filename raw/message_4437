Do they work? I will give my =\r\n2 cents of views based on my experience and insights. I will be honest, str=\r\naight-forward and blunt.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though believers c=\r\nall priests and get poojas done, in the hope that their problems will be so=\r\nlved, many priests today are incapable of producing any results. As a resul=\r\nt, some believers got accustomed to accepting that a pudding exists even wi=\r\nthout eating it and remain hungry throughout life. And some intelligent peo=\r\nple stopped believing in god and in remedies. Let me first address why this=\r\n has come to be and then talk about what we should do.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In ancient tim=\r\nes, caste system was not as rigid as it is today. One&#39;s varna was decided b=\r\nased on one&#39;s aptitude. One primarily interested in knowledge and spiritual=\r\n progress would be a Brahmana. One primarily interested in power, authority=\r\n and control over others would be a Kshatriya. One primarily interested in =\r\nmoney would be a Vaisya. One primarily interested in physical pleasures wou=\r\nld be a Shudra. One would start off with the varna of one&#39;s father, as that=\r\n is what one is exposed to in childhood. However, as one&#39;s vasana (mental c=\r\nonditioning) blooms, one would get one&#39;s own varna. One born a Shudra like =\r\nValmiki, for example, can later turn into a Braahmana and become a Maharshi=\r\n. One born a Kshatriya like Viswamitra, for example, can later turn into a =\r\nBrahmana and become a Maharshi.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the old days, there were true Brah=\r\nmanas, who would only be interested in knowledge and spiritual progress and=\r\n not caring about power, influence, money, pleasures etc. Such Brahmanas be=\r\ncame quite pure and accumulated enough spiritual energy through continuous =\r\nsadhana over years and were capable of performing very effective poojas for=\r\n people.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Today, people who have spiritual potential may be born in no=\r\nn-Brahmana families and not allowed to develop fully due to the rigid caste=\r\n structures. Some people born in Brahmana families may also end up getting =\r\ninto modern careers and not developing fully as Brahmanas. Some people may =\r\nbe born in Brahmana families with Kshatriya/Vaisya/Shudra tendencies and ma=\r\ny end up becoming priests who are interested in power, authority and contro=\r\nl over others, money and physical pleasures. Those priests who only care ab=\r\nout knowledge and spiritual progress (i.e. true Brahmanas) are very rare. A=\r\ns a result, Brahmanas who have done genuine sadhana and accumulated a good =\r\namount of spiritual energy are so few.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; If o=\r\nne has one million dollars in one&#39;s bank account, a check given by one for =\r\nthousand dollars is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is empty, what good i=\r\ns a thousand dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas d=\r\none and blessings given by a priest without enough spiritual energy cannot =\r\nbring one any benefits.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One important note: The power is not in a com=\r\nbination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). =\r\nThe power is in the MIND that FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra=\r\n) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind=\r\n overcomes its tendency to wander and instead focuses on one thing. Differe=\r\nnt mantras and rituals as the focus points may generate different kinds of =\r\nenergy, but the key is focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual produces anyt=\r\nhing. Focus comes with a lot of practice. Most priests are just engaging in=\r\n casual practice when they go and do poojas. In the old days, priests did i=\r\nntense sadhana and brought that energy to the table when they did rituals a=\r\nt the houses of people or in temples.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I did see priests who have done=\r\n good sadhana, purified themselves and carry some spiritual energy. But tho=\r\nse are getting rarer and rarer now-a-days. One can most certainly not bank =\r\non finding such a priest.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Given this, one i=\r\ns better off not depending on the priest/Brahmana class for remedies. BTW, =\r\nI have nothing against the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; class, having been born in a=\r\nn orthodox Brahmana family myself. I have neither love nor hatred for the &quot;=\r\nBrahmana by birth&quot; class. My only wish is that more people - from any birth=\r\n caste - develop into true Brahmanas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Instead of a Brahmana-by-birth =\r\nwho is possibly proud of his skills and thinking about money and possibly n=\r\not identifying with your trouble, you can do the mantra/ritual yourself. At=\r\nleast your identification with the trouble and your desire to solve the pro=\r\nblem will be better than the priest. If you manage to generate enough focus=\r\n after practice, the mantra/ritual may actually produce some result. There =\r\nis no harm in trying.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Many people think tha=\r\nt poojas to gods are a serious matter and only a trained priest should do t=\r\nhem. The procedures have evolved to become quite complicated over the time =\r\ntoo!\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, complexity of rituals should never be a deterrent. Supp=\r\nose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams of pro=\r\ntein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access to such ba=\r\nlanced food. Will you starve yourself until you find a balanced meal or wil=\r\nl you manage with whatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil=\r\n soup) and rice, you will simply eat it. You atleast get some energy.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n Similarly, if you do not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a mantra/ritual, you=\r\n need not wait till you know the perfect way. You can start with what you k=\r\nnow. It will only give you energy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The fear=\r\n to do rituals without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems from the notion that some =\r\nmantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion is not totally baseless, but =\r\nit is irrelevant today.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is possible to focus the mind on some mant=\r\nras and rituals and get specific results. When used by someone with a high =\r\nlevel of spiritual energy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast and =\r\ngive specific powerful results. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almos=\r\nt) such things in this age.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I will give an analogy. A machine gun and=\r\n a stick can be used to attack enemies. Stick is safe to use, but, one usin=\r\ng a machine gun needs to be very careful. One needs to learn well, practice=\r\n well and then use it, lest one should hurt oneself by accident.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Howe=\r\nver, suppose the house lord purposely removed ammunition from the machine g=\r\nun. Then it is used just like a stick and not risky. Instead of waiting for=\r\n perfect instructions on how to use the machine gun, just take it and start=\r\n beating your enemies with it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &quot;Ammunition&quot; has purposely been remove=\r\nd from most targeted mantras and rituals (machine guns) in this age. Instea=\r\nd of waiting for perfect knowledge, one can start using them right away.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; A lot of technicalities related to mantras and rituals are irrelevant t=\r\noday. Mantras and rituals are to be taken up with faith, devotion and surre=\r\nnder to god. Whatever technicalities one can realistically follow should be=\r\n followed and emphasis should be placed on devotion and surrender. If one k=\r\neeps doing sadhana, eventually one&#39;s devotion and focus will improve and, f=\r\nor all you know, a result may come.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Given that we do not have perfect=\r\n focus and surrender, we cannot expect specific results to come in specific=\r\n counts of recitation. So we should just do the best job we can and leave t=\r\nhe result to god, who decides when and what result should be given.\n&gt;  \n&gt; B=\r\nottomline is that no effort is wasted in the end. Every sincere effort gene=\r\nrates some fruit or the other, sometime or the other!!!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *   =\r\n     *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Different mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of differ=\r\nent shapes. They matter only so much. Depending on what kind of a begging b=\r\nowl you use, you may be given different kind of alms. But it is important t=\r\no start begging with some begging bowl or the other, instead of spending ye=\r\nars looking for the perfect begging bowl.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Instead of waiting for astr=\r\nologers with half-baked or ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfect =\r\nmantra or ritual, do what your heart tells you or what your guru (or an eld=\r\ner you respect) tells you. Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva panchakshari =\r\nmantra, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha, Hanuman chal=\r\nisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu&#39;s shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwadasaksh=\r\nari mantra, Venkateswara&#39;s ashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, hare krishna m=\r\nantra, Chandipath (Durga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaam=\r\na stotra, Vyasa&#39;s navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi ashtottarashat=\r\nanaama stotra etc are *generic* and can work for anyone for any purpose.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; Do not waste time looking for a perfect recommendation, perfect procedu=\r\nre, perfect muhurta etc and just do some sadhana or the other with a sincer=\r\ne heart.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Your effort will not go waste. Your problem may be solved or=\r\n you may overcome your situation and stop worrying, or atleast your focus w=\r\nill improve.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; In this context, I want to say=\r\n a few words about homam, the sadhana of rishis.\n&gt; \n&gt; Fire ritual is found =\r\nin many ancient religions. Unlike the elements of earth, water and air, fir=\r\ne is ever pure and it purifies whatever it comes in contact with. The Sansk=\r\nrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e.  purifier. Fire is a living god that eve=\r\nryone has access to. Spending time worshipping god through fire purifies on=\r\ne&#39;s subtle consciousness. Homam is far more effective than most other sadha=\r\nnas in improving one&#39;s focus, changing one&#39;s inner personality and removing=\r\n material and spiritual obstacles. One need not take my words for granted. =\r\nOne can try for oneself for a few months. The proof of the pudding is in ea=\r\nting it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Vedic seers (rishis) performed homam regularly, for the bene=\r\nfit of the world. When composing the Jyotish masterpiece &quot;Brihat Paaraasara=\r\n Horaa Saastram&quot; just before the advent of Kali yuga, for guidance to the p=\r\neople of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara recommended various types of homam as=\r\n remedial measures for various problems in the horoscope. In fact, most rem=\r\nedies he recommended involve homam. Parasara asked to follow whatever proce=\r\ndures one was taught for starting fire and did not focus on the nitty gritt=\r\ny of homam. He only gave the main mantra to beused in homam. Parasara&#39;s cle=\r\nar teachings set to rest the notion that some people have, that homam is no=\r\nt for Kali yuga.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; In Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krish=\r\nna said, &quot;yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi&quot;, i.e. I am japa among all sacrifices. =\r\nSome people use this line to suggest that japam (meditation) is superior to=\r\n homa/yajna. Let me put that in perspective.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the line just above t=\r\nhat line, Sri Krishna also said, &quot;I am Om among all mantras&quot;. However, do w=\r\ne only meditate with the supreme mantra &quot;Om&quot; and leave all other mantras?\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; If one says that sitting on the pinnacle is the best part of climbing =\r\na mountain, it does not mean that the process of climbing it using various =\r\nkinds of gear is useless. In fact, one needs that process to reach the pinn=\r\nacle. Most cannot reach the pinnacle directly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, Om is the s=\r\nupreme of all mantras being the source of all, but reaching the source may =\r\nrequire using several mantras first to purify oneself. Meditating and absor=\r\nbing consciousness in the Supreme (japa) may be the supreme sacrifice, but =\r\nit may require purification and preparation by engaging in other kinds of s=\r\nacrifices (hama/yajna).\n&gt;  \n&gt; When one does homam or yajna, one is engaging=\r\n in external actions and one is unlikely to reach samadhi (absorbption in t=\r\nhe Supreme). When a perfectly purified person does japam (i.e. sits still a=\r\nnd contemplates), one may reach samadhi. However, to purify oneself, homam =\r\nis far more effective.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Detailed manuals giv=\r\ning short procedures for doing various types of homam by oneself are availa=\r\nble on the website given below. You can use the resources on that website t=\r\no perform several kinds of short homam by yourself.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Now *hundreds* of=\r\n people are performing homam by themselves either daily or weekly. Some peo=\r\nple are also doing monthly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When Manish (my spiritual guru - a small =\r\nwrite-up on him can be read in message 3481 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, i.e=\r\n. http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481) told me that the=\r\n Divine Mother appeared before him during Shata Chandi homam at a temple in=\r\n Chennai in March 2006, directed him to spread a simplified homam ritual ar=\r\nound the world, and showed him that hundreds of thousands of people would b=\r\ne performing regular homam in a few years, thus helping reverse the decay o=\r\nf Dharma and Truth on earth, it seemed quite far-fetched to my rational min=\r\nd.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, just 4 years after the Mother&#39;s command, hundreds of peop=\r\nle are already performing regular homam. Though these are just the early da=\r\nys, the developments are amazing. Some of them are laymen who never even li=\r\nt a lamp and did not know how to do ANY pooja or ritual. It is a miracle th=\r\nat such people are doing a homam everyday, like the rishis and Brahmanas of=\r\n yore. I also know personally that some people doing homam for a couple of =\r\nyears are actually starting to experience things within and outside and, mo=\r\nre importantly, going through rapid internal transformation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *       =\r\n *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am neither a missionary nor a mercenary. I do not sell =\r\nanything to anyone, nor do I force anything on anyone. I just freely share =\r\nwhat I know, what I saw and what I am inspired to share. The rest is not in=\r\n my hands.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I want to respectfully, humbly and lovingly invite those w=\r\nho have even an iota of interest to check out the homam website! If one get=\r\ns into the habit of performing homam regularly, it has the great potential =\r\nto transform one&#39;s life, materially and spiritually..\n&gt;  \n&gt; Homam website:\n=\r\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free =\r\nJyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself=\r\n&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://Sar=\r\naswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wi=\r\nsdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; =\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
