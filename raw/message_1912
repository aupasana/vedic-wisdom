Vasishtha reveals the true nature of Rama then and \nRama remains in samadhi. Vasishtha has to finally enter the Sushumna nadi of \nRama to disturb his samadhi and bring him back to senses. After that, Rama \nknows who he is.\n\nRama and Krishna were both avataras of Vishnu. Krishna knew it from the \nbeginning. In the case of Rama, sages like Vasishtha, Vishwamitra knew it \neven before Rama&#39;s birth, but Rama himself did not know it in the beginning. \nBut he too knew it later.\n\nHowever, Krishna had complete mastery over the duality, while Rama did not. \nRama had to wade the dual world like normal people. Krishna could do any \nmanipulation of the dual world that he wanted.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, June 03, 2009 3:45 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Rama as God\n\n\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt;\n&gt; In a discussion with another very learned individual, I was told this \n&gt; following statement:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Valmiki had projected Ram as a person who tried his level best to live by \n&gt; principles. He was still not God. Or, at least, he never realised he was \n&gt; an avatar (one who undergoes an &#39;avataran&#39; (coming down to earth to serve \n&gt; a specific purpose of the society of his time).\n&gt;\n&gt; It was latter day writers like Tulsidas who conferred godhood on Ram.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Is this true? Is there any verse in the original Valmiki Ramayana which \n&gt; shows divinity (avatarahood) on Rama?\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
