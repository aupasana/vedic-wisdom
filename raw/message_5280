I try to Penn down as below:\n\n1=\r\n) In &quot;Autobiography of A Yogi&quot;, if i remember correctly, Its mentioned that=\r\n once Mahaavatar Babaji wished to dissolve the body i.e. physical form but =\r\nhe was advised not to do so by his divine Sister and then Babaji said that =\r\nIts a *DIVINE WISH* which has come out from the sister and so he would stay=\r\n till the end of this yuga.\n\n2) Vimalananda has categorically emphasized th=\r\nat the Final Boss is a certain Senior Rishi who is in the centre of Rishi M=\r\nandala and he controls the Adhya Shakti and hence control the complete crea=\r\ntion\n\n3) Ramakrishna used to tell one story to his gatherings - Once Krishn=\r\na took Arjuna in some other realm to show him some wonder. Both came at som=\r\ne place where Arujan saw a gigantic tree and countless fruits hangning on t=\r\nhe tree. Krishna asked Arjuna to just take a closer look at it and he was a=\r\nstonished to see the fruits were actually as many Krishnas. Krishna then to=\r\nld Arjuna that this is tree called Brahma in which produces many Krishna.\n\n=\r\nThe above 3 were the exact thoughts came one after the other in my mind. I =\r\nwas trying to synthesize and derive the essence of all these thoughts. Only=\r\n one common thing i could gather is that, there is ONE POWER HOUSE - The so=\r\nurce of all which is recognized by very very High divine beings like Shri K=\r\nrishna, Ramakrishna, Mahaavtar Babaji, Vimalananda and such many others. Vi=\r\nshnu, Brahma and Shiva and all the other we think of including ourselves ar=\r\ne from that source. The whole creation including all universes known and un=\r\nknown along with their Gods are from that single source. \n\nI do not know if=\r\n my message was relevant to the topic but some how I thought that way. Supr=\r\na-conscious ness probably is one more stage in the hierarchy wherein your d=\r\nivinity is raised to such highest level wherein the Power house called Brah=\r\nman provides you with option of retaining a *divine physical body* as long =\r\nas one desires or probably as per Brahman&#39;s desire while at the same time r=\r\netaining the Brahman consciousness. I have actually come round to Narasimha=\r\n&#39;s view and probably that seems to be the highest state which we one can lo=\r\nok up to, which is probably Supra-consciousness of Aurobindo and which was =\r\nachieved by Krishna, Mahaavatar Babaji and such others. \n\nBest Regards,\n\nUt=\r\npal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for this mail. Now, I understand better wher=\r\ne you coming from!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; it could only be your imagination that I have any=\r\n sympathies for him\n&gt; \n&gt; Quite possible and my apologies if so.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWhat does the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?\n&gt; &gt; This qu=\r\nestion was asked because you were trying to compare apples with oranges\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Well, it is more like comparing sweet apples to gross (and yet colorful) =\r\nworms.\n&gt; \n&gt; All scriptures such as Yoga Vaasishtham and Upanishads tell us =\r\nthat self-realization is the only worthy goal of sadhana and that other abi=\r\nlities, siddhis and attainments are useless and not worth pursuing. As I me=\r\nntioned earlier, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa proposed to give some siddhis to V=\r\nivekananda and the latter rejected them because they would not help him in =\r\nrealizing god. Siddhis and other abilities that come without a conscious pu=\r\nrsuit can be accepted with neither excitement nor regret, but they are not =\r\nworth pursuing consciously.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see any reason, why an afterlife=\r\n would bring me\n&gt; &gt; greater truth than where I am now.\n&gt; \n&gt; No, this is not=\r\n an issue of afterlife. One can do sadhana and realize Self even when alive=\r\n and then live as a jeevanmukta flowing with divine will.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bottomli=\r\nne is that as long as ego and individual will are present, one is moved by =\r\nthe force of individual will and stuck in the game of actions and reactions=\r\n. Once they are effaced, one flows with divine will and is out of the game =\r\nof actions and reactions.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is Sense-experience is not diff=\r\nerent from Ananda,\n&gt; &gt; and Physical body not different from Chit.\n&gt; &gt; ...\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; So, lets attempt to divinze Physical form, in accordance with\n&gt; &gt; highes=\r\nt ideal of Aurobindo, like the Mahaavatar babaji has done,\n&gt; &gt; because its =\r\nbasis is Sat-Chid-Ananada. And we need to learn about\n&gt; &gt; all the achieveme=\r\nnts made by all those we can know of, irrespective\n&gt; &gt; of their being recog=\r\nnized as good or bad\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all, Ravana is NOT an example of the att=\r\nainment of the &quot;highest ideal of Aurobindo&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aurobindo&#39;s ideals have b=\r\neen misunderstood by many learned people to mean that he was striving for p=\r\nhysical immortality. He sadly ended up attracting some wrong people that wa=\r\ny.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is possible to remove the distinction between manifested things =\r\nand Brahman and view them as non-different. But that state is not attainabl=\r\ne by even great yogis. Moreover, that state is not achieved by actively pur=\r\nsuing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; The best course of action for any sadhaka is to ignore the p=\r\nhysical form, overcome the fascination for it and its needs, realize the un=\r\nderlying Self and live as a jeevanmukta like a leaf flowing in wind. If one=\r\n is meant to divinize physical form like Mahavatar Babaji has done, divine =\r\nwill will then make one to do so. But, one consciously pursuing it is likel=\r\ny to retain fascination for the physical form, not realize Self and get now=\r\nhere.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyoti=\r\nsh Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Ta=\r\nrpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a difference: htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;=\r\n ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- silen=\r\ntadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt; One thing is cl=\r\near that Ravana is not my kin, thus, it could only be your imagination that=\r\n I have any sympathies for him or Rama.

What I have tried t=\r\no state so far, w.r.t &quot;Success with Mantra&quot; topic, is that No matter how ha=\r\nrd one tries, Ravanas&#39; or Ramas&#39; achievements in the field of &quot;duality&quot; can=\r\nnot be erased by any amount of &quot;Highest shakti&quot; with or without Ego.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Reason lies in what Aurobindo states as Sat-chid-ananda as the basis of a=\r\nll planes of existence including Physical plane of existence. Argument of I=\r\nmpermanence by Advaitins has not so far been able to erase the world of dua=\r\nlity from existence. As per Aurobindo, Ananda is the basis of sense-mind, C=\r\nhit is the basis of Physical consciousness, and Sat is the basis of existen=\r\nce of Physical plane, so lets not argue that there is another reality which=\r\n is better and happier than this one, and that this world is a myth. If phy=\r\nsical sense-experience is fleeting, it is because one has not progressed en=\r\nough to realize why the truth of being is expressed in such a way at this p=\r\nlane of existence ?\n&gt; &gt; Bottomline is Sense-experience is not different fro=\r\nm Ananda, and Physical body not different from Chit.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; high lev=\r\nel of ability to manipulate objects in the field of duality,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cann=\r\not compete with perfect self-control and egolessness. The\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What =\r\ndoes the &quot;highest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?\n&gt; &gt; This questio=\r\nn was asked because you were trying to compare apples with oranges, by sayi=\r\nng that (egolessness) soul consciousness competes with ego consciousness, p=\r\nresuming that they act upon each other.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Truth of the matter is that=\r\n Soul is not in competition with ego consciousness ever, because God is nev=\r\ner in competition with his creation !! If a liberated soul wants to take pa=\r\nrt in an ego competition (Yada Yada hee Dharmasya), it has to have an ego, =\r\nhowever high, like that of an avatar. Krishna took the wheel of the chariot=\r\n and tried to kill Bhishma, not without an ego. Other people may differ wit=\r\nh me on this.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I see inconsistencies in your views and a biased an=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; OTOH, I see a lot of consistency in this mail exchange than the last =\r\ntime. It is understandable that my view wouldn&#39;t be consistent in every min=\r\nd-set, because at times, it is not possible to write every little detail fo=\r\nr the sake of consistency.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But the happiness one gets when one ac=\r\nhieves something in the field &gt; of duality is not permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne highest shakti gives the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-ananda,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which=\r\n is permanent.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo Ghosh has clearly stated:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;...If t=\r\nhe immortal and infinite spirit has veiled itself in Matter and is emerging=\r\n, the development of a liberated Supramental being who shall impose in Mind=\r\n, Life and Matter a higher law than that of limitation and Division, is the=\r\n inevitable conclusion from the nature of the cosmic existence. There is no=\r\n reason why such a being should not liberate and make Divine the physical e=\r\nxistence as well as the Mind and Life....&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So, lets attempt to divi=\r\nnze Physical form, in accordance with highest ideal of Aurobindo, like the =\r\nMahaavatar babaji has done, because its basis is Sat-Chid-Ananada. And we n=\r\need to learn about all the achievements made by all those we can know of, i=\r\nrrespective of their being recognized as good or bad by a limited set of pe=\r\nople, for a limited duration of time.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; These are just a few of my vi=\r\news based on what I have read so far, because I don&#39;t see any reason, why a=\r\nn afterlife would bring me greater truth than where I am now.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regar=\r\nds,\n&gt; &gt; Aryama\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR R=\r\nao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You say that &quot;Killing=\r\n Ravana was not a great deed&quot; and yet look at &quot;binding the physical body of=\r\n both Ram and Lakshman&quot; as a &quot;great deed&quot;. I see inconsistencies in your vi=\r\news and a biased and sympathetic attitutde towards Ravana and his kin. Anyw=\r\nay, I will just make a couple of specific points on shakti, which is a subt=\r\nle topic and not easy to understand.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a mundane level, Shak=\r\nti is Memory.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If memory is extended the longest, the most funda=\r\nmental and first memory should say that one is Brahman. If one&#39;s memory ext=\r\nends that far, that creates the highest Shakti! In other words, self-realiz=\r\nation brings the highest shakti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;highest shakt=\r\ni&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Great question!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Any lower shakti is an ability to perform actions with objects in the fiel=\r\nd of duality. Why does one perform actions and manipulate the objects in th=\r\ne field of duality? Because one is pursuing happiness of some kind or the o=\r\nther. But the happiness one gets when one achieves something in the field o=\r\nf duality is not permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The highest shakti gives the highes=\r\nt bliss, i.e. sat-chid-ananda, which is permanent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one is =\r\npursuing an individual will, one may be swimming with or against the divine=\r\n will. One will have some successes and some failures, some pleasures and s=\r\nome pains. When one&#39;s individual will has dropped off and one is flowing wi=\r\nth the rhythm of the divine will, one is in bliss no matter what one does. =\r\nOne *can* do anything, but one does only what divine rhythm wills done by o=\r\nne!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Only the fully detached Shiva can beget Shakti in totality =\r\nand demons like Ravana or Mahisha or Shumbha can only get some trappings of=\r\n Shakti but can never beget Shakti in totality.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A demon like Hi=\r\nranyakashipu or Ravana may kill or imprison a self-realized rishi. It may s=\r\neem like the demon has more shakti. But the rishi is in bliss whether he is=\r\n alive or being killed, whether he is at his hermitage or in prison. The ha=\r\nppiness demons got from their successes were short-lived and ended later. B=\r\nut the rishi was in constant bliss. So the rishi&#39;s shakti was superior.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why then fight like mortals, taking help from mortal allies ?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, just order Rudra to finish the life of all ones&#39; enemies ?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is the thing with shakti. Shakti is the ability to do thing=\r\ns in the field of duality. Just as you do not give important work to irresp=\r\nonsible people, any level of shakti never goes to people who do not know ho=\r\nw to handle that level of shakti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, if a rishi wanted, he co=\r\nuld&#39;ve summoned Rudra to finish off Ravana or Hiranyakashipu. But, a rishi =\r\nis in bliss no matter what and does not break divine rhythm. If Sita, Rama =\r\nand Hanuman have to come to earth and establish certain lessons for future =\r\nand take care of Ravana, a rishi will let that happen and not do anything h=\r\nasty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyo=\r\ntish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for s=\r\nhort Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fi=\r\nlms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer=\r\n_in@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Lord Rama defeated and kil=\r\nled Ravana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Killing Ravana was not a great deed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ravana had=\r\n done that 10 times himself, beheading his own head, but the shakti of his =\r\nsadhana was such that he got a new head every time to continue the sadhana.=\r\n On a deeper level, it is Rudra that finally effects the death of Physical =\r\nconsciousness, so even that part is not in the hands of a mortal Physical f=\r\norm.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you still put Ravana above Rama in shakti, I\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; question your understanding of what &quot;shakti&quot; is.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a mundane=\r\n level, Shakti is Memory. Hanumaan realized his shakti only after he was re=\r\nminded of it. Karna, in the final battle, forgot his Shastra vidya because =\r\nof the curse of his Guru. Generalizing, Shakti is the ability to remember t=\r\nhe series of actions to be done to effect a cause lawfully, irrespective of=\r\n the doer. Thus, Hanumaan had perfect memory by birth, and not by the assoc=\r\niation with Rama.

Meghnaad was son of Ravana. If=\r\n it were not for Hanumaan, and Garuda using divine powers, the result would=\r\n have been different.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Despite all, without Vibhishana revea=\r\nling the secrets, it was impossible to kill Ravana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even =\r\na high level of understanding of the field of duality and even &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; high level of ability to manipulate objects in the field of duality,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete with perfect self-control and egolessness.

Compete with lower shakti ? Why then=\r\n fight like mortals, taking help from mortal allies ? Instead, just order R=\r\nudra to finish the life of all ones&#39; enemies ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egolessness =\r\nis not a shakti, but a quality of Soul consciousness, in the same manner as=\r\n Ego is a quality of Physical creation. It reveals a manner of operating ha=\r\nrmoniously with Nature, without creating conflicts, something that Ravana d=\r\nidn&#39;t know.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aryama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How much purity is enou=\r\ngh and for what purpose ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Different levels of purity ca=\r\nn generate different results (and traps!),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; based on one&#39;s backgro=\r\nund.

It is not to erase\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some con=\r\nditioning, get some siddhi or get some results. If some siddhis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd results come, one can accept them.

Thus, a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person still afflicted by undesirable conditioning may acquire e=\r\nnough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purity to get some results.

A person with ego and pride =\r\nmay suppress pride\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and self-importance out of no choice, for se=\r\nlf-preservation. If one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later gets a chance to exert one&#39;s prid=\r\ne without sacrificing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-preservation, one may still do so.

But, when the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surrender is uncon=\r\nditional and one sees god as the controller of all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without any =\r\nconditions attached, irrespective of whether life is good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or ba=\r\nd, one becomes purer and purer and one&#39;s self-control become\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be=\r\ntter and better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A powerless person may also become angry. But,=\r\n as you said, his anger\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is powerless to do much harm. As one&#39;s =\r\nself-control increases, one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendency to become angry comes do=\r\nwn. That increases one&#39;s power. A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person who has a perfect self=\r\n-control like Shiva is infinitely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; powerful. From where we are t=\r\no there, there is a continuum.

I truly believe that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; would be more useful and powerful than prescribing remedies\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; which may or may not work(with possible high degree of er=\r\nror\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; possibilities in the charts).

I try to Penn down as below:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) In &quot;Autobiography of A =\r\nYogi&quot;, if i remember correctly, Its mentioned that once Mahaavatar Babaji w=\r\nished to dissolve the body i.e. physical form but he was\n advised not to do=\r\n so by his divine Sister and then Babaji said that Its a *DIVINE WISH* whic=\r\nh has come out from the sister and so he would stay till the end of this yu=\r\nga.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) Vimalananda has categorically emphasized that the Final Boss =\r\nis a certain Senior Rishi who is in the centre of Rishi Mandala and he cont=\r\nrols the Adhya Shakti and hence control the complete creation&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3) Ram=\r\nakrishna used to tell one story to his gatherings - Once Krishna took Arjun=\r\na in some other realm to show him some wonder. Both came at some place wher=\r\ne Arujan saw a gigantic tree and countless fruits hangning on the tree. Kri=\r\nshna asked Arjuna to just take a closer look at it and he was astonished to=\r\n see the fruits were actually as many Krishnas. Krishna then told Arjuna th=\r\nat this is tree called Brahma in which produces many Krishna.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The ab=\r\nove 3 were the exact thoughts came one after the other in my mind. I was tr=\r\nying to synthesize and derive the essence of all\n these thoughts. Only one =\r\ncommon thing i could gather is that, there is ONE POWER HOUSE - The source =\r\nof all which is recognized by very very High divine beings like Shri Krishn=\r\na, Ramakrishna, Mahaavtar Babaji, Vimalananda and such many others. Vishnu,=\r\n Brahma and Shiva and all the other we think of including ourselves are fro=\r\nm that source. The whole creation including all universes known and unknown=\r\n along with their Gods are from that single source. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I do not know i=\r\nf my message was relevant to the topic but some how I thought that way. Sup=\r\nra-conscious ness probably is one more stage in the hierarchy wherein your =\r\ndivinity is raised to such highest level wherein the Power house called Bra=\r\nhman provides you with option of retaining a *divine physical body* as long=\r\n as one desires or probably as per Brahman&#39;s desire while at the same time =\r\nretaining the Brahman consciousness. I have actually come round to Narasimh=\r\na&#39;s view and probably that seems to be the\n highest state which we one can =\r\nlook up to, which is probably Supra-consciousness of Aurobindo and which wa=\r\ns achieved by Krishna, Mahaavatar Babaji and such others. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best Rega=\r\nrds,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.com/m=\r\nc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_bla=\r\nnk ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&lt;/A&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namast=\r\ne Sir,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks for this mail.

Compete with lower shakti ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This question was asked b=\r\necause you were trying to compare apples with oranges&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Well=\r\n, it is more like comparing sweet apples to\n gross (and yet colorful) worms=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; All scriptures such as Yoga Vaasishtham and Upanishads t=\r\nell us that self-realization is the only worthy goal of sadhana and that ot=\r\nher abilities, siddhis and attainments are useless and not worth pursuing. =\r\nAs I mentioned earlier, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa proposed to give some siddh=\r\nis to Vivekananda and the latter rejected them because they would not help =\r\nhim in realizing god. Siddhis and other abilities that come without a consc=\r\nious pursuit can be accepted with neither excitement nor regret, but they a=\r\nre not worth pursuing consciously.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t see any re=\r\nason, why an afterlife would bring me&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; greater truth than where=\r\n I am now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; No, this is not an issue of afterlife. One can =\r\ndo sadhana and realize Self even when alive and then live as a jeevanmukta =\r\nflowing with divine will.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The bottomline is that as long a=\r\ns ego and individual will are\n present, one is moved by the force of indivi=\r\ndual will and stuck in the game of actions and reactions. Once they are eff=\r\naced, one flows with divine will and is out of the game of actions and reac=\r\ntions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bottomline is Sense-experience is not differen=\r\nt from Ananda,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and Physical body not different from Chit.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; So, lets attempt to divinze Physical form, in acc=\r\nordance with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; highest ideal of Aurobindo, like the Mahaavatar b=\r\nabaji has done,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; because its basis is Sat-Chid-Ananada. And we =\r\nneed to learn about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; all the achievements made by all those we =\r\ncan know of, irrespective&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of their being recognized as good or=\r\n bad&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; First of all, Ravana is NOT an example of the attainm=\r\nent of the &quot;highest ideal of Aurobindo&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Aurobindo&#39;s ideal=\r\ns have been misunderstood by many learned people to mean that he was strivi=\r\nng for physical\n immortality. He sadly ended up attracting some wrong peopl=\r\ne that way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is possible to remove the distinction betwe=\r\nen manifested things and Brahman and view them as non-different. But that s=\r\ntate is not attainable by even great yogis. Moreover, that state is not ach=\r\nieved by actively pursuing it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The best course of action f=\r\nor any sadhaka is to ignore the physical form, overcome the fascination for=\r\n it and its needs, realize the underlying Self and live as a jeevanmukta li=\r\nke a leaf flowing in wind. If one is meant to divinize physical form like M=\r\nahavatar Babaji has done, divine will will then make one to do so. But, one=\r\n consciously pursuing it is likely to retain fascination for the physical f=\r\norm, not realize Self and get nowhere.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana=\r\n:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Films that make a diff=\r\nerence: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_bla=\r\nnk&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_bl=\r\nank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- silenta=\r\ndmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaskar,&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; One thing is clear that Ravana is not my kin, thus, it could only be=\r\n your imagination that I have any sympathies for him or Rama. I am amongst =\r\nthe general populace of\n the world - to me, only the greatness part of the =\r\ntwo characters have any meaning, not their faults and fallacies, but I don&#39;=\r\nt eulogize either of them neither demean them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I =\r\nam not a philosopher. What I have tried to state so far, w.r.t &quot;Success wit=\r\nh Mantra&quot; topic, is that No matter how hard one tries, Ravanas&#39; or Ramas&#39; a=\r\nchievements in the field of &quot;duality&quot; cannot be erased by any amount of &quot;Hi=\r\nghest shakti&quot; with or without Ego.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Reason lies in=\r\n what Aurobindo states as Sat-chid-ananda as the basis of all planes of exi=\r\nstence including Physical plane of existence. Argument of Impermanence by A=\r\ndvaitins has not so far been able to erase the world of duality from existe=\r\nnce. As per Aurobindo, Ananda is the basis of sense-mind, Chit is the basis=\r\n of Physical consciousness, and Sat is the basis of existence of Physical p=\r\nlane, so lets not argue that there is another reality which is better and h=\r\nappier than this\n one, and that this world is a myth. If physical sense-exp=\r\nerience is fleeting, it is because one has not progressed enough to realize=\r\n why the truth of being is expressed in such a way at this plane of existen=\r\nce ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bottomline is Sense-experience is not different from Anan=\r\nda, and Physical body not different from Chit.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; high level of ability to manipulate objects in the field of du=\r\nality,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cannot compete with perfect self-control=\r\n and egolessness. The&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;hi=\r\nghest shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This question w=\r\nas asked because you were trying to compare apples with oranges, by saying =\r\nthat (egolessness) soul consciousness competes with ego consciousness, pres=\r\numing that they act upon each other.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Truth of the=\r\n matter is that Soul is not in competition with ego consciousness ever, bec=\r\nause God\n is never in competition with his creation !! If a liberated soul =\r\nwants to take part in an ego competition (Yada Yada hee Dharmasya), it has =\r\nto have an ego, however high, like that of an avatar. Krishna took the whee=\r\nl of the chariot and tried to kill Bhishma, not without an ego. Other peopl=\r\ne may differ with me on this.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I see inconsis=\r\ntencies in your views and a biased and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; OTOH, I see a lot of co=\r\nnsistency in this mail exchange than the last time. It is understandable th=\r\nat my view wouldn&#39;t be consistent in every mind-set, because at times, it i=\r\ns not possible to write every little detail for the sake of consistency.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But the happiness one gets when one achieves s=\r\nomething in the field &gt; of duality is not permanent.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The highest shakti gives the highest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-=\r\nananda,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; which is permanent.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n Au=\r\nrobindo Ghosh has clearly stated:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;...If the immo=\r\nrtal and infinite spirit has veiled itself in Matter and is emerging, the d=\r\nevelopment of a liberated Supramental being who shall impose in Mind, Life =\r\nand Matter a higher law than that of limitation and Division, is the inevit=\r\nable conclusion from the nature of the cosmic existence. There is no reason=\r\n why such a being should not liberate and make Divine the physical existenc=\r\ne as well as the Mind and Life....&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; So, lets atte=\r\nmpt to divinze Physical form, in accordance with highest ideal of Aurobindo=\r\n, like the Mahaavatar babaji has done, because its basis is Sat-Chid-Ananad=\r\na. And we need to learn about all the achievements made by all those we can=\r\n know of, irrespective of their being recognized as good or bad by a limite=\r\nd set of people, for a limited duration of time.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nThese are just a few of my views based on what I have read so\n far, because=\r\n I don&#39;t see any reason, why an afterlife would bring me greater truth than=\r\n where I am now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Aryama&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.com/mc/=\r\ncompose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank=\r\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com&lt;/A&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Namaste Sir,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You say that &quot;Kil=\r\nling Ravana was not a great deed&quot; and yet look at &quot;binding the physical bod=\r\ny of both Ram and Lakshman&quot; as a &quot;great deed&quot;. I see inconsistencies in you=\r\nr views and a biased and sympathetic attitutde towards Ravana and his kin. =\r\nAnyway, I will just make a couple of specific points on shakti, which is a =\r\nsubtle topic and not easy to understand.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; On a mundane level, Shakti is Memory.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; If memory is extended the longest, the most fundamental and first me=\r\nmory should say that one is Brahman. If one&#39;s memory extends that far, that=\r\n creates the highest Shakti! In other words, self-realization brings the hi=\r\nghest shakti.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What does the &quot;highe=\r\nst shakti&quot; do ? Compete with lower shakti ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Great question!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Any lower shakti i=\r\ns an ability to perform actions with objects in the field of duality. Why d=\r\noes one perform actions and manipulate the objects in the field of duality?=\r\n Because one is pursuing happiness of some kind or the other. But the happi=\r\nness one gets when one achieves something in the field of duality is not pe=\r\nrmanent.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The highest shakti gives the h=\r\nighest bliss, i.e. sat-chid-ananda, which is permanent.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; When one is pursuing an individual\n will, one may be swimm=\r\ning with or against the divine will. One will have some successes and some =\r\nfailures, some pleasures and some pains. When one&#39;s individual will has dro=\r\npped off and one is flowing with the rhythm of the divine will, one is in b=\r\nliss no matter what one does. One *can* do anything, but one does only what=\r\n divine rhythm wills done by one!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Only =\r\nthe fully detached Shiva can beget Shakti in totality and demons like Ravan=\r\na or Mahisha or Shumbha can only get some trappings of Shakti but can never=\r\n beget Shakti in totality.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; A demon like=\r\n Hiranyakashipu or Ravana may kill or imprison a self-realized rishi. It ma=\r\ny seem like the demon has more shakti. But the rishi is in bliss whether he=\r\n is alive or being killed, whether he is at his hermitage or in prison. The=\r\n happiness demons got from their successes were short-lived and ended later=\r\n. But the rishi was in constant bliss. So the\n rishi&#39;s shakti was superior.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Why then fight like mortals, taki=\r\nng help from mortal allies ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Instead, just order Rud=\r\nra to finish the life of all ones&#39; enemies ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; This is the thing with shakti. Shakti is the ability to do things in =\r\nthe field of duality. Just as you do not give important work to irresponsib=\r\nle people, any level of shakti never goes to people who do not know how to =\r\nhandle that level of shakti.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, if a =\r\nrishi wanted, he could&#39;ve summoned Rudra to finish off Ravana or Hiranyakas=\r\nhipu. But, a rishi is in bliss no matter what and does not break divine rhy=\r\nthm. If Sita, Rama and Hanuman have to come to earth and establish certain =\r\nlessons for future and take care of Ravana, a rishi will let that happen an=\r\nd not do anything hasty.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; ----------------------------=\r\n------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; rit=\r\nual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www=\r\n.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://=\r\nSaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow tar=\r\nget=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- silentadmirer_in\n &lt;silentadmirer_in@&gt; =\r\nwrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskar,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Lord Rama defeated and killed Ravana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Killing Ravana was not a great deed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ravana had do=\r\nne that 10 times himself, beheading his own head, but the shakti of his sad=\r\nhana was such that he got a new head every time to continue the sadhana. On=\r\n a deeper level, it is Rudra that finally effects the death of Physical con=\r\nsciousness, so even that part is not in the hands of a mortal Physical form=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you still put Ravan=\r\na above Rama in shakti, I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question your underst=\r\nanding of what &quot;shakti&quot; is.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On a mundane level, Shak=\r\nti is Memory. Hanumaan realized his shakti only after he was reminded of it=\r\n. Karna, in the final battle, forgot his Shastra vidya because of the curse=\r\n of his Guru. Generalizing, Shakti is the\n ability to remember the series o=\r\nf actions to be done to effect a cause lawfully, irrespective of the doer. =\r\nThus, Hanumaan had perfect memory by birth, and not by the association with=\r\n Rama. Ravana didn&#39;t have perfect memory, else he would have attempted to k=\r\nill Vibhishana sooner than later.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; The use of shakti against avatar, binding the physical body of both Ra=\r\nm and Lakshman, by a mortal (Meghnaad) was a great deed, because even the m=\r\notherly love of Yashoda couldn&#39;t bind Krishna avatar by a rope. Meghnaad wa=\r\ns son of Ravana. If it were not for Hanumaan, and Garuda using divine power=\r\ns, the result would have been different.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Despite all, without Vibhishana revealing the secrets, it was i=\r\nmpossible to kill Ravana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Even a high level of understanding of the field of duality and even &gt; =\r\na&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
