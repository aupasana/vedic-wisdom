Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Namaste friends,\n&gt;  \n&gt; You ask a very good question.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Agni is the ele=\r\nment of transformation. It symbolizes absorbing and \ndigesting experiences.=\r\n As you make offerings in fire and they burn in \nfire, various spiritual ex=\r\nperiences are processed and digested by \nyour internal fire.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Tongue i=\r\ns that which allows one to taste things that one is going \nto accept inside=\r\n and digest. Each tongue of fire stands for a spirit \nthat controls how you=\r\n absorb spiritual experiences.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The seven to=\r\nngues of Agni are: Kaali, Karaali, Manojava, Sulohita, \nSudhoomra-Varna, Sp=\r\nhulingini, and Vishwaruchi.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Kaali is the dark and black/blue fire. It=\r\n symbolizes the spirit of \ndetachment. Spirit of detachment controls how yo=\r\nu absorb your \nexperiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; Karaali is the monstrous, dreadful fire that looks like a wide open \nm=\r\nouth. Spirit of attachment and desire controls how you absorb your \nexperie=\r\nnces, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Manojava is the s=\r\nwiftly moving, flickering and unstable flame. \nSpirit of wavering (could al=\r\nso be flexibility) controls how you \nabsorb your experiences, when you are =\r\noffering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Sulohita is the (copper like) dark r=\r\ned color flame. Spirit of \ndetermination and strength controls how you abso=\r\nrb your experiences, \nwhen you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;  \n&gt; S=\r\nudhoomra-Varna is the greyish/purple/smoke-colored fire. Spirit of \nconfusi=\r\non (could also be resolution of confusion) controls how you \nabsorb your ex=\r\nperiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Sphulingini =\r\nis the fire with sparks. Spirit of aggression and haste \n(could also be a g=\r\nreat intuition/insight) controls how you absorb \nyour experiences, when you=\r\n are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Vishwaruchi is the bright fire.=\r\n Spirit of focus, knowing, being and \nbliss controls how you absorb your ex=\r\nperiences, when you are offering \nin that tongue of fire.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        * =\r\n       *\n&gt;  \n&gt; As you keep performing homam and a relationship is formed be=\r\ntween \nyou and fire, the external fire in the homa kundam will reflect your=\r\n \ninternal fire. When your mind is well-focused and blissful, the fire \nwil=\r\nl automatically burn bright.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The state of your mind will decide how y=\r\nou will taste the spiritual \nexperiences you are going to absorb from aroun=\r\nd you. That in turn \ndecides which tongues (tasting agents) of your interna=\r\nl fire are \nreceiving food right now. That in turn decides which tongues of=\r\n the \nexternal fire are receiving offerings right now.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The external f=\r\nire is a mirror to your internal state. An adept may \nbe able to detect, lo=\r\noking at the fire, which tongues of fire are \nactive right now and hence gu=\r\ness the state your mind is in.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, t=\r\nrying to pay too much attention to this technicality \nand becoming over-con=\r\nscious of the nature of fire is unneeded. Though \nexternal can be used to m=\r\nanipulate the internal (within some limits), \nit can become a distraction.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; Whether internal follows external or external follows internal a \ninv=\r\nalid question. The reality is that the two change together. \nNeither is the=\r\n cause and neither is the effect. They just happen \ntogether.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Without=\r\n thinkiing much, just make offerings in the fire with the \n*firm belief* th=\r\nat god is in fire. The rest will happen \nautomatically. It may take time, b=\r\nut it will happen by itself.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Y=\r\nourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.hom=\r\ne.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; --=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt;  \n&gt; ---=\r\n-- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 11, 2009 8:13 AM\n&gt; S=\r\nubject: [vedic-wisdom] Agni\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What do the seven &quot;ton=\r\ngues&quot; of Agni mean?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
