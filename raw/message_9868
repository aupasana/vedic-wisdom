Which means if one has lived a life where there never was\n&gt; any opportunity for the soul to come forth and shine, in later birth it\n&gt; cannot be recalled. For death is a complete process. Body, mind, life all\n&gt; get dissolved and new set is generated based on need.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Buddhists do not believe in the existence of a soul. They believe in\n&gt; Shunya - which is similar to our idea of Atmah. Therefore their idea of\n&gt; reincarnation is very different. It is like an energy stream made up of\n&gt; mind, body that coalesces together to give the impression of an individual\n&gt; being, which upon death get disintegrated and and spread into the greater\n&gt; flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into another formation at\n&gt; a later date, and some other parts can simultaneous or at a different point\n&gt; can coalesce into a different part.   Hence it is possible for a Lama, in\n&gt; their doctrine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of his energy\n&gt; reincarnate into one body while another part of his energy reincarnate into\n&gt; another body *simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech\n&gt; incarnating in one person, while his energy of mind incarnating in another\n&gt; person, or his energy of body incarnating in another person and all these\n&gt; happening simultaneously! It fits with their philosophy.\n&gt;\n&gt; Those philosophies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked\n&gt; at the Universe only as a constant flow of energy governed only by a\n&gt; supreme law of debts/balances - rna. Hence rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are\n&gt; replete with this term. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the\n&gt; illusion of life and move into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There\n&gt; is nothing here that is of any final importance. Hence the tendency towards\n&gt; strict and formal renunciation of life and its processes.\n&gt;\n&gt; But the old Vedantic idea was different. There was a soul - that is not\n&gt; dissolved at death unlike body/mind etc - but carried forward from one life\n&gt; to another and the chief aim of human evolution was to assist and develop\n&gt; this soul&#39;s influence on the earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human\n&gt; mind/body vehicle for this purpose. The great idea was that this individual\n&gt; and unique soul - for no two souls are exactly same - in some birth\n&gt; finally, be able to *consciously* operate on an individual human vehicle\n&gt; and enjoy a Divine Life.  A Supreme Negation of life is not the ultimate\n&gt; aim, it is only one among many possibilities.  If  moving into a state of\n&gt; complete negation/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim, then\n&gt; there was just no need for Avataras to descend and perform complex\n&gt; life-actions. The law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to\n&gt; only an idea of give and take of energy as in the case of the idea of\n&gt; rnabandhana. The important thing is whether an action is helping the soul\n&gt; to unfurl and come forth to the surface. If it does, then it changes the\n&gt; karmic equations immediately. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and\n&gt; real-time algorithm. That is why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed\n&gt; hundreds of people can transform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not\n&gt; have to actually get born a hundred times to get killed in the hands of\n&gt; those he had killed]. Whereas those aspects of life where the soul has no\n&gt; play or no scope of play, are firmly governed by the law of rnabandhanas -\n&gt; a mechanical give and take of energy.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now since the soul is what remembers and everything else being perishable,\n&gt; the only indestructible link between past life and present life, it is only\n&gt; the soul-moments which will be recalled, and never a complete cinematic\n&gt; biography recollection. That is fantasizing. Now if there have been lives\n&gt; when the soul had little or no frontal role to play at all, then those are\n&gt; dead and gone and buried six feet under with no trace. For Nature, those\n&gt; lives serve no purpose at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; Moreover all these are possible ONLY if and when an individual starts\n&gt; living in and through the soul in a very very strong manner. That is not\n&gt; easy.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *\n&gt; I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal,\n&gt; / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through\n&gt; them all. -Sri Aurobindo\n&gt; *\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   On Saturday, 26 October 2013 7:38 AM, Narasimha P.V.R.

However, if such memory does not\n&gt; come at a very young age due to some deep desires from past life or an\n&gt; unnatural death before, it is not easy to get it later. Even for a great\n&gt; yogi with tremendous self-control, calming the mind down to suppress\n&gt; current conditioning sufficiently to remember past life is not easy.\n&gt;\n&gt; For example, at least 3 saints/yogis of a high spiritual caliber claimed\n&gt; to be re-incarnations of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. If such saints cannot\n&gt; accurately know their own past life, anybody thinking that someone else can\n&gt; make one aware of one&#39;s past life is just kidding oneself.\n&gt;\n&gt; Remembering past life or making someone else do so, is not at all easy. In\n&gt; comparison, hallucinating that one remembered past life or making someone\n&gt; else hallucinate that one remembered past life, is certainly very easy! In\n&gt; fact, I suspect that is what happens in most past life regressions..\n&gt;\n&gt; There is a deep reason why Nature has built this mechanism of forgetting a\n&gt; life when another life starts. Otherwise, this game will end very\n&gt; quickly. This forgetfulness prolongs the game very much and makes it far\n&gt; more interesting.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; --------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;   ------------------------------\n&gt;  *From:* Phil Stinnet &lt;philstinnet@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; *Sent:* Friday, October 25, 2013 9:16 PM\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: RE: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from\n&gt; spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Did you get your PLR (Past Life Regression)?

I found a very mature and realistic\n&gt; treatment of ghosts, paranormal beings and black magic.\n&gt;\n&gt; http://www.veda.harekrsna.cz/encyclopedia/ghosts_FAQ.htm\n&gt;\n&gt; The summary of the FAQ is:\n&gt;\n&gt;   - There are number of mantra&#39;s suggested. One of them is the Nursimha\n&gt; beeja mantra\n&gt;       om hrim kshraum ugram viram Maha-Vishnum jvalantam sarvatho mukham\n&gt;       Nrisimham bhishanam bhadram mrityu-mrityum namamy aham\n&gt;   - Playing Bhagvatgita in Sanskrit, keeping a Bhagvat Gita book in room\n&gt; helps\n&gt;   - Doing some punya karya - e.g. chant Bhagvat Gita and donate the result\n&gt; to the ghost, so that it has enough punya to move on. This should be\n&gt; preferably done by the immediate family members.\n&gt;\n&gt; It also suggests contacting the following for help. The extract from the\n&gt; FAQ is: &quot;There&#39;re many types of exorcism. It&#39;s officially performed e.g.\n&gt; by Roman-Catholic Church. It&#39;s also done in Orthodox Church. The simplest\n&gt; Catholic exorcism is a so-called release/liberation prayer which helps in\n&gt; easier cases. Every priest knows it. When it fails, a professional exorcist\n&gt; has to be approached. Catholic exorcists are experienced and provide their\n&gt; services free of charge. Every diocese has one and a local priest should be\n&gt; able to provide contact.&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; On a personal note, my maternal grandmother was very attached to my mom\n&gt; and me.

Hanuman, Bhairava,\n&gt; Chandi, Narasimha - so many deities can be worshipped for this purpose.\n&gt; However, fixing it after it reaches a crisis point requires someone who has\n&gt; enough shakti and knows how to direct it.\n&gt;\n&gt; Some replies referred to saints/swamis who are very pure/elevated etc.\n&gt; Even if one is pure or elevated, one may not necessarily be able to help.\n&gt; This really requires some shakti and the ability to direct it for this\n&gt; specific task.\n&gt;\n&gt; Though I live in the area, I am not capable of doing anything personally.\n&gt; However, if anybody in troubles like this is interested and visits me, I\n&gt; can give some ash from my daily homam of divine Mother.

I am sure there too one can find\n&gt; good exorcists, maybe not of our religion.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have very little knowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact\n&gt; unfortunately have never ever tried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, there is a particular mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considered\n&gt; to be of excellent potency for these kind of problems. This form of\n&gt; Bhairava is a small child, known as Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures\n&gt; He is also referred to as the one whose mother is Sahashra Chandika.\n&gt; References to this form can be found in the Rudrayamala, at least some\n&gt; versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava has been invoked for\n&gt; centuries by followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions for protection against\n&gt; spirits, and specially during rituals of cremation ground.\n&gt;\n&gt; The standard mantra is (there are many variations of this mantra too, all\n&gt; are good):\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Generally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in one sitting.\n&gt; And this should be continued daily till such time that there is some\n&gt; visible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine\n&gt; instance of spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite\n&gt; impossible to rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These days\n&gt; almost no one has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession\n&gt; from a distance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a must for the\n&gt; one trying to help. So close family members, who live with the girl will\n&gt; have to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by\n&gt; Narasimha, you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I\n&gt; guess being in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.\n&gt;\n&gt; If the family visits India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if\n&gt; possible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka\n&gt; Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest stating\n&gt; the problem. Around these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of\n&gt; Bhairava live who are adepts in removing any kind of negative influence.\n&gt; They may charge a certain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents and\n&gt; the girl to come with some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside\n&gt; the temple and then perform their rituals. Many I know have actually\n&gt; benefited. This is one method. I am sure their maybe other methods too. I\n&gt; just wrote what came to my mind.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hope this helps.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; **\n&gt; *I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit\n&gt; ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a\n&gt; hunter through them all. -Sri Aurobindo*\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;   ------------------------------\n&gt;  *From:* &quot;b_jamnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; *Sent:* Saturday, 10 August 2013 6:36 PM\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at\n&gt; nighttime)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Namaste.

For there are various classes and kinds and types of entities which\n&gt; can possess an individual and some of them can be downright nasty.\n&gt;\n&gt; Upayas are many. As so many different people have advised, these all\n&gt; sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, but whether any one of them will\n&gt; actually work in a specific case or not depends on multiple factors.\n&gt; Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It all depends on what kind\n&gt; of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individual and what their link for\n&gt; the same is. By link it means one has to find out the root, or source of\n&gt; exactly what action allowed them to enter into the person. Sometimes it can\n&gt; be something as simple as spitting somewhere (where this being(s) reside),\n&gt; or causally entering into their territory and being susceptible to such\n&gt; possession by certain weakness in the mind and body, or in some cases where\n&gt; such entities are deliberately send to cause harm to an individual, ETC\n&gt; ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one stop method of\n&gt; removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on the shakti of the\n&gt; spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help are able to\n&gt; generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit of a violent\n&gt; and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person trying to remove it\n&gt; is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.\n&gt;\n&gt; These things like removing possession are specializations. These do not\n&gt; fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is\n&gt; getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to\n&gt; stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how to\n&gt; handle the same too. Again if a spirit is removed by force before the time\n&gt; till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of\n&gt; the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve\n&gt; some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the\n&gt; spirit. It is all a complex chain.\n&gt;\n&gt; [Reminds me of a particular individual I knew some years ago who was an\n&gt; expert in exorcism. But before starting any exorcism he would ask his\n&gt; Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the time frame for which the\n&gt; spirit would stay in possession as per the previous karmic link between the\n&gt; spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the\n&gt; spirit to leave the body of its own free will, promising good deeds for the\n&gt; spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would\n&gt; work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to\n&gt; be applied.]\n&gt;\n&gt; Best thing to do is a) find someone who knows exactly how to deal with\n&gt; spirit possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not\n&gt; possible, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity -\n&gt; preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC\n&gt; (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force\n&gt; and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may\n&gt; not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone may have to spend\n&gt; 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental\n&gt; belief/faith/will/determination to see this through to the very end. While\n&gt; doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either\n&gt; make the possessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her.\n&gt; And pray as hard as possible.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best of luck and may God help the family.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; **\n&gt; *I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit\n&gt; ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a\n&gt; hunter through them all. -Sri Aurobindo*\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;   ------------------------------\n&gt;  *From:* Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; *Sent:* Saturday, 10 August 2013 8:17 AM\n&gt; *Subject:* Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at\n&gt; nighttime)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you Nithin, I will convey this to the parents.

I had trouble\n&gt; falling asleep, because I could hear strange noises - creaking and\n&gt; something moving in the attic. I&#39;m very sensitive to different energies - I\n&gt; don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether something divine or rather evil is\n&gt; present in a certain place. That place didn&#39;t feel good to me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and every night I would make up because\n&gt; of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I could see them but once I\n&gt; started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I would wake up in a\n&gt; terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could definitely hear some\n&gt; steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight to see nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysis to me - I instantly become fully\n&gt; aware and I can move my body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Can it be that spirits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There\n&gt; were a few more people staying at that place and everybody had severe\n&gt; problems with sleep, so it&#39;s not just me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at that place before going to\n&gt; sleep and this was the only night I was able to sleep properly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that place I started waking up at home,\n&gt; feeling some strong presence - usually some short beings (up to 50 cm in\n&gt; height, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); Once the sun rises, all of the\n&gt; strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will protect me from all kinds of astral\n&gt; beings at night? Something that I can chant before going to sleep. This has\n&gt; been bothering me for some time now and it interferes with my life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;Thank you in advance!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\r\n--047d7b343ef27eeb3604e9d00699\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Dear Rajarshi,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;,&#39;new york&#39;,times,serif;=\r\nfont-size:16px&quot;&gt;&gt; Reincarnation is of the soul, and the soul will recall=\r\n ...=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:&#39;times new roman&=\r\n#39;,&#39;new york&#39;,times,serif;font-size:16px&quot;&gt;&gt; death is a complet=\r\ne process.=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:&#39;times new ro=\r\nman&#39;,&#39;new york&#39;,times,serif;font-size:16px&quot;&gt;&gt; Body, mind, li=\r\nfe all get dissolved and new set is generated based on need.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_extra&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;=\r\nltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If the body and mind get dissolved upon death, the=\r\nn where does karma attach?

Reincarnation is of the soul, and the so=\r\nul will recall those specific moments from past lives when the soul had a r=\r\nole to play on the external consciousness. Which means if one has lived a l=\r\nife where there never was any opportunity for the soul to come forth and sh=\r\nine, in later birth it cannot be recalled. For death is a complete process.=\r\n Body, mind, life all get dissolved and new set is generated based on need.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The Buddhists do not believe in the existence of a soul. They bel=\r\nieve in Shunya - which is similar to our idea of Atmah. Therefore their ide=\r\na of reincarnation is very different. It is like an energy stream made up o=\r\nf mind, body that coalesces together\n to give the impression of an individu=\r\nal being, which upon death get disintegrated and and spread into the greate=\r\nr flow of energy. Now part(s) of these can coalesce into another formation =\r\nat a later date, and some other parts can simultaneous or at a different po=\r\nint can coalesce into a different part. =A0 Hence it is possible for a Lama=\r\n, in their doctrine of reincarnation, to have the some parts of his energy =\r\nreincarnate into one body while another part of his energy reincarnate into=\r\n another body *simultaneously*. Like a Lama may have his energy of speech i=\r\nncarnating in one person, while his energy of mind incarnating in another p=\r\nerson, or his energy of body incarnating in another person and all these ha=\r\nppening simultaneously! It fits with their philosophy.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Those philo=\r\nsophies which believed in this kind of a reincarnation looked at the Univer=\r\nse only as a constant flow of energy governed only by a supreme law of debt=\r\ns/balances - rna. Hence\n rnabandhana. Jain scriptures are replete with this=\r\n term. The final aim of all this is to get rid of the illusion of life and =\r\nmove into a Supreme Negation - Shunya/Nirvana. There is nothing here that i=\r\ns of any final importance. Hence the tendency towards strict and formal ren=\r\nunciation of life and its processes.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;But the old Vedantic idea was=\r\n different. There was a soul - that is not dissolved at death unlike body/m=\r\nind etc - but carried forward from one life to another and the chief aim of=\r\n human evolution was to assist and develop this soul&#39;s influence on the=\r\n earth. The soul inhabits and uses a human mind/body vehicle for this purpo=\r\nse. The great idea was that this individual and unique soul - for no two so=\r\nuls are exactly same - in some birth finally, be able to *consciously* oper=\r\nate on an individual human vehicle and enjoy a Divine Life.=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;=\r\n&lt;span&gt; A Supreme Negation of life is \nnot the ultimate aim, it is only one =\r\namong many possibilities.=A0 If=A0 moving into a state \nof complete negatio=\r\nn/Shunya/Other-world is the final and inevitable aim,\n then there was just =\r\nno need for Avataras to descend and perform complex\n life-actions. &lt;/span&gt;T=\r\nhe law of Karma is here too, but it is not restricted to only an idea of gi=\r\nve and take of energy as in the case of the idea of rnabandhana. The import=\r\nant thing is whether an action is helping the soul to unfurl and come forth=\r\n to the surface. If it does, then it changes the karmic equations immediate=\r\nly. Nature is a massive, complex, unfailing and real-time algorithm. That i=\r\ns why a Ratnakara -a bandit who must have killed hundreds of people can tra=\r\nnsform himself into a Rishi Valmiki [ he did not have to actually get born =\r\na hundred times to get killed in the hands of those he had killed]. &lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;span&gt;Whereas those aspects of life \nwhere the soul has no play or no scope=\r\n of play, are firmly governed by \nthe law of rnabandhanas - a mechanical gi=\r\nve and take of energy. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-style:normal;font-si=\r\nze:16px;background-color:transparent;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;,=\r\n&#39;new york&#39;,times,serif&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-style:normal;font-size:16px;background-color:transparent;font-family:&#39;=\r\ntimes new roman&#39;,&#39;new york&#39;,times,serif&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Now since the so=\r\nul is what remembers and everything else being perishable, the only indestr=\r\nuctible link between past life and present life, it is only the soul-moment=\r\ns which will be recalled, and never a complete cinematic biography recollec=\r\ntion. That is fantasizing. Now if there have been lives when the soul had l=\r\nittle or no frontal role to play at all, then those are dead and gone and b=\r\nuried six feet under with no trace.

I am sure there too one can fin=\r\nd good exorcists, maybe not of our religion. &lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;br clear=\r\n=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;I have very little knowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact u=\r\nnfortunately have never ever tried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.&lt;=\r\nbr clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;However, there is a particular mantra =\r\nof Lord Bhairava which is considered to be of excellent potency for these k=\r\nind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, known as Vatuka. A=\r\ns per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as the one whose mothe=\r\nr is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be found in the Rudraya=\r\nmala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhairava has be=\r\nen invoked for centuries\n by\n followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions for prot=\r\nection against spirits, and specially during rituals\n of cremation ground. =\r\n&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;The standard mantra is (there are man=\r\ny variations of this mantra too, all are good):&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:n=\r\normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru Vat=\r\nukaay Hreem Om&quot;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana,sans-ser=\r\nif&quot;&gt;Generally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in one sitti=\r\nng. And this should be continued daily till such time that there is some vi=\r\nsible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine instance=\r\n of spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite impossible =\r\nto rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These days almost no on=\r\ne has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession from a dist=\r\nance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a must for\n the one tryin=\r\ng to help.=A0So close family members, who live with the girl\n will\n have to=\r\n do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, =\r\nyou will find methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess being in=\r\n a foreign land homas may not be that easy.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;=\r\nnone&quot;&gt;\n\nIf the family visits India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask th=\r\nem, if possible, to visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or V=\r\natuka Bhairava temple. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest stat=\r\ning the problem. Around these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas=\r\n of Bhairava live who are adepts in removing any kind of negative influence=\r\n. They may charge a certain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents and=\r\n the girl to come with some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi insid=\r\ne the temple and then perform their rituals. Many I know have actually bene=\r\nfited. This is one method. I am sure their \n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
