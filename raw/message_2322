Each\nreligion, as it wer=\r\ne, takes up one part of the great universal truth, and\nspends its whole for=\r\nce in embodying and typifying that part of the great\ntruth. It is, therefor=\r\ne, addition; not exclusion.\n\nThen, again, we also know that there may be al=\r\nmost contradictory points of\nview of the same thing, but they will all indi=\r\ncate the same thing.Suppose a\nman is journeying towards the sun, and as he =\r\nadvances he takes a photograph\nof the sun at every stage. When he comes bac=\r\nk, he has many photographs of\nthe sun, which he places before us. We see th=\r\nat not two are alike, and yet,\nwho will deny that all these are photographs=\r\n of the same sun, from different\nstandpoints?Take four photographs of this =\r\nchurch from different corners: how\ndifferent they would look, and yet they =\r\nwould all represent this church. In\nthe same way, we are all looking at tru=\r\nth from different standpoints, which\nvary according to our birth, education=\r\n, surroundings, and so on.We are\nviewing truth, getting as much of it as th=\r\nese circumstances will permit,\ncolouring the truth with our own heart, unde=\r\nrstanding it with our own\nintellect, and grasping it with our own mind. We =\r\ncan only know as much of\ntruth as is related to us, as much of it as we are=\r\n able to receive. This\nmakes the difference between man and man, and occasi=\r\nons sometimes even\ncontradictory ideas; yet we all belong to the same great=\r\n universal truth.\n\nIn this line the Mohammedans were the best off; every st=\r\nep forward was made\nwith the sword =97 the Koran in the one hand and the sw=\r\nord in the other: &quot;Take\nthe Koran, or you must die; there is no alternative=\r\n! &quot; You know from history\nhow phenomenal was their success; for six hundred=\r\n years nothing could resist\nthem, and then there came a time when they had =\r\nto cry halt. So will it be\nwith other religions if they follow the same met=\r\nhods.\n\nThe fact that all these old religions are living today proves that t=\r\nhey must\nhave kept that mission intact; in spite of all their mistakes, in =\r\nspite of\nall difficulties, in spite of all quarrels, in spite of all the in=\r\ncrustation\nof forms and figures, the heart of every one of them is sound =\r\n=97 it is a\nthrobbing, beating, living heart. They have not lost, any one o=\r\nf them, the\ngreat mission they came for. And it is splendid to study that m=\r\nission. Take\nMohammedanism, for instance. Christian people hate no religion=\r\n in the world\nso much as Mohammedanism. They think it is the very worst for=\r\nm of religion\nthat ever existed. As soon as a man becomes a Mohammedan, the=\r\n whole of Islam\nreceives him as a brother with open arms, without making an=\r\ny distinction,\nwhich no other religion does. If one of your American Indian=\r\ns becomes a\nMohammedan, the Sultan of Turkey would have no objection to din=\r\ne with him.\n\nIf he has brains, no position is barred to him. In this countr=\r\ny, I have\nnever yet seen a church where the white man and the negro can kne=\r\nel side by\nside to pray. Just think of that: Islam makes its followers all =\r\nequal =97 so,\nthat, you see, is the peculiar excellence of Mohammedanism. I=\r\nn many places\nin the Koran you find very sensual ideas of life. Never mind.=\r\nWhat\nMohammedanism comes to preach to the world is this practical brotherho=\r\nod of\nall belonging to their faith. That is the essential part of the Moham=\r\nmedan\nreligion; and all the other ideas about heaven and of life etc.. are =\r\nnot\nMohammedanism. They are accretions.\n\nWith the Hindus you will find one =\r\nnational idea =97 spirituality. In no other\nreligion, in no other sacred bo=\r\noks of the world, will you find so much\nenergy spent in defining the idea o=\r\nf God. They tried to define the ideal of\nsoul so that no earthly touch migh=\r\nt mar it. The spirit must be divine; and\nspirit understood as spirit must n=\r\not be made into a man. The same idea of\nunity, of the realisation of God, t=\r\nhe omnipresent, is preached throughout.\nThey think it is all nonsense to sa=\r\ny that He lives in heaven, and all that.\nIt is a mere human, anthropomorphi=\r\nc idea. All the heaven that ever existed\nis now and here. One moment in inf=\r\ninite time is quite as good as any other\nmoment.\n\nWith the Christians, the =\r\ncentral idea that has been preached by them is the\nsame: &quot;Watch and pray, f=\r\nor the kingdom of Heaven is at hand&quot; =97 which means,\npurify your minds and=\r\n be ready!And that spirit never dies. You recollect\nthat the Christians are=\r\n, even in the darkest days, even in the most\nsuperstitious Christian countr=\r\nies, always trying to prepare themselves for\nthe coming of the Lord, by try=\r\ning to help others, building hospitals, and so\non. So long as the Christian=\r\ns keep to that ideal, their religion lives.\n\nSource:\nhttp://en.wikisource.o=\r\nrg/wiki/The_Complete_Works_of_Swami_Vivekananda/Volume_2/Practical_Vedanta_=\r\nand_other_lectures/The_Way_to_the_Realisation_of_a_Universal_Religion\n\n-- \n=\r\nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--00c09ffb59752393fa0471ca5170\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana;color:rgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;THE WAY TO THE REALISATION OF A=\r\n UNIVERSAL RELIGION&lt;br&gt;(Delivered in the Universalist Church, Pasadena, Cal=\r\nifornia, 28th January 1900)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bo=\r\nld&quot;&gt;Do religions contradict or supplement each other? =97 that is the quest=\r\nion.I believe that they are not contradictory; they are supplementary.
