He is living in different times and the Mother&#39;s =\r\nplans for him, his mutt and his country may be different now.\n \nIt is not g=\r\nood to think negatively about a liberated sage. Please note that the curren=\r\nt pontiff belongs to a lineage starting from Adi Sankara and that he was pi=\r\ncked and guided by Swami Chandrasekhara Saraswati.
