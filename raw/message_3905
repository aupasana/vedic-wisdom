One night, Swami Sathasivom (the h=\r\nead priest of Kalikambal temple in Chennai where Shata Chandi homam was don=\r\ne, which started the homam movement), Narayan Iyer (member of this list) an=\r\nd I were going in a car from my house to a priest&#39;s house in this area. At =\r\nthe time, Narayan was smoking about 10 cigarettes a day.\n \nAnna (we lovingl=\r\ny call Swami Sathasivom &quot;Anna&quot;, meaning elder brother) asked Narayan, &quot;didn=\r\n&#39;t guruji (he lovingly calls me guruji) ask you to stop smoking?&quot; I answere=\r\nd no. I added, &quot;but anna, I once considered asking Narayan to stop smoking =\r\nas guru dakshina. But I thought I would ask for something bigger and more i=\r\nmportant. So I did not ask.&quot;\n \nNarayan did not say anything. But, when he r=\r\neached home that night, he threw away all the cigaretta boxes he had at hom=\r\ne. This was in late 2005 or in 2006 (I forget). He has not smoked since the=\r\nn. Just knowing that I considered asking him to stop smoking was enough for=\r\n him!\n \nOf course, not everyone will have that kind of mental strength. It =\r\nis not easy to give up habits in a jiffy.\n \nBeing able to give up cigarette=\r\ns, alcohol etc is useful.

If priest was aware and still did that, then I can\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; understand the consequence.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one goes in the path of a torna=\r\ndo, aware or unaware that a tornado is coming, one will still be consumed b=\r\ny it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If the question is of fairness, well, is it fair that tornad=\r\noes, earthquakes, hurricanes etc should kill thousands of people every year=\r\n? Well, Natural order of the universe is neither fair nor unfair. It is jus=\r\nt an &quot;order&quot;. Your actions gets opposite reactions. You experience the frui=\r\nts of your actions, as determined by the order of nature. A person may happ=\r\nen to be doing what he sees as his dharma and earthquake may strike there a=\r\nnd kill him. If so, there must be a previous karma as a result of which he =\r\nis placed there at that time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the case of the priest in the sto=\r\nry, his mistake is that he slapped a person worshipping god. If he had no w=\r\nay of assessing the bhava (feeling) in the mind of the person doing the wor=\r\nship, he should&#39;ve given the benefit of doubt and assumed it was a sincere =\r\ndevotee, rather than assuming it was a fool.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; See, when Ramakrishna=\r\n went there and saw Trilinga Swami, he immediately knew the stature and rem=\r\narked that this is Viswanatha himself. However, others may not be so fortun=\r\nate. You only saw a body with some body parts and some clothes and nothing =\r\nbeyond it. If so, give the benefit of doubt and treat kindly and respectful=\r\nly. Just because of external parameters, do not judge a person and act hars=\r\nh.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hitting a person who still has a limited self-identification is=\r\n one thing and hitting a person who has no limited self-identification and =\r\nidentifies with the entire universe or with a deity is different.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n* * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In any case, do not worry about that priest that much. For a=\r\nll you know, he may be an associate of Shiva who came along with Trilinga S=\r\nwami to enact a story and teach a moral and he may have gone back to Shiva.=\r\n Even if not, he was lucky to enact an important role in an interesting div=\r\nine drama.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jeevanmuktas may engage in actions that =\r\nare difficult to comprehend. They have no personal ego, will and agenda. Th=\r\ney become instruments for Nature to fulfil the Natural order. The action of=\r\n Trilinga Swami may help several people question, challenge and overcome th=\r\neir biases and learn some important lessons, centuries after he left earth.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regarding many gods: As I keep emphasizing, yogis =\r\nand saints sometimes give advices based on desa-kaala-paatra or advices gea=\r\nred at a specific set of people.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There is nothing wrong in having =\r\nmany deities in pooja room and worshipping all. Such people may lead fruitf=\r\nul dharmik lives. However, Vimalananda may not be concerned about such peop=\r\nle. His teachings may be addressed at some other people to come in the comi=\r\nng years who he has rina with and who are meant to achieve saayujya of some=\r\n deities and do some work. There is an intended audience for every work and=\r\n no work can be perfect for all audience.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If the goal is either li=\r\nberation or a deity&#39;s darshan (vision) or saayujya (company), one has to ag=\r\nree that focusing on one deity is the best thing to do, rather than trying =\r\nto focus mind on ten deities and keep switching. A deity comes when mind an=\r\nd its thoughts are filled with that deity&#39;s name and mantra and other thoug=\r\nhts are driven away from the mind. Vimalananda perhaps wanted to motivate s=\r\neveral people to strive for vision/company of deities. He probably thought =\r\nsome people he has a rina with would come to earth with such a potential.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thyagaraja did compose songs on many deities. But, h=\r\ne first had a darshan of Rama. He spent several years chanting Rama&#39;s name =\r\nand had a darshan. Then he composed songs on many deities. However, he saw =\r\nall of them as different emanations from Rama. He saw Rama in all.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Same with Aadi Shankara, Muththuswamy Deekshitar, Bammera Pothana and othe=\r\nrs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When one achieves perfection in surrender to one deity, one&#39;s =\r\nlife is made. After that, one will see the same deity in all deities even i=\r\nf he worships 100 deities. If one is switching between ten deities before t=\r\nhat, it may not be helpful in filling the mind with thoughts of any of thos=\r\ne deities. Mind sees those deities as different objects and may not fully s=\r\nurrender to any of them. Still, as I said, one may lead a fruitful dhaarmik=\r\n life. That&#39;s fine.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But, if you really want to taste the nectar of=\r\n complete surrender, it is better to pick one deity and fill the mind with =\r\nhis/her thoughts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Excellent answers on each threa=\r\nd and mother showed her divine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; grace through you that I am able to fi=\r\nnd answers to many\n&gt; &gt; &gt; questions that my immature mind keeps on asking! \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though I had some spiritual experiences fortunately, I am not a re=\r\nalized person.

I do unde=\r\nrstand that Telang Swamy might have been a great yogi but my point is how a=\r\nre we to understand that greatness and in that context what is ununsual in =\r\nthe priest&#39;s reaction that God had to punish him that hard! If priest was a=\r\nware and still did that, then I can understand the consequence. I haven&#39;t y=\r\net the second book though! Probably that will explain. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, =\r\nI understand RamaKrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s famous &#39;Dig at one place 10 feet in=\r\nstead of 1 foot at 10 places if you want to find water&#39;. But contrary to th=\r\nat we find great saints / composers / poets from India have indeed worshipp=\r\ned many forms of the God and were successful in that approach as well. For =\r\ninstance, there is not a single deity form that was not worshipped by Adi S=\r\nankara and/or Muththuswamy Dikshitar. It was famous that Muththuswamy Diksh=\r\nitar was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka and he left his mortal coil by sin=\r\nging to Madurai MeenakshiDevi in the presence of many of his disciples. But=\r\n he composed songs of deep devotion that have immense power and depth on Lo=\r\nrd Shiva, Ganesha, Subramanya, Rama and so on. So was Thyagaraja. So were m=\r\nany great composers of Carnatic Music in that path. In fact they were all g=\r\nreat advaitis and never saw any difference between any form of the God, wha=\r\nt soever. Bammera Pothana, a great poet of Andhra who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; translated Bhag=\r\navatam, in his opening invocatory poems, pays homage to Lord Vishnu, Shiva,=\r\n Brahma, Ganesha, Saraswati, Brahmi, Durga, Lakshmi in that order before de=\r\nclaring that he got the divine inspiration from Lord Rama to write the Stor=\r\nies of Krishna! Where is the difference between any form of God here! I won=\r\nder. So, I was not able to comprehend why Vimalananda accuses many Hindus o=\r\nf having a chaotic mind just because their puja mandirams are filled with m=\r\nany photographs/ idols of different murthis of Almighty.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nagra=\r\nj \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhagaru, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Excellent answers on e=\r\nach thread and mother showed her divine grace through you that I am able to=\r\n find answers to many questions that my immature mind keeps on asking! \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Anyway, coming back to the topic, some of the topics I found dist=\r\nurbing in the first book of Aghora are as follows: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. On the =\r\npage 45 it says that Telang swami performed the ritual bath of Kashi Vishve=\r\nshwara with his own urine and feces. What could be the compelling reason fo=\r\nr this bizarre behavior and why should the priest who slapped him die, beca=\r\nuse in my opinion, anyone else would have done the same in the least! Since=\r\n you have an excellent way to explain many seemingly disturbing things, I h=\r\nope to find and answer here. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. In quite a few places, Vimala=\r\nnanda equates changing the loyalty from diety to diety as akin to prostitut=\r\nion, which I find as an extreme view! If that were true, why would Adi Sank=\r\nara compose so many hymns in praise of so many dieties, Thyagaraja composed=\r\n in the praise of Sri Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaganmata as well. =\r\nSo are so many great composers / poets. The examples of Tulasidas and Leela=\r\nshuka where they wanted to see their favorite deity form only (rama in the =\r\ncase of former and krishna in the case of latter) despite knowing that the =\r\nother form is the same supreme being, are only a very minority in the list =\r\nof Bhaktas that we have? Why this kind of a view. I see myself being equall=\r\ny in the love and awe of every form of god, namely Shiva, rama, krishna, ga=\r\nnesha, amba, subramanya, anjaneya and so on! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nagraj \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 3/2/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [ve=\r\ndic-wisdom] Surrender (Re: Aghora books..)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogro=\r\nups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, March 2, 2010, 6:31 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to achieve it effecti=\r\nvey?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If it can be achieved easily, we will not have so many sp=\r\niritual paths and so many sadhanas.

Look at you=\r\nr belongings (spouse, children, job, house, cars, wealth, name, fame, and e=\r\nven body) as the property of god. Imagine that you are a temporary caretake=\r\nr, just as a servant may be living in a rich person&#39;s house as the caretake=\r\nr as that person stays away. Think of all that is in your hands as the sacr=\r\ned property of your master and take care like a committed servant. A servan=\r\nt takes the best care of his master&#39;s property, but does not get attached. =\r\nDo not be attached anything and yet take the best possible care. If somethi=\r\nng goes wrong, do not worry too much and tell yourself that the master will=\r\n take care of it when he gets a chance to look at it. Think for a moment ho=\r\nw a servant taking care of the properties of a master living away thinks an=\r\nd behaves.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one can attain the spirit and mental state of th=\r\ne servant in this analogy, one&#39;s life will be made.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Read what Manish wrote below:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Once you take Time =\r\nout of the equation (because a deity has a different time space frame which=\r\n runs in thousands of years which pass by in a blink of an eye) by waiting =\r\nwith patience, then where will God go? God has to come, He can&#39;t escape.&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Take time out of the equation, i.e. do not put a time limit =\r\nor say &quot;I have done this sadhana for XYZ years. Why is God not coming?&quot; Wai=\r\nt patiently. After all, if you have truly surrendered, why is it a problem =\r\nthen to wait, let us say, 1000 years for Her grace? If you say &quot;I want Her =\r\nto come in 1 year or 10 years and not 1000 years&quot;, that means you have not =\r\nfully surrendered.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; How to measure it?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One can measure it by seeing how one is internally reacting to ch=\r\nallenging circumstances that would earlier provoke lust, anger, greed, jeal=\r\nosy etc inside one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, what will one do by measuring?

He did so much sadhana of a dei=\r\nty that this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deity began to occupy him day and night. This deit=\r\ny was a form of Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That in turn gave him the rarest of rare=\r\n opportunity to be with Krishna at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time of the battle, beca=\r\nuse Shiva is the greatest Vaishnava, the only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one who knows how=\r\n to worship Krishna properly. Only by becoming Shiva\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself c=\r\nan you worship Krishna perfectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, at the time=\r\n of the battle, Arjun was beset with doubt, but when he saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\n Viswharoopa something crazy happened as if Krishna was within him. Of\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course Krishna was present even before, but Arjun could not perceiv=\r\ne Him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; properly. this was Krishna&#39;s lila or play of course, beca=\r\nuse otherwise would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun have treated him as a friend ever??!!=\r\n(slapping Him on the back,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; playing tricks on Him, but the Lord =\r\nloves to play with His genuine devotees)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, now o=\r\nnce Arjun&#39;s remnant personality was further effaced and replaced by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Krishna in his form as Kaala Viswharoopa, then it was effectively Kris=\r\nhna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who destroyed the Kauravas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why at the =\r\nend of the battle when all the Pandavas went to ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person =\r\nwho had been decapitated by Krishna&#39;s Sudarshana but who was still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; kept alive at the top of the tree,..... about who was responsible for t=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pandava&#39;s victory..... ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that man said wa=\r\ns that at the beginning of the day he could see the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sudarshana =\r\nstart out from one end of the battlefield, then having done all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n that destruction, it would return to krishna&#39;s hand at the end of the day.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the blood which was being spilt was drunk by Krishna Shakt=\r\ni or Kali.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was lucky, He had God incarnate a=\r\nt His side, others may not be quite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so fortunate. For example, =\r\nRamakrishna used to say that a doctor&#39;s money was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blood and pus=\r\n (I left my thriving surgical career when I read this a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yea=\r\nrs ago).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He said something similar about the money earned by a =\r\nlawyer.(I think he was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; referring to criminal law in that time).=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Easiest thing to do is Ishwar(Ishwari) pranidhana=\r\n.

The time then was suc=\r\nh that there was too much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and=\r\n nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tremendou=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed =\r\nto a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extent,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and s=\r\net the tone for it. Arjuna being a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warrior,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply loved and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to k=\r\nill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was born aga=\r\nin in the 19th century as one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s=\r\n sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous lif=\r\ne, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\nis\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new time and place. He was born to renounce material lif=\r\ne despite his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the simple l=\r\nife of a monk and inspire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generations to embrace a simple l=\r\nife of mental detachment and service to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others. When he is =\r\nborn again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said),=\r\n his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky questi=\r\non is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the =\r\nlight of castism. Though the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of caste=\r\n (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a sh=\r\nudra who lived by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a=\r\n maharshi later. Vishwamitra was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita =\r\nand a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; varna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of father, because that is what one is expo=\r\nsed to in childhood. As one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;=\r\ns own varna based on what one does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, t=\r\nhe misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there ar=\r\ne not just 4 dharmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the world. Each perso=\r\nn has individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s=\r\n dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enou=\r\ngh, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is=\r\n surrounded by a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noise from other parts of our minds=\r\n which tell other things. Thus, we get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment combining discrimina=\r\ntion and intuition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is our dha=\r\nrma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage =\r\nin\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions without identification. *That* alone ensures tha=\r\nt we are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing t=\r\nhe load. We should not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too much attachm=\r\nent to what we are doing. We should engage in the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; poss=\r\nible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with as little attachment and se=\r\nlf-identification with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. When the act=\r\nion is finished, we should leave the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\no god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication t=\r\nhrough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; untached action) will simplify our ego and purify ou=\r\nr consciousness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we become purer, o=\r\nur mind will work sharper and tell our dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clearer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to =\r\nsee our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new =\r\nkarmas. This is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not as difficul=\r\nt as people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Even =\r\nif one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action=\r\n with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * =\r\n* *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intelle=\r\nct and intuition are the inputs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another external input is =\r\nthe words of scriptures and learned men. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them.

If one surrenders to a spiritual =\r\nmaster, one can take the words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the master =\r\nto determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought kill=\r\ning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gurus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and relatives was not dharma, he ha=\r\nd a guru in Krishna who clarified his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma.

He follows up for the money but with the attitud=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of detachment. Although he shows to his family and friends =\r\nthat he is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extremely concerned and it was foolish act etc... =\r\nBut in his mind he thinks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it was a rina from some past l=\r\nife which was fulfilled. He thinks that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they were Money of Mo=\r\nther and she will take care. If they needed to come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back, she=\r\n will do it or if they were to be paid to nullify some past rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; then they will not come back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; With the Second Approach, I think, =\r\nMr. FL will not Create New Rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and will be able to break fr=\r\nee from this particular chain. He may have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; successfully PAID =\r\nBACK his debt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; With the first Appro=\r\nach, Mr. FL has identified himself very strongly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with Money a=\r\nnd its ownership and hence all the actions done due to that, so\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; He may have created NEW RINAS which will be needed to settled on a later=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; date.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; However I am not sure for what I have written.

He has ch=\r\nildlike innocence, simplicty, rare humility=C3=83??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and love =\r\nfor all.

You can try to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ignore him an=\r\nd focus on the book. Alternatively, you can also try to get him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; interested in the book and call him to read the book along with you. In =\r\nthe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beginning, he may still distract you and make it more dif=\r\nficult to read.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, it is possible that he also likes the bo=\r\nok and starts enjoying the book\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; along with you and stops dist=\r\nracting you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=83??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; If meditation is like reading a book, weakne=\r\nss for sex is like the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friend and sexual thoughts that arise =\r\nin the mind are like the distractions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caused by the friend, t=\r\nhen aghora&#39;s sadhana I mentioned is like getting the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friend t=\r\no read the book along with you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, as I said, there=\r\n are no guarantees.

Reciting these=\r\n stories on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regular basis will promote the fighting spirit =\r\nwithin one that fights these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Th=\r\nere is nothing wrong in understanding Maayaa and trying to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fi=\r\nght/overcome it at the same time. One aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One aspect of the Mother makes you experience good and bad in=\r\n that Maayaa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One aspect of the Mother makes you understand M=\r\naayaa to overcome it. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aspect of the Mother makes you figh=\r\nt and overcome it. When one realizes Self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; at the end, irrespe=\r\nctive of the path taken, one finally sees that all these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are =\r\naspects of a Single Mother who is also essentially true Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83?? =C3=83?? =C3=83?? =C3=83?? =C3=83?? =C3=83?? =C3=83?? *=C3=\r\n=83?? =C3=83?? =C3=83?? =C3=83?? =C3=83?? =C3=83?? =C3=83?? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I have started to read the =\r\nAghora series books by Dr.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robert\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Svo=\r\nbodha.

Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of th=\r\ne names\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C3=83?? Aghora (aghor=\r\ni) does not see anything as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terrible or bad or impure and see=\r\ns all as impermanent manifestations of god\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and tries to focus=\r\n the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (god)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always, =\r\ninstead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83??\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someon=\r\ne dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carr=\r\nying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remi=\r\nnd oneself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that life and death are just a temporary illusion =\r\nand only the Lord is real.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But the question is: why should we=\r\n remind ourselves of this ultimate truth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only when someone di=\r\nes? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we h=\r\nave done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not =\r\ndwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to some=\r\nthing beautiful and want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;=\r\nRaama naam satya hai. This thing that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems beautiful and oth=\r\ner things that seem not so beautiful are temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions.=\r\n Only \n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
