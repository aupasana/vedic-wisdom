(you can google it) how does karm=\r\na theory explain it. I don&#39;t think any dignified explanation excluding blin=\r\nd beliefs can be given for it. I have found people to be very callous towar=\r\nds such issues and saying &#39;oh its just karma&#39;. that would be very shameful =\r\nif we give such an answer in this condition.\n\nAlso I would like to ask how =\r\nwise it is to reveal important knowledge to naive minds? \n\nRegards,\nSiya.\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
