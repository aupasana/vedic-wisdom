Though many other masters came to earth in the last=\r\n few centuries, who perfected some types of spiritual moods or the other, h=\r\ne is someone who perfected everything. He would chant Hari&#39;s name, melt wit=\r\nh emotion and go into bhaava samaadhi for hours together. He would engage i=\r\nn 64 kriyas of tantra, without his mind being perturbed by anything. He wou=\r\nld be in samadhi where he is at the feet of god. He would be in samadhi whe=\r\nre he is in oneness with god. He would be in nirvikalpa samadhi where there=\r\n are no gods, no demons, no beings or objects, but just Aatman or Brahman.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The same person who would behave like a small child at times woul=\r\nd also show unmatched wisdom all the time. He would transform an illiterate=\r\n servant boy (Latu) into a great spiritual master (Swami Adbhutananda) who =\r\nwas established in Shiva-consciousness at all times. He would transform an =\r\nenergetic, skeptical, irreverant, independent, rational and highly intellig=\r\nent young man with several biases (Naren) into a venerable and compassionat=\r\ne saint known as a great teacher around the world (Swami Vivekananda).\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; He practiced karma yoga and his sishyas and the mutt established by t=\r\nhem engaged in so much social service across India. He practiced jnaana yog=\r\na and his sishyas popularized Adwaita across the world. He even engaged in =\r\nraja yoga and taught a select few like Vivekananda. He of course practiced =\r\nbhakti yoga and melted in devotion when thinking of Kaali in the same way a=\r\ns he did when thought of Krishna. He even did Christian and Islamic sadhana=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; He not only experienced the Absolute himself, but was capable =\r\nof making others experience. His mere touch took Vivekananda into samadhi i=\r\nn their second meeting. Vivekananda experienced other higher states later d=\r\nue to Ramakrishna&#39;s will (e.g. what happened for a few days after he mocked=\r\n the Vedantic statement that all is god, in front of Ramakrishna). Even his=\r\n guru Totapuri who was an adept in Adwaita and experienced nirvikalpa samad=\r\nhi several times was, for the first time in his life, introduced to the pow=\r\ner of the Mother by Ramakrishna. Totapuri considered faith in saguna forms =\r\nof god as childish and believed only in the formless Brahman. But he left D=\r\nakshineshwar with a healthy respect for the Saguna forms. He actually went =\r\ninside the temple and prostrated before the idol before he left Dakshineshw=\r\nar! And, there is the kalpataru day, when people started experiencing diffe=\r\nrent levels of spiritual bliss just by touching him. Everyone who touched h=\r\nim that day went into a spiritual ecstasy and stayed in it frozen right the=\r\nre in the garden. Some even went into different levels of samadhi.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; If this is how the Leela of an incarnation is, imagine how the leela of a=\r\n poorna purusha like Lord Krishna must have been!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I personally lo=\r\nve analogies, allegories, metaphors and parables. Ramakrishna was an absolu=\r\nte master of those. He demystified things and taught the highest Truths in =\r\nsimple terms so that everybody can understand the essence.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Ramakr=\r\nishna is an absolutely unique saint who showed that all paths lead to god, =\r\nnot by stating theory, but by demonstrating it practically.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Unlik=\r\ne saints like Buddha, Aadi Shankara, Moses and Jesus, he is relatively rece=\r\nnt and his life is well-documented.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n The field of duality is like a dream. Being established in Brahman or Aatm=\r\nan is like the wakeful state. All the objects of dream disappear when one i=\r\ns awake. They are unreal. However, they are quite real for one who is still=\r\n in the dream! And, a roaring lion from a dream and a meowing cat from a dr=\r\neam are so different in their nature, abilities and effect. Even though a j=\r\nnaani may tell you there is god (Brahman) in everything and all are equal, =\r\nit is true only for one established in Brahman. If one is awake, a roaring =\r\nlion from a dream and a meowing cat from a dream are equal. But, to somebod=\r\ny still sleeping, both are so different.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Though all beings are bu=\r\nt god, different beings play different roles in the field of Maayaa and the=\r\nre is a clear hierarchy.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short H=\r\nomam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality writin=\r\ngs: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ved=\r\nicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nDear Utpal,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have not read the Kathamrita - so I cannot comm=\r\nent on it really but I found Sri Ramakrishna Lilaprasanga by Swami Saradana=\r\nnda to be an excellent book, exhaustive and detailed in the analysis. Swami=\r\n Saradananda takes so my pains to beautifully explain various aspects of Ra=\r\nmakrishna&#39;s spiritual behaviour and general explanations of spiritual thing=\r\ns as well. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example it is from this book that I first und=\r\nerstood why an Avatar like Ramakrishna had to perform such severe sadhana. =\r\nAlso thiis book gives a detailed recording of Ramakrishna&#39;s Tantric sadhana=\r\ns, how he completed all the 64 kriyas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There is one point I h=\r\nave observed with Ramakrishna&#39;s teachings.His advises are often specific to=\r\n the person he was advising. For someone he may say study the Adhyatma Rama=\r\nyana, for another he advised never to touch the Adhyatma Ramayana! Like a p=\r\nerfect teacher he advised the specific medicine for the specific problem in=\r\n the path of spirituality that the specific person was facing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Second is his  fantastic razor sharp intellect. No one gives better examp=\r\nles to explain some aspect of spirituality than Ramakrishna. Simple yet per=\r\nfect. He uses the intellect to explain yet does not get caught up in the ma=\r\nzes of words. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Third and most important, the range of spiritu=\r\nal moods he expressed was staggering. With all due to respect to every grea=\r\nt master who has walked on this planet, I can&#39;t recall another name who has=\r\n expressed/manifested such diverse spiritual moods. His spiritual journey i=\r\ns not like a bicycle race but rather a seven course meal where he relishes =\r\nevery dish to the core.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Juding purely from an intellectual pe=\r\nrspective, I believe there are some possibility of corruption in the teachi=\r\nngs of almost all masters starting from Jesus to Buddha to Shanakara to Gur=\r\nu Nanak to Chaitanya to Vivekanada to Aurobindo . Corruptions not in the te=\r\naching per se but corruption arising out of misinterpretation of the words =\r\nover time. One cannot really blame them for this because it is almost impos=\r\nsible to forsee what turn of events lead to what kind of mindsets which can=\r\n make their statements/advises defuct or even dangerous over time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; For example, Jesus says I am the path. Obviously Christians have mist=\r\nook this to understand that Jesus is the only path. What he ment by I may n=\r\not be Jesus the man, but Jesus the idea - of purity and of love.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Buddha gave a practical advise that Nirvana is sunya and practical spir=\r\nituality is more important than spiritual discussion. People mistook that t=\r\no understand Budha was as atheist.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shanakara, the great man t=\r\nhat he was, would have died of a heart attack if he saw the flippant way in=\r\n which we later day college educated Indians use the phrases like Aham Brah=\r\nmasmi and everything is Brahman as if we are speaking about the latest movi=\r\ne in town.  Also I feel his misjudged certain paths like Tantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Guru Nanak in order to infuse more life into spirituality of Hindus as =\r\nwell as Muslims and bring a comprise in the two ideas decried practises lik=\r\ne idol worship and pitri tarpan.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chaitanya was the emotional =\r\npinnacle of spirituality. He was capable. Others less capable misunderstood=\r\n the path to feel that without shedding bucket full of tears you wont land =\r\nat God&#39;s doorsteps. Emotions are good, but they can mislead too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Vivekananda - absolute leader. Like all leaders, he does make some stat=\r\nements at times which are not well deliberated upon, which results in misin=\r\nterpretations later on. Of course a leader cannot be expected to think for =\r\nten days before speaking one  sentence. A leader has to be spontaneous, jus=\r\nt like Vivekanada, but the price of spontaneity is misrepresentation at a l=\r\nater date specially if you are fantastic.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aurobindo, brillian=\r\nt and rare analysis of spiritual steps/stages. One that I have never found =\r\nin any other writing. However the problem is exactly the same. Often people=\r\n wrongly believe that only by reading and intellectually comprehending Auro=\r\nbindo;s writings one can make spiritual progress. There is no substitute fo=\r\nr raw old fashioned sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please note all these are great =\r\nmen were without question, spiritually much realized. I am merely doing an =\r\nintellectual analysis from a historial perspective.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; And then =\r\nRamakrishna, such a vast range of emotions and practices coupled with simpl=\r\ne and pointed examples and advises, it is hardly possible for him to get mi=\r\nsinterpreted. He uses Shanakra&#39;s phrase &quot;Brahma satya jagat mithya&quot; but he =\r\nalso teaches Totapuri why Mahamaya is so powerful. He seems like a perfect =\r\nassimilation of all ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just my two cents. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n-Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bha=\r\nirava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Fri, 20/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_=\r\npathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subje=\r\nct: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Ramakrishna deals with a debater.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Friday, 20 November, 2009, 9:17 PM\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;That is the effect of Ramakrishna=\r\n, who was born and brought up in a &gt;village in west bengal, who probably co=\r\nuld not even sign his own &gt;name.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna, whom i lovingly =\r\naddress as &#39;Thakur&#39; is simply Rama and Krishna and no less......\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; And Kathamruta is THE book which has given answers and confirmations to =\r\nmy queries and understandings which haunted me from childhood.

The =\r\nbrahmani - who was Thakur&#39;s guru - had called Gauri for a session of discus=\r\nsion on the spiritual abilities etc of Thakur. Now Gauri was a very famous =\r\ndebater and a sadhaka=C3=82 who never lost any debate. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Plus Thakur=\r\n used to say that Gauri had remakrable siddhis. He used to perform a homa o=\r\nf Ma Kali by stretching out his left hand, piling wood on the bare=C3=82 ar=\r\nm, lighting it and then using his right hand to pour ghee! And the homa wou=\r\nld last for an hour or more and he would keep his left hand perfectly still=\r\n all this while. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He had a certain siddhi in the us=\r\ne of a mantra of Ma Kali by virtue of which one could never win in a debate=\r\n=C3=82 against him. Plus he had a deep, resounding voice which Ramakrishna =\r\ndescribed as the &quot;rumbling of clouds&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Gauri e=\r\nntered the Dakshineshwar temple precinct and saw the Kali temple, he starte=\r\nd repeating the mantra mentally. Thakur at that time was coming out of the =\r\ntemple. On seeing Gauri suddenly Ramakrishna started saying that specific m=\r\nantra (the one Gauri was chanting) loudly so that Gauri could hear. Gauri, =\r\non being thus challanged=C3=82 started shouting the mantra even louded. To =\r\nthis Ramakrishna felt as if someone had just given him a divine voice and h=\r\ne too thundered back. Gauri was even more amazed. He roared again=C3=82 but=\r\n Ramakrishna roared louder. Finally, suddenly Gauri realized he has lost hi=\r\ns voice. And his siddhi too! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At first he was furio=\r\nus with anger and ego but soon he became friends with Ramakrishna. Finally =\r\nhe proclaimed that Ramakrishna was He by a fraction of whose power do Avata=\r\nrs come down on earth. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Later one day Gauri came to=\r\n Ramakrishna asking for his blessing to take sanyasa. He quit debating and =\r\nwent away from that place, promising that he would not return untill he rea=\r\nlized the Self. Thakur also blessed him according.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That is the effect of Ramakrishna, who was born and brought=\r\n up in a village in west bengal, who probably could not even sign his own n=\r\name.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
