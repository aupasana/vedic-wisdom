I was unable to contact another Boston priest relate=\r\nd to him, who I suspected could take care of this.\n=C2=A0\nPeople may give y=\r\nou various mantras for this purpose. But they may or may not work. If Tendu=\r\nlkar or Dhoni tells you how you can play a good shot on a particular kind o=\r\nf ball, you may not be able to play that shot right away. Even if it is an =\r\neasy shot, it may take a lot of practice for you to get it right. Even with=\r\n mantras, one needs enough focused practice for them to work for one.\n\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nIn general, it is far easier (relatively) to fix weakness of mind and p=\r\nrotect it, before it reaches a crisis point like this. Hanuman, Bhairava, C=\r\nhandi, Narasimha - so many deities can be worshipped for this purpose. Howe=\r\nver, fixing it after it reaches a crisis point requires someone who has eno=\r\nugh shakti and knows how to direct it.\n=C2=A0\nSome replies referred to sain=\r\nts/swamis who are very pure/elevated etc. Even if one is pure or elevated, =\r\none may not necessarily be able to help. This really requires some shakti a=\r\nnd the ability to direct it for this specific task.\n\n=C2=A0\nThough I live i=\r\nn the area, I am not capable of doing anything personally. However, if anyb=\r\nody in troubles like this is interested and visits me, I can give some ash =\r\nfrom my daily homam of divine Mother. They can apply it on the forehead of =\r\nthe person everyday. Of course, I don&#39;t know if it will help in any way.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nIf interested, please send a private email to pvr108@....\n\n=C2=\r\n=A0Best regards,\n\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt;__________________________=\r\n______\n&gt; From: &quot;b_jamnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;To: vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;Sent: Saturday, August 10, 2013 5:51 PM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;Thank you very much Rajarshi.

I am sure there too one =\r\ncan find good exorcists, maybe not of our religion. \n&gt;\n&gt;I have very little =\r\nknowledge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have never ever =\r\ntried any sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.\n&gt;\n&gt;However, there is a partic=\r\nular mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considered to be of excellent potency=\r\n for these kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, known =\r\nas Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as the one=\r\n whose mother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be found in=\r\n the Rudrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bha=\r\nirava has been invoked for centuries by followers of Shakta/Aghor tradition=\r\ns for protection against spirits, and specially during rituals\n of crematio=\r\nn ground. \n&gt;\n&gt;The standard mantra is (there are many variations of this man=\r\ntra too, all are good):\n&gt;\n&gt;&quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaarnnaay Kuru Kuru =\r\nVatukaay Hreem Om&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;Generally, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be=\r\n done in one sitting. And this should be continued daily till such time tha=\r\nt there is some visible relief. One more thing is that, IF, this is a reall=\r\ny genuine instance of spirit possession, as far as I have seen, it would be=\r\n quite impossible to rid the problem by any exorcist from a distance. These=\r\n days almost no one has that kind of terrific shakti to cure a case of poss=\r\nession from a distance. Physical presence in front of the victim is a must =\r\nfor the one trying to help.=C2=A0So close family members, who live with the=\r\n girl will have to do the sadhana. If you go through the Bhairava homam man=\r\nual by Narasimha, you will find methods of doing homas with this mantra. Bu=\r\nt I guess being in a foreign land homas may not be that easy.\n&gt;\n&gt;If the fam=\r\nily visits India, then I have a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, t=\r\no visit Kashi and then go to either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava tem=\r\nple. Once inside the temple speak to the main priest stating the problem. A=\r\nround these two temples in Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live =\r\nwho are adepts in removing any kind of negative influence. They may charge =\r\na certain fee for the ritual and then ask the parents and the girl to come =\r\nwith some specific samagris on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and t=\r\nhen perform their rituals. Many I know have actually benefited. This is one=\r\n method. I am sure their maybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to=\r\n my mind. \n&gt;\n&gt;Hope this\n helps.\n&gt;\n&gt;-Regards\n&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethe=\r\nreal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter thro=\r\nugh them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt; From:=\r\n &quot;b_jamnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom \n&gt;Sent: Saturday, 10 August 2013 6:36 PM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] R=\r\ne: Mantra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;Namas=\r\nte.

For there are variou=\r\ns classes and kinds and types of entities which can possess an individual a=\r\nnd some of them can be downright nasty.\n&gt;\n&gt;Upayas are many. As so many diff=\r\nerent people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* work, theoretically, bu=\r\nt whether any one of them will actually work in a specific case or not depe=\r\nnds on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guarantee of any method. It=\r\n all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has possessed the individua=\r\nl and what their link for the same is. By link it means one has to find out=\r\n the root, or source of exactly what action allowed them to enter into the =\r\nperson. Sometimes it can be something as simple as spitting somewhere (wher=\r\ne this being(s) reside), or\n causally entering into their territory and bei=\r\nng susceptible to such possession by certain weakness in the mind and body,=\r\n or in some cases where such entities are deliberately send to cause harm t=\r\no an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, there is no sure shot one=\r\n stop method of removing and handling such a situation. It all depends on t=\r\nhe shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that those trying to help=\r\n are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Moreover, if the spirit=\r\n of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then unless the person tryin=\r\ng to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to serious harm.\n&gt;\n&gt;The=\r\nse things like removing possession are specializations. These do not fall u=\r\nnder the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows well what one is getting=\r\n into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense would do best to stay away.=\r\n Every action has its repercussion and one must know well how to handle the=\r\n same too. Again\n if a spirit is removed by force before the time till whic=\r\nh, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be in possession of the indi=\r\nvidual, then that too starts a new karmic chain which will involve some not=\r\n so pleasant consequences for the person who tried to remove the spirit. It=\r\n is all a complex chain.\n&gt;\n&gt;[Reminds me of a particular individual I knew s=\r\nome years ago who was an expert in exorcism. But before starting any exorci=\r\nsm he would ask his Guides to tell him about the spirit as well as the time=\r\n frame for which the spirit would stay in possession as per the previous ka=\r\nrmic link between the spirit and the victim. Then he would sit and do ritua=\r\nls daily to entice the spirit to leave the body of its own free will, promi=\r\nsing good deeds for the spirit in return. Never trying to remove it by forc=\r\ne. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where the spirit is of a very viole=\r\nnt nature, force had to be applied.]\n&gt;\n&gt;Best thing to do is a) find someone=\r\n\n who knows exactly how to deal with spirit possession and hope for the bes=\r\nt. b) In the event the first is not possible, ask family members to pick sa=\r\ndhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bhairava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,pa=\r\nnchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are better) - and do it with samkalpa =\r\nwith sufficient force and will and time. Which means, a 10-20 mins path of =\r\nhanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on the degree of possession. Someone =\r\nmay have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any sadhana with the mental belief/f=\r\naith/will/determination to see this through to the very end. While doing th=\r\ne sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper pot, and then either make the po=\r\nssessed individual drink the water or sprinkle it on him/her. And pray as h=\r\nard as possible. \n&gt;\n&gt;Best of luck and may God help the family.\n&gt;\n&gt;-Regards\n=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet=\r\n/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I will with heart insatiat=\r\ne/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri Aurobindo\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;_______=\r\n_________________________\n&gt; From: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;Sent: =\r\nSaturday, 10 August 2013 8:17 AM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Mantra fo=\r\nr protection from spirits (at nighttime)\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;Thank you Nithin,=\r\n I will convey this to the parents.

I had trouble falling aslee=\r\np, because I could hear strange noises -  creaking and something moving in =\r\nthe attic. I&#39;m very sensitive to different energies - I don&#39;t see anything,=\r\n but I feel whether something divine or rather evil is present in a certain=\r\n place. That place didn&#39;t feel good to me.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;I was staying there for=\r\n 10 days and every night I would make up because of a feeling of somebody s=\r\ntaring at me - I could see them but once I started focusing on them, they v=\r\nanished. Sometimes I would wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. =\r\nOne day I could definitely hear some steps near the bed and a roar. I reach=\r\ned for my flashlight to see nothing.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep =\r\nparalysis to me - I instantly become fully aware and I can move my body.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Can it be that spirits live in that place disturbing my sleep? There=\r\n were a few more people staying at that place and everybody had severe prob=\r\nlems with sleep, so it&#39;s not just me.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted =\r\nSri Rudram at that place before going to sleep and this was the only night =\r\nI was able to sleep properly.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that plac=\r\ne I started waking up at home, feeling some strong presence - usually some =\r\nshort beings (up to 50 cm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); On=\r\nce the sun rises, all of the strange feelings disappear and I can sleep pea=\r\ncefully.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will protect me from all kinds o=\r\nf astral beings at night?

I am sure there too one can find g=\r\nood exorcists, maybe not of our religion. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have very little knowle=\r\ndge about Panchamukhi Hanumana, infact unfortunately have never ever tried =\r\nany sadhana of Lord Hanumana till date.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, there is a particul=\r\nar mantra of Lord Bhairava which is considered to be of excellent potency f=\r\nor these kind of problems. This form of Bhairava is a small child, known as=\r\n Vatuka. As per some Tantrik scriptures He is also referred to as the one w=\r\nhose mother is Sahashra Chandika. References to this form can be found in t=\r\nhe Rudrayamala, at least some versions of the Rudrayamala. This child Bhair=\r\nava has been invoked for centuries by followers of Shakta/Aghor traditions =\r\nfor protection against spirits, and specially during rituals\n of cremation =\r\nground. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The standard mantra is (there are many variations of this m=\r\nantra too, all are good):&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Om Hreem Vatukaay Aapad Uddhaar=\r\nnnaay Kuru Kuru Vatukaay Hreem Om&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Generally=\r\n, at least 10/11 malas of the same should be done in one sitting. And this =\r\nshould be continued daily till such time that there is some visible relief.=\r\n One more thing is that, IF, this is a really genuine instance of spirit po=\r\nssession, as far as I have seen, it would be quite impossible to rid the pr=\r\noblem by any exorcist from a distance. These days almost no one has that ki=\r\nnd of terrific shakti to cure a case of possession from a distance. Physica=\r\nl presence in front of the victim is a must for the one trying to help.&nbs=\r\np;So close family members, who live with the girl will\n have to do the sadh=\r\nana. If you go through the Bhairava homam manual by Narasimha, you will fin=\r\nd methods of doing homas with this mantra. But I guess being in a foreign l=\r\nand homas may not be that easy.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If the family visits India, then I h=\r\nave a suggestion. Please ask them, if possible, to visit Kashi and then go =\r\nto either the Kalabhairava or Vatuka Bhairava temple. Once inside the templ=\r\ne speak to the main priest stating the problem. Around these two temples in=\r\n Kashi, many excellent sadhakas of Bhairava live who are adepts in removing=\r\n any kind of negative influence. They may charge a certain fee for the ritu=\r\nal and then ask the parents and the girl to come with some specific samagri=\r\ns on a specific day/tithi inside the temple and then perform their rituals.=\r\n Many I know have actually benefited. This is one method. I am sure their m=\r\naybe other methods too. I just wrote what came to my mind. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Hope thi=\r\ns\n helps.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:16px;font-family:Verdana, sans-serif;backg=\r\nround-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, =\r\nserif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv6004766476MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn class=3D&quot;yiv6004766476Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn class=3D&quot;yiv6004766476Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(153, 153, 153)=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv6004766476yui_3_2_0_2_1342435272=\r\n49950&quot;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit eth=\r\nereal, /&lt;/span&gt; Be sure I will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hun=\r\nter through them all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, =\r\nnew york, times, serif;&quot;&gt; -Sri Aurobindo&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span\n class=3D&quot;yiv600476647=\r\n6yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yiv6004766476yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952\n yiv6=\r\n004766476yui_3_2_0_2_137332740501958&quot; style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FO=\r\nNT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-family:Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font=\r\n-size:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, s=\r\nerif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font face=3D&quot;Ari=\r\nal&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;b_ja=\r\nmnadas@...&quot; &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-wei=\r\nght:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, 10 August 2013 6:36 PM&lt;br=\r\n&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdo=\r\nm] Re: Mantra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt;=\r\n &lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv6004766476y_msg_container&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv6004766476&quot;&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv6004766476ygrp=\r\n-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamaste.

They both say=\r\n that this is an entity that keeps revisiting the little girl.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The doctors themselves are treating this as psychiatric case. =\r\nDon&#39;t know what is true and what is not as no one has been able to help inc=\r\nluding the doctors.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Do you know of any particular =\r\nKali, Bhairav or Panchmukhi Hanuman mantra which they could recite? I could=\r\n advice that they learn this and\n recite as u have advised.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv id=3D&quot;yiv6004766476-sig-id&quot;&gt;Thanks, &lt;br&gt;Bhupendra &lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b=\r\n&gt;From:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;rajarshi nandy&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;To:&lt;/b&gt; &quot;v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Sen=\r\nt:&lt;/b&gt; August 10, 2013 4:01 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Subject:&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Ma=\r\nntra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv6004766476ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;color:#000;background-color:#fff;font-family:Courier New, courier,=\r\n monaco, monospace, sans-serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt;Namaste Sir,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A posse=\r\nssion by a foreign entity, IF genuine, is always a very serious matter. For=\r\n there are various classes and kinds and types of entities which can posses=\r\ns an individual and some of them can be downright nasty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Upayas are =\r\nmany. As so many different people have advised, these all sadhanas *can* wo=\r\nrk, theoretically, but whether any one of them will actually work in a spec=\r\nific case or not depends on multiple factors. Basically, there is no guaran=\r\ntee of any method. It all depends on what kind of spirit(s)/being(s) has po=\r\nssessed the individual and what their link for the same is. By link it mean=\r\ns one has to find out the root, or source of exactly what action allowed th=\r\nem to enter into the person. Sometimes it can be something as simple as spi=\r\ntting somewhere (where this being(s) reside), or\n causally entering into th=\r\neir territory and being susceptible to such possession by certain weakness =\r\nin the mind and body, or in some cases where such entities are deliberately=\r\n send to cause harm to an individual, ETC ETC. Whatever be the source, ther=\r\ne is no sure shot one stop method of removing and handling such a situation=\r\n. It all depends on the shakti of the spirit, and the amount of shakti that=\r\n those trying to help are able to generate in order to remove the spirit.Mo=\r\nreover, if the spirit of a violent and extremely malevolent nature, then un=\r\nless the person trying to remove it is an adept in this, he/she may come to=\r\n serious harm.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These things like removing possession are specializat=\r\nions. These do not fall under the ambit of normal sadhana. Unless one knows=\r\n well what one is getting into, any sadhaka with even basic common sense wo=\r\nuld do best to stay away. Every action has its repercussion and one must kn=\r\now well how to handle the same too. Again\n if a spirit is removed by force =\r\nbefore the time till which, based on previous karma, it was supposed to be =\r\nin possession of the individual, then that too starts a new karmic chain wh=\r\nich will involve some not so pleasant consequences for the person who tried=\r\n to remove the spirit. It is all a complex chain.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;[Reminds me of a p=\r\narticular individual I knew some years ago who was an expert in exorcism. B=\r\nut before starting any exorcism he would ask his Guides to tell him about t=\r\nhe spirit as well as the time frame for which the spirit would stay in poss=\r\nession as per the previous karmic link between the spirit and the victim. T=\r\nhen he would sit and do rituals daily to entice the spirit to leave the bod=\r\ny of its own free will, promising good deeds for the spirit in return. Neve=\r\nr trying to remove it by force. Most cases it would work. Rare cases where =\r\nthe spirit is of a very violent nature, force had to be applied.]&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Be=\r\nst thing to do is a) find someone\n who knows exactly how to deal with spiri=\r\nt possession and hope for the best. b) In the event the first is not possib=\r\nle, ask family members to pick sadhana/mantra of any deity - preferably Bha=\r\nirava, Kali, Chandi, Narasimha,panchamukhi Hanumana ETC (fierce forms are b=\r\netter) - and do it with samkalpa with sufficient force and will and time. W=\r\nhich means, a 10-20 mins path of hanuman chalisa may not help. Depends on t=\r\nhe degree of possession. Someone may have to spend 3-5 hours daily with any=\r\n sadhana with the mental belief/faith/will/determination to see this throug=\r\nh to the very end. While doing the sadhana keep a bowl of water in a copper=\r\n pot, and then either make the possessed individual drink the water or spri=\r\nnkle it on him/her. And pray as hard as possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best of luck and =\r\nmay God help the family.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:tim=\r\nes new roman, new york,\n times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;yiv6004766476MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, =\r\nnew york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv6004766476Apple-style-span&quot; s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-size:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv6004766476Apple-style-span&quot; s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;color:rgb(153, 153, 153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv=\r\n6004766476yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot;&gt;I have a hundred lives before me yet=\r\n/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, /&lt;/span&gt; Be sure I will with heart i=\r\nnsatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt; -Sri Aurobindo&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yiv6004766476yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yiv6004766476y=\r\nui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yiv6004766476yui_3_2_0_2_137332740501958&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/=\r\ni&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:Courier New, courier, mo=\r\nnaco, monospace,\n sans-serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;=\r\nhr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-wei=\r\nght:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, 10 August 2013 8:17 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: =\r\nMantra for protection from spirits (at nighttime)&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;yiv6004766476y_msg_container&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv6004766476&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv6004766476ygrp-text&quot;&gt;=\r\n\n      \n      \n      &lt;table border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Thank you Nithin, I will c=\r\nonvey this to the parents.

I had trouble falling asleep, because I could hear strange noises =\r\n-  creaking and something moving in the attic. I&#39;m very sensitive to differ=\r\nent energies - I don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether something divine or=\r\n rather evil is present in a certain place. That place didn&#39;t feel good to =\r\nme.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and every ni=\r\nght I would make up because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I coul=\r\nd see them but once I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I =\r\nwould wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could defin=\r\nitely hear some steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight =\r\nto see nothing.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep par=\r\nalysis to me - I instantly become fully aware and I can move my body.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Can it be that spirits live in that place disturbing =\r\nmy sleep? There were a few more people staying at that place and everybody =\r\nhad severe problems with sleep, so it&#39;s not just me.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at that place before going to s=\r\nleep and this was the only night I was able to sleep properly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that place I started waking up at=\r\n home, feeling some strong presence - usually some short beings (up to 50 c=\r\nm in height, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); Once the sun rises, all of=\r\n the strange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Is there any mantra that will protect me from all kinds of astr=\r\nal beings at night? Something that I can chant before going to sleep. This =\r\nhas been bothering me for some time now and it interferes with my life.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thank you in advance!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/td&gt;\n                                    &lt;/=\r\ntr&gt;\n                                &lt;/tbody&gt;\n                            &lt;/=\r\ntable&gt;\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/td&gt;\n                                    &lt;/tr&gt;\n   =\r\n                             &lt;/tbody&gt;\n                            &lt;/table&gt;\n=\r\n                    &lt;/div&gt;\n                &lt;/div&gt;\n            &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    =\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n   =\r\n &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n    &lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--944242502-839869522-1377131493=:47276--\r\n\n"}}
