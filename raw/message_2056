His=\r\n message was one of unity, maintaining that Hinduism and Buddhism should pe=\r\nacefully coexist and collaborate. Tibetan Buddhism and Hinduism have many s=\r\nimilarities, which I will not get into now, but in my post I was trying to =\r\nwork towards an understanding of how the cycle of war/urbanization/chaotic =\r\nvice may be effected=A0by world religion. Obviously, this is a very ambitio=\r\nus topic for a message board, but one worthy of exploration in some context=\r\n.\n=A0\nJust as Christianity must answer for the crusades, there are some thi=\r\nngs for which both Hinduism and Buddhism must answer, first on the practica=\r\nl plane of world suffering, and secondly on the theoretical plane of abstra=\r\nct causality. Himmler&#39;s having carried around a copy of the Bhagavad Gita, =\r\nOppenheimer&#39;s affinity with the same, and the Nazi interest in the religion=\r\n of Tibet and Buddhism ... these are all things which are not commonly delv=\r\ned into by academics or mainstream historians due to the their decidedly my=\r\nstical bent, and their suggestion of a particular brand of amorality which =\r\nis rarely assimilated into Western thought, let alone media. The confusion =\r\nover the relationship between the practical causes of world suffering and t=\r\nhe religious texts and themes which seem to crop up in their midst is=A0suc=\r\nh a vast and daunting object of study, that there is no easy means of appro=\r\nach to it. The concept of karmic rnanubhanda provides a seemingly\n convenie=\r\nnt handle, but it would be exhausting to apply this thoroughly to an unders=\r\ntanding of the afore-mentioned cycle of suffering. \n=A0\nWhen looking at the=\r\n vast field of what may be called, for lack of a better term, death cult af=\r\nfinities, throughout the world, it seems logical to consider what role vari=\r\nous world religions play in the negative conditioning patterns which govern=\r\n global consciousness. But the idea which seems to me most compelling is th=\r\nat this all is a result of imbalance between Shaivic and Shaktic energies. =\r\nAnd I was suggesting that the very notion of Buddhism, itself, stemming fro=\r\nm the legend of the Buddha leaving his home, is based on an unbalanced foun=\r\ndation. Of course, this would also be tantamount to suggesting that Buddha =\r\nwas not a Vishnu incarnation. But all such speculation is perhaps irrelevan=\r\nt, in that many buddhists, not to mention Hindus,=A0would not admit of such=\r\n a relation in the first place. =A0It is not unreasonable to consider that =\r\nall suffering is the direct result of the misuse of shakti, caused by the o=\r\nverreaching of the ego. A purely balanced\n management of sexual energy, whi=\r\nch tantra prescribes, would seem to cure the problem, as long as it could b=\r\ne maintained. I was also, in my original post, implying that the perpetuato=\r\nrs of the cyclic=A0 intoxication/sex/death habit were all worshippers of Ka=\r\nli, but poor worshippers, and poor managers of shakti, because they burn ou=\r\nt fast, and leave a trail of more suffering behind them. Kali is the highes=\r\nt goddess they can conceive of, the Destroyer, so they sacrifice to her. Yo=\r\nu mention that they are not Aghoris. I would say that it is a question of s=\r\nemantics, in that everyone is an Aghori, just some are more successful at i=\r\nt than others.\n=A0\nAny religion or practice which does not offer a life-aff=\r\nirming balance between Shaivic and Shaktic energies will conjure some godde=\r\nss to be its symbol. In the collective unconscious we have already been giv=\r\nen the paradisiacal symbols of the Garden of Eden, the embrace of Radha/Kri=\r\nshna and the mountain-top reveries of Shiva/Parvati. To descend from these =\r\nvisions into any other view appears pathological, and asking for trouble.

It seems=\r\n to me like you have a unique background.\n=A0\nThough I always insist that d=\r\nirect experience is far more important than theoretical discussions, it is =\r\nuseful to discuss sometimes.\n=A0\nMy background is mainly in vedanta and san=\r\natana dharma and not in Buddhism. I will comment on your post based on MY u=\r\nnderstanding of what your background is and what you are saying. Your mail =\r\nis quite loaded and I will respond only to some salient points in a freewhe=\r\neling manner.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nMy wo=\r\nrld view is slightly different. Aatman is that which is in ALL beings and t=\r\nhings as the non-dual and permanent reality. But we do not perceive Aatman =\r\nand perceive only the objects of the dual world, which are impermanent. How=\r\never, the impermanent objects of this dual world too are made of Aatman and=\r\n non-different from Aatman. They do not consist of &quot;anaatman&quot; (non-aatman) =\r\n, but aatman only. Let me give an analogy.\n=A0\nA ripple in the pond is also=\r\n part of pond and not non-pond. While the pond is stationary and permanent,=\r\n the ripple is moving and transient. It will vanish after a while and merge=\r\n in the stationary pond. Some ripples die away too fast and some take a ver=\r\ny long time. Some transform from one structure to another before they vanis=\r\nh. But each ripple vanishes eventually and the pond remains in the place wh=\r\nere there was a ripple once. As a matter of fact, even when the ripple exis=\r\nted, one can still view it as the pond and not as a ripple.\n=A0\nAatman or B=\r\nrahman described by Veda and Upanishad is like the pond. All beings of the =\r\ndual world that are perceivable to us are like the ripples in the pond. The=\r\ny arise, they move, they get transformed into different shapes, they intera=\r\nct with each other and get disturbed by each other and eventually they slow=\r\n down and vanish.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nT=\r\nhus, we do not talk in terms of aatman and anaatman (non-aatman) . We consi=\r\nder everything as aatman. However, some parts of imperishable aatman seem p=\r\nerishable because of our way of looking, when our perspective is limited by=\r\n duality.\n=A0\nThe preservational and destructive aspects are both part of d=\r\nuality and non-dual aatman is free from all such considerations. Nothing is=\r\n created or preserved or destroyed in aatman. But, when one looks from a pe=\r\nrspective that is limited by duality, it seems like there are objects being=\r\n created, preserved and destroyed.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nOne gets liberation or moksha when one&#39;s perspective is not=\r\n limited by the duality. Even when stuck in a ripple that feels like a viol=\r\nent whirlpool, if one can think &quot;I am the pond&quot; and act like it, then one i=\r\ns liberated. If a ripple is going to come hit the ripple one is in and dist=\r\nurb one&#39;s stability, if one can still think &quot;I am the pond&quot; and act like it=\r\n, then one is liberated. Of course, I am talking in terms of the analogy I =\r\nintroduced earlier.\n=A0\nWhen one is not liberated and one&#39;s perspective is =\r\nclouded by duality, one experiences happiness, sadness, love, lust, hatred,=\r\n anger, jealosy etc and various emotions. When one is liberated and one&#39;s p=\r\nerspective is not limited by duality, one is filled with great bliss. This =\r\nwas the goal of Buddha as well as Vedic rishis.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =\r\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nThough rishis declared that everything is Aatm=\r\nan and inability to recognize it is due to one&#39;s perspective being limited =\r\nby duality, they did not leave it at that. They did not say &quot;this duality i=\r\ns nonsense or delusion or magic or anaatman. Just get over it&quot;, because get=\r\nting over it is not easy. For one stuck in a whirlpool in a pond and panick=\r\ning, the mere preaching &quot;ignore the whirlpool and think of the pond&quot; is use=\r\nless.\n=A0\nThey prescribed various paths that are appropriate for people of =\r\nvarious backgrounds to slowly get over duality. In fact, for people who do =\r\nnot want to get over duality and want to remain in it, manipulate it to the=\r\nir [temporary] advantage and enjoy it also, they prescribed various paths.\n=\r\n=A0\nThe respect rishis showed to both non-dual Aatman AND the field of dual=\r\nity is perhaps unique to sanatana dharma and perhaps missing in Buddhism.\n=\r\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nAghora is not meant=\r\n to be a path of addition to sex or drugs or pain. It is the path of seeing=\r\n Aatman even in depraving conditions. If an aghori&#39;s focus of mind wavers f=\r\nrom the chosen deity and becomes aware of the body or its sense inputs, the=\r\nn he has failed badly. Only a sadhaka with a very high level of purity alre=\r\nady is capable of testing himself/herself in depraving conditions and see i=\r\nf they disturb the mental focus on god. As Svoboda correctly points out at =\r\nthe beginning of his book on Aghora, the sadhakas who are pure enough to su=\r\ncceed in Aghora practices usually are not attracted to Aghora and those who=\r\n find the practices attractive are usually not pure enough to succeed in th=\r\nem.\n=A0\nHowever, we cannot equate goddess worship to aghora. Aghora is a se=\r\nt of extreme practices. Goddess worship has a wide range of practices in In=\r\ndia. Some worship the goddess without any &quot;self-destruction&quot; or even self-d=\r\neprivation and pursue rank materialism along with goddess worship. Some wor=\r\nship goddess with varying levels of self-deprivation aimed at slowly limiti=\r\nng the influence of sense inputs and considerations of sense pleasures/pain=\r\ns on the ability of the mind to focus on the Divine. Sanatana dharma has a =\r\nwide variety of practices that are appropriate for people of various level =\r\nof spiritual evolution and various degrees of internal purity.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nBut, given the wide variety of=\r\n teachings and practices available, people sometimes lap up the wrong teach=\r\nings for them. For example, one person may claim &quot;I am Brahman, I am imperi=\r\nshable aatman, I am Buddha and I have to do no sadhana&quot;. A pretension or a =\r\nmere academic statement is not a substitute for an internal *realization* .=\r\n If a terrible strife befalls, like a slow and painful death or a debilitat=\r\ning disease or terrible injury, one may start saying &quot;I am in great pain&quot;. =\r\nWell, if one is Brahman, there is no pain or pleasure.\n=A0\nOne should reali=\r\nze that teachings relating to non-duality are inapplicable to most people a=\r\nnd they need to do some sadhana to wade the field duality and reach non-dua=\r\nlity. In this light, we must appreciate the respectful treatment of duality=\r\n by rishis (who themselves had overcome it completely) and their teaching o=\r\nf many tools to slowly wade it.\n=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\nDo a Short Homam =\r\nYourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yah=\r\noo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. =\r\nhome.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n--=\r\n---------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n=A0=\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;jberger001&quot; &lt;jberger001@. ..&gt; wrot=\r\ne:\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I recently joined this group after having been forwarded=\r\n some interesting posts by a colleague. As an introductory post, I would li=\r\nke to address a theme that is most pressing in my current worldview, namely=\r\n the problem of reconciling the preservational aspect of Atman with what ap=\r\npears to be the dominance of a dark embrace between Anatman theory and the =\r\nAghori path throughout most of the world. I don&#39;t think this is as simple a=\r\ns recongnizing that Shaivic and Vishnaivic energies are held in constant ba=\r\nlance, because the focus of the argument seems more oriented toward an almo=\r\nst unconscious Kali worship among parts of the world in which Buddhism is p=\r\nlanting or has planted roots. \n&gt; \n&gt; For some time I have struggled with the=\r\n unsettling suspicion that Buddhism is a terrible trap for the mind to stum=\r\nble upon. Ever since I heard a clip of U.G. Krishnamurti saying that Buddhi=\r\nsm introduced the concept of conversion into the world, and perhaps before,=\r\n I have been plagued by this suspicion. It appears that Anatman theory mere=\r\nly creates a a playground for various forms of absurdity which manifest the=\r\nmselves as a culture&#39;s obsession with sex and death, which result in the ec=\r\nonomy of many parts of the world being driven by war and prostitution. \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Now the Aghori path is what is is for most people: a path of self-destruc=\r\ntion which is also a form of Goddess worship. But I would maintain that suc=\r\nh naive practitioners of this path have used, consciously or unconsciously,=\r\n the prevalent Anatman-related theories as excuses to perpetuate the endles=\r\ns cycle of imperialism, heroin-trafficking and prostitution that generally =\r\ndrives world economy. Because of this fatal misunderstanding of Shaivic ene=\r\nrgies, along with the corresponding fascination with the lingo of Anatman t=\r\nheory, most of the world has become a wasteland of dispersed energy, premat=\r\nurely sacrificed to Kali without a shred of taste or sophistication. \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nIt is here that I suppose one could get into some kind of nirvikalpa/savika=\r\nlp a samadhi debate regarding whether the Buddha, by renouncing his family,=\r\n actually created the disintegration of focus which is symbolic of the stat=\r\ne of the world, in that Atman theory, represented by Hinduism is left holdi=\r\nng down the homestead while Anatman theory actually creates suffering by at=\r\ntempting to remove it through meditation. I would submit that the current s=\r\ntate of world dharma locked in some kind of identity crisis over who is sup=\r\nposed to be holding Kali&#39;s left leg and who the right. This is the essentia=\r\nl problem, Shiva just lay there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Jeff Berger\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n      \r\n--0-531112200-1246218862=:59082\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Narasimha,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thanks for your thorough reply to what was a quite unfocused origin=\r\nal post.Granted, I employed a non-standard usage of the term Aatman, which =\r\nmay be traced to my having seen a documentary on the Kumbh Mela festival ca=\r\nlled &quot;Shortcut to Nirvana&quot; wherein the Dalai Lama, in one of his speeches, =\r\nwas making a distinction between Aatman and Anaatman theory, relating to th=\r\ne former to Hinduism and the latter to his own practice.

I=\r\nt seems to me like you have a unique background.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Though I alwa=\r\nys insist that direct experience is far more important than theoretical dis=\r\ncussions, it is useful to discuss sometimes.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;My background is =\r\nmainly in vedanta and sanatana dharma and not in Buddhism. I will comment o=\r\nn your post based on MY understanding of what your background is and what y=\r\nou are saying. Your mail is quite loaded and I will respond only to some sa=\r\nlient points in a freewheeling manner.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;My world view is slightly different. Aatman is that which is in ALL be=\r\nings and things as the non-dual and\n permanent reality. But we do not perce=\r\nive Aatman and perceive only the objects of the dual world, which are imper=\r\nmanent. However, the impermanent objects of this dual world too are made of=\r\n Aatman and non-different from Aatman. They do not consist of &quot;anaatman&quot; (n=\r\non-aatman) , but aatman only. Let me give an analogy.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;A ripple=\r\n in the pond is also part of pond and not non-pond. While the pond is stati=\r\nonary and permanent, the ripple is moving and transient. It will vanish aft=\r\ner a while and merge in the stationary pond. Some ripples die away too fast=\r\n and some take a very long time. Some transform from one structure to anoth=\r\ner before they vanish. But each ripple vanishes eventually and the pond rem=\r\nains in the place where there was a ripple once. As a matter of fact, even =\r\nwhen the ripple existed, one can still view it as the pond and not as a rip=\r\nple.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Aatman or Brahman described by Veda and Upanishad is like=\r\n the pond. All beings of the\n dual world that are perceivable to us are lik=\r\ne the ripples in the pond. They arise, they move, they get transformed into=\r\n different shapes, they interact with each other and get disturbed by each =\r\nother and eventually they slow down and vanish.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, we do not talk in terms of aatman and anaatman (non-aat=\r\nman) . We consider everything as aatman. However, some parts of imperishabl=\r\ne aatman seem perishable because of our way of looking, when our perspectiv=\r\ne is limited by duality.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The preservational and destructive as=\r\npects are both part of duality and non-dual aatman is free from all such co=\r\nnsiderations. Nothing is created or preserved or destroyed in aatman. But, =\r\nwhen one looks from a perspective that is limited by duality, it seems like=\r\n there are objects being created, preserved and\n destroyed.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;One gets liberation or moksha when one&#39;s perspect=\r\nive is not limited by the duality. Even when stuck in a ripple that feels l=\r\nike a violent whirlpool, if one can think &quot;I am the pond&quot; and act like it, =\r\nthen one is liberated. If a ripple is going to come hit the ripple one is i=\r\nn and disturb one&#39;s stability, if one can still think &quot;I am the pond&quot; and a=\r\nct like it, then one is liberated. Of course, I am talking in terms of the =\r\nanalogy I introduced earlier.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;When one is not liberated and on=\r\ne&#39;s perspective is clouded by duality, one experiences happiness, sadness, =\r\nlove, lust, hatred, anger, jealosy etc and various emotions. When one is li=\r\nberated and one&#39;s perspective is not limited by duality, one is filled with=\r\n great bliss. This was the goal of Buddha as well as Vedic\n rishis.&lt;BR&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Though rishis declared that everything is=\r\n Aatman and inability to recognize it is due to one&#39;s perspective being lim=\r\nited by duality, they did not leave it at that. They did not say &quot;this dual=\r\nity is nonsense or delusion or magic or anaatman. Just get over it&quot;, becaus=\r\ne getting over it is not easy. For one stuck in a whirlpool in a pond and p=\r\nanicking, the mere preaching &quot;ignore the whirlpool and think of the pond&quot; i=\r\ns useless.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;They prescribed various paths that are appropriate =\r\nfor people of various backgrounds to slowly get over duality. In fact, for =\r\npeople who do not want to get over duality and want to remain in it, manipu=\r\nlate it to their [temporary] advantage and enjoy it also, they prescribed v=\r\narious paths.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;The respect rishis showed to both non-dual Aatma=\r\nn AND the field of duality is perhaps unique to\n sanatana dharma and perhap=\r\ns missing in Buddhism.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Aghora is n=\r\not meant to be a path of addition to sex or drugs or pain. It is the path o=\r\nf seeing Aatman even in depraving conditions. If an aghori&#39;s focus of mind =\r\nwavers from the chosen deity and becomes aware of the body or its sense inp=\r\nuts, then he has failed badly. Only a sadhaka with a very high level of pur=\r\nity already is capable of testing himself/herself in depraving conditions a=\r\nnd see if they disturb the mental focus on god. As Svoboda correctly points=\r\n out at the beginning of his book on Aghora, the sadhakas who are pure enou=\r\ngh to succeed in Aghora practices usually are not attracted to Aghora and t=\r\nhose who find the practices attractive are usually not pure enough to succe=\r\ned in them.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;However, we cannot equate goddess worship to aghor=\r\na. Aghora is a set of extreme practices.\n Goddess worship has a wide range =\r\nof practices in India. Some worship the goddess without any &quot;self-destructi=\r\non&quot; or even self-deprivation and pursue rank materialism along with goddess=\r\n worship. Some worship goddess with varying levels of self-deprivation aime=\r\nd at slowly limiting the influence of sense inputs and considerations of se=\r\nnse pleasures/pains on the ability of the mind to focus on the Divine. Sana=\r\ntana dharma has a wide variety of practices that are appropriate for people=\r\n of various level of spiritual evolution and various degrees of internal pu=\r\nrity.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;But, given the wide variety =\r\nof teachings and practices available, people sometimes lap up the wrong tea=\r\nchings for them. For example, one person may claim &quot;I am Brahman, I am impe=\r\nrishable aatman, I am Buddha and I have to do no sadhana&quot;. A pretension or =\r\na mere academic statement is not a\n substitute for an internal *realization=\r\n* . If a terrible strife befalls, like a slow and painful death or a debili=\r\ntating disease or terrible injury, one may start saying &quot;I am in great pain=\r\n&quot;. Well, if one is Brahman, there is no pain or pleasure.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;One =\r\nshould realize that teachings relating to non-duality are inapplicable to m=\r\nost people and they need to do some sadhana to wade the field duality and r=\r\neach non-duality. In this light, we must appreciate the respectful treatmen=\r\nt of duality by rishis (who themselves had overcome it completely) and thei=\r\nr teaching of many tools to slowly wade it.&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;N=\r\narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n---------&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ ho=\r\nmam&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyo=\r\ntish lessons (MP3):\n http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre =\r\n(SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;--- In vedic-wis=\r\ndom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;jberger001&quot; &lt;jberger001@. ..&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nNamaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I recently joined this group after having been fo=\r\nrwarded some interesting posts by a colleague. As an introductory post, I w=\r\nould like to address a theme that is most pressing in my current worldview,=\r\n namely the problem of reconciling the preservational aspect of Atman with =\r\nwhat appears to be the dominance of a dark embrace between Anatman theory a=\r\nnd the Aghori path throughout most of the world. I don&#39;t think this is as s=\r\nimple as recongnizing that Shaivic and Vishnaivic energies are held in cons=\r\ntant balance, because the focus of the argument seems more oriented toward =\r\nan almost\n unconscious Kali worship among parts of the world in which Buddh=\r\nism is planting or has planted roots. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; For some time I hav=\r\ne struggled with the unsettling suspicion that Buddhism is a terrible trap =\r\nfor the mind to stumble upon. Ever since I heard a clip of U.G. Krishnamurt=\r\ni saying that Buddhism introduced the concept of conversion into the world,=\r\n and perhaps before, I have been plagued by this suspicion. It appears that=\r\n Anatman theory merely creates a a playground for various forms of absurdit=\r\ny which manifest themselves as a culture&#39;s obsession with sex and death, wh=\r\nich result in the economy of many parts of the world being driven by war an=\r\nd prostitution. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now the Aghori path is what is is for mos=\r\nt people: a path of self-destruction which is also a form of Goddess worshi=\r\np. But I would maintain that such naive practitioners of this path have use=\r\nd, consciously or unconsciously, the prevalent Anatman-related theories as\n=\r\n excuses to perpetuate the endless cycle of imperialism, heroin-trafficking=\r\n and prostitution that generally drives world economy. Because of this fata=\r\nl misunderstanding of Shaivic energies, along with the corresponding fascin=\r\nation with the lingo of Anatman theory, most of the world has become a wast=\r\neland of dispersed energy, prematurely sacrificed to Kali without a shred o=\r\nf taste or sophistication. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is here that I suppose one =\r\ncould get into some kind of nirvikalpa/savikalp a samadhi debate regarding =\r\nwhether the Buddha, by renouncing his family, actually created the disinteg=\r\nration of focus which is symbolic of the state of the world, in that Atman =\r\ntheory, represented by Hinduism is left holding down the homestead while An=\r\natman theory actually creates suffering by attempting to remove it through =\r\nmeditation. I would submit that the current state of world dharma locked in=\r\n some kind of identity crisis over who is supposed to be holding\n Kali&#39;s le=\r\nft leg and who the right. This is the essential problem, Shiva just lay the=\r\nre.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Thanks,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jeff Berger&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-531112200-1246218862=:59082--\r\n\n"}}
