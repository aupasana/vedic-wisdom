Anand Sagar Pathak\nSaturn which have been criticised, ridi=\r\nculed and condemned for ages for the suffering it bestows on mankind is mov=\r\ning ahead and is about to enter Cancer sign on 6th September 2004. \nWhat do=\r\nes it mean? What lies ahead? This will be the common concern for everybody.=\r\n \nDoes this Saturn affect everybody in the same way or it will affect diffe=\r\nrent person differently. The real analysis of life shows that the concerns =\r\nfor people are the same irrespective of their social status. The problems a=\r\nre linked with family, relations family and social security. However, Let&#39;s=\r\n understand how this transit will affect different rashis. Here by rashis w=\r\ne mean moon sign.\nNormally, when we take Saturn there are two dreaded trans=\r\nits of Saturn namely Sadhe Saati and Kantaka Shani (Dhaiya).\nIt is a known =\r\nfact that Saturn remains in a sign for approximately 2 and half years Sadhe=\r\n Saati means 7 and half. This period starts when Saturn enters into the 12t=\r\nh house from moon and ends when it leaves the second house from Moon. Kanta=\r\nka Shani starts when Saturn is placed in the 4th and the 8th house from the=\r\n Moon. Some astrologers include 10th house in the ambit of Dhaiya. \nAries: =\r\nThis transit will start the period of Kantaka shani . There can be some dis=\r\nturbance in the domestic life.There can be some shifts and change in reside=\r\nnce as well. \nTaurus: This will end the period of Sadhe Saati on them this =\r\nwill bring in lots of relief to the natives having Taurus moon sign. This w=\r\nill slowly ease out there problems. \nGemini: This will start the last phase=\r\n of Sadhe Saati for you. Though, there shall be some respite but still fina=\r\nnces shall cause lots of concern. \nCancer: Saturn is going to transit over =\r\nyour natal moon. There shall be increase in depression and mental tensions =\r\nduring this period. Some career related concern may crop up.\nLeo: This will=\r\n start the period of Sadhe Saati for you. There shall be sudden increase in=\r\n your expenditure. For some this may mean some change in residence or forei=\r\ngn travel. \nVirgo: There shall be gains for you. This is to prove that tran=\r\nsit of Saturn is not always bad. There shall be lots of financial gains for=\r\n you as well. \nLibra: The period will bring some anxious moments for your p=\r\nrofession. There can be some career related frustrations as well. There can=\r\n be some discomfort in your domestic setup as well. \nScorpio: This will bri=\r\nng in lots of relief for you as the period of Astam Shani will finally be o=\r\nver for you. There shall be gains from authorities. Some of you may be cont=\r\nemplating foreign travel as well.\nSagittarius: There can be some disturbanc=\r\ne in your life during this period. You should take special care towards you=\r\nr health during this period. Career may suffer during this period. \nCaprico=\r\nrn: There is a possibility of marriage for eligible bachelors. Professional=\r\nly, your period will be smooth. However, you have to really sweat a lot to =\r\nget good results.\nAquarius: This will bring in lots of respite for you. Thi=\r\ns transit will give you an edge over opponents. You will be able to repay y=\r\nour debts. Professionally, the time is favourable. However, health wise the=\r\n time is not all that conducive. \nPisces: This will end the period of Kanta=\r\nka Shani for you. Overall, this is an improvement in your life in general. =\r\nThis also means that there shall be some relaxation coming in your way afte=\r\nr a \n\n\nKantaka Sani means Saturn behaving like a thorn in the leg and the p=\r\nerson has to limp in all activities of life. Profession/Career is hampered =\r\nand finances dwindle. The transit of Saturn in the 1st, 4th, 8th and 10th s=\r\nigns either from Lagna, Arudha Lagna or the Moon sign cause Kantaka Sani to=\r\n operate. \nWhen it happens: \n1) With respect to Lagna, the person makes wro=\r\nng decisions and suffer due to that Lagna is our intelligence, our Dhi. \n2)=\r\n With respect to the AL, the career and finances are greatly affected becau=\r\nse Arudha lagna is shoving how society perceiving us. It is like reaction t=\r\noward the world, how you surround with the world. \n3) From Chandra, the per=\r\nson suffers physically and emotionally because Chandra is our Manas and als=\r\no represents the Sharira (body). \nWhen Shani is placed on Lagna, he is in M=\r\narana Karaka Sthana and it will destroy person&#39;s intelligence. When he tran=\r\nsit forth house the cure will be denied because the fourth house is the hou=\r\nse of healing. Shani in eight houses couses lot of transformation of the bo=\r\ndy. It is good for the healt. During that time is horrible, but after is ve=\r\nry good. It is like in story about Kurma Avatara and the time when Devas ar=\r\ne turning of the ocean. That is what&#39;s happend when Shani trasits eight hou=\r\nse. Lot of poison will come up but Amrita will also came in the end. So whe=\r\nn Shani is in eight house it couses all this problem in the body, and if th=\r\ne body if not strong person could die during that time. From there he aspec=\r\nts second house cousing bad food come into the body and a person eating wro=\r\nngly and it is aspecitng fifth house, person is doing wrong mantras and he =\r\naspects the tenth house, that is what is Kantak Shani. It is when he aspect=\r\ns tenth house. Then the persons Karma yoga is destroyed. That is why it is =\r\nworst transit. It is damaging all these other places and damaging the Karma=\r\n yoga. \n\n\n(Harih Om)\n\n\nshri shanaishchara stotram\n\n\nasya shri shanaishchara=\r\n stotrasya, dashratha rishih\n\nshanaishcharo devata, trishtup chandahah\n\nsha=\r\nnaishchara preetyarthe jape viniyogah\n\ndasharatha uvaacha\n\n\n\nkono-antako ro=\r\nudra-yama-tha babhruh \n\nkrishnah shanih pingala manda sourih \n\nnityam smrit=\r\no yo harate cha peeram \n\ntasmai namah shree ravi-nandanaya \n\n\n\nsura-asurah =\r\nkim purusho ragendra \n\ngandharva vidya dhara panna-gash cha \n\npeeryanti sar=\r\nve vishama-sthitena \n\ntasmai namah shree ravi-nandanaya \n\n\n\nnara narendrah =\r\npashavo mrigendra\n\nvanyascha ye kee ta patanga-bhringah \n\npeeryanti sarve v=\r\nishama-sthitena \n\ntasmai namah shree ravi-nandanaya \n\n\n\ndeshascha durgani v=\r\nanani Yatra\n\nsena-niveshah pura-pattanani \n\npeeryanti sarve visham-stitena =\r\n\n\ntasmai namah shree ravi-nandanaya \n\n\n\ntilairya-vair-masha gudanna danaih\n=\r\n\nlohena neelambara danato va \n\npreenati mantrair-nijavasare cha \n\ntasmai na=\r\nmah shree ravi-nandanaya \n\n\n\nprayaga-koole Yamuna tate cha\n\nsarasvati punya=\r\n-jale guhayaam \n\nyo yoginam dhyana-gatopi sookshmah\n\ntasmai namah shree rav=\r\ni-nandanaya \n\n\n\nanya-pradeshat swagriham pravishtah\n\ntadeeya-vare sa narah =\r\nsukhesya \n\ngrihad gato yo na punah prayati \n\ntasmai namah sri ravi-nandanay=\r\na \n\n\n\nsrashta swayam-bhoor bhuvana trayasya\n\ntrata hareesho harate pinakee =\r\n\n\nekas tridhah rig yajuh sama murtih\n\ntasmai namah sri ravi-nandanaya \n\n\n\ns=\r\nhanyash takam yah prayatah prabhate\n\nnityam suputraih pashubaandha vaish ch=\r\na\n\npathettu saukhyam bhuvi bho gayuktah\n\npraapnoti nirvaa napadam tadante\n\n=\r\n\n\nkonasthah pingala babruh\n\nkrishno roudrontako yamah \n\nsaurih shanaish-cha=\r\nro mandah \n\npippalandena samstu tah \n\n\n\netani dasha-namani\n\nprata rutthaya =\r\nyah patheh\n\nshanaishchara-krita peera \n\nna kadachid bhavishyati\n\n\n(Harih Om=\r\n)\n\n&lt;table border=3D0 style=3D&quot;background-color: #fff; padding: 5px;&quot; cellsp=\r\nacing=3D0&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;\n  &lt;img src=3D&quot;http://groups.google.com/groups/img/3nb=\r\n/groups_bar.gif&quot;\n         height=3D26 width=3D132 alt=3D&quot;Google Groups&quot;&gt;\n  =\r\n&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;padding-left: 5px&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;b&gt;Subscribe to Astro h=\r\nelp&lt;/b&gt;\n  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n  &lt;form action=3D&quot;http://groups.google.com/group/astro=\r\n-help-/boxsubscribe&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;tr&gt;&lt;td style=3D&quot;padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;\n  Email: &lt;inp=\r\nut type=3Dtext name=3Demail&gt;\n  &lt;input type=3Dsubmit name=3D&quot;sub&quot; value=3D&quot;S=\r\nubscribe&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/form&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td align=3Dright&gt;\n  &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://=\r\ngroups.google.com/group/astro-help-&quot;&gt;Visit this group&lt;/a&gt;\n&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;\n&lt;/tabl=\r\ne&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
