Cessation of Ahamkar=\r\na and purity seems to be only required in the initial stages when you are s=\r\ntill struggling to acquire a steady mind needed for mantra sadhana success.=\r\n Once you have achieved some level of success, discipline that may have bee=\r\nn required in the initial stages is no longer necessary.\n=C2=A0\nI have read=\r\n a few of Sivanandas books....most of them are available on their website f=\r\nor free downloads as pdf. And what he has stated is that to develop a stead=\r\ny mind, strict discipline is necessary on food and detachment from sexual a=\r\nctivity as would be=C2=A0in celibacy. Once you have been able to steady you=\r\n mind, you may give up this discipline. If you look at the case of Ravana, =\r\nhe did a lot of penance while he was young. The arrogant and cruel Ravana t=\r\nhat people thing of him today is essentially part of his adult life.....onc=\r\ne he had already perfected his ability to concentrate. But why look at Rava=\r\nna alone. You read any mythology, purana or granth and you will come across=\r\n Rishi&#39;s who are supposed to be pious and humble, but they=C2=A0seem to be =\r\never ready to curse anybody even with a slightest disappointment, most of t=\r\nhem seemed to have big egos.\n=C2=A0\nI do not know if you have read the Agho=\r\nra books on Vimalananda,=C2=A0 but if you read that, even when Vimalananda =\r\ntalks of giving up ego, he or his gurus did not like being challenged on an=\r\ny matter and this is time and again=C2=A0seen in his books.\n=C2=A0\nOfcourse=\r\n above all, you need to keep your ego in control before the Lord even thoug=\r\nh you may be reckless to other humans. There is someone I know....I do not =\r\nknow him personally but only through message exchanges over groups like thi=\r\ns. He seems to have knowledge of a lot of sadhana&#39;s and has practiced quite=\r\n a lot of them. Success seems to illude him though. According to him, when =\r\nhe does sadhana for others, it succeeds immediately but not when he does th=\r\nis for himself. And he was once=C2=A0asking everybody and anybody to help h=\r\nim out with the situation. I really do not know much about the various sadh=\r\nanas for achieving specific needs. So I suggested that instead of of asking=\r\n for suggestions of different sadhana from everybody, why does he not just =\r\ntell the lord in his prayer one day that the effects of his bad karmas are =\r\ngetting too much to bear and if the Lord could provide him the success he i=\r\ns looking for in his life. He retorted and shot back at me that\n he did not=\r\n spend time and energy in learning these various tantric sadhanas just to b=\r\neg before god, he only knows how to demand from god.! I reminded him that a=\r\nll this while, he was not having any problems begging for help and suggesti=\r\non from other group members and yet, he is not willing to beg from god when=\r\n really god is the one and only who can really do anything the problems he =\r\nis facing. I do not think even Ravana had that attitude that this person di=\r\nd,=C2=A0when he would sit down for his sadhana.\n=C2=A0\nCheers,\nBhupendra\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\nFrom: silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com\nSent: Mon, November 15, 2010 11:44:16 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdo=\r\nm] Re: Success with Mantras\n\n=C2=A0 \n\nNamaskar,\nHow did Ravana got success =\r\nwith Mantras if success with Mantras comes only with loss of Ahamkara and p=\r\nurity of mind ?\nWhere is the liberation without shakti, even the slaves wer=\r\ne humble, devoted and with complete surrender to their masters, what result=\r\ns did they ever get ?\nThere is a saying in sanskrit, &quot;Kshama shobhti us bhu=\r\njang ko jiske paas garal ho, usko kya jo dant heen vishrahit vineet saral h=\r\no&quot;.

If one worries too much about the beauty and technical d=\r\netails of the stick and ends up putting stress on the leg, the stick does n=\r\not serve its purpose. The stick is helpful only if you consciously spare th=\r\ne leg from effort. Once the leg cures, you can then not only walk but also =\r\nrun. Similarly, a lot of technical details of the mantra do not matter much=\r\n.

Cessation of Ahamkara and purity seems to be o=\r\nnly required in the initial stages when you are still struggling to acquire=\r\n a steady mind needed for mantra sadhana success. Once you have achieved so=\r\nme level of success, discipline that may have been required in the initial =\r\nstages is no longer necessary.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I have read a f=\r\new of Sivanandas books....most of them are available on their website for f=\r\nree downloads as pdf. And what he has stated is that to develop a steady mi=\r\nnd, strict discipline is necessary on food and detachment from sexual activ=\r\nity as would be&nbsp;in celibacy. Once you have been able to steady you min=\r\nd, you may give up this discipline. If you look at the case of Ravana, he d=\r\nid a lot of penance while he was young. The arrogant and cruel Ravana that =\r\npeople thing of him today is essentially part of his adult life.....once he=\r\n had already perfected his ability to concentrate. But why look at Ravana a=\r\nlone. You read any mythology, purana or granth and you will come across Ris=\r\nhi&#39;s who are supposed to be pious and humble, but they&nbsp;seem to be ever=\r\n ready to curse anybody even with a slightest disappointment, most of them =\r\nseemed to have big egos.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I do not know if you =\r\nhave read the Aghora books on Vimalananda,&nbsp; but if you read that, even=\r\n when Vimalananda talks of giving up ego, he or his gurus did not like bein=\r\ng challenged on any matter and this is time and again&nbsp;seen in his book=\r\ns.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Ofcourse above all, you need to keep your e=\r\ngo in control before the Lord even though you may be reckless to other huma=\r\nns. There is someone I know....I do not know him personally but only throug=\r\nh message exchanges over groups like this. He seems to have knowledge of a =\r\nlot of sadhana&#39;s and has practiced quite a lot of them. Success seems to il=\r\nlude him though. According to him, when he does sadhana for others, it succ=\r\needs immediately but not when he does this for himself. And he was once&nbs=\r\np;asking everybody and anybody to help him out with the situation. I really=\r\n do not know much about the various sadhanas for achieving specific needs. =\r\nSo I suggested that instead of of asking for suggestions of different sadha=\r\nna from everybody, why does he not just tell the lord in his prayer one day=\r\n that the effects of his bad karmas are getting too much to bear and if the=\r\n Lord could provide him the success he is looking for in his life. He retor=\r\nted and shot back at\n me that he did not spend time and energy in learning =\r\nthese various tantric sadhanas just to beg before god, he only knows how to=\r\n demand from god.! I reminded him that all this while, he was not having an=\r\ny problems begging for help and suggestion from other group members and yet=\r\n, he is not willing to beg from god when really god is the one and only who=\r\n can really do anything the problems he is facing. I do not think even Rava=\r\nna had that attitude that this person did,&nbsp;when he would sit down for =\r\nhis sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Cheers,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Bhupendra&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; F=\r\nONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #1010ff 2px solid; FONT-FAM=\r\nILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=\r\n=3D2 face=3DTahoma&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From=\r\n:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPA=\r\nN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Mon, November 15, 2=\r\n010 11:44:16 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Re: Success with Mantras&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; =\r\n\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1829118249yiv1959359882ygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaskar,&lt;BR&gt;How did R=\r\navana got success with Mantras if success with Mantras comes only with loss=\r\n of Ahamkara and purity of mind ?&lt;BR&gt;Where is the liberation without shakti=\r\n, even the slaves were humble, devoted and with complete surrender to their=\r\n masters, what results did they ever get ?&lt;BR&gt;There is a saying in sanskrit=\r\n, &quot;Kshama shobhti us bhujang ko jiske paas garal ho, usko kya jo dant heen =\r\nvishrahit vineet saral ho&quot;.

Jay-ji. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Is it possible, Jay-ji, that we have a few simple mantras listed for the=\r\n benefit of the members to address the common issues people face, plus to a=\r\nppease the lords of the houses (like Ganesha for ketu, Durga for rahu, Bala=\r\nji for saturn etc). Mr. PVRji has listed some, but would be good to develop=\r\n such list and make them available in one place. I truly believe that would=\r\n be more useful and powerful than\n prescribing remedies which may or may no=\r\nt work(with possible high degree of error possibilities in the charts).
