If you are doing\ndifferent mantras for different purposes (e.g. marital bliss, children,\nmoney, job etc), it is ok to do many mantras. But, for spiritual progress,\nit is better to leave everything else and get hold of just one mantra.\n\nIf you pray to any god to the best of your ability, using the best procedure\nto *your knowledge*, without any expectations, then it is *never* a wrong\nthing to do. Learn to love god, learn to ask god to help you overcome ego,\nlearn to *not* ask god for petty and impermanent things and learn to not\nfear god or worship.\n\nIn my judgment, Shiva or Dattatreya are the best for you. Stick to a guru\nform of god.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; Dear Sir,\n&gt; This article has given me a lot of hope.\n&gt; Sir I learned trancendental meditation  when i was in 8th class.I\n&gt; practised it for some time.During college years i read the Mahabharat\n&gt; and many other religious texts.I always did daily puja with a lot of\n&gt; bhakti.\n&gt; Three years ago, i met Vashisthji in Gondia--He is a retired officer\n&gt; of the irrigation department--He thaught me the basics .\n&gt; of astrology.He also guided me to do jaap.During navrati i did jaap of\n&gt; devi&#39;s navarn mantra.Then during saawan month i did jaap of shiva&#39;s\n&gt; panchakshari mantra.Last chaitra navratri i did gayatri jaap and again\n&gt; this shravan i did Shiva&#39;s jaap.\n&gt; But all this was done without any nyas or any of the other things\n&gt; that you have mentioned.I always wondered whether what i was doing was\n&gt; right, but still went ahead thinking that taking Gods name cannot be\n&gt; wrong.Also all these jaap were done without asking for anything in\n&gt; return.Am i right ?I dont know sanskrit so though i have so many books\n&gt; i am unable to learn from them.\n&gt;  Also from sometime i have been thinking that it might be better if i\n&gt; stuck to one mantra rather than doing so many different ones.I would\n&gt; be greatfull to you.Please help me.\n&gt; My dob is 28 nov. 1967;pob is mumbai;and tob is 8.20am.\n&gt; sorry about the lenth of this mail,but quite frankly i could go on and on.\n&gt; Thank you and waiting for your reply.\n&gt;                             Sunita.\n\n\n"}}
