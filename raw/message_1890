Free will=\r\n is restricted to the\n&gt; &gt; amount of freedom the rope allows one.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Ra=\r\nmakrishna is a master of explaining the toughest of philosophical points us=\r\ning the simplest of analogies. His analogies are usually quite apt and bril=\r\nliant.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Yes, karma or destiny (i.e. the result of past actions) is l=\r\nike a rope tied to the neck of a goat. The rope restricts the movement of t=\r\nhe goat, but does not determine where the goat goes and what it does! That =\r\nis upto the goat&#39;s free will.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; A thirsty goat may look at a river ne=\r\narby and despair as it cannot reach the river due to the rope. It may try a=\r\nnd struggle continually, without reaching the river. Another thirsty goat m=\r\nay realize that it cannot reach the river, accept that, look around, find a=\r\n small bucket of water behind it within reach if it negotiates with the rop=\r\ne and the obstacles. It may turn back, go, drink that water in the bucket a=\r\nnd be happy.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; While the destiny as frozen at the time of birth (and =\r\nas reflected in the horoscope) is like the rope tying the goat and=A0the su=\r\nrroundings of the goat, the actions of free will after birth are like the a=\r\nctions of the goat - how it accepts and negotiates the rope and its surroun=\r\ndings to get what it wants.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Today&#39;s actions (karma) are tomorrow&#39;s destiny (karma).=\r\n Some of today&#39;s actions may impact destiny in a future life. Some of today=\r\n&#39;s actions may modify destiny for tomorrow (in this life itself!). Let me e=\r\nxtend Ramakrishna&#39; s analogy to explain it.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; A goat tied to a tree w=\r\nith a rope may go around the tree a few times in one direction and the rope=\r\n may get shorter. It may now be unable to reach places it was able to reach=\r\n earlier. Similarly, some bad acts of free will in this life may tighten th=\r\ne destiny, make things worse and reduce one&#39;s options.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; It may go=\r\n around the tree a few times in another direction and the rope may get long=\r\ner. It may now be able to reach places it was unable to reach earlier. Simi=\r\nlarly, some good acts of free will in this life may improve the destiny and=\r\n make more things possible.\n&gt; =A0*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; One&#39;s mind is conditioned based on one&#39;s destiny. One&#39;s su=\r\nrroundings and life situations faced by one are influenced by one&#39;s destint=\r\ny. One will be pulled in certain directions. One may feel attraction for=A0=\r\nanother person. Another person may hate one an, abuse one and throw obstacl=\r\nes. One may not have enough money to live happily. One may be adored by mil=\r\nlions of people. And so on. One faces different life situations at differen=\r\nt times and=A0in different matters.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; However, destiny only shows how=\r\n one (and one&#39;s mind) is pulled in various directions and what life situati=\r\nons one finds oneself in. Irrespective of the mental conditioning and one&#39;s=\r\n circumstances, one can still choose between different actions. The actions=\r\n taken by one are not fixed based on the horoscope. For example, one person=\r\n may abuse one badly and one may feel great anger towards that person, all =\r\non account of a previous karmik debt. But, when badly provoked, one can eit=\r\nher succumb to the temptation and fight back or just ignore and move on.\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; Destiny places you in different situations. What you do in those situ=\r\nations is based on how you use your free will. In some cases, free will has=\r\n a lot of wiggle room and many options and, in some cases, it has fewer opt=\r\nions. But, usually, you do have several options that may or may not be obvi=\r\nous and the action you finally choose shapes your destiny in a future birth=\r\n.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Please no=\r\nte that the Sanskrit word for destiny is karma and the Sanskrit word for ac=\r\ntion is also karma. Basically, actions of today become destiny of tomorrow.=\r\n You will get reaction in future to your current actions and destiny is the=\r\n sum total of those actions that will come back to you.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Each action=\r\n of yours that impacts other beings and objects of this universe will go to=\r\nwards forming your destiny for future. (Here please note that both physical=\r\n and mental actions count. Any emotions you feel towards someone else and d=\r\no not necessary express outwardly=A0will also impact that person in a subtl=\r\ne manner and hence counts as an action.)\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Horoscope captures the goo=\r\nd and bad actions, committed physically or mentally to other beings, until =\r\nthe current birth, which are to give their reactions in this life. This is =\r\nalso known as destiny.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; It does not fix what you do in various situa=\r\ntions in your current life. You have the ability to make different choices =\r\nat important crossroads. The choices you make are your karma (actions) and =\r\nthey shape your destiny for future. They may either impact your current lif=\r\ne itself, or become part of the destiny (as reflected in the horoscope) in =\r\nthe next life.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; Anybody who tells you that so and so houses show acts of free will do=\r\nes not understand what=A0free will is.

Acts of free will are like how the goat negotiates the rope and mov=\r\nes around within the possible area=A0to do its stuff. That is in the hands =\r\nof the goat.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The scope and options available to free will can be es=\r\ntimated from the horoscope, but the exact acts of free will are unpredictab=\r\nle based on horoscope. To complicate things further, how exactly free will =\r\nhas been used until now in this life=A0(which cannot be seen from the horos=\r\ncope) has an impact on the scope and options available to free will at this=\r\n time. The exertion of free will until now may have modified the destiny.\n&gt;=\r\n =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I am not dow=\r\nnplaying astrology. Going back to the original Chiranjeevi prediction, the =\r\nprediction that he would come into politics in 2007-2009 and enjoy some kin=\r\nd of power was made using astrology. When someone is already a=A0candidate,=\r\n even a random prediction of success or failure has a 1/2 or 1/3 probabilit=\r\ny. But, when there are no signs on the ground, a prediction on one&#39;s politi=\r\ncal entry in a specific timeframe has a very low probability. Such a low pr=\r\nobability prediction made 7 years ahead using astrology came true. Moreover=\r\n, we have all seen many cases where astrology worked spectacularly. I am no=\r\nt saying astrology is nonsense. But I am saying that we do not attempt to u=\r\nnderstand its shortcomings.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; When someone&#39;s free will works in a pre=\r\ndictable way, i.e. when one&#39;s free will has very few options and/or one rea=\r\ncts to life situations thrown up by the destiny in predictable ways, job of=\r\n an astrologer is easier. But, when free will has a wide range of options a=\r\nnd/or one used the free will powerfully, the gap between the destiny as ref=\r\nlected by horoscope and the actual destiny as a result of those actions may=\r\n make an astrologer fail.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; Do a Short Ho=\r\nmam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yo=\r\nurself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://gro=\r\nups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ve=\r\ndicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.V=\r\nedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJag=\r\nan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; --- On Wed, 5/27/09, Shyam V.

A=\r\nt the time of that prediction, there were no such indications on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nthe ground. But he did come into politics in the same timeframe. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; initial talk was in 2007, he finally formed a party in 2008 and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; elections were in 2009.

But sometimes we make bad\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions with good da=\r\nta too. Of course, it can be a human error in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; judging various fac=\r\ntors. However, that human error seems to be a little\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more common =\r\nin high profile political predictions than in regular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predictions=\r\n. What could be the reason?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wonder if the factor =\r\nof free will that is left out of astrology\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; plays a bigger role in=\r\n political charts. I will try to think loud and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; elaborate what I =\r\nmean.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One&#39;s birth cha=\r\nrt contains the list of actions committed in previous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lives using=\r\n one&#39;s free will that are to give their reactions in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life. H=\r\nowever, as life goes on, one accumulates newer actions committed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nin THIS life using one&#39;s free will. What happens at any point of time in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s life is a function of ALL actions committed by one until that=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; point of time, INCLUDING the actions committed in THIS life unti=\r\nl now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some key actions committed using one&#39;s free will in THIS l=\r\nife,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; especially at important crossroads in life, should impact th=\r\ne life\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events from then onwards.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many peo=\r\nple are weighed down by too many karmas and always playing a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; catc=\r\nhup. In other words, destiny (sum of the actions of previous lives\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; which are to give a reaction now) is too weighty and free will in this\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life has little scope. When the options available for the free will=\r\n in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this life are limited, there may not be significant actions u=\r\nsing free\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will and hence the modifications to destiny based on ac=\r\ntions of this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life may not be big enough. Thus, horoscope may be =\r\nsufficient to predict\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; events.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, hi=\r\nghly popular, successful and high profile public\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personalities ma=\r\ny have less restrictions and more options available for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their fre=\r\ne will. With their free will being more free and powerful, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ac=\r\ntions committed by their free will may have a higher weightage. As we\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; are able to see only their destiny in the horoscope (free will exercis=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; upto birth) and unable to factor in how free will was exercised=\r\n in this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; life until now, we are perhaps handicapped in our predic=\r\ntions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether a political leader is in limelight a=\r\nnd becomes MP or the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; leader of opposition in parliament or the Pr=\r\nime Minister, he is enjoying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some political power. Previous karma=\r\ns placed him in a position to enjoy\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that power. To predict the sp=\r\necific degree of power and make an accurate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prediction, is the ho=\r\nroscope sufficient always? Could the exercise of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; free will in thi=\r\ns life until now make a difference in some high profile\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; charts?\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am just thinking lou=\r\nd here. Rather than posing a question and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; answering it myself, I =\r\nwill let learned friends ponder on this for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves.. .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear PVR garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you don&#39;t mind, could you pleas=\r\ne look in to why your prediction on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chiranjeevi failed ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not asking this question with a wrong intent. I wanted=\r\n to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) It is a human error (May be you =\r\nignored some data ? )\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) You still can&#39;t understand why it fail=\r\ned and you think that was the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; correct prediction to be best of yo=\r\nur knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I had a 50-50 faith on astrology 3 ye=\r\nars ago and after coming to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about you / your lessons I devel=\r\noped strong faith and I thought all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; failures are not because =\r\nof astrology but because of astrologer&#39;s lack\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If it is case #1, it is okay.
