In them medical sciences and material sciences are researched\ninto scientifically. Great scientists right from the discovery of penicillin\nto a test tube baby have persevered hard to serve mankind in an amazing\nmanner. They have lived lives akin to that of great saints, sages and Rishis\nwho were known for their penance and austerities. Many research papers have\nbeen published and many more will be published in future. Every scientist\nwhile taking up a research project accepts in his/her heart of hearts that\ntheirs is a humble effort. They may face disappointment or attain their goal\nafter undergoing many failed experiments. Thus each scientist like a sports\nperson takes up scientific projects gamely. Scientific research is nothing\nbut a spiritual endeavor. Their underling aim is nothing but service to\nworld humanity/beings. But alas that seriousness and focus shown towards\nresearch of material science was not shown towards proving the scientific\nnature of spiritual principles by modern day scientists. It serves no\npurpose by either eulogizing or demeaning spiritual precepts in a\nsuperficial manner. It is hence that Brahmavarchas Research Institute took\nup this onerous task of testing ancient spiritual tenets in well equipped\nscientific research laboratories. We have realized that without giving\nscientific proof of the great importance of spirituality no one in this\nmodern age of information technology is going to imbibe it. Thus the world\nwill miss at their own peril great spiritual principles that can uplift\nworld humanity both materially and spiritually.\n\nWithin this realm stray and scattered efforts have been made. Special\nemphasis has been laid on Parapsychology. In the western world the\nscientific basis of Extrasensory Potential (ESP) hearing sounds from great\ndistances, seeing things at great distances etc is being researched into on\na very gigantic scale. If the aim is merely idle curiosity the principle can\nnever be understood deeply. Indian Spirituality not only proclaims the\npowerful nature of such capabilities but has also elucidated well designed\nmethods (Yoga etc) that basically cover spiritual practices (Sadhana). In\nreality this arena is very widespread. The mysterious subtle layers of the\nhuman body and the wondrous aspects of this gigantic cosmos stand before us\nwith infinite aspects of research. The need of the hour today is to place it\nin front of world humanity using sound logic, precepts and scientific proof.\nOur Brahmavarchas Research Institute has taken up this great challenge and\nwill prove the same after intense experimentation and research studies.\n\n\n Author:  Pt shriram Sharma Acharyaji\n\n-- \nThank you and Have a Fulfilling Day\n\nVenkat Koppaka\n\r\n--0015175cddd845e52d04701fc41b\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Dear ALL,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;By itself there are scores of research laboratories all over the world.
