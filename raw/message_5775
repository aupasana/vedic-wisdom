Or you can also dr=\r\naw a more elaborate yantra with kumkum at the \n&gt; base of the=C2=A0kunda. If=\r\n you are using=C2=A0yantra, then it is best to use the right \n&gt; yantra for =\r\nthe specific deity. Or else it may not have any perceivable=C2=A0effect. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; At a basic level one can use a simple upward pointed triangle for an=\r\ny male deity \n&gt; and a downward pointed one for a female deity. Make it usin=\r\ng 9 sticks. 3 on each \n&gt; side. Another simple yantra is to make a 6 pointed=\r\n star with 12 sticks.=C2=A0A base \n&gt; triangle with an inverted triangle on =\r\ntop, repeated again. (3 x 4 =3D 12).\n&gt; \n&gt; Fire itself is very powerful. Wit=\r\nhout a yantra too it works fine (my=C2=A0personal \n&gt; opinion). To be able t=\r\no really use the yantra as a prop to invoke the deity, one \n&gt; must=C2=A0be =\r\nsufficiently engaged in using the yantra for=C2=A0years.
