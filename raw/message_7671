Some people worship C=\r\nhandi in a four\nhanded form as well. But think, does the description of the=\r\n vairkritikam\nrahasya actually paint a complete picture of Her? It leaves a=\r\n lot to\nyour imagination, doesn&#39;t it. Buddhists also worship Chandi , in so=\r\nme\nsects. She is called the mother of 7000 Buddhas of all universes. But\nth=\r\ne Thangka paintings of Chandi all have very typical Tibetian/Chinese\nface. =\r\nThats the way they have imagined her.\n&gt;\n&gt; To understand this try and unders=\r\ntand what is a form of a deity, any\ndeity. You see the image of Durga ridin=\r\ng a lion. The lion that we paint\nand make is the pantera leo, a lifeform th=\r\nat came into existence through\nthe process of evolution a million years ago=\r\n. This evolved from an\nearlier form of a=C2 prehistoric=C2 lion with larger=\r\n and scarier=C2\nfangs. Why don&#39;t we use the earlier imagery of the lion in =\r\nour pictures?\nThe energy of Durga is called eternal, but the entity of the =\r\nlion\nevolved at a fixed point in history. How did that form become her\nvehi=\r\ncle? Even the weapons she uses are humanly evolved with time? What\nhappened=\r\n before these came into existence?\n&gt;\n&gt; A deity is a cosmic energy, and in t=\r\nhe field of duality it has some\nattributes. Internally it is connected to t=\r\nhe supreme, unspeakable,\nnameless entity which is impossible for the averag=\r\ne human mind to\nimagine even remotely. Some specific qualities of that unsp=\r\neakable,=C2\npurely transcendental=C2 energy are manifested in certain fashi=\r\nons\nthrough archetypical cosmic energies which we call deities. The\nforms/i=\r\nconographies that we attribute to the=C2 deities are symbolic of\nthese qual=\r\nities. For example, we can&#39;t see magnetic lines of force, but\nif you keep i=\r\nron-fillings, they can create a pattern and give the\nimpression of a shape.=\r\n=C2 When perception is very subtle, due to purity\nof the internal nadis, th=\r\nen the energy can manifest as a form which has\nbeen created as a symbolic=\r\n=C2 aggregate of its different attributes.\nThus each aspect of the iconogra=\r\nphy is a representation of some quality.\nThe lion represents strength, powe=\r\nr, raw courage, confidence and\nfearlessness.\n&gt;  Exactly the qualities that =\r\na sadhaka will imbibe when he/she keeps\nsuccessfully=C2 meditating on the i=\r\nconography of Durga. Similarly=C2\nChamunda is savasana, sitting on a corpse=\r\n. Die to the material world you\nmust, if you have to=C2 become Her vehicle.=\r\n=C2  And when you raise=C2\nyour awareness to the shahasrar, then you can=C2=\r\n percieve these\ncosmic=C2 energies without any attributes any more. But unt=\r\nill you have\nthe ability to reach that state of consciousness, it is mere t=\r\nheory with\nzero real value.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; So what the Rahasya explains is the basic=\r\n fundamental iconographic=C2\noutline of Mahalakshmi. The plethora of weapon=\r\ns are precisely because\nher chief quality as manifested in the world of dua=\r\nlity in a war-like\nferocity.\n&gt; Not everybody who does the Chandi path may h=\r\nave a connection with this\niconography. Infact, most people don&#39;t. Some may=\r\n have a connection with\nanother iconography. The Chandipaath contains a who=\r\nle galaxy of\niconographies. This is where one needs guidance in pinpointing=\r\n the exact\nform unfailingly, which will cause faster spiritual evolution.\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n________________________________________________________________________=\r\n&#92;\n_______________\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The distinction between ferocious forms and non-fer=\r\nocious forms is not\na creation of some. It is the way it is, and has been r=\r\neconfirmed over\nand over by people who have realized the different forms in=\r\n the field of\nduality. If the iconography of a deity holds a weapon, it is =\r\nnot for\nshow purposes. And if it holds plenty of weapons, then there are pl=\r\nenty\nof good reasons where=C2 he/she amply uses them. If you worship Smasha=\r\nn\nKali at home, She will make the area you live in into a smashan, whether\n=\r\nyou want it or not. Some opine that the smashana is merely=C2 in the\nheart =\r\nof the sadhaka, and She is not really that fierce. This is solid\nmisunderst=\r\nanding based on a bookish understanding superimposed with\nVedanata type thi=\r\nnking. Where the smashana will be created for Kaali\ndepends on your persona=\r\nl conditioning. If you are continuously living in\nperfectly universal condi=\r\ntion, unattached to anything, THEN you\nliterally ARE the Universe. Then the=\r\n smashana is only\n&gt;  inside your heart, which in that case has become the w=\r\nhole world.=C2\nElse, for the rest whose minds still firmly work in the fiel=\r\nd of\nduality, the smashana is both outside and inside, depending on the\ndeg=\r\nree of connection the person has to the universal. Smashana Tara told\nVimal=\r\nananda that she cannot come to his home, he has to go to the\nsmashana every=\r\n night. Thats the way it is. Similarly, an ugra form\nis=C2 actually ferocio=\r\nus. A soumya form is actually non-ferocious.=C2\nSome will love the former, =\r\nsome will love the later. Chandi, the very\nname, comes from the root word &quot;=\r\nchand&quot;, which is also the root word for\nChandala. One who does not follow r=\r\nules, cannot be made to confirm to\nany rule, breaks down rules and restrict=\r\nions.=C2 This derivation is\nmentioned in some of the texts on Chandi sadhan=\r\na. That gives a slight\nhint of what kind of energy She manifests.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Rega=\r\nrds\n&gt; =C2 Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: om.namona=\r\nrayana chamundayevicce@...\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Wedne=\r\nsday, 21 December 2011 7:30 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you for your kind sharing of your kno=\r\nwledge on Chandi with the\ngroup.\n&gt;\n&gt; How does this person&#39;s vision impact t=\r\nhe description mentioned in\nvaiktikarahasyam?\n&gt; Isn&#39;t this used in the dhya=\r\nnam for the invocation of Chandi in the\nhomam manual.\n&gt;\n&gt; Question here is;=\r\n should we follow the actual vision or the\ndescription mentioned for the vi=\r\nsualization?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you.\n&gt; ***\n&gt; =C5=9Bv=EF=BF=BD&quot;t=C4=81nan=C4=81 n=C4=\r\n=ABlabhuj=C4=81 su=C5=9Bv=EF=BF=BD&quot;ta\nstana ma=E1=B9=87dal=C4=81 |\n&gt; rakta =\r\nmadhy=C4=81 rakta p=C4=81d=C4=81 n=C4=ABla\nja=E1=B9=85gh=C5=8Drurunmad=C4=\r\n=81 || 8 ||\n&gt; suchitra ja.ghan=C4=81 chitra m=C4=81ly=C4=81m bara\nvibh=C5=\r\n=AB=C5=9Ba=E1=B9=87=C4=81 |\n&gt; chitr=C4=81 nul=EF=BF=BD&quot;pan=C4=81 k=C4=81nti=\r\n r=C5=ABpa saubh=C4=81gya\n=C5=9B=C4=81lin=C4=AB || 9 ||\n&gt; a=C5=9B=E1=B9=AD=\r\n=C4=81 da=C5=9Ba bhuj=C4=81 p=C5=AB.jy=C4=81 s=C4=81 sahasra\nbhuj=C4=81 sat=\r\n=C4=AB |\n&gt; =C4=81yu.dh=C4=81nyatra vak=C5=9Byant=EF=BF=BD&quot;\ndak=E1=B9=A3i=E1=\r\n=B9=87=C4=81dha=E1=B8=A5 kara kram=C4=81t || 10 ||\n&gt; ak=E1=B9=A3m=C4=81l=C4=\r\n=81 ca kamala=E1=B9=83 ba=E1=B9=87=C5=8D.si=E1=B8=A5\nkuli=C5=9Ba=E1=B9=83 g=\r\nad=C4=81 |\n&gt; cakra=E1=B9=83 tri=C5=9B=C5=ABla=E1=B9=83 para=C5=9B=C5=AB=E1=\r\n=B8=A5\n=C5=9Ba=E1=B9=85kh=C5=8D gha=E1=B9=87=E1=B9=AD=C4=81 ca p=C4=81=C5=\r\n=9Baka=E1=B8=A5 || 11 ||\n&gt; =C5=9Baktirda=E1=B9=87da=C5=9Bcarma c=C4=81pa=E1=\r\n=B9=83\np=C4=81nap=C4=81tra=E1=B9=83 kama=E1=B9=87dalu=E1=B8=A5 |\n&gt; ala=E1=\r\n=B9=83k=E1=B9=9Bta bhuj=C4=81m=EF=BF=BD&quot;bhir=C4=81yudhai=E1=B8=A5\nkamal=C4=\r\n=81san=C4=81m || 12 ||\n&gt; ***--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi n=\r\nandy rajarshi14@\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; =EF=BF=BD=C2\n&gt; &gt; There are no =\r\naccurate pictures of Ma Chandi.

That gives a s=\r\nlight hint of what kind of energy She manifests.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; _______________________=\r\n_________&lt;br&gt;&gt; From: om.namonarayana chamundayevicce@...&lt;br&gt;&gt; To: ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, 21 December 2011 7:30 A=\r\nM&lt;br&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C2&=\r\nnbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Thank y=\r\nou for your kind sharing of your knowledge on Chandi with the group.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; How does this person&#39;s vision impact the description mentioned i=\r\nn vaiktikarahasyam?&lt;br&gt;&gt; Isn&#39;t this used in the dhyanam for the invocati=\r\non of Chandi in the homam manual.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Question here is; should=\r\n we follow the actual vision or the description mentioned for the visualiza=\r\ntion?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Thank you.&lt;br&gt;&gt; ***&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C5=9Bv=EF=BF=BD&quot;t=C4=\r\n=81nan=C4=81 n=C4=ABlabhuj=C4=81 su=C5=9Bv=EF=BF=BD&quot;ta stana ma=E1=B9=87dal=\r\n=C4=81 |&lt;br&gt;&gt; rakta madhy=C4=81 rakta p=C4=81d=C4=81 n=C4=ABla ja=E1=B9=\r\n=85gh=C5=8Drurunmad=C4=81 || 8 ||&lt;br&gt;&gt; suchitra ja.ghan=C4=81 chitra m=\r\n=C4=81ly=C4=81m bara vibh=C5=AB=C5=9Ba=E1=B9=87=C4=81 |&lt;br&gt;&gt; chitr=C4=81=\r\n nul=EF=BF=BD&quot;pan=C4=81 k=C4=81nti r=C5=ABpa saubh=C4=81gya =C5=9B=C4=81lin=\r\n=C4=AB || 9 ||&lt;br&gt;&gt; a=C5=9B=E1=B9=AD=C4=81 da=C5=9Ba bhuj=C4=81 p=C5=AB.=\r\njy=C4=81 s=C4=81 sahasra bhuj=C4=81 sat=C4=AB |&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C4=81yu.dh=C4=81ny=\r\natra vak=C5=9Byant=EF=BF=BD&quot; dak=E1=B9=A3i=E1=B9=87=C4=81dha=E1=B8=A5 kara =\r\nkram=C4=81t || 10 ||&lt;br&gt;&gt; ak=E1=B9=A3m=C4=81l=C4=81 ca kamala=E1=B9=83 b=\r\na=E1=B9=87=C5=8D.si=E1=B8=A5 kuli=C5=9Ba=E1=B9=83 gad=C4=81 |&lt;br&gt;&gt; cakra=\r\n=E1=B9=83 tri=C5=9B=C5=ABla=E1=B9=83 para=C5=9B=C5=AB=E1=B8=A5 =C5=9Ba=E1=\r\n=B9=85kh=C5=8D gha=E1=B9=87=E1=B9=AD=C4=81 ca p=C4=81=C5=9Baka=E1=B8=A5 || =\r\n11 ||&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C5=9Baktirda=E1=B9=87da=C5=9Bcarma c=C4=81pa=E1=B9=83 p=C4=\r\n=81nap=C4=81tra=E1=B9=83 kama=E1=B9=87dalu=E1=B8=A5 |&lt;br&gt;&gt; ala=E1=B9=83k=\r\n=E1=B9=9Bta bhuj=C4=81m=EF=BF=BD&quot;bhir=C4=81yudhai=E1=B8=A5 kamal=C4=81san=\r\n=C4=81m || 12 ||&lt;br&gt;&gt; ***--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi n=\r\nandy rajarshi14@ wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =EF=\r\n=BF=BD=C2&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; There are no accurate pictures of Ma Chandi.
