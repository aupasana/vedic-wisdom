Thi=\r\ns statement establishes the supremacy of Japa over all other kinds of ritua=\r\nls. I have the following queries regarding Japa.\n\n1) Many a times while doi=\r\nng japa the mind wanders. The chanting done at these instants are done with=\r\nout any &quot;bhavana&quot; or sense of devotion in the mind and are merely a physica=\r\nl chanting. Are such japas unfruitful?\n\n2) Is there some way to validate th=\r\nat the japa shall actually bring certain merits or nullify the targeted evi=\r\nls? \n\n3) How can an ordinary person determine whether the japa he is doing =\r\n(or has done) is being done in a proper manner? For example if there was so=\r\nme error in pronunciation or some nyasa was not performed correctly which i=\r\nnvalidated the japa - can it be detected by the sadhaka himself by some mea=\r\nns? \n\n4) There is a tradition of doing some nyasa etc before doing mantras =\r\nwhere deities are invited on various body parts. Do those deities actually =\r\ncome and protect the entire process of Japa? Can one perceive their presenc=\r\ne in anyway - say maybe by observing a change in the aura around the sadhak=\r\na?\n\nwith regards\n\n\n\n"}}
