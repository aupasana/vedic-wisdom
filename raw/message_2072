I know it&#39;s a highly \n&gt; controversial statement and very difficult to prove or explain.\n&gt;\n&gt; Somehow i have come to some kind of abstract understanding that even \n&gt; the thing which we call &#39;free will&#39; is also pre-ordained. the famous \n&gt; example of &#39;Goat tied up with a pole&#39; by thakur, wonderful \n&gt; explanations by Narasimha and many other explanations by earlier \n&gt; philosophical thinkers in relation to free will and destiny are not to \n&gt; be disputed here. they all seem true, however, personally I&#39;ve a \n&gt; unexplainable feeling that in the ultimate analysis, all the show is \n&gt; *completely* dictated.\n&gt;\n&gt; I wish to write a bit, not for the sake of empty arguments for proving \n&gt; my point (actually i have no strong point here as my thinking is not \n&gt; baked by sound logic).\n&gt; ***Nalini bahen said that some souls have free will to take the \n&gt; rebirth and so on. i would say that here that their wish on account of \n&gt; *their own free will* is also exactly dictated by Supreme power.\n&gt;\n&gt; *Rafal questioned by stating examples of Prashna chart by Harihara and \n&gt; dharma-sastra by Bruhaspati. i would say that that also is ordained to \n&gt; happen exactly the way it happened. Prashna chart of a moment gives \n&gt; the idea of action done till that point which will dictate future \n&gt; life. my foolish, childish blabbering says that the karma till that \n&gt; moment had been pre-ordained and the future is also DONE. Hari hara \n&gt; writing prashna maarga, content of writing, use of the paper and pen, \n&gt; sitting direction, thoughts while writing, my typing on my pc, your \n&gt; reactions and everything else has actually no free will.\n&gt;\n&gt; Finally what I wish to say is that &quot;Free will is also Fixed Will&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Everything,- every damn thing, is ordered by &#39;Durgaa Bhagavati Bhadra \n&gt; yayedam dharyate jagat&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; But all these are written with some intellectual understanding and not \n&gt; realization. As narasimha Garu often says, in the realm of Maya, \n&gt; nobody can be sure of anything.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear members, including my Guru - please ignore me and also forgive me \n&gt; if it was in a bad taste, ridiculous and senseless.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yours,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, nalini swamy &lt;nalini2818@ \n&gt; ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Utpal Bhai , Rajarshi ji and all,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaskar.\n&gt; &gt; I think free will is also a part of Divine Will being orchestrated.  \n&gt; The extent of free will is to realise that Divine Will is all that \n&gt; prevails and matters and once you * realise* that is freewill, nothing \n&gt; else but unequivocal submission to Divine Will  matters.\n&gt; &gt; As The Mother said in one of her teachings that the human &#39;soul&#39; ( \n&gt; some of them I think) has the free will to choose to take birth in \n&gt; particular mother&#39;s  womb and have experiences in  certain realms. \n&gt; When the experiences manifest the human being is unaware that it their \n&gt; own free will that *opted* for those experiences and blames others for \n&gt; it, &#39;why me&#39; syndrome as I would prefer to call it. It is what you \n&gt; have asked for.... It takes a lot of realisation to unravel the \n&gt; mystery... maybe some thousands of lives when it dawns that free will \n&gt; is what the Divine  Will and submit to *it* fully and unconditionally. \n&gt; . It may seem fatalistic, ambivalent but it can help accept the fact \n&gt; that nobody else is to be blamed but your * action* with attachment as \n&gt; Narasimha ji would call it, is responsible for what you experience.\n&gt; &gt; My two cents,\n&gt; &gt; Nalini\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ____________ _________ _________ __\n&gt; &gt; From: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, 1 July, 2009 6:21:54 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Freewill.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Vijay and Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;But, does he already know how I will excersize it)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I liked your analogy of multiple versions of a movie however my \n&gt; understanding is that there is nothing called Free will in truest \n&gt; sense. everything is pre-ordined. anything and everything is shoot in \n&gt; advance. even if multiple versions are recorded, which version is \n&gt; actually going to be played is also fixed. it is all FIXED.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; bestest regards,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; utpal\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Vijaya Kumara Lakshmi \n&gt; Narayana Rao Pingali&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@ .&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajesh,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Good question!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; You may be very true when you said Freewill may not be what we \n&gt; think freewill to be.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I remembered some dialogues of Oracle in Matrix reloaded. (She \n&gt; says, you already made a choice. It is just that you need to realise \n&gt; your choice).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Our problem is that we try to assume only one of the contradicting \n&gt; things are possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Looking at analogy presented by Narasimha, future may indeed may \n&gt; have happened. How ever, who said there can only be one future?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There may be multiple versions of the same movie (one for US, one \n&gt; for India, one for Tamil, one for Telugu etc.). Our freewill may let \n&gt; us decide which movie you are going to see.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A learned person may know what will happen if you use our free \n&gt; will in a specific know.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The eventual question now is can a saintly person foresee with \n&gt; confidence of how I will excersize my freewill (he can perhaps foresee \n&gt; what will happen if I choose to excersize my freewill in a particular \n&gt; way. But, does he already know how I will excersize it)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vijay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ \n&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; No doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail for all of us, however, \n&gt; I could not help it that an inevitable question popped up in my mind. \n&gt; One of the oft discussed and eternal questions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If events have already been created like in a movie and later as \n&gt; time unfolds, they happen in our plane of existence, then all talk of \n&gt; freewill must be humbug? Like a placebo that makes us &quot;happy&quot; but in \n&gt; reality does not exist!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am not questioning that what you wrote in the mail about \n&gt; events having already happened, because same has been said by other \n&gt; great spiritual people in the world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But my question is because I cannot reconcile this with a \n&gt; freewill. Both cannot be correct. It is either this or that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Theoritically speaking, say tomorrow suddenly majority of the \n&gt; world reforms itself, does a self correction exercise and brings in \n&gt; peace, harmony etc etc, then why should the Kalki Avatar still \n&gt; incarnate? But then if the Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our \n&gt; texts say - then such a self correcting option is already negated out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, theoritically, in a very large viewpoint no one has any \n&gt; choice in the sense that finally everyone will end up merging with the \n&gt; divine.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So I guess freewill is not really as free as we love to think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 30/6/09, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Miscellany: Future, bestest homam, \n&gt; purity and overcoming ego\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 30 June, 2009, 6:01 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I mentioned an episode of a small boy who did a very short \n&gt; Chandi homam and saw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnations above the fire in the \n&gt; following mail:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 761\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This boy was born and brought up in US and is not proficient in \n&gt; his knowledge of Hinduism. He did not know much about some of the ten \n&gt; incarnations. He described what he saw and I told him who was who and \n&gt; a little about them. One of the forms he saw was a radiant man with \n&gt; white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I told him he was \n&gt; Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I \n&gt; was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This \n&gt; was abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I asked what he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not that the \n&gt; future that is to come has not already happened. It has already \n&gt; happened in reality, but it will happen later when the time comes. You \n&gt; know what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, but pretended not \n&gt; to know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy \n&gt; is not known to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main \n&gt; characteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, \n&gt; contented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But he \n&gt; could not express himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has already \n&gt; happened at some level, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind \n&gt; of like a movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a \n&gt; studio. Some people may have already seen it. But people seeing it on \n&gt; the screen later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you \n&gt; saying something like that?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If something \n&gt; is going to happen in future, it will happen when future comes. But \n&gt; somebody may be able to see it before future comes, because it has \n&gt; already happened.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking along \n&gt; these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his vision \n&gt; over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably \n&gt; confused. Given his age and ability to think and understand things, \n&gt; this probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see somebody \n&gt; who had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible \n&gt; and came to some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Time seems linear at the level of regular consciousness. \n&gt; However, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes \n&gt; changed. It even loses its meaning when one is established in non-dual \n&gt; Aatman or Brahman or Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a \n&gt; small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before \n&gt; name. When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense \n&gt; and powerful energy. It was quite different from the energy I feel \n&gt; normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blissful \n&gt; and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am done \n&gt; here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire \n&gt; consciousnss.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice before \n&gt; that. Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting \n&gt; next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second \n&gt; time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside the \n&gt; garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main \n&gt; Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint \n&gt; in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three \n&gt; occasions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes, \n&gt; that boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did so far, this \n&gt; is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to \n&gt; say it, but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This boy performed a really simple and short procedure, shorter \n&gt; than what I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful in \n&gt; making a powerful energy manifest there. The bottomline is that \n&gt; internal purity is the most important thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual better \n&gt; and get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one has \n&gt; to keep doing it until one breaks through.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Keep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do pay \n&gt; attention to internal purity as you engage in external practices. The \n&gt; only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how \n&gt; smaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist \n&gt; attraction to external things better and you can resist internal \n&gt; enemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma \n&gt; better. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the \n&gt; root cause of all problems.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but \n&gt; bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you - including \n&gt; your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body - is god&#39;s \n&gt; property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of these \n&gt; properties of god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining \n&gt; the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care of \n&gt; his master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all those things as \n&gt; his or her belongings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for \n&gt; taking good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes the \n&gt; best care of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a \n&gt; servant does not waste time worrying and crying.

I know it&#39;s a highly\ncontroversial statement and very difficult to prove or explain.&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\nSomehow i have come to some kind of abstract understanding that even\nthe thing which we call &#39;free will&#39; is also pre-ordained. the famous\nexample of &#39;Goat tied up with a pole&#39; by thakur, wonderful explanations\nby Narasimha and many other explanations by earlier philosophical\nthinkers in relation to free will and destiny are not to be disputed\nhere. they all seem true, however, personally I&#39;ve a unexplainable\nfeeling that in the ultimate analysis, all the show is *completely*\ndictated.&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\nI wish to write a bit, not for the sake of empty arguments for proving\nmy point (actually i have no strong point here as my thinking is not\nbaked by sound logic). &lt;br&gt;\n***Nalini bahen said that some souls have free will to take the rebirth\nand so on. i would say that here that their wish on account of *their\nown free will* is also exactly dictated by Supreme power.&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n*Rafal questioned by stating examples of Prashna chart by Harihara and\ndharma-sastra by Bruhaspati. i would say that that also is ordained to\nhappen exactly the way it happened. Prashna chart of a moment gives the\nidea of action done till that point which will dictate future life. my\nfoolish, childish blabbering says that the karma till that moment had\nbeen pre-ordained and the future is also DONE. Hari hara writing\nprashna maarga, content of writing, use of the paper and pen, sitting\ndirection, thoughts while writing, my typing on my pc, your reactions\nand everything else has actually no free will.&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\nFinally what I wish to say is that &quot;Free will is also Fixed Will&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\nEverything,- every damn thing, is ordered by &#39;Durgaa Bhagavati Bhadra\nyayedam dharyate jagat&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\nBut all these are written with some intellectual understanding and not\nrealization. As narasimha Garu often says, in the realm of Maya, nobody\ncan be sure of anything.&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\nDear members, including my Guru - please ignore me and also forgive me\nif it was in a bad taste, ridiculous and senseless.&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\nYours, &lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\nUtpal&lt;br&gt;\n  &lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n href=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@\nyahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;, nalini swamy &lt;nalini2818@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dear Utpal Bhai , Rajarshi ji and all,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaskar.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I think free will is also a part of Divine Will being\norchestrated.  The extent of free will is to realise that Divine Will\nis all that prevails and matters and once you * realise* that is\nfreewill, nothing else but unequivocal submission to Divine Will \nmatters. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; As The Mother said in one of her teachings that the human &#39;soul&#39; (\nsome of them I think) has the free will to choose to take birth in\nparticular mother&#39;s  womb and have experiences in  certain realms. When\nthe experiences manifest the human being is unaware that it their own\nfree will that *opted* for those experiences and blames others for it,\n&#39;why me&#39; syndrome as I would prefer to call it. It is what you have\nasked for.... It takes a lot of realisation to unravel the mystery...\nmaybe some thousands of lives when it dawns that free will is what the\nDivine  Will and submit to *it* fully and unconditionally. . It may\nseem fatalistic, ambivalent but it can help accept the fact that nobody\nelse is to be blamed but your * action* with attachment as Narasimha ji\nwould call it, is responsible for what you experience.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; My two cents,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Nalini&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ____________ _________ _________ __&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; From: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n href=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@\nyahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, 1 July, 2009 6:21:54 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Freewill.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Vijay and Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;But, does he already know how I will excersize it)?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I liked your analogy of multiple versions of a movie however my\nunderstanding is that there is nothing called Free will in truest\nsense. everything is pre-ordined. anything and everything is shoot in\nadvance. even if multiple versions are recorded, which version is\nactually going to be played is also fixed. it is all FIXED.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; bestest regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; utpal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Vijaya Kumara Lakshmi\nNarayana Rao Pingali&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@ .&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Rajesh,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Good question!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; You may be very true when you said Freewill may not be what\nwe think freewill to be.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I remembered some dialogues of Oracle in Matrix reloaded.\n(She says, you already made a choice.

One of the oft discussed and eternal questions.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If events have already been created like in a movie and\nlater as time unfolds, they happen in our plane of existence, then all\ntalk of freewill must be humbug? Like a placebo that makes us &quot;happy&quot;\nbut in reality does not exist!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I am not questioning that what you wrote in the mail\nabout events having already happened, because same has been said by\nother great spiritual people in the world. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But my question is because I cannot reconcile this with\na freewill. Both cannot be correct. It is either this or that.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Theoritically speaking, say tomorrow suddenly majority\nof the world reforms itself, does a self correction exercise and brings\nin peace, harmony etc etc, then why should the Kalki Avatar still\nincarnate? But then if the Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our texts\nsay - then such a self correcting option is already negated out.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Well, theoritically, in a very large viewpoint no one\nhas any choice in the sense that finally everyone will end up merging\nwith the divine.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So I guess freewill is not really as free as we love to\nthink.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 30/6/09, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\nwrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Miscellany: Future, bestest\nhomam, purity and overcoming ego&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, 30 June, 2009, 6:01 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I mentioned an episode of a small boy who did a very\nshort Chandi homam and saw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnations above the fire in\nthe following mail:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;http://groups.&quot;&gt;http://groups.&lt;/a&gt;\nyahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 761&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This boy was born and brought up in US and is not\nproficient in his knowledge of Hinduism. He did not know much about\nsome of the ten incarnations. He described what he saw and I told him\nwho was who and a little about them. One of the forms he saw was a\nradiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I\ntold him he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling.\nBut, when I was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious\nthought. This was abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above\nmail.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I asked what he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not that\nthe future that is to come has not already happened. It has already\nhappened in reality, but it will happen later when the time comes. You\nknow what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, but pretended not\nto know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot;\nThis boy is not known to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main\ncharacteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind,\ncontented and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But he\ncould not express himself.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has\nalready happened at some level, but will reveal itself to people later?\nKind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a\nstudio. Some people may have already seen it. But people seeing it on\nthe screen later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you\nsaying something like that?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If\nsomething is going to happen in future, it will happen when future\ncomes. But somebody may be able to see it before future comes, because\nit has already happened.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking\nalong these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his\nvision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably\nconfused. Given his age and ability to think and understand things,\nthis probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see somebody\nwho had not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible and\ncame to some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Time seems linear at the level of regular consciousness.\nHowever, in many planes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes\nchanged. It even loses its meaning when one is established in non-dual\nAatman or Brahman or Self.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam\nwith a small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added\nbefore name. When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very\nintense and powerful energy. It was quite different from the energy I\nfeel normally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and\nblissful and a feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am\ndone here. I have nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my\nentire consciousnss.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice\nbefore that. Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditating\nsitting next to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India.\nSecond time was when I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside\nthe garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the\nmain Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and worshipped by a great\nsaint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all the three\noccasions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Interestingly, after we finished meditation and opened\neyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did so far,\nthis is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how\nto say it, but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This boy performed a really simple and short procedure,\nshorter than what I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was\nsuccessful in making a powerful energy manifest there. The bottomline\nis that internal purity is the most important thing.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Rituals help purify one and purity helps one do a ritual\nbetter and get more out of it. It is an egg and chicken problem and one\nhas to keep doing it until one breaks through.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Keep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do\npay attention to internal purity as you engage in external practices.\nThe only worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how\nsmaller your ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist\nattraction to external things better and you can resist internal\nenemies like lust, anger, jealosy etc better. You can do your dharma\nbetter. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the\nroot cause of all problems.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively\nchallenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around\nyou - including your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own\nbody - is god&#39;s property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all\nof these properties of god. Do the best job you can, but without\nentertaining the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very\ngood care of his master&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all those\nthings as his or her belongings.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not\nnecessary for taking good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s\nmaster takes the best care of things entrusted to one. When a thing is\ntaken away, a servant does not waste time worrying and crying. A\nservant will accept that is master&#39;s property and can be taken away\nanytime. This enables one to do the best job with what one possesses\nand not worry about what one does not possess or what is out of one&#39;s\ncontrol.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Developing the attitude of a servant who takes care of\nmaster&#39;s properties will help one wade the ocean of worldly life\nwithout getting caught and overcome ego.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------\n--------- -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n href=&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n href=&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n href=&quot;http://groups.&quot;&gt;http://groups.&lt;/a&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n href=&quot;http://vedicastro.&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/a&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;a\n moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt;\nrologer.org&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;a\n moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot; href=&quot;http://www.SriJagan&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/a&gt;\nnath.org&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------\n--------- - &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ICC World Twenty20 England &amp;#39;09 exclusively on\nYAHOO!
