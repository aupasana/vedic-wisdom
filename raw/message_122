I chose this as per Manish ji&#39;s\nadvise and did not see a=\r\nny muhuratha. My humble thanks to Manish ji for\nencouraging me to do this.\n=\r\n\nIt was a good feeling and I know how I can improve on this.\n\nI would sugge=\r\nst for people in a similar position( living in multi\nstoreyed apartments):\n=\r\n\n1.Minimise use of camphor, its smoke set of my smoke alarm once. So keep\na=\r\n closeby window or door to exterior open.\n\n2. Use smaller piece of coconut =\r\ninitially until one is confident of\ncontrolling the agni, I used only one h=\r\nalf but felt a smaller piece\nwould have worked well too.\n\n3. Problem is in =\r\ngetting the &#39; auspicous grass &#39; . I coudnt get it hence\nused &#39; curry leaves=\r\n &#39; but they produce smoke so used only very small\nbits.\n\nAny ideas on this =\r\nManish ji/Narsimha ji?\n\n4. Keep plenty of akshatas, as I nearly ran out of =\r\nthem.\n\n5.Ghee lamp..has to be earthen, I didnt have that but will get one f=\r\nrom\nIndia, so one can use a wax lamp.\n\n6. Incense stick will keep getting b=\r\nurned out so keep lighting them.\nKeep at least 3 ready.\n\n7. Co-ordiantion o=\r\nf Homam audio and document can be challenging. Keep\nlap top on power or bat=\r\ntery may run out. Keep it at eye  distance, best\nto print off pages.\n\nThe a=\r\nudio is excellent and waits for you.\n\nI would keep the mantras ready to rea=\r\nd or memorise them, when I do this\nagain as the speed of audio for unfamili=\r\nar mantras can be daunting.\n\nFire can go off, so keep ghee drops pouring, a=\r\ndding camphor gives smoke,\nuse it only when fire has burned out. Coconut bu=\r\nrns well when the pieces\nare smaller.\n\nBest to rehearse with the document, =\r\nbefore beginning for first time. For\nfood, fruits are practical, the rice I=\r\n made in MW became very dry..prob\nneeds more practice :)\n\nThanks gain for e=\r\nxcellent audio and documentation by Manish/Narsimha\nji..this is definietly =\r\ndo able again and again.\n\nBest wishes\n\nSharat Misra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--3-9993035321-6032657567=:8\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;||Hare Ram Krishna||&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D=\r\n&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;Dear Manish and Narsimha ji,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot;=\r\n&gt;Namaskar,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D&quot;#0000ff&quot;&gt;With&nbsp; guidance from bo=\r\nth of you ,I performed the Ganapati Homam successfully today on Krishna Cha=\r\nturthi.
