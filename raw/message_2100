Mr Chopra was talking about how doctors suck people into prescription m=\r\nedicines and how that ruins some people&#39;s lives. That somehow reminded me o=\r\nf a story.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Sometime back, mother of a young man came to me to show hi=\r\ns chart. She was asking about his studies etc. But the chart was brilliant =\r\nfrom the spiritual point of view. There were many tell-tale combinations. I=\r\n declared, &quot;this is not the chart of a materialistic person, but that of a =\r\nsannyasi (ascetic/monk).&quot; She broke down into tears and gave me some backgr=\r\nound. I found out that he indeed wants to leave material life and his mothe=\r\nr does not want him to.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This boy had been calm, peaceful, contented a=\r\nnd an introvert since childhood. Oneday in his early teenage days, he had a=\r\nn interesting experience. He was in his room upstairs. His father was teach=\r\ning math to some students downstairs. He was hearing all those voices. Sudd=\r\nenly, he stopped hearing anything. He did not hear or see anything for a wh=\r\nile. His mind was completely blacked out. After a while, his mind returned =\r\nto normalcy and he saw and heard everything. But he felt a tremendous sense=\r\n of bliss and contentment then. He was overwhelmed by what he felt then.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; He realized that what people pursue as happiness is nothing in front of=\r\n what he experienced then. He did not want to study or do anything anymore.=\r\n He only wanted to experience that state. His parents became worried and to=\r\nok him to doctors. Doctors did all kinds of tests on his brain and found no=\r\nthing. He was also confined to a mental facility for one month. They put hi=\r\nm on powerful drugs and kept him under observation. He kept telling the doc=\r\ntors that there was nothing wrong with him and that they would not understa=\r\nnd what he experienced. After a month, those doctors concluded he was norma=\r\nl and had no problem. The powerful drugs he received during the month wreak=\r\ned havoc on him, but he was not angry or mad at his parents or doctors. He =\r\nsays he understands his parents love him and hence they did all this. He do=\r\nes not want to hurt them. He also says he knows what he wants but does not =\r\nknow how to get it. But he knows that regular studies and regular material =\r\nlife will not get him what he wants.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When I chatted with him alone, I=\r\n realized that he is a brilliant young man with clear thinking. He is certa=\r\ninly not a mad person. He just needs someone to show him a spiritual path t=\r\no make something permanent, which temporarily came to him and left him! To =\r\nget it permanently now, he needs to do serious sadhana. His parents also to=\r\nok him to many so-called swamijis, but he was not satisfied with the advice=\r\n given anyone. He started reading Ramana Maharshi and a few others and like=\r\nd some of them. But he is still without a clear direction.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Interestin=\r\ngly, just when I was about to chat with this person after making his parent=\r\ns leave, my guru Manish called me. He asked me what was going on. I mention=\r\ned that I was about to talk to a teenager who had a nice chart. He asked fo=\r\nr the birthdata, checked it out and confirmed my feeling that this boy had =\r\ngreat spiritual potential.\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, the system we have in pl=\r\nace looked at him with suspicion and gave powerful drugs to mess up his min=\r\nd for one full month! He is lucky and survived the ordeal. This is a sign o=\r\nf the times we live in that someone who realizes, albeit momentarily, the e=\r\nssence of scriptures, is labeled as a mentally disturbed person and powerfu=\r\nl drugs are given to him, instead of clear spiritual direction to make that=\r\n realization more permanent.\n&gt;  Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Your=\r\nself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.c=\r\nomcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -----=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; _________________________________________________________________\n&gt; Get t=\r\nhe best of MSN on your mobile\n&gt; http://clk.atdmt.com/UKM/go/147991039/direc=\r\nt/01/\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
