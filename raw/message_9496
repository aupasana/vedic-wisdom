Protect you from aagaami k=\r\narma.\nDifficulties are to cleanse our praarabdha, even great people like Ra=\r\nmana and sai baba accepted their prarabdha.\nChanting,  like gayatri,navaarn=\r\na mantra etc. when properly practised(sadhana, anushtaan)shall cleanse one =\r\nof all the karma, good or bad, as specified by our great gurus and rishis. =\r\nAlso they give the strength to over come our praarabdha. Even god is bound =\r\nto his own rules.\n\nAnd the first step to overcome a worry(a problem which i=\r\ns out of our hands), is to forget about it. Often worries lead to realisati=\r\non.\n\nWishing you the best. Chant with passion towards the deity, \nas a guid=\r\ne, mother or companion, to lead you out of this bhavasaagar also, not only =\r\nyour present difficulty.(sa-kaama and nishkaama)\nI commiserate with you, i =\r\nam jobless since nov 2008. I am helping others by whatever i can, somehow g=\r\nod is sustaining me,providence, till i get an interview call, or proper opp=\r\nortunity.\n\nRegards,\n\nVasant\n\n-----Original Message-----\nFrom: &quot;rakesh.behal=\r\n&quot;\nSent:  22-07-2013, 10:53  PM\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nSubject: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] guidance needed\n\n\nDear All,\n\nI am about to become unemployed.C=\r\nonditions at my present job became worst and indications are that they will=\r\n terminate me in 1-2 months. i am passing through rahu/moon/venus which are=\r\n at 6/8 position.\nIs there any way to save my job or get other one, i just =\r\nnow recite durga.durga and durga most of time.\n   I do not want to become u=\r\nnemployed ,pls help.\n\nthanks\nrakesh\n\n\n\n"}}
