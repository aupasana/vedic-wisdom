It exists from a differnt plane and it aims to destroy &gt;life o=\r\nn earth. It cares nothing for humans and loves eventual &gt;wanton destruction=\r\n of life.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Hitler was used as a medium by this Ashura\n\nThis is a surpr=\r\nising coincidence. I am at a remote site in Qatar. Few hours back, i had a =\r\ngood discussion with my colleague (Who is from Egypt and with me at site) a=\r\nbout the issue of religion and Allah, god etc...\nDuring our discussions, my=\r\n colleague informed me that as per Islam, Allah created Devil (Shaytan) fro=\r\nm Fire and then he created Human (Adam) from clay. Allah then ordered the d=\r\nevil to bow to the Man which was refused by Devil and since then devil is b=\r\nent upon corrupting the minds of Humans (Men & women) so that they forget A=\r\nllah and pray to false gods.\nHe told me that Devil first corrupted the mind=\r\n Adam and compelled to make him a Sin and hence Adam had to leave Heaven an=\r\nd was send to Earth. Then the devil corrupted the minds of Good people by t=\r\nactfully maneuvering them to make images and start praying them. Hence Isla=\r\nm considers that whoever is praying to Clay images or any other Gods other =\r\nthan Allah is misguided by Very intelligent Devil.\n\nThis is some what resem=\r\nble what you have mentioned in the above paragraph.\n\nHowever i had a lot of=\r\n arguments with him. I gave him many examples including the famous example =\r\nof Water Pond by Ramkrishna. I also told him that have a open mind. Now the=\r\n time has come not only to respect the other faiths but to have a firm beli=\r\nef that every faith is true and they will surely reach the supreme if they =\r\nare sincere seekers. i can not write here what all i have told him or else =\r\nit&#39;ll be very lengthy but i finally said to him that forget about all the r=\r\neligion, forget about all the dogmas, doctrines and all that which is writt=\r\nen or spoken. Until we have urge to meet the final power, until we try hard=\r\n, until we forget everything else in our life for the sake of God and until=\r\n we finally Meet God - doubts, argument and fights will never be finished. =\r\nAllah or whatever you call that power has made everything, including Devil =\r\nso it is all his/her play. he creates Human, he also creates devil then he =\r\nonly guides devil to corrupt Humans, then he only gives wisdom to some of h=\r\numans to break free from the clutches of devils and like wise play goes on =\r\nso don&#39;t worry much on these things.

Also, he need not be talking about somebody &quot;connected to&quot; his ashram. =\r\nMoreover, when it comes to great lineages, there are connections between al=\r\nl. For example, Aurobindo used to visit the house of Sister Nivedita, the f=\r\noremost disciple of Swami Vivekananda and knew her well when he still lived=\r\n in Calcutta. He had a vision in his prison cell of Swami Vivekananda, just=\r\n a few years after his death, in which he imparted Aurobindo some key knowl=\r\nedge. Paramahamsa Yogananda grew up in Calcutta and learnt Sanskrit from M,=\r\n who was a sishya of Ramakrishna and wrote the gospel of Ramakrishna. Trili=\r\nnga Swami sent a tantra teacher to Ramakrishna to expand his knowledge. Tri=\r\nlinga Swami knew Lahiri mahashaya and admired him. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Comi=\r\nng back to the main point, the supermind established in the field of earth =\r\nthat was referred to by Aurobindo can simply be a maharshi paying some atte=\r\nntion to matters on earth. A maharshi absorbed in the divine in one of the =\r\nhigher planes of consciousness can accomplish huge changes on earth by the =\r\nmere power of his thought. If there is a divine play to make some positive =\r\nchanges on earth and a maharshi takes part in the play, he may focus a smal=\r\nl part of his supermind on the affairs of earth and direct a few important =\r\nsouls to do some key work. Some important souls (deities, rishis or yogis e=\r\ntc) may send their amshas (partial essence) to be born on earth to fulfil d=\r\nifferent parts of a divine play.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You may then see several (not jus=\r\nt one) elevated beings, enlightened beings and realized beings born on eart=\r\nh to bring clarity in different aspects of spiritual knowledge. Each of the=\r\nm will get specific internal/external guidance from the divine, based on wh=\r\nat their part in the play is.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The &quot;Asura of Falseho=\r\nod&quot; that Aurobindo alluded to is all around us.

At the grossest level, he m=\r\nanifests as blatant lies, wrong propaganda etc.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One should not tol=\r\nerate this Asura (demon) and fight hard. However, one should not hate this =\r\nAsura or those afflicted by him. When we encounter lies, we should fight an=\r\nd stand for truth but not hate the liar at the same time. There is nothing =\r\nthat needs to be hated in this world. One should learn to do the job assign=\r\ned to one by Nature without attraction or repulsion to anything or anybody =\r\nand with unconditional love (i.e. no expectations of a return) to all.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsays about changes coming in the world.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know very little.

I am posting it here for anyone interested.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Near th=\r\ne beginning of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-s=\r\nage, Sri Aurobindo, began to express a truth which had not been expressed b=\r\nefore. In his high states of divine union he saw that the time had come for=\r\n a new stage in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to man=\r\nifest right here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence into =\r\nEarth life was now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth e=\r\nxperienced a breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her mate=\r\nrial body towards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n&gt; &gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; &gt; Sri Aur=\r\nobindo was joined in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa,=\r\n who later became known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey =\r\nof intensive cellular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal =\r\nuncertainties we face today.\n&gt; &gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; &gt; Sri Aurobindo saw that the d=\r\nivine force permeates all matter, and that all matter therefore has a force=\r\n of consciousness. The process of the divine spirit descending down into ma=\r\ntter is called involution. The process by which the divine ascends back upw=\r\nards out of matter is called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanit=\r\ny has reached a stage where these two events are occurring simultaneously, =\r\nand in his inner visions, he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a d=\r\nescent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=\r\n=BF=BD that would entirely change everything on Earth.\n&gt; &gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; &gt; Ma=\r\nn=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what=\r\n he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldo=\r\nm active in most people, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if o=\r\nbstructed from descent by the hard lid of his constructed personality. Ther=\r\ne is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evidence of the outer sense=\r\ns seems to contradict it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind =\r\nis going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been reached in which =\r\nthe human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand, but is left hop=\r\nelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, a=\r\ns the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a consciousness higher tha=\r\nn the human rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind, has recently b=\r\neen established in the fields of the Earth, and is active there. Our task n=\r\now is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Evolution took=\r\n a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and later with the emergenc=\r\ne of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap forward, even more m=\r\nomentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo s=\r\npeaks about four stages of human evolution, which we will soon be starting =\r\nto experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=\r\n=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessing an individualize=\r\nd soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging with it.\n&gt; &gt; =EF=\r\n=BF=BD\n&gt; &gt; Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spo=\r\nntaneous- ly coming to birth under the influence of an ever-expanding supra=\r\nmental field, a being that is largely able to merge and live from soul-cons=\r\nciousness rather than mind-consciousness. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thirdly is the =EF=BF=\r\n=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will=\r\n be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness =\r\nthat has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally, our=\r\n ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD div=\r\ninity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matter. This will be a r=\r\nace of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this spec=\r\nies, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supram=\r\nental consciousness down into the cellular consciousness of their own bodie=\r\ns. Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant that the supramental c=\r\nonsciousness was simultaneously being brought into the consciousness fields=\r\n of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower into its full manif=\r\nestation in collective matter.\n&gt; &gt; Whenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=\r\n=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother spea=\r\nk of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially a=\r\nnti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkne=\r\nss, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death.=\r\n These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be =\r\nin control of current global events. According to them the Asura of Darknes=\r\ns (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently, and the Asura of S=\r\nuffering has returned to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to=\r\n wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =\r\n=EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of the=\r\nir own intensive inner work in countering his influence. It would not be di=\r\nfficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders i=\r\nn the current political sphere.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With the descent of this new vibra=\r\ntory consciousness all our old obsolete human structures will be demolished=\r\n. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes will be enorm=\r\nous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automati=\r\ncally erases Falsehood, and our world for the most part consists of Falseho=\r\nod. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a power of harmonization w=\r\nhich could overcome this resistance by means other than dramatic struggle a=\r\nnd violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their original ema=\r\nnations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to specula=\r\nte, with all the violence in the world today, the destruction we might have=\r\n experienced if not for this power of harmonization!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When does all=\r\n this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother believed that the world stage wa=\r\ns set for this quantum descent, and that it was quite imminent. The Mother =\r\nsaid in 1968 that the supramental transformation was a certainty now, and t=\r\nhat it would come about with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough th=\r\nis minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 woul=\r\nd be a turning point.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This was a very interesting read and matches=\r\n what Narasimhaji says about changes coming in the world.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Regards=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva S=\r\nutra\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Love Cr=\r\nicket?
