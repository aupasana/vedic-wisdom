Does it explain the difference correctly?\n\nWhy do in som=\r\ne months the Hindu birthday falls before the birthday according to Georgian=\r\n calendar, and some year after?\n\nThanks again\nRanga\n\nThe Gregorian calendar=\r\n is based upon the solar system and hence it has 365 days. The Hindu calend=\r\nar is based upon the lunar and solar systems. With the new moon appearing a=\r\nfter every 27.1/2 days, the 12 lunar months take 354 days. The difference o=\r\nf 11 days is adjusted every three years when an additional month called adh=\r\nik-mas is added. The difference between the two calendars explains why the =\r\ndates of Hindu festivals vary every year.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom, &quot;Ranga Nambakam&quot; &lt;ranga_nambakam2000@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear learned memb=\r\ners\n&gt; \n&gt; Please permit me to ask this slightly off-topic question.\n&gt; \n&gt; I a=\r\nm unable to explain to my European friends why one&#39;s date of birth differs =\r\nbetween the Georgian calendar and Hindu calendar.
