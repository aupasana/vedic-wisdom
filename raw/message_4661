Below are two instances where Sri Bhagavan talks about\nMadhav=\r\naswami with great compassion.\n\nLetters from Sri Ramanasramam,by Suri Nagamm=\r\na\n\n12th July 1946, (51) DEATH OF MADHAVASWAMY\n\nMadhavaswami was a Malayalee=\r\n. His birthplace is a village near Palghat. He\nwas a brahmachari. He came h=\r\nere about 15 years back, when he was only 20\nyears of age and did personal =\r\nservice to Bhagavan. For some time past, he\nhad had a desire to visit holy =\r\nplaces, and so used to go away frequently and\ncome back. When Acharyaswami,=\r\nwho was another devotee of Bhagavan, in charge\nof the Math which was built =\r\nfor him in Kumbakonam,came here some time back\nand passed away,Madhava went=\r\n there as head of the Math and passed away\nwithin a short time there after.=\r\n\n\nAbout four days ago, i.e. in the morning of the 8th or 9th, I went to\nBha=\r\ngavan=E2=80=99s presence at 7-30. As I got up after prostrating before him,=\r\n\nBhagavan said, =E2=80=9CMadhava is gone.=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CWhere to?=E2=80=\r\n=9D I asked, as he was in the\nhabit of going away from the Asramam on pilgr=\r\nimage now and then. Smilingly\nBhagavan said, =E2=80=9CWhere to? To that pla=\r\nce, leaving the body here.=E2=80=9D I was\nshocked and asked, =E2=80=9CWhen?=\r\n=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9CThe day before\nyesterday at 6 p.m.,=E2=80=9D replied Bha=\r\ngavan, and looking at Krishnaswami, said,\n=E2=80=9CAcharyaswami who was the=\r\nre came here and died, and the one who was here\nwent there and died. Everyt=\r\nhing moves according to fate. For a long time\nMadhava had a desire that he =\r\nshould be independent and without anyone in\nauthority over him. His desire =\r\nhas at last been fulfilled. Anyway he was a\ngood man. Merely for fun when A=\r\ncharyaswami who was in Kumbakonam passed\naway, I asked Madhava whether he w=\r\nould go, as there was no one there in the\nMath. He took up the idea, went t=\r\nhere and thus\nfulfilled his desire. See how things happen! When I wrote Tel=\r\nugu Dvipada and\nother verses in Malayalam script in a notebook, he used to =\r\nread them well\njust like Telugu people. He had some Telugu =E2=80=98Samskar=\r\na=E2=80=99 (knowledge). He took\naway that notebook saying that he would be =\r\nlooking into it now and then. If\nit is there, tell them to bring it here. I=\r\nt was the same with Ayyaswami. He\ntook away a notebook, saying that he woul=\r\nd bring it back after reading it.\nHe himself never came back. The same thin=\r\ng has happened with this man also.=E2=80=9D\nSo saying he changed the topic.=\r\n When they heard that a person who had\nfollowed Bhagavan almost like his sh=\r\nadow for 12 years, and was extremely\nmeek and gentle by nature, had passed =\r\naway suddenly somewhere, there was no\none in the Asramam who did not shed a=\r\n tear.\n\nKunjuswami who had gone from here to supervise Madhava=E2=80=99s bu=\r\nrial ceremonies,\ncame back this morning at 8 a.m. and after prostrating bef=\r\nore Bhagavan said,\n=E2=80=9CMadhavaswamy was wandering about in search of p=\r\neace of mind but could not\ngain peace, and so he told people that he would =\r\nnot live any longer, and\ncame to the Math at Kumbakonam. He had a sudden at=\r\ntack of diarrhea for a\nday, and as he complained of difficulty breathing wh=\r\nile taking soda water,\nhe was made to lie down. He never regained conscious=\r\nness,according to what\nthe people in the Math told me.They kept the corpse =\r\ntill I got there. It did\nnot deteriorate in any way even though three days =\r\nhad elapsed. I got it\nburied and have come back. I could not find the note-=\r\nbook anywhere.=E2=80=9D\n\nSri Ramana Reminiscences, by G.V. Subbaramayya\n\nOn=\r\ne noon Sri Subbalakshamamma observed that the white peacock who was being\ns=\r\no much fondled by Sri Bhagavan might be Madhavaswami, the late attendant of=\r\n\nSri Bhagavan. A little later as I entered the Hall, Sri Bhagavan said that=\r\n\nsome people believe that the white peacock was the reincarnation of\nMadhav=\r\naswami; and ever afterwards Sri Bhagavan used to address him as\n=E2=80=98Ma=\r\ndhava=E2=80=99.\n\nOn June 20, 1947, I composed eight Telugu verses on the wh=\r\nite peacock in\nMayura Vrittam (peacock-metre) and presented them to Sri Bha=\r\ngavan in the\nJubilee pandal. He appeared greatly pleased with them and hand=\r\ning them to\nSrimati Lalita Venkataraman, he suggested that she might sing t=\r\nhem with her\nveena . Within half and hour she brought her veena and got rea=\r\ndy to sing.\nJust then the white peacock was absent. Sri Bhagavan said, =E2=\r\n=80=9CBut the hero\nmust be present to hear his praises sung! Where are you,=\r\n Madhava? Come.=E2=80=9D Lo!\nAt once the white peacock jumped down from the=\r\n roof of the pandal; and while\nLalita Venkatraman sang, he spread out his t=\r\nail feather and danced as Sri\nBhagavan sat and watched him with beaming eye=\r\ns. When the singing concluded,\nthe peacock walked to the veena and pecked a=\r\nt its strings with his\nbeak.Thereupon Sri Bhagavan told the singer, =E2=80=\r\n=9CMadhava wants you to repeat\nthe song.=E2=80=9D So she sang once more and=\r\n the peacock danced again. It was a\nsight for the gods to see.\n\n-- Letters =\r\nfrom Sri Ramanasramam,by Suri Nagamma\n\nSource:\nhttp://sriramanamaharshi.org=\r\n/pdf/Saranagathi_eNewsletter_January_2010.pdf\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd5c292749d40048b67fd62\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nMadhavaswami rendered dedicated service to Sri Bhagavan for appr=\r\noximately twelve years.
