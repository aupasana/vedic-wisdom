Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; The nature of mind is to wander and think various things. Mind will \ns=\r\ntop thinking only when it is in samadhi. Until then, it will \ncontinue to g=\r\net some good thoughts and some bad thoughts. That is its \nnature.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The=\r\n goal of sadhana is to train the mind to focus on one thing. \nSome may trai=\r\nn the mind to focus on a mantra. Some may train the mind \nto focus on music=\r\nal notes. Some may train the mind to focus on the \nbreathing. In various ty=\r\npes of spiritual sadhana, you have one object \nfor the mind to focus on. St=\r\nill, mind tries to wander off all the \ntime.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If a computer is running=\r\n a program and a virus or spyware or adware \nstarts running, an anti-virus =\r\nprogram&#39;s watchdog task that is running \nin the same computer detects it an=\r\nd deletes it (before it does much \nharm). Similarly, install a watchdog tas=\r\nk in your mind. Suppose you \nare meditating or doing some sadhana and tryin=\r\ng to focus the mind on \nsomething. Suppose some other (good or bad!) though=\r\nts come to the \nmind. As soon as you are aware of it (i.e. the watchdog tas=\r\nk detects \nthem), simply delete the thoughts.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I recommend not getting=\r\n aggravated or frustrated at the bad \nthoughts. Just become aware of them a=\r\nnd tell yourself to focus on the \nmantra. It is *natural* for the mind to b=\r\ne thinking of those bad \nthoughts. By being aggravated or frustrated, you a=\r\nre only increasing \nthe distraction. It is like picking fight with a heckle=\r\nr who \ninterrupts a speech you are giving or a song you are singing. Become=\r\n \naware and move on. If you pick a fight with the heckler it does more \nhar=\r\nm than the original heckling!\n&gt;  \n&gt; By being aware of the distraction, ackn=\r\nowledging it and then \nconsciously trying to ignore it, you are maximizing =\r\nyour chances of \nsuccessfully returning the full attention of the mind to t=\r\nhe mantra. \nOf course, the distraction will keep coming again and again. Bu=\r\nt the \nbest option is to tell your mind to focus on the mantra each time yo=\r\nu \nare aware of the distraction. Do NOT get frustrated. As you keep \ndoing =\r\nthis over and over and over, the heckler may decide to shut up. \nSimilarly,=\r\n as you ignore distractions of the mind, eventually oneday \na pleasant acci=\r\ndent will happen and mind will achieve absolute focus \non the mantra, with =\r\nno other thoughts! THAT is when you experience \nthe mantra and deity. Until=\r\n then, it is a rehearsal.\n&gt;  \n&gt; All thoughts - good or bad - are distractio=\r\nns. When you are \nmeditating with a mantra, the mind should be focused on O=\r\nNE thing. \nThat one thing can be the sound of the mantra or an image of the=\r\n \ndeity you have in your mind or a thought that &quot;so and so deity is \nsuprem=\r\ne. I am an insignificant servant&quot; etc. Try to focus your mind \non that one =\r\nfocus point. As other thoughts come, become aware and \nmove on without any =\r\nfrustration or sadness or anger or disappointment.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Original mail said=\r\n: &quot;In my heart I definetly do not want them to \nmaterialize.&quot;. Please reali=\r\nze that one&#39;s thinking or not thinking of \nsomething has nothing to do with=\r\n something happening or not \nhappening. Thinking that you make several thin=\r\ngs happen, that there \nis a cause-effect relationship between various thing=\r\ns in the universe \nand you have a role in it is an unnecessary burden. Tell=\r\n yourself \nthat She (or He) does it all and you are just an insignificant \n=\r\nservant who happens to be there observing it all. It is a simpler \nworld vi=\r\new and one that does not burden you. Moreover, it is a more \naccurate view.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Fr=\r\nee Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre =\r\n(SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------ \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n=\r\n&gt;   From: Ashwin Rawal \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Thu=\r\nrsday, February 12, 2009 12:08 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Contendin=\r\ng with highly negative \nthoughts during Japa\n&gt; \n&gt;         Dear Sir,\n&gt;      =\r\n   I also agree with this mail.
