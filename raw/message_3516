In my experience  chanting the Ga=\r\nyatri mantra and firmly establishing it in the Hridaya can lead to knowledg=\r\ne of the Atman.(Soul)\n\nOnly one who is a knower of the Gayatri is a Brahman=\r\n,the rest are simply dependant one their credentials at birth and intellige=\r\nnce .Whilst they like themselves to be called as brahmanas they are actuall=\r\ny in a worse position than anybody else in society.Why should I say this wi=\r\nth authority?Because I know this truth having experienced it.\n\n\n\nYes ,as lo=\r\nng as they are willing to follow the caveats of Yama,niyama,which include n=\r\nonviolence (ie no meat),purity of the body and mind (Shaucha) and pronounce=\r\n the mantra properly with the swaras.For manasika japa there is no restrict=\r\nion on the swaras but better results are got if the mantra swaras embedd th=\r\nemselves in the mind.\n\n\n\nThe Gayatri should be recited at either the Khanda=\r\n Sandhya(Early morning -an hour before and an hour after sunrise) or /and t=\r\nhe Shuddha Sandhya(an hour before and an hour after sunset) or the Turiya S=\r\nandhya(an hour before and after midnight). The minimum number is 10 or 28 t=\r\nimes but to have anubhava try this .Starting at an auspicious time ,use a r=\r\nudraksha mala(5 mukhi will do,it must be small beads ideally),a woollen whi=\r\nte or red blanket to sit upon(Darbhasan is ideal),and facing east in the mo=\r\nrning start japa of Gayatri.Finish a mala at least and chant in a way that =\r\nonly you can hear yourself.Increase this to 2 or 3 malas at both sandhyas.\n=\r\n\nThe word &quot;Gayatri&quot; itself explains the meaning of this mantra. It has its =\r\norigin in the Sanskrit phrase Gayantam Triyate iti, and refers to that mant=\r\nra which rescues the chanter from all adverse situations that may lead to s=\r\npiritual death. \n\nGoddess Gayatri is also called &quot;Veda-Mata&quot; or the Mother =\r\nof the Vedas =97 Rig, Yajur, Saam and Atharva =97 because it is the very ba=\r\nsis of the Vedas. It is the basis, the reality behind the experienced and t=\r\nhe cognized universe. \n\nThe Gayatri mantra is composed of a metre consistin=\r\ng of 24 syllables =97 generally arranged in a triplet of eight syllables ea=\r\nch. Therefore, this particular meter (tripadhi) is also known as the Gayatr=\r\ni Meter or &quot;Gayatri Chhanda.&quot; \n\nThe Mantra\n\nAum\nBhuh Bhuvah Svah(give a fra=\r\nction of a second halt here)\nTat Savitur Varenyam(another fraction of a sec=\r\nond halt here)\nBhargo Devasya Dheemahi(another fraction of a second halt he=\r\nre)\nDhiyo Yo nah Prachodayat\n\n~ The Rig Veda (10:16:3)\n\n\n\nTat, says Woodrof=\r\nfe, refers to the first cause of all substance, as fire in the circle of th=\r\ne sun and is supreme Brahman. Savituh is the source of all living beings. V=\r\narenyam is the excellent one who receives adoration. Bharga destroys sin, D=\r\nevasya means it is full of light, while Dhimahi refers to knowledge being g=\r\nolden and always within the sun. Dhiyo means Buddhi, Yo stands for energy (=\r\ntejas). The mantra is divided into three sections of eight letters and four=\r\n sections of six letters. A dhyana (meditation) in the same chapter describ=\r\nes Gayatri as having four faces, which are white, yellow, red and black. \n\n=\r\nYet the tantrik tradition has different views of the Gayatri. For example, =\r\nin the Matrikabhedatantra, there is a couplet which says a person who knows=\r\n the Brahman (the absolute), is a brahmin. \n\nIn the tantrik tradition, each=\r\n aspect of devata has her or his own form of the Gayatri and it is often pr=\r\nonounced at the four junctions of the day, including midnight. \n\n\nThe tantr=\r\na based Gayatri is  known as  the Ajapa japa.\n\nSooo is the sound created wh=\r\nilst inhalation and Hummm whilst exhalation.This method of chanting the man=\r\ntra whilst the root of the uvula is pressed upon by the tip of the tongue o=\r\nr whilst concentration is made upon either the breath,the Hridaya,the Ajna =\r\nchakra or the Sahasrara brings about dissolution of the sensation of the St=\r\nhula Sharira(physical body) and a tremendous perception that one is the Atm=\r\nan.It destroys the attachments and rids one of the Shad Ripus(the six enemi=\r\nes of man).It gives a clear idea of what ones previous births are ,etc.But =\r\none should be forewarned.The practise of mere physical mudras without the l=\r\nearning of Atman tattwa will only give Siddhis and bind one to the material=\r\n world by increasing karmas.\n\nThis  Ajapa is recited by every living being =\r\nunconsciously 21,600 times a day as she or he breathes. Half are the  breat=\r\nhs  which go through the channel of the Sun and half are breaths which go t=\r\nhrough the channel of the Moon.ie.The Pingala and Ida nadis. It consists of=\r\n the letters Ha and Sa.\n\nFools like to say that these nadis exist within th=\r\ne physical structures in the body but they are simply gassing about.The tru=\r\nth is that these channels and the Kundalini Shakti exist in the Sookshma sh=\r\narira .These have an association with the Stula sharira and can when concen=\r\ntrated upon result in the flow of Prana through the nadis .\n\nRecitation of =\r\nthe Gayatri brings about spiritual change from within.It invokes the Suprem=\r\ne energy Gayatri mata which the Christians call as the Holy spirit and brin=\r\ngs the glory of the Atman forth.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
