It&#39;s not safe out here. It&#39;s wondrous with treasures to satiat=\r\ne desires both subtle and gross. But it&#39;s not for the timid.&quot; - Q, Star Tre=\r\nk TNG\n\nWho am I?\n\nAm I a body which is believed to have a soul?\n\nI came int=\r\no existence the moment this body was conceived. It verifies my being, valid=\r\nates my life. It has a brain that makes sense of the gibberish that is thro=\r\nwn at it, finds a purpose and leads me the way I am supposed to be led. My =\r\nbody also has a heart. It feels, it loves and makes me desire everything mo=\r\nre and more. An organ called soul is yet to be found.\n\nThen, there is the p=\r\noint when my body exists but my brain and heart stop functioning. I sometim=\r\nes wonder if I am a body, how can I experience things that are way beyond i=\r\nts extremities. If I am a body, I shouldn&#39;t be dead before my body is incin=\r\nerated on the funeral pyre.\n\nPerhaps, I am a soul which sometimes chooses t=\r\no have a body.\n\nI am here to learn, experience and discover. What I know pr=\r\nevails even when my body does not. I&#39;ll also teach, share and inspire; some=\r\ntimes without my body&#39;s intervention. I know, this body is an illusion alth=\r\nough sometimes I prefer not to remember this fact so that I can allow mysel=\r\nf to indulge without worrying about the consequences and witness whatever t=\r\nranspires.\n\nOnce I have experienced all there is to experience, learned wha=\r\ntever I need to learn, the illusion will help me break free from the life -=\r\n death cycle and I&#39;ll return to my rightful place. But, if I am not careful=\r\n, it will turn the cycle into a perpetual trap. I can be addicted to variou=\r\ns bonds. The blinding emotions will never let me remember the fact which I =\r\nhad chosen to forget temporarily. Misguided by attachments, I&#39;ll be lost in=\r\n a flurry of conflicting anomalies. If, as fate would have it, that happens=\r\n, I&#39;ll be drawn here at the temple of the dark, ultimate truth.\n\nThis eeril=\r\ny calm place is called the Shmashan, the cremation ground - a gateway to bo=\r\nth the heaven of moksh and the hell of rebirth. This place is where empty s=\r\nhells turn to ash, the worthless is disposed of and myths are dispelled. It=\r\n is so attuned to banishing the illusionary light that its mere mention mad=\r\ndens the ignorant and drives them away.\n\nDetachment must come naturally - u=\r\nnabashed and free from all comforting lures. There can&#39;t be even a trace of=\r\n any worldly affair.=C2=A0 I must learn to separate the essence from the se=\r\nmblance. Once I have mastered the ensemble and the parts, I&#39;ll be free. My =\r\nexistence will be devoid of sadness. I&#39;ll savor the pleasure in every possi=\r\nble way. Then, I&#39;ll get caught again. Only then, I&#39;ll be able to understand=\r\n that like my captivity, my freedom is also an illusion.\n\nThe more I look a=\r\nt the funeral pyre, the more it intrigues me. First, the blistering heat bo=\r\nils the flesh away from the bones; then, it chars them differently into a s=\r\ningle substance, ash. So many bodies, so different from each other and yet,=\r\n they all end up the same, indistinguishable from each other.\n\nDancing on a=\r\n whim, flowing transcendentally, spreading warmth without bias, the fire th=\r\nat burns the funeral pyre needs sustenance, produces smoke and leaves resid=\r\nue. It may brighten my surroundings, but it can&#39;t enlighten me.\n\nThe fire t=\r\nhat can enlighten me does not brighten anything at all. It is darker than t=\r\nhe darkest corner of my psyche. It is omnipresent, relies on nothing and an=\r\nnihilates everything. The ignorant project it as a symbol of negativity the=\r\n world over. The wise embrace it as the blessing of goddess Kali.\n\nGoddess =\r\nKali is the presiding deity of the Shmashan. She is the beginning, she is t=\r\nhe end. A primal force that enchants everything, she destroys worldly bonda=\r\nges while blessing with divine pleasures. She is the stark representation o=\r\nf the ultimate truth, she is the illusion. She is the one who dominates thi=\r\ns universe. Damned or blessed, she listens to all.\n\nI don&#39;t need to call he=\r\nr. I don&#39;t need complex procedures, long rituals or tongue twisting mantras=\r\n to blend with her. All I need is Kalika Ashtak.\n\nKalika Ashtak is an eight=\r\n versed hymn created by Adi Shankaracharya. It encompasses the energy that =\r\nexisted before the inception of time. It vibrates with the darkness that wi=\r\nll prevail after everything else has perished. Everyone who should know it,=\r\n knows it; many experience divine joy reciting it; and some transcend the v=\r\nisible universe meditating on it. It can negate every negativity.\n\nI have m=\r\ny share of negativity. It is way too potent for conventional means. It has =\r\na much larger sphere of influence. It affects everything associated with me=\r\n; but, to my utter dismay, it hurts me the most.\n\nKalika Ashtak protects me=\r\n from my own negativity. It engulfs my negativity with the darkness emanati=\r\nng from goddess Kali, transforms it into energy and channels it towards my =\r\nKundalini enabling me to achieve any goal.\n\nTonight, it will enliven the Sh=\r\nmashan for me.\n\nhttp://chronicles-of-a-sadhak.blogspot.com/\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n---288413194-1623517966-1442294181=:38051\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;t=\r\nop&quot;&gt;Nice article.

I know, this body is an illusion a=\r\nlthough sometimes I prefer not to remember this fact so that I can allow my=\r\nself to indulge without worrying about the consequences and witness whateve=\r\nr transpires.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Once I have experienced =\r\nall there is to experience, learned whatever I need to learn, the illusion =\r\nwill help me break free from the life - death cycle and I&#39;ll return to my r=\r\nightful place. But, if I am not careful, it will turn the cycle into a perp=\r\netual trap. I can be addicted to various bonds. The blinding emotions will\n=\r\n never let me remember the fact which I had chosen to forget temporarily. M=\r\nisguided by attachments, I&#39;ll be lost in a flurry of conflicting anomalies.=\r\n If, as fate would have it, that happens, I&#39;ll be drawn here at the temple =\r\nof the dark, ultimate truth.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;This eeri=\r\nly calm place is called the Shmashan, the cremation ground - a gateway to b=\r\noth the heaven of moksh and the hell of rebirth. This place is where empty =\r\nshells turn to ash, the worthless is disposed of and myths are dispelled. I=\r\nt is so attuned to banishing the illusionary light that its mere mention ma=\r\nddens the ignorant and drives them away.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;non=\r\ne&quot;&gt;Detachment must come naturally - unabashed and free from all comforting =\r\nlures. There can&#39;t be even a trace of any worldly affair.&nbsp; I must lear=\r\nn to separate the essence from the semblance. Once I have mastered the ense=\r\nmble and the parts, I&#39;ll be free. My existence will be devoid of sadness.\n =\r\nI&#39;ll savor the pleasure in every possible way. Then, I&#39;ll get caught again.=\r\n Only then, I&#39;ll be able to understand that like my captivity, my freedom i=\r\ns also an illusion.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;The more I look at=\r\n the funeral pyre, the more it intrigues me. First, the blistering heat boi=\r\nls the flesh away from the bones; then, it chars them differently into a si=\r\nngle substance, ash. So many bodies, so different from each other and yet, =\r\nthey all end up the same, indistinguishable from each other.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;no=\r\nne&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Dancing on a whim, flowing transcendentally, spreadi=\r\nng warmth without bias, the fire that burns the funeral pyre needs sustenan=\r\nce, produces smoke and leaves residue. It may brighten my surroundings, but=\r\n it can&#39;t enlighten me.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;The fire that =\r\ncan enlighten me does not brighten anything at all. It is darker than the d=\r\narkest corner of my psyche. It is omnipresent, relies on nothing and\n annih=\r\nilates everything. The ignorant project it as a symbol of negativity the wo=\r\nrld over. The wise embrace it as the blessing of goddess Kali.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;=\r\nnone&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Goddess Kali is the presiding deity of the Shmasha=\r\nn. She is the beginning, she is the end. A primal force that enchants every=\r\nthing, she destroys worldly bondages while blessing with divine pleasures. =\r\nShe is the stark representation of the ultimate truth, she is the illusion.=\r\n She is the one who dominates this universe. Damned or blessed, she listens=\r\n to all.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;I don&#39;t need to call her. I d=\r\non&#39;t need complex procedures, long rituals or tongue twisting mantras to bl=\r\nend with her. All I need is Kalika Ashtak.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;n=\r\none&quot;&gt;Kalika Ashtak is an eight versed hymn created by Adi Shankaracharya. I=\r\nt encompasses the energy that existed before the inception of time. It vibr=\r\nates with the darkness that will prevail after everything else has\n perishe=\r\nd. Everyone who should know it, knows it; many experience divine joy reciti=\r\nng it; and some transcend the visible universe meditating on it. It can neg=\r\nate every negativity.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;I have my share =\r\nof negativity. It is way too potent for conventional means. It has a much l=\r\narger sphere of influence. It affects everything associated with me; but, t=\r\no my utter dismay, it hurts me the most.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;non=\r\ne&quot;&gt;Kalika Ashtak protects me from my own negativity. It engulfs my negativi=\r\nty with the darkness emanating from goddess Kali, transforms it into energy=\r\n and channels it towards my Kundalini enabling me to achieve any goal.&lt;br c=\r\nlear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Tonight, it will enliven the Shmashan for =\r\nme.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; shape=3D&quot;rect&quot;=\r\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://chronicles-of-a-sadhak.blogspot.com/&quot;&gt;htt=\r\np://chronicles-of-a-sadhak.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;br\n clear=3D&quot;none&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv9378720859yui-cursor&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n =\r\n   &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;height:0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  =\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;hei=\r\nght:0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;/tbody&gt;   &lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n---288413194-1623517966-1442294181=:38051--\r\n\n"}}
