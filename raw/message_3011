I occasionally visit =\r\nthis forum. I happened to see several emails about AOL and the below email =\r\nfrom Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual practices and as a=\r\n disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want to clarify a few thing=\r\ns to the extent of my understanding.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are several paths each lead=\r\ning to the destination of Sat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use a=\r\nusterities, some use devotion, etc. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss =\r\nis also blissful. That does not make it in any way inferior to paths of aus=\r\nterities. As Sri Aurobindo would call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this pa=\r\nth one does not suddenly emerge into SatChitAnanda. The personality of the =\r\nsadhak is transformed slowly and the sadhak radiates more and more as they =\r\nprogress more and more.\n&gt; \n&gt; In my experience, AOL is a seamless blend of R=\r\naja yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in AOL =\r\nis not just doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)understoo=\r\nd. Pranayams and Sudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing and settling of the=\r\n mind and preparing for meditation and doing other spiritual practices of c=\r\nontemplation, Seva for rest of the day wit the right attitude. Regular prac=\r\ntice of Sudarshan Kriya removes / breaks old patterns and\n&gt; \n&gt; AOL includes=\r\n some yoga asanas to prepare the body (the Padma Sadhana sequence of asanas=\r\n taught in DSN course and Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar) taught in Part I=\r\nI or advance courses fall under this category.\n&gt; \n&gt; The raja yoga practices=\r\n include all the pranayams, Sudarshan Kriya, mudras, bandhas, meditations t=\r\naught in Art of Living course, advance courses, Sahaj samadhi meditation co=\r\nurse, etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Knowledge part includes deep contemplative study and im=\r\nbibing of Narada Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and =\r\nBhagavat Gita. Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very elaborate commentary on a=\r\nll of the above. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and=\r\n the publicly available commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD e=\r\npisodes! Besides daily study of Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; recommended. Le=\r\narning and contemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for those that strive =\r\nto become Art of Living teachers.\n&gt; \n&gt; The path of AOL emphasises on Surren=\r\nder and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama sankeertan and bhajans are =\r\na standard feature of AOL satsangs.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some wonder why AOL charges for th=\r\nese courses and some wonder about lack of a Sadhguru at every stage.\n&gt; \n&gt; L=\r\net me clarify from my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fu=\r\nlly Enlightened Master living in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of =\r\nguiding millions of devotees in every step of the sadhana without having to=\r\n be near them in person. Several get necessary guidance in dreams (I myself=\r\n had that experience twice), some in person and several via various other w=\r\nays. However, to get these guidance, an inner connection with the Master is=\r\n essential. Until that stage, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate =\r\nand in-depth commentaries on various Knowledge are more than enough to guid=\r\ne disciples to a stage where conscious inner communion with Guru can be est=\r\nablished.\n&gt; \n&gt; Several of the senior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis=\r\n) are yogis of a very high order capable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciou=\r\nsness at will during meditation. They may be not fully established in it li=\r\nke Sri Sri, but act as channels of the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a =\r\nSadhak as and when needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is very easy to accept those that left t=\r\nheir body as having achieved highest realization such as Sri Aurobindo or S=\r\nri Ramakrishna or Ramana Maharishi. However it is a human tendency to doubt=\r\n them when they are in physical form.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding AOL charging money for=\r\n its courses: AOL is world&#39;s largest volunteer run organization. Neither AO=\r\nL teachers nor its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All t=\r\nhe proceeds go to the charitable activities again run by volunteers. Many o=\r\nf the full time teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and millions =\r\nworth in property to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishanka=\r\nr neither needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri ha=\r\nve went through very bad and sometimes even dangerous conditions to bring t=\r\nhe Knowledge to the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs=\r\n to be revealed to maximum number of people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Senior AOL teachers have =\r\nfaced danger to their lives by going without any help or guidance to areas =\r\ninfested with naxalites, terrorists in North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Palestine=\r\n, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. with nothing but love and Divine Grace as their =\r\naid.\n&gt; \n&gt; As far as I know, money is charged in AOL courses for two reasons=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Past experience showed that those that paid for the courses seem =\r\nto follow the practices more diligently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no d=\r\neserving person should be denied a course because they cannot afford to pay=\r\n. As a volunteer, I was part of organizing several AOL courses and know fir=\r\nst hand many cases where people took courses for free and were also provide=\r\nd free accommodation, etc. Whenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers =\r\ngo there paying from their own pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free =\r\nand provide healing to the victims. AOL does not advertise it or make a sho=\r\nw of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) This is my understanding and not AOl position. It removes =\r\nthe Karmic debt to the AOL teachers and volunteers who still may have some =\r\ndoership in them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, Sri Sri is only interested in getting every=\r\none turn inwards and express the love, joy and compassion that is inside ev=\r\neryone. As long as one follows a path, any path and surrenders to any Sat G=\r\nuru, we are happy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; Siva.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yaho=\r\nogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhere was some discussion on breathing exercises such as Sudarshan kriya tau=\r\nght at AOL courses. I do not want to comment on specific courses or techniq=\r\nues, but will make a comment on Raja yoga practices in general.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bre=\r\nathing is a very important activity and is connected to the balance between=\r\n sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous systems. It maintains the life for=\r\nce and emotional balance. Several breathing exercises are taught by various=\r\n scriptures and traditions, such as praanaayaama taught by Baba Ramdev of P=\r\natanjali Yoga Foundation, Kriya yoga taught by Mahavatar Babaji and Paramah=\r\namsa Yogananda, Sudarsana kriya taught by Art Of Living foundation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n All these fall under Raja yoga, in the four-fold division of Jnaana, Bhakt=\r\ni, Karma and Raja yogas. If these exercises are used as a means to regulate=\r\n breathing and thoughts upto some level and keep the body fit, it is fine. =\r\nThey are quite useful.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was watching a nice TV progr=\r\nam of a Baba who popularized praanaayaamas like kapaalabhaati and anuloma-v=\r\niloma among Indian masses. He talked about breathing in and out slowly and =\r\ngradually reaching nirbeeja samadhi through it. I was amused. Most people h=\r\nave too many (and quite firm) impurities in their subtle bodies in the form=\r\n of prior mental conditioning to be cleared just through breathing exercise=\r\ns and to reach samadhi - nirbeeja or sabeeja - just by doing praanaayaama. =\r\nHowever, I like the praanaayaamas he teaches. In fact, things like anuloma-=\r\nviloma praanaayaama and kapaalabhaati are badly needed in today&#39;s stressed =\r\nout world. However, I see this as something that relieves physical and emot=\r\nional stress and enables better spiritual sadhana, rather than something th=\r\nat enables spiritual realization.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Of course, there are yogic techni=\r\nques meant for raising Kundalini forcefully (e.g. bandhas such as Jalandhar=\r\na bandha). But, with such techniques, one is playing with fire. Ramakrishna=\r\n Paramahamsa discouraged his disciples (e.g. Swami Abhedananda and Swami Yo=\r\ngananda) from Hatha yoga and other Raja yoga practices, telling them to sta=\r\ny away from practices that emphasize the body and to absorb the mind in god=\r\n&#39;a name instead. He said that realizng god through practices that emphasize=\r\n the body and its perfection, is nearly impossible in this age due to impur=\r\nities present everywhere, in food, water, air and thinking.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one =\r\npractices yama, niyama etc and attains perfect composure, then it may be po=\r\nssible to go into samadhi through the control of breathing. But it is unrea=\r\nlistic for most people. Suppose one has an ocean (samsaara) to cross and a =\r\nboat (body) is given to one. If one is close to the bank (liberation) , one=\r\n can just jump out of the boat and land on the bank. If one in the middle o=\r\nf an ocean jumps out of the boat, one will only sink in the ocean! In jnaan=\r\na yoga, bhakti yoga or karma yoga, one uses knowledge or faith or ability t=\r\no work without expectations as a rudder to steer the boat towards the bank.=\r\n In raaja yoga, one takes control like a raja (king) and just jumps out of =\r\nthe boat. That will work if one is close to the bank, i.e. already quite el=\r\nevated. Otherwise, just jumping out of the boat is very risky. Raja yoga re=\r\nquires a lot of preparation. One in Raja yoga practices needs a good guru t=\r\no gauge one&#39;s progress and prescribe the next steps at\n every stage. If som=\r\ne things are done too early, it may result in irreversible damage.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nBottomline: Use various praanaayaamas, kriyas and other exercises for physi=\r\ncal and emotional health and to create an environment conducive to spiritua=\r\nl sadhana. But do not be under an impression that you can realize god throu=\r\ngh such activities alone. That may have been possible in the past, but it n=\r\nearly impossible for most people today.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regarding cha=\r\nrging a lot of money for such things, one should realize that Ramakrishna a=\r\nnd Ramana maharshi stayed away from money for a reason. When Srila Prabhupa=\r\nda initiated so many people into mahamantra, he did not charge any fee. He =\r\nhad faith in Krishna and ended up building a really big organization, thoug=\r\nh he did not demand any fee for his lectures or initiations and did not kee=\r\np his teachings secretive.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If Ramakrishna Mutt is doing great servi=\r\nce even today, it is because the organization was built by Swami Vivekanand=\r\na, Swami Brahmananda, Swami Shivananda and Swami Premananda with a lot of s=\r\nattwa guna and they kept rajas and tamas at bay. They suffered in the begin=\r\nning and it took a long time to build, but it will last a long time. Things=\r\n built with tamas or rajas do not last too long and do not take people to g=\r\nod. One intending to build an organization to fulfil one&#39;s dharma should tr=\r\ny to ensure that sattwa drives the activities and not rajas or tamas. Usual=\r\nly, money brings rajas or even tamas into picture and that is why great mas=\r\nters have been wary.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There may be exceptions of course. All activit=\r\nies of a fully realized and liberated soul without any self-identification =\r\nare guided by sattwa. If such a person builds an organization based on sell=\r\ning divine knowledge, it means that Nature wanted him/her to sell divine kn=\r\nowledge for some reason. Such things are possible but rare. In general, you=\r\n see great souls like Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi and Srila Prabhupada ope=\r\nrating within their means and not charging for spiritual knowledge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      From cricket scores to your fri=\r\nends.

I occasion=\r\nally visit this forum. I happened to see several emails about AOL and the b=\r\nelow email from Shri. Narasimha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual p=\r\nractices and as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want to cl=\r\narify a few things to the extent of my understanding.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ther=\r\ne are several paths each leading to the destination of Sat-Chit-Ananda. Som=\r\ne are ritualistic, some use austerities, some use devotion, etc. AOL is a p=\r\nath, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. That does not make it in any=\r\n way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo would call it, it i=\r\ns a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly emerge into SatChitAn=\r\nanda. The personality of the sadhak is transformed slowly and the sadhak ra=\r\ndiates more and more as they progress more and more.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In my=\r\n experience, AOL is a seamless blend of Raja yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga =\r\nand Gnana yoga.\n Spritual practice in AOL is not just doing Sudarshan Kriya=\r\n everyday as it is commonly (mis)understood. Pranayams and Sudarshan Kriya =\r\nare done for cleansing and settling of the mind and preparing for meditatio=\r\nn and doing other spiritual practices of contemplation, Seva for rest of th=\r\ne day wit the right attitude. Regular practice of Sudarshan Kriya removes /=\r\n breaks old patterns and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; AOL includes some yoga asanas to =\r\nprepare the body (the Padma Sadhana sequence of asanas taught in DSN course=\r\n and Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar) taught in Part II or advance courses =\r\nfall under this category.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The raja yoga practices include =\r\nall the pranayams, Sudarshan Kriya, mudras, bandhas, meditations taught in =\r\nArt of Living course, advance courses, Sahaj samadhi meditation course, etc=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The Knowledge part includes deep contemplative study and=\r\n imbibing of Narada Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita a=\r\nnd\n Bhagavat Gita. Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very elaborate commentary =\r\non all of the above. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes=\r\n and the publicly available commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 D=\r\nVD episodes! Besides daily study of Yoga Vashishtam is highly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; recom=\r\nmended. Learning and contemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for those th=\r\nat strive to become Art of Living teachers.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The path of AO=\r\nL emphasises on Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama sanke=\r\nertan and bhajans are a standard feature of AOL satsangs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nSome wonder why AOL charges for these courses and some wonder about lack of=\r\n a Sadhguru at every stage.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let me clarify from my persona=\r\nl experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master living=\r\n in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of guiding millions of devotees =\r\nin every step of the sadhana without having to be near them in person.\n Sev=\r\neral get necessary guidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice),=\r\n some in person and several via various other ways. However, to get these g=\r\nuidance, an inner connection with the Master is essential. Until that stage=\r\n, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and in-depth commentaries on=\r\n various Knowledge are more than enough to guide disciples to a stage where=\r\n conscious inner communion with Guru can be established.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; S=\r\neveral of the senior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis of a=\r\n very high order capable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness at will du=\r\nring meditation. They may be not fully established in it like Sri Sri, but =\r\nact as channels of the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and wh=\r\nen needed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is very easy to accept those that left their=\r\n body as having achieved highest realization such as Sri Aurobindo or Sri R=\r\namakrishna or Ramana Maharishi. However it is a human tendency\n to doubt th=\r\nem when they are in physical form.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regarding AOL charging =\r\nmoney for its courses: AOL is world&#39;s largest volunteer run organization. N=\r\neither AOL teachers nor its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profi=\r\nts. All the proceeds go to the charitable activities again run by volunteer=\r\ns. Many of the full time teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and =\r\nmillions worth in property to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri R=\r\navishankar neither needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers including S=\r\nri Sri have went through very bad and sometimes even dangerous conditions t=\r\no bring the Knowledge to the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowle=\r\ndge needs to be revealed to maximum number of people.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Seni=\r\nor AOL teachers have faced danger to their lives by going without any help =\r\nor guidance to areas infested with naxalites, terrorists in North East, Kas=\r\nhmir, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. with\n nothing but love and =\r\nDivine Grace as their aid.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As far as I know, money is char=\r\nged in AOL courses for two reasons.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) Past experience sho=\r\nwed that those that paid for the courses seem to follow the practices more =\r\ndiligently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving person should be den=\r\nied a course because they cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part =\r\nof organizing several AOL courses and know first hand many cases where peop=\r\nle took courses for free and were also provided free accommodation, etc. Wh=\r\nenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from their ow=\r\nn pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and provide healing to the vi=\r\nctims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) =\r\nThis is my understanding and not AOl position. It removes the Karmic debt t=\r\no the AOL teachers and volunteers who still may have some doership in them.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Finally, Sri Sri is only\n interested in getting everyone =\r\nturn inwards and express the love, joy and compassion that is inside everyo=\r\nne. As long as one follows a path, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru,=\r\n we are happy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jai Gurudev!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Siva.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisd=\r\nom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedi=\r\nc-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, Narasimha P=\r\nVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There was some discussion on breathing exercises such as Su=\r\ndarshan kriya taught at AOL courses. I do not want to comment on specific c=\r\nourses or techniques, but will make a comment on Raja yoga practices in gen=\r\neral.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Breathing is a very important activity and =\r\nis connected to the balance between sympathetic and parasympathetic nervous=\r\n systems. It maintains the life force and\n emotional balance. Several breat=\r\nhing exercises are taught by various scriptures and traditions, such as pra=\r\nanaayaama taught by Baba Ramdev of Patanjali Yoga Foundation, Kriya yoga ta=\r\nught by Mahavatar Babaji and Paramahamsa Yogananda, Sudarsana kriya taught =\r\nby Art Of Living foundation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; All these fall under=\r\n Raja yoga, in the four-fold division of Jnaana, Bhakti, Karma and Raja yog=\r\nas. If these exercises are used as a means to regulate breathing and though=\r\nts upto some level and keep the body fit, it is fine. They are quite useful=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I was watching =\r\na nice TV program of a Baba who popularized praanaayaamas like kapaalabhaat=\r\ni and anuloma-viloma among Indian masses. He talked about breathing in and =\r\nout slowly and gradually reaching nirbeeja samadhi through it. I was amused=\r\n. Most people have too many (and quite firm) impurities in their subtle bod=\r\nies in the form of prior mental\n conditioning to be cleared just through br=\r\neathing exercises and to reach samadhi - nirbeeja or sabeeja - just by doin=\r\ng praanaayaama. However, I like the praanaayaamas he teaches. In fact, thin=\r\ngs like anuloma-viloma praanaayaama and kapaalabhaati are badly needed in t=\r\noday&#39;s stressed out world. However, I see this as something that relieves p=\r\nhysical and emotional stress and enables better spiritual sadhana, rather t=\r\nhan something that enables spiritual realization.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Of course, there are yogic techniques meant for raising Kundalini forceful=\r\nly (e.g. bandhas such as Jalandhara bandha). But, with such techniques, one=\r\n is playing with fire. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa discouraged his disciples (e=\r\n.g. Swami Abhedananda and Swami Yogananda) from Hatha yoga and other Raja y=\r\noga practices, telling them to stay away from practices that emphasize the =\r\nbody and to absorb the mind in god&#39;a name instead. He said that realizng go=\r\nd through practices that\n emphasize the body and its perfection, is nearly =\r\nimpossible in this age due to impurities present everywhere, in food, water=\r\n, air and thinking.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If one practices yama, niyama=\r\n etc and attains perfect composure, then it may be possible to go into sama=\r\ndhi through the control of breathing. But it is unrealistic for most people=\r\n. Suppose one has an ocean (samsaara) to cross and a boat (body) is given t=\r\no one. If one is close to the bank (liberation) , one can just jump out of =\r\nthe boat and land on the bank. If one in the middle of an ocean jumps out o=\r\nf the boat, one will only sink in the ocean! In jnaana yoga, bhakti yoga or=\r\n karma yoga, one uses knowledge or faith or ability to work without expecta=\r\ntions as a rudder to steer the boat towards the bank. In raaja yoga, one ta=\r\nkes control like a raja (king) and just jumps out of the boat. That will wo=\r\nrk if one is close to the bank, i.e. already quite elevated. Otherwise, jus=\r\nt jumping out of\n the boat is very risky. Raja yoga requires a lot of prepa=\r\nration. One in Raja yoga practices needs a good guru to gauge one&#39;s progres=\r\ns and prescribe the next steps at every stage. If some things are done too =\r\nearly, it may result in irreversible damage.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Bott=\r\nomline: Use various praanaayaamas, kriyas and other exercises for physical =\r\nand emotional health and to create an environment conducive to spiritual sa=\r\ndhana. But do not be under an impression that you can realize god through s=\r\nuch activities alone. That may have been possible in the past, but it nearl=\r\ny impossible for most people today.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Regarding charging a lot of money for such things, one s=\r\nhould realize that Ramakrishna and Ramana maharshi stayed away from money f=\r\nor a reason. When Srila Prabhupada initiated so many people into mahamantra=\r\n, he did not charge any fee. He had faith in Krishna and ended up building =\r\na really\n big organization, though he did not demand any fee for his lectur=\r\nes or initiations and did not keep his teachings secretive.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If Ramakrishna Mutt is doing great service even today, it is bec=\r\nause the organization was built by Swami Vivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, Sw=\r\nami Shivananda and Swami Premananda with a lot of sattwa guna and they kept=\r\n rajas and tamas at bay. They suffered in the beginning and it took a long =\r\ntime to build, but it will last a long time. Things built with tamas or raj=\r\nas do not last too long and do not take people to god. One intending to bui=\r\nld an organization to fulfil one&#39;s dharma should try to ensure that sattwa =\r\ndrives the activities and not rajas or tamas. Usually, money brings rajas o=\r\nr even tamas into picture and that is why great masters have been wary.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There may be exceptions of course. All activities of=\r\n a fully realized and liberated soul without any self-identification are\n g=\r\nuided by sattwa. If such a person builds an organization based on selling d=\r\nivine knowledge, it means that Nature wanted him/her to sell divine knowled=\r\nge for some reason. Such things are possible but rare. In general, you see =\r\ngreat souls like Ramakrishna, Ramana Maharshi and Srila Prabhupada operatin=\r\ng within their means and not charging for spiritual knowledge.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;!--4--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Keep =\r\nup with people you care about with Yahoo!
