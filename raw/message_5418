Naths are also known as Mahasiddhas. These are not ordinary beings. Nath means Lord or master. Depending on how you count them, there are either 64 or 9 of them, incarnated from various transcendental qualities of the Lord. These are adept beings with perfect mastery over various aspects of the field of duality. They are ever-liberated and yet are born again and again to show the path of liberation to people.\n \nLord Dattatreya is the original guru of all Naths. Please read his &quot;Avadhoota Gita&quot;. There is a nice English translation by Swami Asokananda (I think) of Ramakrishna Mutt, which does justice. But, it is better if one knows Sanskrit and reads Sanskrit verses directly, because there is some special power in the combinations of words used and reading them in that form has a special impact. If one reads Avadhoota Gita, one will realize that what I&#39;ve been writing on the goal of sadhana is consistent with what Avadhoota Gita says. So is it with what Maharshi Vasishtha says in Yoga Vaasishtham!\n \nWhile Dattatreya says &quot;I am this body, I am that body and I am all bodies and yet I am not a body&quot;, it is unwise to think that Gorakshanath (from Dattatreya&#39;s lineage!) would set as ultimate goal making a specific body immortal. This is a gross misrepresentation of Gorakshanath and his teachings. In fact, anynody who thinks one can understand the essence of a Nath&#39;s teaching from a book or a verse is fooling oneself. Only those who are meant for it can benefit from the guidance of a Nath. Others can only see the superficial aspects of the words attributed to a Nath. To say that Gorakhnath&#39;s path is about achieving &quot;Kayasiddhi&quot; is totally wrong. Gorakshanath&#39;s path is about liberation while living, which is described in Avadhoota Gita, Yoga Vaasishtham and several other scriptures, and that does NOT mean physical immortality.\n \nOne understanding the true essence of the teachings of Gorakshanath, Matsyendranath and Dattatreya and following their teachings perfectly may indeed get various siddhis though one may not actively want them. As Vasishtha says in Yoga Vaasishtham, various siddhis in the field of duality are irrelevant to a seeker of liberation and they can even become hindrances. But, one truly understanding the teachings of Naths and Dattatreya will not succumb to them and will become like Shiva. My point is that one who starts off thinking that physical immoortality of a specific physical body (or another siddhi like that) is the goal is going to get stuck at some stage.\n \nLiberation is lack of attraction or aversion to anything in the field of duality - an object or an idea or a notion. Either rejection of everything as an illusion or acceptance of everything as divine can make one eventually overcome all attractions and aversions. Thinking of immortalizing one particular physical body will not help one with that. In fact, a realized person will not think &quot;I am this body&quot;, as the quote above from Dattatreya shows.\n \nIn fact, the verse quoted below says one becomes like Shiva in the end. Did Shiva strive for physical immortality? When Shiva came to earth as Adi Shankara, he did not teach physical immortality. Instead, he taught that body is mithya (an illusion).\n \nAs I said, siddhas like Trilinga Swami could manifest their physical bodies in two places at the same time. Why Trilinga Swami, my guru&#39;s guru (Sri Nakhate Maharaj) did that. Oneday, my guru Manish saw his guru standing in front of him in physical body, showing hand in a blessing pose and then waving it as a good bye sign. Manish later found out that other disciples of Nakhate maharaj living in various parts of the world saw a similar scene at the same time and that Maharaj gave up his physical body in Pune at that time! If one is indeed a siddha (let alone a natha) and has some control over matter, it may be possible to menifest and unmanifest perishable physical bodies at will. Where does physical immortality stand in that context?!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaskar,\n&gt;\n&gt; Just a thought on the path of Gorakhnath.

The method is not known, but could only be related to development of Will-Power, as Manipura is the center for will power.

But you are going to the other extreme when suggesting that physical immortality is the highest ideal. Neither viewpoint is correct.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ignoring the views of a stereotypical psudo-vedantin of today, we can see that vedanta in fact does not say physical body is to be ignored. It asks us *realize* that we are not the physical body and we are something else residing in a shell called the physical body. What we truly are, can neither be created nor be destroyed, though physical body may perish. But, if someone currently thinks that one is a physical body, one cannot simply ignore the physical body. One has to *use* the physical body to eventually realize that one is not the physical body. A mere intellectual statement of it is not tantamount to its realization.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Yoga Vaasishtham, Maharshi Vasishtha clearly says that action (karma) and knowledge (jnaana) are two wings with which the bird of individualized consciousness flies into the sky of self-realization. Physical body is not to be ignored, but to be used skillfully and carefully to perform the *right actions* that can free one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I said earlier, one performing actions without correct knowledge (that god is the doer of all actions!) is like a person who is walking around a mountain not realizing that the goal of walking is to reach the top. Such a person will keep walking forever and not reach the top. On the other hand, one having the correct knowledge but not performing actions is like someone who knows that reaching the top of the mountain is the goal and keeps staring at the top, without walking. Such a person will remain at the base of the mountain. Thus, jnaana and karma alone are not able to free one and that is why Vasishtha compares them to two wings of a bird. The equilibrium caused by action and knowledge is what takes us towards liberation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physical bodies of some siddhas may indeed remain intact for a long time, like centuries or millennia. But, eventually, they too may give up physical body. Someone mentioned Vallalar, but he gave up physical body, didn&#39;t he?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, to a truly liberated siddha, this discussion of physical immortality will sound silly. Self is uncreated and indestructible, but its modifications such as physical forms can be born and be destroyed at will really. A siddha, as long as one does not merge in Brahman completely, can remain in an individualized *ethereal* body with a subtle ego, even after giving up a physical body. One can then create a physical body at will, then merge back in the ethereal body after a few decades or centuries or millennia and so on. So, what is the whole point of physical immortality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Trilinga Swami (aka Telang Swami) of Kashi was a perfected Siddha. He was a guru-bhai of Vimalananda. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa commented during a visit to Varanasi that Trilinga Swami was Shiva himself. Bhairavi Brahmani who came to Dakshineshwar and taught Tantra to Ramakrishna was in the lineage of Trilinga Swami. Later, a grateful Ramakrishna revisited Kashi and fed Trilinga Swami a big container full of rice pudding with his own hands! During his imprisonment by the British (for walking naked in Kashi), he was seen by some guards to be in his cell and also walking on the prison compound wall at the same time. Even when he finally decided to give up his body and his disciples put his body in a container and threw it into Ganges, he was seen after a few minutes to walk on the other side.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a realized being with a high enough command over duality, creation and destruction of physical body is not a big deal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who thinks that a gold coin is special and needs to be preserved forever will struggle to do so. One who realizes that a gold coin, a gold chain, a gold ring, a golden arrow etc are all basically the same (gold) can melt the coin and recreate it again. Preserving the coin forever is an irrelevant goal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The key point is this. Trilinga Swami did not get those abilities because he wanted them or did a sadhana for them specifically.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The same non-dual Self fills us all. Whether X realizes non-dual Self or Y realizes non-dual Self, the realization is the same. But, if one retains individual ego-consciousness and interacts with the field of duality, different possibilities are there. One may engage in various actions using a physical body and at the end drop the ego-consciousness and merge in Brahman. Or, one may engage in various actions using a physical body, then give it up and tie the ego-consciousness to an ethereal body and remain in a higher realm for a long time. If so, one may re-enter a physical body from time to time. But, all this is governed by one&#39;s caliber and evolution in the field of duality. Though, all are the same at the non-dual level, different beings have different caliber in the field of duality. A rishi or Vishnu or a siddha or a natha may not be the same as somebody else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like Aurobindo, but I am afraid he lent himself vulnerable to misinterpretation when it comes to divinization of matter. I say quite emphatically that physical immortality as an ideal and as the end goal of one&#39;s sadhana is a dangerous idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only worthy goal is to efface individual ego, realize Self and, if needed, engage with the world with a subtle ego and do whatever comes spontaneously. Once heavier conditioning is overcome, Nature starts to show one the role one has to play. One should just play the role given to one well, instead of asking for this role or that role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
