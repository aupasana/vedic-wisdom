I had started the \nNavaratri Puja of The =\r\nMother with Kalasam. As I have not been \ninitiated into the pooja vidhanam =\r\nand only had the fortune of \nwitnessing the ritualistic pooja done by my mo=\r\nther-in-law according \nto Sri sooktam. Unfortunately I was not a great fan =\r\nof rituals then. \nI live abroad and downloaded the pooja vidhanam according=\r\n to sri \nsooktam and started my pooja. I found that it was pertaining to \nD=\r\nurga and the shodasopachara pooja and the pranapratishta. The Devi \nKavacha=\r\nm and the Sapta sloki are also included. When I started the \npooja I wonder=\r\ned if I could chant and perform the pooja as it was a \npart of Saptashati. =\r\nMy father-in-law advised me not to do it as I \nwas not initiated. But havin=\r\ng started and I also strongly believe \nthat Mother would not &#39;harm&#39; her chi=\r\nld=C2=A0 I have continued with Her \nGrace. I have always wanted to do Sapta=\r\nShati parayanam during the \nsarannaNavaratras. How can I correct my swara? =\r\nAs I\n&gt;  am not very familiar with Sanskrit and afraid of not doing it \nprop=\r\nerly, is there a way?

If you look at the nights before Vij=\r\naya Dasami, then \nthere are ten nights instead of nine this year. This happ=\r\nens \nsometimes.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If you live on US east coast, then Chaturthi com=\r\nes twices on \nThursday and Friday (Oct 2 & 3). It lasted the entire Thursda=\r\ny and \nextended into Friday. Panchami was on Saturday (Oct 4). Shashthi was=\r\n \non Sunday (Oct 5). Ashtami is on Tuesday (Oct 8). Navami is on \nWednesday=\r\n (Oct 9). Dasami is on Thursday (Oct 10).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If one&#39;s parents did n=\r\not do a proper &quot;anna praasana&quot; ritual (the \nritual of first feeding of soli=\r\nd food to a baby) to one, should one \nconsider oneself not entitled to eat =\r\nany solid food? Not doing a \nmantra because of no initiation is basically l=\r\nike that.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Getting initiation is good, especially if the one init=\r\niating has \nsome level of sadhana in that mantra. But it is neither necessa=\r\nry \nnor sufficient for making progress in your own sadhana.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If y=\r\nou see my homam document, I gave an analogy for this. A \nmillionaire may op=\r\nen a bank account in his son&#39;s name with a \nstarting balance of a million d=\r\nollars. This is akin to a good guru \ninitiating a sishya in a mantra. Sishy=\r\na starts off by getting some \nof guru&#39;s attainment. But the son may waste t=\r\nhose million dollars \nand end up with nothing. Similarly the sishya may fal=\r\nl and not \nachieve anything. Another person may not have anyone to give mon=\r\ney \nand may start off with a zero bank balance but accumulate millions \nof =\r\ndollars with own effort. This is akin to=C2=A0a person doing sadhana \nwith =\r\na mantra without guru and attaining some level in the mantra.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; So=\r\nme people hold the view that mantras cannot be chanted without a \nproper &quot;i=\r\nnitiation&quot; . This view is especially prevalent in some \nsections of society=\r\n w.r.t. navarna mantra. However, I disagree with \nthat view.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If =\r\nyou know the mantra (!), just chant it. What would an \ninitiating guru have=\r\n done for you? Perhaps he would&#39;ve given some of \nhis attainment in the man=\r\ntra to you. Well, you can do it yourself if \nyou work hard. Or a guru would=\r\n&#39;ve taught you the right nyasas to be \ndone before the mantra. Well, you ca=\r\nn get the nyasas from books too. \nMoreover, what most people do today for n=\r\nyasas is anyway just a \nritual with no meaning. Nyasa literally means place=\r\nment. You place \nvarious sounds in various body parts (like the tips of var=\r\nious \nfingers, heart, top of head, eyes etc). People merely act out some \ns=\r\nignals while saying the sounds. This &quot;placement&quot; is actually \nsupposed to b=\r\ne an internal act and it creates an ideal environment \nfor the repetition o=\r\nf mantra. Due to the external actions, what is \nsupposed to occur internall=\r\ny does not occur in most. So the sounds \nend up not getting properly placed=\r\n in the body. In other words, what \nI am trying to say is that most people =\r\ndo\n&gt;  not know how to &quot;place&quot; various &quot;sounds&quot; in various body parts. \nThey=\r\n merely perform meaningless ritualistic actions. So, if you do \nnot know ny=\r\nasas, you are not really missing much compared to others \nwho were initiate=\r\nd.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; In my humble opinion, the most important qualification is to =\r\nhave \ndevotion and sense of surrender to Her. If you have them, you can \nco=\r\nnsider yourself &quot;highly initiated&quot;.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; =\r\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ----\n-----\n&gt;=\r\n Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pit=\r\nri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \ntarpana\n&gt; Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (=\r\nMP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows=\r\n): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: ht=\r\ntp://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- ----\n----- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: Cha=\r\nndra Prakash \n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; Sent: Sunday, October=\r\n 05, 2008 11:16 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Navaratri...\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Narasim=\r\nha,\n&gt; \n&gt; When does Navratri end?
