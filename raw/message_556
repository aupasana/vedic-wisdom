The is what they do traditionally.\n\nHowever, according to my guru also, a true shata chandi homam involves doing \n108 Chandi homas (108 priests doing once each or 12 priests doing 9 times \neach or 6 priests doing 18 times each etc).\n\nWhatever name we use for it, chanting 108 times and doing 9 or 10 or 11 \nhomas is also a very good thing. But doing in the fire is more powerful than \nchanting.\n\n(2) Pronunciation is important. But love, devotion, humility and surrender \nto the deity are as important if not more important.\n\nSwami Sathasivom (http://www.swamisathasivom.org/), the head priest of \nKalikambal temple in Chennai, is a rare priest I have seen. His surrender to \nKaali, his disinterest in material things, his ability to see the Real \nwithout being deluded by what is on the surface, the sincerity with which he \ndoes his poojas and homas, the way he works hard for others at the cost of \nhis own health (without any expectations and with just love for all), his \nlack of ego and the childlike simplicity and innocence he has are \nunimaginable in today&#39;s age. He is a combination of a priest, a bhakta and a \nyogi, a class of people who were once common but fast disappearing in this \nage!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;ashwinrawal&quot; &lt;ashwinrawal@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, October 19, 2008 10:21 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Shatchandi Yagna (Homam)\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narsimhaji,\n&gt; 1. I had arranged one Shatchandi Homam at Ambica Temple in 2003 wherein\n&gt; Acharya of the Homam read 108 Saptashati Stotra path within 9 days\n&gt; arranging 3 Brahmins at the temple and on the 10th day a Homam was\n&gt; arranged with 9 Brahmins like Navchandi Homam. This way he read 108\n&gt; Saptashati Stotra Path (Pathatmaka)and last Homam with 9 Homatmaka.\n&gt; After some time one Acharya told me that this was not Shatchandi Homam.\n&gt; Actually in Shatchandi there should be 108 Brahmins at a time and 108\n&gt; Yagna-kundas should be created.\n&gt; Sir, what is the right procedure for Shatchandi Homam?\n&gt; 2. Do you refer anybody in South India whom I can call to Gujarat to do\n&gt; this type of big Homam? This is because in this present time such\n&gt; learned Acharyas are rare. Most of the Brahmins are doing path\n&gt; stereotype without any love or devotion here. I have seen some good\n&gt; pronounces in South Indians.\n&gt; Dr. Ashwin Rawal\n\n\n"}}
