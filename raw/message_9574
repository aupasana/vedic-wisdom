I had trouble falling asleep, because I could he=\r\nar strange noises -  creaking and something moving in the attic. I&#39;m very s=\r\nensitive to different energies - I don&#39;t see anything, but I feel whether s=\r\nomething divine or rather evil is present in a certain place. That place di=\r\ndn&#39;t feel good to me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I was staying there for 10 days and every nigh=\r\nt I would make up because of a feeling of somebody staring at me - I could =\r\nsee them but once I started focusing on them, they vanished. Sometimes I wo=\r\nuld wake up in a terrified state breathing rapidly. One day I could definit=\r\nely hear some steps near the bed and a roar. I reached for my flashlight to=\r\n see nothing.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;This doesn&#39;t seem like sleep paralysis to me - I insta=\r\nntly become fully aware and I can move my body.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Can it be that spiri=\r\nts live in that place disturbing my sleep? There were a few more people sta=\r\nying at that place and everybody had severe problems with sleep, so it&#39;s no=\r\nt just me.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;On the last night I chanted Sri Rudram at that place befo=\r\nre going to sleep and this was the only night I was able to sleep properly.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Upon coming back home from that place I started waking up at home, =\r\nfeeling some strong presence - usually some short beings (up to 50 cm in he=\r\night, I&#39;ve seen them before here though); Once the sun rises, all of the st=\r\nrange feelings disappear and I can sleep peacefully.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Is there any ma=\r\nntra that will protect me from all kinds of astral beings at night? Somethi=\r\nng that I can chant before going to sleep. This has been bothering me for s=\r\nome time now and it interferes with my life.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Thank you in advance!\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
