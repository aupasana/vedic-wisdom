He was also very well read and used to read the =\r\ndaily\nnewspapers. In one of the newspapers of the early 1930&#39;s he read an a=\r\nrticle\nabout Ramana Maharshi, who was said to be a Self-realized man living=\r\n in\nTiruvannamalai. He cut out the article with an intention to visit Sri\nR=\r\namanasramam. He tried his best but could not make it. He kept that cutting\n=\r\nfor few years and then showed it to his son, Hari Chand Khanna, who was the=\r\nn\nliving in Kanpur, working for the Oriental Insurance Company.\n\nMy father =\r\nHari Chand Khanna was born in the year 1905 in a small village\ncalled Satgh=\r\nara, which is now part of Pakistan. He was a hard working man.\nHe first wor=\r\nked for the Indian railways and then joined an Insurance\ncompany.\n\nOne summ=\r\ner vacation, my uncle from Bibana, Madhya Pradesh, invited my father\nto com=\r\ne with his family for a visit. My uncle was then serving in the\nRailways in=\r\n Bibana. My father agreed to the proposal and our family visited\nmy uncle. =\r\nAfter two days in Bibana my father made inquiries as to how to\nreach Tiruva=\r\nnnamalai and then set out on his own, leaving our family with my\nuncle. If =\r\nmy memory serves me right, this took place in 1939.\n\nOn reaching Kanpur my =\r\nfather smashed all the liquor bottles and liquor\nglasses in his possession.=\r\n He had always been an outgoing man, but now he\nstarted spending much more =\r\ntime at home reading Ramana&#39;s books and in\nmeditation.\n\nWe used to spend al=\r\nmost a month at the Ashram. I was six or seven when we\nfirst started visiti=\r\nng the Ashram. At that time Bhagavan&#39;s brother,\nNiranjanananda Swami, was t=\r\nhe sarvadhikari looking after the Ashram.\n\nDuring those early visits, I rem=\r\nember that every night we would find father\nmissing from his bed. Then he w=\r\nould return in the morning, saying he was\nwith Bhagavan through the night, =\r\nand if Bhagavan didn&#39;t sleep, he also kept\nawake. He considered it the grea=\r\ntest good fortune to be able to spend his\nnights with his Guru in the Old H=\r\nall.\n\nOften large bus loads of pilgrims would come to Tiruvannamalai during=\r\n the\nnight for Bhagavan&#39;s darshan. The pilgrims would wait until dawn for t=\r\nhe\ndoors of the Old Hall to be opened. When Bhagavan noticed that, he asked=\r\n the\nsarvadhikari to keep the doors open all the time. After that the doors=\r\n to\nhis room were kept open all the time. Devotees would enter through one =\r\ndoor,\nhave darshan and exit from the other door.\n\nOur annual visits went on=\r\n for some years, but then were suspended for a few\nyears for reasons unknow=\r\nn to me, though my father was in constant touch with\nthe Ashram. When again=\r\n we resumed the annual visits to the Ashram, my father\nwould sometimes carr=\r\ny bottles of the Ayurvedic medicine (Mahanarayan oil)\nfor Bhagavan. Bhagava=\r\nn had rheumatism in his legs and could not walk\nproperly. No sooner was Bha=\r\ngavan given the bottles of medicine than he would\nannounce then and there t=\r\nhat Khanna has brought Mahanarayan Oil, which\nrelieves pain in the legs, an=\r\nd anyone with pain in their legs could make\nfree use of the same.\n\nIn those=\r\n days the Ashram&#39;s financial condition was not good. My father would\nsend m=\r\noney to the Ashram regularly when there was a need.\n\nAt the Ashram I rememb=\r\ner feeling very happy when Bhagavan played with my\nyounger sister Kusum, wh=\r\no was then maybe a year old. Bhagavan would hold one\nend of his staff, whil=\r\ne Kusum played with the other. Bhagavan would laugh\nand pull the staff away=\r\n as the child reached out for it. Bhagavan used to\ncall her Jhansi Ki Rani,=\r\n after the courageous queen of Jhansi, who died\nfighting the British in the=\r\n first war of independence in 1857. Afterwards, I\nused to tease Kusum with =\r\nthat name.\n\nImmediately after Ramana Maharshi&#39;s Mahanirvana, my father rush=\r\ned to the\ntown and bought a very large, beautiful garland for Bhagavan&#39;s bo=\r\ndy. When he\nreached the Ashram, a dispute between different groups was goin=\r\ng on as to\nwho would be the first to garland the Maharshi&#39;s body. On seeing=\r\n my father,\nboth the Brahmins and non Brahmins amicably settled that Khanna=\r\n, one of the\noldest and staunchest devotees, must be allowed to garland Bha=\r\ngavan&#39;s body\nfirst. Thus my father was the first to garland the deceased bo=\r\ndy of Ramana.\n\nMy father always used to say that all his desires have been =\r\nfulfilled by God\nand that his last one wish was to die at his Father&#39;s Feet=\r\n, Arunachala. I\nused to question as to how that is possible because he is a=\r\n karma yogi and\nalways in Kanpur. My father would always reply: &quot;We will se=\r\ne.&quot; In spite of\nthis, I was stunned when my father passed away at the Ashra=\r\nm in good health.\n\nFuneral rites were performed by me and others from the A=\r\nshram. The Ashram\nhas honored him with a samadhi within the Ashram compound=\r\n, and a yearly puja\nis done by the Ashram at his tomb.\n\nDuring his life, my=\r\n father&#39;s earnest desire was to explain Bhagavan&#39;s\nteachings to all who vis=\r\nited him at his house in Kanpur. He considered\nBhagavan&#39;s teachings to be t=\r\nhe simplest and the best. He also stressed that\nif one wanted to lead a hap=\r\npy and contented life, then the only way was to\nfollow the teachings of Sri=\r\n Bhagavan. Also, whenever he visited someone, he\nwould explain the same. He=\r\n used to tell everyone, and especially his\nchildren, not to be outgoing but=\r\n to turn inward and enjoy one&#39;s true\nnature. He used to impress upon his ch=\r\nildren not to strive for material\nwealth, which one has to leave behind aft=\r\ner death, but instead to aspire for\nthe real, everlasting spiritual wealth,=\r\n as taught by Sri Bhagavan Ramana.\n\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/news=\r\nletters/2000/?pg=3Djan-feb\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=\r\n=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd11274dd663d0482af64f8\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nRanvir wrote the following memoirs about his father and his own =\r\nearly visits to Sri Ramanasramam before he was absorbed into the Feet of hi=\r\ns Master on April 8, 1999.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;MY=\r\n grandfather was a very religious man known to sing bhajans the whole night=\r\n long.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0He was also very well read and used to read the daily ne=\r\nwspapers.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;In one of the newspapers o=\r\nf the early 1930&#39;s he read an article about Ramana Maharshi, who was sa=\r\nid to be a Self-realized man living in Tiruvannamalai.
