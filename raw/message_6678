Leave all the theory aside, mind is a monkey and it will jump over,=\r\n so you dotn have to follow any thought. OCD means a compulsive monkey.\n\n2.=\r\n Do 20 min homam daily, pick ur favourite god, choose one simple mantra, of=\r\nfer in fire atleast 108 times with full love and devotion. Do it regularly =\r\nfor 3-4 months\n\n3. Choose a good homeopathy. there is a site abchomeoapthy =\r\nwhere\nbrisbanehomeopath gives free consultations and you can post ur querie=\r\ns daily, he will help you out.\n\n4. Bach flower remedies for OCD is combinat=\r\nion of Cherryplum + Whitechestnut. if you want detailed analysis respond on=\r\n my personal id.\n\n5. Join a group lalkitab_remedies and post your birth det=\r\nails, remedies for your problems as per your chart will be given. \n\n6. Your=\r\n reality is reflection of your karma, with medicines you can contorl and ch=\r\nange it upto a certain extent. Only with intense sadhana you can change you=\r\nr Karma and reality itself. such is the power of intense sadhana. 20-30min =\r\nof homam is indeed equivalent to 4-5hrs of intense meditation. PVR said thi=\r\ns some time back, i doubted it at that time but when i did it i realised it=\r\n was correct.\n\nregards\npriyank\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;as1=\r\n6475&quot; &lt;as16475@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear sir,\n&gt; namskar\n&gt; There was a time when =\r\nI didnt use to have my meals before thanking god. I used to remember god 24=\r\n hors a day. But in 1990 I started fearing god and now I hate him so much s=\r\no that I destroyed my home made temple and his posters. why i did so the re=\r\nason is as below:\n&gt; I am suffering from ocd (Obsessive compulsive disorder)=\r\n since 1990. My problem is that whenever I am doing some work some part of =\r\nmy mind says that if this work gets done I will go to temple but it is not =\r\nme and I counter this thought by saying that I will not go to temple. But a=\r\nt the completion of the work I am compelled to go to temple. The problem is=\r\n that I have to go to temple compulsively and many times again and again. A=\r\nlso the temple which comes to my thoughts has to be visited to satisfy my c=\r\nompulsion. Even a simple thought that if my son answers the question I will=\r\n go to temple. I am not even able to teach him. I cant cross the road where=\r\n there is a temple. How can I avoid that. There are temples all around the =\r\nworld. Please help me out. For past 10 yrs I am taking allopathy medicine. =\r\nFor past 7 months I am taking homeopathy also. But sometimes it goes out of=\r\n control. Please guide me how can I stop hating GOD. \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Dob :1=\r\n6th april,1975\n&gt; Place:  kangra (Himachal Pradesh)\n&gt; Time : 8 pm\n&gt; \n&gt; a\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
