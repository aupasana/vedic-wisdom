My point on *sme=\r\nlly* was not pertaining to the menses but to the fact that if devatas are i=\r\nndeed repelled by the odor of menses, then why is it not applicable to peop=\r\nle who are not really clean/hygiene.\n\nMenses are indeed powerful and in som=\r\ne aghora sadhanas has its use.\n\nThanks & Regards\nNarayan\n\n--- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com, Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Actually, a w=\r\noman&#39;s prana shakti is much stronger during her time of menses.\n&gt; If a woma=\r\nn does manasika japa during this time, it is multiple orders more\n&gt; powerfu=\r\nl. In certain paths of sadhana (Matangi worship, for example), woman\n&gt; is a=\r\nt her most auspicious when she is menstruating. So to compare this state\n&gt; =\r\nto a person being smelly or sweaty is, I think, a mischaracterization.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Yes, there are elements of ritual impurity. But it is also true that the\n&gt;=\r\n time of menstruation is a time ofi inner purification and cleansing (on a\n=\r\n&gt; physicial and spiritual level) for women that men (unfortunately for them=\r\n)\n&gt; do not have access to. In a way, external sadhana is required for men t=\r\no\n&gt; obtain the fruits of the automatic purification women attain through\n&gt; =\r\nmenstruation.\n&gt; \n&gt; That is another reason why women are advised to take com=\r\nplete rest during\n&gt; their menses--not that they&#39;re going to contaminate eve=\r\nrything around them,\n&gt; but the process of cleansing going on within is a su=\r\nbtle and sensitive\n&gt; process that is optimized when a woman can fully rest.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, a woman&#39;s work never ends, so this practice is a way of ensurin=\r\ng women\n&gt; get their much needed rest, including rest from sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; I j=\r\nust wanted to add this, because I think sometimes women get the wrong\n&gt; imp=\r\nression that they are somehow debased or otherwise inauspicious during\n&gt; th=\r\neir time of menstruation and therefore kept away fromthe privilege of\n&gt; doi=\r\nng worship. But that is a very crude view and I think the more nuanced\n&gt; un=\r\nderstanding that our ancient rishis (and yoginis) had was that this is a\n&gt; =\r\nspecial time for women when external sadhana is not required since internal=\r\n\n&gt; cleansing is going on and a time when her energies and kundalini are\n&gt; n=\r\naturally sensitized and heightened, so special care should be taken.\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\nlso, there is no restriction on doing manasika japa (without moving the\n&gt; l=\r\nips) for a woman during this time.\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Aug 28, 2009 at 10:29 AM, v=\r\nedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear narayana,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nThank you for this knowledge.

They don=\r\n&#39;t eat with the\n&gt; &gt; mouth as we do, and they have a powerful sense of smell=\r\n and can detect the\n&gt; &gt; menses, which irritates them causing them to go, wh=\r\nich obviously defeats the\n&gt; &gt; purpose of inviting/invoking them!
