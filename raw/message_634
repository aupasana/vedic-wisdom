It IS possible.\n\nBelieve=\r\n me, all it takes for Her is a split second to turn a fool into a \nself-rea=\r\nlized person.\n\nYou will do yourself a big favor if you take the thoughts of=\r\n &quot;extraordinary \nexperiences&quot; off your mind. These expectations are a big o=\r\nbstacle.\n\nIf you normally feel sad or angry or upset when someone criticize=\r\ns you badly \nand you are now able to feel normal in that situation, isn&#39;t t=\r\nhat a \n&quot;tangible&quot; sign of progress? If you normally feel elated when someon=\r\ne \npraises you to the sky and you are now able to feel normal in that \nsitu=\r\nation, isn&#39;t that a &quot;tangible&quot; sign of progress?\n\nInstead of focusing your =\r\nsenses outward and looking for some miracle or an \n&quot;extraordinaty experienc=\r\ne&quot;, focus your senses inward, watch your thoughts \nand instincts closely an=\r\nd refine them. Try to reach a state where criticism \nand praise are the sam=\r\ne for you.\n\nThat will put you in a good stead. THAT is real progress. If yo=\r\nu make real \nprogress and do not bother about any &quot;extraordinary experience=\r\ns&quot; , you may \nindeed have an extraordinary experience oneday! Not the one t=\r\nhat gets you \nstuck with a sense of possessiveness or entitlement, but the =\r\none that frees \nyou.\n\n&gt; If i think rationally and take the experiences of o=\r\nthers than it is\n&gt; quite clear that the spiritual growth invariably comes a=\r\nlong with\n&gt; some out of the world and tangiable experiences. this some time=\r\ns\n&gt; temporarily disappoints me.\n\nOne can get stuck in some expectations tha=\r\nt are unknowingly formed in the \nmind based on what one read or heard.\n\nOne=\r\n can get stuck in possessiveness or a sense of entitlement over an \n&quot;extrao=\r\nrdinary experience&quot; that actually happened to him.\n\nOne can get stuck in ma=\r\nny ways.\n\nIf you do not want to get stuck, have no expectations. Have no se=\r\nnse of \nownership over anything. Surrender to Her fully, not because it wil=\r\nl give X \nor Y or Z, but because everything is really Hers. Keep looking at=\r\n yourself \nand your own actions/thoughts and refine them to make the sense =\r\nof surrender \nfuller and fuller. And expect to get nothing from Her in retu=\r\nrn for that \nsurrender. That is a surefire way to succeed in one&#39;s spiritua=\r\nl pursuit.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.or=\r\ng/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJ=\r\nC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- - \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal=\r\n pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\nSen=\r\nt: Monday, November 10, 2008 11:59 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri=\r\n THAKUR is still alive today\n\nNamaste Garu,\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are attracted to Th=\r\nakur and his teachings, benefit from\n&gt;them.

It is als=\r\no possible that\nneither is\n&gt; Thakur.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bottomline is that it does not rea=\r\nlly matter!\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are attracted to Thakur and his teachings, benefit f=\r\nrom\nthem. Beings\n&gt; like Thakur are born out of free volition and out of com=\r\npassion for\nother\n&gt; beings. They are the playmates of the Mother and are re=\r\nborn as a\npart of Her\n&gt; plan. They are born to show the path to others. How=\r\never, there are\nmany\n&gt; paths. In each life, they may take up a different mi=\r\nssion and\ndemonstrate\n&gt; different paths to people through their teachings a=\r\nnd deeds. If you\nlike the\n&gt; teachings of such a being in a specific birth, =\r\ndue to some rina\nwith the\n&gt; path taught in that birth, follow the teachings=\r\n of that birth. Who\nelse the\n&gt; same being was in other births is not that r=\r\nelevant or useful.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are attracted to the teachings of any saint -=\r\n Ramakrishna\nParamahamsa\n&gt; or Shriram Sharma Acharya or Yogeshwar ji or Ram=\r\nana Maharshi or\nAurobindo or\n&gt; Srila Prabhupada or Akkalkot Maharaj or Sai =\r\nBaba or Kabir or\nSamartha\n&gt; Ramadas or Jnaneshwar Maharaj or Chaitanya Maha=\r\nprabhu or\nRamanujacharya or\n&gt; Raghavedra Swami or Gautama Buddha or Jesus C=\r\nhrist or whoever,\nfollow the\n&gt; teachings of that saint and benefit from the=\r\nm. Other speculative\nthings\n&gt; about them may be interesting, but can turn o=\r\nut to be a mere\ndistraction.\n&gt;\n&gt; Find the teachings and path that attracts =\r\nyou the most. Read the\nteachings.\n&gt; More importantly, try to *walk* the pat=\r\nh. Imbibe the teachings in\nyour\n&gt; thinking and in your common sense. Your a=\r\nctions and thoughts should\nreflect\n&gt; the teachings. Focus on the teachings =\r\nof the saint, digest them\nfully and\n&gt; base your thoughts and actions on the=\r\nm.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding Ramakrishna, I want to say one thing. The extent=\r\n to which\nhe\n&gt; imbibed the upanishadic philosophy in his thoughts and actio=\r\nns, the\ndepth of\n&gt; his sense of surrender to the Mother and the absolute la=\r\nck of\npersonal ego\n&gt; in him are the real miracles to me. Other miracles are=\r\n useful to\ninstill\n&gt; faith and confidence in some people. But they do not d=\r\no justice to\nhis\n&gt; personality. In fact, Swami Vivekananda was very conscio=\r\nus of\npossibly\n&gt; limiting Thakur&#39;s personality to a bunch of miracles and w=\r\nas\nconcerned if\n&gt; books on him would be able to do justice to his personali=\r\nty.\n&gt;\n&gt; If Ramakrishna Paramahamsa tranformed a bunch of youngsters into\nsp=\r\niritual\n&gt; giants who affected the spirituality of generations and if Srila\n=\r\nPrabhupada\n&gt; transformed many fallen souls into excellent saints who change=\r\nd the\nworld,\n&gt; it was possible because of their *total* surrender to the Lo=\r\nrd and\nthe\n&gt; zeroness of their personal ego. *That* is a true miracle.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nI do not want to downplay the discussion of other tangible\nmiracles. But I\n=\r\n&gt; do not want people to lose track of the crux of the matter.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramakrish=\r\nna could do miracles because he had no ego and surrendered\nfully to\n&gt; Her. =\r\n*She* did everything for him.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I said earlier, a person with normal e=\r\ngo can do some things; a\nperson\n&gt; with very little personal ego can do trem=\r\nendous things; and, a\nperson with\n&gt; *no* personal ego can do *any* thing. O=\r\nur goal should be to\neradicate\n&gt; personal ego through constant vigilance an=\r\nd total surrender.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ gro=\r\nup/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comc=\r\nast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; -----=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Orig=\r\ninal Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic=\r\n-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, November 09, 2008 3:07 PM\n&gt; Subj=\r\nect: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste=\r\n,\n&gt;\n&gt; one Gayatri Upaasaka told me many years back that Shri Ram Sharma\n&gt; A=\r\ncharya was born as Thakur Ramkrishna in previous life.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another as intre=\r\nsting as well as equally confusing thing is that\n&gt; Late Shri Yogeshwarji (A=\r\n Gujarati yogi) had also revealtion about\n&gt; his past life and he also indir=\r\nectly indicated in his biography that\n&gt; he was Thakur Ramkrishna in the pre=\r\nvious birth.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yours,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt;\n&gt; I know\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yah=\r\noogroups. com, &quot;Shiv&quot; &lt;theblisswithin@ &gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Respected Ashwinj=\r\ni\n&gt; &gt; This is a very good and inspiring thread.\n&gt; &gt; I would like to mention=\r\n something that may be an interesting\n&gt; insight.\n&gt; &gt; You mentioned Pt Shrir=\r\nam Sharma Acharya.

There was a Telephone ex=\r\nchange just opposite to Post\n&gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep=C3=A2?Tt; I had=\r\n friendship with some\n&gt; Telephone\n&gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (=\r\nwe will call him as Mr.\nPatel)\n&gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunc=\r\nh devotee of=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 shri\n&gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was mee=\r\nting him he was always talking\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day b=\r\ny day. There was a weekly\n&gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He w=\r\nas singing devotional songs created\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; him and was weeping while sing=\r\ning. He was reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were =\r\nattending this weekly\n&gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 year=\r\ns old. Mr. Patel was of 30\n&gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seashore daily a=\r\nt 7 pm after duty\nhours\n&gt; &gt; and were talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One d=\r\nay when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--\n&gt; =C3=A2?oRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n some guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me.

I was very much impressed about\n&gt; h=\r\nim.\n&gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus,\n=\r\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet\n=\r\nI\n&gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was\n&gt; punctur=\r\ned\n&gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to=\r\n believe that he had some super\n&gt; power\n&gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishand=\r\nev worship only. I was attracted to\n&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I s=\r\nhould also be disciple of shri\n&gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974=\r\n. At 7 pm I surrendered\n&gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=C3=A2?Ts house =\r\nbefore Thakur picture.

As my duty w=\r\nas to start from 7 am I was\n&gt; waking\n&gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my w=\r\nife in the morning that I have\n&gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurude=\r\nv.

I=\r\n thought-- yes I have taken\n&gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of M=\r\nr.

I also deci=\r\nded\nto\n&gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oSee=\r\n, Mr. Patel\n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen him.

It IS p=\r\nossible.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Believe me, all it takes for Her is a split second to turn =\r\na fool into a &lt;BR&gt;self-realized person.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You will do yourself a big f=\r\navor if you take the thoughts of &quot;extraordinary &lt;BR&gt;experiences&quot; off your m=\r\nind. These expectations are a big obstacle.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you normally feel sad=\r\n or angry or upset when someone criticizes you badly &lt;BR&gt;and you are now ab=\r\nle to feel normal in that situation, isn&#39;t that a &lt;BR&gt;&quot;tangible&quot; sign of pr=\r\nogress? If you normally feel elated when someone &lt;BR&gt;praises you to the sky=\r\n and you are now\n able to feel normal in that &lt;BR&gt;situation, isn&#39;t that a &quot;=\r\ntangible&quot; sign of progress?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead of focusing your senses outward =\r\nand looking for some miracle or an &lt;BR&gt;&quot;extraordinaty experience&quot;, focus yo=\r\nur senses inward, watch your thoughts &lt;BR&gt;and instincts closely and refine =\r\nthem. Try to reach a state where criticism &lt;BR&gt;and praise are the same for =\r\nyou.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;That will put you in a good stead. THAT is real progress. If yo=\r\nu make real &lt;BR&gt;progress and do not bother about any &quot;extraordinary experie=\r\nnces&quot; , you may &lt;BR&gt;indeed have an extraordinary experience oneday! Not the=\r\n one that gets you &lt;BR&gt;stuck with a sense of possessiveness or entitlement,=\r\n but the one that frees &lt;BR&gt;you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If i think rationally and take=\r\n the experiences of others than it is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; quite clear that the spiritua=\r\nl growth invariably comes along with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; some out of the world and tang=\r\niable experiences. this some times&lt;BR&gt;&gt; temporarily disappoints me.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;One can\n get stuck in some expectations that are unknowingly formed in t=\r\nhe &lt;BR&gt;mind based on what one read or heard.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One can get stuck in po=\r\nssessiveness or a sense of entitlement over an &lt;BR&gt;&quot;extraordinary experienc=\r\ne&quot; that actually happened to him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One can get stuck in many ways.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you do not want to get stuck, have no expectations. Have no sense o=\r\nf &lt;BR&gt;ownership over anything. Surrender to Her fully, not because it will =\r\ngive X &lt;BR&gt;or Y or Z, but because everything is really Hers. Keep looking a=\r\nt yourself &lt;BR&gt;and your own actions/thoughts and refine them to make the se=\r\nnse of surrender &lt;BR&gt;fuller and fuller. And expect to get nothing from Her =\r\nin return for that &lt;BR&gt;surrender.

It is also possible that&lt;BR&gt;neither is&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Thakur.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bottomline is that it does not really matter!&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you are attracted to Thakur and his teachings, benefit from&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;them. Beings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like Thakur are born out of free volition and out o=\r\nf compassion for&lt;BR&gt;other&lt;BR&gt;&gt; beings. They are the playmates of the Mot=\r\nher and are reborn as a&lt;BR&gt;part of Her&lt;BR&gt;&gt; plan. They are born to show =\r\nthe path to others. However, there are&lt;BR&gt;many&lt;BR&gt;&gt; paths. In each life,=\r\n they may take up a different mission and&lt;BR&gt;demonstrate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; different =\r\npaths to people through their teachings and deeds. If you&lt;BR&gt;like the&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; teachings of such a being in a specific birth, due to\n some rina&lt;BR&gt;with=\r\n the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; path taught in that birth, follow the teachings of that birth.=\r\n Who&lt;BR&gt;else the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; same being was in other births is not that relevan=\r\nt or useful.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If you are attracted to the teachings of any s=\r\naint - Ramakrishna&lt;BR&gt;Paramahamsa&lt;BR&gt;&gt; or Shriram Sharma Acharya or Yoge=\r\nshwar ji or Ramana Maharshi or&lt;BR&gt;Aurobindo or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Srila Prabhupada or =\r\nAkkalkot Maharaj or Sai Baba or Kabir or&lt;BR&gt;Samartha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramadas or Jna=\r\nneshwar Maharaj or Chaitanya Mahaprabhu or&lt;BR&gt;Ramanujacharya or&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rag=\r\nhavedra Swami or Gautama Buddha or Jesus Christ or whoever,&lt;BR&gt;follow the&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; teachings of that saint and benefit from them. Other speculative&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nthings&lt;BR&gt;&gt; about them may be interesting, but can turn out to be a mere=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;distraction.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Find the teachings and path that attracts =\r\nyou the most. Read the&lt;BR&gt;teachings.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; More importantly, try to *walk=\r\n* the path. Imbibe the teachings\n in&lt;BR&gt;your&lt;BR&gt;&gt; thinking and in your c=\r\nommon sense. Your actions and thoughts should&lt;BR&gt;reflect&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the teachi=\r\nngs. Focus on the teachings of the saint, digest them&lt;BR&gt;fully and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nbase your thoughts and actions on them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Regarding Ramakrishna, I want to say one thing. The extent to which&lt;BR&gt;h=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt; imbibed the upanishadic philosophy in his thoughts and actions, t=\r\nhe&lt;BR&gt;depth of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; his sense of surrender to the Mother and the absolut=\r\ne lack of&lt;BR&gt;personal ego&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in him are the real miracles to me. Other=\r\n miracles are useful to&lt;BR&gt;instill&lt;BR&gt;&gt; faith and confidence in some peo=\r\nple. But they do not do justice to&lt;BR&gt;his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; personality. In fact, Swa=\r\nmi Vivekananda was very conscious of&lt;BR&gt;possibly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; limiting Thakur&#39;s =\r\npersonality to a bunch of miracles and was&lt;BR&gt;concerned if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; books on=\r\n him would be able to do justice to his personality.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If Ram=\r\nakrishna Paramahamsa\n tranformed a bunch of youngsters into&lt;BR&gt;spiritual&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; giants who affected the spirituality of generations and if Srila&lt;BR&gt;P=\r\nrabhupada&lt;BR&gt;&gt; transformed many fallen souls into excellent saints who c=\r\nhanged the&lt;BR&gt;world,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; it was possible because of their *total* surre=\r\nnder to the Lord and&lt;BR&gt;the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; zeroness of their personal ego. *That* =\r\nis a true miracle.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I do not want to downplay the discussion=\r\n of other tangible&lt;BR&gt;miracles. But I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; do not want people to lose tr=\r\nack of the crux of the matter.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna could do miracle=\r\ns because he had no ego and surrendered&lt;BR&gt;fully to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Her. *She* did =\r\neverything for him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; As I said earlier, a person with normal=\r\n ego can do some things; a&lt;BR&gt;person&lt;BR&gt;&gt; with very little personal ego =\r\ncan do tremendous things; and, a&lt;BR&gt;person with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; *no* personal ego c=\r\nan do *any* thing. Our goal should be to&lt;BR&gt;eradicate&lt;BR&gt;&gt; personal ego =\r\nthrough\n constant vigilance and total surrender.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regar=\r\nds,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://ww=\r\nw.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http=\r\n://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lesso=\r\nns (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagann=\r\nath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --=\r\n--- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ =\r\n...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; t=\r\narget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Sent: Sunday, November 09, 2008 3:07 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] R=\r\ne: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; one Gayatri Upaasaka told me many years back that Shri Ram S=\r\nharma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Acharya was born as Thakur Ramkrishna in previous life.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Another as intresting as well as equally confusing thing is that=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Late Shri Yogeshwarji (A Gujarati yogi) had also revealtion about&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; his past life and he also indirectly indicated in his biography tha=\r\nt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he was Thakur Ramkrishna\n in the previous birth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nYours,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I know&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Shiv&quot; &lt;theblisswithin=\r\n@ &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Respected Ashwinji&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; This is a very good and inspiring thread.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I would like to=\r\n mention something that may be an interesting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; insight.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n You mentioned Pt Shriram Sharma Acharya.

We 10 to 1=\r\n2 youngsters were attending this weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; meeting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on Sat=\r\nurday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; th=\r\nen. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty&lt;BR&gt;hours&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; and were talking only about Thakur.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One day when w=\r\ne were at sea shore he suddenly told me--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=A2?oRawalbhai,&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; son&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have =\r\nto go now=C3=A2?&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD. -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; And with my surpris=\r\ne his 8 years old son came to call him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; At one another in=\r\ncident he told me that there will be a plane&lt;BR&gt;&gt; crash&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; tom=\r\norrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; He could foresee the events.\n One day I had to go to Dwarka by=\r\n Bus,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire wi=\r\nll be punctured. Yet&lt;BR&gt;I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not =\r\ncome from Dwarka as was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; punctured&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on the way. This was=\r\n surprising.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that h=\r\ne had some super&lt;BR&gt;&gt; power&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishand=\r\nev worship only. I was attracted to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I tho=\r\nught, I should also be disciple of shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thakur and the day cam=\r\ne. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered&lt;BR&gt;&gt; myself&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to Th=\r\nakur at Mr. Patel=C3=A2?Ts house before Thakur picture. I prayed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; hi=\r\nm&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow=\r\n his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; grace.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion w=\r\nith my wife at 6.10 morning&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty w=\r\nas to start from 7 am I was&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n waking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning=\r\n. I told to my wife in the morning that I have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; accepted Shri R=\r\namkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; she&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; argued with me a lot. =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oWhy should you take such a hasty&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; decision?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kal=\r\ni at Calcutta. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; was a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru shoul=\r\nd be living one, who can guide us,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; give&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; us Mantra etc.=\r\n etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Acharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD--.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; H=\r\ner arguments were right at her place as people in general not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; know&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have t=\r\naken&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;telling&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; their disciples to test\n him before accepting him. =\r\nI also decided&lt;BR&gt;to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife t=\r\nhat =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oSee, Mr. Patel&lt;BR&gt;&gt; has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; never come to o=\r\nur home. You have also not seen him. He has never&lt;BR&gt;&gt; asked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house&lt;BR&gt;&gt; wi=\r\nthin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection for=\r\n Thakur&lt;BR&gt;is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; perfect?=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; She=\r\n laughed at me=C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oHow it is possible? I don=C3=A2?Tt believe.=\r\n=C3=A2?&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to s=\r\nend Mr. Patel immediately to justify my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; decision and convince =\r\nmy wife. =C3=A2?~I want to test your existence&lt;BR&gt;&gt; even&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to=\r\nday.=C3=A2?T&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my h=\r\nome at 06.30 in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; morning with angry mood. What he told?&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=A2?~ How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know\n wha=\r\nt&lt;BR&gt;happened?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come=\r\n to my home at&lt;BR&gt;05.30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; mornings today and tried to sleep for =\r\n1 or 2 hours. Suddenly&lt;BR&gt;Thakur&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; pulled my blanket and told me=\r\n that-=C3=A2?o Go to your friend=C3=A2?Ts&lt;BR&gt;&gt; house. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; is=\r\n waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; house=C3=\r\n=A2?=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur w=\r\nas guiding me the way&lt;BR&gt;&gt; to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; your house and pushing me too=\r\n. What you want? Why you are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; disturbing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; him in such an=\r\n early morning for such a silly things?=C3=A2?T&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; We both w=\r\nere so excited and surprised that we had no words that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Morning=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my=\r\n life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; There&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; were some more Devine experiences about S=\r\nhri Thakur but I will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; write&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it sometime.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Dear\n Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; earth.
