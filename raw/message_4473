S. RAMANAN&#39;S TALK At Arunachala Ashrama on April 13, 1997\n\nWHEN dea=\r\nr Dennis asked me the other day to talk on &quot;Sri Maharshi, My\nGrandfather,&quot; =\r\nI readily agreed. Yes, I do belong to His lineage, being the\neldest grandso=\r\nn of Swami Niranjanananda, His younger brother, whom I\nremember very well. =\r\nSwami Niranjanananda&#39;s Ekabhakti to Bhagavan never once\ndemonstrated his fa=\r\nmily link with Him. He always exhorted others to worship\nand cling to Bhaga=\r\nvan as the one and only Master.\n\nLadies and gentlemen, I feel proud to call=\r\n myself the grandson of Swami\nNiranjanananda because he was one of the grea=\r\ntest devotees of our Master. I\ndistinctly recollect what he once told a rel=\r\native who prostrated before him.\nThis relative, according to custom, was ta=\r\nking her child to Lord\nVenkateswara in Tirupati to have the baby&#39;s hair cut=\r\n for the first time. The\nSwami advised her that &quot;When Lord Venkateswara is =\r\nright HERE, why go to\nTirupati at all!.&quot; Such was his unshakeable faith in =\r\nBhagavan, his Guru.\n\nTo me, also, Bhagavan is not just the grandfather, but=\r\n the Guru. If He is my\ngrandfather, He is the grandfather for all of us her=\r\ne. To Bhagavatji, of\ncourse, He is the father!\n\nUntil I left for higher stu=\r\ndies at a university, I lived with my family in\nthe then sleepy town of Tir=\r\nuvannamalai. My first recollection of Bhagavan is\nwhen I was about seven. O=\r\nn all Sundays, school holidays and festivals our\nentire family was in the A=\r\nshram from early morning until about 6 p.m. At\nthat time the Vedic chanting=\r\n in front of Sri Bhagavan would be concluding\nwith the chanting of Bhagavan=\r\n&#39;s Upadesa Saram. In those days I never failed\nto rush to the Old Hall and =\r\nrecite Upadesa Saram along with the Veda\nPatasala boys. It is the only comp=\r\nosition of His I knew since my childhood.\n\nSri T. K. Sundaresa Iyer, my rev=\r\nered teacher, once dictated a story to me\nand I wrote it down. He showed it=\r\n to Bhagavan and told Him that it was my\nhandwriting. I was very happy to h=\r\near that Bhagavan said that my handwriting\nwas good. I may say here that it=\r\n is not bad even now!\n\nI also remember Bhagavan grinding chutney for the br=\r\neakfast in the long\nverandah east of the Ashram kitchen, and His offering a=\r\n small quantity of it\nwith His own hand to me to taste!I can&#39;t claim I was =\r\naware of His exalted\nstate in those early years of my youth, but I was cert=\r\nainly aware that He\nwas always natural, and most of the first-time visitors=\r\n also felt that they\nsomehow had always known Him. As Major Chadwick observ=\r\ned, &quot;He was like a\nmirror which seemed to reflect back your own feelings.&quot; =\r\nIf you responded\nquite naturally to the all-embracing love of His presence,=\r\n he treated you as\none of His own.\n\nOnce a pair of pigeons were brought to =\r\nthe Ashram as an offering. Although\nBhagavan was at first reluctant to add =\r\nto the Ashram duties the care of the\npigeons, He accepted them. He took the=\r\nm in His hands, patted them\naffectionately and then became silent, absorbed=\r\n in samadhi. In the meantime\nit took the attendants nearly an hour to find =\r\na cage for the pigeons and\nbring it to the hall. All that time the pigeons =\r\nquietly sat on the\nMaharshi&#39;s lap without moving, as if they were themselve=\r\ns a pair of yogis\nsimilarly absorbed in samadhi. Bhagavan said, &quot;They came.=\r\n They refuse to go\nback. Another family has joined me - as if I have not en=\r\nough family\nalready.&quot;\n\nSimilar is the story of my own family. In 1938, when=\r\n some devotees proposed\nto Bhagavan that Venkatoo (my father) and his famil=\r\ny could come to\nTiruvannamalai and work in the Ashram office, Bhagavan agre=\r\ned. Then from the\nyear 1938 onwards, our family has been under the care of =\r\nthe Ashram.\n\nWe all know He gave moksha to His mother while in Skandashram.=\r\n My daily\nprayer to Him ever since I came permanently to the Ashram in 1992=\r\n, is:\n&quot;Bhagavan, make me serve your devotees as the first servant of the As=\r\nhram\nand when my end comes, liberate me as You liberated Your mother.&quot;\n\nI h=\r\nave often wondered about the great event which formed a turning point in\nBh=\r\nagavan&#39;s life, the dramatisation of the act of death he conducted about\nsix=\r\n weeks before he left Madurai for good.Was it this dramatisation alone\nthat=\r\n transformed the school boy into a sage? Was he not purna (complete)\neven f=\r\nrom the instant of His birth on December 30th, 1879? Did not the blind\nlady=\r\n who delivered Him see a bright light as he was born? Was there not a\nlink =\r\nbetween this light and the meteor that cut a golden path across the sky\nand=\r\n faded over Arunachala at the moment of His passing? Did He not at the\nage =\r\nof ten contemplate on death when His father died? Was it not a fact that\nin=\r\n His youth nobody could wake Him up from sleep, even by severely beating\nHi=\r\nm? I sincerely feel that out of compassion for us, and so we may not\nswerve=\r\n from His teachings, he chose to hide the Supreme State He was\nexperiencing=\r\n from the very day of His birth. His decision to wear only a\nkaupina (loin =\r\ncloth) after throwing away all his possessions on September\n1st, 1896 was n=\r\not for His own edification. It was for us He did this. He\nHimself later obs=\r\nerved &quot;Some power acts through the body of a Jivanmukta and\nuses his body t=\r\no get the work done.&quot;\n\nWhen Paramahansa Yogananda asked Bhagavan why God pe=\r\nrmitted suffering in the\nworld. Bhagavan replied, &quot;Suffering was the way fo=\r\nr realization of God.&quot; And\nwhen further questioned why should there be suff=\r\nering, His characteristic\nreply was &quot;Who suffers? What is suffering?&quot; Bhaga=\r\nvan always takes us back to\nthe single question &quot;Who am I?&quot; - to cultivate =\r\nSelf-knowledge at all\ntimes. Self-knowledge\nserves the practical purpose of=\r\n destroying pain and suffering caused by\nignorance.\n\nThere is a poem compos=\r\ned by Bhagavan entitled Atma Vidya which begins: &quot;Lo,\nvery easy is Self-kno=\r\nwledge, Lo very easy indeed - even for the most\ninfirm...&quot; After hearing th=\r\nis poem, Prof. G. V Subbaramayya asked Bhagavan\nwhy he was not getting it i=\r\nf it was that easy. Also, Sri Balarama Reddy\nendorsed G. V. S.&#39;s doubt by q=\r\nuoting a verse from the Bhagavad Gita.\nBhagavan looked at them with compass=\r\nion and confirmed &quot;What is written in\nAtma Vidya is true. Why do you doubt =\r\nit? So real is the Self that compared\nwith it even the gooseberry in the pa=\r\nlm of one&#39;s hand appears a mere\nillusion.&quot; This categorical assertion is no=\r\nt only meant for those two great\ndevotees, but for all of us who have been =\r\nattracted to Him and have\nexperienced His Grace. Yes, He continues to live =\r\nin our midst as Awareness,\nas the Person in all persons; He lives in all an=\r\nd as all life!\n\nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya!\n\nSource: http://www.arunach=\r\nala.org/newsletters/1997/?pg=3Dmay-jun\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd75c8c668574048920b791\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;SRI V.
