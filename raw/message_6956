On the other hand, if the same person goes to the gym\n*and* changes their eating habits, they are likely to make tremendous\nprogress.\n\nThe point is that we have 24 hours in a day, and all 24 hours count as\nsadhana. If you spend an hour doing severe sadhana, and then spend 23 hours\nactively undoing it, it is not the sadhana&#39;s fault. By all means, develop\nthe internal agni that helps you burn whatever you throw at it ... but,\nreducing the crap that you throw at it is also useful ... and, probably\nnecessary at the beginning. We need to get to a point where, instead of\neating all the junk food of the world around us, we avert our gaze, or we\nmerely glance at it without eating it.\n\nI am not making any statements on what homam can and cannot do. All I&#39;m\nsaying is, if you want to control your anger, well ... maybe you should\n*also* actively work on it. There is a split-second before things like anger\novercome us. We are so used to certain patterns of action, that we simply\nperform the action without thinking. Sadhana like homam really help you by\ngiving you that split-second pause. But, at the end of the day, it is still\nyour choice. You can still choose to lose control, and get angry with a full\nsense of doership.\n\nAnyway, these are just some thoughts from another seeker. Group discussion\nis good ... as all of us have a lot to learn from each other. Nature has\nbrought all of us together, through this group, for some reason. Truly, I am\nnot learned. I have met some learned people, and they are in a different\nleague.\n\nsasneham,\n\n     ajit\n\n\nOn Sat, Jul 23, 2011 at 8:06 AM, Jyotisa Shisya &lt;achyutagaddi@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaskarams Sri Ajit,\n&gt;\n&gt; Although I hate to differ with such a learned person as you, I do wonder\n&gt; what is your view on what homam can do and what it cannot do?\n&gt;\n&gt; best regards\n&gt; Hari\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Jul 23, 2011 at 12:41 AM, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; **\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Nagraj,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But I am not able to control my anger at all!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; IMO, homam does not *directly* help you control your vices.
