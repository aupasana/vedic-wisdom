Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Nama=\r\nste,\n&gt; \n&gt; In vedantic terms, ego stands for &quot;I-ness&quot; (sense of &quot;I&quot;). If you=\r\n \n&gt; self-identify with anything, you have an ego. Ego is not there when \nan=\r\nd only \n&gt; when there is no self-identification of any kind, i.e. when one i=\r\ns \nimmersed \n&gt; in Brahman without any distinction like &quot;this is I, this is =\r\nother&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, in order to exist in a body and function in this world, o=\r\nne \nneeds to \n&gt; keep alive atleast a very limited amount of self-identifica=\r\ntion.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, in most people, this self-identification is not &quot;a very=\r\n \nlimited&quot; \n&gt; amount, but really huge. We self-identify with a body, name a=\r\nnd \nidentity \n&gt; quite heavily. The goal is to reduce it and keep it under c=\r\nheck, so \nthat it \n&gt; is ready to completely melt away oneday.\n&gt; \n&gt; *       =\r\n *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; The only useful purpose of allowing ego (self-identificati=\r\non) to \nexist is to \n&gt; allow one to identify with a body, name etc and use =\r\nthem to do \ngod&#39;s work. \n&gt; How does one know what god&#39;s work one is suppose=\r\nd to do? One knows \nit \n&gt; through one&#39;s intuition, one&#39;s logical thinkiing =\r\nand external input \nlike the \n&gt; words of a guru or other learned men.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nHow you decide your dharma - what you are supposed to do in this \nworld - i=\r\ns \n&gt; personal and upto you. But, once you decide that, all your actions \nsh=\r\nould be \n&gt; centered around that. The level of self-identification should be=\r\n \nbarely \n&gt; sufficient for discharging one&#39;s dharma. Any self-identificatio=\r\nn \nabove that \n&gt; level is unneeded and counter-productive. It gets one enta=\r\nngled in \n&gt; unnecessary web of karmas.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppos=\r\ne I decide that my dharma is to spead homam in the world. \nThen I \n&gt; should=\r\n use my body, my name, my image, my thoughts and my actions \nto do what \n&gt; =\r\nis needed for spreading homam in the world. Suppose somebody \ndismisses hom=\r\nam \n&gt; and speaks very deridingly about homam and me. I may argue or \nignore=\r\n. If my \n&gt; judgment is that arguing with him and removing the doubts of peo=\r\nple \nis \n&gt; better to advance my dharma and spread homam, I should argue. If=\r\n my \njudgment \n&gt; is that ignoring is better to advance my dharma, I should =\r\nignore \nhim. If my \n&gt; self-identification with the name and its fame is too=\r\n strong and it \nwas \n&gt; offended by his deriding comments on me and I get ba=\r\nck to him just \nfor that \n&gt; reason, I am doing something silly and unneeded=\r\n. Instead, I should \nlook at \n&gt; what actions will help me advance my dharma=\r\n better.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; When Swami Vivekananda lived in US f=\r\nor sometime after his \ncelebrated speech \n&gt; at the parliament of religions =\r\nin Chicago, he received some good \ncoverage in \n&gt; US newspapers. Some jealo=\r\nus Indian neo-religious leaders conducted \na \n&gt; campaign of writing letters=\r\n to the parliament of religions \ndeclaring that \n&gt; Swami Vivekananda was a =\r\nfake and that he did not represent Hinduism.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swamiji was a detached so=\r\nul who did not care what people thought of \nhim. His \n&gt; self-identification=\r\n with the body, name and image in the world were \nthere \n&gt; only to finish h=\r\nis mission of spreading sanatana dharma and vedanta \nin the \n&gt; world. After=\r\n all, once he finished *his* dharma, he did not look \nback and \n&gt; gave up b=\r\nody.\n&gt; \n&gt; Still, he did not ignore the taunts and negative letter campaign.=\r\n \nHe took it \n&gt; seriously. If his detractors were taken seriously, it could=\r\n have \nderailed \n&gt; his mission. He needed thousands of important people fro=\r\nm across \nthe world \n&gt; to be influenced by him and start vedanta societies =\r\nin various \ncities (and \n&gt; co-operation from parliament of religions and po=\r\nsitive media \ncoverage \n&gt; contributed to it). That was *his* dharma as judg=\r\ned by him. So he \nused his \n&gt; body, name and image to engage in actions tha=\r\nt fought with his \ndetractors, \n&gt; shut them down and advanced his dharma. H=\r\ne requested Ramakrishna&#39;s \nother \n&gt; disciples in Calcutta to hold a public =\r\nmeeting and send news clips. \nSwami \n&gt; Abhedananda went from Dakshineshwar =\r\nto Calcutta, stayed there for a \nfew \n&gt; days, invited all spiritual leaders=\r\n, royals and famous \npersonalities to a \n&gt; public meeting, held a public me=\r\neting. He ensured that the grand \npublic \n&gt; meeting was attended by many fa=\r\nmous people and passed a formal \nresolution \n&gt; acknowledging Swami Vivekana=\r\nnda&#39;s contributions to Hinduism. News \nclips from \n&gt; Indian news papers wer=\r\ne promptly mailed to the parliament of \nreligions \n&gt; leaders. All doubts ab=\r\nout Vivekananda&#39;s authenticity were laid to \nrest.\n&gt; \n&gt; If Vivekananda did =\r\nthis out of personal egotism and to feel good \nabout \n&gt; himself, he would b=\r\ne binding himself in more entanglements. But, he \nwas \n&gt; doing it to advanc=\r\ne his chosen dharma, which was far bigger than \nfeeling \n&gt; good about himse=\r\nlf. So it did not really bind him.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; As you sai=\r\nd, suppose your superior insults you or is unfair to you. \nThe \n&gt; first ins=\r\ntinct of a person would be to be hurt or sad or angry or \nmad. But, \n&gt; that=\r\n is the sign of a overly strong self-identification with a \nbody, name \n&gt; a=\r\nnd image. What&#39;s the big deal if someone calls me names? You, the \n&gt; imperi=\r\nshable one, are trapped in this perishable identity (body, \nname, \n&gt; image)=\r\n *temporarily* just to fulfil some dharma. Identifying with \nthis \n&gt; identi=\r\nty just enough to fulfil your dharma is required. But why \nidentify \n&gt; more=\r\n than needed and become angry or sad or mad that someone thinks \nbadly \n&gt; a=\r\nbout this temporary identity? It is actually quite foolish.\n&gt; \n&gt; You should=\r\n think only in terms of your dharma. What is the dharma \nyou are \n&gt; working=\r\n for? What things help it and what things pull it back?\n&gt; \n&gt; Suppose you de=\r\ncide that one of your dharmas is to take care of your \nfamily \n&gt; (because t=\r\nhere are still unpaid karmik debts). Suppose an unfair \ncomment of \n&gt; a sup=\r\nerior has a chance of impacting your next performance review, \nyour \n&gt; sala=\r\nry or even your job itself, and, as a result, a chance of \nblocking your \n&gt;=\r\n dharma. Then, the question is what action will advance your dharma \nbetter=\r\n. \n&gt; Will you serve your dharma better by ignoring and remaining calm or \nb=\r\ny \n&gt; arguing back? Do whatever helps your chosen dharma more.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, thi=\r\nnking &quot;he is wrong. He is unfair to *me*&quot; and reacting \nbased on it \n&gt; usel=\r\ness, though that is what most people do. As I said above, do \nnot pay too \n=\r\n&gt; much attention to a temporary entity called your identity (body, \nname an=\r\nd \n&gt; image). You are not that. You are something else using &#39;that&#39; to \nfulf=\r\nil some \n&gt; dharma. Decide what your dharma is and base your actions in tric=\r\nky \n&gt; situations on their impact on your dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hope that clarifies a=\r\n little bit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; F=\r\nree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagann=\r\nath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Messag=\r\ne ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, January 19, 2009 11:52 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Difference between Self Respect & Ego?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rao Garu !\n&gt; &gt; Namaste =\r\n!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Few days back a person asked me sincerely one question.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What=\r\n is a difference between Self respect & Egoistic attitude in \nday\n&gt; &gt; to da=\r\ny life?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I thought it to be a very pertinent and complex question. =\r\nthat \nmay be\n&gt; &gt; the concern of many aspirants. only a advanced soul can tr=\r\ny to \nanswer\n&gt; &gt; this with some conviction.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I could have given her =\r\na detailed theoritical explanation but \nthats\n&gt; &gt; of no use unless things a=\r\nre clear.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Say for example, somebody Insults/Ignores/Neglects one pe=\r\nrson.
