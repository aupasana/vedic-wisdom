However, I could not easily reconcile myself to the idea of\ngivi=\r\nng up my personal service to Bhagavan. I had been debating the matter\nfor s=\r\nome days when the answer came in a strange way. As I entered the hall\none d=\r\nay I heard Bhagavan explaining to others who were there that real\nservice t=\r\no him did not mean attending to his physical needs but following\nthe essenc=\r\ne of his teaching: that is concentrating on realizing the\nSelf. Needless\nto=\r\n say, that automatically cleared my doubts.\n\nI therefore gave up my Ashram =\r\nduties, but I then found it hard to decide how\nin fact I should spend the e=\r\nntire day in search of Realization. I referred\nthe matter to Bhagavan and h=\r\ne advised me to make Self-enquiry my final aim,\nbut to practice Self-enquir=\r\ny, meditation, japa and recitation of scripture\nturn by turn, changing over=\r\n from one to another as and when I found the one\nI was doing irksome or dif=\r\nficult. In course of time, he said, the sadhana\nwould become stabilised in =\r\nSelf-enquiry or pure Consciousness or\nRealization.\n\nFrom my personal experi=\r\nence, as well as from that of others within my\nknowledge, I can say that be=\r\nfore recommending any path to an aspirant\nBhagavan would first find out fro=\r\nm him what aspect, or form, or path he was\nnaturally drawn to and then reco=\r\nmmend him to follow it. He would sometimes\nendorse the traditional stages o=\r\nf sadhana, advancing from worship (puja) to\nincantation (japa), then to med=\r\nitation (dhyana), and finally to Self-enquiry\n(vichara). However, he also u=\r\nsed to say that continuous and rigorous\npractice of any one of these method=\r\ns was adequate in itself to lead to\nRealization.\n\nThus, for instance, when =\r\none adopts the method of worship, say of the\nShakti, one should, by constan=\r\nt practice and concentration, be able to see\nthe Shakti everywhere and alwa=\r\nys and in everything and thus give up\nidentification with the ego. Similarl=\r\ny with japa. By constant and continuous\nrepetition of a mantra one gets mer=\r\nged in it and loses all sense of separate\nindividuality. In dhyana again, i=\r\nn constant meditation, with bhavana or deep\nfeeling, one attains the state =\r\nof Bhavanatheeta, which is only another name\nfor pure Consciousness. Thus, =\r\nany method, if taken earnestly and practiced\nunremittingly, will result in =\r\nelimination of the &quot;I&quot; and lead to the goal of\nRealization.\n\nOnce some awkw=\r\nard problems concerning Ashram management cropped up. Without\nbeing directl=\r\ny concerned, I was worried about them, as I felt that failure\nto solve them=\r\n satisfactorily would impair the good name of the Ashram. One\nday two or th=\r\nree devotees went to Bhagavan and put the problems before him.\nI happened t=\r\no enter the hall while they were talking about them, and he\nimmediately tur=\r\nned to me and asked me why I had come in at this time and why\nI was interes=\r\nting myself in such matters. I did not grasp the meaning of his\nquestion, s=\r\no Bhagavan explained that a person should occupy himself only\nwith that pur=\r\npose with which he had originally come to the Ashram and asked\nme what my o=\r\nriginal purpose had been. I replied: &quot;To receive Bhagavan&#39;s\nGrace.&quot; So he s=\r\naid: &quot;Then occupy yourself with that only.&quot;\n\nHe further continued by asking=\r\n me whether I had any interest in matters\nconcerning the Ashram management =\r\nwhen I first came here. On my replying that\nI had not, he added: &quot;Then conc=\r\nentrate on the original purpose of your\ncoming here.&quot;\n\n- From the Mountain =\r\nPath, July 1966\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/1998/?pg=3Dm=\r\nay-jun\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=\r\n=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd64978894cba048893b0a8\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nAFTER SPENDING about twelve years in personal attendance on Bhag=\r\navan, I began to feel an urge to devote myself entirely to sadhana, spendin=\r\ng my time all alone.
