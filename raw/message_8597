Prove it.\n\nTeacher : Th=\r\nink twice.\n\nStudent : I have thought 4 times.\n\nTeacher : Ho ho ho, what a f=\r\nun day I will have.\n\nStudent : Yeah, right. *rolls eyes like a supermodel s=\r\naying whatever*\n\nTeacher : Have you ever seen a battery powered toy? Especi=\r\nally the one\nwhich is modeled in the form of a bear, and claps its hands as=\r\n soon as\nit is powered on. Its hands hold two plates which strike each othe=\r\nr ,\nthe bear&#39;s eyes light up as soon as the battery is put in, and boom, we=\r\n\nare ready to go.\n\nStudent : Yes, yes, I have seen those. There are other t=\r\nypes also, like\nwhen you put batteries in a car model, it suddenly starts o=\r\nperating, and\ngoing bonkers, or the teddy bear one, which starts repeating =\r\nsome cuddly\nlines. It is loved by girls.\n\nTeacher : Yes, exactly. You, righ=\r\nt now, are the teddy bear, which girls\nand everybody loves.\n\nStudent : =85=\r\n=85=85=85. the fuck?\n\nTeacher : aww!! How cute , my little child is thinkin=\r\ng in terms of\nprofanities. Do you know why you are here?\n\nStudent : *thinks=\r\n in mind about all the philosophical stuff he has read,\nand knew this quest=\r\nion was widely discussed and asked, and thus becomes\nhappy&quot;=85. why?\n\nTeach=\r\ner : Because , somebody fucked somebody, LOL. But anyways, leave\nthis fucki=\r\nng business aside for a moment. Lets go back to the\ndiscussion, the end of =\r\nwhich will be very fun.\n\nStudent: we were on the topic that I am a teddy be=\r\nar.\n\nTeacher : Don&#39;t twist my words, I said right now you are akin to a ted=\r\ndy\nbear. You have been that car, the helicopter , the teddy, the bear who\nc=\r\nlaps, basically all the battery powered toys earlier. In philosophical\nterm=\r\ns they are called &quot;births&quot;.\n\nStudent : How may I ask?\n\nTeacher : What is yo=\r\nur name?\n\nStudent : Chaman Sharma ( name changed due to security & other hu=\r\nmorous\nreasons)\n\nTeacher : LOL @ name. Anyways, think of chaman sharma\nas t=\r\nhe bear (the battery powered toy) who claps and claps and claps,\nthat &quot;I am=\r\n Chaman Sharma, I am a male, I own a house, I am 20 years old\n, i like this=\r\n girl, I love playing sports, I live here, I read this, I\nhate that, I this=\r\n, and I that&quot;, okay?\n\nStudent : Go on.. * feeling a bit ridiculous about hi=\r\nmself*\n\nTeacher : So when Chaman dies, which is going to happen sooner than=\r\n\nlater, do you know what happens or what that means?\n\nStudent : I die, but =\r\nin reality &quot;I&quot; don&#39;t die.\n\nTeacher : Very good, you have read that off of a=\r\n book, ever realized it?\nAre you not afraid of death?\n\nStudent : No, I am n=\r\not afraid of death.\n\nThe lights turn off in the room, there is total darkne=\r\nss, for 5 minutes\nthere is no noise, but Chaman gets terrified, and then a =\r\npair of deep\nred eyes appear in the dark, and in the most ghastly voice eve=\r\nr asks Mr\nChaman, &quot;why are you so afraid? the basis of all fear is death, a=\r\nnd only\nthe lights have gone out, I haven&#39;t even started with you yet, if y=\r\nou\nsay you are not going to die, then why so scared?&quot;\n\nSuddenly the lights =\r\nturn back on, the teacher is laughing his ass off,\nwith Chaman shivering.\n\n=\r\nTeacher : You said you were not afraid.\n\nStudent : I never meant it, like t=\r\nhat.\n\nTeacher : Then in what way did you mean it? Take it as a lesson that\n=\r\npractical stuff in this spirituality business is far greater than all\nyour =\r\nbooks combined. You get lost while reading, you think you are\ndifferent. To=\r\n me you are no worse than the thousand others I meet,\nin-fact they are bett=\r\ner off without the texts you have studied.\n\nStudent : Agreed, but don&#39;t sca=\r\nre me like that. Again.\n\nTeacher : I will, if you make such ridiculous clai=\r\nms again. Anyways,\nwhere were we? The death of the teddy bear. Yes. But min=\r\nd you the teddy\nremains, the outer shell remains, but teddy is dead. The ou=\r\nter shell is\neither buried or burnt, in essence done away with, because it =\r\nis of no\nuse. Right?\n\nStudent : Right\n\nTeacher : Wrong. Lets get back to th=\r\ne toy. Consider this, when you\nremove the battery from the toy, what happen=\r\ns? The toy is literally\nuseless, it can&#39;t clap, it can&#39;t shout, it can&#39;t cr=\r\ny, it can&#39;t do shit.\nThus, at death, Mr Chaman, you are removed from Mr Cha=\r\nman&#39;s body. You\nnever die, you are only the battery powering this personali=\r\nty which\nleads to powering your body.\n\nStudent: How can you even=85=85\n\nTea=\r\ncher : Lets consider that you are two batteries, two aa sized ones.\nWhen yo=\r\nu plug the batteries into a car, suddenly the car comes to life,\nwithout th=\r\ne battery the car is idle, but as soon as I put the battery\nin, the car goe=\r\ns=85=85.. beep beep honk honk, move, I am a car.\n\nStudent : sits in silence=\r\n knowing well that interrupting now will be the\nbiggest mistake ever.\n\nTeac=\r\nher :And when I take the same batteries out of a car and put it into\nlets s=\r\nay a teddy bear, the teddy bear comes alive, start to sing a song,\nor acts =\r\nmushy. And when I pull the battery out?\n\nStudent : Teddy is idle, literally=\r\n useless.\n\nTeacher : Yes, but go deeper. It was the same battery that power=\r\ned the\ncar, it was the same battery that powered the teddy bear, and it is =\r\nthe\nsame battery that can power any toy, correct?\n\nStudent : Correct\n\nTeach=\r\ner : While the battery is in the car, it believes itself to be the\ncar. It =\r\nbelieves &quot;yesssss, i am a car, red colour, 198 bhp, 70 mm\ntorque, top speed=\r\n 320kmph, 4 wheels, engine at the back, hot woman in my\npassengers seat, I =\r\nam the king baby, look at how hot I am&quot;\n\nStudent: Oh dear god=85.\n\nTeacher =\r\n: Then I take out the battery from the car. And PHAT it is a\nuseless piece =\r\nof metal. And I plug the battery into a teddy, suddenly it\nbelieves itself =\r\nto be the teddy, it goes &quot; yeeeeessssss, I am the teddy,\nI am mushy, I am s=\r\noft, everybody adores me, look how cuddly I am, I can\neven clap my hands &quot;,=\r\n and when I take the battery out, PHAT, the teddy\nis=85..\n\nStudent : Useles=\r\ns, and dead.\n\nTeacher : Thats a useless conclusion, it is known by the worl=\r\nd, not\nrealized. Every tom dick and harry knows that, Lets go deeper. The p=\r\noint\nis the battery confuses itself to be the teddy or the god damn car.\n\nS=\r\ntudent : So the battery is the soul?\n\nTeacher : *smacks on the student&#39;s he=\r\nad* Who said that?\n\nStudent : You did.\n\nTeacher : *another phatek on the he=\r\nad of the student* When did I say?\nYou read it in one of your fancy article=\r\ns and commentaries and satsangs\nthat people do, genius, and you read it all=\r\n too wrong, you read it and\nthus think you &#39;know&#39;, you never practiced, foo=\r\nls you people are. Most\nof the time you people are fed bullshit and you gob=\r\nble it up like pigs\nin mud. That reminds me we haven&#39;t had a pepperoni  piz=\r\nza in a long\ntime, lets order one. LOL\n\nStudent : Sorry=85\n\nTeacher : Don&#39;t=\r\n be, you are my child, I love you. Anyways , back to our\ndiscussion on toys=\r\n. The confusion of the battery. And thus Chaman, you\nconfuse yourself to be=\r\n Chaman. This is the 67432th time , you have been\nplugged into a a toy (rea=\r\nd body) and the confusion prevails. Focus on\nthe &quot;confusion&quot; aspect.\n\nStude=\r\nnt : Then who am I?\n\nTeacher : You are the ever lasting consciousness, the =\r\nuniversal bliss,\nthe infinite, the ever pervading light of the universe!!! =\r\nBreathe in and\nout and feel the bliss!!\n\nStudent : Yess!!! this is what I r=\r\nead, * breathes in and out deeply*\n*Smells huge amounts of odor*=85=85 What=\r\n is that smell?\n\nTeacher : I just farted, feels so blissful, did you feel y=\r\nour bliss too?\n\nStudent : Ewwwww=85.\n\nTeacher : Bhutni ke, do you think we =\r\nguys are fools who have spent lives\nin search of who we are, and you will k=\r\nnow just by breathing in and out,\nand thinking you are the ever lasting con=\r\nsciousness and all that???\nBefkuf!! Chaman kahin ka!!\n\nStudent : But you on=\r\nly said that  &quot;You are the ever lasting\nconsciousness, the universal bliss,=\r\n the infinite, the ever pervading\nlight of the universe!!! Breathe in and o=\r\nut and feel the bliss!!&quot;\n\nTeacher : It is called a test, and needless to sa=\r\ny you have scored a\ncompartment.\n\nStudent : Hey ram=85=85=85.\n\nTeacher : So=\r\n back to who you are, you are just like the battery who is\nthe source of th=\r\nat body and the personality and confuses itself to be &quot;\nI am Chaman Sharma,=\r\n age 20, resident of vasant vihar, have a girlfriend,\nam a male, love to pa=\r\nrty, own a mercedez, worship a a little, interested\nin god and whatever &quot;\n\n=\r\nStudent : So who am I?\n\nTeacher : You are duracell=85..How do they write po=\r\nst a mathematics\nsolution=85=85=85Q.E.D or hence proved. QED =3D  quite eas=\r\nily done.\n\nStudent : Thats one more self identification of being duracell\n\n=\r\nTeacher : Brilliant!!!!!! Now you are talking.\n\nStudent: *Feels quite proud=\r\n*\n\nTeacher : And THAT is one more self identification.\n\nStudent : Hey Ram!!=\r\n\n\nTeacher : Ram Ram.\n\nStudent : So I theoretically understand it , but how =\r\ndo I actually\nrealize it?\n\nTeacher : You do Sadhana.\n\nStudent : Sitting in =\r\na yogic pose and focusing on the lotus and all?\n\nTeacher : I will fucking b=\r\neat you to your death if you repeat this\nbullshit ever again.\n\nStudent: Sor=\r\nry=85\n\nTeacher : No need to be. That is what is meant by Sadhana to most\npe=\r\nople. But does anyone know what is Sadhana?\n\nStudent : You shed some light =\r\non it?\n\nTeacher: What do you think I am a bulb? LOL, Anyways, all sadhana i=\r\ns\nbasically in essence, and mark these all important words.\n&quot; YOU trying to=\r\n convince yourself that &quot;you&quot; are not YOU &quot;\n\nBirths are spent on this my bo=\r\ny, births not lives, it takes a lot of\neffort to tell and convince yourself=\r\n that you are just not you.\n\nStudent : and how do you do that?\n\nTeacher : B=\r\ny sadhana aka mostly known as repeating a mantra. You\neventually yourself b=\r\necome the form of the mantra that you chant, thus\nrealizing the deity( the =\r\nbig daddy battery)/ the specific form of the\none (the source of all the Big=\r\n and small batteries). A mantra means man\nki tarana, does it not?\n\nStudent =\r\n: So by sadhana , I will realize that I am the battery and not\nthis persona=\r\nlity?\n\nTeacher : Yes, but the day &quot;you&quot; realize, &quot;you&quot; will go dead, to\nyou=\r\nrself.\n\nStudent: I am beginning to understand a little, can you explain whe=\r\nre\ndoes a deity stand in this whole battery concept?\n\nTeacher : If you are =\r\nthe battery, the battery has to have a source, you\nare not svayambhu that y=\r\nou exist on you own. The deity is like a huge\npower station in your compari=\r\nson. It is almost infinite, but since it is\na power station it is bound to =\r\nhave a boundary somewhere, but to you, aa\nsized battery it is endless. Cham=\r\nan&#39;s source is his parents, but\nchaman&#39;s actual source&#39;s (battery) parent i=\r\ns the power station.\n\nStudent : Hmmm=85.. that&#39;s why she is worshipped as m=\r\na?\n\nTeacher : Yes. Who is a Siddha?? A guy or a girl who has realized that\n=\r\nhe/she himself is the battery and then went on to become one with a\npower s=\r\ntation and thus sees himself/herself in everything because the\npower statio=\r\nn is the source of everything , of all batteries. And since\nhe/she actually=\r\n knows that all elements too are currents and everything\nelse too, he/she a=\r\nctually sees it as that. And thus, the &quot;miracles&quot;. Let\nsay I fully well don=\r\n&#39;t see a difference between me and this table, thus\nI am this table, thus I=\r\nf i wish to make it fly, I can do it, because I\nam actually it. To you it i=\r\ns a table, to me it is just a current, who is\njust &quot;me&quot;.\n\nStudent: Oooohhhh=\r\nhhhh=85=85.\n\nTeacher : He maybe sai baba to you, but thats how your eyes pe=\r\nrceive him\nto be as, an old man with frail clothing, belongs to shirdi etc =\r\netc, but\ninside he is far beyond what you or I can comprehend. He first rea=\r\nlized\nhe was a battery by doing penance, thus killing himself in the proces=\r\ns,\nthe he realized that the battery is as good as the power station because=\r\n\nthe current is the same, so he became one with that, and then he went\nbeyo=\r\nnd and came back to guide as he was chosen, just like many others\nare, like=\r\n my great teacher, guru nanak dev, Ramakrishna and all\nothers=85=85=85\n\nStu=\r\ndent : And the source of the power station is?\n\nTeacher : The one- Satya sh=\r\nri akaal , he/she/it can&#39;t be put into words\nbecause he is infinite and the=\r\n words are finite. It is purely on\ndefining him religious wars, riots betwe=\r\nen religions , and intellectual\ndiscussions and debates on this thing calle=\r\nd internet happen, but\nhe/she/it is far beyond comprehension. Many people f=\r\nocus on that , and\nget lost, but focus on the power station (deity) and it =\r\nwill take you to\nbig daddy.\nImagine an endless field of current in comparis=\r\non of the power station ,\nan endless current which exists and all others ar=\r\ne a figment of it. The\npower stations are a part of it, the current has tak=\r\nen the form of one\nconcentrated zone.. But even this contains error of spee=\r\nch, so chuck it.\nThe ultimate is only realized when you are one with the po=\r\nwer station so\nlets focus there.\n\nStudent : So the one has taken forms of d=\r\nifferent power stations to help\nthe batteries who are spread out to help un=\r\nite back with it?\n\nTeacher : Brilliant.\n\nStudent: So all our lives we debat=\r\ne/fight and cut each other off to\nclaim which power station (deity) is more=\r\n powerful over the other and\nsuperior to all others, when in truth our eyes=\r\n perceive them(deities) to\nbe different, when they are in essence one(Satya=\r\n shri akaal) and\nlaughing back at us?\n\nTeacher : ho ho ho=85.. Go on.\n\nStud=\r\nent : And we try to worship 10 different ones and always think that\nwe shou=\r\nld worship as many to get maximum benefit for our mistakingly\nconfused iden=\r\ntities of teddy , the car and all other toys?\n\nTeacher : *smokes slowly*=85=\r\n I am listening.\n\nStudent: So the biggest fools are those who are lost in d=\r\nebates and\npseudo breathing in and out and raising kundalinis with peacock =\r\nfeathers\nand punches to the spine, reading stuff and debating on concepts w=\r\nhich\nthey don&#39;t know a thing about?\n\nTeacher: Yes,Speaking of Kundalini, sh=\r\ne is basically you, she is the\nbattery. the stupidest thing in the world is=\r\n this concept of &quot;my\nkundalini&quot;, err=85. you are her you idiot, how is she =\r\nyours? Anyways ,\nmany make this error, but it is essential because other wi=\r\nse you can&#39;t\nexplain the concept in speech. And if you do fully realize you=\r\n are her,\n&quot;you&quot; will be phat dead in one second. Whenever you are worshippi=\r\nng lets\nsay a form, you in essence , are worshipping yourself, in your full=\r\n\nglory . Whatever you are worshipping is &quot;you&quot;, who is without all the\nlimi=\r\ntations of Chaman/teddy/car/toy.\n\nStudent: So then how do realized souls st=\r\nay in their bodies post their\nrealization?\n\nTeacher: Intentional identifica=\r\ntion with the personality by permission\nfrom the power station to fulfill s=\r\nome higher purpose of the power\nstation to guide more batteries to realize =\r\nthat they are not toys. But\nthey can leave in an instant, because they know=\r\n realities that are much\nhigher than our world.\n\nStudent : So what is moksh=\r\na?\n\nTeacher : It is a concept that is best left alone, if you haven&#39;t merge=\r\nd\nback with a power station yourself first. You tell me when you have\nmerge=\r\nd back, how do you know what if feels like to be merged back? You\nyourself =\r\nhave become one with your source, so &quot;you&quot; don&#39;t remain, even\nthe battery h=\r\nas dissolved, so how do &quot;you&quot; explain it? You wont remember\nit, because you=\r\n are not there.\n\nStudent : I can&#39;t explain it.\n\nTeacher : We can&#39;t, It is l=\r\nike explaining the color red to a blind man.\nYou will say mars  is red or t=\r\nhe red light is red, he will say I have\nbeen blind from birth I don&#39;t know =\r\nwhat you are talking about. You will\nsay tomato, he will say fuck off.\n\nStu=\r\ndent : Yes, so It can&#39;t be explained.\n\nTeacher : it can be to an extent, bu=\r\nt it is one ridiculously convoluted\ntopic. To add to ti, one toy is a teddy=\r\n bear, one toy is a car, one toy\nis a helicopter, one toy is a turtle, mind=\r\n you battery is the same, but\nthe car is very different form the toy, thus =\r\nif you explain a high level\nconcept to both, both will understand different=\r\nly and have a go at it\nwith debates and what not, which leads to more confu=\r\nsion. Better is both\nrealize it themselves. So you focus on realizing that =\r\nyou are duracell\nfirst, mr chaman, everything else comes later. Thus, You a=\r\nre duracell.\nNow time for my reward for my winning the bet. Dance naked on =\r\nthe road.\n\nStudent : What?\n\nTeacher : You thought 4 times.\n\nStudent: But I =\r\nwill be disgraced.\n\nTeacher : Nope, Chaman will be, you are duracell, they =\r\nwill laugh at\nChaman, who is your 67432nd incarnation, you have done this t=\r\nhousand\ntimes before, so what??\n\nStudent : I hate you.\n\nTeacher : I love yo=\r\nu too.\n\nStudent : You are serious on this?\n\nTeacher : Very\n\nStudent: : This=\r\n is why some of the higher ones don&#39;t give a shit about\nroaming naked and d=\r\noing wild stuff, just to keep people away from them.\n\nTeacher : Yes, but a =\r\nlot of frauds copy and disgrace the higher ones.\n\nStudent : Fine, I will do=\r\n it. But you will handle my parent&#39;s reaction.\n\nTeacher : Done.\n\nAfter the =\r\nstudent did the act, nobody seemed to recall the act the next\nday, yet ever=\r\ny one saw it that day, and seemed to make faces at the\nstudent for an hour =\r\nor so. How everybody forgot is a different story\naltogether.\n\nDo sadhana, b=\r\nefore your battery is pulled out, replugged into another\ntoy and yet again,=\r\n your confusion will prevail driving you to do things\nthat will push you fu=\r\nrther and further down.\n\nJai Shree Radheya!!\n\n\n\n\n"}}
