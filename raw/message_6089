All the mind=E2=80=99s perc=\r\neptions have their\nroot in the perception of the difference between the Sel=\r\nf and the non-Self.\n\n198 This is the persuasion =E2=80=98I am this body=E2=\r\n=80=99, which is the root-cause of the\ntree of samsara. And since this pers=\r\nuasion is declared to be ignorance, all\ndifferences are the outcome of igno=\r\nrance.\n\n199 The mind, which is named =E2=80=98the soul=E2=80=99, itself cre=\r\nates and perceives these\ndifferences through ignorance. There are no differ=\r\nences in the state of deep\nsleep. And in the supreme state there are no dif=\r\nferences, specifically the\ndifference between God and the soul and all the =\r\nrest.\n\n200 For this reason all the pairs and the triads are unreal. They ar=\r\ne\nnon-existent in the natural state of the Self, and the one that dwells in=\r\n\nthat state, the supreme state, is unaffected by them.\n\nThe pairs are exemp=\r\nlified in the next two verses.\n\n201-2 The Master declares that all these [l=\r\nisted items], and any similar\nentities, are [unreal] like dreams because th=\r\neir root-cause is the ego\nsense: the difference of inside and outside, birt=\r\nh and death, the totality\nand the units, the creation and the\ndissolution o=\r\nf the world, darkness and light, the Self and the not-Self,\nbondage and del=\r\niverance, knowledge and ignorance, the soul and God, free\nwill and fate, pl=\r\neasure and pain, bad and good qualities, and merit and sin.\n\nThese are pair=\r\ns of opposites called dvandvas. The triads (triputis) are\ndiscussed next.\n\n=\r\n203 The knower, the objects of his knowledge, which are non-Self, and his\nk=\r\nnowledge of objects, and everything else that similarly comprises these\nthr=\r\nee factors are said to be unreal, like dreams, because they are the\noutcome=\r\n of ignorance.The world is found on scrutiny to consist of these\npairs and =\r\ntriads. The first pair to be dealt with is that of the soul and\nGod.\n\n204 T=\r\nhe two, namely those named =E2=80=98the soul=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98God=E2=\r\n=80=99, which are created and\nprojected on the real Self by ignorance, are =\r\nnot different from each other.\nThis difference is perceived during the prev=\r\nalence of ignorance, due to the\nidentification with a form that is assumed =\r\nto be real.\n\nApart from the limitation imposed by the form, the two are the=\r\n same. This is\nexplained next.\n\n205 Maya is the body [or attribute] of God.=\r\n Ignorance is that of the soul.\nMaya is subject to that Supreme One. But th=\r\ne soul is subject to ignorance.\n\n206 Maya and ignorance are mentioned in th=\r\ne sacred lore in order to account\nfor the difference between the soul and G=\r\nod. This difference, being rooted\nin the ignorance, is unreal, but it is [r=\r\negarded as] real from the\nstandpoint of worldly activity.\n\nThis is the expl=\r\nanation of diversity, also called duality. This will appear\nas real as long=\r\n as the cause, this ignorance, prevails.\n\n207 Duality will continue to appe=\r\nar to be real, so long as this quality of\nbeing a =E2=80=98soul=E2=80=99 do=\r\nes not cease by right awareness [of the Self]. For this\nreason, this differ=\r\nence will appear as real, just like all other differences\nhere.\n\n208 The un=\r\nreality of the three =E2=80=93 namely the world, God and the soul =E2=80=93=\r\n is\ntaught as a single indivisible truth. It is not possible to use one hal=\r\nf of\na hen for cooking and the other half for laying eggs.\n\nThe analogy is =\r\nto impress the truth taught here that the three mentioned are\nreal or unrea=\r\nl as one whole, and not separately. So the teaching of their\nunreality cann=\r\not be accepted in regard to one, and rejected for the other\ntwo. This will =\r\nbecome clear later.\n\n209 For the one who regards himself as the owner or dw=\r\neller in the body, as\nbeing a =E2=80=98soul=E2=80=99, the real Self himself=\r\n becomes God. Such a one should\npractise devotion to Him for the sake of de=\r\nliverance.\n\nThis need for devotion exists even for an advaitin, a believer =\r\nin\nnon-difference, as is shown below.\n\n210 Such a one who knows the truth o=\r\nf non-difference by the intellect alone,\nbut is unable to achieve experienc=\r\ne of the true nature of the real Self,\nmust strive to attain deliverance by=\r\n devotion and self-surrender to God.\n\nThere are two paths prescribed, becau=\r\nse of a difference in qualifications.\nThis is explained next.\n\n211 Only two=\r\n paths are laid down for the aspirant to deliverance: for the\nvaliant, the =\r\nquest of one=E2=80=99s own Self, and for the fearful, self-surrender to\nGod=\r\n. In these two all the paths are included.\n\nA great many paths are known an=\r\nd followed, but all come under these two. The\nvaliant one has been already =\r\ndescribed. The other is the one who is afraid\nof samsara, but is unable to =\r\ntake to the quest taught by Bhagavan as being\nthe direct path. On this dire=\r\nct path all preconceived notions are dropped,\nas will be seen later. Self-s=\r\nurrender is the final step in the practice of\ndevotion to God, which is the=\r\n only other alternative to the direct path.\n\n212 This two-fold path has bee=\r\nn taught by the most holy one, Ramana,\nthus: =E2=80=98Either\nseek the root =\r\nof the ego-sense [the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 that rises within the body] or\nsu=\r\nrrender that ego-sense to God to have it destroyed [by His grace].=E2=80=99=\r\n\n\nThe advaitin who looks down upon devotion as inferior is next censured.\n\n=\r\n213 That foolish man, who, considering himself as an advaitin, but not bein=\r\ng\nvaliant enough [to take to the quest as taught by Bhagavan] and who looks=\r\n\ndown upon devotion as inferior, lives in vain, without devotion to God. He=\r\n\nis a man with a tainted mind.\n\nThe devotee is next shown to be better off =\r\nthan the rest of men.\n\n214 In this samsara the devotee is like a pot let do=\r\nwn into a well with a\nrope tied to it. The man without devotion is like a p=\r\not fallen into the\nwell, without a rope being tied to it.\n\nThe meaning is t=\r\nhat the devotee is destined to be rescued from samsara by\nGod=E2=80=99s gra=\r\nce, but not so those who have no devotion.\n\nThe path of devotion is dealt w=\r\nith next.\n\n215 Those who are endowed with the diabolic temperament cannot h=\r\nave the\nright kind of devotion. Hence the good one should take hold of the =\r\ndivine\ntemperament for practising devotion to God.\n\n216 The power of God, w=\r\nell-known in the world as grace, has three forms:\nGod, the Supreme Being; t=\r\nhe Holy Guru; and the real Self in the supreme\nstate.\n\nThese three are thus=\r\n declared to be one. Devotion to God leads to the\nfinding of the Guru, who =\r\nis God Himself. Devotion to the Guru leads on to\nright awareness of the Sel=\r\nf, which is none other than God.\n\n217 This Grace [of God] is merely the fac=\r\nt that He Himself is present in the\nHeart as the real Self. Grace is the ve=\r\nry nature of that supreme one, and\nwithout grace He can have no existence.\n=\r\n\n218 That grace of God is ever wide-awake; there is never a time when that\n=\r\ngrace is absent. But so long as man=E2=80=99s ego-sense is alive, he needs =\r\neffort on\nhis part.\n\n219 That grace of God will not desert any one; she wil=\r\nl [surely] lead all to\ndeliverance. Some will be delivered soon; others aft=\r\ner a long time.\n\n220 The devotee may think, =E2=80=98I am practising devoti=\r\non to God by my own\nefforts, but this is not true, because it is God who pu=\r\nrsues the deluded\nsoul, who wanders blindly in the forest of samsara, and t=\r\nakes hold of him\n[by His grace].\n\nIt is next shown that God=E2=80=99s grace=\r\n is immeasurable.\n\n221 The extent of God=E2=80=99s grace is so much, He giv=\r\nes Himself to devotees: for\nwhen, by His grace, the ego is destroyed, the a=\r\nspirant obtains the state of\nnot being different from Him.\n\nThis is one of =\r\nthe sayings of Bhagavan.\n\n222 God is that kind of magnetic mountain which d=\r\nraws the souls to Himself,\nmakes them motionless and consumes them [like fo=\r\nod] and ever after\nsafeguards them in the supreme state, endless bliss, whi=\r\nch is His own state.\n\nThis truth is set forth in the 6th and 11th verses of=\r\n one of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s\nhymns to Sri Arunachala, Arunachala Dasakam.\n\nAl=\r\nl souls are destined to reach this goal by divine grace. This is described\n=\r\nin the next verses, whose theme is taken from the eighth verse of Bhagavan=\r\n=E2=80=99s\nArunachala Ashtakam.\n\n223-4 As the river, born from the rains of=\r\n the clouds that rise from the\nsea, returns to its source, the sea, and as =\r\nthe bird, wandering a long time\nin the sky, obtains rest by returning to [i=\r\nts home on] earth, so the soul,\nwhich has originated in the supreme one, af=\r\nter wandering in this samsara for\nan immense period of time, returns in the=\r\n reverse direction and rejoins that\nsupreme one, from where it originated.\n=\r\n\n225 Devotion is taught as being of two kinds, according to the degree of\nr=\r\nipeness of the devotee; in the beginning it is devotion like that of the\nba=\r\nby monkey, and afterwards devotion like that of the kitten.\n\nThe baby monke=\r\ny keeps hold of its mother by its own effort, whereas the\nkitten makes no e=\r\nffort, but relies entirely on the mother cat. The unripe\ndevotee is like th=\r\ne former and the ripe one is like the latter; the former\nhas his egoism ram=\r\npant; the egoism of the latter is greatly subdued, and\nhence he is the reci=\r\npient of more abundant grace, and reaches the goal much\nsooner.\n\n226 After =\r\npractising devotion like that of the baby monkey through a great\nmany lives=\r\n, in the end, when his egoism is greatly reduced, he practises\ndevotion lik=\r\ne the kitten.\n\n227 The devotion that is like the kitten=E2=80=99s is the sa=\r\nme as taking refuge at\nthe feet of God and surrendering to Him. This devoti=\r\non, becoming further\npurified by the refinement of the mind, becomes equal =\r\nto right awareness in\ncourse of time.\n\n228 There is the saying of the most =\r\nholy one that real surrender is that\nwhich is made by he who knows the trut=\r\nh of himself by the quest of the Self.\n\nSelf-surrender is real and effectiv=\r\ne to the extent that the ego-sense is\nattenuated. Hence, so long as the ego=\r\n survives, self-surrender is imperfect\nand incomplete. It becomes complete =\r\nand fruitful only when the ego dies once\nfor all, never to revive.\n\n229 Dev=\r\notion is also of two kinds: one with a sense of separateness and the\nother =\r\nwith a sense of non-difference. The former is prescribed for the\nunrefined;=\r\n the latter is excellent for the well-refined ones.\n\nThe sense of differenc=\r\ne detracts from the quality of devotion. He who is\nconvinced that differenc=\r\nes are not true is alone capable of the real\nsurrender of himself; hence hi=\r\ns devotion is superior. But, as is shown next,\ndevotion with a sense of dif=\r\nference is not to be despised.\n\n230 If one, considering Him, who is only th=\r\ne Self, as other than oneself,\nworships Him in a form and by a name, then i=\r\nn course of time, through the\nclarification of his intellect, he surely rea=\r\nches the supreme state. There\nis no doubt about this.\n\nAscribing a form and=\r\n a name to God is unavoidable for those who, being\nunable to take to the di=\r\nrect path, nevertheless want deliverance and wish to\nworship God to win His=\r\n grace.\n\nThe ignorance and narrowness of those followers of religions that =\r\ncondemn\nthe use of images in divine worship was well exposed by Bhagavan in=\r\n a talk\nwith some Muslims, which is reported in Maha Yoga and in Talks with=\r\n Sri\nRamana Maharshi. The gist of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s reply to the Muslims w=\r\nas that one\nwho thinks himself to be a form, a mortal body =E2=80=93 while =\r\nreally being really\nformless and nameless =E2=80=93 has no right to raise t=\r\nhis question. During the\nstate of ignorance it is permissible for a sincere=\r\n devotee to regard God as\nhaving a form and a name, and to use images or sy=\r\nmbols to facilitate\nworship. There is another saying of Bhagavan, which is =\r\ngiven in the next\nverse.\n\nSource: http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_int=\r\nro.shtml\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=\r\n=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016368340c03672ff049fabe6ac\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n197 Hence the totality of all these differences, experienced by =\r\nthe unwise, exists only in the mind=E2=80=99s perception.

And in the =\r\nsupreme state there are no differences, specifically the difference between=\r\n God and the soul and all the rest.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;200 For this reason all=\r\n the pairs and the triads are unreal. They are non-existent in the natural =\r\nstate of the Self, and the one that dwells in that state, the supreme state=\r\n, is unaffected by them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The pairs are exemplified in the next two v=\r\nerses.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;201-2 The Master declares that all these [listed items], an=\r\nd any similar entities, are [unreal] like dreams because their root-cause i=\r\ns the ego sense: the difference of inside and outside, birth and death, the=\r\n totality and the units, the creation and the&lt;br&gt;\n\ndissolution of the world=\r\n, darkness and light, the Self and the not-Self, bondage and deliverance, k=\r\nnowledge and ignorance, the soul and God, free will and fate, pleasure and =\r\npain, bad and good qualities, and merit and sin.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;These are pairs o=\r\nf opposites called dvandvas. The triads (triputis) are discussed next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;203 The knower, the objects of his knowledge, which are non-Self, and hi=\r\ns knowledge of objects, and everything else that similarly comprises these =\r\nthree factors are said to be unreal, like dreams, because they are the outc=\r\nome of ignorance.The world is found on scrutiny to consist of these pairs a=\r\nnd triads. The first pair to be dealt with is that of the soul and God.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;204 The two, namely those named =E2=80=98the soul=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=\r\n=98God=E2=80=99, which are created and projected on the real Self by ignora=\r\nnce, are not different from each other. This difference is perceived during=\r\n the prevalence of ignorance, due to the identification with a form that is=\r\n assumed to be real.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Apart from the limitation imposed by the form=\r\n, the two are the same. This is explained next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;205 Maya is the body=\r\n [or attribute] of God. Ignorance is that of the soul. Maya is subject to t=\r\nhat Supreme One. But the soul is subject to ignorance.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;206 Maya an=\r\nd ignorance are mentioned in the sacred lore in order to account for the di=\r\nfference between the soul and God. This difference, being rooted in the ign=\r\norance, is unreal, but it is [regarded as] real from the standpoint of worl=\r\ndly activity.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This is the explanation of diversity, also called du=\r\nality. This will appear as real as long as the cause, this ignorance, preva=\r\nils.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;207 Duality will continue to appear to be real, so long as this=\r\n quality of being a =E2=80=98soul=E2=80=99 does not cease by right awarenes=\r\ns [of the Self]. For this reason, this difference will appear as real, just=\r\n like all other differences here.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;208 The unreality of the three =\r\n=E2=80=93 namely the world, God and the soul =E2=80=93 is taught as a singl=\r\ne indivisible truth. It is not possible to use one half of a hen for cookin=\r\ng and the other half for laying eggs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The analogy is to impress the =\r\ntruth taught here that the three mentioned are real or unreal as one whole,=\r\n and not separately. So the teaching of their unreality cannot be accepted =\r\nin regard to one, and rejected for the other two. This will become clear la=\r\nter.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;209 For the one who regards himself as the owner or dweller i=\r\nn the body, as being a =E2=80=98soul=E2=80=99, the real Self himself become=\r\ns God. Such a one should practise devotion to Him for the sake of deliveran=\r\nce.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This need for devotion exists even for an advaitin, a believer i=\r\nn non-difference, as is shown below.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;210 Such a one who knows the =\r\ntruth of non-difference by the intellect alone, but is unable to achieve ex=\r\nperience of the true nature of the real Self, must strive to attain deliver=\r\nance by devotion and self-surrender to God.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;There are two paths pr=\r\nescribed, because of a difference in qualifications. This is explained next=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;211 Only two paths are laid down for the aspirant to deliverance: =\r\nfor the valiant, the quest of one=E2=80=99s own Self, and for the fearful, =\r\nself-surrender to God. In these two all the paths are included.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;A =\r\ngreat many paths are known and followed, but all come under these two. The =\r\nvaliant one has been already described. The other is the one who is afraid =\r\nof samsara, but is unable to take to the quest taught by Bhagavan as being =\r\nthe direct path. On this direct path all preconceived notions are dropped, =\r\nas will be seen later.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Self-surrender=\r\n is the final step in the practice of devotion to God, which is the only ot=\r\nher alternative to the direct path.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;212 This two-fold path =\r\nhas been taught by the most holy one, Ramana, thus:=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=E2=80=98Either seek the root of the ego-sense [the =E2=80=\r\n=98I=E2=80=99 that rises within the body] or surrender that ego-sense to Go=\r\nd to have it destroyed [by His grace].=E2=80=99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The advaiti=\r\nn who looks down upon devotion as inferior is next censured.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;213 Tha=\r\nt foolish man, who, considering himself as an advaitin, but not being valia=\r\nnt enough [to take to the quest as taught by Bhagavan] and who looks down u=\r\npon devotion as inferior, lives in vain, without devotion to God. He is a m=\r\nan with a tainted mind.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The devotee is next shown to be better off=\r\n than the rest of men.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;214 In this samsara the devotee is like a pot=\r\n let down into a well with a rope tied to it. The man without devotion is l=\r\nike a pot fallen into the well, without a rope being tied to it.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;T=\r\nhe meaning is that the devotee is destined to be rescued from samsara by Go=\r\nd=E2=80=99s grace, but not so those who have no devotion.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The path o=\r\nf devotion is dealt with next.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;215 Those who are endowed with the di=\r\nabolic temperament cannot have the right kind of devotion. Hence the good o=\r\nne should take hold of the divine temperament for practising devotion to Go=\r\nd.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;216 The power of God, well-known in the world as grace, has thr=\r\nee forms: God, the Supreme Being; the Holy Guru; and the real Self in the s=\r\nupreme state.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;These three are thus declared to be one. Devotion to G=\r\nod leads to the finding of the Guru, who is God Himself. Devotion to the Gu=\r\nru leads on to right awareness of the Self, which is none other than God.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;217 This Grace [of God] is merely the fact that He Himself is prese=\r\nnt in the Heart as the real Self. Grace is the very nature of that supreme =\r\none, and without grace He can have no existence.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;218 That grace of G=\r\nod is ever wide-awake; there is never a time when that grace is absent. But=\r\n so long as man=E2=80=99s ego-sense is alive, he needs effort on his part.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;219 That grace of God will not desert any one; she will [surely] l=\r\nead all to deliverance. Some will be delivered soon; others after a long ti=\r\nme.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;220 The devotee may think, =E2=80=98I am practising devotion to =\r\nGod by my own efforts, but this is not true, because it is God who pursues =\r\nthe deluded soul, who wanders blindly in the forest of samsara, and takes h=\r\nold of him [by His grace].&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It is next shown that God=E2=80=99s gra=\r\nce is immeasurable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;221 The extent of God=E2=80=99s grace is so much=\r\n, He gives Himself to devotees: for when, by His grace, the ego is destroye=\r\nd, the aspirant obtains the state of not being different from Him.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;This is one of the sayings of Bhagavan.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;222 God is that kind of mag=\r\nnetic mountain which draws the souls to Himself, makes them motionless and =\r\nconsumes them [like food] and ever after safeguards them in the supreme sta=\r\nte, endless bliss, which is His own state.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;This truth is set forth=\r\n in the 6th and 11th verses of one of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s hymns to Sri Aruna=\r\nchala, Arunachala Dasakam.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;All souls are destined to reach this goal=\r\n by divine grace. This is described in the next verses, whose theme is take=\r\nn from the eighth verse of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Arunachala Ashtakam.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;223-4 As the river, born from the rains o=\r\nf the clouds that rise from the sea, returns to its source, the sea, and as=\r\n the bird, wandering a long time in the sky, obtains rest by returning to [=\r\nits home on] earth, so the soul, which has originated in the supreme one, a=\r\nfter wandering in this samsara for an immense period of time, returns in th=\r\ne reverse direction and rejoins that supreme one, from where it originated.=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;225 Devotion is taught as=\r\n being of two kinds, according to the degree of ripeness of the devotee; in=\r\n the beginning it is devotion like that of the baby monkey, and afterwards =\r\ndevotion like that of the kitten.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The baby monkey keeps hold of it=\r\ns mother by its own effort, whereas the kitten makes no effort, but relies =\r\nentirely on the mother cat. The unripe devotee is like the former and the r=\r\nipe one is like the latter; the former has his egoism rampant; the egoism o=\r\nf the latter is greatly subdued, and hence he is the recipient of more abun=\r\ndant grace, and reaches the goal much sooner.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;226 After practising devotion like that of the baby m=\r\nonkey through a great many lives, in the end, when his egoism is greatly re=\r\nduced, he practises devotion like the kitten.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;227 The devoti=\r\non that is like the kitten=E2=80=99s is the same as taking refuge at the fe=\r\net of God and surrendering to Him. This devotion, becoming further purified=\r\n by the refinement of the mind, becomes equal to right awareness in course =\r\nof time.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;228 There is the saying of the most holy one that real su=\r\nrrender is that which is made by he who knows the truth of himself by the q=\r\nuest of the Self.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Self-surrender is real and effective to the extent=\r\n that the ego-sense is attenuated. Hence, so long as the ego survives, self=\r\n-surrender is imperfect and incomplete. It becomes complete and fruitful on=\r\nly when the ego dies once for all, never to revive.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;229 Devotion i=\r\ns also of two kinds: one with a sense of separateness and the other with a =\r\nsense of non-difference. The former is prescribed for the unrefined; the la=\r\ntter is excellent for the well-refined ones.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThe sense of differenc=\r\ne detracts from the quality of devotion. He who is convinced that differenc=\r\nes are not true is alone capable of the real surrender of himself; hence hi=\r\ns devotion is superior. But, as is shown next, devotion with a sense of dif=\r\nference is not to be despised.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;230 If one, considering Him, who is=\r\n only the Self, as other than oneself, worships Him in a form and by a name=\r\n, then in course of time, through the clarification of his intellect, he su=\r\nrely reaches the supreme state. There is no doubt about this.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Ascr=\r\nibing a form and a name to God is unavoidable for those who, being unable t=\r\no take to the direct path, nevertheless want deliverance and wish to worshi=\r\np God to win His grace.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The ignoran=\r\nce and narrowness of those followers of religions that condemn the use of i=\r\nmages in divine worship was well exposed by Bhagavan in a talk with some Mu=\r\nslims, which is reported in Maha Yoga and in Talks with Sri Ramana Maharshi=\r\n. The gist of Bhagavan=E2=80=99s reply to the Muslims was that one who thin=\r\nks himself to be a form, a mortal body =E2=80=93 while really being really =\r\nformless and nameless =E2=80=93 has no right to raise this question. During=\r\n the state of ignorance it is permissible for a sincere devotee to regard G=\r\nod as having a form and a name, and to use images or symbols to facilitate =\r\nworship.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0There is another saying of Bhagavan, which is given in=\r\n the next verse.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;=\r\na href=3D&quot;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&quot; target=3D&quot;_bla=\r\nnk&quot;&gt;http://www.davidgodman.org/rteach/rpv_intro.shtml&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;clea=\r\nr:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px=\r\n;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-=\r\nsize:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0=\r\npx;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82=C2=A0 =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--0016368340c03672ff049fabe6ac--\r\n\n"}}
