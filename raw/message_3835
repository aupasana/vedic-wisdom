I hope you keep up your niyama of p=\r\nerforming Ganapathi Homam. All the best.\n\n1. Generally dawn/morning are bes=\r\nt times to do Ganesha Homam. It is awesome especially at dawn, when it is v=\r\nery quiet outside and dark and still and everyone else is sleeping, and enj=\r\noy the brilliance of fire in total darkness (switch off all the lights). Yo=\r\nu just got to ensure you wake up (not easy for most) and perform your homam=\r\n.\n\n\n2. Keep it simple & practical (economical). Stick to white/black til (s=\r\nesame seeds) and/or poha. Economize so that it becomes affordable. Maybe we=\r\n can, as a group, pool some funds, and help our friends to do homam.\n\n3. Pr=\r\neservation of Semen is very helpful. It is made up of an ethereal substance=\r\n called Ojas, which is responsible for vitality, vigor, rejuvenation, stren=\r\ngth, concentration and many other things including Aura. If you dissipate y=\r\nour semen, this leads to loss of these qualities, including the all-importa=\r\nnt shakti one accumulates by doing sadhana! But, I guess, the only way to c=\r\nontrol is to try and eventually one is bound to succeed, with her grace. Un=\r\nfortunately, Food/Sex/Sleep is such that the more one has it, the more one =\r\nwants it. So beware!\n\n4. What do you mean remove the fire? I let it go down=\r\n naturally. \n\n5. As I said, we can start an initiative, whereby, people who=\r\n can afford it can donate these samagri&#39;s to the lesser privileged, thereby=\r\n earning some good karma&#39;s. But this should be restricted to samagri&#39;s and =\r\nhoma kundam or other relevant materials for homam. No money! If you want to=\r\n donate til seeds, buy it and donate it. \n\nHope this helps.\nRegards\nNarayan=\r\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;biswa108&quot; &lt;biswa1975@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; NAMASKAR to all\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been performing Ganapati Homama for the last=\r\n three weeks, credit goes to all of my seniors/members and Gurus of this be=\r\nautiful forum...\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I need some practical approach best suitable for =\r\nme...\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Suggested / Suitable time to perform ganapati homam(currently=\r\n, I am performing around the time of sunrise, is it suitable at night or be=\r\nfore sunrise too?)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. What substance should not be offered in Ganapati=\r\n homam (bel-leaves should be one in the list, I unknowingly used it and exp=\r\nerience very bad effects!) \n&gt; \n&gt; 3. When the talking of &quot;AGHORA&quot; going on, =\r\nis it really needed to perform &quot;Bramhachariya&quot; for daily ganapati homam? if=\r\n someone can control his/her thinkings during ganapati homam, sex/masturbat=\r\ning/consume non-veg food is really needed? (In my practical experience, con=\r\nsume very low-diet little food at last night are excellent for performing G=\r\nanapati Homama in the morning. my point is, readying our body/mind 5-6 hour=\r\ns before the homama procedure by controlling sex/food are very much useful =\r\nfor me!)\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. Is there any practical methods to keep the fire more times=\r\n in the homam kundam so that more time to spend on meditation?\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. Is t=\r\nhere any cost effective solutions for daily homam in Kolkata, India? Someti=\r\nmes I find expensive for daily ganapati homam. We may ask to create a group=\r\n in Kolkata to use our cumulative purchasing capacity for cheap rate. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n best regards,\n&gt; Biswajit\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
