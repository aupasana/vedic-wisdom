Even if you leave your\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; room with &quot;B=\r\nlack Shades&quot; would be fine and actually more beautiful :)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Answers to your questions:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 1) YES. It is portable. Every day=\r\n I adjust it near my window and after\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; finishing homam, i take it bac=\r\nk little inside so that window can be closed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I am able to adjust it=\r\n myself alone in just a few *seconds*.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 2) It is made of G.I S=\r\nheets (Galvanized Iron) of 22 Gauge. This was\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; manufactured by a Loca=\r\nl EPC contracting company dealing in AC Duct\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; installation. A Technic=\r\nal Supervisor of that company is my close family\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; friend. He did this=\r\n for me. I suggest checking with any Restaurants. They\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all are havin=\r\ng such arrangements and they would be able to help you to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; contact su=\r\nch manufacturers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 3) YES, because it is a Metal (GI Sheet) it=\r\n gets quite heated up. One can\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; not touch during Homam. However, it a=\r\nlso cools down quickly. Within half an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; hour after Homam is finished,=\r\n temperature of the chimney comes down to room\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; temperature.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; 4) It has a Metallic FAN at the end. I was starting that FAN only whe=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Fire goes of and lot of Smoke is generated. Reasons are as follows=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; i)The fan is powerful and makes a lot of noise which disturbs\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; concentration.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ii) In the beginning, when Fire is very small, the=\r\n powerful exhaust by the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; fan, disturbed the flames and sometimes ext=\r\ninguished it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; 1ii) When Fire is there in the Homam, one need not wor=\r\nry about smoke\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; handling. the reason is that the smoke naturally trav=\r\nels upward and it is\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; automatically guided to the exit of the chimney=\r\n. Once the fire becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; strong, it generates vacuum around Homam kun=\r\ndam area and starts pulling\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; outside air. For instance, smoke from in=\r\ncense stick (Agarbatti), though\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; outside of chimney and quite far awa=\r\ny, actually gets diverted into the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Chimney via square opening at the=\r\n bottom. Hence during homam, FAN is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; required.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; iv) =\r\nNow very important thing. I used fan for many months (only at the end\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; of Homas). One day my fear proved right. Due to heat of chimney, the cabl=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of the Fan got burnt and there was a short-circuit. mccb tripped. =\r\nSince then\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I am not using the Fan. You may have to go for Heat resis=\r\ntant cable for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; FAN if you wish to use it but i am fine without u=\r\nsing the fan in my chimney.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Actually without Fan, The whole arrangem=\r\nent will become much Lighter and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; much easier to handle. Please also =\r\ndo not forget to make a support. You can\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; see that in pictures which =\r\nI have loaded. Support is a separate part\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (Please check the P=\r\nicture of Fan which i have added in the Photo section)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; If you=\r\n have further queries, please do not hesitate to ask.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Best Re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, Girish Sundaram &lt;gisundar@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Namas=\r\nkaram Phatakji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; You know what I am faced with the same problem tha=\r\nt you had (and I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sure many\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; others doing regular homam do=\r\n)..

I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; remember\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; different fears i was havin=\r\ng in my mind. I was then staying as a paying\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; guest\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; with a f=\r\namily. though i had a separte room, i was not sure if they would\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all=\r\now\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; me to do something related to fire. that was the main worry. th=\r\nen there\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; was self\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; doubt concerning my ability to perform Ho=\r\nmam but I decided to perform\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and did\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the first Homam which =\r\nwas Maha Ganapati homam on 1st day of Ashwin\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Navaraatri. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nremember that i took me around 2.5 hours total including all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pre=\r\nparation\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; after that rest of the 8 days, i performed Chandi Homams.=\r\n each Chandi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; homam took\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; around 4 hours. I remember that on =\r\nthe Ashtami day, some of My\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; colleagues with\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; family came to =\r\nsee my chandi Homam and they told me that the smoke was\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; even\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; visible in the ground floor (The Apartment i was staying was on 4th) and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; there\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; were nice smell every where. The interesting thing is=\r\n that Old lady of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; family actually co-operated with me. =\r\nshe used to help me in cutting Dray\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; coconut\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in to small pei=\r\nces with knife. I cut my finger on several occasions\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; while\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\ncutting coconuts for chandi homam. I used to offer the blood stained\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n coconut\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; peices in Chandi Homas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; My all previous=\r\n fears thus proved absolutely Non-existent. From the very\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; first\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Homam, It was a smooth ride. I was exahusted after Navaratri and could=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; continue and there was a break of a week or so. Then a=\r\ngain i started\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; daily Maha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Ganapti Homam while learnt the te=\r\nchnic of breaking Dry coconut halves by\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; crushing it with bo=\r\nth palms.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; After few months, I had to look for another Sha=\r\nring Apartment. I tried\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to search\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for it. few families reje=\r\ncted when i put the condition of doing Homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; everyday.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at l=\r\nast One christian family agreed for that. I paid bigger amount but\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; t=\r\nhey\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; allowed me to do homam and i continued there for around 3 mont=\r\nhs. during\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; time i also took vow to do homam and Chadni=\r\n Path everyday for 1 year.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; after 3 months, i started sear=\r\nching for my own separate Rental Apartment\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; because\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; my famil=\r\ny was joining me. Again the same concern (Prime) is to search\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Apartment where there is no obstacle to do Homam. I got a brand new\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; apartment. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; observed the flat and finalised the dealing. c=\r\nontinued Homam every day\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; for 1\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; year. The whole flat became =\r\nblack. even the Home applicances liem\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; refrigerator\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; etc.. we=\r\nre covered with black dust of Homa smoke. clothes in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wardrobe,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Openings of Central A/c etc... were all filled with black dust. My =\r\nwhole\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; brand\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; new apartment became dark due to the Homam. Smo=\r\nke particles travelled to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; lungs and throat and i started=\r\n coughing badly. I suffered with severe\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Cough for\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; many mont=\r\nhs and there was pressure from near ones to stop Homam or\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; atleast\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; perform it once every week. But there was lot of determination provi=\r\nded\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; by *some\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; power* which i like to call as &quot;Mother&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; After 1 year in that Apartment, i started serching different p=\r\nlace. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; searched\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; whole area and was looking for a apartment=\r\n which also has Balcony so\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that My\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; homam goes smoothly with=\r\nout nmaking my whole aprtment look black and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; there are\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; no m=\r\nore complaints from my wife .\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I could not get one such perfect pla=\r\nce which gives me a Blacony and at\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; time there are =\r\nno buidlings in front which can observe me doing homam in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; balcony\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and make a instant complaint to police and/or fire Brigade. Balcony =\r\nwas\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; very\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; comfirtable and required option so that i can do i=\r\nt there and smoke\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; handling\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; becomes very easy but at the sam=\r\ne time it is also that much risky\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; because any\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; road-side per=\r\nson can complain seeing smoke comming out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Finally i got one aprtm=\r\nent without balcony but with a special location.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; When i\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; vac=\r\nated the previous apartment, the owner&#39;e representative was\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; shell-sh=\r\nocked\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; looking at the condition of the apartment :) He told me over=\r\n Phone -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Aaap Kya\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; karata tha flat me?&quot;. He then deducted 1=\r\n000 AED from my deposit for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; compensation. I happily agreed bec=\r\nause i knew that it was a great deal\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; instaed\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of going to po=\r\nlice station.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In new Apartment (current one), security is=\r\n very tight. But I decided to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; make an\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; arrangement so that i=\r\n do not *spoil* condition of the Apartment. hence i\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; came\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ou=\r\nt with the Idea of Chimney. (Please see the more pictures in photo\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; s=\r\nection)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and started doing Homam. Though the chimney is visible to =\r\nneighbours and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; other\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; flat owners, no body has complained ti=\r\nll now. neither to police nor to\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; security\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; personnel. Only o=\r\nnce Security person cautiuoned me. I stopped for a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; days and\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; started as usual. It is going on till today. I do not know about\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; tomorrow but i\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; do not worry. becuase after 2.5 years of experien=\r\nce, it is more than\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; clear to me\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that It is not I who is arr=\r\nanging all these but there is Mother behind\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; these. SHE =\r\nis making my road clear so that i can perform Homam as i\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wish.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; The moral of the story is that if you genuinely d=\r\nesire to perform\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Homam/Havan,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; then It will be done. No obst=\r\nacle will stand on your way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Do not fear. All the fears will break=\r\n like Papads once you start walking\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; over\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; them to do homam. =\r\ni can swear for it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; No owner will kick you out, No neighb=\r\nour will call 9-1-1 and even if\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; happens, there will op=\r\nen a way!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nPS: Forgive me for spellings and Grammar!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;astro_student75&quot; &lt;astro.sishya@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks very much for the p=\r\nhoto.
