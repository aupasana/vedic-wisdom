(139)\n\nSo long as one has the noti=\r\non =E2=80=98I am the body=E2=80=99, he does not become illumined,\neven thou=\r\ngh he has (the merit of) great self-discipline; look upon him as\nonly a sad=\r\nhaka (one that is on the path). (127)\n\nAs a lion seen in a dream by an elep=\r\nhant, awakens him; so the Guru, who is a\nsage, awakens the disciple from th=\r\ne dream of ignorance. (135)\n\nTrue adoration is becoming dissolved in the se=\r\na of the homogeneous essence\nof the Experience of the Self, just as hail ge=\r\nts dissolved in the sea. (140)\n\nAs a deer seized by a tiger (cannot escape)=\r\n, so a disciple on whom the\nGuru=E2=80=99s gracious looks have rested will =\r\nnever be let go, but will surely be\nled to the State of Kaivalyam. (143)\n\nI=\r\nt is by delusion that one says: =E2=80=98I have seen this Sage, I shall see=\r\n that\none also;=E2=80=99 if he knows the Sage that is within himself, then =\r\nall Sages will\nbe (seen to be) one and the same. (131)\n\nThe Guru reduces on=\r\nly the unreal to nothing, and (thus) causing the one Real\nSelf to shine; th=\r\nereby he kills, without killing, the false ego. (132)\n\nAdoration of the Gur=\r\nu is just not taking back the gift, by means of the\nideas, =E2=80=98I=E2=80=\r\n=99 and =E2=80=98mine=E2=80=99, after surrendering to the Guru everything i=\r\nncluding\nthe body. (142)\n\nThe meaning of the saying that one should not app=\r\nroach the Guru\nempty-handed, is simply this. =E2=80=9COne should go to him,=\r\n who is not distinct\nfrom the Supreme Being, with heart full of love=E2=80=\r\n=9D. (141)\n\nAs in a great forest, a roving robust elephant, seeing the eyes=\r\n of a lion in\nthe darkness of night, loses life and is eaten up by him, so =\r\nthe ego, named\n=E2=80=98I=E2=80=99, roving in the forest of Relativity, is =\r\nkilled by the Guru by mere\nsight, and is eaten up by Him, out of Grace. (13=\r\n3 & 134)\n\nKnow that he who regards the Guru, who is enlightened and is noth=\r\ning but\nunlimited Pure Consciousness as a mere human being is a most sinful=\r\n person\nwith a impure mind. (128)\n\nSages alone are the virtuous ones; ignor=\r\nant ones are without virtue;\ntherefore, for the sake of Deliverance, one sh=\r\nould cultivate the society of\nthe Sages, who are delivered from the untruth=\r\n. (138)\n\nThe teaching of the Guru is just the dwelling in the Heart, throug=\r\nh the\nExperience of the One Reality, won by turning the one-pointed mind in=\r\nwards\nafter understanding that Truth (intellectually). (137)\n\nSages alone a=\r\nre the virtuous ones; ignorant ones are without virtue;\ntherefore, for the =\r\nsake of Deliverance, one should cultivate the society of\nthe Sages, who are=\r\n delivered from the untruth. (138)\n\nThe teaching of the Guru is just the dw=\r\nelling in the Heart, through the\nExperience of the One Reality, won by turn=\r\ning the one-pointed mind inwards\nafter understanding that Truth (intellectu=\r\nally). (137)\n\nThe Supreme Lord Himself appears as Guru in human form to the=\r\n aspirant,\nbeing pleased with (his) devotion. (129)\n\nFor those who shine as=\r\n Self, which is Grace =E2=80=93 since their mind, is the form\nof ignorance,=\r\n has died =E2=80=93 everything and every place will be found to be\nsupremel=\r\ny Blissful in their divine view, which emerged as Self-Existence.\n(346)\n\nFi=\r\nrmly abiding as =E2=80=98I am I=E2=80=99, without any movement of the mind,=\r\n is the\nattainment of Godhood (Sivatvasiddhi). (Because) the shining of the=\r\n truly\nwell-established state of knowledge (Self-knowledge) where nothing e=\r\nxists\nother than that (knowledge) is pure Siva? (900)\n\nListen to the clue t=\r\no attain the reality which abides (as =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99) within the\nkn=\r\nowledge (the mind) as the knowledge to the knowledge (i.e, as the Self\nwhic=\r\nh gives light to the mind); to scrutinize and cognize the object (the\nmind)=\r\n by that same knowledge (enquiring =E2=80=98What is it?=E2=80=99 or Who am =\r\nI?=E2=80=99) is the\nmeans to abide within (as the reality). (899)\n\nThe divi=\r\nne life (of abiding as Self) alone is the life of supreme reality.\nOn the o=\r\nther hand, life in the world which is seen, is a life of delusion.\nWhat an =\r\nillusion (maya) it is to love a life of fear (fearing death). Is not\nthat (=\r\nlife of fear) merely (one=E2=80=99s ) drowning in the play of the\nmind-illu=\r\nsion? (1095)\n\nRealization is for everyone. Realization makes no difference =\r\nbetween the\naspirants. This very doubt, whether you can realize, and the no=\r\ntion\n=E2=80=98I-have-not-realized=E2=80=99 are themselves the obstacles. Be=\r\n free from these\nobstacles. (Maharshi=E2=80=99s Gospal)\n\nGuru, the Lord of =\r\nJnana, who is the power of the unlimited greatness of\nSelf, is the Supreme =\r\nSilence which completely defeats the worthless\narguments of those who are s=\r\ntained with the delusion of worldly desires.\n(Guru Vachaka Kovai 280)\n\nBy e=\r\nnquiring, =E2=80=9CWho am I, the deluded one who suffers so much?=E2=80=9D,=\r\n the delusion\nwill be dissolved, the Reality will be attained, Jnana will d=\r\nawn, Mouna will\nflow forth and the Bliss of Peace will prevail. (404)\n\nThe =\r\nSelf is God. =E2=80=98I AM=E2=80=99 is God. If God be apart from the Self, =\r\nHe must be a\nSelfless God which is absurd. All that is required to realize =\r\nthe Self is to\nbe still. What can be easier than that? Hence atma vidya is =\r\nthe easiest to\nattain. (Maharshi=E2=80=99s Gospal)\n\nThose people who lack c=\r\nonsciousness of being, the natural light (I am) and\nwho consequently come, =\r\nthrough, ignorance, under the spell of karma and\nsuffer, will have their de=\r\nlusion ended and reach the self, the supreme\nreality, through meditation on=\r\n a divine from that is dear to them. (Guru\nVachaka Kovai 659)\n\nTo realize t=\r\nhat you yourself are the Self, why do you require any light\nother than bein=\r\ng-consciousness, the light of the Self? (759)\n\nWhat our Lord Ramana teaches=\r\n us to take as the greatest and powerful tapas,\nis only this much =E2=80=93=\r\n summa iru (Be still). There is no other duty for the\nmind and its thoughts=\r\n (Muruganar, 773)\n\nIf the jiva remains without cognizing the object, in tha=\r\nt state it will\nclearly see itself as the immaculate pure swarupa, free fro=\r\nm limitations.\n(646)\n\nBhagavan is always with you, in you and you are yours=\r\nelf Bhagavan.\n\nOnly the attainment of tranquility of mind is God=E2=80=99s =\r\ngrace, not the\nfulfillment of one=E2=80=99s desires. (753)\n\nLiving as the S=\r\nelf is the essence of all dharmas. All other dharmas merge\nhere. (705)\n\nThe=\r\n lazy state of just being and shining is the state of self, and that is\nthe=\r\n highest state that one can attain. Revere as the most virtuous those who\nh=\r\nave attained that (lazy) state which cannot be attained except by very\ngrea=\r\nt and rare tapas. (774)\n\nIn the blissful experience of jnana, the Self, tho=\r\nse prarabdha experiences\nwill not cling to the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99. (698)\n\n=\r\nDeepavali festival signifies the great Self-effulgence which shines after\nd=\r\nestroying the reflected artificial light (i.e. the ego) Narakasura, who was=\r\n\nruling this filthy body which is the form of hell, as I. (189)\n\nBefore you=\r\n embark on treating the disease of others, first completely\ndestroy your ow=\r\nn disease, and only then start your practice. (804)\n\nSince charya (devotion=\r\n and detachment) alone sustains sadhana, observe and\ncherish it in an appro=\r\npriate way, without ever slackening. (826)\n\nSince the moral and religious o=\r\nbservances that have been laid down (by the\nscriptures) protect the sadhaka=\r\n for a considerable period, they deserve to\nbe appropriately observed, but =\r\nif they (become obstacles along the path) of\nSelf enquiry then give them up=\r\n as deficient. (791)\n\nThere is no fortune greater than (stillness of mind) =\r\npeace, there is no\nforce greater than peace; there is no excellent tapas gr=\r\neater than peace;\nthere is no immortal life greater than (living in) peace.=\r\n (796)\n\nFor those who have abandoned their ego-mind what other things besid=\r\nes that\nare left that are worthy of being renounced. (837)\n\nArunachala is a=\r\n scared place worthy of being adored by Sivayognis. Know it\nto be the heart=\r\n of the earth, attractive and thrilling to Siva.
