You are lucky to have spent time\nwith Manish in the blessed city=\r\n of Kashi and that too at the blessed\nManikarnika ghat.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; There is so=\r\nmething about Manish and dogs. Even when we two were doing\na Chandi homam a=\r\ntop a hill in Kurukshetra in May 2008, a similar thing\nhappened. A pack of =\r\n7-8 dogs living on that hill came and sat around the\nhomam to watch. They w=\r\nere calm for the entire homam (a couple of hours)\nand watched it. When bali=\r\n (we used raisins, i.e. kismis) was offered at\nthe end, they all got up tog=\r\nether and ran in one direction barking and\njumping up. It was as though the=\r\ny were trying to chase someone.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Some say that several animals, espe=\r\ncially dogs, have subtle\nextra-sensory perception that is superior to that =\r\nof humans.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=\r\n=C2  *\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; That homam is still fresh in my mind. When we were climbing =\r\nthat hill\nin the afternoon to do some shooting, Manish told me, &quot;we have a =\r\nstrong\nconnection with this place. Something will happen here today.&quot; When =\r\nwe\ndiscovered two Nath path sadhus following Gorakhnath (Gorakshanath)\nlivi=\r\nng there, we talked to them for a while. Manish saw their homa\nkundam there=\r\n and asked, &quot;we do a Chandi homam everyday. Can we do it in\nyour homa kunda=\r\nm tonight?&quot; The person said, &quot;we are worshippers of\nNarayana and do not wan=\r\nt any taamasik deities to be called or any\ntaamasik practices resorted to.&quot;=\r\n We told him we would call Mahalakshmi\nin fire and there would be no taamas=\r\nik practices. Then he consented.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; We left and reached the hill with =\r\nmaterials around 8:30 pm. The hill\nand its surroundings were pitch dark and=\r\n silent. There was no\nelectricity in that area. We climbed the hill using M=\r\nanish&#39;s cell phone\nbacklight to show the way. There were several dogs there=\r\n and they\nstarted barking when they saw us climbing. But when we started th=\r\ne\nhomam, dogs stopped barking and sat around the fire calmly. An old sadhu\n=\r\nalso came out of the hut and sat near the fire.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; The moment The Moth=\r\ner was invoked in fire, the whole place that was\nsilent till then except fo=\r\nr our chants suddenly came alive with all\nkinds of sounds. There was a vall=\r\ney in the eastern direction. A lot of\nbirds suddenly rose up from their tre=\r\nes in that area and started making\nloud sounds. The whole area resounded wi=\r\nth the sounds of birds, beetles\netc. Given the silence till then, this huge=\r\n commotion felt quite eerie.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2=\r\n =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; While on the topic of that trip, I can ment=\r\nion something personal that\ndemonstrates how pride keeps coming back, as ta=\r\nught by Ramakrishna in\nthe story sent by Prasanth today.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; During tha=\r\nt trip in the Indian summer of 2008, Manish kept on feeding\nmy ego. He prai=\r\nsed me to the skies in front of several people. When a\nlady saint in the li=\r\nneage of Upasani Maharaj was talking about Upasani\nMaharaj, Manish would br=\r\ning me into the topic and mention great things\nabout me. As he kept praisin=\r\ng me in front of people, I was first\nunaffected. But it slowly got to my he=\r\nad. I started to feel special.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; On the night of that homam atop a hi=\r\nll in Kurukshetra, Manish relaxed\nhis rule of not allowing another person t=\r\no put aahutis in fire when\ndoing homam. Though the plan was that I would do=\r\n homam in my homa kundam\nand Manish would do in their homa kundam, he chang=\r\ned his mind at the\nlast minute and said we would do together in the same ho=\r\nma kundam. He\nsaid I was ready and could share homam with him. I was ecstat=\r\nic and saw\nit as an &quot;acknowledgment&quot; of my &quot;spiritual progress&quot;. My already=\r\n\nprovoked pride peaked with this.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; My mind was filled with proud tho=\r\nughts and my focus on mantra and\ndeity was weak, as we chanted Saptashati d=\r\nuring that night&#39;s homam.\nManish said nothing there. The moment homam was o=\r\nver and we went back,\nhe scolded me with a very stern and serious tone, &quot;wh=\r\nat were you\nthinking? We called the Mother in fire and you were so distract=\r\ned. You\nwasted a great opportunity tonight. We are chootiyas (an expletive)=\r\n and\nShe is the Mother of the universe. How can you absorb your mind in\nego=\r\nistic thoughts in her presence? Had I been strict like my gurus or\nlike the=\r\n gurus of the old times, you would&#39;ve been killed today.&quot; He was\nin that se=\r\nrious mood for an hour or so and then became very kind and\ncompassionate ag=\r\nain. He laughed, &quot;are you still thinking about it? Leave\nit Narasimha. Thes=\r\ne things happen. Everything happens for good. I have\nno doubt you will over=\r\ncome. Time has to come for anything. Don&#39;t worry\nand keep doing sadhana.&quot;\n&gt;=\r\n =C2\n&gt; I realized that day that Mahaamaayaa is very powerful. Irrespective =\r\nof\nwhat you experience and irrespective of how much progress you make, she\n=\r\ncan delude you in a split second. In fact, the experiences one has and\nthe =\r\nprogress one makes is not really one&#39;s. She gives them and she uses\nthem to=\r\n bind one. The moment one thinks &quot;I, so-and-so individual, exist&quot;\nand attri=\r\nbutes those &quot;experiences&quot; and &quot;progress&quot; to that &quot;I&quot;, one is\ninstantly boun=\r\nd - there is scope for pride, happiness, unhappiness etc\nand one can be del=\r\nuded. Constant surrender to the supreme power running\nthe universe, while p=\r\nerforming the duties that one is inspired to\nperform using the body inhabit=\r\ned by one and without paying ANY attention\nto ANY results that come, includ=\r\ning praises and criticism, is the only\nsolution.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; This experience ta=\r\nught me a very valuable lesson. What Manish said\nabout me to others in my p=\r\nresence may have been a way of testing me. It\nis also possible that it is c=\r\norrect. In either case, it does not matter.\nThe persona (body-name-entity) =\r\none inhabits on earth is a *temporary*\nabode allocated to one for fulfillin=\r\ng one&#39;s dharma. Attributes of that\npersona, including its merits and demeri=\r\nts, are irrelevant to one. The\nmoment one looks at that persona as &quot;I&quot; and =\r\nforms an attachment to the\nattributes of that persona, one gets bound. Inst=\r\nead, one should just use\nthat persona to fulfill dharma without forming an =\r\nattachment. An\nattachment to a persona brings many happinesses and many mis=\r\neries and\nbinds one, irrespective of how meritorious that persona is. At th=\r\ne end\nof the day, everything that is temporary perishes.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Also, note=\r\n that pride can strike anytime anywhere, as long as one has\nan attachment t=\r\no the persona. Keep doing sadhana, while constantly\ncontemplating and guard=\r\ning against such an attachment. Pride is\nsuppressed for a while, comes back=\r\n again, is suppressed again, comes\nback again and so on. This cycle goes on=\r\n until one&#39;s attachment to the\npersona is killed completely. This is a long=\r\n process. Don&#39;t worry too\nmuch and just keep doing sadhana.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; *=C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; The thing =\r\nabout the hungry kid reminds me of something. When Manish\nand I were climbi=\r\nng down at Girnar around sunset, a lame dog that was\nwalking on 3 legs star=\r\nted following us. It came with us a long way. At\none point, it ran ahead of=\r\n us and sat in front of a roadside (or rather\nstair-side) stall that was st=\r\nill open. Manish stopped there, bought some\nbiscuit packets and fed some to=\r\n the dog. That dog stopped following us\nthen. In a couple of minutes, we en=\r\ncountered an old man in shoddy\nclothes. He was weeping. Manish stopped and =\r\nasked him what happened. He\nsaid he lost all his money at a hotel in Junaga=\r\ndh and has no money to\neven buy food. He decided to just climb the hill (it=\r\n has 7,000 stairs!)\nand go to Dattatreya and leave it to him to help him ou=\r\nt. He was\nclimbing up, while we were climbing down. It was getting nearly d=\r\nark\nthen. Manish gave him a lot of money, all the biscuit packets that were=\r\n\nwith us and a soft drink. He thanked and gave back a few\n&gt; biscuit pieces =\r\nto me and said, &quot;you guys keep this.&quot;\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Later Manish told me the same=\r\n thing he told you, &quot;you never know when\nand in what form god comes to test=\r\n you. Kindness and compassion towards\nneedy people is an important dharma.&quot;=\r\n\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; One does not need to do something beyond one&#39;s means. But, one can=\r\n\nhave compassion, feel the other person&#39;s pain and help within one&#39;s\nmeans.=\r\n\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; I considered the biscuit pieces given back by that old man as\nDatt=\r\natreya&#39;s prasad and ate it. Regarding the child you saw, please note\nthat V=\r\natuka Bhairava is depicted as a child.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2=\r\n  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2  *\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; BTW, the Girnar trip happenened u=\r\nnplanned. We were supposed to be in\nDwaraka for one more day shooting for t=\r\nhe Krishna movie. But we\nbasically finished what we had intended. So I was =\r\nthinking in my mind\nwith dissatisfaction, &quot;why does Manish want to prolong =\r\nthings here and\nshoot more? We are done here. Why can&#39;t we just leave Dwara=\r\nka and\nperhaps go to Girnar for a day?&quot; I kept my thoughts to myself. It wa=\r\ns\nlate in the evening and we were on our way to a Shiva temple at Dwaraka.\n=\r\nAll of a sudden, Manish told the driver to stop and turn back to the\nhotel.=\r\n He announced that we were leaving for Girnar. He said, &quot;bulawa aa\ngaya. hu=\r\nm Girnar jaayenge&quot; (invitation has arrived. We will go to\nGirnar.) We rushe=\r\nd to the hotel, packed and left in 10 minutes. We\nreached Girnar around mid=\r\nnight and spent the next day there. For those\nwho do not know, Girnar is co=\r\nnsidered the abode of Lord Dattatreya.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Sometimes, Manish has the un=\r\ncanny ability to respond to one&#39;s\nthoughts. However, he says it is not his =\r\nability, but it is Nature\nlistening to one&#39;s wish and fulfilling through an=\r\nother.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n=C2  =\r\n*\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Imagine chess pieces being moved by an expert player thinking &quot;I =\r\nam an\npowerful king. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am a beautiful queen. I am great&quot;, &quot;I =\r\nam\na strong knight. I am great&quot;, &quot;I killed a great bishop despite being a\np=\r\nawn. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am just a pawn, but I sacrificed myself to trap\nthe qu=\r\neen. I am great&quot; etc.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; It may sound weird, but this is what happens =\r\nin real life all the\ntime. You, I, all these people are pieces in another k=\r\nind of chess game.\nNot realizing that a player is moving us, we engage in e=\r\ngoistic\nthoughts, fake happiness, fake sadness, fake pride, fake shame etc.=\r\n One\nis free from all those fake feelings if one realizes this.

I see\nt=\r\nhat your signature changed after the trip.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; We had a remarkable time=\r\n at Varanasi.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; The moment our flight landed at the Kashi airport whi=\r\nch is actually\nquite outside the main city of Kashi, Manish said there is s=\r\nomething in\nhere which is different. The energy is palpable throughout. Aft=\r\ner\nchecking in at the hotel we spend the time in roaming around the ghats,\n=\r\nwatching the evening Ganga Arati and shooting.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; By 9 PM Manish decid=\r\ned on doing a Chandi homa, at the famous\nManikarnika samshan, on a funeral =\r\npyre. Sadhana in a samshan bhoomi is\nsomething that many great sadhakas in =\r\nHinduism have done before.\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa used to perform various =\r\nsadhanas in a\nsamshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a great siddha -=C2 spent most o=\r\nf his days\nnear the Manikarnik Samshan doing sadhana.=C2 The effect that a =\r\nSamshan\nhas on the human consciousness can be apty used, for those who have=\r\n such\ninclination, to further ones spiritual growth. The fire of a funeral\n=\r\npyre is called kravyada agni, an impure form of fire unlike the fire of\na s=\r\ntandard homa agni. However, there have been sadhakas, and many in\nnumber, w=\r\nho has used the samshan agni to perform homas. They chose not\nto make a dis=\r\ntinction between pure and impure.If someone feels that a\nfuneral pyre is &quot;u=\r\nnholy&quot;, he or she would be better off not trying\nanything in such a fire. T=\r\nhe main deities of a samshan bhoomi are\nMahakala and\n&gt; Mahakali.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; =\r\n=C2 We went to buy some samagri - til (black and white), couple\nof=C2 full =\r\ncoconuts, flowers, incense stick (agabatti), =C2 kismis,\nhavan samagri. Whi=\r\nle buying the samagri from a shop inside a lane near\nthe Vishwanath temple,=\r\n suddenly a small begger child came and kept\nasking for food. There was a s=\r\nweet shop on the other side of the lane,\nhe pointed to the shop asking for =\r\nfood. Manish turned around, bought\nsome food and gave it to the child. The =\r\nchild was eating when we turned\nback towards the shop from where we were bu=\r\nying the samagri. In a moment\nManish asked me to check for the child, I tur=\r\nned round and found no one\nthere. I looked in the lane and there was no chi=\r\nld anywhere. Just gone,\nvanished! I still remember the child very clearly. =\r\nManish smiled and\nsaid, &quot; The deity of this place wanted to see whether we=\r\n=C2 had become\nso big sadhakas that we=C2 are unable to feed a hungry child=\r\n=C2 . That\nis how God comes to test people.=C2 Kya pata Narayan kab, kaha a=\r\nur=C2\nkis\n&gt; roop me mil jaye.&quot;\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; At 11 pm we left for Manikarnik, dre=\r\nssed in a combination of red and\nblack. Walking along the ghats we reached =\r\nthe samshan at around eleven\nthirty. It was quite crowded, with=C2 domes (p=\r\neople who work there to\nhelp the bodies burn) and the relatives. There were=\r\n at least 8 to 10\npyres burning simultaneously. Right next to it was the Ga=\r\nnges, pitch\nblack at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting for the crowd to ea=\r\nse out a\nbit, not sure when that will happen, not sure=C2 how people are go=\r\ning\nto react. As we sat observing, the people too were observing us with a\n=\r\nmix of curiosity=C2 and possible=C2 apprehension.=C2 Suddenly Manish\nclosed=\r\n his eyes and meditated some time, then remarked that this place\nhas a trem=\r\nendous energy. Something of almost infinite abilities resides\nin this samsh=\r\nan bhoomi. A deity. While sayingf so he turned behind to\nlook at something,=\r\n I too turned. I could see nothing but blank space.\nBut that very instant t=\r\nhe dogs in the samshan went running=C2 to\n&gt; that direction.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; After w=\r\naiting like this for about an hour, we found a pyre where the\nrelatives had=\r\n left.The major portion had been burnt already, but there\nwas enough left t=\r\no last for some time still. We went and sat next to it.\nManish started the =\r\nhoma. The offering was of til. I sat next to him\ndoing the Chandi path, try=\r\ning to be in sync with his recital. A part of\nmy mind was also trying to ad=\r\njust itself to the ambience. There were\nquite a few people around watching =\r\nwhat we were upto. But no one\ndisturbed. The dome had to come and take wood=\r\n from the pyre to light\nother pyres. He did it in the most cautious manner =\r\npossible, taking\npieces from the fringe of the pyre. After some time Manish=\r\n indicated to\nhim not to take any more wood. The dome nodded his head and d=\r\nid not\ndisturb that pyre again.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Very soon, within half an hour I no=\r\nticed that a pack of 4/5 dogs had\ncome and were sitting around the pyre on =\r\nwhich the homa was being done.\nAs=C2 I=C2 read the Chandi I felt a great pr=\r\nessure on my head, from\nall sides. As if a something was pressing hard on m=\r\ny skull, gripping it\ntight. The concentration become excellent. I soon forg=\r\not who was\nwatching us or anything else around me, except for the sound of =\r\nthe\nChandi Path. Very nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it=\r\n\nwas a piece of iron and there=C2 was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just\nke=\r\npt pulling the mind away to some distant place, far, far away from the\nreal=\r\nity I am normally=C2 accustomed to.=C2 While the homa was on,\nsuddenly=C2 o=\r\nne black dog from the pack which was sitting nearby, sat\nup on two legs and=\r\n kept starting at Manish. For I think about 10 mins it\nkept staring with it=\r\n&#39;s head pointed in an angular fashion. Its eyes and\nmannerism gave a feelin=\r\ng as if it is not an animal but a human being\n&gt; watching. Just staring and =\r\nobserving every action. Manish said Kala\nBhairava had entered into the body=\r\n of that dog.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; The homa finished at around 3 AM. The meditations bot=\r\nh at the end as\nwell as in between, were all excellent. The mind would just=\r\n get pulled a\nfew notches above the ordinary with slightest bit of effort.\n=\r\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Simply being in a samshan and observing the human body burning up h=\r\nas\na powerful effect on the mind. In a nearby pyre we saw the femur bones\no=\r\nf a female human body burning. Both the femurs were visible and spread\napar=\r\nt. In an ordinary setting, this kind of a scene would mean a woman\nwith &quot;le=\r\ngs spread apart&quot; which has a very sexual connotation. In\nManikarnik, on tha=\r\nt night, it only evoked a feeling of how eventually\nthe body is merely a co=\r\nvering for something far more real and powerful\nthat resides inside. The sk=\r\nin, flesh, bones etc will perish as they are\nment to perish. Only Rama naam=\r\n satya hai.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Manish said if your intentions of going to a samshan bh=\r\noomi is merely\nto please God through sadhanas=C2 - i.e you are not planning=\r\n something\nnegative nor desirous of petty mundane gains - there is very lit=\r\ntle\nchance that you will ever come to harm. Further, when you do a Chandi\nh=\r\noma, no ethereal beings will disturb you because no one wants to mess\nwith=\r\n=C2 someone who is worshipping Chandi. It is not difficult, neither\nsomethi=\r\nng to be unnecessarily scared of. There are spirits etc for sure,\nbut neith=\r\ner will you bother them nor will they bother you. =C2\nSurrendering to the d=\r\neity is very good=C2 attitude to have. And\nfinally, the soul of the individ=\r\nual on whose pyre the homa is being\ndone, is taken by the Goddess and acqui=\r\nres a lot of punya.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Thus ended my first experience of a Chandi homa=\r\n on a burning pyre.That\nnight was Krishna Saptami. The next two nights agai=\r\nn we did homas at\nManikarnik.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2 Rajarshi\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; ...to=\r\n be continued...\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Rama Naama Satya Hai..\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
