The idea is that one is not bound by Maayaa once one *fully* under=\r\nstands \n&gt; and appreciates it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Chandipath consists of symbolic stories=\r\n of wars \n&gt; that the divine Mother fought, which explain how one can fight =\r\nand overcome \n&gt; various weaknesses that typically bind one in Maayaa. Recit=\r\ning these stories on \n&gt; a regular basis will promote the fighting spirit wi=\r\nthin one that fights these \n&gt; weaknesses.\n&gt;  \n&gt; There is nothing wrong in u=\r\nnderstanding Maayaa and \n&gt; trying to fight/overcome it at the same time. On=\r\ne aspect of the Mother creates \n&gt; Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes yo=\r\nu experience good and bad in that \n&gt; Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes=\r\n you understand Maayaa to overcome it. One \n&gt; aspect of the Mother makes yo=\r\nu fight and overcome it. When one realizes Self at \n&gt; the end, irrespective=\r\n of the path taken, one finally sees that all these are \n&gt; aspects of a Sin=\r\ngle Mother who is also essentially true Self.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        \n&gt; *        *\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Also, I have started to read the Aghora series \n&gt; books by Dr. Robe=\r\nrt\n&gt; &gt; Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings \n&gt; on the subject.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nPerhaps I need to read more! \n&gt;  \n&gt; Aghora series books by Svoboda are good=\r\n, but Aghora \n&gt; is not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed fe=\r\nelings.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. \n&gt; One of =\r\nthe names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true Aghora (aghori) does not \n&gt; see a=\r\nnything as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent \n&gt; manifes=\r\ntations of god and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is \n&gt; pe=\r\nrmanent (god) always, instead of impermanent manifestations of \n&gt; god.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; When someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam \n&gt; satya hai&quot; while ca=\r\nrrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name \n&gt; of Lord Ram=\r\na is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind \n&gt; one=\r\nself that life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is=\r\n \n&gt; real. But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultim=\r\nate truth \n&gt; only when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposed=\r\nly great thing we \n&gt; have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, ca=\r\nn&#39;t we tell ourselves \n&gt; &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the p=\r\nraises are temporary \n&gt; illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not =\r\ndwell on temporary \n&gt; illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beaut=\r\niful and want to get it, \n&gt; can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. =\r\nThis thing that seems beautiful \n&gt; and other things that seem not so beauti=\r\nful are temporary illusions. Only the \n&gt; Lord is real. Let the mind not dwe=\r\nll on temporary illusions&quot;? When someone \n&gt; attacks and abuses us and we ar=\r\ne about to feel sad or angry, can&#39;t we tell \n&gt; ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya =\r\nhai. These abuses are temporary illusions. Only the \n&gt; Lord is real. Let th=\r\ne mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind think=\r\ns &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; \n&gt; always. His mind rejects all *impermanent manif=\r\nestations* of Lord (instead of \n&gt; *dwelling* on them by classifying them as=\r\n pure and impure, good and bad etc and \n&gt; thinking about them with attracti=\r\non/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on \n&gt; what is permanent. But he t=\r\nakes it to extremes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        \n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Vedanta says &quot;all i=\r\ns Self. The variety we perceive \n&gt; is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it pr=\r\nactically. If feces and fruit are both \n&gt; impermenant illusions and the onl=\r\ny permanent reality within them is the Self, he \n&gt; questions why he can eat=\r\n fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces \n&gt; is eaten. But, =\r\nplease remember that eating \n&gt; feces is not the main point. Perceiving Self=\r\n in the food being consumed and not \n&gt; perceiving an impermanent manifestat=\r\nion of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main \n&gt; point. For example, eating f=\r\neces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a \n&gt; person&#39;s mind is dwellin=\r\ng on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) \n&gt; while eating it. A =\r\nsuccessful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not \n&gt; be dwelling=\r\n on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and \n&gt; will =\r\nnot feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and he is=\r\n \n&gt; eating Self.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions \n&gt; r=\r\neally. He chants vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I a=\r\nm \n&gt; Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely =\r\nbe a \n&gt; ritual and not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his=\r\n mind may \n&gt; dwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty ladd=\r\nu&quot;, &quot;a badly \n&gt; cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and wa=\r\nver from the focus on \n&gt; the permanent (Self).\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thus, a vedantin and a=\r\nn aghora are telling \n&gt; themselves the same truth and trying to absorb that=\r\n truth into every thought and \n&gt; impulse. But aghora is putting himself in =\r\nan extreme situation where failure \n&gt; results in a very bad dual experience=\r\n. That can in fact work as an incentive in \n&gt; forcing one to transcend dual=\r\nity! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic \n&gt; verse that says &quot;I am Se=\r\nlf and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and \n&gt; nicely made food, =\r\nthe fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while \n&gt; eating is not =\r\ntoo bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) \n&gt; taste of a=\r\n laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the \n&gt; mi=\r\nnd fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so =\r\n\n&gt; disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual exper=\r\nience \n&gt; may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, diff=\r\nicult tasks cannot necessarily be \n&gt; accomplished by everyone merely becaus=\r\ne of an incentive. Not everyone trying \n&gt; Aghora sadhanas succeeds.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *=\r\n        \n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someone is=\r\n doing a lot of sadhana, \n&gt; like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness=\r\n for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is \n&gt; dwelling on sex or getting sexual though=\r\nts in the middle of sadhana and that is \n&gt; causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s=\r\n sadhana.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the =\r\nmind away from \n&gt; sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming=\r\n such thoughts. After \n&gt; all, such thoughts may still come and distract one=\r\n. Even if one keeps celibacy \n&gt; for 10 years, there is no guarantee that th=\r\ne fascination in the mind does not \n&gt; return to bite one after that. But, h=\r\now to overcome the fascination some minds \n&gt; may have for sex?\n&gt;  \n&gt; An agh=\r\nora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and \n&gt; re=\r\nmove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two \n=\r\n&gt; different activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combine them=\r\n into \n&gt; one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora=\r\n sits naked \n&gt; with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his =\r\njapam. In the \n&gt; beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may th=\r\nink that his sadhana \n&gt; is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to d=\r\no japam like that for several \n&gt; months/years. Eventually, mind may be repr=\r\nogrammed. He may no longer feel that \n&gt; he is doing something impure. He ma=\r\ny no longer feel titillation. The association \n&gt; in his mind between nakedn=\r\ness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures \n&gt; physically or ment=\r\nally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts \n&gt; of meditati=\r\non. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head \n&gt; may=\r\n not lead to denser and denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in =\r\n\n&gt; sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spendi=\r\nng so \n&gt; much time in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attrac=\r\ntion and \n&gt; thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken do=\r\nwn. Overall, the \n&gt; person&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may be gone l=\r\nargely.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and=\r\n the thoughts \n&gt; we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down so=\r\nme of these structures \n&gt; by engaging in certain practices that undermine t=\r\nhose structures.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It=\r\n is also possible that \n&gt; the person keeps on engaging in the practice mere=\r\nly for sex and thinks of sex \n&gt; everytime he sits for meditation (instead o=\r\nf thinking of meditation everytime he \n&gt; sees naked partner), if one was no=\r\nt serious/sincere/ ready to start with.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        \n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  Bot=\r\ntomline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head \n&gt; on and sets=\r\n up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may push \n&gt; the =\r\nproblems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risk=\r\ny \n&gt; strategy is not applicable to all.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        \n&gt; *        *\n&gt;  Lik=\r\ne Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and what \n&gt; is Aghora&quot;? A=\r\nghora is merely a practical way to understand and absorb Vedanta in \n&gt; one&#39;=\r\ns thought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan. However, it is \n&gt; =\r\ncertainly not suitable for all and many may feel aversion. More dangerously=\r\n, \n&gt; some people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong understanding =\r\nand the \n&gt; thrill such an understanding brings. Aghora stands for neither t=\r\nhrills nor \n&gt; perversion, though it *may* attract some people pursuing thri=\r\nlls and/or \n&gt; perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads=\r\n are the same, but \n&gt; Aghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the truth=\r\n into one&#39;s thinking by \n&gt; making failure very unpleasant.\n&gt;  \n&gt; BTW, the f=\r\nollowing mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths \n&gt; and expla=\r\nins the basic reality.

But what=\r\n I am trying to understand is that \n&gt; &gt;        how to worship both forms si=\r\nmultaneously. For instance, Sri \n&gt; &gt;        Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a =\r\ngreat composer (one of the Divine Trinity \n&gt; &gt;        of Carnatic Music alo=\r\nng with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who was a \n&gt; &gt;        self-realized =\r\nSri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna \n&gt; &gt;        Krithis mention great =\r\ndetails about all the nine avaranas \n&gt; &gt;        and different forms of the =\r\ndivine mother as one goes through each \n&gt; &gt;        avarana. In the Dhyana K=\r\nrithi of those, in the very first \n&gt; &gt;        line he says, &#39;Kamalambike, A=\r\nsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;. That line \n&gt; &gt;        tells me that even throu=\r\ngh Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in \n&gt; &gt;        that form. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\nSo my question was in that perspective. Anyway, your reply was a \n&gt; &gt;      =\r\n  great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by layers of =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;        duality! I never thought in those terms. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;I have starte=\r\nd reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of \n&gt; &gt;        reading it =\r\nfluently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I plan to \n&gt; &gt;        do=\r\n during navaratri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get comfortable \n&gt; &gt;    =\r\n    reading the saptashati! Have to see how mother will help me achieve my =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;        target. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;Also, I have started to read the Aghora series=\r\n books by Dr. Robert \n&gt; &gt;        Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelin=\r\ngs on the subject. Perhaps I \n&gt; &gt;        need to read more! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;Nagraj=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;--- On Fri, 2/12/10, \n&gt; &gt;        Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. ne=\r\nt&gt; &gt;        wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;From: Narasimha PVR Rao \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          &lt;pvr@=\r\ncharter. net&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          Homam a=\r\nnd Sri Vidya\n&gt; &gt;&gt;To: \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Date=\r\n: Friday, February 12, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          2010, 11:31 PM\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;  \n&gt; &gt;&gt;N=\r\namaste,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Sanskrit is almost like a mother tongue to me. My \n&gt; &gt;&gt;   =\r\n       performing a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspiring. O=\r\nn \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          the other hand, there are some people who do not know Sans=\r\nkrit at all \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great d=\r\nifficulty in their \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          first attempt. THEY are doing Chandi homa=\r\nm everyday and it takes them \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-insp=\r\niring.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Integrating various \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          sadhanas is a personal p=\r\nroblem that needs a personal solution. In \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          general, it is a g=\r\nood idea to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          the time s=\r\npent on them, instead of splitting the time between ten \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          thin=\r\ngs. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres \n&gt; &gt;&gt;   =\r\n       in one place rather than dig one metre in ten places, if one wants t=\r\no \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          find water.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;One possibility is to do a homam and =\r\nthen meditate \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          at the end after poornaahuti with various mant=\r\nras one is attached \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          to.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;I am not that knowledgeable=\r\n about Sri Vidya. However, from \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          the little I have been expos=\r\ned to, Sree chakra is a symblic \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          representation of the layers=\r\n of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          too, is to unrave=\r\nl the layer of duality and realize \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          Self.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Lalita mea=\r\nns gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          If you have a=\r\n mother who teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          yo=\r\nu have a mother who is stern and strict, you will learn fast \n&gt; &gt;&gt;         =\r\n (provided you can face the strictness).

You also wrote that \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          =\r\nit takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How \n&gt; &gt;&gt;  =\r\n        can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;          Also, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;          minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a sho=\r\nrt rudra \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5=\r\n-10 minutes) \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual=\r\n. Plus I sometimes do \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          special rituals several times a week, =\r\nthat takes about 1 to 1.5 hours \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          in all. How to integrate the=\r\nse along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          different from Chand=\r\ni homam? Could you please explain what is sri \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          Vidya and how =\r\nit is to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          the De=\r\nvi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in Sri \n&gt; &gt;&gt;      =\r\n    Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;          krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;Nagra=\r\nj \n&gt; &gt;&gt;          Kota\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
