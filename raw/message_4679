NAGARAJAN, a staunch devotee of Bhagavan,comes from Mambattu, a\nv=\r\nillage in the Polur Taluk of the North Arcot District of the state of Tamil=\r\n\nNadu. Even as a young boy he used to accompany his parents when they came =\r\nto\nTiruvannamaIai for the yearly Deepam festival, at which time and on simi=\r\nlar\noccasions, his father, who was a devotee of Bhagavan, used to take him =\r\nto\nthe Ashram. Thus he came to know Bhagavan in his childhood. When he was =\r\nten\nyears old, his friend, who was a nephew of Echammal, spoke to him about=\r\n the\ngreatness of Bhagavan. He and this friend used to practise dhyana and =\r\nyogic\nasanas (sitting postures) every day in the early morning. In the even=\r\ning\nthey meditated on Bhagavan.\n\nSri Nagarajan used to have frequent vision=\r\ns of Bhagavan and Lord Murugan in\nhis dreams. At about this time Ranga Rao,=\r\n an old devotee of Bhagavan, now no\nmore,had set up an ashram at Polur name=\r\nd Indra Ashram, to which other\ndevotees of Bhagavan used to go and talk abo=\r\nut Bhagavan and other spiritual\nmatters. In 1930, when Sri Nagarajan was 15=\r\n years old Ranga Rao brought him\nto Sri Ramanansramam.\n\nHere he was allotte=\r\nd the work of doing puja, and helping in the bookstall\netc. But what he val=\r\nued most was the privilege of cutting up vegetables and\ngrinding the pulses=\r\n and coconut gratings for chutney in the kitchen with\nBhagavan. But most of=\r\n the time he was in the hall attending to some minor\nwork or other. He had =\r\nthus the opportunity of listening to the replies which\nBhagavan gave to the=\r\n questions put to him by visitors and devotees. As a\nresult of this he beca=\r\nme a firm believer in the path of Self-enquiry taught\nby Bhagavan.\n\nAt the =\r\nend of six months Sri Nagarajan went home but soon returned and\nstayed on f=\r\nor four years. Jobs were offered to him but he was not interested\nin them s=\r\nince the acceptance of a job would mean parting from Bhagavan. But\none day =\r\na letter came from his mother informing him that a job had been\nfound for h=\r\nim. This letter came to the hands of Bhagavan along with the\nAshram post. A=\r\nfter reading it Bhagavan said,=E2=80=9CLook here, a job has been found\nfor =\r\nyou. Go and accept it immediately.=E2=80=9DTears came into the eyes of Sri\n=\r\nNagarajan at the thought of parting from Bhagavan. But Bhagavan said again,=\r\n\n=E2=80=9CYou can go on Wednesday and join duty on Thursday.=E2=80=9D Unwil=\r\nlingly he left the\nAshram. Thereafter he came to the Ashram as often as he =\r\ncould get leave.\n\nWhile Sri Nagarajan was employed at Sattur from 1955 to 1=\r\n958 he organised a\nRamana Mandali where Bhagavan=E2=80=99s songs like The M=\r\narital Garland of Letters\nwere sung and devotees meditated every day. Talks=\r\n were given periodically at\nthis Mandali =E2=80=94 Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Jayan=\r\nti and Aradhana were also celebrated in a\nfitting manner. Sri Nagarajan als=\r\no established a school named Sri Ramana\nVidya Mandiram Elementary School at=\r\n Sattur in memory of Bhagavan.\n\nAfter holding several important posts in th=\r\ne firm of Burmah Shell, Sri\nNagarajan has now retired. Since then he has li=\r\nved for some time in Tambaram\nand later joined the Ashram to render his ser=\r\nvice.\n\nSources:\n\n1) The Silent Power Selections from The Mountain Path and =\r\nThe Call Divine\n2) http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ramana_maharshi/books/sp/sp04=\r\n2.html\n3) Arunachala&#39;s Ramana Volume II Book\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0015175ce1302ec1b0048bb84c17\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;SRI M.S.
