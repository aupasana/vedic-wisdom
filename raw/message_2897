It just took slightly more than 10 min=\r\n to do the same, but, I have lot of questions:\n\nThe restrictions to do pitr=\r\ni tarpanam:\nSunday that has saptami tithi\nFriday that has a nanda tithi (1s=\r\nt, 6th and 11th tithis)\nSunday with Moon in Bharani, Krittika and Magha\none=\r\n&#39;s birth day\n\nDo we have any explanation as to why?\n\nAlso, if on a Sunday h=\r\nas Saptami till 10:13 am, can we do pitri tarpanam after 10:13 am (i.e. aft=\r\ner Saptami is over)?\nSimilarly, if Sunday has sashti till 16:30, can we do =\r\npitri tarpanam before 16:30?\n\nDoes nanda tithi has any relavance to the pak=\r\nsha? (Pratipat in both kshaya and Sukla paksha is nanda tithi. Right?)\n\nFor=\r\n verifyinng Sunday with Moon in Bharani, we should consider the time at whi=\r\nch you are doing tarpanam and not the whole day. Right?\n\nWhat is the defini=\r\ntion of birthday? (sorry for silly question).\nI am born on a Bhadrapada Suk=\r\nla ekadasi in Uttarashada on a Thurday.\n- Should I avoid pitri tarpanam on =\r\nany Thursday?\n- Should I avoid pitri tarpanam on any sukla ekadasi?\n- Shoul=\r\nd I avoid pitri tarpanam when moon is in Uttarashada?\n- Should I avoid pitr=\r\ni tarpanam on nija bhadrapada month sukla ekadasi?\n- Should I avoid pitri t=\r\narpanam in nija bhadrapada month when moon is in Uttarashada?\n\nI see deva a=\r\nnd rishi tarpanam water is left from fingures (position 1 in picture). pitr=\r\ni tarpanam water is left from middle of thumb and index finger (position 3 =\r\nin picture). What about position 2 (below little finger)? When do we let wa=\r\nter flow out from it?\n\nPlease note that 3 offerins are made to 3 generation=\r\ns of maternal and paternal ancestors, while only one offering is made to ot=\r\nher people.\n\nWhy? If I offer to others 3 times, any thing wrong?\n\nAlso, nor=\r\nmally, we do not seem to be allowed to do9 tarpanam inside home where peopl=\r\ne may be sleeping. Why is this? If we do only deva and rishi tarpanam, can =\r\nwe do the same inside home with out any restrictions?\n\nIf ancestors are reb=\r\norn or in hell, how can then come to accept our offering?\n\nIf any of the an=\r\ncestors are not satisfied and end of as ghosts, when you invite them, can t=\r\nhey come and occupy either you or some one mentally weak in the family (and=\r\n hence the restrictions on doing tarpanam when some one may be sleeping) an=\r\nd on some specific days (when your mind may be inherantly week?\n\n\n"}}
