I&#39;ve=\r\n \nhardly sent any message for support, even if sometimes i get hert \nwith v=\r\nery harsh comments towards him(Such as Shakti yoga destroying \nJupiters sig=\r\nnificance etc..) because i know that he doesn&#39;t need it \nand to be honest b=\r\necause i consider him my Guru, doesn&#39;t \nallow/validate me to write in suppo=\r\nrt for the issues which i myself \nhas not understood properly. I need to sa=\r\ny one thing here, \nespecially for Astrological writings of his, that I like=\r\n his \napproach of getting basics right. i have felt for some years now \ntha=\r\nt his thinking matches my thinking in many ways though i am also \nnot doubt=\r\nproof w.r.t. him. i mean i have raised my own doubts to him \nwhenever they =\r\narised. even if they meant herting my dear Garu.\n\n***  \nIn my opinion, It i=\r\ns good to laugh at some critical comments which \nalso has the tickling valu=\r\ne. it makes the atmosphere lighter. but i \nmust say that your way of gently=\r\n reminding Mitesh was very accurate \nand agreeable. am sure Mitesh will agr=\r\nee.\n\nhaving said all these, in my opinion, crtical comments are always \nwel=\r\ncome for anybody including Narasimha, when the intentions behind \nare genui=\r\nne and not intended to insult or hert somebody.\n\n***\nNarasimha might object=\r\n to this message but as you know i write what \ni feel like writing.\n\nWarm R=\r\negards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;a_k_r_j&quot; &lt;a_k_r_j@..=\r\n.&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Mitesh,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sure you are not blaming Narasimha =\r\nbut your way of expression \n&gt; clearly shows that you are not familiar with =\r\nhis writings. I had \nthe \n&gt; good fortune of observing him and his writings =\r\nfor over a decade \nnow \n&gt; and I have seen no other person who is as crystal=\r\n clear in his \n&gt; writings and who is as mindful of his responsibilities and=\r\n who is \nas \n&gt; etiquette as Narasimha is. He almost never answers unless he=\r\n feels \n&gt; that what he is going to write is useful not only to the person \n=\r\nwho \n&gt; has asked the query but to many more. All his posts are very \n&gt; thor=\r\nough, informative and I for one believe that not only the \npeople \n&gt; in thi=\r\ns group but also others who will have the good fortune of \n&gt; seeing his pos=\r\nting in the future will benefit immensely from these \n&gt; postings on the net=\r\n. When I look at the development and \n&gt; transformation that he has gone thr=\r\nough in this period, it amazes \nme \n&gt; to no end. Initially he was (of cours=\r\ne still is) a scholar of \nVedic \n&gt; astrology and later is developing in to =\r\na spiritual giant. In all \n&gt; these years, he has unselfishly contributed to=\r\n whatever he takes \nup \n&gt; and made it a point to spread the knowledge all a=\r\nround for the \n&gt; benefit of the humanity in general. \n&gt; \n&gt; I know Narasimha=\r\n will not appreciate this mail as it contains no \n&gt; valuable information fo=\r\nr the seekers and it might sound as though \nI \n&gt; am praising him. My intent=\r\nion is not that, for I believe he has \nrisen \n&gt; above accolade. \n&gt; \n&gt; You c=\r\nan certainly make requests or even oppose/question his \nwritings \n&gt; and can=\r\n extend other opinions that you may have, in a way that \nwill \n&gt; not offend=\r\n the members of the group. Particularly the \nparagraph &quot;We \n&gt; eat=85&quot; is no=\r\nt at all in good taste, although Utpal has taken them \nas \n&gt; hilarious comm=\r\nents, which shows his magnanimity. It clearly shows \n&gt; your lack of underst=\r\nanding of the context and level of Narasimha&#39;s \n&gt; spiritual attainments.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; I have never written in support of anyone so far nor do I have the \n&gt; ha=\r\nbit of participating in the discussions on the various groups. I \n&gt; have be=\r\nen a silent member, as many are, reading the wonderful \n&gt; writings of peopl=\r\ne like Narasimha and trying to learn from them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope I have not offe=\r\nnded you with my comments, I just felt like \n&gt; butting in!

Sp=\r\nirit of attachment and desire controls how you \n&gt; absorb \n&gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Manojava is the swiftly moving, flickering and unstable \n&gt; flame.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirit of wavering (could also be flexibility) controls \nhow \n&gt; =\r\nyou\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; absorb your experiences, when you are offering in that \ntongu=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sulohita is the (copper like) =\r\ndark red color flame. \nSpirit of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; determination and strength contr=\r\nols how you absorb your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiences,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when you are offering=\r\n in that tongue of fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sudhoomra-Varna is the greyi=\r\nsh/purple/ smoke-colored \nfire. \n&gt; &gt; Spirit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confusion (=\r\ncould also be resolution of confusion) controls \n&gt; how \n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nbsorb your experiences, when you are offering in that \ntongue \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sphulingini is the fire with sparks. Spirit o=\r\nf aggression \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; haste\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (could also be a great intuition=\r\n/insight) controls how you \n&gt; &gt; absorb\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your experiences, when you=\r\n are offering in that tongue of \n&gt; fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Vishwaruchi =\r\nis the bright fire. Spirit of focus, knowing, \n&gt; &gt; being \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; bliss controls how you absorb your experiences, when you \nare \n&gt; &gt; &gt; off=\r\nering\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in that tongue of fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As you keep performing homam and a relationship is formed \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you and fire, the external fire in the homa kundam wil=\r\nl \n&gt; reflect \n&gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; internal fire. When your mind is well-fo=\r\ncused and \nblissful, \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will automatically burn b=\r\nright.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The state of your mind will decide how you wil=\r\nl taste the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiences you are going to absorb =\r\nfrom around you. That \nin \n&gt; &gt; turn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decides which tongues (tastin=\r\ng agents) of your internal \nfire \n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; receiving food right now.=\r\n That in turn decides which \ntongues \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; external fi=\r\nre are receiving offerings right now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The external fi=\r\nre is a mirror to your internal state. An \n&gt; adept \n&gt; &gt; &gt; may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be =\r\nable to detect, looking at the fire, which tongues of \nfire \n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; active right now and hence guess the state your mind is in.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, trying to pay too much at=\r\ntention to this \n&gt; &gt; technicality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and becoming over-conscious of =\r\nthe nature of fire is \n&gt; unneeded. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; external can be =\r\nused to manipulate the internal (within \nsome \n&gt; &gt; &gt; limits),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it =\r\ncan become a distraction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Whether internal follows ex=\r\nternal or external follows \n&gt; internal \n&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; invalid question. T=\r\nhe reality is that the two change \ntogether.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Neither is the cause=\r\n and neither is the effect. They just \n&gt; happen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Without thinkiing much, just make offerings in the fire \nwit=\r\nh \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *firm belief* that god is in fire. The rest will happe=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatically. It may take time, but it will happen by \nitself.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ------=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----\n---\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt;  -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \nrologer.org/ \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ gro=\r\nup/vedic- \nwisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.=\r\n \nhome.comcast. \n&gt; &gt; net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websit=\r\ne: http://www.SriJagan \n&gt; &gt; nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ------------ --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- -----\n---\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt;  -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesd=\r\nay, February 11, 2009 8:13 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Agni\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What do the seven &quot;ton=\r\ngues&quot; of Agni mean?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Rajarsh=\r\ni\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Add more =\r\nfriends to your messenger and enjoy!
