On the contrary, bhak=\r\nti has been, by its very inherent nature, a powerful and dynamic social for=\r\nce in the past. Bhakti is an unparalleled motivating force that has induced=\r\n revolutionary and meaningful change. It will also serve as the driving spi=\r\nritual force that will revive and strengthen Dharma well into the 21st Cent=\r\nury. \n\nBhakti can be the only motivational force strong enough to ensure th=\r\ne degree of self-sacrifice necessary to create true leadership. It is not e=\r\nnough to identify yourself as a &quot;Hindu activist&quot; merely because you find Sa=\r\nnatana Dharma interesting, inspiring, a cool culture that shouldn&#39;t disappe=\r\nar, or just because you somehow think it&#39;s your ethnic heritage. Such trivi=\r\nal concerns are not enough to promote effective action. The only way a Hind=\r\nu leader will be truly effective is if he/she has had a direct vision of Go=\r\nd in his/her heart so powerful that they see it as their own personal servi=\r\nce to Bhavagan to teach others how to love Him. Any lesser motivation only =\r\nleads to the invisible chains of ego. Only when we have leaders who are on =\r\nfire with devotion (bhakti) to God will Dharma be saved.\n\nMy message to the=\r\n Hindu community is this: if you want to see an empowered and fearless Hind=\r\nu leadership arise to lead Dharma into the Twenty-First Century, then YOU m=\r\nust become the leaders you seek. And you must do so, not out of a craving f=\r\nor money, fame, or power, but as a devotional offering of your life humbly =\r\nsurrendered at the divine feet of Bhagavan - the Sweet Absolute....&quot;\n\n\nVISI=\r\nT HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS POWERFUL ARTICLE:\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral=\r\n.com/forum/content.php?9-Bhakti-Social-Force\n\n\nPlease forward this informat=\r\nion to all sincere spiritual seekers.
