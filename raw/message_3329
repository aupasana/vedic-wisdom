I do not see a need to reconcil=\r\ne things. If you are interested in the findings of rishis, study eastern ph=\r\nilosophy without carrying the *baggage* of western philosophy.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nBefore taking an issue with th=\r\nis approach, let me answer your specific question.\n=A0\nAhamkara is not the =\r\nhole in the doughnut. Ahamkara is the &quot;space&quot; that fills the entire doughnu=\r\nt, including the hole in the center and the outside. Manas (sensory mind), =\r\nits organs of perception and organs of action, buddhi (logical mind) and pa=\r\nrt of chitta (memory) that is akin to a cache in computer memory is part of=\r\n the outside of doughnut. Part of chitta (memory) that is uncached (stored =\r\nfrom *forgotten* existences) is in the hole in the middle.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\n&gt; The reason is that western-styl=\r\ne inquiry/explanations always\n&gt; originate from sensory observables - which =\r\nare of *common\n&gt; experience to all*, whereas eastern-style inquiry/explanat=\r\nions\n&gt; may originate from sometimes non-sensory observables, which\n&gt; lead t=\r\no many misconceptions/subjective interpretations.\n=A0\nThere are a lot of bl=\r\nind people in the world. Sensory experiences related to vision are unknown =\r\nto them. Can they dismiss explanations originating from vision as &quot;misconce=\r\nptions/subjective interpretations&quot;?\n=A0\nWhy should it be common experience =\r\nto &quot;all&quot;? If some virus invades the world and takes away vision from 99.999=\r\n9% population of the world, will observations made based on vision by the 0=\r\n.0001% people still having vision be a valid basis for objective inquiry/ex=\r\nplanations?\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nNot all=\r\n non-sensory observations are subjective. There is some uniformity in non-s=\r\nensory observations too. Just as two people watching a cloth with their eye=\r\ns may independently say it is &quot;red&quot; in color, similarly two people observin=\r\ng something using non-sensory observation may say the same thing about it.\n=\r\n=A0\nAs a simple example, I know someone who internally &quot;heard&quot; a specific b=\r\neejaakshara when his Kundalini rose to a specific chakra for the first time=\r\n. At that time, he did not know much about Kundalini and chakras. Some mont=\r\nhs later, he bought some books and read them. He was surprised to learn tha=\r\nt that beejaakshara was indeed associated with that chakra in tantra litera=\r\nture. As he did not know all this before the internal experience, it was no=\r\nt a case of pre-conditioned imagination causing an experience/hallucination=\r\n. Without being influenced by any tantra texts, he experienced something sp=\r\necific that was well-captured by pre-existing tantra texts. I know several =\r\nsuch cases.\n=A0\nFrom my own experience and experience of people I trust, I =\r\nknow for sure that truths captured by sUpanishads and tantra texts were *in=\r\ndependently* experienced by several people. I also know that people can exp=\r\nerience and realize those truths even now, even without reading the books a=\r\nnd being conditioned by them.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nFrom my point of view, there is nothing pristine about observa=\r\ntions made with sensory perception. Just as some non-sensory perception can=\r\n be hallucination, similarly some *sensory* perception can also be hallucin=\r\nation!\n=A0\nMore importantly, the truth that can be captured by sensory perc=\r\neption is quite limited. From my experience, I am convinced that the Absolu=\r\nte, a glimpse of which can liberate one from the cycle of happiness and sad=\r\nness, is beyond sensory perception, as declared by rishis in the past.\n=A0\n=\r\nI humbly, and yet firmly, suggest to seekers that a fresh study of eastern =\r\nphilosophy without carrying the *baggage* of western philosophy will be mor=\r\ne productive. More importantly, a direct individual experience is the only =\r\nway to understand things correctly and theoretical studies can only go so f=\r\nar. Study if you must, but do some sadhana and try to overcome the shadripu=\r\ns.

Although it was useful, I feel it didnt really get to the crux of the mat=\r\nter. I have for a while been pondering how to pose the question in the corr=\r\nect way in order to elicit, from you or anyone else, the level of answers t=\r\nhat I would like to see. I&#39;ll make an attempt now, I would ask only that yo=\r\nu read the whole post..\n&gt; \n&gt; First, contrary to what most people on this gr=\r\noup probably believe, I feel it is best to start, in intellectual discussio=\r\nn at least, with the western concept of consciousness. The reason is that w=\r\nestern-style inquiry/explanations always originate from sensory observables=\r\n - which are of *common experience to all*, whereas eastern-style inquiry/e=\r\nxplanations may originate from sometimes non-sensory observables, which lea=\r\nd to many misconceptions/subjective interpretations. So if we are to reach =\r\nan understanding that is to some degree objective, it is best to start from=\r\n some common ground.\n&gt; \n&gt; For this purpose, I&#39;ll take Carl Jung&#39;s definitio=\r\nns as a starting point. What is ego? From his point of view, ego is one&#39;s e=\r\nveryday field of consciousness. What is one conscious of? Things reported b=\r\ny the senses - the material universe. But also feelings and memories, which=\r\n have no material representation - they are not &quot;gathered&quot; by the senses as=\r\n the material world is. What is the feeling of &quot;I&quot;? It is the center of the=\r\n ego, that gives the ego a feeling of oneness. However, this ego is not a s=\r\nolid circle i.e if the inside of the circle is the contents of the consciou=\r\nsness, it is not as if the center is a content of consciousness too! The eg=\r\no is more like a doughnut, with the empty central part being what Jung call=\r\ns, naturally, the unconscious. We all feel whole i.e. my hand is mine, my l=\r\neg is mine, the memory of savoring a mango last night is also mine, but am =\r\nI the hand - no; am I the leg - no; am I the memory - no; I&#39;ll still be I w=\r\nithout them,\n though maybe not a happy I. So all this is consistent with th=\r\ne doughnut model - an invisible I in the center, conscious of the edible pa=\r\nrt of the doughnut.\n&gt; \n&gt; At this point, even the least spiritual of people =\r\nwould be hard pressed to disagree with me. So from my point of view, this i=\r\ns good and common ground i.e. a good point from where to start investigatin=\r\ng vedic definitions. \n&gt; \n&gt; So at this point, I&#39;ll pose my first set of ques=\r\ntions - Where does this doughnut fit vis-a-vis the antahakarana? Is the dou=\r\nghnut inside the manas with the ahamkara at the invisible center? Or is the=\r\n doughnut in the physical body with the entire antahakarana at the invisibl=\r\ne center? Either way, when you raise kundalini/attempt spiritual awakening,=\r\n you are pushing the inside of the doughnut toward the center, right? \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I can get to more questions as and when you reply..\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Sun=\r\ndeep\n\n\r\n--0-1387042501-1261717581=:78860\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Namaste Sundeep,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Western philoso=\r\nphers are good and smart people, but their understanding of the Absolute (B=\r\nrahman) and its Manifestation (Duality) is nowhere near that of Rishis in m=\r\ny view.
