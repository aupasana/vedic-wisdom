K. Kashyap, National\nInstitute of Biologicals, India, and Dr. Pe=\r\nter Underhill of Stanford\nUniversity in California. Their results generally=\r\n contradict the notion\nAryan invasion/migration theory for the origin of In=\r\ndian civilization.\n\nUnderhill concluded &quot;the spatial frequency distribution=\r\ns of both L1\nfrequency and variance levels show a spreading pattern emanati=\r\nng from\nIndia&quot;, referring to a Y chromosome marker. He, however, put severa=\r\nl\ncaveats before interpreting genetic data, including &quot;Y-ancestry may not\na=\r\nlways reflect the ancestry of the rest of the genome&quot;\n\nDr. Kashyap, on the =\r\nother hand, with the most comprehensive set of\ngenetic data was quite empha=\r\ntic in his assertion that there is &quot;no clear\ngenetic evidence for an intrus=\r\nion of Indo-Aryan people into India, [and]\nestablishment of caste system an=\r\nd gene flow.&quot;\n\nMichael Witzel, a Harvard linguist, who is known to lead the=\r\n idea of\nAryan invasion/migration/influx theory in more recent times, conti=\r\nnued\nto question genetic evidence on the basis that it does not provide the=\r\n\ntime resolution to explain events that may have been involved in Aryan\npre=\r\nsence in India.\n\nDr. Kashyap&#39;s reply was that even though the time resoluti=\r\non needs\nfurther work, the fact that there are clear and distinct differenc=\r\nes in\nthe gene pools of Indian population and those of Central Asian and\nEu=\r\nropean groups, the evidence nevertheless negates any Aryan invasion or\nmigr=\r\nation into Indian Subcontinent.\n\nWitzel though refused to present his own d=\r\nata and evidence for his\ntheories despite being invited to do so was nevert=\r\nheless present in the\nconference and raised many questions. Some of his com=\r\nmentaries\nquestioning the credibility of scholars evoked sharp responses fr=\r\nom\nother participants.\n\nRig Veda has been dated to 1,500 BC by those who us=\r\ne linguistics to\nclaim its origin Aryans coming out of Central Asia and Eur=\r\nope.\nArchaeologist B.B.

His reasoni=\r\nng was that an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *Imaginery creation* of some poet can never Inspire & =\r\nattract\n&gt; &gt; &gt; millions of people for thousans of years.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) If M=\r\naharshi Vyaas has written imaginery story of Mahabhaarat to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; satisfy h=\r\nis poetic genious then how come he himself features in\n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; story?=\r\n if let&#39;s consider even that as a possibility but then WHY\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;ll writ=\r\ne another book just on Shri Krishna i.e. Bhaagavata. why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;ll himsel=\r\nf Worship his own &#39;Kaalpanik Paatra&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) If Shri Krishna was ne=\r\nver born, then how come so many Saints of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yesteryears, saw his form.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One can argue that becuase of their intense worship of that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; per=\r\nticular Form, they could see the same form of the supreme\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reality...t=\r\nhe supreme power can take any form for the Bhakta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The solid counter =\r\nargument is that, Paramhamsa Yogananda and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maharshi Aurobindo, it see=\r\nms, never were a Devotee of that form of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shri Krishna, then how come =\r\nin their case, without devotion &\n&gt; &gt; desire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they got to see the form=\r\n of Shri Krushna?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; !....!....!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Any thoughts about th=\r\nis?

K. Kashyap, National Institute of Biologicals, India, an=\r\nd Dr. Peter Underhill of Stanford University in California. Their results g=\r\nenerally contradict the notion Aryan invasion/migration theory for the orig=\r\nin of Indian civilization. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Underhill concluded &quot;the spatial frequen=\r\ncy distributions of both L1 frequency and variance levels show a spreading =\r\npattern emanating from India&quot;, referring to a Y chromosome marker. He, howe=\r\nver, put several caveats before interpreting genetic data, including &quot;Y-anc=\r\nestry may not always reflect the ancestry of the rest of the genome&quot; &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nP&gt;Dr. Kashyap, on the other hand, with the most comprehensive set of geneti=\r\nc data was quite emphatic in his assertion that there is &quot;no clear genetic =\r\nevidence for an intrusion of Indo-Aryan people into India, [and] establishm=\r\nent of caste system and gene flow.&quot; &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Michael Witzel, a Harvard lingu=\r\nist, who is known to lead the idea of Aryan invasion/migration/influx theor=\r\ny in more recent times, continued to question genetic evidence on the basis=\r\n that it does not provide the time resolution to explain events that may ha=\r\nve been involved in Aryan presence in India. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Dr. Kashyap&#39;s reply wa=\r\ns that even though the time resolution needs further work, the fact that th=\r\nere are clear and distinct differences in the gene pools of Indian populati=\r\non and those of Central Asian and European groups, the evidence nevertheles=\r\ns negates any Aryan invasion or migration into Indian Subcontinent. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P=\r\n&gt;Witzel though refused to present his own data and evidence for his theorie=\r\ns despite being invited to do so was nevertheless present in the conference=\r\n and raised many questions. Some of his commentaries questioning the credib=\r\nility of scholars evoked sharp responses from other participants. &lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;R=\r\nig Veda has been dated to 1,500 BC by those who use linguistics to claim it=\r\ns origin Aryans coming out of Central Asia and Europe.

His reasoning was that an &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; *Imaginery creation* of some poet can never Inspire &amp; attrac=\r\nt &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; millions of people for thousans of years.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) If Maharshi Vyaas has written imaginery story o=\r\nf Mahabhaarat to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; satisfy his poetic genious then how com=\r\ne he himself features in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; story? if let=\r\n&#39;s consider even that as a possibility but then WHY &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; he&#39;l=\r\nl write another book just on Shri Krishna i.e. Bhaagavata. why &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; he&#39;ll himself Worship his own &#39;Kaalpanik Paatra&#39;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) If Shri Krishna was never born, then how come so many=\r\n Saints of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; yesteryears, saw his form.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nOne can argue that becuase of their intense worship of that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; perticular Form, they could see the same form of the supreme &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; reality...the supreme power can take any form for the Bhakta.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; The solid counter argument is that, Paramhamsa Yogananda and =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Maharshi Aurobindo, it seems, never were a Devotee of th=\r\nat form of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Shri Krishna, then how come in their case, wi=\r\nthout devotion &amp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; desire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; they got to se=\r\ne the form of Shri Krushna?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; !....!....=\r\n!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Any thoughts about this?
