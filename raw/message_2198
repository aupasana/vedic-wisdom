If one adds balis to 10 devis (Kaatyaayani etc) and 10 bhairavas r=\r\nepresenting the 10 directions, in addition to the standard bali given in al=\r\nl homas, it adds another 5-10 min only.\n \nThus, a very detailed Chandi homa=\r\nm can be performed within 2 hr if one is comfortable with the mantras and p=\r\nrocedure. However, it can take 3-4 hrs even with a very short procedure at =\r\nthe beginning and one has to keep practicing.\n \nAs Narayan said, it first t=\r\nook him 4 hrs and now it is in 1 to 1:15 hr range. Practice makes it smooth=\r\n.\n \nIf one has wood burning with a big fire and if everything thrown there =\r\nautomatically burns, fire management does not take up one&#39;s time. If one ha=\r\ns to actively manage the fire to ensure things burn, that can add upto a 10=\r\n min of overhead.\n \nThanks,\nNarasimha\n \n---- utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@yah=\r\noo.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Narayan,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am extremely surprised to know th=\r\nat one can complete Chandi Homam in 1 hour. please educate me as to how it =\r\nis possible to complete it in such a short time.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ve performed Chandi=\r\n Homam around 12 times.
