He is not saying th=\r\nat a grossly mispronounced mantra will give you specific results, BUT, if t=\r\nhe fear of the 64 things that bind a mantra stops an individual from even t=\r\nrying to do japa, THAT is an even more serious problem. Therefore, his advi=\r\nse was to start doing sadhana in whatever way possible without getting bogg=\r\ned down by technicalities too much.\n=C2=A0\nSo desire is from yajamana, mind=\r\n is of priest and blessings are from pleased devata. Even in great astro tr=\r\neaty like BPHS, sage parAsharA recommended various rituals of various devat=\r\nas for removing bad effects of bad dashas or bad planetary placements. I wo=\r\nnder if mantra and rituals do not count why Narsimhaji is having so many ho=\r\nma manuals. \n=C2=A0\nMantra and rituals surely count, BUT, they by themselve=\r\ns are incapable of producing results UNTILL the individual performing the r=\r\nitual has requisite Shaktih. \n=C2=A0\nI have seen learned priests performing=\r\n elaborate and technically complex (costly too!)=C2=A0rituals which did not=\r\n produce any result. I wonder how many priests in todays time can say with =\r\n100 percent certainty that if he does X ritual, he can gaurantee a Y result=\r\n for a yajamana? I have met people who can do this too, they were not pries=\r\nts, but sadhakas.\n=C2=A0\nMost=C2=A0ordinary priests today have zero capabil=\r\nity of producing results. The ritual is a tool to be used, through which Sh=\r\nakti accumulated by the priest is directed to gain a certain specifc result=\r\n. Without the Shakti elaborate rituals are of no use. They will just not pr=\r\noduce tangible results. And results are the parameter of judgement. \n=C2=A0=\r\n\nShaktih is the result of accumulated sadhana. Like Narasimha said, a ritua=\r\nl is like a gun and the Shaktih is like a bullet. Having the gun is good, b=\r\nut without the bullet it won&#39;t work. These days priests do not do enough sa=\r\ndhana and therefore, they cannot gaurantee any results most of the times. I=\r\nn the light of the above, it is better if people perform their own rituals =\r\nor own sadhana and=C2=A0 sincerely ask the Deity to give the results instea=\r\nd of waiting for a priest to do it, who anyway cannot gaurantee results the=\r\nse days. Religion is a practical art. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nTo consider spi=\r\nritual aspect of it, persons like saint or yogis who do have dharanA like a=\r\n solid rock who always rest in Trans or dhyanavashtA need not require mantr=\r\na or tantra, rituals for creating energy. A mere wish of them can do work. =\r\nNormal people like me; require all earlier six steps of ashtAngyOgA of pata=\r\nnjali like yama, niyama, aAsana, praNAyAm, pratyahAr and dharanA. And these=\r\n all steps are embedded in vedic or tantrik pooja traditions as mantra, tan=\r\ntra, nyas, etc. So for wish to be get full filled by devata many many thing=\r\ns count.=C2=A0=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nYes many things count, but if the count is so h=\r\nigh that it stops one from even attempting, it is hardly of any use then. A=\r\n saint or a yogi does not become a yogi in a single day, but by rigorous an=\r\nd continuous sadhana day in and day out, across lifetimes. Follow whatever =\r\nrules one is comfortable with, and just plunge into sadhana. The results wi=\r\nll manifests on their own. And Nature is ever kind. It guides the ones who =\r\nhave are ready to make the effort with a sincere heart. BUT effort, even if=\r\n flawed, is the key.=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nThere are people who are theoritically kn=\r\nowledgeable about so many rules/technicalities etc of mantra sadhana, such =\r\nthat they themselves never tried anything, and yet there are others who har=\r\ndly know any rules but just plunge into sadhana and in due coarse=C2=A0of t=\r\nime=C2=A0start experiencing the beauty of the Deity! So therefore, all said=\r\n and done, the key is practical, day or day sadhana. Unless one is making e=\r\nfforts, all theoritical discussions don&#39;t really effect much.\n=C2=A0\nYama/N=\r\niyama/aAsana etc will come through effort and practise. Waiting for it to d=\r\nawn one fine day won&#39;t happen. Which again means, start sadhana in whatever=\r\n way one can if one is really serious about experiencing divinity or for th=\r\nat matter getting a specific saatwik result.\n=C2=A0\nThis is the practical f=\r\nact of the matter. Which, IMHO, is what Narasimha was saying.\n\n\n\n\n-Kind reg=\r\nards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n--- On Thu, 24/6/10, Satish Deshpande &lt;satishdesh@yma=\r\nil.com&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: Satish Deshpande &lt;satishdesh@...&gt;\nSubject: [ve=\r\ndic-astrology] Remedies and priests\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, vedic=\r\n-astrology@yahoogroups.com, JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Thursday, 24=\r\n June, 2010, 1:13 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\nDear Narsimhaji and all respected membe=\r\nrs - Namaste\n\nAstrologers routinely recommend remedial measures involving m=\r\nantras and\npoojas and people spend a lot of money on them.\n\nDo they work? I=\r\n will give my 2 cents of views based on my experience and\ninsights. I will =\r\nbe honest, straight-forward and blunt.\n\n=C2=A0\n\nLike\nme and all others who =\r\nrespect Shri PVR Narsimhaji as a noble, honest,\nintelligent, spiritual pers=\r\non and Sanskrit scholar must be feeling sad after\nreading contents in the p=\r\nost heading efficacy of astro remedies. It=E2=80=99s really\npainful to read=\r\n such thing from a person of his status whom lot of people\nconsidered as a =\r\ngood astro-spiritual personality. Though I am not having\nscripture referenc=\r\nes i=E2=80=99ll try to post my humble protest and request to all\nmembers to=\r\n understand and study shastra deeply for better understanding. \n\nThough bel=\r\nievers call priests and get poojas done, in the hope that their\nproblems wi=\r\nll be solved, many priests today are incapable of producing any\nresults. As=\r\n a result, some believers got accustomed to accepting that a pudding\nexists=\r\n even without eating it and remain hungry throughout life. And some\nintelli=\r\ngent people stopped believing in god and in remedies. Let me first address\n=\r\nwhy this has come to be and then talk about what we should do. \n\nResults\nar=\r\ne produced rather bestowed upon the yajamana by presiding devata or deity a=\r\nnd\nblessings are called =E0=A4=95=E0=A5=83=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE [\nkrupA] Here =\r\nwe think results are produced; so let us understand the method. If\nsomebody=\r\n wants good match for his unmarried daughter and ask some priest to\nperform=\r\n remedy and in turn pay some amount to brahmana or priest. Here the\nfocal p=\r\noint is devata, a supreme authority for this ritual; as on yajamana=E2=80=\r\n=99s\nbehalf priest pray to devata to full feel yajamana=E2=80=99s desire an=\r\nd in return get\npaid. So in this whole exercise priest is a mere mediator o=\r\nr a technician who\ncan interact with both parties. And interaction means co=\r\nrrect rituals with\nappropriate mantras. So his spiritual or mental strength=\r\n is not required but\nhis skill and knowledge is of prime importance. Can we=\r\n consider a mortal priest\nto bless a yajamana? And if a priest can bless ya=\r\njamana what is the role of\nrituals, mantras? The truth is; Blessings are be=\r\nstowed upon the human beings by\ndevatas as only divinity is capable of this=\r\n. And many times fruits are not\nreceived due to karmic blockages of yajaman=\r\na. =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=AF=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=87\n=E0=A4=\r\n=9A=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=82=\r\n =E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82 [=\r\n in kaliyuga four\ntimes efforts are needed] and this is due to loss of anus=\r\nhtAna falA for doing\nbhushudhhI, sharIrashudhhI etc. And this is not an eas=\r\ny\ntask on the part of astrologer to fix the amount of prArabdha karma of\nya=\r\njamana.\n\nIf one has one million dollars in one&#39;s bank account, a check give=\r\nn by one\nfor thousand dollars is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is empty=\r\n, what good\nis a thousand dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Simila=\r\nrly, poojas done\nand blessings given by a priest without enough spiritual e=\r\nnergy cannot bring\none any benefits.\n\n=C2=A0\n\nYajamana get fruits of the ri=\r\ntuals from the inbuilt bank balance of deities\nand not of a priest. A power=\r\nhouse of divine energy, called devata can give\nmillion dollar check to unli=\r\nmited no of people as GOD has sanctioned rather\nappointed them for this wor=\r\nk. In Rugveda tradition in vedic rituals in any\npooja with or without homa =\r\nin the beginning there is one ritual called\naAchAryavarana [=E0=A4=86=E0=A4=\r\n=9A=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=A3] means y=\r\najamana nominate a\npriest for whole ritual to please deity on his behalf an=\r\nd in the end before\nvisarjana of pooja [=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=\r\n=87=E0=A4=AF=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=A6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A8] shreyodAn ritual is perfo=\r\nrmed\nin which priest gives all shreyas i.e. punya generated in ritual to ya=\r\njamana.\nHere we can clearly understand the role of priest and the role of d=\r\neity. As per\nkarmic law if you bless some body you lose your punya and bles=\r\nsed one get that\nshare of punya reducing your strength on all levels. Can a=\r\n mortal though highly\nqualified priest blessed many yajamanas as he interac=\r\nts with many in his lifetime?\nThis could be possible only for highly evolve=\r\nd soul like saints and yogis as\ndue to great penance they do have such powe=\r\nrs. But even for them also some time\nloss of spiritual energy leads for fur=\r\nther penance. We read lot of stories in\nancient mythology of sages enticed =\r\nby apsarAs [superhuman beautiful lady] or if\nthey cursed some body results =\r\nin renewed penances to regain there status.\n\n=C2=A0\n\nOne important note: Th=\r\ne power is not in a combination of syllables (mantra)\nor a sequence of phys=\r\nical actions (ritual). The power is in the MIND that\nFOCUSES on a combinati=\r\non of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical\nactions (ritual). Energy=\r\n is generated when mind overcomes its tendency to\nwander and instead focuse=\r\ns on one thing. Different mantras and rituals as the focus\npoints may gener=\r\nate different kinds of energy, but the key is focus. Without\nit, no mantra =\r\nor ritual produces anything. Focus comes with a lot of practice.\nMost pries=\r\nts are just engaging in casual practice when they go and do poojas.\nIn the =\r\nold days, priests did intense sadhana and brought that energy to the\ntable =\r\nwhen they did rituals at the houses of people or in temples.\n\n=C2=A0\n\n=E0=\r\n=A4=85=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=\r\n=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 [ science of path=\r\nway to GOD] and\n[science of full feeling desires through devata] i.e. =E0=\r\n=A4=A6=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=\r\n=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 =C2=A0are two different things. This science=\r\n of\nmantra and devata is not easy to understand. Divinity is beyond logic a=\r\nnd human\nmind is not capable to experience it easily. As per smruti =E0=A4=\r\n=AE=E0=A4=82=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=80=E0=A4=A8=\r\n=E0=A4=82 =E0=A4=9A =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82 is a dict=\r\num. We are having four types of\nvak [ vani]i.e. vaikharI, madhyamA, pashyan=\r\ntI and parA [=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=96=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=80,\n=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=\r\n=A7=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=BE, =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=\r\n=AF=E0=A4=82=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80, =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE] and last one i=\r\ns the most subtle and\nimp. We see picture of bramhadeva sitting on a lotus =\r\nwhich originates from\nnaval of Vishnu indicating creation origin of univers=\r\ne. This is puran based\nconcept of creation and vedic, tantra tradition are =\r\nhaving same concept with\ndifferent terminology. The subtle seat of paravak =\r\nis at naval and creator\nbrahma creates this world with the help of saraswat=\r\ni and sarsawati is nothing\nbut 52 syllable; =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=\r\n=A4=A3=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BE. Saraswati is embodiment of syll=\r\nables. When two unknown person meets first\ntime how they get connected? Thr=\r\nough communication and thought is a form of\nvak, pashyanti. First there is =\r\ndesire to know each other and then communication\nstarts. And in communicati=\r\non if some body express negativity communication\nstops. So for communicatio=\r\nn soft speech, good words, etc are imp. So how can we\nassume that mantra or=\r\n rituals are of no importance? These show qualities, tools\nnecessary to get=\r\n connected with devatas in right perspective. In scriptures\nevery syllable =\r\nis assigned colour, form, etc. which denotes the nature of that\nsyllable re=\r\nsulting in typical energy. To be precise power rest with desire and\nmind is=\r\n a mere tool to channalise that power and strength of desire will decide\nde=\r\npth of focused mind. So desire is from yajamana, mind is of priest and\nbles=\r\nsings are from pleased devata. Even in great astro treaty like BPHS, sage\np=\r\narAsharA recommended various rituals of various devatas for removing bad\nef=\r\nfects of bad dashas or bad planetary placements. I wonder if mantra and\nrit=\r\nuals do not count why Narsimhaji is having so many homa manuals. \n\nTo consi=\r\nder spiritual aspect of it, persons like saint or yogis who do have\ndharanA=\r\n like a solid rock who always rest in Trans or dhyanavashtA need not\nrequir=\r\ne mantra or tantra, rituals for creating energy. A mere wish of them can\ndo=\r\n work. Normal people like me; require all earlier six steps of ashtAngyOgA =\r\nof\npatanjali like yama, niyama, aAsana, praNAyAm, pratyahAr and dharanA. An=\r\nd these\nall steps are embedded in vedic or tantrik pooja traditions as mant=\r\nra, tantra,\nnyas, etc. So for wish to be get full filled by devata many man=\r\ny things count. =C2=A0\n\n=C2=A0\n\n=C2=A0This whole confusion is due to\nNarsim=\r\nhaji=E2=80=99s sincere wish to spread spirituality and he is doing this wit=\r\nh pure\nheart. Yes, focus mind is one of the factors in this whole exercise.=\r\n Many have\nseen shatachandI or mahArudra anushathAna where many priest at a=\r\n time read or\nchant mantras with different level of mind focus still yajama=\r\nna get fruits of\nit in terms of desires. This is because devata is pleased =\r\nby offerings, japa\nand hOme which in turn bless the yajamana with HIS bless=\r\nings.=C2=A0 For spirituality focus, pure heart and\ncontinuous efforts are o=\r\nf prime importance but for getting our desires to be\nfulfilled we need corr=\r\nect procedure, appropriate deity and correct mantra.\nSpirituality =E0=A4=85=\r\n=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B6=E0=\r\n=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 is a love relationship =\r\nBTW jiva and parmAtmA =E0=A4=AD=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 =E0=A4=\r\n=B8=E0=A4=BE =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=\r\n=87=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE; where as =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=\r\n=87=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=\r\n=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 or mantrashAshtra is a give and take relationship =E0=A4=\r\n=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=9E=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=A8\n=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=\r\n=8D=E0=A4=9E=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=A4. In love\nkarma is not imp =\r\nbut in give and take it is the most imp factor. If someone is\nnamed rAm and=\r\n we call him as ramyA will he be pleased with you? Lord krUshna\nworshiped f=\r\nor begetting child as santangopAla and same krUshana for bhakti are totally=\r\n\ndifferent.\n\n=C2=A0\n\n=C2=A0It is a hype of old great priests which we\nconst=\r\nantly hear but there were millions of greedy, money minded priest all the\nt=\r\nime; its human nature. In every satyayuga we have kaliyuga and that is why\n=\r\nRAVANA a great dashgranthi brahmana ran away with sitA. =C2=A0Narsimhaji fr=\r\neely distributing astrology\nsoftware, lectures, homA manuals is a satyayuga=\r\n in kaliyuga.

The procedures have =\r\nevolved to become quite\ncomplicated over the time too! However, complexity =\r\nof rituals should never be a\ndeterrent. Suppose rules dictate that you MUST=\r\n eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams\nof protein, so many grams of vitamin =\r\nA etc. Suppose you have no access to such\nbalanced food. Will you starve yo=\r\nurself until you find a balanced meal or will\nyou manage with whatever you =\r\nhave? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil soup)\nand rice,\n\nyou will simp=\r\nly eat it. You atleast get some energy. Similarly, if you do\nnot know the &quot;=\r\nperfect way&quot; to do a mantra/ritual, you need not wait\ntill you know the per=\r\nfect way. You can start with what you know. It will only\ngive you energy.\n\n=\r\nThe fear to do rituals without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems from the\nnotion th=\r\nat some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion is not totally\nbasele=\r\nss, but it is irrelevant today. It is possible to focus the mind on some\nma=\r\nntras and rituals and get specific results. When used by someone with a hig=\r\nh\nlevel of spiritual energy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast an=\r\nd give\nspecific powerful results. However, Nature has purposely hidden (alm=\r\nost) such\nthings in this age.\n\n=C2=A0\n\nYes vedic, tantrik rituals are compl=\r\nex and should be done by experts only\nas these are for special purposes and=\r\n should be done by trained people. There\nare hundreds of ways for GOD reali=\r\nzation and a single way to fulfill our\ndesires. If you don=E2=80=99t know h=\r\now to drive a car why opt for a fighter plane? =C2=A0=C2=A0Only if you elde=\r\nrs, gurus have sanctioned it\nthen its ok. Nature has not purposely hidden a=\r\nnything but due to loss of energy\nin doing bhushudhi, sharirashudhhi etc. f=\r\nor removing karmic blocks we feel we\nneed more energy and we are not gettin=\r\ng it. Yes, we should not wait for perfect\nthing as perfection is subjective=\r\n matter but we must read study, think, analyze\nbefore accepting any concept=\r\n. I do fully agree with homA sadhana concept as\nthis is one of the best way=\r\ns for acceleration according to my experiences in my\ntwenties but it is for=\r\n spirituality and for desires to get full filled through\ndeities every thin=\r\ng counts.\n\n=C2=A0\n\n=C2=A0\n\nDifferent mantras and rituals are like begging b=\r\nowls of different shapes.\nThey matter only so much. Depending on what kind =\r\nof a begging bowl you use, you\nmay be given different kind of alms. But it =\r\nis important to start begging with\nsome begging bowl or the other, instead =\r\nof spending years looking for the\nperfect begging bowl. Instead of waiting =\r\nfor astrologers with half-baked or\nill-conceived knowledge to tell you the =\r\nperfect mantra or ritual, do what your\nheart tells you or what your guru (o=\r\nr an elder you respect) tells you.\n\n=C2=A0\n\nWE, the jIvAs are not beggars b=\r\nut anshA of GOD. =E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=80=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=B5 =E0=A4=AC=E0=\r\n=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=B9=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=83 . Human being is the be=\r\nst creativity\nof HIM, the divine. The sole aim of manushyayOnI is to realiz=\r\ne HIM. In this\njourney we may face many types of different obstacles due to=\r\n our karma and to\nsurpass them HE has given us power and rights to use our =\r\nintellect, mind for\nhealthy, wealthy and peaceful life. And whole karma don=\r\ne for this in a pious\nmanner is a sattvic karma. Even for getting fulfilled=\r\n our desires we do have a\nrelationship of respect, love, gratitude with dev=\r\natas.

For ex.

Remedies are needed to full fill desires, by\nre=\r\nmoving karmic blocks we can get this, by doing various correct procedures w=\r\ne\ncan achieve this and this happens due to generated punya in this whole\nex=\r\nercise. For full filling desires we should know the depth of karma, to remo=\r\nve\nkarmic blocks we need appropriate devata, to achieve this we must have e=\r\nxact\ntools in the form of mantra, tantra, rituals etc; and at last generati=\r\non of\npunya in real timeframe. \n\nLet us have a quick look at Narsimhji=E2=\r\n=80=99s post on\nremedy for begetting a child. He has suggested main remedy =\r\nas santangopal\n\nmantra a well known proven remedy. Why he suggested\nthat? I=\r\nf every mantra from his generic list can do this he should have suggested\na=\r\nny one. As per the shashtra the analogy should be like this. Here we will\ns=\r\nidetrack depth of karma as this is near impossible to understand =E0=A4=97=\r\n=E0=A4=B9=E0=A4=A8=E0=A5=8B =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=97=\r\n=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 [ gahanO karmagatI ], at least for me. Consider a\nchildl=\r\ness couple aged 35 years after ten yeas of marriage who desperately need\na =\r\nbaby. Snatangopal is a specific form of Vishnu [ a mahadeity responsible fo=\r\nr\nsustenance of universe ] to bless childless with a baby, the mantra itsel=\r\nf is\nself explanatory as this aims at begetting child and the most imp it w=\r\nill\ngenerate punya in specific timeframe. Yes, every so called generic mant=\r\nra is\ncapable of giving everything to everybody but the main hurdle is time=\r\nframe. If\nwe do any sadhana for long time we accumulate punya; energy to ha=\r\nve all\npleasures in the world whereas the use of this punya depends upon th=\r\ne\nindividual. In this case punya required to beget a child is missing so we=\r\n need\nthat energy in real time frame as after 45/50 it is unlikely that lad=\r\ny will be\ncapable of begetting a child. Yes, all generic mantra will give c=\r\nhild but in\nnext birth as specific form of punya required to beget a baby w=\r\nill be\naccumulated after doing generic mantra for long time rather whole li=\r\nfe time. As\nsaid in vishnusahasranama couple will get all fruits in next bi=\r\nrth including\nbaby and major part of that punya will be consumed for said c=\r\nause of baby\nleaving small part for other pleasures. If we use wooden hamme=\r\nr to fix a nail\nit might take one hour to finish job but metal hammer can d=\r\no this in five\nminutes. This science, not logic is behind different mantra,=\r\n rituals sanctioned\nby sages for different purposes as karma is never gener=\r\nic.\n\nDear Narsihmaji you are doing very noble karma in a\nsattvic manner so =\r\nthousands will read you, hundreds will follow you; so for\nthem and to our s=\r\ncientific spiritual tradition i think you should do justice by\nrethinking o=\r\nn this topic. I myself read your spiritual post with respect but in\nthis ma=\r\ntter you miss the target. =C2=A0\n\n=C2=A0\n\n=C2=A0\n\n=C2=A0\n\n=C2=A0\n\n=C2=A0\n\nY=\r\nours sincerely\n\nSatish\n\n[Non-text portions of this message have been remove=\r\nd]\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1016323201-1277369402=:7766\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Dear Sri&nbsp;Sashi Deshpande ji,\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;It is my belief that you have probably incorrectly understood s=\r\nome of Narasimha&#39;s points. He is not saying that a grossly mispronounced ma=\r\nntra will give you specific results, BUT, if the fear of the 64 things that=\r\n bind a mantra stops an individual from even trying to do japa, THAT is an =\r\neven more serious problem. Therefore, his advise was to start doing sadhana=\r\n in whatever way possible without getting bogged down by technicalities too=\r\n much.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;So desire is from yajamana,=\r\n mind is of priest and blessings are from pleased devata. Even in great ast=\r\nro treaty like BPHS, sage parAsharA recommended various rituals of various =\r\ndevatas for removing bad effects of bad dashas or bad planetary placements.=\r\n I wonder if mantra and rituals do not count why Narsimhaji is having so ma=\r\nny homa manuals. &lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Mantra and rituals surely count, BUT, they by themselves are in=\r\ncapable of producing results UNTILL the individual performing the ritual ha=\r\ns requisite Shaktih. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I have seen learned prie=\r\nsts performing elaborate and technically complex (costly too!)&nbsp;rituals=\r\n which did not produce any result. I wonder how many priests in todays time=\r\n can say with 100 percent certainty that if he does X ritual, he can gauran=\r\ntee a Y result for a yajamana? I have met people who can do this too, they =\r\nwere not priests, but sadhakas.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Most&nbsp;ordi=\r\nnary priests today have zero capability of producing results. The ritual is=\r\n a tool to be used, through which Shakti accumulated by the priest is direc=\r\nted to gain a certain specifc result. Without the Shakti elaborate rituals =\r\nare of no use. They will just not produce tangible results. And results are=\r\n the parameter of judgement. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Shaktih is the r=\r\nesult of accumulated sadhana. Like Narasimha said, a ritual is like a gun a=\r\nnd the Shaktih is like a bullet. Having the gun is good, but without the bu=\r\nllet it won&#39;t work. These days priests do not do enough sadhana and therefo=\r\nre, they cannot gaurantee any results most of the times. In the light of th=\r\ne above, it is better if people perform their own rituals or own sadhana an=\r\nd&nbsp; sincerely ask the Deity to give the results instead of waiting for =\r\na priest to do it, who anyway cannot gaurantee results these days. Religion=\r\n is a practical art. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRON=\r\nG&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;CO=\r\nLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;To consider spiritual aspect of it, pe=\r\nrsons like saint or yogis who do have dharanA like a solid rock who always =\r\nrest in Trans or dhyanavashtA need not require mantra or tantra, rituals fo=\r\nr creating energy. A mere wish of them can do work. Normal people like me; =\r\nrequire all earlier six steps of ashtAngyOgA of patanjali like yama, niyama=\r\n, aAsana, praNAyAm, pratyahAr and dharanA. And these all steps are embedded=\r\n in vedic or tantrik pooja traditions as mantra, tantra, nyas, etc. So for =\r\nwish to be get full filled by devata many many things count.&nbsp;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;COLOR: black;=\r\n FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;COLOR: black; FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;Yes many things coun=\r\nt, but if the count is so high that it stops one from even attempting, it i=\r\ns hardly of any use then. A saint or a yogi does not become a yogi in a sin=\r\ngle day, but by rigorous and continuous sadhana day in and day out, across =\r\nlifetimes. Follow whatever rules one is comfortable with, and just plunge i=\r\nnto sadhana. The results will manifests on their own. And Nature is ever ki=\r\nnd.

As a result,=\r\n some believers got accustomed to accepting that a pudding&lt;BR&gt;exists even w=\r\nithout eating it and remain hungry throughout life. And some&lt;BR&gt;intelligent=\r\n people stopped believing in god and in remedies. Let me first address&lt;BR&gt;w=\r\nhy this has come to be and then talk about what we should do. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Resul=\r\nts&lt;BR&gt;are produced rather bestowed upon the yajamana by presiding devata or=\r\n deity and&lt;BR&gt;blessings are called =E0=A4=95=E0=A5=83=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE [&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;krupA] Here we think results are produced; so let us understand the metho=\r\nd. If&lt;BR&gt;somebody wants good match for his unmarried daughter and ask some =\r\npriest to&lt;BR&gt;perform remedy and in turn pay some amount to brahmana or prie=\r\nst. Here the&lt;BR&gt;focal point is devata, a supreme authority for this ritual;=\r\n as on yajamana=E2=80=99s&lt;BR&gt;behalf priest pray to devata to full feel yaja=\r\nmana=E2=80=99s desire and in return get&lt;BR&gt;paid. So in\n this whole exercise=\r\n priest is a mere mediator or a technician who&lt;BR&gt;can interact with both pa=\r\nrties. And interaction means correct rituals with&lt;BR&gt;appropriate mantras. S=\r\no his spiritual or mental strength is not required but&lt;BR&gt;his skill and kno=\r\nwledge is of prime importance. Can we consider a mortal priest&lt;BR&gt;to bless =\r\na yajamana? And if a priest can bless yajamana what is the role of&lt;BR&gt;ritua=\r\nls, mantras? The truth is; Blessings are bestowed upon the human beings by&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;devatas as only divinity is capable of this. And many times fruits are n=\r\not&lt;BR&gt;received due to karmic blockages of yajamana. =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B2=E0=\r\n=A4=BF=E0=A4=AF=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=87&lt;BR&gt;=E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=81=\r\n=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=97=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=82 =E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=\r\n=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82 [ in kaliyuga four&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;times efforts are needed] and this is due to loss of anushtAna falA for d=\r\noing&lt;BR&gt;bhushudhhI, sharIrashudhhI etc. And this is not an easy&lt;BR&gt;task on =\r\nthe part of astrologer to fix the amount of prArabdha karma of&lt;BR&gt;yajamana.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one has one million dollars in one&#39;s\n bank account, a check give=\r\nn by one&lt;BR&gt;for thousand dollars is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is em=\r\npty, what good&lt;BR&gt;is a thousand dollar check given by one? It will bounce. =\r\nSimilarly, poojas done&lt;BR&gt;and blessings given by a priest without enough sp=\r\niritual energy cannot bring&lt;BR&gt;one any benefits.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yajam=\r\nana get fruits of the rituals from the inbuilt bank balance of deities&lt;BR&gt;a=\r\nnd not of a priest. A powerhouse of divine energy, called devata can give&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;million dollar check to unlimited no of people as GOD has sanctioned rath=\r\ner&lt;BR&gt;appointed them for this work. In Rugveda tradition in vedic rituals i=\r\nn any&lt;BR&gt;pooja with or without homa in the beginning there is one ritual ca=\r\nlled&lt;BR&gt;aAchAryavarana [=E0=A4=86=E0=A4=9A=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=\r\n=AF=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=A3] means yajamana nominate a&lt;BR&gt;priest for who=\r\nle ritual to please deity on his behalf and in the end before&lt;BR&gt;visarjana =\r\nof pooja [=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=AF=E0=A5=8B=E0=A4=A6=\r\n=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A8] shreyodAn ritual is performed&lt;BR&gt;in which priest gives\n=\r\n all shreyas i.e. punya generated in ritual to yajamana.&lt;BR&gt;Here we can cle=\r\narly understand the role of priest and the role of deity. As per&lt;BR&gt;karmic =\r\nlaw if you bless some body you lose your punya and blessed one get that&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nshare of punya reducing your strength on all levels. Can a mortal though hi=\r\nghly&lt;BR&gt;qualified priest blessed many yajamanas as he interacts with many i=\r\nn his lifetime?&lt;BR&gt;This could be possible only for highly evolved soul like=\r\n saints and yogis as&lt;BR&gt;due to great penance they do have such powers. But =\r\neven for them also some time&lt;BR&gt;loss of spiritual energy leads for further =\r\npenance. We read lot of stories in&lt;BR&gt;ancient mythology of sages enticed by=\r\n apsarAs [superhuman beautiful lady] or if&lt;BR&gt;they cursed some body results=\r\n in renewed penances to regain there status.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One impor=\r\ntant note: The power is not in a combination of syllables (mantra)&lt;BR&gt;or a =\r\nsequence of physical actions (ritual). The power is in the MIND\n that&lt;BR&gt;FO=\r\nCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical&lt;BR&gt;a=\r\nctions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overcomes its tendency to&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;wander and instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras and rituals as =\r\nthe focus&lt;BR&gt;points may generate different kinds of energy, but the key is =\r\nfocus. Without&lt;BR&gt;it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. Focus comes wi=\r\nth a lot of practice.&lt;BR&gt;Most priests are just engaging in casual practice =\r\nwhen they go and do poojas.&lt;BR&gt;In the old days, priests did intense sadhana=\r\n and brought that energy to the&lt;BR&gt;table when they did rituals at the house=\r\ns of people or in temples.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=E0=A4=85=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=8D=\r\n=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=\r\n=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 [ science of pathway to GOD] and&lt;BR&gt;[scie=\r\nnce of full feeling desires through devata] i.e. =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=\r\n=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=\r\n=E0=A4=B0 &nbsp;are two different things. This science of&lt;BR&gt;mantra and dev=\r\nata is not easy to understand. Divinity is beyond logic and\n human&lt;BR&gt;mind =\r\nis not capable to experience it easily. As per smruti =E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=82=E0=\r\n=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=80=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=82 =E0=\r\n=A4=9A =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=82 is a dictum. We are ha=\r\nving four types of&lt;BR&gt;vak [ vani]i.e. vaikharI, madhyamA, pashyantI and par=\r\nA [=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=96=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=80,&lt;BR&gt;=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=A7=E0=\r\n=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=BE, =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=\r\n=A4=82=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80, =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE] and last one is the =\r\nmost subtle and&lt;BR&gt;imp. We see picture of bramhadeva sitting on a lotus whi=\r\nch originates from&lt;BR&gt;naval of Vishnu indicating creation origin of univers=\r\ne. This is puran based&lt;BR&gt;concept of creation and vedic, tantra tradition a=\r\nre having same concept with&lt;BR&gt;different terminology. The subtle seat of pa=\r\nravak is at naval and creator&lt;BR&gt;brahma creates this world with the help of=\r\n saraswati and sarsawati is nothing&lt;BR&gt;but 52 syllable; =E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=B0=\r\n=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A3=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B2=E0=A4=BE. Saraswati is embodi=\r\nment of syllables. When two unknown person meets first&lt;BR&gt;time how they get=\r\n connected? Through communication and thought is a form of&lt;BR&gt;vak, pashyant=\r\ni. First there is desire to\n know each other and then communication&lt;BR&gt;star=\r\nts. And in communication if some body express negativity communication&lt;BR&gt;s=\r\ntops. So for communication soft speech, good words, etc are imp. So how can=\r\n we&lt;BR&gt;assume that mantra or rituals are of no importance? These show quali=\r\nties, tools&lt;BR&gt;necessary to get connected with devatas in right perspective=\r\n. In scriptures&lt;BR&gt;every syllable is assigned colour, form, etc. which deno=\r\ntes the nature of that&lt;BR&gt;syllable resulting in typical energy. To be preci=\r\nse power rest with desire and&lt;BR&gt;mind is a mere tool to channalise that pow=\r\ner and strength of desire will decide&lt;BR&gt;depth of focused mind. So desire i=\r\ns from yajamana, mind is of priest and&lt;BR&gt;blessings are from pleased devata=\r\n. Even in great astro treaty like BPHS, sage&lt;BR&gt;parAsharA recommended vario=\r\nus rituals of various devatas for removing bad&lt;BR&gt;effects of bad dashas or =\r\nbad planetary placements. I wonder if mantra and&lt;BR&gt;rituals do not count wh=\r\ny Narsimhaji is\n having so many homa manuals. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To consider spiritual=\r\n aspect of it, persons like saint or yogis who do have&lt;BR&gt;dharanA like a so=\r\nlid rock who always rest in Trans or dhyanavashtA need not&lt;BR&gt;require mantr=\r\na or tantra, rituals for creating energy. A mere wish of them can&lt;BR&gt;do wor=\r\nk. Normal people like me; require all earlier six steps of ashtAngyOgA of&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;patanjali like yama, niyama, aAsana, praNAyAm, pratyahAr and dharanA. And=\r\n these&lt;BR&gt;all steps are embedded in vedic or tantrik pooja traditions as ma=\r\nntra, tantra,&lt;BR&gt;nyas, etc. So for wish to be get full filled by devata man=\r\ny many things count. &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;This whole confusion=\r\n is due to&lt;BR&gt;Narsimhaji=E2=80=99s sincere wish to spread spirituality and =\r\nhe is doing this with pure&lt;BR&gt;heart. Yes, focus mind is one of the factors =\r\nin this whole exercise. Many have&lt;BR&gt;seen shatachandI or mahArudra anushath=\r\nAna where many priest at a time read or&lt;BR&gt;chant mantras with different lev=\r\nel of mind\n focus still yajamana get fruits of&lt;BR&gt;it in terms of desires. T=\r\nhis is because devata is pleased by offerings, japa&lt;BR&gt;and hOme which in tu=\r\nrn bless the yajamana with HIS blessings.&nbsp; For spirituality focus, pur=\r\ne heart and&lt;BR&gt;continuous efforts are of prime importance but for getting o=\r\nur desires to be&lt;BR&gt;fulfilled we need correct procedure, appropriate deity =\r\nand correct mantra.&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=A7=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=\r\n=A4=BE=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=\r\n=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 is a love relationship BTW jiva and parmAtmA =E0=A4=\r\n=AD=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 =E0=A4=B8=E0=A4=BE =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=\r\n=B0=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=AA=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=81=\r\n=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE; where as =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=B5=E0=A4=A4=E0=A4=BE=\r\n=E0=A4=B6=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0 or mantrash=\r\nAshtra is a give and take relationship =E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=9E=\r\n=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=A8&lt;BR&gt;=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=9E=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=\r\n=AF=E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=A4. In love&lt;BR&gt;karma is not imp but in give and take it =\r\nis the most imp factor. If someone is&lt;BR&gt;named rAm and we call him as ramyA=\r\n will he be pleased with you? Lord krUshna&lt;BR&gt;worshiped for begetting child=\r\n as santangopAla and same krUshana for bhakti are\n totally&lt;BR&gt;different.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;It is a hype of old great priests which we&lt;BR&gt;cons=\r\ntantly hear but there were millions of greedy, money minded priest all the&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;time; its human nature. In every satyayuga we have kaliyuga and that is =\r\nwhy&lt;BR&gt;RAVANA a great dashgranthi brahmana ran away with sitA. &nbsp;Narsim=\r\nhaji freely distributing astrology&lt;BR&gt;software, lectures, homA manuals is a=\r\n satyayuga in kaliyuga. So don=E2=80=99t blame&lt;BR&gt;today=E2=80=99s priest; t=\r\no become perfect in karmakAndA a priest at least give his ten&lt;BR&gt;yeas to be=\r\ncome perfect in rituals. In old golden days life was simple, there&lt;BR&gt;was =\r\n=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=AF an=\r\nd =E0=A4=9C=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B6=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=AF to bramha=\r\nna.

BTW, Sadhana of\n priest was and is a&lt;BR&gt;personal advantage=\r\n due to punyakarma [past birth=E2=80=99s good deeds] of yajamana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;We must&lt;BR&gt;have gratitude for whole&nbsp; past&lt;BR&gt;g=\r\nenerations &nbsp;for maintaining such a divine&lt;BR&gt;science in oral tradition=\r\n for thousands of years with such a accuracy[ they&lt;BR&gt;know power of syllabl=\r\nes, so they maintained sanctity of akashrA, =E0=A4=85=E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=\r\n=A4=B7=E0=A4=B0- =E0=A4=A8 =E0=A4=95=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=B7=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=A4=E0=\r\n=A4=BF -&lt;BR&gt;non-perishable ] due to which we can proclaim ourselves as vedi=\r\nc&lt;BR&gt;astrologers, yoga gurus, vedic healers, vedic mathematicians etc. Yes,=\r\n we must&lt;BR&gt;mould / change according to [ =E0=A4=A6=E0=A5=87=E0=A4=B6, =E0=\r\n=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B2, =E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=B8=E0=A5=8D=E0=\r\n=A4=A5=E0=A4=BF=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 ] surroundings, time and environments but=\r\n we must not let go real ethics,&lt;BR&gt;morals, rules of our ancient proved tra=\r\nditions. &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Many people think that poojas to gods are a serious =\r\nmatter and only a&lt;BR&gt;trained priest should do them. The procedures have evo=\r\nlved to become quite&lt;BR&gt;complicated over the\n time too! However, complexity=\r\n of rituals should never be a&lt;BR&gt;deterrent. Suppose rules dictate that you =\r\nMUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams&lt;BR&gt;of protein, so many grams of v=\r\nitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access to such&lt;BR&gt;balanced food. Will you=\r\n starve yourself until you find a balanced meal or will&lt;BR&gt;you manage with =\r\nwhatever you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil soup)&lt;BR&gt;and rice=\r\n,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;you will simply eat it. You atleast get some energy. Similarly, if=\r\n you do&lt;BR&gt;not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a mantra/ritual, you need not w=\r\nait&lt;BR&gt;till you know the perfect way. You can start with what you know. It =\r\nwill only&lt;BR&gt;give you energy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The fear to do rituals without &quot;perfec=\r\nt knowledge&quot; stems from the&lt;BR&gt;notion that some mantras/rituals can be dang=\r\nerous. That notion is not totally&lt;BR&gt;baseless, but it is irrelevant today. =\r\nIt is possible to focus the mind on some&lt;BR&gt;mantras and rituals and get spe=\r\ncific results. When used by someone\n with a high&lt;BR&gt;level of spiritual ener=\r\ngy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast and give&lt;BR&gt;specific powerf=\r\nul results. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almost) such&lt;BR&gt;things in=\r\n this age.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yes vedic, tantrik rituals are complex and =\r\nshould be done by experts only&lt;BR&gt;as these are for special purposes and sho=\r\nuld be done by trained people. There&lt;BR&gt;are hundreds of ways for GOD realiz=\r\nation and a single way to fulfill our&lt;BR&gt;desires. If you don=E2=80=99t know=\r\n how to drive a car why opt for a fighter plane? &nbsp;&nbsp;Only if you el=\r\nders, gurus have sanctioned it&lt;BR&gt;then its ok. Nature has not purposely hid=\r\nden anything but due to loss of energy&lt;BR&gt;in doing bhushudhi, sharirashudhh=\r\ni etc. for removing karmic blocks we feel we&lt;BR&gt;need more energy and we are=\r\n not getting it. Yes, we should not wait for perfect&lt;BR&gt;thing as perfection=\r\n is subjective matter but we must read study, think, analyze&lt;BR&gt;before acce=\r\npting any concept. I do fully agree\n with homA sadhana concept as&lt;BR&gt;this i=\r\ns one of the best ways for acceleration according to my experiences in my&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;twenties but it is for spirituality and for desires to get full filled th=\r\nrough&lt;BR&gt;deities every thing counts.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dif=\r\nferent mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of different shapes.&lt;BR&gt;T=\r\nhey matter only so much. Depending on what kind of a begging bowl you use, =\r\nyou&lt;BR&gt;may be given different kind of alms. But it is important to start be=\r\ngging with&lt;BR&gt;some begging bowl or the other, instead of spending years loo=\r\nking for the&lt;BR&gt;perfect begging bowl. Instead of waiting for astrologers wi=\r\nth half-baked or&lt;BR&gt;ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfect mantra =\r\nor ritual, do what your&lt;BR&gt;heart tells you or what your guru (or an elder y=\r\nou respect) tells you.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;WE, the jIvAs are not beggars b=\r\nut anshA of GOD. =E0=A4=9C=E0=A5=80=E0=A4=B5=E0=A5=88=E0=A4=B5 =E0=A4=AC=E0=\r\n=A5=8D=E0=A4=B0=E0=A4=B9=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=83 . Human being is the be=\r\nst creativity&lt;BR&gt;of HIM,\n the divine. The sole aim of manushyayOnI is to re=\r\nalize HIM. In this&lt;BR&gt;journey we may face many types of different obstacles=\r\n due to our karma and to&lt;BR&gt;surpass them HE has given us power and rights t=\r\no use our intellect, mind for&lt;BR&gt;healthy, wealthy and peaceful life. And wh=\r\nole karma done for this in a pious&lt;BR&gt;manner is a sattvic karma. Even for g=\r\netting fulfilled our desires we do have a&lt;BR&gt;relationship of respect, love,=\r\n gratitude with devatas. Beggars don=E2=80=99t have any&lt;BR&gt;feelings for don=\r\nors instead they even don=E2=80=99t remember them.

For example, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra explicitly says it ca=\r\nn&lt;BR&gt;solve ANY problem. Instead of looking for a&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;perfect&lt;BR&gt;mantra =\r\nrecommendation&quot;, you can pick a generic mantra like that and start&lt;BR&gt;sadha=\r\nna. The key is faith and persistence.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If&lt;BR&gt;your kaarmik blockage is=\r\n the size of a rock, small amount energy may be enough&lt;BR&gt;to move it away. =\r\nIf it is the size\n of a big&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;boulder&lt;BR&gt;on the other hand, much more =\r\nenergy may be needed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It&lt;BR&gt;seems Narsimhji is in too =\r\nmuch hurry to spread concept of homa in this world.&lt;BR&gt;Yes, as this concept=\r\n is blessed by divine mother homa is going to be popular&lt;BR&gt;sadhana in comi=\r\nng years. In his anxiety to spread this blessing he is&lt;BR&gt;contradicting his=\r\n own words. Mantras do have vargabheda and can be broadly&lt;BR&gt;categorized as=\r\n&nbsp; shrutimantra,&lt;BR&gt;smritimantra, puranmantrra and varadamantra. For ex=\r\n. We can broadly classify savitur&lt;BR&gt;gayatri as shrutimantra; chandipatha a=\r\ns smrutinmantra; vishnusahastranam as&lt;BR&gt;puranmantra and shabarimantra[crea=\r\nted by great navanath yogis] as varadamantra.&lt;BR&gt;The term generic is itself=\r\n illusive. Every devata, every mantra is assigned&lt;BR&gt;different power, diffe=\r\nrent work by cosmic mother. It is HER wish for this&lt;BR&gt;classification. =E0=\r\n=A4=89=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B8=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=\r\n=82 =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=\r\n=8D=E0=A4=A5=E0=A4=82( =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AF=E0=A4=\r\n=BE=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=A5=E0=A5=87\n ) =E0=A4=AC=E0=A4=B9=E0=A5=8D=E0=\r\n=A4=AE=E0=A4=A3=E0=A5=8B&lt;BR&gt;=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=81=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B2=\r\n=E0=A5=8D=E0=A4=AA=E0=A4=A8=E0=A4=BE [ For&lt;BR&gt;fulfilling jiva=E2=80=99s des=\r\nires and subsequent karma GOD manifest in different form ]&lt;BR&gt;is the nucleu=\r\ns of all devatabheda and related different forms, mantra, rituals&lt;BR&gt;etc. &=\r\nnbsp;Why remedies are needed, how they&lt;BR&gt;can give desirable fruits, how ca=\r\nn we achieve this and last but imp how this&lt;BR&gt;happen should be focal point=\r\n here. Remedies are needed to full fill desires, by&lt;BR&gt;removing karmic bloc=\r\nks we can get this, by doing various correct procedures we&lt;BR&gt;can achieve t=\r\nhis and this happens due to generated punya in this whole&lt;BR&gt;exercise. For =\r\nfull filling desires we should know the depth of karma, to remove&lt;BR&gt;karmic=\r\n blocks we need appropriate devata, to achieve this we must have exact&lt;BR&gt;t=\r\nools in the form of mantra, tantra, rituals etc; and at last generation of&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;punya in real timeframe. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let us have a quick look at Narsimhji=\r\n=E2=80=99s post on&lt;BR&gt;remedy for begetting a child. He has\n suggested main =\r\nremedy as santangopal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;mantra a well known proven remedy. Why he sugg=\r\nested&lt;BR&gt;that? If every mantra from his generic list can do this he should =\r\nhave suggested&lt;BR&gt;any one. As per the shashtra the analogy should be like t=\r\nhis. Here we will&lt;BR&gt;sidetrack depth of karma as this is near impossible to=\r\n understand =E0=A4=97=E0=A4=B9=E0=A4=A8=E0=A5=8B =E0=A4=95=E0=A4=B0=E0=A5=\r\n=8D=E0=A4=AE=E0=A4=97=E0=A4=A4=E0=A5=80 [ gahanO karmagatI ], at least for =\r\nme. Consider a&lt;BR&gt;childless couple aged 35 years after ten yeas of marriage=\r\n who desperately need&lt;BR&gt;a baby. Snatangopal is a specific form of Vishnu [=\r\n a mahadeity responsible for&lt;BR&gt;sustenance of universe ] to bless childless=\r\n with a baby, the mantra itself is&lt;BR&gt;self explanatory as this aims at bege=\r\ntting child and the most imp it will&lt;BR&gt;generate punya in specific timefram=\r\ne. Yes, every so called generic mantra is&lt;BR&gt;capable of giving everything t=\r\no everybody but the main hurdle is timeframe. If&lt;BR&gt;we do any sadhana for l=\r\nong time we accumulate punya; energy to have\n all&lt;BR&gt;pleasures in the world=\r\n whereas the use of this punya depends upon the&lt;BR&gt;individual. In this case=\r\n punya required to beget a child is missing so we need&lt;BR&gt;that energy in re=\r\nal time frame as after 45/50 it is unlikely that lady will be&lt;BR&gt;capable of=\r\n begetting a child. Yes, all generic mantra will give child but in&lt;BR&gt;next =\r\nbirth as specific form of punya required to beget a baby will be&lt;BR&gt;accumul=\r\nated after doing generic mantra for long time rather whole life time. As&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;said in vishnusahasranama couple will get all fruits in next birth includi=\r\nng&lt;BR&gt;baby and major part of that punya will be consumed for said cause of =\r\nbaby&lt;BR&gt;leaving small part for other pleasures. If we use wooden hammer to =\r\nfix a nail&lt;BR&gt;it might take one hour to finish job but metal hammer can do =\r\nthis in five&lt;BR&gt;minutes. This science, not logic is behind different mantra=\r\n, rituals sanctioned&lt;BR&gt;by sages for different purposes as karma is never g=\r\neneric.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Dear Narsihmaji you are\n doing very noble karma in a&lt;BR&gt;satt=\r\nvic manner so thousands will read you, hundreds will follow you; so for&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nthem and to our scientific spiritual tradition i think you should do justic=\r\ne by&lt;BR&gt;rethinking on this topic. I myself read your spiritual post with re=\r\nspect but in&lt;BR&gt;this matter you miss the target. &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yours sincerely&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Satish&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;[Non-text portions of this message have been removed]&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\r\n--0-1016323201-1277369402=:7766--\r\n\n"}}
