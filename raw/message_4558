That way one could make an\nanalysis of before and after being obse=\r\nrved. But how are you going to do\nthat?  Why not try not existing and then =\r\nobserve what Objective Reality\nis like with nothing observing it.   :- ) It=\r\n is the same as asking as to\nwhat would be the content of consciousness if =\r\nnothing were conscious. \nThe Observer cannot be taken out of the equation. =\r\nConsciousness permits\nobservation.\n\n\n\nHowever, that which is Observed and k=\r\nnown in the Timeless mode of being\nin the ground of our cognitive existence=\r\n is nothing like that which is\nbeing observed in Spacetime. You can only ve=\r\nrify this fact by going\nthere to find out for yourself. So don&#39;t play silly=\r\n guessing games\nor come the old `in my opinion&#39; or `I believe&#39;, for all\ntha=\r\nt is hogwash and bunkum. Go there and find out and then you will\nKNOW.\n\n\n\nO=\r\nne of the very first questions I had to ask myself after finding that\nTimel=\r\ness mode of being was `WHY&#39;?  Not as to why that existed,\nbecause all that =\r\nbit made sense; but rather as to why time and space\nexisted and me out here=\r\n existed, and all this stuff out here existed. \nIt took me another twenty y=\r\nears to find out why.\n\n\n\nYou can take all your religions, all your beliefs,=\r\n all your opinions,\nand stick them up that dark place.  But IF you are seri=\r\nous about\nlearning, and serious about the meaning of the words Honour, Dign=\r\nity,\nand Integrity, (let alone love) then I suggest humanity take a course =\r\nin\nlearning instead of paying homage and reverence to their silly retarded\n=\r\nantiquated prehistoric belief packages. Will that happen in the\nforeseeable=\r\n future?  In the meantime pay attention as to what effect\nObjectivity has o=\r\nn the Observer. It was doing just that which kicked me\ninto all of this. Yo=\r\nu try it.\n\n\n\nNo matter where you exist, or when, in Time or Beyond, conscio=\r\nusness\nwill ALWAYS contain CONTENT.  It would be prudent and wise to study =\r\nits\nCONTENT.
