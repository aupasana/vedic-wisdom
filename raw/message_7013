It=\r\n is only the Guru who will find out your defects. The nature of egoism is s=\r\nuch that you will not be able to find out your own defects. Just as a man c=\r\nannot see his back, so also he cannot see his own errors. He must live unde=\r\nr a Guru for the eradication of his evil qualities and defects.\n\nThe aspira=\r\nnt who is under the guidance of a Master or Guru is safe from being led ast=\r\nray. Satsanga or association with the Guru is an armour and fortress to gua=\r\nrd you against all temptations and unfavourable forces of the material worl=\r\nd.\n\nCases of those who had attained perfection without study under any Guru=\r\n should not be cited as authority against the necessity of a Guru; for, suc=\r\nh great men are the anomalies of spiritual life, and not the common normali=\r\nty. They come into existence as spiritual masters as a result of the intens=\r\ne service, study, and meditation practised in previous births. They had alr=\r\neady studied under the Guru. The present birth is only its continuative spi=\r\nritual effect. Hence, the importance of the Guru is not lessened thereby.\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
