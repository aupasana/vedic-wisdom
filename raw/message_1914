Vasishtha reveals t=\r\nhe true nature of Rama then and \n&gt; Rama remains in samadhi. Vasishtha has t=\r\no finally enter the Sushumna nadi of \n&gt; Rama to disturb his samadhi and bri=\r\nng him back to senses. After that, Rama \n&gt; knows who he is.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rama and K=\r\nrishna were both avataras of Vishnu. Krishna knew it from the \n&gt; beginning.=\r\n In the case of Rama, sages like Vasishtha, Vishwamitra knew it \n&gt; even bef=\r\nore Rama&#39;s birth, but Rama himself did not know it in the beginning. \n&gt; But=\r\n he too knew it later.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, Krishna had complete mastery over the =\r\nduality, while Rama did not. \n&gt; Rama had to wade the dual world like normal=\r\n people.

He was still not God. Or, at least, he never realised he was \n&gt; &gt; an avat=\r\nar (one who undergoes an &#39;avataran&#39; (coming down to earth to serve \n&gt; &gt; a s=\r\npecific purpose of the society of his time).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It was latter day writ=\r\ners like Tulsidas who conferred godhood on Ram.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is this true?
