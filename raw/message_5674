Why would the oldest language in the world and so ad=\r\nvanced at that not have a script? Or is this knowledge hidden from us till =\r\ndate?\n\nIt is hard to imagine that such a perfect and beautiful language so =\r\nwidely used (and maybe for secular purposes also) would not have a script! =\r\nE.g. if yantra&#39;s were made what script were they written in?\n\nIs it also po=\r\nssible that we lost many precious treasures of knowledge over the years as =\r\nthey were not written down? Writing down is somehow similar to burying a po=\r\nt of gold to be recovered later on, isn&#39;t it?\n\nAlso, if Devanagari was used=\r\n later on to write sanskit how come it suddenly sprang from Brahmi? And cam=\r\ne to be widely used throughout India? Who would have spread the writing? Is=\r\n there any record?\n\nPlease pardon any foolish statements made above as I am=\r\n just curious.\n\nRespectfully,\n\nGirish\n\n\n"}}
