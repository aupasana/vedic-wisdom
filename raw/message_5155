I am wondering why people are=\r\n not discussing about my question no. 1 in mail to Shri Satya Prakash Garu.=\r\n Is something inherently wrong with question itself? \n\nAlso, about this fea=\r\nr about kundalini going awry in untrained/unsupervised people, how justifie=\r\nd is it if one is prepared to face the consequences? For instance in Dhyana=\r\n Yoga (atma samyama yoga - chapter 6) Arjuna asks the lord as to what happe=\r\nns to the yoga brashta and the Lord replies saying that such a person would=\r\n be given a better opportunity in the next life to continue the sadhana (ve=\r\nrses 37-47)! When there are such assurances by the Lord himself in devi mah=\r\natmyam and bhagavadgita, why are we debating on every other point but these=\r\n divine words themselves? Please correct me if I am wrong here. I don&#39;t mea=\r\nn to question your deep knowledge here, but eager to learn something here. =\r\n\n\nNagraj Kota \n\n--- On Wed, 10/27/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; w=\r\nrote:\n\n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] More on Initiation\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, =\r\nOctober 27, 2010, 9:18 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;       \n&gt;       Namaste Satya P=\r\nrakash garu,\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Welcome to the list and it is a pleasure to have y=\r\nour\n&gt; learned company here.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Traditional conventions are not wit=\r\nhout basis, but I\n&gt; suggest we need to understand their motivation.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; When one chants long prayers such as C=\r\nhandipath, Vishnu\n&gt; sahasra naama stotra, Aditya Hridayam etc, it requires =\r\na lot\n&gt; of conscious mental activity. One mostly cannot go into\n&gt; samadhi w=\r\nhile chanting them (though there can be\n&gt; exceptions). On the other hand, w=\r\nhen one chants Gayatri\n&gt; mantra or ashtakshari mantra or dwadasakshari mant=\r\nra or\n&gt; panchakshari mantra or navarna mantra or various beeja\n&gt; mantras or=\r\n other small mantras, it requires a minimal amount\n&gt; of conscious mental ac=\r\ntivity. With repetitive and minimal\n&gt; mental activity, there is a possibili=\r\nty of momentary\n&gt; cessation of mental activity and entering samadhi OR\n&gt; aw=\r\nakening of Kundalini and progress towards samadhi.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; If one reach=\r\nes samadhi directly when Kundalini awakens,\n&gt; things are fine. But, that ma=\r\ny not happen. Kundalini can\n&gt; take many different paths and go to different=\r\n places.\n&gt; Depending on the impurities in various nadis, various\n&gt; experien=\r\nces are possible. If a sadhaka is unprepared to\n&gt; handle the experience, it=\r\n can create problems. One can\n&gt; experience something nice and become proud =\r\nand egoistic and\n&gt; get stuck there. One can experience a very fierce form o=\r\nf\n&gt; divine and get scared to death or go mad. Many possibilities\n&gt; are ther=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, practices that can truly awaken one were kept limited\n=\r\n&gt; to the initiated. Guru would assess the progress and\n&gt; readiness of a sad=\r\nhaka and initiate one when one is ready.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; However, there are a few things that are different in\n&gt; today&#39;s t=\r\nimes:\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; (1) There are very few people who are ready to experience=\r\n\n&gt; something. Most people will just do sadhana, burn some basic\n&gt; blocking =\r\nkarmas and not really experience much. At most,\n&gt; some people will experien=\r\nce an awakening and just a little\n&gt; movement of Kundalini.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) There a=\r\nre very few gurus who are indeed capable of\n&gt; assessing and guiding a sadha=\r\nka well. Most initiations are a\n&gt; mere formality.\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) With the insiste=\r\nnce on initiation etc, we may be\n&gt; blocking, in the coming years, the very =\r\nfew sadhakas who MAY\n&gt; actually achieve some progress with a mantra, from e=\r\nven\n&gt; trying it.\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) If a sadhaka surrenders and has the attitude of &quot;=\r\nI\n&gt; do not know the right way. I am just doing what I am capable\n&gt; of. Plea=\r\nse take care of me Mother&quot;, none of the risks I\n&gt; mentioned above will real=\r\nly apply.\n&gt; \n&gt; (5) Especially if one does not engage in raja yoga/hatha\n&gt; y=\r\noga practices that are meant to forcefully awaken and raise\n&gt; Kundalini and=\r\n if one does not consciously think in terms of\n&gt; raising Kundalini, one is =\r\nsafe.\n&gt; \n&gt; (6) If one is not looking for any specific results and\n&gt; doing a=\r\n mantra just for spiritual progress with a sense of\n&gt; surrender, one is saf=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Apart from assessing the rea=\r\ndiness, there are some more\n&gt; functions performed by an initiating guru:\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; (1) A guru can jumpstart one&#39;s sadhana with a mantra\n&gt; and result=\r\ns can come faster.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; However, this expects a guru of some caliber=\r\n and\n&gt; achievement with the mantra. After all, if one wants a\n&gt; one-on-one =\r\naudience with Sachin Tendulkar or Roger Federer\n&gt; or Barack Obama, being in=\r\ntroduced to them by someone they\n&gt; know and someone that had a one-on-one a=\r\nudience with them\n&gt; earlier can be helpful (instead of introducing by onese=\r\nlf).\n&gt; If someone who merely read more about them but is not any\n&gt; closer t=\r\no them tries to introduce you to them, will it even\n&gt; get their attention?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Now-a-days, most people do not have access to gurus who\n&gt; have =\r\nexperienced the divine with a mantra. Such people are\n&gt; very rare. One&#39;s be=\r\nst bet is to do sadhana by oneself,\n&gt; using all the tools given by rishis a=\r\nnd various spiritual\n&gt; masters. When one is ready (and if it is needed), a =\r\nguru may\n&gt; come and take one&#39;s sadhana to the next level.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; (2) A=\r\n guru can mould the correct attitude in sadhaka before\n&gt; a sadhana is taken=\r\n up.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; However, there are sadhakas initiated in powerful mantras\n=\r\n&gt; and not having the right attitude. For example, I know\n&gt; people initiated=\r\n into Bagalamukhi mantra and trying to use\n&gt; it to win litigation. If one d=\r\noes not know that a\n&gt; &quot;Mahavidya&quot; (supreme knowledge) is for overcoming\n&gt; c=\r\nonditioning and realizing self and not for winning court\n&gt; cases, one&#39;s ini=\r\ntiation is no good.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, I know some people not f=\r\normally\n&gt; initiated into Chandipath, but doing Chandi homam daily with\n&gt; sa=\r\nptashati and also navarna mantra. I know that they do not\n&gt; have any specif=\r\nic material goals and are overcoming the few\n&gt; desires that were originally=\r\n there at the back of the mind.\n&gt; The are making quick progress spiritually=\r\n and their thinking\n&gt; is getting transformed nicely. Despite having no form=\r\nal\n&gt; initiation, aren&#39;t they worshipping Chandi as a\n&gt; Mahavidya?\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Bottomline is that one can mould one&#39;s own attitude\n&gt; through a formal i=\r\nnitiation or through reading scriptures,\n&gt; satsanga and constant contemplat=\r\nion. One thing may work\n&gt; better in one case and another thing in another c=\r\nase.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; (3) A guru can teach the correct procedure of a sadhana.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; However, role of procedural correctness in success is a\n&gt; higher=\r\n in sadhanas for specific results than sadhana for\n&gt; spiritual progress. I =\r\nmaintain that the art of getting\n&gt; specific results from sadhanas is being =\r\nhidden more and more\n&gt; as Kali progresses, for a reason. I suggest that it =\r\nis\n&gt; useless to even think in those terms and pursue it.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Mantra=\r\ns like navarna mantra can just be meditated on,\n&gt; without any specific proc=\r\nedure. When one is ready and pure\n&gt; enough, they can give one an experience=\r\n of the divine.\n&gt; Mantras like Siddha Kunjika stotra, that codify several\n&gt;=\r\n specific sadhanas to get specific results, are anyway\n&gt; inaccessible to mo=\r\nst people of this age! They are only\n&gt; available in codified form and gurus=\r\n who can decode them\n&gt; will keep disappearing more and more.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; For those who are already doing Sri Sri Cha=\r\nndi path\n&gt; without initiation, there is\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; no need to worry or be confu=\r\nsed. ... Please keep doing\n&gt; whatever you are doing.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Given this=\r\n statement, the difference of opinion between us\n&gt; are very subtle.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; One word on guilt here. If someone is doing a practice and\n&gt; feels a s=\r\nense of guilt, it blocks the practice from working\n&gt; effectively. Please do=\r\n whatever sadhana you do, without a\n&gt; sense of guilt. If you have the sense=\r\n of guilt, work on\n&gt; overcoming it. If you cannot overcome it, it may be a =\r\ngood\n&gt; idea to find a sadhana with which you feel comfortable and\n&gt; have no=\r\n sense of guilt.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Things will happen on their own accord in th=\r\ne natural\n&gt; flow. Leave the rest to\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; the compassionate Goddess.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; That&#39;s the bottomline. Even if one were initiated, it\n&gt; would be qui=\r\nte difficult to not leave things to the Goddess\n&gt; and make things happen as=\r\n one wanted. Start sadhana with\n&gt; some level of surrender. Then, sadhana wi=\r\nll help increase\n&gt; the level of surrender. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj garu,\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; The opinion referred to in your quest=\r\nion 2 is not without\n&gt; basis. But again, we need to understand the motivati=\r\non to\n&gt; put it in the right perspective.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; If one experiences div=\r\nine through sadhana with Gayatri\n&gt; mantra (or any mantra), then it is easy =\r\nfor one to\n&gt; experience divine with another mantra. One can just pick up\n&gt; =\r\na mantra, do it and experience relatively quickly.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; However, if =\r\none was merely initiated in Gayatri mantra (or\n&gt; any mantra) and did not re=\r\nally make much spiritual progress\n&gt; with it, that does not place one in any=\r\n kind of advantage\n&gt; when it comes to sadhana with another mantra. That is =\r\nmy\n&gt; opinion.\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; ---------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, F=\r\nree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish\n&gt; Writings,\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manua=\r\nls for short Homam\n&gt; and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; \n&gt;                   http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; \n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://Saraswati=\r\nFilms.org\n&gt; \n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm\n&gt; \n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; ---- Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Dr. Satya P=\r\nrakash, \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I do see your points and do understand that Sankar=\r\na\n&gt; peethams discourage the practise of mahavidyas without the\n&gt; Initiation=\r\n.

The only major point where I\n&gt; disagree is whether one can do Sri Sri Ch=\r\nandi path *without\n&gt; initiation*. The rest of the confusion on translation =\r\nof\n&gt; mantras needs some clarification as there seems to be some\n&gt; unnecessa=\r\nry confusion. A few pointers:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1.\tThere are various sacred ch=\r\nants embedded within the\n&gt; Vedas, Puranas, Agamas etc. Broadly speaking suc=\r\nh sacred\n&gt; chants can be categorised as mantras, stotras, kavachas,\n&gt; dhyan=\r\nams etc. Some stotras too are also treated as\n&gt; mahamantras and mantras.  T=\r\nhe Samhita portion of the Vedas\n&gt; too is referred to as mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; 2.\tUndoubtedly mantras and stotras have to be chanted\n&gt; in the origin=\r\nal. Reading a translation is not even\n&gt; comparable to chanting the original=\r\n chant. So far it is\n&gt; fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3.\tWhilst mantra, stotra and ka=\r\nvacha are all based on\n&gt; Sabda/Vak, tradition makes a distinction between t=\r\nhem.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;      \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4.\tAs per the traditional view one doesn&#39;t need to=\r\n\n&gt; be initiated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not\n&gt; the same wi=\r\nth most mantras. Mantras containing bijaksharas,\n&gt; agamic mantras, mantras =\r\nof Mahavidyas etc need initiation.\n&gt; This is the traditional view. Mantras =\r\nfrom the Veda Samhita\n&gt; are not the same as these other mantras that need\n&gt;=\r\n initiation, which are generally referred to as\n&gt; Agamic/Tantrik mantras. W=\r\nhatever you call these mantras the\n&gt; actual idea is that these mantras are =\r\nintegral parts of\n&gt; larger and distinct spiritual specialities that need\n&gt; =\r\ninitiation, as in the case of Mahavidyas such as Kali or\n&gt; Sri.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; 5.\tVishnusahasranama, Sivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam\n&gt; etc do not nee=\r\nd initiation as they fall under stotra\n&gt; category only. Lalitasahasranama a=\r\nnd Devi Mahatmyam are\n&gt; traditionally viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts=\r\n of\n&gt; puranas. They have a larger status as integral parts of a\n&gt; Mahavidya=\r\n sadhana. Chanting them without initiation is not\n&gt; recommended especially =\r\nwhen the reader combines the navarna\n&gt; or shodashi mantras too as an integr=\r\nal part of the\n&gt; chanting.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;            \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6.\tI know from persona=\r\nl interaction that acharyas\n&gt; belonging to both Kanchi as well as Sringeri =\r\nparamparas\n&gt; recommend initiation for both the sadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi\n&gt;=\r\n and Sri Vidya along with their respective NAVAKSHARI AND\n&gt; SHODASAKSHARI m=\r\nantras which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB\n&gt; (ANGA) of the sadhana. Achar=\r\nyas of both these traditions\n&gt; hold that one needs to be initiated to chant=\r\n the Navarna as\n&gt; well as shodashakshari mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 7.\tRecapp=\r\ning my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a\n&gt; great text that has an indepen=\r\ndent status by itself as part\n&gt; of a Mahavidya. It is simultaneously a Maha=\r\nvidya, a\n&gt; Yogasastra as well as an Advaitic text in the spirit of the\n&gt; Up=\r\nanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an integral\n&gt; part of Sri Sri=\r\n Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds that\n&gt; one needs to be initiated to c=\r\nhant it. However if one wishes\n&gt; to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or Sacred=\r\n myth aspects of\n&gt; the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in the\n&gt; v=\r\nernacular has been recommended in my write-up, as chanting\n&gt; the original a=\r\nlong with the navakshari  amounts to\n&gt; practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidy=\r\na. In that case it is\n&gt; recommended to be initiated and go through the spec=\r\nialised\n&gt; sadhanas properly under guidance.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 8.\tArguably if =\r\nan uninitiated person reads the Devi\n&gt; Mahatmyam in the original Sanskrit a=\r\ns part of the *Pauranik*\n&gt; approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an inher=\r\nent problem\n&gt; in our times.  The problem with attempting to do a parayana\n&gt;=\r\n of Devi Mahatmyam from texts alone (without initiation) is\n&gt; that most rea=\r\nders inadvertently end up also chanting the\n&gt; Navarna mantra or stotras suc=\r\nh as the Siddhakunjika stotram\n&gt; which too contain the bijaksharas.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 9.\tI you carefully peruse my write-up on the Devi\n&gt; Mahatmyam, for=\r\nget translating, nowhere do I put down the\n&gt; Navarna mantra even in writing=\r\n. Neither have I attempted to\n&gt; write a commentary on it. Translations of m=\r\nantras do not\n&gt; have the power of the original mantra as Sabda or Vak.\n&gt; Ho=\r\nwever it is recommended to know the essence or import\n&gt; (artha) of the mant=\r\nra and its sadhana while chanting it.\n&gt; Infact `artha&#39; is the import, the e=\r\nssence of `Vak&#39;,\n&gt; not a translation! \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; 10.\tFor those who are=\r\n already doing Sri Sri Chandi\n&gt; path without initiation, there is no need t=\r\no worry or be\n&gt; confused. There has to be a certain level of samskara to be=\r\n\n&gt; attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path itself. We all have it.\n&gt; Otherwise we =\r\nwould not be doing it (initiation or no\n&gt; initiation). Please keep doing wh=\r\natever you are doing. Just\n&gt; be cautious not to do sakama sadhana. As Naras=\r\nimha garu has\n&gt; rightly pointed out it is better to just do the sadhana\n&gt; W=\r\nITHOUT asking for any favours or results. That attitude\n&gt; itself will reduc=\r\ne a lot of the potential problem. Things\n&gt; will happen on their own accord =\r\nin the natural flow. Leave\n&gt; the rest to the compassionate Goddess.        =\r\n      \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hope the above pointers help in clearing any\n&gt; confus=\r\nion.  \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Satya Prakash                \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,\n&gt; h ram=\r\nalingam &lt;hramalingam@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; I want to share one anecdote happened in front of\n&gt; Kanchi Maha Sannidan=\r\nam Sri\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Chandrasekara Bharathi Swamigal\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When Swamigal =\r\nwas staying in a camp near Mysore\n&gt; in Karnataka One day all the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; l=\r\nearned persons male and female alike\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; requested Swamigal to transla=\r\nte Sri Vishnu\n&gt; SahasraNamam in kannada language\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; so that they can =\r\nchant knowing the meaning\n&gt; fully.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Swamigal didn&#39;t reply to this r=\r\nequest which\n&gt; was made early in the morning.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Later in the day aft=\r\ner the days pooja etc were\n&gt; over as usual Postman came to\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; camp to=\r\n deliver the posts came to Kanchi Mutt\n&gt; Swamigal.

That is\n=\r\n&gt; definitely the ideal situation.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If that is not poss=\r\nible, what I am saying is\n&gt; that reading something\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; composed by a=\r\nn elevated being even without\n&gt; understanding the meaning is very\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; useful. Suppose someone does not understand\n&gt; what Ganapathi Atharvaseers=\r\nham\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; means, thinks in general that it extols\n&gt; Ganapathi as the s=\r\nource of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything and chants it with a sense of\n&gt; surrender to=\r\n Ganapathi. One can\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still benefit immensely. If one is not\n&gt; exp=\r\neriencing anything, it is more\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; likely because one does not have =\r\nthe correct\n&gt; attitude and surrender and\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably not because on=\r\ne does know the\n&gt; specific meaning of Ganapathi\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Atharvaseersham.=\r\n Many people knowing the\n&gt; meaning and chanting may also\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experie=\r\nnce nothing.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The words uttered by a realized soul hav=\r\ne\n&gt; meanings at many layers and\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; literal meaning is only one supe=\r\nrficial\n&gt; layer. Some important layers are\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lost in translation. =\r\nThe most important\n&gt; layers of meaning are never\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understood inte=\r\nllectually, but only\n&gt; experienced internally.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whethe=\r\nr you know the meaning or not, chant\n&gt; the mantra with a calm and\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; relaxed mind and with devotion and\n&gt; surrender. Many people keep a target=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; count and race through it or do it\n&gt; mechanically with a sense =\r\nof duty. If it\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is done even with a little bit of love and\n&gt; surr=\r\nender to the deity, it can do\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something. The key to success with=\r\n a mantra\n&gt; is calmness of the mind. If a\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind is filled with th=\r\nousands of thoughts\n&gt; and chanting of the mantra is just\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one of =\r\nthose thousand activities, nothing\n&gt; will happen. If most thoughts\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; subside and mind is essentially\n&gt; reverberating with a mantra, that is w=\r\nhen\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one experiences a mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are 4 =\r\nlevels of sabda. When one says a\n&gt; mantra, physical vibration is\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n accompanied in other layers by the imagery\n&gt; in the mind, the thoughts and=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instincts in the conscious and sub-conscious\n&gt; mind etc. Some m=\r\nantras composed\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis\n&gt; (essent=\r\nially beings with very stable\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and calm minds) are designed such =\r\nthat the\n&gt; physical vibration of the mantra\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can eventually cause=\r\n the corresponding\n&gt; imagery in the mind by resonance,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when othe=\r\nr mental activity subsides. Thus,\n&gt; after repeating the mantra and\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; calming the mind down, you can recreate a\n&gt; certain imagery and thought =\r\nsystem\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in your mind. That can permanently alter the\n&gt; way your m=\r\nind workd. But the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; key is to attain a reasonably stable,\n&gt; focus=\r\ned and calm mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sant Dnyaneshwar&#39;s Marathi\n&gt; interp=\r\nretation of BhagavadGita and Sant\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tulsidas&#39;s Hindi compositions =\r\nhave a\n&gt; power of their own, as they were\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realized souls.

When I floated\n&gt;=\r\n the idea, Manish discouraged me.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He asked me, &quot;who do you think=\r\n you\n&gt; are?&quot; He said that it could be considered\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later, but firm=\r\nly told me to drop the idea\n&gt; for then.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please no=\r\nte that the goal of sadhana,\n&gt; such as homam, meditation, chanting\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; mantras and prayers, is NOT just an\n&gt; intellectual understanding of what=\r\n they\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mean. They are tools to silence the mind and\n&gt; channel its=\r\n energy. They are\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; storehouses of some shakti left by rishis,\n&gt; y=\r\nogis and sadhakas, who used them\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the past.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An intellectual understanding may help\n&gt; facilitate the right mood,=\r\n right\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frame of mind and right imagery. But, even\n&gt; without it, =\r\na mantra that was\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis\n&gt; hol=\r\nds power.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In fact, the words of a rishi that one\n=\r\n&gt; cannot intellectually understand\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can be more effective for spi=\r\nritual\n&gt; progress, than the words of a normal\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person that one ca=\r\nn intellectually\n&gt; understand and appreciate. So, I suggest\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not =\r\nworrying about whether one understands\n&gt; or not and reading Sanskrit\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; mantras coming from great\n&gt; rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I were to give an analogy in term=\r\ns\n&gt; of playing cricket, a batsman may\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; read a lot of scholarly an=\r\nalysis on how to\n&gt; play shots, how to see the ball\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the hand=\r\n of the bowler, how to move\n&gt; feet, how get into the line of the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n ball, how to play it with a straight bat,\n&gt; when to play front foot and wh=\r\nen\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to play back foot etc. But that does not\n&gt; necessarily make o=\r\nne a good\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; batsman. If one practices, THAT can make one\n&gt; a good =\r\nplayer. Of course, some\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; basic understanding of principles is nee=\r\nded.\n&gt; But, above that, practice is\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more important than bookish =\r\nknowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, some conceptual\n&gt; understan=\r\nding is important in spirituality\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also, but above that, sadhana =\r\nis more\n&gt; important.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The essence of all scripture=\r\ns, all\n&gt; mantras, all sadhanas, all paths is\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very simple. It is =\r\nthat we should overcome\n&gt; the notions that we are doing\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things a=\r\nnd realize that the divine acts\n&gt; through all of us. The divine acts\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; through each being based on one&#39;s\n&gt; conditioning and gives correspondi=\r\nng\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reactions. One goes through the cycle until\n&gt; one overcomes t=\r\nhe notions of &quot;I\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot;,\n&gt; &quot;I like this and I=\r\n dislike that&quot; etc. Though this\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is the essence of all scriptures=\r\n and one\n&gt; knows it, one may be deluded again\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and again. There i=\r\ns no magic formula to\n&gt; internalize this understanding fully\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and=\r\n overcome the instincts of &quot;I am\n&gt; doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, even if one practices a mantra that\n&gt; one does not intell=\r\nectually\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand, that is ok. As long as the basic\n&gt; essence =\r\nof scriptures is at the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back of one&#39;s mind, one is constantly\n&gt; =\r\ncontemplating and watching over one&#39;s\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; own thoughts and instincts=\r\n, to root out\n&gt; undesirable thoughts, one&#39;s sadhana\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will yield r=\r\nesults.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is w=\r\nhy I keep repeating the need\n&gt; of sadhana. It is fine to read\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sc=\r\nriptures and other books. It is fine to\n&gt; meet spiritual people (physically=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or virtually, like here) and discuss good\n&gt; things. But that wi=\r\nll only create\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a theoretical understanding. For it to be\n&gt; inter=\r\nnalized and to govern all of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actio=\r\nns,\n&gt; one needs to do sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One doing sadhana =\r\nwithout a basic\n&gt; theoretical understanding of what is\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what and =\r\nwhat we want, is like a blind\n&gt; person running around a mountain,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; instead of climbing it. One not doing\n&gt; sadhana, but having an excellent\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theoretical understanfing, is like a person\n&gt; who knows that he =\r\nneeds to climb\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mountain, but keeps staring at the\n&gt; pinnacle=\r\n instead of climbing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the statement that initiation\n&gt; is important in tantric p=\r\nath but\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2\n&gt; cents.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether Vedic and tantrik paths are two\n&gt; *distinct* paths=\r\n or parts of a\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continuum is debatable. There are a lot of\n&gt; inac=\r\ncurate notions today.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The issue is not really Tan=\r\ntrik vs\n&gt; Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s attitude and\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what one wants.=\r\n Anybody who wants specific\n&gt; material results needs to be\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caref=\r\nul regarding how to go about it.\n&gt; Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; particular result is not easy. It requires\n&gt; supervision of a good =\r\nguru and\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not many are left anyway. On the other hand,\n&gt; if one i=\r\ns NOT looking for\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific material results and is looking for\n&gt;=\r\n spiritual progress, the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constraints are fewer and options more.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some may sub-consciously have a notion\n&gt; that Ta=\r\nntrik path is for begetting\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific material results and Vedic =\r\npath is\n&gt; for self-realization. That is\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incorrect. After all, on=\r\ne in the Vedic path\n&gt; may chant Manyu sooktam for\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; victory in lit=\r\nigation or Ayushya sooktam for\n&gt; longevity, and so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly=\r\n, one in the Tantrik path may eat a\n&gt; gross substance in an elaborate\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ritual to reinforce the notion that\n&gt; &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and to remove =\r\nthe\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental repulsion towards some objects.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My thumbrule is this. If you are\n&gt; loo=\r\nking for a specific material result,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you need clear guidance and=\r\n supervision,\n&gt; which not many are capable of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; giving today! Inst=\r\nead, if you want spiritual\n&gt; progress and an increase of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your su=\r\nrrender, you can just keep doing\n&gt; sadhana without initiation or\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n guidance. Just keep company of scriptures\n&gt; and other like-minded people.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After all, if you want to go to\n&gt; Calcutta, you n=\r\need clear and precise\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; directions and some supervision. If you ju=\r\nst\n&gt; want to go to north pole, you\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can keep walking towards nort=\r\nh. Of course,\n&gt; having supervision helps there\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too, but you can =\r\ndo without it!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasim=\r\nha\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...\n&gt; &lt;vedic_p=\r\nathak%40yahoo.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste S=\r\natya Prakash Ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the\n&gt; n=\r\non-initiate to read in English or any\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;other regional language i=\r\ns because\n&gt; understanding the meaning and &gt;constant\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reflection a=\r\nre possible only when one\n&gt; repeatedly reads the &gt;text in a\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lang=\r\nuage that they can fully follow.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes Sir, if th=\r\nis is the reason\n&gt; then its understandable.

Since\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the last 4-5 years I =\r\nhave preferred to stay\n&gt; away from internet forums due to\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; variou=\r\ns reasons. It has been nearly a year\n&gt; since I interacted on an internet\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forum. However after Narasimha garu\n&gt; forwarded a copy of the orig=\r\ninal post\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with my write up to my inbox, I visited this\n&gt; forum a=\r\nnd quickly browsed\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through some posts. I am happy to note that\n&gt;=\r\n the general atmosphere here is\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; far better and more sincere than=\r\n a lot of\n&gt; other forums. Having quickly\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; browsed through this pa=\r\nrticular thread, I\n&gt; thought that I might reply to\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal ji&#39;s qu=\r\nestion.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Utp=\r\nal ji has raised an\n&gt; important question regarding the necessity\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n of initiation. I will address it after\n&gt; summarizing the big picture that\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; needs to be invoked in order to understand\n&gt; the ONE question an=\r\nd the MANY\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; answers possible. Firstly is the question a\n&gt; general=\r\n or specific one?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Generally speaking if the question is\n&gt; whethe=\r\nr initiation is an absolute\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; requirement for spiritual life or sa=\r\ndhana,\n&gt; *my* answer is- NO. However if\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the question is about th=\r\ne necessity of being\n&gt; initiated for mantra sadhana as\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enjoined =\r\nby *Tantra marga*, the answer is\n&gt; =C3=82?YES.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir\n&gt; bhinna&#39; as the tan=\r\ntric adage goes; thereby the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; necessity for multiple approaches a=\r\nnd\n&gt; multiple paths. Thus arises the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; inevitability of multiple p=\r\nerspectives. In\n&gt; the pan-Indian context there are\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; many paths fo=\r\nr sadhana. But in the current\n&gt; context of this question I will\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nrestrict myself to only the five that are\n&gt; relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga=\r\n\n&gt; (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga\n&gt; (Psy=\r\ncho-spiritual)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga\n&gt; (Tantric)\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga\n&gt; (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action-\n&gt; Ritual path and/or Selfles=\r\ns Actions)\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSpiritual life is\n&gt; nothing but the practicalisation of the great\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the\n&gt; above paths EMPHASISES parti=\r\ncular\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods and techniques in its attempt to\n&gt; practicalise th=\r\ne abstract truths at\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an experiential level. Let us briefly look\n=\r\n&gt; at the predominant methods/\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; techniques employed by each of the=\r\nse paths.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For those who are\n&gt; predominantly=\r\n oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; speaking even the external =\r\nguru is not\n&gt; necessary, though one can greatly\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; benefit from the=\r\n wisdom and experience of a\n&gt; genuine teacher. The direct path\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; o=\r\nf Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka\n&gt; (Discernment) and Vichara\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially\n&gt; a culmination of the =\r\nVaidik\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; system it has retained the vaidik practice\n&gt; of &#39;Swadhyay=\r\na&#39; (regular\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-study of texts) too as an important\n&gt; practice.=\r\n All of these practices\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with\n&gt; a=\r\n marginal role for external practices.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises\n&gt; Abhyasa (self-coaching =\r\nby consistent\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or\n&gt; Non-at=\r\ntachment). Hindu schools of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga additionally emphasise\n&gt; &#39;Iswar=\r\napranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Supreme Iswara) too =\r\nwhile Bauddha and\n&gt; Jina schools of Yogamarga\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emphasise only the=\r\n first two as they\n&gt; subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga\n&gt; (Love/Devotion) empha=\r\nsises unconditional acceptance of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Iswara&#39;s will through total su=\r\nrrender to\n&gt; the Supreme. On the contrary the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; emphasis in Karma =\r\nmarga is on Action as\n&gt; advocated by the Bhagavad Gita.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Engaging=\r\n in actions without attachment to\n&gt; the results is the mainstay of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Karma marga of the Gita.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will address\n&gt; the Tantric path of mantra sadhan=\r\na where\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alone the inevitable necessity of initiation\n&gt; and there=\r\nby the necessity of a\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the\n&gt;=\r\n practicalization of certain occult\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truths via the energetics of=\r\n Sabda through\n&gt; the employment of Vak. It\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; presupposes certain d=\r\nangers inherent to any\n&gt; lab experiment and thereby\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; certain regu=\r\nlations and safe practices. It\n&gt; should be remembered that except\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni\n&gt; at various levels, while Bh=\r\nakti\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; predominantly invokes Soma (the reference\n&gt; here is to the =\r\nage-old\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that\n&gt; invoke Agni, on=\r\ne path invokes/employs\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the fire of the intellect, another the fi=\r\nre\n&gt; of speech, another the fire of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; austerity, and yet another t=\r\nhe physical fire\n&gt; of the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of\n&gt; invoking fire deals w=\r\nith the fire of Vak through\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the lab-like practical mantrasastra.=\r\n Since\n&gt; Tantra employs highly powerful\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; techniques that bring re=\r\nsults more quickly\n&gt; it lays great emphasis on\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; adhikara. Adhikar=\r\na is not about authority\n&gt; but more about qualification.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Would y=\r\nou allow a child to experiment with\n&gt; fire without any supervision?\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Does the supervisor need experience and\n&gt; training or not? Like any oth=\r\ner lab\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiment proper training and experience\n&gt; are part of t=\r\nhe procedure apart\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from certain safety measures, in the Tantric\n=\r\n&gt; lab experiment too. However the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lab is one&#39;s own consciousness=\r\n whilst\n&gt; the experiment is awakening the Sakti\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; within the indiv=\r\nidual consciousness (also\n&gt; referred to as Kundalini Sakti).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As =\r\nthis is not a topic for mere\n&gt; intellectualisation, I will refrain from\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; further discussion on the Kundalini. Without\n&gt; going into other nee=\r\ndless\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; details here, I will just elaborate on\n&gt; initiation and Gu=\r\nru parampara.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Since we are talking\n&gt; about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it within the larger Tantric context too.\n&gt; Sakti sadhana is one m=\r\najor river\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha\n&gt; Vidyas c=\r\nover the entire Sakta\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhanas comprehensively. However there ar=\r\ne\n&gt; actually three major schools\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that are full-fledged living tr=\r\naditions\n&gt; among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Srikula and Tara=\r\nkula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana\n&gt; belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vi=\r\ndya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to\n&gt; make the picture more complete th=\r\ne\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have\n&gt; taken to Tarakula. T=\r\no those who are\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw\n&gt; att=\r\nention to the the 21 forms of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares bo=\r\nth the\n&gt; Advaitic outlook as well as the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sakta sadhanas in its a=\r\npproach to sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kali kula\n&gt; *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly\n&gt; invokes Soma, at lea=\r\nst at the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; major milestones in the internal spiritual\n&gt; journey. =\r\nThe yantra, mantra,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a\n=\r\n&gt; particular set of synchronistic\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; frequencies for each of these =\r\nthree\n&gt; lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; entry of the pr=\r\nactitioner into a particular\n&gt; spiritual lineage of that path\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (k=\r\nula). The Guru parampara can be compared\n&gt; to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; himself at the root from where the trunk\n&gt; arises. Each branch and=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sub-branches and twigs spread out\n&gt; progressively downward till=\r\n the individual\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you\n&gt; can=\r\n visualise it. Another modern\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; metaphor that one can use is that =\r\nof\n&gt; electricity. It is held by the Tantric\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; advocate that initia=\r\ntion not only completes\n&gt; the circuit necessary for the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; conduit =\r\nof electricity but also prevents\n&gt; short circuit. Imagine many\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; b=\r\neautiful\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bulbs/lights at each point in this\n&gt; inverted tree of=\r\n live wires, where\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; there is a long series of sadhakas sitting\n&gt; =\r\nin silent practice all the way up\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; till Siva himself. It is a dyn=\r\namic world of\n&gt; Light (Prakasa) and Sound\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (Sabda). Now back to S=\r\nri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta\n&gt; sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; individual consciousness through an\n&gt; integrated approach that combi=\r\nnes the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and\n&gt; Mantra. Bo=\r\nth Kalikula and\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Srikula have evolved into highly\n&gt; comprehensive=\r\n and integrated approaches\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that can simultaneously hold the many=\r\n in the\n&gt; One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; starts with the Pauranic=\r\n approach. However\n&gt; it is also a full-fledged\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Advaitic/Vedantic=\r\n text like the Upanishads.\n&gt; It is also simultaneously a text\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on=\r\n Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The\n&gt; question of initiation is\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; relevant only to those following the\n&gt; Tantramarga and thus employing =\r\nthe text\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a mantramaya text . For those who explore\n&gt; the text=\r\n as a yogasastra, the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; esoteric meaning is more relevant which I\n=\r\n&gt; have covered extensively in my\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; write-up. For those who are alr=\r\neady inclined\n&gt; to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chandi provides th=\r\ne context for immensely\n&gt; powerful reflections through its\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; centr=\r\nal message\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Oneness. The crest jewel, the\n&gt; crowning glory i=\r\nn the text is the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims\n&gt;=\r\n in full-fledged Upanishadic\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fashion that She is one without a s=\r\necond,\n&gt; saying &quot;I alone exist in this\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; universe. Who else is the=\r\nre besides\n&gt; me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the other\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mahavakyas o=\r\nf the Upanishads and reflect on\n&gt; the central truth of Advaita.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised t=\r\nhe\n&gt; non-initiate to read in English or any\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; other regional langu=\r\nage is because\n&gt; understanding the meaning and constant\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reflecti=\r\non are possible only when one\n&gt; repeatedly reads the text in a\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; l=\r\nanguage that they can fully follow. The\n&gt; main idea of the writeup is to\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic\n&gt; text too apart from it=\r\ns obvious\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri\n&gt; Chandi is als=\r\no equally regarded as\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially=\r\n\n&gt; the four hymns. In that regard\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; all the applications of Veda m=\r\nantras or the\n&gt; Veda Samhita are equally\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible with Sri Sri C=\r\nhandi and hence the\n&gt; practice of Chandi *HOMAM*.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Anyone who is =\r\nacquainted with the original\n&gt; Vedic method will straightaway\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; id=\r\nentify that Yagnya is the central Vedic\n&gt; practice. In fact even the worshi=\r\np\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully\n&gt; based on and DER=\r\nIVED from a one\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with\n&gt; the =\r\nHindu temple.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Just as some\n&gt; practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with the\n&gt; Vedic approach, there a=\r\nre those\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who adhere to the Tantric approach and do\n&gt; the sadhana=\r\n as per the mantra\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; marga. It is this particular approach that\n&gt; =\r\nneeds initiation as per its own\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; principles. Initiation is not ma=\r\nndatory if\n&gt; one adopts the Vedantic path of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Viveka and Vichara,=\r\n or the Yogic path of\n&gt; Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pauran=\r\nic approach of reading the text\n&gt; devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Homam too is not required if one is not\n&gt; inclined to the predominantly=\r\n Vaidik\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit\n&gt; from any or=\r\n all of these\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one\n&gt; has to=\r\n bear in mind that the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; living and breathing traditions of both\n&gt;=\r\n Kalikula as well as Srikula as\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; practiced originally in various =\r\nparts of the\n&gt; subcontinent originally trace\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; themselves to Tantr=\r\na marga and hence the\n&gt; importance of initiation for those\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; paths=\r\n, be it\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, one can make\n&gt; spiritual=\r\n progress through any of the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; merthods/practices using Sri Sri Ch=\r\nandi.\n&gt; Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, V=\r\nairagya, Nimitta\n&gt; bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are all effecti=\r\nve. However depending on the\n&gt; individual temperament, aptitude\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\netc., some of these methods are more suited\n&gt; relatively to different\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; practitioners. One may progress through a\n&gt; combination of any of the=\r\nse\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; methods in spiritual life. However the\n&gt; *full-fledged* integ=\r\nrated approach of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is\n&gt; t=\r\nhis big picture against which\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the answer to the question has to =\r\nbe\n&gt; contextualised.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally one last word.\n&gt; Irrespective of the method and path,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most\n&gt; effective methods for all of=\r\n us.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts\n&gt; followed by refl=\r\nection on the\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truths expounded in the texts. This is best\n&gt; done=\r\n in a language that one is\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fully conversant with. As for SATSANG=\r\nHA it\n&gt; is the FIRST AND BEST choice\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; among all methods. Swadhyay=\r\na is the\n&gt; alternate method (though not as\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; powerful) where Satsa=\r\nngha is not possible.\n&gt; It is Satsangha and satsangha\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; alone that=\r\n enables one to make rapid\n&gt; progress in spiritual life. Sri\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ram=\r\nakrishna attained the rare exalted state\n&gt; by virtue of serving, listening\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to and spending time in the company of\n&gt; sadhus and sants in his=\r\n younger days.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made\n&gt; a q=\r\nuantum leap in their\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual lives after they attended the\n&gt; S=\r\natsangha of Ramakrishna,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath\n&gt; respe=\r\nctively.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fo=\r\nr those who complain\n&gt; about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; will just quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE /=\r\n/ &quot;There is\n&gt; a complaint by householders nowadays that there\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ar=\r\ne no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse.\n&gt; The company of Sadhus is a\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; question of supply and demand. If there is a\n&gt; sincere demand, the =\r\nsupply will\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; come at once. This is the inexorable law of\n&gt; nature=\r\n. If you are really\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thirsty, you will find your Master at your\n&gt;=\r\n threshold. You lead a\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; happy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of=\r\n\n&gt; passion and unholy Vasanas. You do\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not care a bit for higher =\r\ndivine life. You\n&gt; waste your time in idle gossiping\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and vain, w=\r\norldly talks. You have become a\n&gt; hopeless slave of passion, greed,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I\n&gt; cannot get good Satsanga.=\r\n&#39;...\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first.\n&gt; Then come to me=\r\n. I shall take you\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will\n&gt;=\r\n put you in the right path, guide\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you and elevate you to sublime=\r\n heights.\n&gt; These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; waiting to get h=\r\nold of the right type of\n&gt; aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nReal seekers are few. If you bring a\n&gt; charge, &quot;There are no good\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a\n&gt; serious charge, &quot;There are no real see=\r\nkers\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain extent even\n&gt; this forum is an =\r\nopportunity for\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate\n&gt; bhav=\r\nana, this group too is a\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; potential Satsangha though not comparab=\r\nle to\n&gt; the actual company of the great\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; masters.

However, one without a=\r\n rich\n&gt; father is still better off\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; opening a bank account with a=\r\n zero balance\n&gt; and building it up slowly with\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s own hard wo=\r\nrk. Similarly, one not\n&gt; finding a guru can still do sadhana\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wit=\r\nh famous mantras and build one&#39;s own\n&gt; spiritual account. If you find a\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guru to initiate you (not as a formality,\n&gt; but truly initiate you)=\r\n, get\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; initiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do\n&gt; it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras=\r\n\n&gt; and rituals are used for two purposes - (i) for\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; getting speci=\r\nfic material results and (ii)\n&gt; as tools of increasing surrender\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n and making spiritual progress. In the case\n&gt; of (ii), initiation is not th=\r\nat\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important. But, in the case of (i), there\n&gt; are pitfalls and =\r\na guru can\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; prepare one sufficiently. One can get in\n&gt; trouble ot=\r\nherwise.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I\n&gt; said several times, there are very few people who\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has\n&gt; destabilized the whole system, =\r\nfor a\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing\n&gt; mantras and =\r\nrituals only for\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; increasing surrender, getting whatever\n&gt; materi=\r\nal results god wants to give\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and making spiritual progress. If o=\r\nne is\n&gt; meant to do rituals for begetting\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *specific* material re=\r\nsults (for oneself or\n&gt; others or society/universe in\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; general), =\r\nNature will make arrangements for\n&gt; one to get correct knowledge of\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; such rituals. But, as one starts, one should\n&gt; start with the attitude =\r\nof\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (ii).\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you\n&gt; want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ri=\r\ntual or\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; any homam, do it with the attitude of\n&gt; &quot;I have several =\r\nmaterial desires, but\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do not know how to fulfil them. Because =\r\nof\n&gt; this ritual, god may give any\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; material results or spiritual=\r\n results and\n&gt; not necessarily fulfil my desires.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I will accept =\r\nwhatever god gives. I want to\n&gt; increase my devotion and\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; surrend=\r\ner and make spiritual progress&quot;.\n&gt; You are then SAFE. Initiation is not\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; required. That attitude itself is an\n&gt; initiation!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle\n&gt; deitie=\r\ns give good results slowly, but there are\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fewer hiccups. Fierce =\r\ndeities give results\n&gt; fast, but there may be some\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hiccups. I ga=\r\nve this analogy earlier also.\n&gt; Imagine that a person is taking\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nrotten fruits from a fruit basket and\n&gt; throwing them in garbage and trying=\r\n to\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; retrieve one good fruit from under them. If\n&gt; the person is =\r\ngentle, one may do\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it gently and the spillage of rotten fruits\n&gt;=\r\n on the floor will be minimal. If\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the person is aggressive, one =\r\nmay do it fast\n&gt; and there may be more spillage\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of rotten fruits=\r\n on the floor. But the good\n&gt; fruit stuck under the rotten\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fruit=\r\ns will be retrieved faster. Similarly,\n&gt; phala of your karmas is in a\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; basket. The deity is trying to take bad\n&gt; fruits and throw them in ga=\r\nrbage and\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give you a good fruit to eat. There may be\n&gt; some spil=\r\nlage. A gentle deity\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take\n=\r\n&gt; more time to get out the good\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fruit, but the spillage will be =\r\nminimal. A\n&gt; fierce deity like Chandi or\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhairava or Kali or N=\r\narasimha may have\n&gt; more spillage, but the good fruit\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes out =\r\nfaster.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; At the end,\n&gt; remember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cr=\r\neations, but fruits of your own actions.\n&gt; Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve ha=\r\nd\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to eat each of those rotten fruits before\n&gt; eating the good fr=\r\nuits!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Nevertheless,\n&gt; one unable to take some of the spillage of rotten\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; fruits is better off avoiding fierce deities\n&gt; such as Chandi and stay=\r\ning with\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gentler deities. If initiation if made\n&gt; mandatory, one=\r\n can be assessed by a\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guru before starting a practice. If you\n&gt; =\r\nrealize the above, you can start\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras without initiation. If =\r\nsome bad\n&gt; results occut, you have to realize\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it is a fruit=\r\n of your own actions and\n&gt; the deity is trying to accelerate\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; goo=\r\nd results. If you are weak-hearted, stick\n&gt; to gentler deities.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some\n&gt; peo=\r\nple who never lit a lamp in their life and were\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ignorant of ritu=\r\nals, are doing daily homam\n&gt; now. Some people who took several\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; h=\r\nours to read Saptashati for the first time\n&gt; just 2-3 years back are now\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing Chandi homam with entire saptashati\n&gt; everyday. I know that =\r\nsome of them\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have transformed a lot and have experienced\n&gt; some =\r\nthings too. Obviously, they\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have done sadhana with fire and sadh=\r\nana of\n&gt; the Fierce aspects of Divine\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mother in some past lives.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6=\r\n) In this\n&gt; age of ignorance and rank materialism, if someone\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ha=\r\ns even a faint idea that spiritual\n&gt; progress is important, is looking for\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; god and is attracted to a specific advanced\n&gt; sadhana (e.g. Chan=\r\ndipath), that\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person obviously has some good karmas and\n&gt; good v=\r\nasanas. That person has done\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that sadhana in the past. Previous\n=\r\n&gt; life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If you\n&gt; have a good understand=\r\ning of what is what, how\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things work, why one should do somethin=\r\ng,\n&gt; how to do it, what is more\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; important and what is less impor=\r\ntant, that\n&gt; is what initiation is all about!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;      \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;     \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n"}}
