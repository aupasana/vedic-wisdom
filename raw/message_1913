The flowers can be used as a source of yellow dye for clothing. The f=\r\nlower is the official flower of the state of West Bengal, India , and for K=\r\nanchanaburi Province, Thailand . \nMythology\nParijat appears in several Hind=\r\nu myths. In one myth, which appears in Srimad Bhagavatam, the Mahabharata a=\r\nnd the Vishnu Purana, Parijat appeared as the result of the Samudra manthan=\r\n (Churning of the Milky Ocean). In another myth,\n=A0\n=A0\nOnce a royal princ=\r\ness fell in love with the sun god-Surya Dev. She was enamored of his brilli=\r\nance and beauty as he daily passed through the sky from east to west in his=\r\n fiery chariot. Her devotion attracted his attention and for a while he fav=\r\nored her with his attention but after awhile he was distracted with other i=\r\nnterests and she was deserted. In despair she killed herself and from her c=\r\nremated ashes the parijatak tree arose. Since she was rejected by Surya Dev=\r\n, the flowers of the tree only bloom at night. Then before the sun rises th=\r\ne flowers fall so its rays will not strike her. Based on this story the tre=\r\ne was given the species name =EBarbortristis=ED which means =EBtree of sorr=\r\now=ED \n=A0 \nAnother story surrounding the trees=ED origin is found in sever=\r\nal ancient Indian scriptures called the Puranas. It is said that when the c=\r\nelestial beings, at the behest of Hari-the Preserver of the Universe, churn=\r\ned the cosmic ocean to obtain certain boons that would help alleviate suffe=\r\nring and protect the powers of good from the powers of evil one of the pari=\r\njatak tree appeared as one of the divine treasures. Its perfume was said to=\r\n permeate the entire universe. Because the tree holds such a elevated place=\r\n in India=EDs sacred lore, the tree is revered by devote Hindus. The story,=\r\n on one level, clearly illustrates that trees, flowers and fragrance repres=\r\nent some of the finest boons for humankind. \n=A0 \nAfter the parijatak tree =\r\nemerged from the ocean of existence it taken to the heaven worlds and plant=\r\ned in the pleasure garden of Indra- the lord of the gods. One day a great s=\r\nage of ancient times named Narad Muni visited this garden in his meditation=\r\ns visited this garden and saw this lovely tree emitting its divine perfume.=\r\n Using his yogic powers he gathered up some of these ethereal blossoms and =\r\nbrought them back to the physical plane and gave them to Rukmini, the favor=\r\nite wife of the renowned avatar of Vishnu, Lord Krishna, who was at that ti=\r\nme dwelling in Dwaraka in north India . The flowers were so lovely and the =\r\nfragrance so delicate that Satyabhama another wife of Lord Krishna became d=\r\nesirous of possessing that celestial tree and having it planted in her own =\r\ngarden. She was jealous of the attention Krishna was showing to Rukmini and=\r\n wanted him to give more time to her. She implored him to obtain the tree f=\r\nor her. To satisfy her desire he entered\n into a state of deep meditation a=\r\nnd in that state plucked up the tree from the garden. Before leaving that p=\r\nlace he was accosted by the keepers of the garden and was told he would inc=\r\nur the wrath of Indra as the tree belonged to his wife Sachi.. But Satyabha=\r\nma would not be put off by any obstacle and said that the tree was the comm=\r\non property of all and had as much place on earth as it had in the heavens.=\r\n As a result Krishna waged a great war with Indra and his celestial army. I=\r\nn the end Krishna=EDs strength prevailed and Indra was forced to retreat. A=\r\nt that time Satyabhama taunted him as being a coward but decided to give ba=\r\nck his celestial tree. Krishna also consented to return the tree to its cel=\r\nestial abode. But Indra said that there was no shame in being defeated by t=\r\nhe avatar of Vishnu and that the tree should be taken to earth and planted =\r\nin Dwarka where its fragrance could be enjoined by all the people of the ea=\r\nrth. Thus the first parijatak tree\n was planted and its divine fragrance wa=\r\ns said to spread for three furlongs. Its aroma was charged with so much pow=\r\ner that it would help people enhaling it to remember events of their past l=\r\nives. In this instance also we can see that the sages were explaining to th=\r\ne people that fragrance was a valuable means of accessing stored memories. =\r\nIn the East memory has a much more comprehensive meaning than in the West a=\r\ns it can include past lives as it is believed that the soul takes countless=\r\n births on its journey to perfection but the same basic principal is explai=\r\nned in this story as is encountered in western literature regarding how fra=\r\ngrance stimulates memories of past events in ones life. \n=A0 \n=A0Medicinal =\r\n \n\nThe fresh leaves of the plant prepared in the form of juice, infusions o=\r\nr decoctions and in combination with other herbs are found to be useful in =\r\ntreating inflamations, sciatica, pruritis(itching) fever, bronchitis, asthm=\r\na, cough, dyspepsia(difficult y with digestion associated with pain, flautu=\r\nlence, heartburn and nausea), constipation as the active principals contain=\r\ned within them are found to have anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, digesti=\r\nve, expectorant, sudorific, diurectic and laxative properites. The leaves w=\r\nere also considered antidotal for reptile venom.Various preparations of the=\r\n fresh flowers were found useful in treating diseases like colic, dyspepsia=\r\n, flatulence, greyness of hair and balness as they wer astringent, stomachi=\r\nc, and carminative in nature. The bark when chewed with betelnut and leaf w=\r\nas eaten to promote expectoration of thick phlem. The seeds when powdered a=\r\nnd prepared as a paste are used to cure scurvy and affections of the\n scalp=\r\n.  \n\n\n      Cricket on your mind? Visit the ultimate cricket website.

Her devotion att=\r\nracted his attention and for a while he favored her with his attention but =\r\nafter awhile he was distracted with other interests and she was deserted. I=\r\nn despair she killed herself and from her cremated ashes the parijatak tree=\r\n arose. Since she was rejected by Surya Dev, the flowers of the tree only b=\r\nloom at night. Then before the sun rises the flowers fall so its rays will =\r\nnot strike her.

It is said =\r\nthat when the celestial beings, at the behest of Hari-the Preserver of the =\r\nUniverse, churned the cosmic ocean to obtain certain boons that would help =\r\nalleviate suffering and protect the powers of good from the powers of evil =\r\none of the parijatak tree appeared as one of the divine treasures. Its perf=\r\nume was said to permeate the entire universe. Because the tree holds such a=\r\n elevated place in India=EDs sacred lore, the tree is revered by devote Hin=\r\ndus. The story, on one level, clearly illustrates that trees, flowers and f=\r\nragrance represent some of the finest boons for humankind. &lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;P class=\r\n=3DMsoNormal style=3D&quot;BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; B=\r\nORDER-LEFT: medium none; DIRECTION: ltr; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; unicod=\r\ne-bidi: embed; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;verdana, helvetica, sans-=\r\nserif&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;P class=3DMsoNormal style=3D&quot;BORDER-RIGHT: medium no=\r\nne; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; DIRECTION: ltr; BORD=\r\nER-BOTTOM: medium none; unicode-bidi: embed; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;verdana, helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;After the parijatak tree emerged from =\r\nthe ocean of existence it taken to the heaven worlds and planted in the ple=\r\nasure garden of Indra- the lord of the gods. One day a great sage of ancien=\r\nt times named Narad Muni visited this garden in his meditations visited thi=\r\ns garden and saw this lovely tree emitting its divine perfume. Using his yo=\r\ngic powers he gathered up some of these ethereal blossoms and brought them =\r\nback to the physical plane and gave them to Rukmini, the favorite wife of t=\r\nhe renowned avatar of Vishnu, Lord Krishna, who was at that time dwelling i=\r\nn Dwaraka in north India . The flowers were so lovely and the fragrance so =\r\ndelicate that Satyabhama another wife of Lord Krishna became desirous of po=\r\nssessing that\n celestial tree and having it planted in her own garden. She =\r\nwas jealous of the attention Krishna was showing to Rukmini and wanted him =\r\nto give more time to her. She implored him to obtain the tree for her. To s=\r\natisfy her desire he entered into a state of deep meditation and in that st=\r\nate plucked up the tree from the garden. Before leaving that place he was a=\r\nccosted by the keepers of the garden and was told he would incur the wrath =\r\nof Indra as the tree belonged to his wife Sachi.. But Satyabhama would not =\r\nbe put off by any obstacle and said that the tree was the common property o=\r\nf all and had as much place on earth as it had in the heavens. As a result =\r\nKrishna waged a great war with Indra and his celestial army. In the end Kri=\r\nshna=EDs strength prevailed and Indra was forced to retreat. At that time S=\r\natyabhama taunted him as being a coward but decided to give back his celest=\r\nial tree. Krishna also consented to return the tree to its celestial abode.=\r\n But\n Indra said that there was no shame in being defeated by the avatar of=\r\n Vishnu and that the tree should be taken to earth and planted in Dwarka wh=\r\nere its fragrance could be enjoined by all the people of the earth. Thus th=\r\ne first parijatak tree was planted and its divine fragrance was said to spr=\r\nead for three furlongs. Its aroma was charged with so much power that it wo=\r\nuld help people enhaling it to remember events of their past lives. In this=\r\n instance also we can see that the sages were explaining to the people that=\r\n fragrance was a valuable means of accessing stored memories. In the East m=\r\nemory has a much more comprehensive meaning than in the West as it can incl=\r\nude past lives as it is believed that the soul takes countless births on it=\r\ns journey to perfection but the same basic principal is explained in this s=\r\ntory as is encountered in western literature regarding how fragrance stimul=\r\nates memories of past events in ones life. &lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;P class=3DMsoNormal sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medi=\r\num none; DIRECTION: ltr; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; unicode-bidi: embed; T=\r\nEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;verdana, helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;\n&lt;P class=3DMsoNormal style=3D&quot;BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: =\r\nmedium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; DIRECTION: ltr; BORDER-BOTTOM: mediu=\r\nm none; unicode-bidi: embed; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;verdana, helvetica, sans-serif&quot; size=3D2=\r\n&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#7f3f00&gt;&nbsp;Medicinal&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FON=\r\nT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;P class=3DMsoNormal style=3D&quot;BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-T=\r\nOP: medium none; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; DIRECTION: ltr; BORDER-BOTTOM: m=\r\nedium none; unicode-bidi: embed; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT =\r\nface=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;verdana, helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT size=3D2&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt&quot;&gt;&lt;IMG src=3D&quot;http://farm4.stati=\r\nc.flickr.com/3167/2718714265_05b7469f40_t.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;P cl=\r\nass=3DMsoNormal style=3D&quot;BORDER-RIGHT: medium none; BORDER-TOP: medium none=\r\n; BORDER-LEFT: medium none; DIRECTION: ltr; BORDER-BOTTOM: medium none; uni=\r\ncode-bidi: embed; TEXT-ALIGN: justify&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 13.5pt&quot;&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;verdana, helvetica, sans-serif&quot; size=3D2&gt;The fresh l=\r\neaves of the plant prepared in the form of juice, infusions or decoctions a=\r\nnd in combination with other herbs are found to be useful in treating infla=\r\nmations, sciatica, pruritis(itching) fever, bronchitis, asthma, cough, dysp=\r\nepsia(difficult y with digestion associated with pain, flautulence, heartbu=\r\nrn and nausea), constipation as the active principals contained within them=\r\n are found to have anti-bacterial, anti-inflammatory, digestive, expectoran=\r\nt, sudorific, diurectic and laxative properites.
