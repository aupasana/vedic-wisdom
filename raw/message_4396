Does i=\r\nt do so? For example,does a cow\nmoving in front of you say that she is movi=\r\nng? Or do you say of your own\naccord =93There is a cow moving=94? The objec=\r\nts exist because of the seer\ncognising them.\n\nD.: Gaudapada in Mandukya Kar=\r\nikas says that there is no difference between\nthe two states from the stand=\r\npoint of Reality-Absolute.\n\nM.: Of course not.\n\nD.: I believe Bhagavan also=\r\n says so. Prof. Radhakrishnan in his Indian\nPhilosophy says that in his Bra=\r\nhma Sutra Commentary Sri Sankara makes a\ndistinction between the two states=\r\n. Is it a fact? If so, what is it? How can\nthere be any distinction from th=\r\ne viewpoint of reality? So long as the mind\nexists in any form there will b=\r\ne distinction.But from the standpoint of\nAtman, non-dual Brahman, can there=\r\n be any distinction?\n\nM.: The dream is for the one who says that he is awak=\r\ne. In fact,wakefulness\nand dream are equally unreal from the standpoint of =\r\nthe Absolute.\n\nD.: The dream world is not purposeful as the jagrat world, b=\r\necause we do not\nfeel that wants are satisfied.\n\nM.: You are not right. The=\r\nre are thirst and hunger in dream also. You might\nhave had your fill and ke=\r\npt over the remaining food for the next day.\nNevertheless you feel hungry i=\r\nn dream. This food does not help you. Your\ndream-hunger can be satisfied on=\r\nly by eating dream-food. Dream-wants are\nsatisfied by dream-creations only.=\r\n\n\nD.: We recollect our dreams in our jagrat but not vice-versa.\n\nM.: Not ri=\r\nght again. In the dream you identify yourself with the one now\nspeaking.\n\nD=\r\n.: But we do not know that we are dreaming as apart from waking as we do\nno=\r\nw.\n\nM.: The dream is the combination of jagrat(waking state) and sushupti(D=\r\neep\ndreamless sleep). It is due to the samskaras of the jagrat state. Hence=\r\n we\nremember dreams at present. Samskaras are not formed contrariwise; ther=\r\nefore\nalso we are not aware of the dream and jagrat simultaneously. Still e=\r\nveryone\nwill recollect strange perplexities in dream. One wonders if he dre=\r\nams or is\nawake. He argues and determines that he is only awake. When reall=\r\ny awake, he\nfinds that it was all only a dream.\n\nD : Is it a fact that drea=\r\nms arise because of the impressions received\nduring the waking state?\n\nA. N=\r\no,it is not true.In your dream you see many new things and many new\npeople =\r\nwhom you have never seen before in your walking state.You may even\nsee a se=\r\ncond dream within the dream.After waking up from the second\ndream,you feel =\r\nthat you have woken up,but that is the waking state of the\nfirst dream.In t=\r\nhe same way,man wakes up daily,but it is not to a real\nwaking state.\n\n\nSour=\r\nces:\n\n1) Ramana Maharshi&#39;s introduction and teachings By Swami Rama Thirtha=\r\n\nOriginal in Gujarathi\n2) Arunchala&#39;s Ramana Volume VI Book\n\nSource: Talks =\r\nWith Ramana Maharshi Book\n*\n\r\n--0016e6d26d8b9e45000487a2719a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;font color=3D&quot;#333333&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nb&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-weight:normal;=\r\nfont-size:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;15th April, l937&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;T=\r\nalk 399.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr. Bose, the Bengali Engineer, has since read Gauda=\r\npada Karikas and Sir S.
