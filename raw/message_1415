In fact, even if the original expert recorded it mechanically and with=\r\nout much devotion, you will still get good punya from it if you listen to i=\r\nt with focus and devotion.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The purpose of mantra is to control the mi=\r\nnd and its thoughts and tap some spiritual energy that the mind has access =\r\nto but does not get because of its various pre-occupations. If you hear som=\r\nething with focus, it still helps in controlling the mind, tapping some spi=\r\nritual energy. It is still beneficial.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, as you become comfort=\r\nable with it, try to chant it yourself at some stage. That is a little bett=\r\ner.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (2) Yes. As you hear, a part of your mind is repeating that sound=\r\n while you do the actions. It will still be beneficial. In fact, I know tha=\r\nt some people who are now doing homam quite well started out in that manner=\r\n!\n&gt;  \n&gt; (3) You will benefit mainly. But various people who enabled you wil=\r\nl also get some small portions of it. But most of the benefit for this spec=\r\nific action is yours.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comca=\r\nst.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =\r\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Hello PV=\r\nR gaaru: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have couple of dumb questions; please don&#39;t laugh get =\r\na chance can \n&gt; &gt; you please clarify the same for me, hope I&#39;m not misusing=\r\n the group \n&gt; &gt; with my silly questions: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1.\tWill there be any eff=\r\nect of playing Audio Mantras read/rendered \n&gt; &gt; by experts? (as layman like=\r\n me, who do not know how to pronounce the \n&gt; &gt; Sanskrit mantras correctly, =\r\nis it OK to take help of the CD&#39;s or Audio \n&gt; &gt; MP3 mantras available?). \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; 2.\tYou have provided Audio and Video of Ganapathi Homam, will \n&gt; &gt; there=\r\n be the same effect if one plays and mimic (imitating the actions \n&gt; &gt; with=\r\nout any self voice and your original voice in place)? \n&gt; &gt; 3.\tIf the answer=\r\ns to the above is `Yes&#39;, who will get benefitted \n&gt; &gt; (I mean will I get be=\r\nnefited or the originators who rendered the \n&gt; &gt; mantras or performed Homam=\r\n?)\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
