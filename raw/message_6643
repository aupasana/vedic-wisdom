Simpler of the 2 is to Hold Coc=\r\nonut half between two palms and apply enough pressure so that it&#39;ll break i=\r\nn to 4 pieces of adequate size.\nOr 2ndly (for relatively smaller coconut ha=\r\nlves) just hold the dry half from both sides and apply shearing pressure. I=\r\n mean pull it to create 2 pieces. this will give you 2 bigger pieces but th=\r\ne advantage is that that will burn well and quickly because of more hollow =\r\nspace it&#39;ll have (Its difficult for me to explain this).\n\n***\n\nKeep appx 2 =\r\nCoconut pieces at the edge of Burning camphor and see to it that it catches=\r\n fire adequately. too much ghee is not required.\n\nHowever all of these with=\r\n come with experience automatically.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal \n\n\n--- In vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vsra_prasad&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; For the =\r\nlast 3 days I have been doing the same, never used aluminium foil and am no=\r\nt planning to use also.

The d=\r\nry coconuts were not catching fire (unlike the twigs I used the last 2 days=\r\n) and the fire went off twice before I put camphor to reignite. \n&gt; Anyways,=\r\n I am planning to do the homam in the weekends only unless I get to know ho=\r\nw I can manage sandhyavandanam along with homam ! \n&gt; Previously I was able =\r\nto do Gayatri mantra and HareKrsna mahamantra in 90 mins or 100 mins and th=\r\nat was all completely mantras.\n&gt; Then, I started sandhya vandanam along wit=\r\nh Harekrsna mahamantra and my mahamantra numbers came down to accommodate t=\r\nhe rituals of sandhya vandanam.\n&gt; Today (unliked the weekend where I took m=\r\nore than 2 hours), I realized neither I have done sandhya vandanam properly=\r\n nor the homam properly to accommodate both of them.

I would like to suggest from my own method which may=\r\n help you bring down 20 minutes to 10Min.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) First of all, It is a=\r\ndvisable to avoid Aluminum Foil. Aluminum foil cutting for correct size and=\r\n then adjusting on Homa kundam takes a good amount of time. I did it for so=\r\nme 6 months initially and then there was a Message from Narasimha that it i=\r\ns better to avoid Aluminum foil because Aluminum being a relatively modern =\r\nmetal and may carry Rahu&#39;s predominance. I stopped foil since then...\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; 2) No need to wash Homa Kundam every day. I do it once in a month or so=\r\n. Let it be black and dark.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If the above 2 points are observed, i=\r\nt can save some 5 to 7 minutes easily.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Now, one can do following a=\r\nrrangements previous nights (the people who do Homa in the morning)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; -Empty the Homa Kundam and keep it clean (Tissue papers are very handy fo=\r\nr this) and ready for next morning\n&gt; &gt; - Keep the Dry Coconut pieces or Woo=\r\nd ready.\n&gt; &gt; - Keep the Lamp ready with Wick\n&gt; &gt; - Keep Camphor, Rice mixed=\r\n with ghee and turmeric, Flowers,  etc... ready. (I do not use flowers any =\r\nmore. Use Akshatas mixed with Turmeric as flowers..Bhagwan ko bolta hun Bha=\r\nvnaO ko Samjho! Phul ki jagape Chawal se kaam chalalo:-)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So when I=\r\n get ready for Homam, I just have to fill up the copper tumbler with water =\r\nand heat up the ghee and few other such activities which takes around 5to7 =\r\nMinutes in total.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Before i forget i must remind that there is no n=\r\need to keep the Darbha in 4 directions every time.

I am also one of tho=\r\nse people who, because of guilt factor of skipping sandhyavandana, unable t=\r\no do the homa daily. I do it every week.

Someone I respect, mentioned of AupAsana homam ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the past, I have asked exactly the same question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If=\r\n you are not already doing sandhyAvandana and aupAsana (and are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing=\r\n homa), don&#39;t worry about it. Just skip this mail altogether. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you =\r\nare doing sandhyAvandana, don&#39;t want to stop doing it (because of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\n guilt factor), and want to better integrate it with homa, this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mail =\r\nmay be of some limited value. I have studied several\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sandhyAvandana, =\r\naupAsana and homa manuals.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Many traditions split sandhyAvandan=\r\na into two parts: (a) purificatory\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rites and (b) gAyatri-japa. If you=\r\n want to integrate with homa, do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; homa between parts (a) and (b). The =\r\nfirst part, with the mArjana etc\n&gt; &gt; &gt; hardly takes 1-2 minutes. After that=\r\n, do the homa. After the purnahuti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc, you can do the second part of=\r\n sandhyAvandana (gayatri japa)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; starting with the AvAhana. Spend as mu=\r\nch time in this meditation as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you can. Then, you can do the upasthAna=\r\n etc, which will add another 2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; minutes or so. Consider skipping all t=\r\nhe elaborate nyAsas, and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; repeated prAnAyAmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Really=\r\n speaking, everything important is already there in the homa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manual. =\r\nFrom the &quot;full sandhyAvandana&quot; procedure, you can pull in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; few veda =\r\nmantras if you choose to. But, it really isn&#39;t necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If y=\r\nou look at aupAsana procedures, you will find that Narasimha&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; manual=\r\n is more elaborate than the aupAsana. Homa is basically a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; superset of=\r\n aupAsana. Where the manual differs, it is more relevant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for our mode=\r\nrn lifestyle, and you don&#39;t need to add anything to it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Frankly, I ba=\r\nsically follow Narasimha&#39;s manual, but say &quot;aupAsana&quot; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the sankalpa=\r\n. They are that similar. The fire in which you do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;upAsana&quot; is &quot;aupAs=\r\nana&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ajit\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
