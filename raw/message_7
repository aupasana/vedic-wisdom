I am just wondering if you =\r\nknew \nthe following:\n\nISKCONs belief is that the Supreme Brahman certainly =\r\nexists but it is \nthe effulgence from Lord Krsna. Just like the sunshine co=\r\nmes from the \nsun globe. \n\nIt is argued that the origin must be full of for=\r\nm. As we can perceive \nthings that originate from the origin as having form=\r\n. Therefore the \norigin cannot be any less than what originates from it. \n\n=\r\nSomething can be spiritual and still have form. But spiritual form is \nnot =\r\nperceivable to our material eyes.\n\nI wonder what you think of this.\n\nIt may=\r\n be useful for you to read more deeply into the ISKCON \nphilosphy. I can pr=\r\novide links to the Caitanya Caritamrta, Srimad \nBhagvatam, Bhagvad Gita if =\r\nyou are interested.\n\nYours benevolently\n\nKasim\n\n\n\n\n"}}
