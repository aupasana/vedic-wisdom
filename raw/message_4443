Who but he, does this day, abiding as the inmost Self =\r\nin me, speak\nthis in the Tamil language?=E2=80=99 =E2=80=94 Sri Bhagavan\n\n1=\r\n. This =E2=80=94 Atma Bodha =E2=80=94 is meant to fulfil the want of the se=\r\nekers of\nliberation who, by their prolonged tapas, have already cleansed th=\r\nemselves\nof impurities and become mentally peaceful and free from desires.\n=\r\n\n2. Of all the means to liberation, knowledge is the only direct one =E2=80=\r\n=94 as\nessential as fire to cooking; without it, liberation cannot be gaine=\r\nd.\n\n3. Not being opposed to ignorance, karma does not destroy it. On the ot=\r\nher\nhand, knowledge destroys ignorance as surely as light does darkness.\n\n4=\r\n. Owing to ignorance, the Self now appears to be covered up; on the removal=\r\n\nof ignorance, the pure Self will shine forth of Itself, like the sun after=\r\n\nthe dispersal of clouds.\n\n5. The jiva is mixed up with ignorance. By const=\r\nant practice of knowledge\nthe jiva becomes pure, because knowledge disappea=\r\nrs (along with ignorance),\nas the cleansing nut with the impurities in the =\r\nwater.But here is the world,\nhow can the Self alone be real and non-dual?\n\n=\r\n6. Samsara is full of likes and dislikes and other opposites. Like a dream,=\r\n\nit seems real for the time being; but, on waking, it vanishes because it i=\r\ns\nunreal.\n\nBecause the dream is negated on waking, I know it to be unreal; =\r\nbut the\nworld persists and I find it only real.\n\n7. So long as the substrat=\r\num of all, the non-dual Brahman is not seen, the\nworld seems real =E2=80=94=\r\n like illusory silver in a piece of mother-of-pearl.But\nthe world is so div=\r\nerse; yet, you say there is One only.\n\n8. Like bubbles rising on the surfac=\r\ne of the waters of the ocean, all the\nworlds arise from, stay in and resolv=\r\ne into the Supreme Being (Paramesa) who\nis the root cause and prop of all.\n=\r\n\n9. In the Being-Consciousness-Bliss, which is all permeating, eternal\nVish=\r\nnu, all these diverse objects and individuals appear (as phenomena) like\nva=\r\nrious ornaments made of gold.Yes, but what about the numberless individual\n=\r\nsouls?\n\n10. Just as the all-pervading akasa (ether) appears fragmented in d=\r\nifferent\nobjects (as in a pit, a jar, a house, a theatre hall, etc.) but re=\r\nmains\nundifferentiated on the limitations falling away, similarly with the =\r\nsingle,\nnon-dual ruler of the senses (seeming to function as gods, men, cat=\r\ntle,\netc.). But the individuals have different traits and function accordin=\r\ng to\ndifferent conditions.\n\n11. The traits, etc., are also superimposed. Pu=\r\nre water (tasteless by\nitself) tastes sweet, bitter, salty etc., according =\r\nto the admixture in it\n(upadhis). Similarly, race, name status, etc., are a=\r\nll superimposed on the\nnon-dual Self of all. What are these upadhis which p=\r\nlay such tricks on the\nSelf? They are gross, subtle and very subtle as desc=\r\nribed here.\n\n12. The gross body made up of the five gross elements (earth, =\r\nwater, fire,\nair and ether) is meant to reap the fruits of past actions in =\r\nthe shape of\npleasure and pain.\n\n13. The subtle body consisting of the five=\r\n airs, the mind,intellect, the ten\nsenses and made up of subtle elements is=\r\n also meant for enjoyment (as in\ndreams).\n\n14. Inexpressible and beginningl=\r\ness ignorance is said to be the causal body\n(as in deep sleep). Know the Se=\r\nlf to be other than these three upadhis.\n\nIf so, why is the Self not eviden=\r\nt to me? On the other hand, Sruti says,\n=E2=80=98This Purusha is made up of=\r\n annarasa (essence of food).=E2=80=99\n\n15. Just as a clear crystal (itself =\r\ncolourless) appears red,blue, yellow,\netc., according to the background, so=\r\n also the Self, pure and untainted,\nseems to be identical with the body,the=\r\n senses, the mind, intellect or\nblissful ignorance (panchakosas) when in co=\r\nntact with them.\n\n16. Just as husking the paddy exposes the grain within (t=\r\nhe rice), so also\nshould one judiciously separate the pure Atman from the s=\r\nheaths covering it.\n\nAtman is said to be everywhere. Why should it then be =\r\njudiciously looked for\nwithin the five sheaths?\n\n17. Though always and ever=\r\nywhere present, the Self does not shine forth in\nall places. Just as light =\r\nis reflected only in a transparent medium, so also\nthe Self is clearly seen=\r\n in the intellect only.\n\n18. The Self is realized in the intellect as the w=\r\nitness of the activities\nof, and yet separate from the body, the senses, th=\r\ne mind, intellect and\ngross nature (prakriti) as is a king in relation to h=\r\nis subjects.\n\nThe Self seems to participate in their activities; so he cann=\r\not be different\nfrom them, nor be their witness.\n\n19. Just as the moon seem=\r\ns to move when the clouds around her move, so also\nthe Self seems to the in=\r\ndiscriminating to be active, when actually, the\nsenses are active.\n\nTo be a=\r\nctive, the body etc., must also be intelligent; they are said to be\ninert. =\r\nHow can they act without the intelligent Self participating in their\naction=\r\ns?\n\n20. Just as men do their duties in the light of the sun (but the sun do=\r\nes\nnot participate in them), so also the body, senses, etc., function in th=\r\ne\nlight of the Self without its participating in them.\n\nTrue, the Self alon=\r\ne is intelligence. I know myself to be born,growing,\ndecaying, happy, or un=\r\nhappy and so on. Am I right?\n\n21. No. The characteristics (birth, death, et=\r\nc.) of the body and the senses\nare superimposed on the Being- Consciousness=\r\n-Bliss as is the blue in the sky\nby those who do not discriminate.\n\n22. So =\r\nalso the characteristics of the mind, such as agency, etc., are by\nignoranc=\r\ne superimposed on the Atman, as are the movements of water on the\nmoon refl=\r\nected in it.\n\n23. Only when the intellect is manifested, likes and dislikes=\r\n, pleasure and\npain are felt. In deep sleep, the intellect remaining latent=\r\n, they are not\nfelt. Therefore, they are of the intellect and not of the At=\r\nman (the Self).\nHere is the real nature of the Atman.\n\n24. As light is the =\r\nvery sun, coldness the water, heat the fire, so also the\neternal, pure Bein=\r\ng-Consciousness-Bliss is the very Self.\n\nAt some time or other, every indiv=\r\nidual experiences, =E2=80=98I am happy=E2=80=99, and thus\nBeing-Consciousne=\r\nss-Bliss experience is plain. How can one make the\nexperience permanent and=\r\n unchanging?\n\n25. Being-Consciousness is of the Self; the =E2=80=98I=E2=80=\r\n=99 mode or modification is of\nthe intellect; these are distinctly two.Howe=\r\nver, owing to ignorance, the\nindividual mixes them together and thinks =E2=\r\n=80=98I know=E2=80=99 and acts accordingly.\n\n26. Never is there any change =\r\n(or action) in Atman nor knowledge in the\nintellect. Only the jiva is delud=\r\ned into thinking itself to be the knower,\ndoer and seer.\n\n27. Like the snak=\r\ne in the rope, mistaking the jiva for the Self, one is\nsubject to fear. If,=\r\n on the other hand, one knows oneself not as a jiva but\nas the supreme Self=\r\n, one is altogether free from fear.\n\n28. Only the Self illumines the senses=\r\n, intellect, etc., as a lamp does\nobjects such as pots. The Self is not ill=\r\numined by them as they are inert.\n\nIf the Self cannot be made known by the =\r\nintellect, there will be no knower\nto know the Self and the Self cannot be =\r\nknown.\n\n29. To see a light, no other light is needed. So also, the Self bei=\r\nng\nself-effulgent, needs no other means of knowledge. It shines of itself.\n=\r\n\nIf so, every one must be Self-realized, effortlessly, but it is not so.\n\n3=\r\n0. On the strength of the Vedic teaching, =E2=80=98Not this, not this=E2=80=\r\n=99, eliminate\nall the adjuncts (upadhis) and with the help of the mahavaky=\r\nas, realize the\nidentity of the jivatman (individual self) with the paramat=\r\nman (the supreme\nSelf).\n\n31. The whole objective world such as the body, is=\r\n born of ignorance and\ntransient like a bubble on water. Know the Self to b=\r\ne distinct from it and\nidentical with Brahman (the Supreme).\n\n32. Being dis=\r\ntinct from the gross body, birth, death, old age, debility,\netc., do not pe=\r\nrtain to me. Not being the senses, I have no connection with\nthe objects of=\r\n the senses such as sound, etc.\n\n33. The srutis declare: =E2=80=98I am not =\r\nthe vital air (prana), not the mind, (but)\npure (Being).=E2=80=99 Not being=\r\n the mind I am free from likes and dislikes, fear,\netc.\n\n34. =E2=80=98I am =\r\nfree from qualities and actionless, eternal, undifferentiated,\nuntainted, u=\r\nnchanging, formless, ever free and pure.\n\n...

To see a light, no other light is needed. =\r\nSo also, the Self being self-effulgent, needs no other means of knowledge. =\r\nIt shines of itself.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If so, every one must be Self-realized, effortl=\r\nessly, but it is not so.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;30. On the strength of the Vedic teaching=\r\n, =E2=80=98Not this, not this=E2=80=99, eliminate all the adjuncts (upadhis=\r\n) and with the help of the mahavakyas, realize the identity of the jivatman=\r\n (individual self) with the paramatman (the supreme Self).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;31. The=\r\n whole objective world such as the body, is born of ignorance and transient=\r\n like a bubble on water. Know the Self to be distinct from it and identical=\r\n with Brahman (the Supreme).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;32. Being distinct from the gross body,=\r\n birth, death, old age, debility, etc., do not pertain to me. Not being the=\r\n senses, I have no connection with the objects of the senses such as sound,=\r\n etc.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;33. The srutis declare: =\r\n=E2=80=98I am not the vital air (prana), not the mind, (but) pure (Being).=\r\n=E2=80=99 Not being the mind I am free from likes and dislikes, fear, etc.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;34. =E2=80=98I am free from qualities and actionless, eternal, undif=\r\nferentiated, untainted, unchanging, formless, ever free and pure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;...
