I have seen the diamond example, but no=\r\nt the other inputs before.\n\nUnlike the diamond example, here is another fac=\r\net I learnt. Lord Krsna has 64 qualities while Lord Narayana has 60 qualiti=\r\nes only. Brahman is the effulgence of LordKrsna and the ones who follow adv=\r\naita get into a situation of no birth, no death and merge in the brahma jyo=\r\nthi. This is under the rulership of Lord SadaShiva (the supreme to all Siva=\r\ns). The devotees of Lord Krsna (let us take it as dvaita) can have an etern=\r\nal relationship with Lord serving them (Lord is never alone, his hladini sh=\r\nakti as Radharani is always with him) either as a cow or lotus plant or kad=\r\namba tree. \n\nEven in the example you have given, the facets of diamond are =\r\nfine. But why do we need to attribute one facet&#39;s relation with the other. =\r\nSo, either the relations are just an allegory or they are real. If they are=\r\n real, then the relations have to respected as is. It also can mean, the su=\r\npreme who has expanded himself or created the rest of the facets. If it is =\r\nthe latter, there is only one supreme and the next question is, who is that=\r\n original ?\n\nAnyways, I am just thinking loud as the stories / allegories l=\r\nook good to some extent, beyond which it is tough to imagine some scenarios=\r\n. Unless it has been corrupted, Sanathana Dharma has made understanding the=\r\n Lord very difficult.\n\nLastly, I liked Sh Manish&#39;s response to one of my co=\r\nncerns on one of these kind of questions - &quot;See, don&#39;t care what anyone say=\r\ns; Just do Sadhana like crazy, ok !&quot; \n\nregards\nrAma\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thi=\r\ns is partly addressed in the diamond analogy in the very first \n&gt; message o=\r\nf this yahoogroup \n&gt; (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1)=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesson=\r\ns, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and =\r\nPitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       =\r\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID:=\r\n @homam108\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Sep 24, 2011 at 3:34 AM, Rama V wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Namaste.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I beg to disagree and will leave it at that.

I am completing the last time on =\r\nthe Chaturdasi before the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Navaratris begin. During Navaratris I plan =\r\nto perform Chandi Homam \n&gt; &gt;&gt; with 700 verses.
