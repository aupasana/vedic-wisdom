But, in case somebody is stuck, some rituals can help. Rituals a=\r\nre just rituals in the beginning and do not mean much. As one does a ritual=\r\n with some mental focus and desire, slowly the desired result occurs.\n \nIf =\r\none&#39;s ancestor who is stuck gets freedom of rebirth after rituals by one, o=\r\nne is not necessarily playing god. One is only playing a part.\n \nWe affect =\r\nthe lives of many low level organisms like bacteria, viruses etc with many =\r\nlittle things we do. It is not necessarily playing god. Due to debts betwee=\r\nn various beings, god creates situations where one being can have a major i=\r\nmpact on the life of another being. It is not playing god, but a privilege =\r\ngiven based on the play of debts.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourse=\r\nlf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.n=\r\net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jaga=\r\nnnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message =\r\n----- \n  From: Murahari Vadapalli \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Se=\r\nnt: Wednesday, June 24, 2009 8:48 PM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Pitr=\r\ni Tarpana Question\n        Namaste Narasimha, \n\n        We do not have cont=\r\nrol over our birth and death. \n\n        In that case, what does this statem=\r\nent mean?\n\n        &quot; You can free yourself from the rina by working on givi=\r\nng a rebirth to that ancestor.&quot;\n\n        I have heard from elders and learn=\r\ned members in my family and people that until tarpana or shraddha is provid=\r\ned, the spirits would be roaming around and if we perform this ritual, the =\r\nspirit would take the body to fulfil it&#39;s remaining desires.

Not so long ago, every Braahmana used to perform a brief pitri ta=\r\nrpana everyday, as a part of daily rituals. This is not without reason.\n\n  =\r\n                  *        *        *\n\n                    The thoughts of =\r\nthe minds around us do have a subtle impact on our mind. When too many depr=\r\nessed, sad or frustrated people are around you, it will have a negative eff=\r\nect on you. Similarly, when some peaceful and blissful people or elevated s=\r\nouls are around you, it will have a positive effect on you. Thus, thoughts =\r\nin the minds around you does have an impact on you.\n\n                    Th=\r\nis is particularly true with respect to the minds of people who have geneti=\r\nc/kaarmik links/debts with you. When minds of such people are in great dist=\r\nress or great excitement, it has an impact on your mind.\n\n                 =\r\n   If a deceased ancestor to whom you have a kaarmik debt has some strong d=\r\nesires and unable to progress to a higher loka or be reborn, his thoughts a=\r\nnd desires will have an impact on your mind.\n\n                    Thus, we =\r\ninvest our mental energy praying for their relief. While offering balls of =\r\nsolid food (shraaddha) on special occasions, pray that the ancestor may get=\r\n an appropriate body again to fulfil remaining desires. While leaving water=\r\n in pitri tarpana, pray that the ancestor&#39;s desires may be satisfied and th=\r\ne ancestor may be overcome the weaknesses. By praying for helping an ancest=\r\nor, you are indirectly helping yourself, by removing a powerful negative in=\r\nfluence on your mind and getting rid of some weaknesses.\n\n                 =\r\n   Unfortunately, the extremely simple ritual of pitri tarpana is out of fa=\r\nshion today. However, so many people will benefit tremendously if they do i=\r\nt atleast once every month if not daily. Vimalananda says that he will pick=\r\n pitri tarpana if there is only one ritual he can perform.\n\n               =\r\n     *        *        *\n\n                    Not long ago, every orthodox =\r\nBraahmana used to perform a fire ritual and a water ritual (tarpana) everyd=\r\nay. Rituals use external symbols to induce internal changes. These two ritu=\r\nals are really important and useful rituals.\n\n                    A small c=\r\nomparison of homam and tarpana is reproduced from vedic-wisdom yahoogroup a=\r\nrchives:\n\n                    ------------ --------- -----\n                =\r\n    One word on Homam vs Tarpana. In homam, you are calling devatas and the=\r\n medium is fire. In tarpana, you are calling pitris and the medium is water=\r\n. Both sadhanas are applicable to all people irrespective of whether watery=\r\n signs/planets are strong or fiery signs/planets in their horoscope.\n      =\r\n               \n                    In homam, devatas come in fire and burn=\r\n your blocking karmas to purify you. In tarpana, pitris come in water and f=\r\nree you from vasanas (conditioning of the mind) that were karmically inheri=\r\nted from them. If you have genes from (and rina with) an ancestor who was l=\r\nustful or angry or jealous and the consciousness of the deceased ancestor i=\r\ns still having those thoughts, you will also suffer from such thoughts due =\r\nto the connection and may even commit some bad karmas because of the weakne=\r\nsses. You can free yourself from the rina by working on giving a rebirth to=\r\n that ancestor. If the ancestor&#39;s consciousness is attached to a new body, =\r\nthe thoughts and cravings of that consciousness will not affect your consci=\r\nousness in the same way. Thus, tarpana aims to cut off a strong source of b=\r\nad karmas, while homam burns off previously committed bad karmas. Both are =\r\nvery important sadhanas for spiritual progress.\n                     \n     =\r\n               Devatas are very subtle forms of consciousness. Their self-i=\r\ndentification is to what is known as soul and represented by Sun. They work=\r\n on your individual soul and free it from the karmas it carries. Pitris are=\r\n grosser forms of consciousness with strong attachments and desires. Their =\r\nself-identification is with what is known as mind and represented by Moon. =\r\nYou may note that Sun and Moon are associated with Devas and Pitris in the =\r\nhora chart of astrology. Fire and water are the natural media for them resp=\r\nectively.\n                     \n                    Devas and pitris have d=\r\nifferent ways of working and influencing us and helping our spiritual progr=\r\ness. But both are relevant to all of us and have a role to play in our spir=\r\nitual evolution. Worshipping devas in fire and satisfying pitris in water a=\r\nre very important.\n                    ------------ --------- -----\n\n      =\r\n              Best regards,\n                    Narasimha\n                 =\r\n   ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n\n                    Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org/ homam\n                    Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n                    Spirituality: http://groups. =\r\nyahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n                    Free Jyotish lessons (MP=\r\n3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n                    Free Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n                    Sri =\r\nJagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n              =\r\n      ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- \n                     \n                    --- In JyotishGroup@ yahoogr=\r\noups. com, Ramakrishnan Krishnamurthy &lt;ramki108@...&gt; wrote:\n               =\r\n     &gt;\n                    &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n                    &gt;  \n      =\r\n              &gt; Thanks for this valuable manual.

Thus, tarp=\r\nana aims to \n                    cut off a strong source of bad karmas, whi=\r\nle homam burns off \n                    previously committed bad karmas. Bo=\r\nth are very important \n                    sadhanas for spiritual progress.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Devatas are \n                    very subtle forms of conscio=\r\nusness. Their \n                    self-identification is to what is known =\r\nas soul and \n                    represented by Sun. They work on your indi=\r\nvidual soul and \n                    free it from the karmas it carries. Pi=\r\ntris are grosser forms \n                    of consciousness with strong at=\r\ntachments and desires. Their \n                    self-identification is wi=\r\nth what is known as mind and \n                    represented by Moon. You =\r\nmay note that Sun and Moon are \n                    associated with Devas a=\r\nnd Pitris in the hora chart of \n                    astrology. Fire and wat=\r\ner are the natural media for them \n                    respectively.&lt;BR&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;BR&gt;Devas and pitris have different \n                    ways of working=\r\n and influencing us and helping our spiritual \n                    progress=\r\n. But both are relevant to all of us and have a role \n                    t=\r\no play in our spiritual evolution.

Could you \n           =\r\n         enlighten me on the difference between Pitri Tarpana and \n        =\r\n            Shraddham? I believe Shraddham is performed once a year on \n   =\r\n                 the thithi of demise of one&#39;s father (to be performed by t=\r\nhe \n                    eldest son). There are some variants such as perfor=\r\nming it \n                    during the Shraddha Paksham instead of on the =\r\nactual thithi, \n                    every year. Also, have heard of a Gaya =\r\nShraddham, which is \n                    to be performed once in a lifetime=\r\n, and which makes it \n                    unnecessary to perform yearly Shr=\r\naddham subsequently. \n                    &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Have trie=\r\nd to search for material on \n                    this but have not succeede=\r\nd so far. At least if you can \n                    provide information on s=\r\nome sources, it would be a great \n                    help.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; Thanks and regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                    Ram&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; --- On Fri, 12/6/09, Narasimha P.V.R. \n                    Rao &lt;pvr@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n                    &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Now a Vishnu sahasra naama homam manual is \n                    availabl=\r\ne.
