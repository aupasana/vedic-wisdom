The lowest level is vaikhari. This is the sound at the physical level=\r\n. When you say something by moving the physical body parts (lips etc), thei=\r\nr movement=C2=A0vibrates the air particles and those vibrations vibrate the=\r\n physical body parts in the ears of listeners and people around you can &quot;li=\r\nsten&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nAt the same time, the subtle thoughts in the mind accompanyin=\r\ng the chanting of the mantra result in movement in parts of your &quot;subtle bo=\r\ndy&quot;, which vibrate the subtle space around you and those cause some vibrati=\r\nons in the subtle bodies of people around you.\n=C2=A0\nIn this way, sound (o=\r\nr vibration) is produced at 4 levels. The subtler the level, the longer the=\r\n signal can carry without decaying.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIf one ha=\r\ns some shakti accumulated with a specific mantra, one&#39;s chanting of that ma=\r\nntra is infused with that shakti.\n=C2=A0\nThe energy infused when one chants=\r\n a mantra is carried mainly in the subtler levels of sound. The energy carr=\r\nied at the physical level (vaikhari) of sound is very small compared to the=\r\n energy carried in the subtler levels. However, the vaikhari level sound co=\r\nntains the key to the subtler levels for most people.\n=C2=A0\nI can explain =\r\nthis using an analogy. One may have a powerful concept or idea in mind that=\r\n one is thinking of. Most other people cannot read one&#39;s mind and cannot ac=\r\ncess that concept or idea. However, if one expresses the idea in words, peo=\r\nple will be able to access that idea. Most of the power is in the idea and =\r\nnot in the exact words used. However, the written/spoken words that are tan=\r\ngible to others act as a key to one&#39;s thoughts. World can now access the po=\r\nwer of one&#39;s idea!\n=C2=A0\nSimilarly, the exact letters or words of a mantra=\r\n are not really alive with energy. But, when one does sadhana with the mant=\r\nra, one&#39;s chanting of the mantra is infused with some power. Other people c=\r\nannot access that power normally. But, once one says the mantra in an audib=\r\nle form (just like expressing the idea in tangible words above), the power =\r\nin one&#39;s chanting of the mantra is accessible to those who hear it. Even th=\r\nough the power is not really in the audible sound produced, the audible sou=\r\nnd acts as a key to the inaudible sound and world can now access the power =\r\nof one&#39;s chanting (just as the written words act as a key to one&#39;s idea and=\r\n the world can now access the power of one&#39;s idea).\n=C2=A0\nWhen you chant a=\r\n mantra silently, you are hiding your shakti with the mantra from the world=\r\n. When you chant a mantra loud, you are sharing your shakti with the mantra=\r\n with the world. Some of it can be wasted and some of it can be tapped by s=\r\nomeone.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIf leaves, flowers and fruits are pluc=\r\nked from a small plant, it will not grow and it will die. Similarly, one&#39;s =\r\nshakti with a mantra will not grow if one keeps saying that mantra loud now=\r\n and then. As one keeps chanting a mantra silently, while maintaining some =\r\nyama and niyama, one will slowly accumulate shakti with it.\n=C2=A0\nIf you d=\r\no not intend to accumulate shakti with any mantra, that is fine too. That i=\r\ns NOT an impediment to self-purification and self-realization. However, cer=\r\ntain tasks in this dual world require an accumulation of enough shakti with=\r\n a mantra. If one&#39;s guru wants one to do something in future and asks one t=\r\no accumulate shakti with a specific mantra, one has to do it.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nManish&#39;s guru was a realized man. His name was Nakhate M=\r\naharaj. He was a Bhadra Kaali worshipper. He was blessed by a darshan of Bh=\r\nadra Kaali and went into nirvikalpa samadhi at the age of 21 years. He rema=\r\nined in nirvikalpa samadhi for 7 days and returned to the dual world to per=\r\nform the tasks assigned to him, as a detached actor.\n=C2=A0\nEven a realized=\r\n man like him did not utter some mantras audibly. For example, when he gave=\r\n a specific mantra to Manish, the means he employed were quite old-fashione=\r\nd. He did not say the mantra in Manish&#39;s ear. Instead, he asked Manish to s=\r\nit down with closed eyes and placed his thumbs on Manish&#39;s temples. He aske=\r\nd Manish to focus and then he also focused. Manish saw a mantra in Devanaga=\r\nri script in letters made of fire. He remembered what he saw and did sadhan=\r\na with that mantra.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThese methods are used for=\r\n a purpose and not out of selfishness. There are two main reasons:\n=C2=A0\n(=\r\n1) You want to keep the shakti you accumulated with that mantra, because th=\r\nere is a purpose for it. Giving is great, but giving indiscriminately is un=\r\nwise. When one can do finite tasks, one has to optimize what one does.\n(2) =\r\nNothing that comes too easy lasts. If one gets a million bucks easily, one =\r\ncan waste it. Instead of giving million dollars to someone, it will be bett=\r\ner if you teach one how to work hard and make money.\n=C2=A0\nSharing various=\r\n thoughts and spiritual truths and inspiring people to do sadhana=C2=A0is o=\r\nne thing and sharing one&#39;s accumulated shakti with a mantra with people ano=\r\nther.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nAs I mentioned Nakhate Maharaj, I want=\r\n to mention a small story about him.\n=C2=A0\nWhen Nakhate Maharaj left this =\r\nworld, his sishyas had an interesting experience. Manish was in UK meditati=\r\nng at that time. He suddenly felt that his guru was in front of him. He ope=\r\nned his eyes and saw that Nakhate Maharaj was standing in front of him phys=\r\nically. He held his palm up in the blessing pose. Then he waved his hand as=\r\n if saying good bye. Then he disappeared. When Manish called India later, h=\r\ne found out that Nakhate Maharaj left his body at the same time in India. H=\r\ne also found out that his other sishyas too had the same experience in diff=\r\nerent parts of the world around the same time.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasim=\r\nha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a =\r\nShort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpana=\r\ns Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicas=\r\ntro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n\n----- =\r\nOriginal Message ----- \nFrom: Jyotisa Shisya \nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom \nSent: Sunday, June 07, 2009 10:45 AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: H=\r\nelp me Regarding SAVITRU GAAYATHRI MANTHRAM\n\n|om|\nDear Narasimha, namaste &=\r\n pranaams\n=C2=A0\nPlease forgive me if I am seen to be impertinent in my que=\r\nstion based on the lines in bold below.\n=C2=A0\nWhy must the Guru upadesa be=\r\n kept secret and not shared with anyone who might benefit?

However, if =\r\none expresses the idea in words, people will be able to access that idea. M=\r\nost of the power is in the idea and not in the exact words used. However, t=\r\nhe written/spoken words that are tangible to others act as a key to one&#39;s t=\r\nhoughts. World can now access the power of one&#39;s idea!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;Similarly, the exact letters or words of a mantra are not really alive=\r\n with energy. But, when one does sadhana with the mantra, one&#39;s chanting of=\r\n the mantra is infused with some power. Other people cannot access that pow=\r\ner normally. But, once one says the mantra in an audible form (just like ex=\r\npressing the idea in tangible words above), the power in one&#39;s chanting of =\r\nthe mantra is accessible to those who hear it. Even though the power is not=\r\n really in the audible sound produced, the audible sound acts as a key to t=\r\nhe inaudible sound and world can now access the power of one&#39;s chanting (ju=\r\nst as the written words act as a key to one&#39;s idea and the world can now ac=\r\ncess the power of one&#39;s idea).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D=\r\n2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;When you chant a man=\r\ntra silently, you are hiding your shakti with the mantra from the world.

I can record other mantras in my voice and share with all, &lt;B&gt;but in=\r\nstructed to not give Savitur Gayatri mantra in my voice to anyone. It is my=\r\n spiritual food. Most of my spiritual experiences came with this mantra and=\r\n I need this mantra for more things in future. So I keep it to myself and d=\r\no not share it with all.&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;But many people in you=\r\nr city should be able to teach you this mantra with correct pronunciation. =\r\nBy the way, I think you live in Chennai. If so, please try to meet Swami Sa=\r\nthasivom at Kalikambal temple on Thambuchetty Street near Central station. =\r\nHe belongs to a rare class of priests who are fast becoming extinct in this=\r\n commercial age.

Surrender to your chosen deity, see =\r\nthat deity in all people and serve people around you. See god in all people=\r\n. If possible, think of starting a small movement in the slums of Chennai (=\r\nor wherever you live). Go, serve people there, help them to the best of you=\r\nr ability and teach them about god. After helping them materially first, th=\r\nen teach them to chant god&#39;s name when they have a few minutes of time. In =\r\nmy opinion, this is the right path for you.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D=\r\nArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Actions=\r\n performed with ego, pride and attachment bind one. Actions without ego, pr=\r\nide and attachment liberate one. Please perform big acts of social service =\r\nand yet without any pride or attachment. Do not be upset with a few failure=\r\ns in the beginning (upset comes with attachment. A detached person is not u=\r\npset if his sincere actions do not give the intended result) and keep tryin=\r\ng calmly. Sincere and detached action never fails in the long run.
