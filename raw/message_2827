Yes. One can do=\r\n homam as many times as one wants. It will give faster \n&gt;   results if one =\r\nmaintains the same devotion and focus.\n&gt; \n&gt;   In general, if one has free t=\r\nime, it is better spent in activities that make \n&gt;   one focus the mind on =\r\ngod (to the extent one is capable of) rather than in \n&gt;   activities that m=\r\nake one focus the mind on impermanent things.\n&gt; \n&gt;   2. Do not worry about =\r\ncontinuity. Forget a break of 7 days. Even if one does \n&gt;   a sadhana in on=\r\ne life, leaves earth and is reborn after 700 years and \n&gt;   continues the s=\r\nadhana, there WILL be continuity. One may or may not perceive \n&gt;   the cont=\r\ninuity, but it will be there.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Do not worry about continuity and keep=\r\n doing whenever you can. No effort is \n&gt;   wasted.\n&gt; \n&gt;   3. It is fine to =\r\ntake the yantra with you and pray. But you should follow \n&gt;   the opinion o=\r\nf the person who energized it for you, instead of my opinion.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Yes, i=\r\nt can be used in homam. You can put it next to homa kundam and invoke \n&gt;   =\r\nthe deity in it. If one is ok with a yantra getting disfigured, one can eve=\r\nn \n&gt;   put in *inside* the homa kundam on the base of the homa kundam and l=\r\neave it \n&gt;   there.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Best regards,\n&gt;   Narasimha\n&gt;   ------------ ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;   Do a Short Homam Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt;   Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;   Spirituality: http://groups. =\r\nyahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;   Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedic=\r\nastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;   Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAst rologer.org\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/Jy=\r\notishWri tings\n&gt;   Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan =\r\nnath.org\n&gt;   ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n - \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: &quot;metllapalli&quot; &lt;metllapal=\r\nli@ yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt;   To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, =\r\nOctober 06, 2009 3:39 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [vedic-wisdom] homam questions... .\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;   &gt; Respected Sir,\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; I have a few more questions if you can p=\r\nlease help me with this.\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; 1. Can homam be done two times a day? =\r\nWill that give faster results?\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; 2. Presently I am doing homam on=\r\n a daily basis. Due to woman issues every \n&gt;   &gt; month I get a break of 7 d=\r\nays after which when I start the homam I feel \n&gt;   &gt; the continuity is lost=\r\n. I feel I have to start fresh. I have seen you \n&gt;   &gt; mention in the forum=\r\ns that homam should be done on a weekly or daily \n&gt;   &gt; basis. Do you think=\r\n I will still get the benefit with breaks in between ? \n&gt;   &gt; Is there anyw=\r\nay I can keep the continuity going?\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; 3. I have an energised maha=\r\nlakshmi yantra which I pray on a regular basis. \n&gt;   &gt; How should I care fo=\r\nr it when I go on a vacation? Shall I carry it with me \n&gt;   &gt; whereever I g=\r\no so that its not neglected? Also can I use it in homam?\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Thanks=\r\n,\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt;   &gt;\n&gt;   &gt; Sudha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
