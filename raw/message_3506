It is there that I read about =\r\nhis meditating at the Manikarnika for 3 continuous days. He had left home a=\r\nt the age of about 11/12 ( from bihar - where he was born) to become a wond=\r\nering monk and landed up in Kasi finally. When he came to Kasi he went to t=\r\nhe Dasasmedha Ghat where he saw a lady - very well dress, decked in jewelle=\r\nry - standing. The kind lady told him that she will take him to visit Vishw=\r\nanath, but before that asked him to take a bath in the water. As he came ou=\r\nt of the Ganges water he saw the lady had bought some milk, ghee, flowers a=\r\nnd asked the young boy to accompany him as she lead him to the Kasi Vishwan=\r\nath temple. Once they reached the Shiva Linga, the lady instructed him how =\r\nto do Abhisekha of the Linga with the stuff she had bought. After coming ou=\r\nt of the temple, the lady kept walking along the lanes - VIshwanath Gali - =\r\nwith the 11 year old boy following her.\n Suddenly infront of a huge gate, t=\r\nhey stopped and the lady went inside. Baba Bhagwan Ram thought it must be t=\r\nhe house of some rich person, and preferred to stand outside waiting. Plus =\r\nthat was his first day in Kasi, and he had neither any money for anything e=\r\nlse with him. After waiting there for a few hours, when the lady did not co=\r\nme out, he decided to enter through the gates. Once inside he realized that=\r\n it was not the house of a rich man but the famous Annapoorna temple. And t=\r\nhere was no sign of that lady anywhere! Confused, he came out of the Vishwa=\r\nnath Gali into the main road, when he saw that lady standing there again. S=\r\nhe called him and asked him, what does he want. Bhagwan Ram said he wanted =\r\nto realize God. The lady instructed him to go to the Kinnarama Ashram, sayi=\r\nng there are paramhamsas who live there, you will find guidance there. Devo=\r\ntees of Baba Bhagwan Ram believe that lady was none other than Ma Annapurna=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\nLater, he was instructed in many Aghor Sadhanas and spend years pr=\r\nactising them. When he had been meditating at the Manikarnika for three day=\r\ns - he used to live on the samshan like an Aghori - around the age of 18/19=\r\n (I don&#39;t recollect exactly), he suddenly saw/felt/realized everything as m=\r\nillions of=C2=A0beautiful petals of concentric circle around a centre. He c=\r\nhose a few of the petals and came back to his normal senses again. After th=\r\nat, he said, any slight desire that would arise in the mind would immediate=\r\nly manifest. \n=C2=A0\nWith age, Baba Bhagawan Ram toured all along India and=\r\n even went abroad telling people about God realization and sadhana. He was =\r\nthe person who opened up the Kinnaram Ashram to ordinary people, before him=\r\n the ashram never encouraged ordinary visitor. Even today, if=C2=A0you go t=\r\nhere you will hardly find not more than 5/6 people at any given time.=C2=A0=\r\nBut his idea was to let people come in and meditate inside the ashram premi=\r\nses. He made all sadhakas of the ashram promise to become vegetarians and n=\r\not use alcohol. \n=C2=A0\nHe died in 1990s (dont remember exact year). Some p=\r\neople consider him to be a reincarnation of Baba Kinnaram.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=\r\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n\nRama Naama Satya Hai..\n\n--- On Tue, 19/1/10, Kishore=\r\n Chitrapu &lt;chitrapu@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: Kishore Chitrapu &lt;chitrapu@gm=\r\nail.com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Rama Naam Satya Hai - 3\nTo: vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com\nCc: pvr@..., rporuri@...\nDate: Tuesday, 19=\r\n January, 2010, 1:00 AM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\nNamaste,\n\nRajarshi, your whole experie=\r\nnce seems like an important move in the chess game that is being played by =\r\nNature.

I was writing in a flow and never checked what I wrote. Kindly p=\r\nardon such errors and read through them. As they say, &quot;Bhavnayoko samjho!&quot;.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nDuring the day time, we roamed around shooting at dif=\r\nferent places. In this 3 days we never visited any of the temples in Kasi. =\r\nI asked him, &quot;What about the temples? Won&#39;t we visit them?&quot;. Manish retorte=\r\nd immediately, &quot;=C2=A0Aren&#39;t we=C2=A0going to the most powerful temple in K=\r\nasi every night?&quot;! I silently agreed. This is something about Manish I have=\r\n observed. He rarely enters temples or standard places of worship, but sudd=\r\nenly he might see a small roadside temple and stand and stare for sometimes=\r\n, even do a pranam and then remark, &quot;There is something here.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nDurin=\r\ng evening we went to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Baba was a Aghori =\r\nwho lived in Kasi=C2=A0during the 16th century. The place is called Aghor-s=\r\nthal. Before entering Manish bought some bel leaves. As we walked inside th=\r\ne Ashram, Manish became silent, then said there are strong energies in here=\r\n. Inside we meditated for sometime, Manish did=C2=A0 pranam=C2=A0at the sam=\r\nadhi of Baba Bhagwan Ram who was the 11th head of the Ashram. Baba Bhagwan =\r\nRam had entered Nirvikalpa Samadhi while meditating for 3 continuous days a=\r\nt the Manikarnika Samshan.=C2=A0 Manish, on being=C2=A0questioned, said tha=\r\nt many sadhanas have been done here in this place for long by people with n=\r\no mundane desires. Therefore, the energies are strong here. While looking a=\r\nround the Ashram we found some quotations which were written in small woode=\r\nn boards. Manish called Arunisha and me and pointed to one quotation. Trans=\r\nlated to English, it read, &quot;If you have to give your head off to get a sadg=\r\nuru, you\n have=C2=A0got it cheap&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nBy 8 PM we sat for dinner. We use=\r\nd to have early dinners, so that we had sufficient time before going to the=\r\n samshan. Ideally you should have an empty stomach while performing any sad=\r\nhana to get the best effects. The amount of fire in the body is fixed. Ther=\r\ne is one that digests food - Jathara Agni. One that digests ideas/concepts/=\r\n experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential fire) which exists in the subtle bod=\r\ny. It is the second which must increase in order for one to &quot;digest&quot; variou=\r\ns experiences/ ideas/etc. It can only increase when the Jathara Agni is les=\r\ns, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. When we are extremely focused on so=\r\nmething and working intently on the same, we forget food, we do not feel hu=\r\nngry. This is due to the increase in Bhuta Agni and decrease in Jathara Agn=\r\ni.\n=C2=A0\nAs we sat eating our food and talking on different topics, we dis=\r\ncussed history.The conversation mentioned here is a thread picked up from a=\r\nn earlier conversation that we (Manish, Arunisha and=C2=A0me) had before co=\r\nming to Kasi. \n=C2=A0\nManish said, &quot;It is the same set of=C2=A0souls who co=\r\nme back=C2=A0again and again in different bodies and personalities at diffe=\r\nrent times, who=C2=A0are responsible for this land. There was Chadragupta a=\r\nnd Chanakya, there was Prithviraj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ramakri=\r\nshna etc.&quot; He continued, &quot;They can come as kings, yogis, or any other form =\r\nwhich is necessary for them to accomplish their dharma. And their dharma is=\r\n connected to this land=C2=A0which we call India=C2=A0today.This land is co=\r\nnnected to the Rishis. This is Rishi bhoomi. And Rishis sent people when ne=\r\neded.=C2=A0Prithviraj made one mistake, of pardoning Ghori. Imagine what ha=\r\nppened to that woman who made Prithiviraj disobey his Guru?&quot;.I silently con=\r\ntemplated her fate.=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n&quot;One very senior Rishi has decided to=C2=\r\n=A0change this land back to a Rishi bhoomi. And so shall it happen.=C2=A0Ve=\r\nd=C2=A0Dharma will be re established here along the length and breadth. Not=\r\nhing, however powerful or mightly, be it an individual or=C2=A0group,=C2=A0=\r\ncan stand against the will of a Rishi.&quot;=C2=A0 Arunisha asked a pertinent qu=\r\nestion here. &quot;What were the Rishis doing for=C2=A0one thousand years?&quot;. Man=\r\nish laughed and said, &quot; A Rishi can very well spend a thousand years simply=\r\n in samadhi, meditating. Then suddenly=C2=A0one day=C2=A0wake up from medit=\r\nation=C2=A0and see that Rishi bhoomi is gone=C2=A0and all sorts of non-spir=\r\nitual things going on here. So He decides, it is time to get back and re cr=\r\neate the Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no clue about=C2=A0what a Rishi can do=\r\n. One Rishi is enough to change a universe, changing a country is child&#39;s p=\r\nlay for Him.&quot; Wow. I let all these sink inside me slowly. Therefore it is s=\r\no important to keep doing sadhana, in some manner or the other.\n=C2=A0\nAs n=\r\night approached midnight, Manish and I left for the Manikarnika again. This=\r\n was going be our last night of Chandi homa at Manikarnika, for now. We wal=\r\nked long the=C2=A0deserted ghats, sliently. I asked him if it is ok doing a=\r\n=C2=A0homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said=C2=A0yes why not, but witho=\r\nut Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the divine feminie is the mo=\r\nst practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the state of highest consciousne=\r\nss, and to reach that stage one must develop his body and mind such that it=\r\n can hold shakti=C2=A0for which=C2=A0worshipping the divine Mother is the b=\r\nest way.=C2=A0That is why Vimalananda says, &quot;Let the Mother show you the fa=\r\nce of the Father&quot;. The topic drifted to Vimalananda. Manish said, &quot;Kala Bha=\r\nirava is very strong in Manikarnika, where as Mahakala exists powerfully in=\r\n the cremation grouds at Ujjain. But Vimalananda did Mahakala sadhana here =\r\nin Manikarnika.&quot; Then staring at the pitch black ganges, Manish chuckled li=\r\nghtly and\n added, &quot;That man was something.&quot; This was again an old conversat=\r\nion we had started=C2=A0before which Mainsh continued, &quot;All these babas of =\r\ntoday would wet their pants if Vimalananda were to stand infornt of them. T=\r\nhose three books have the power of a deity flowing through them. Without be=\r\ning physically present, Vimalananda has created a army of sadhakas!&quot;. I int=\r\nerjected, &quot;The books=C2=A0are like a Bible=C2=A0for sadhakas,=C2=A0arn&#39;t th=\r\ney?&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot; said Manish. Later on I asked him if it was possible for someon=\r\ne to meet Vimalanada, to which Manish replied that yes it was, if one does =\r\nserious sadhana. However, the important question is whether one will be abl=\r\ne to recognize him. I fell silent hearing this. Interestingly, in the 2nd b=\r\nook of the Aghora series, Vimalanda does mention that a time will come when=\r\n his &quot;children&quot; would spread homas. Strange, or maybe not so. Who knows how=\r\n deep things run. \n=C2=A0\nWe reached the samshan by half past twelve. This =\r\ntime we sat at the same place where we had sat on the first day of homa. Th=\r\ne fire was low. Most of the body had been burnt already. Manish started the=\r\n homa. As usual, all the dogs came and sat peacefully around the fire. Now =\r\nthis did not surprise me any more. In the middle of the homa Manish would s=\r\nlowly lift his=C2=A0palm upwards=C2=A0and with the next ahuti=C2=A0immediat=\r\nely the fire would leap higher. He did this quite a few times, when=C2=A0th=\r\ne flames were getting weaker. I countinued with the Chandi path and passing=\r\n on the samagri to him as and when he required anything. One dom who was wo=\r\nrking on a pyre nearby, came towards us and exclaimed,&quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. Manish=\r\n too responded back, &quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. This homa was faster. He did not use an=\r\ny &quot;samputs&quot;, but a direct, straight Chandi homa. Again in the middle I got =\r\nup and stroked the pyre a bit, pushing around some of the coconut pieces to=\r\n make them burn properly. I was\n enjoying it. A few people came and sat nea=\r\nr us, listening to the path. In Kasi there is a rule that whatever comes in=\r\n the Samshan is the property of the Dom Raja (the head of doms). No one has=\r\n any further claim on it. In old times, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. =\r\nHe was an Aghori and a contemporary of Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could r=\r\naise the dead back to life. Maybe it is because of this tradition that Mani=\r\nkarnika is such an apt place for these sadhanas. I was at one point mentall=\r\ny wondering why are there so many people in the samshan. The Manish said, i=\r\nf a Nath came here in his garb, everyone will run away from the samshan sca=\r\nred. But there is a reason why there are people here even so late in the ni=\r\nght.\n=C2=A0\nOnce the final purnahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Thou=\r\ngh this homa got over faster than previous days, the meditation that happen=\r\ned, for me, was superb. At one point I felt as if my mind would just burst =\r\nforth and expand across the length and breadth of the Ganges. My focus was =\r\ngood, but I had to open my eyes after every 20 minutes or so. Manish contin=\r\nued meditating for nearly an hour. Not the slightest movement from him. Not=\r\nhing. Still like a stone. Then a cow came and slightly nudged Manish on his=\r\n feet. That made him open his eyes. Manish remarked, &quot; I could have just le=\r\nft my body and gone off. It did not matter that I had a flight to catch the=\r\n next day, or anything else. I was on the verge of death. Just at that mome=\r\nnt the cow and brought me back.&quot; Smiling he added, &quot;What a sight it would h=\r\nave been for the people to see, how the body can be left at will&quot;.=C2=A0 I =\r\ndid not know what to say. \n=C2=A0\nWe stood there watching another pyre in f=\r\nront. The body was half burnt. The torso had become black with deep=C2=A0re=\r\nd patches all over. The dom came forward, and with the bamboo stick inserte=\r\nd it (the bamboo stick)=C2=A0from the side of the corpse, lifting up the bu=\r\nrning torso into the air and placing it again, strategically, in the middle=\r\n of the pyre. The smooth=C2=A0motion of lifting up the half burnt torso, st=\r\nicking out from one end of the bamboo stick,=C2=A0into the thin, dark, nigh=\r\nt-air reminded me of how we use a fork to lift pieces of food - meat=C2=A0o=\r\nr vegetables, both dead -=C2=A0from our plates to our mouths. Manish asked =\r\nme smiling, &quot;Maza aya?&quot;. I smiled back in acknowledgement. Then he commente=\r\nd=C2=A0that I should write about this experience in the coming days. Let pe=\r\nople know.\n=C2=A0\nBy this time I remembered that when I was sitting and doi=\r\nng the Chandi path, one dog=C2=A0had run off with one of my chappals. I inf=\r\normed Manish. He exclaimed, &quot; Kya baat hai! Leave the other chappal here as=\r\n well.&quot; Manish said we had a rna with this samshan. We had been here before=\r\n, in some life.\n=C2=A0\nAs we were returning, Manish said one of the point (=\r\nthe three peaks)=C2=A0of Shiva&#39;s trishul passes through the Manikarkina. Th=\r\nerefore, it is a &quot;safe&quot; samshan. Anyone who tries anything negative here wi=\r\nll face troubles. The trishul of Shiva guards this place. No spirit will ca=\r\nuse any unnecessary disturbance inside the samshan. That is also why there =\r\nare people here even at 2 am in the morning. There is safety in numbers. As=\r\n long as ones intentions are genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wonderful p=\r\nlace to do sadhana.\n=C2=A0\nWhile walking along the ghats=C2=A0which were=C2=\r\n=A0totally deserted, Manish instructed me not to stop. The knot in my red l=\r\nungi was becoming loose, I caught hold of it=C2=A0with one=C2=A0hand and ke=\r\npt moving fast, trying to keep pace with Manish. Later Manish asked me if I=\r\n had got some smell. I thought and recollected that yes, I did get a faint =\r\nsmell of heena. Twice. Manish told me it was a &quot;Mokul&quot;. A muslim spirit of =\r\nsimilar level as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once the ritual is over, and you a=\r\nre out of the samshan, do not wait along the banks, he instructed. Do not m=\r\nove too close to the water=C2=A0late in the nightt. There are things in the=\r\n water. Generally they may not do anything, but why take a chance. The prot=\r\nection of Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya=\r\n Baba (I may have mis-spelt the name) used to live in the middle of this Ga=\r\nnges 24/7. This is a city of saints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas would=\r\n roam around naked. It is their city.\n=C2=A0\nNext morning, as we sat recoll=\r\necting the previous night&#39;s homa, Manish talked about Vedas.=C2=A0Few sadha=\r\nks, if ever, are equally comfortable with both paths of=C2=A0Aghora and Ved=\r\nas. For a Veda mantra to show its effects, one must get the intonation perf=\r\nect. This age most people cannot do that. I=C2=A0enquired that I had heard =\r\nfrom someone that a certain procedure needs to be done before one starts an=\r\ny sadhana in the samshan. Manish=C2=A0laughed and replied,=C2=A0&quot;Karna to s=\r\nab kuch chahiye, par mujhe to kuch nehi aata!&quot;.=C2=A0I was dumbstruck.=C2=\r\n=A0\n=C2=A0\nWhile talking about Ramayana with Arunisha, his eyes suddenly be=\r\ncome half closed. He voice became slow and heavy,=C2=A0&quot;The color of Rama&#39;s=\r\n body is deep blue with a golden tinge all=C2=A0around him. Like a sun blaz=\r\ning. That=C2=A0was the kavacha given to Rama by Vishwamitra, the real Gayat=\r\nri with two special samputs. It was impenetrable. And when he shot his arro=\r\nws, the motion of his hands=C2=A0is so fast that a normal human eye will no=\r\nt able to observe. In 12 hours he had destroyed a forest of Ashuras.=C2=A0R=\r\navana had a Chandrahaas khadga. It was a=C2=A0mantra shakti he had acquired=\r\n through sadhana. The Khadga had become part of his right hand, which would=\r\n fly off to kill mercilessly at the slightest=C2=A0command from his mind. S=\r\nuch was the calibre of the enemy. \n=C2=A0\nAnd Rama removed even=C2=A0his Ga=\r\nyatri Kavacha, and fought like a normal human being when he defeated Ravana=\r\n which=C2=A0means; he even removed the last vestige of his ego of being a G=\r\nod, and fought like a human.

You, I, all the=\r\nse people are pieces in another kind of chess game. \n=C2=A0\nGreat analogy. =\r\nManish had given this analogy to us after he=C2=A0completed a beautiful=C2=\r\n=A0Ganapati homa last August. There is=C2=A0one divine chess player, and it=\r\n is totally His game. \n=C2=A0\nBefore I continue with the narration, I would=\r\n like to mention a few points which I found I had not clearly mentioned in =\r\nmy last mail:\n=C2=A0\n\nAt the end of the third day of Chandi homa at Manikar=\r\nnika samshan, we were standing and watching the pyres burn, when Manish sud=\r\ndenly said, in the coming days you will write about this experience in a pu=\r\nblic forum. Therefore my mails.\n=C2=A0\n\nCaveat: A homa on a funeral pyre is=\r\n an extreme Aghor=C2=A0sadhana, and it is not entirely risk free. Infact, i=\r\nn many paramparas it is said=C2=A0only someone who has a direct agya from S=\r\namshan Kali or Mahakala can try this procedure, or someone who has agya fro=\r\nm a powerful Guru. It was Manish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis)=C2=\r\n=A0I was only doing the Chandi Path. Therefore, by reading this accounts on=\r\ne should not, on his own, try out this sadhana. \n=C2=A0\n\nMany people have a=\r\n negative=C2=A0bias towards Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due t=\r\no lack of knowledge or understanding of the philosophy and efficacy of thes=\r\ne sadhanas. Moreover, in recent time some TV channels too have made films e=\r\ntc of Aghoris, potraying them as perverted individuals. This is grossly inc=\r\norrect. They have no clue what they are talking about, and their accounts s=\r\ntart with many preconcieved biases. Aghora is one of the many path to the r=\r\neach the same goals - Self-realization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a=\r\n path. Some like it, some don&#39;t. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen pat=\r\nh but at the same time have a healthy respect for other paths too. Many gre=\r\nat saints and spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is con=\r\nsidered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga =\r\nSwami was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master Aghori. My mails are inten=\r\nded to give a first hand objective=C2=A0account of how a\n powerful sadhana =\r\nin the samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just the cronicler.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n\nThere are many people in this age who have a desire for these sadhanas, wh=\r\no feel an attraction for this kind of a path, but have no clue how to go ab=\r\nout it. These accounts are ment to tell such=C2=A0people that these sadhana=\r\ns can and do happen even today, it is not a figment of imagination. The Man=\r\nikarnika is still as powerful as it was thousands of years ago. But to go a=\r\nbout it and=C2=A0actually be able to do this sadhana, just like everything =\r\nelse in life, there is no fixed procedures or rules. Keep doing sadhana in =\r\nwhatever condition you are in right now=C2=A0and let Nature decide. Like Sa=\r\ni Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and patience. If the desire is gen=\r\nuine and deep, and one is ready to wait, Nature will one day make arrangeme=\r\nnts. This is the eternal promise to every individual=C2=A0because for Her, =\r\nNOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so=C2=A0kind.=C2=A0 In the intruduction t=\r\no &quot;Aghora - At the left hand of God&quot;, Vimalanada says :\n\n\n&quot;Publish this boo=\r\nk after I am gone. Let people know the truth. Let them know what is what. O=\r\nut of the thousands who may read it at least a few will be sincere. They wi=\r\nll try to learn more, and then Nature Herself will make arrangements for th=\r\nem to learn just as She did for me, and they will be taught according to th=\r\neir capabilities. The progression will go on; there is nothing to fear&quot;.\nTh=\r\nerefore have faith, do sadhana.=C2=A0 \n\n=C2=A0\nBack to the narration. The s=\r\necond day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Manish said it is a powerful =\r\nnight for chita homa. Various shaktis are available on this night which can=\r\n destroy Ashuras.=C2=A0Past midnight we were walking towards Manikarnika al=\r\nong the ghats. Not a single person was to be seen anywhere on any of the mu=\r\nltitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found a pack of dogs, fighti=\r\nng among each other, blocking our path. We stopped, wondering if there was =\r\nany alternate route to the samshan. I started mentally chanting a mantra I =\r\nknew and praying to the deity to make our journey smooth. Coincidentally, j=\r\nust at that moment we saw a man coming from the other side who chased the d=\r\nogs away.=C2=A0Without looking at me=C2=A0Manish said, &quot;Sometimes a simple =\r\nprayer can work wonders but never become to big for your breeches&quot;.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\nAs we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this is a wonderful place.=C2=A0I =\r\ndid not think too much about it then since my mind was already pre occupied=\r\n with the thoughts of what is to come. The next day morning when we again c=\r\name to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting, I suddenly felt a pressure on my =\r\nhead, and then everything became calm. Manish smiled at me and said this is=\r\n where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya and the energies are still here. I w=\r\nas little skeptical mentally, since I knew that the samadhi of Trilanga Swa=\r\nmi was at a different ghat, however I did not say anything.=C2=A0Later on r=\r\neturning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who was from Beneras and that person =\r\nconfirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and do=\r\n his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed idiot.\n=C2=A0\nBack to midnight. =\r\nWe reached Manikarnika and again it was filled with people. But this time w=\r\ne did not wait. We went right inside, and Manish kept looking for a suitabl=\r\ne chita. As we came in, again people started staring at us, but they respec=\r\ntfully made way for us to pass through to the middle of the samshan. We sto=\r\nod exactly at the middle, with Manish observing the different chitas. There=\r\n were about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in thousands of years there ha=\r\ns not been a single minute when there has not been a body burning in here. =\r\nTherefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my=\r\n right which Manish was observing, when suddenly I found a mega size bull c=\r\nome and stand right next to the fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull=\r\n looked dangerous. Before I could voice my concern, Manish said let us go t=\r\no the other side of the samshan. It not only the bull,=C2=A0 but there is s=\r\nomething else as well. I did not ask him what. So we\n went to another side.=\r\n The dom there came forward and said to Manish, &quot;Baba,aap log=C2=A0kaun se =\r\nchita me baithna chahate ho?&quot;. Manish indicated one at the end, the dome th=\r\nen went ahead and asked the people standing around the chita to make space =\r\nfor us to sit. He said the heat from the fire is too stong, but Manish said=\r\n it&#39;s ok, we&#39;ll sit here itself. There were many curious onlookers, but all=\r\n made space for us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instructing oth=\r\ners not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something very uniq=\r\nue about Manikarnika. IN any other city, people would have objected, but no=\r\nt here. Manish later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadhanas =\r\nhave been done in here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes have ei=\r\nther themsleves seen these things or heard from their families and thus the=\r\ny do not disturb. \n=C2=A0\nThe homa, as usual was awesome. The pyre was larg=\r\ner than the one previous night. The heat was very strong. My focus was stro=\r\nnger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. Within ten minutes a=\r\ngain a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This was strange because=\r\n=C2=A0there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose this spe=\r\ncific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler sense perc=\r\neption than average humans like me. This homa was extended longer. Every no=\r\nw and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direction intently for a=\r\n few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw nothing. But, every=\r\ntime Manish looked at a specific direction or made some gestures, the dogs =\r\ntoo would start barking at that direction. At one point I almost felt a bit=\r\n jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which I=C2=A0 - being suc=\r\nh an=C2=A0ordinary person -=C2=A0obviously had no clue about. In the middle=\r\n of the Chandi path=C2=A0I could hear\n chants of &quot;Ram Nam Satya Hai&quot; and re=\r\nlatives wailing as new bodies were being brought in. \n=C2=A0\nSuddenly to my=\r\n right there was a sound and quite abit of smoke, I saw a transformer burst=\r\ning. The dogs immediately started barking at that. Later Manish said the Go=\r\nddess was moving around, entering the fire and leaving the fire. The bursti=\r\nng of the transformer had a link to this. As the Path was going on - the Ch=\r\nandi was in my right hand - I saw a human shadow pass over=C2=A0the pages o=\r\nf the=C2=A0book. I thought it was some relative who was standing behind me.=\r\n=C2=A0I looked back and was a shocked to find there was no one behind me. A=\r\nnd the shadow passed over my book once again. This time I did not look back=\r\n. Just kept chanting with more vigor and saying to myself &quot;all iz well&quot;-:).=\r\n=C2=A0 Manish later said, as one does sadhana the deity often comes to obse=\r\nrve and make his/her presence felt, even if slightly.=C2=A0It is not an ima=\r\ngination but reality and this can=C2=A0happen not just in a samshan but in =\r\nany sadhana anywhere. The idea is to keep doing sadhana.\n=C2=A0\nWhile offer=\r\ning coconuts into the fire, one coconut rolled off from the pyre. So I took=\r\n a long bamboo stick which the domes use to stroke the fire and pushed the =\r\ncoconut piece inside.I wondered if I=C2=A0had been a dom in any of my past =\r\nlives, because I strangely felt natural stroking the pyre=C2=A0the way the =\r\ndomes do. I even wondered if=C2=A0there was any company which would may me =\r\nfor this kind of a job, I would happily take it. What better way to do sadh=\r\nana than become a dom at Manikarkina!=C2=A0 Interestingly, I then remembere=\r\nd that Manish had bought one extra coconut while buying the samagri to toni=\r\nght&#39;s homas. Now I understood why.\n=C2=A0\nIn the middle of the homa, sudden=\r\nly Manish called one of the relatives who was standing nearby and told him=\r\n=C2=A0that the person whos body was in the pyre has just left and that=C2=\r\n=A0they (relatives) do not have to wait any more. It was already late in th=\r\ne night. The person did not know what to say. Suddenly Manish explained to =\r\nhim, do not worry, there is nothing evil or bad being done here. We are onl=\r\ny praying to Ma Durga. I guess the person was mentally wondering about what=\r\n is going on. Then another of the relatives came forward and said, &quot;Baba, h=\r\num log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge&quot;. So Manish said ok and asked them to sit d=\r\nown and continued with the homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish =\r\nasked me to observe the skin on the corpse=C2=A0 I saw the skin on the face=\r\n had caught fire and was burning. It was a sight to see!\n=C2=A0\nThere is a =\r\ntradition of pouring Ganges water=C2=A0at the end to finsh the fire. But I =\r\ncould hear the domes telling the relatives not to pour water on the pyre or=\r\n do anything there without permissin from Manish. Finally at the end they c=\r\name to Manish and=C2=A0asked if they could pour some Ganges water. Manish s=\r\naid ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will happen to the fire, it won&#39;=\r\nt die. They poured a large mud kalash full of water but nothing happened to=\r\n the fire. It kept burning. After some times, after some more ahutis, Manis=\r\nh called the people and said, &quot; Devi=C2=A0samne khadi hai. App log pranam k=\r\nijiye&quot;. At least 10/15 people came forward and reventially bowed to the fir=\r\ne. Then they wanted to touch=C2=A0Manish&#39;s feet, but Manish would not let t=\r\nhem do so. They asked for his blessings. He distributed some flower petals =\r\nwe had and told them to go home, since it was very late in the night. Sudde=\r\nnly the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had addressed earlier) came\n =\r\nrunning with tears in his eyes asking for forgiveness for having doubted. M=\r\nanish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he has done no wrong, everyt=\r\nhing is all right.=C2=A0 Later Manish said, if it was some other time of th=\r\ne day he would have brought the man along for a cup of tea. Another person =\r\nsuddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a certain saint (a famous s=\r\naint)=C2=A0who used to live in Kasi. Manish without responding to his query=\r\n asked him where was he from, the person replied interior=C2=A0Bihar. Manis=\r\nh advised him to go back home as it was late in the night. The faith of the=\r\n ordinary people of this land is what makes India so unique, that is why ou=\r\nr land and culture is still so alive. We city bred &#39;educated&#39;=C2=A0people a=\r\nre too rational to understand these things. God loves the simple and uncalc=\r\nulating. By this time I too stood up to do pranam to the fire. Immediately =\r\nI felt as if my body existed only from my head to my heart, there was nothi=\r\nng\n below, no legs, no stomach ,=C2=A0as if=C2=A0I was simply floating on t=\r\nhin=C2=A0air! I told Manish what happened, he just gave a=C2=A0curt one wor=\r\nd reply, &quot;Good&quot;.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nAs we were walking back from Manikarn=\r\nika Manish suddenly said, &quot;There is a foreigner lady who lives close to Man=\r\nikarnika, who has a lot of desire to perform sadhanas in the samshan but do=\r\nes not know how to go about it. I saw her while meditating.&quot; For a woman to=\r\n come and perform these sadhanas is practically difficult or impossible, un=\r\nless she is a Yogini or a sadhaka of great calibre. Ordinary people would n=\r\not be able to meet the gaze of a Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, whe=\r\nn we came to the Lalita Ghat (as I mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, l=\r\nooking foreigner lady sitting on the banks. Manish quitely indicated to me =\r\nthat, that is the lady whom he had seen last night in his meditation at the=\r\n samshan. &quot;She has desire, but directionless. &quot; At that time there was noth=\r\ning more we could do. I guess that is why it is so important to keep doing =\r\nsome sadhana on your own, instead of merely contemplating which is of no go=\r\nod,=C2=A0so that you are ready when\n Nature decides to give you a push. \n=\r\n=C2=A0\nAfter passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,=C2=A0we stood and obs=\r\nerved Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed like any other tourist, =\r\nspecially with Manish&#39;s camera hanging from his neck=C2=A0and the=C2=A0trip=\r\nod. Manish smiled and said let us not go too close to Manikarnika, what if =\r\nthe doms recognize us! They would be shell shocked seeing us dressed as tou=\r\nrists, wondering what is going on.\n=C2=A0\nThus ended my second day of obser=\r\nving a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre at the famed Manikarnika Ghats of Kash=\r\ni.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\nRajarshi\n=C2=A0\n\n\nRama Naam Satya Hai\n\n\n\n\nThe INTERNET n=\r\now has a personality.

It is there that I read about=\r\n his meditating at the Manikarnika for 3 continuous days. He had left home =\r\nat the age of about 11/12 ( from bihar - where he was born) to become a won=\r\ndering monk and landed up in Kasi finally. When he came to Kasi he went to =\r\nthe Dasasmedha Ghat where he saw a lady - very well dress, decked in jewell=\r\nery - standing. The kind lady told him that she will take him to visit Vish=\r\nwanath, but before that asked him to take a bath in the water. As he came o=\r\nut of the Ganges water he saw the lady had bought some milk, ghee, flowers =\r\nand asked the young boy to accompany him as she lead him to the Kasi Vishwa=\r\nnath temple. Once they reached the Shiva Linga, the lady instructed him how=\r\n to do Abhisekha of the Linga with the stuff she had bought. After coming o=\r\nut of the temple, the lady kept walking along the lanes - VIshwanath Gali -=\r\n with the 11 year old boy following\n her. Suddenly infront of a huge gate, =\r\nthey stopped and the lady went inside. Baba Bhagwan Ram thought it must be =\r\nthe house of some rich person, and preferred to stand outside waiting. Plus=\r\n that was his first day in Kasi, and he had neither any money for anything =\r\nelse with him. After waiting there for a few hours, when the lady did not c=\r\nome out, he decided to enter through the gates. Once inside he realized tha=\r\nt it was not the house of a rich man but the famous Annapoorna temple. And =\r\nthere was no sign of that lady anywhere! Confused, he came out of the Vishw=\r\nanath Gali into the main road, when he saw that lady standing there again. =\r\nShe called him and asked him, what does he want. Bhagwan Ram said he wanted=\r\n to realize God. The lady instructed him to go to the Kinnarama Ashram, say=\r\ning there are paramhamsas who live there, you will find guidance there. Dev=\r\notees of Baba Bhagwan Ram believe that lady was none other than Ma Annapurn=\r\na.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Later, he was instructed in many Aghor Sadh=\r\nanas and spend years practising them. When he had been meditating at the Ma=\r\nnikarnika for three days - he used to live on the samshan like an Aghori - =\r\naround the age of 18/19 (I don&#39;t recollect exactly), he suddenly saw/felt/r=\r\nealized everything as millions of&nbsp;beautiful petals of concentric circl=\r\ne around a centre. He chose a few of the petals and came back to his normal=\r\n senses again. After that, he said, any slight desire that would arise in t=\r\nhe mind would immediately manifest. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;With age,=\r\n Baba Bhagawan Ram toured all along India and even went abroad telling peop=\r\nle about God realization and sadhana. He was the person who opened up the K=\r\ninnaram Ashram to ordinary people, before him the ashram never encouraged o=\r\nrdinary visitor. Even today, if&nbsp;you go there you will hardly find not =\r\nmore than 5/6 people at any given time.&nbsp;But his idea was to let people=\r\n come in and meditate inside the ashram premises. He made all sadhakas of t=\r\nhe ashram promise to become vegetarians and not use alcohol. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He died in 1990s (dont remember exact year). Some people co=\r\nnsider him to be a reincarnation of Baba Kinnaram.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;S=\r\nTRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR=\r\n: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;Rama Naama Satya Hai..&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Tue, 19/1/10, Kishore Chitrapu =\r\n&lt;I&gt;&lt;chitrapu@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;PADDI=\r\nNG-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nFrom: Kishore Chitrapu &lt;chitrapu@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Rama Naam Satya Hai - 3&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Cc: pv=\r\nr@..., rporuri@...&lt;BR&gt;Date: Tuesday, 19 January, 2010, 1:00 A=\r\nM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1422605402&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPA=\r\nN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rajarshi, your whole experien=\r\nce seems like an important move in the chess game that is being played by N=\r\nature.

I was writing in a flow and never checked what I wrote. Kindly pardon su=\r\nch errors and read through them. As they say, &quot;Bhavnayoko samjho!&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;During the day ti=\r\nme, we roamed around shooting at different places. In this 3 days we never =\r\nvisited any of the temples in Kasi. I asked him, &quot;What about the temples? W=\r\non&#39;t we visit them?&quot;. Manish retorted immediately, &quot;&nbsp;Aren&#39;t we&nbsp;go=\r\ning to the most powerful temple in Kasi every night?&quot;! I silently agreed. T=\r\nhis is something about Manish I have observed. He rarely enters temples or =\r\nstandard places of worship, but suddenly he might see a small roadside temp=\r\nle and stand and stare for sometimes, even do a pranam and then remark, &quot;Th=\r\nere is something here.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;During evening we went=\r\n to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Baba was a Aghori who lived in Kasi=\r\n&nbsp;during the 16th century. The place is called Aghor-sthal. Before ente=\r\nring Manish bought some bel leaves. As we walked inside the Ashram, Manish =\r\nbecame silent, then said there are strong energies in here. Inside we medit=\r\nated for sometime, Manish did&nbsp; pranam&nbsp;at the samadhi of Baba Bhag=\r\nwan Ram who was the 11th head of the Ashram. Baba Bhagwan Ram had entered N=\r\nirvikalpa Samadhi while meditating for 3 continuous days at the Manikarnika=\r\n Samshan.&nbsp; Manish, on being&nbsp;questioned, said that many sadhanas h=\r\nave been done here in this place for long by people with no mundane desires=\r\n. Therefore, the energies are strong here. While looking around the Ashram =\r\nwe found some quotations which were written in small wooden boards. Manish =\r\ncalled Arunisha and me and pointed to one quotation. Translated to English,=\r\n it read, &quot;If you have to give your head\n off to get a sadguru, you have&nb=\r\nsp;got it cheap&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;By 8 PM we sat for dinner. W=\r\ne used to have early dinners, so that we had sufficient time before going t=\r\no the samshan. Ideally you should have an empty stomach while performing an=\r\ny sadhana to get the best effects. The amount of fire in the body is fixed.=\r\n There is one that digests food - Jathara Agni. One that digests ideas/conc=\r\nepts/ experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential fire) which exists in the subtl=\r\ne body. It is the second which must increase in order for one to &quot;digest&quot; v=\r\narious experiences/ ideas/etc. It can only increase when the Jathara Agni i=\r\ns less, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. When we are extremely focused =\r\non something and working intently on the same, we forget food, we do not fe=\r\nel hungry. This is due to the increase in Bhuta Agni and decrease in Jathar=\r\na Agni.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As we sat eating our food and talking =\r\non different topics, we discussed history.The conversation mentioned here i=\r\ns a thread picked up from an earlier conversation that we (Manish, Arunisha=\r\n and&nbsp;me) had before coming to Kasi. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Mani=\r\nsh said, &quot;It is the same set of&nbsp;souls who come back&nbsp;again and aga=\r\nin in different bodies and personalities at different times, who&nbsp;are r=\r\nesponsible for this land. There was Chadragupta and Chanakya, there was Pri=\r\nthviraj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna etc.&quot; He continued, &quot;=\r\nThey can come as kings, yogis, or any other form which is necessary for the=\r\nm to accomplish their dharma. And their dharma is connected to this land&nb=\r\nsp;which we call India&nbsp;today.This land is connected to the Rishis. Thi=\r\ns is Rishi bhoomi. And Rishis sent people when needed.&nbsp;Prithviraj made=\r\n one mistake, of pardoning Ghori. Imagine what happened to that woman who m=\r\nade Prithiviraj disobey his Guru?&quot;.I silently contemplated her fate.&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;One very senior Rishi has decided to&nbsp;cha=\r\nnge this land back to a Rishi bhoomi. And so shall it happen.&nbsp;Ved&nbsp=\r\n;Dharma will be re established here along the length and breadth. Nothing, =\r\nhowever powerful or mightly, be it an individual or&nbsp;group,&nbsp;can st=\r\nand against the will of a Rishi.&quot;&nbsp; Arunisha asked a pertinent question=\r\n here. &quot;What were the Rishis doing for&nbsp;one thousand years?&quot;. Manish la=\r\nughed and said, &quot; A Rishi can very well spend a thousand years simply in sa=\r\nmadhi, meditating. Then suddenly&nbsp;one day&nbsp;wake up from meditation&=\r\nnbsp;and see that Rishi bhoomi is gone&nbsp;and all sorts of non-spiritual =\r\nthings going on here. So He decides, it is time to get back and re create t=\r\nhe Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no clue about&nbsp;what a Rishi can do. One =\r\nRishi is enough to change a universe, changing a country is child&#39;s play fo=\r\nr Him.&quot; Wow. I let all these sink inside me slowly. Therefore it is so impo=\r\nrtant to keep\n doing sadhana, in some manner or the other.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As night approached midnight, Manish and I left for the Manika=\r\nrnika again. This was going be our last night of Chandi homa at Manikarnika=\r\n, for now. We walked long the&nbsp;deserted ghats, sliently. I asked him if=\r\n it is ok doing a&nbsp;homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said&nbsp;yes w=\r\nhy not, but without Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the divine =\r\nfeminie is the most practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the state of hi=\r\nghest consciousness, and to reach that stage one must develop his body and =\r\nmind such that it can hold shakti&nbsp;for which&nbsp;worshipping the divin=\r\ne Mother is the best way.&nbsp;That is why Vimalananda says, &quot;Let the Mothe=\r\nr show you the face of the Father&quot;. The topic drifted to Vimalananda. Manis=\r\nh said, &quot;Kala Bhairava is very strong in Manikarnika, where as Mahakala exi=\r\nsts powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujjain. But Vimalananda did Mahak=\r\nala sadhana here in Manikarnika.&quot; Then staring at the pitch black ganges,\n =\r\nManish chuckled lightly and added, &quot;That man was something.&quot; This was again=\r\n an old conversation we had started&nbsp;before which Mainsh continued, &quot;Al=\r\nl these babas of today would wet their pants if Vimalananda were to stand i=\r\nnfornt of them. Those three books have the power of a deity flowing through=\r\n them. Without being physically present, Vimalananda has created a army of =\r\nsadhakas!&quot;. I interjected, &quot;The books&nbsp;are like a Bible&nbsp;for sadhak=\r\nas,&nbsp;arn&#39;t they?&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot; said Manish. Later on I asked him if it was po=\r\nssible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to which Manish replied that yes it =\r\nwas, if one does serious sadhana. However, the important question is whethe=\r\nr one will be able to recognize him. I fell silent hearing this. Interestin=\r\ngly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vimalanda does mention that a ti=\r\nme will come when his &quot;children&quot; would spread homas. Strange, or maybe not =\r\nso. Who knows how deep things run. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;We reached=\r\n the samshan by half past twelve. This time we sat at the same place where =\r\nwe had sat on the first day of homa. The fire was low. Most of the body had=\r\n been burnt already. Manish started the homa. As usual, all the dogs came a=\r\nnd sat peacefully around the fire. Now this did not surprise me any more. I=\r\nn the middle of the homa Manish would slowly lift his&nbsp;palm upwards&nbs=\r\np;and with the next ahuti&nbsp;immediately the fire would leap higher. He d=\r\nid this quite a few times, when&nbsp;the flames were getting weaker. I coun=\r\ntinued with the Chandi path and passing on the samagri to him as and when h=\r\ne required anything. One dom who was working on a pyre nearby, came towards=\r\n us and exclaimed,&quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. Manish too responded back, &quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. =\r\nThis homa was faster. He did not use any &quot;samputs&quot;, but a direct, straight =\r\nChandi homa. Again in the middle I got up and stroked the pyre a bit, pushi=\r\nng around some of the coconut pieces to make them\n burn properly. I was enj=\r\noying it. A few people came and sat near us, listening to the path. In Kasi=\r\n there is a rule that whatever comes in the Samshan is the property of the =\r\nDom Raja (the head of doms). No one has any further claim on it. In old tim=\r\nes, one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. He was an Aghori and a contemporary =\r\nof Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could raise the dead back to life. Maybe it=\r\n is because of this tradition that Manikarnika is such an apt place for the=\r\nse sadhanas. I was at one point mentally wondering why are there so many pe=\r\nople in the samshan. The Manish said, if a Nath came here in his garb, ever=\r\nyone will run away from the samshan scared. But there is a reason why there=\r\n are people here even so late in the night.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;On=\r\nce the final purnahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Though this homa g=\r\not over faster than previous days, the meditation that happened, for me, wa=\r\ns superb. At one point I felt as if my mind would just burst forth and expa=\r\nnd across the length and breadth of the Ganges. My focus was good, but I ha=\r\nd to open my eyes after every 20 minutes or so. Manish continued meditating=\r\n for nearly an hour. Not the slightest movement from him. Nothing. Still li=\r\nke a stone. Then a cow came and slightly nudged Manish on his feet. That ma=\r\nde him open his eyes. Manish remarked, &quot; I could have just left my body and=\r\n gone off. It did not matter that I had a flight to catch the next day, or =\r\nanything else. I was on the verge of death. Just at that moment the cow and=\r\n brought me back.&quot; Smiling he added, &quot;What a sight it would have been for t=\r\nhe people to see, how the body can be left at will&quot;.&nbsp; I did not know w=\r\nhat to say. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;We stood there watching another p=\r\nyre in front. The body was half burnt. The torso had become black with deep=\r\n&nbsp;red patches all over. The dom came forward, and with the bamboo stick=\r\n inserted it (the bamboo stick)&nbsp;from the side of the corpse, lifting u=\r\np the burning torso into the air and placing it again, strategically, in th=\r\ne middle of the pyre. The smooth&nbsp;motion of lifting up the half burnt t=\r\norso, sticking out from one end of the bamboo stick,&nbsp;into the thin, da=\r\nrk, night-air reminded me of how we use a fork to lift pieces of food - mea=\r\nt&nbsp;or vegetables, both dead -&nbsp;from our plates to our mouths. Manis=\r\nh asked me smiling, &quot;Maza aya?&quot;. I smiled back in acknowledgement. Then he =\r\ncommented&nbsp;that I should write about this experience in the coming days=\r\n. Let people know.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;By this time I remembered t=\r\nhat when I was sitting and doing the Chandi path, one dog&nbsp;had run off =\r\nwith one of my chappals. I informed Manish. He exclaimed, &quot; Kya baat hai! L=\r\neave the other chappal here as well.&quot; Manish said we had a rna with this sa=\r\nmshan. We had been here before, in some life.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\nAs we were returning, Manish said one of the point (the three peaks)&nbsp;o=\r\nf Shiva&#39;s trishul passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it is a &quot;safe&quot;=\r\n samshan. Anyone who tries anything negative here will face troubles. The t=\r\nrishul of Shiva guards this place. No spirit will cause any unnecessary dis=\r\nturbance inside the samshan. That is also why there are people here even at=\r\n 2 am in the morning. There is safety in numbers. As long as ones intention=\r\ns are genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wonderful place to do sadhana.&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While walking along the ghats&nbsp;which were&nbs=\r\np;totally deserted, Manish instructed me not to stop. The knot in my red lu=\r\nngi was becoming loose, I caught hold of it&nbsp;with one&nbsp;hand and kep=\r\nt moving fast, trying to keep pace with Manish. Later Manish asked me if I =\r\nhad got some smell. I thought and recollected that yes, I did get a faint s=\r\nmell of heena. Twice. Manish told me it was a &quot;Mokul&quot;. A muslim spirit of s=\r\nimilar level as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once the ritual is over, and you ar=\r\ne out of the samshan, do not wait along the banks, he instructed. Do not mo=\r\nve too close to the water&nbsp;late in the nightt. There are things in the =\r\nwater. Generally they may not do anything, but why take a chance. The prote=\r\nction of Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya =\r\nBaba (I may have mis-spelt the name) used to live in the middle of this Gan=\r\nges 24/7. This is a city of saints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas would =\r\nroam around\n naked. It is their city.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Next mor=\r\nning, as we sat recollecting the previous night&#39;s homa, Manish talked about=\r\n Vedas.&nbsp;Few sadhaks, if ever, are equally comfortable with both paths =\r\nof&nbsp;Aghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra to show its effects, one must g=\r\net the intonation perfect. This age most people cannot do that. I&nbsp;enqu=\r\nired that I had heard from someone that a certain procedure needs to be don=\r\ne before one starts any sadhana in the samshan. Manish&nbsp;laughed and rep=\r\nlied,&nbsp;&quot;Karna to sab kuch chahiye, par mujhe to kuch nehi aata!&quot;.&nbsp;=\r\nI was dumbstruck.&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;While talking about Ra=\r\nmayana with Arunisha, his eyes suddenly become half closed. He voice became=\r\n slow and heavy,&nbsp;&quot;The color of Rama&#39;s body is deep blue with a golden =\r\ntinge all&nbsp;around him. Like a sun blazing. That&nbsp;was the kavacha gi=\r\nven to Rama by Vishwamitra, the real Gayatri with two special samputs. It w=\r\nas impenetrable. And when he shot his arrows, the motion of his hands&nbsp;=\r\nis so fast that a normal human eye will not able to observe. In 12 hours he=\r\n had destroyed a forest of Ashuras.&nbsp;Ravana had a Chandrahaas khadga. I=\r\nt was a&nbsp;mantra shakti he had acquired through sadhana. The Khadga had =\r\nbecome part of his right hand, which would fly off to kill mercilessly at t=\r\nhe slightest&nbsp;command from his mind. Such was the calibre of the enemy.=\r\n &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;And Rama removed even&nbsp;his Gayatri Kavac=\r\nha, and fought like a normal human being when he defeated Ravana which&nbsp=\r\n;means; he even removed the last vestige of his ego of being a God, and fou=\r\nght like a human. Is it any wonder then, that the whole of north India goes=\r\n crazy at the mere mention of the name of Sri Rama?&quot;. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;He spoke with such an energy which cannot be defined, as if he was=\r\n there and seen it all. Rama Naam Satya Hai.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;T=\r\nhus ends my recounting of our fascinating trip to Kasi.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;B&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAM=\r\nILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#=\r\n00007f&gt;Rama Naama Satya Hai..&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Sat, 16/1/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;I&gt;&lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.m=\r\nc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Drajarshi14@...&quot; target=3D_blank =\r\nrel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@...&quot;&gt;rajarshi14@yahoo. =\r\nco.in&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,1=\r\n6,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: rajarshi nandy &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.ma=\r\nil.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Drajarshi14@...&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3D=\r\nnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@...&quot;&gt;rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Rama Naam Satya Hai - 2&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Date: Saturday, 16 January, =\r\n2010, 11:25 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpa=\r\ncing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;De=\r\nar Narasimha&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;I&gt;It may sound weird, but this i=\r\ns what happens in real life all the time. You, I, all these people are piec=\r\nes in another kind of chess game. &lt;/I&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Great a=\r\nnalogy. Manish had given this analogy to us after he&nbsp;completed a beaut=\r\niful&nbsp;Ganapati homa last August. There is&nbsp;one divine chess player,=\r\n and it is totally His game. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Before I continu=\r\ne with the narration, I would like to mention a few points which I found I =\r\nhad not clearly mentioned in my last mail:&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;\n&lt;LI=\r\n&gt;At the end of the third day of Chandi homa at Manikarnika samshan, we were=\r\n standing and watching the pyres burn, when Manish suddenly said, in the co=\r\nming days you will write about this experience in a public forum. Therefore=\r\n my mails.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;\n&lt;LI&gt;&lt;B&gt;Caveat&lt;/B&gt;: A homa on a =\r\nfuneral pyre is an extreme Aghor&nbsp;sadhana, and it is not entirely risk =\r\nfree. Infact, in many paramparas it is said&nbsp;only someone who has a dir=\r\nect agya from Samshan Kali or Mahakala can try this procedure, or someone w=\r\nho has agya from a powerful Guru. It was Manish who was doing the homa, (gi=\r\nving ahutis)&nbsp;I was only doing the Chandi Path. Therefore, by reading t=\r\nhis accounts one should not, on his own, try out this sadhana. &lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;\n&lt;LI&gt;Many people have a negative&nbsp;bias towards Agh=\r\nor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due to lack of knowledge or understa=\r\nnding of the philosophy and efficacy of these sadhanas. Moreover, in recent=\r\n time some TV channels too have made films etc of Aghoris, potraying them a=\r\ns perverted individuals. This is grossly incorrect. They have no clue what =\r\nthey are talking about, and their accounts start with many preconcieved bia=\r\nses. Aghora is one of the many path to the reach the same goals - Self-real=\r\nization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a path. Some like it, some don&#39;t=\r\n. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen path but at the same time have a h=\r\nealthy respect for other paths too. Many great saints and spiritual giants =\r\nhave taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is considered the first Aghori. The 9=\r\n great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Swami was an Aghori too. Vimala=\r\nnada was a master Aghori. My mails are intended to give a first hand\n objec=\r\ntive&nbsp;account of how a powerful sadhana in the samshan is performed. No=\r\nthing more. I am just the cronicler.&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;UL&gt;\n&lt;LI&gt;T=\r\nhere are many people in this age who have a desire for these sadhanas, who =\r\nfeel an attraction for this kind of a path, but have no clue how to go abou=\r\nt it. These accounts are ment to tell such&nbsp;people that these sadhanas =\r\ncan and do happen even today, it is not a figment of imagination. The Manik=\r\narnika is still as powerful as it was thousands of years ago. But to go abo=\r\nut it and&nbsp;actually be able to do this sadhana, just like everything el=\r\nse in life, there is no fixed procedures or rules. Keep doing sadhana in wh=\r\natever condition you are in right now&nbsp;and let Nature decide. Like Sai =\r\nBaba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and patience. If the desire is genui=\r\nne and deep, and one is ready to wait, Nature will one day make arrangement=\r\ns. This is the eternal promise to every individual&nbsp;because for Her, NO=\r\nTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so&nbsp;kind.&nbsp; In the intruduction to =\r\n&quot;Aghora - At the left hand of God&quot;, Vimalanada says :&lt;/LI&gt;&lt;/UL&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE=\r\n dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE dir=3Dltr&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;Publish this book after I am gone.=\r\n Let people know the truth. Let them know what is what. Out of the thousand=\r\ns who may read it at least a few will be sincere. They will try to learn mo=\r\nre, and then Nature Herself will make arrangements for them to learn just a=\r\ns She did for me, and they will be taught according to their capabilities. =\r\n&lt;U&gt;The progression will go on; there is nothing to fear&lt;/U&gt;&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQ=\r\nUOTE&gt;\n&lt;P dir=3Dltr&gt;Therefore have faith, do sadhana.&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Back to the narration. The second da=\r\ny was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Manish said it is a powerful night fo=\r\nr chita homa. Various shaktis are available on this night which can destroy=\r\n Ashuras.&nbsp;Past midnight we were walking towards Manikarnika along the =\r\nghats. Not a single person was to be seen anywhere on any of the multitude =\r\nof ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found a pack of dogs, fighting among=\r\n each other, blocking our path. We stopped, wondering if there was any alte=\r\nrnate route to the samshan. I started mentally chanting a mantra I knew and=\r\n praying to the deity to make our journey smooth. Coincidentally, just at t=\r\nhat moment we saw a man coming from the other side who chased the dogs away=\r\n.&nbsp;Without looking at me&nbsp;Manish said, &quot;Sometimes a simple prayer c=\r\nan work wonders but never become to big for your breeches&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish said this is a wonderful =\r\nplace.&nbsp;I did not think too much about it then since my mind was alread=\r\ny pre occupied with the thoughts of what is to come. The next day morning w=\r\nhen we again came to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting, I suddenly felt a p=\r\nressure on my head, and then everything became calm. Manish smiled at me an=\r\nd said this is where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya and the energies are s=\r\ntill here. I was little skeptical mentally, since I knew that the samadhi o=\r\nf Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, however I did not say anything.&n=\r\nbsp;Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who was from Beneras an=\r\nd that person confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to stay at the Lali=\r\nta Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed idiot.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Back to midnight. We reached Manikarnika and again it was=\r\n filled with people. But this time we did not wait. We went right inside, a=\r\nnd Manish kept looking for a suitable chita. As we came in, again people st=\r\narted staring at us, but they respectfully made way for us to pass through =\r\nto the middle of the samshan. We stood exactly at the middle, with Manish o=\r\nbserving the different chitas. There were about 8/10 of them burning. It is=\r\n said in thousands of years there has not been a single minute when there h=\r\nas not been a body burning in here. Therefore it is one of the Mahasamshans=\r\n in India. There was one chita to my right which Manish was observing, when=\r\n suddenly I found a mega size bull come and stand right next to the fire. I=\r\n did not want to sit there, the bull looked dangerous. Before I could voice=\r\n my concern, Manish said let us go to the other side of the samshan. It not=\r\n only the bull,&nbsp; but there is something else as well. I did not ask hi=\r\nm\n what. So we went to another side. The dom there came forward and said to=\r\n Manish, &quot;Baba,aap log&nbsp;kaun se chita me baithna chahate ho?&quot;. Manish i=\r\nndicated one at the end, the dome then went ahead and asked the people stan=\r\nding around the chita to make space for us to sit. He said the heat from th=\r\ne fire is too stong, b\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
