These=\r\n writings are free-wheeling in nature and not well-organized.\n&gt;  \n&gt; On 2010=\r\n Guru Pournima, my Jyotish students in Boston gifted me a book they created=\r\n out of some of those writings. They organized the writings topically in th=\r\ne form of a book.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A lot of topics that may be of interest to spiritua=\r\nl seekers are addressed in one place, in a *somewhat* organized form. A lot=\r\n of questions from members were answered in simple language and several sub=\r\ntle issues were addressed.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The book in PDF format is only 1.5 MB in s=\r\nize and is FREE to download.
