What i came to real=\r\nize is that there are obstructors or so called entities which we have attra=\r\ncted due to our karmic propensities. And by reciting kavacham like Chandi k=\r\navacha or Sri Sudarshana kavacha that i was able by the grace to repel such=\r\n entities or my attraction to situations that caused a fall and retrieve my=\r\n innermost natural sense of goodness.  The whole point is that no matter wh=\r\nat is going on or who or what is &#39;out there&#39; i will not succumb to the doub=\r\nt that God is removed from me.  That only seems to make the problem worse w=\r\nith bad results.

Kindly do not judge me based on my condition, rather=\r\n give me some positive solution and perspective to what I am going through.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a very strong beloved of god and a very strong devotee. I love t=\r\no worship him as much as I can.however, all my passion, interest seems to g=\r\net drained and discouraged due to my mindset and the hell I go through beca=\r\nuse of it. I always , always get negative & abusive thoughts and tie those =\r\nto the god. For ex, if I hear a foul language, see a negative thing, bad or=\r\n foul my mind relates or ties it to god. My mind start abusing god with the=\r\n same foul language.\n&gt; When I do Japam, =A0my mind would not get concentrat=\r\nion, but goes into this evil mode with racing thoughts.\n&gt; I can&#39;t see direc=\r\ntly into the eyes of god with the fear of my mind abusing him I can&#39;t focus=\r\n my drishti on god statues. My thoughts are extremely foul...most specially=\r\n foul language. However, I battle my thoughts with my worship, which means =\r\nI don&#39;t give up praying him. I requested him several times to relive me fro=\r\nm such pain so that I can increase my devotion and prayers. I love him. I w=\r\nant to pray him.=A0\n&gt; Currently, my mind and it&#39;s racing evil & foul though=\r\nts have become a road block in my devotion and trying to keep me away from =\r\nhim as much as possible.
