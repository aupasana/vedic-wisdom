Please take the below only as =\r\nsomething that has been gathered from books and so that the nagging questio=\r\nn in your mind is laid to rest.Learned members can kindly correct if any mi=\r\nstakes are done in intrepretation.\n\nOften this question can also take the f=\r\norm of &quot; Why should god have an ugra roopa....should not god always be calm=\r\n patient...loving &quot;\n\nWhether that is the case or is it a case of the observ=\r\ner attributing these qualities to god is a also a valid question. Often app=\r\nearances are deceptive.\n\n1.Tantra has six rites of destruction as well ( Ma=\r\nrana , Ucchatana,Vidveshana...etc etc ) . Also tantra has abhichara prayoga=\r\ns to cause the destruction of enemies.\n\nTwo instances where it has been men=\r\ntioned in the classics is \n\n2.Meghanada the son of Ravana begins an Abhicha=\r\nra homa which if completed would have made him invincible.Lord Hanuman and =\r\nLakshmana stop the homa before it is completed and slay Meghanada.\n\n3.Sudak=\r\nshina son of Vasudeva of Kasi ( Vasudeva is killed by Krishna in the battle=\r\n of Kasi) does an Abhichara and sends an fiend to attack Krishna in Dwaraka=\r\n. Krishna repels the Fiend and with any Abhichara when repelled it will tur=\r\nn against the one who has intiated it. Kasi is burnt down and this is menti=\r\noned as the incident of Kasi burnt by Krishna.\n\n\nThe six destructive rites =\r\nare only to be used for specific purposes relating to war , these are not r=\r\nites for ordinary human beings. They carry terrible terrible consequences.\n=\r\n\nLeft hand tantra ( Please note Left hand is not used in any derogatory sen=\r\nse) contains similar other practises as well....\n\nTake for example : Vashik=\r\narana...and Bali \n\nThe rite itself has many variations and many purposes. U=\r\nsed on a lower level it is used to control others to do your bidding...Used=\r\n on a higher level it can attract a bhairavi ...whom if you have the right =\r\nattitude you can accept as a mother and learn a lot from.\n\n\nVimalananda has=\r\n also clarified the use of Bali. In the pure sense the surrender of ego....=\r\nBut he has also clarified the use of pashu bali.....\n\nKamakhya one of the m=\r\nost sacred Pithas of the Goddess does an yearly bali of goats....Yet it is =\r\nsaid to be one of the most peaceful places on earth to meditate . Only goat=\r\ns with special markings on their bodies are used....when the priest does th=\r\ne bali he is directly sending them to the abode of kali..In a way it is a b=\r\noon for the being in the body of the goat.It will surely come back as a hum=\r\nan being.\n\n\n\nJust like a forest fire appears destructive on the surface ...=\r\n.but it is a proven scientific fact that the growth of trees is highest aft=\r\ner a forest fire occurs .\n\n\nTantra especially the Left hand kind is not for=\r\n the faint of heart...nor is it for the timid in mind. Vimalananda in the v=\r\nery beginning had to do a shava sadhana before he could have a vision of hi=\r\ns most compassionate Smashana Tara.\n\n\nIt is a very powerful path with rapid=\r\n progress but the pitfalls are many without the guidance of a Sadhguru...pr=\r\nobably the reason Tantra was heavily put down later in the later period whe=\r\nn most traditions got distorted.\n\n\nMy Two Cents\n\nRam Kishore \n\n\n\n\n--- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bivash Ramroop&quot; &lt;bivaash108@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Om=\r\n Brihaspataye Namah\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji and members, \n&gt; Namaste and Hare =\r\nKrishna\n&gt; \n&gt; Recently I was chatting to someone online that mentioned indra=\r\njal. I gathered from our chat that it was something to do with black magic.=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; When I got home today, I asked my grandmother and she refused to tel=\r\nl me what it was. I googled it and came across as it being a book of tantra=\r\n dealing with the darker aspects- potential to damage others. \n&gt; \n&gt; On one =\r\nof the books, there is a picture of Ma Kali. And one shop that sells it onl=\r\nine mentions Das MahaVidya.\n&gt; \n&gt; So my question is, if all these mantras th=\r\nat exist that can harm other people, who empowers these mantras? I really f=\r\nind it hard to believe that Ma will give power to people to harm others. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I do know from Vedic stories about devas granting boons to demons, for =\r\nexample- Hiranyakashipu&#39;s story. But, considering we are in Kali Yuga, does=\r\n this still happen? People are more likely to die from AIDS, cancer etc, so=\r\n whats the big deal with black magic? Is this just childish superstition or=\r\n all part of a larger work of karma?\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for the questions, its just=\r\n been annoying me at the back of my mind. \n&gt; \n&gt; Jaya Sita Raama\n&gt; Bivash\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
