In the following\nvideotap=\r\ned interview, taken in Madras by Graham Boyd in March, 1999, she\npours out =\r\nher experiences and insights. These are only excerpts translated\nfrom Tamil=\r\n by V. Swaminathan of New York.\n\nHow to speak?\n\nThe next day I wanted to go=\r\n for a pradakshina around Arunachala. As I could\nnot go alone, Anandammal w=\r\nould accompany me. When I went to take Bhagavan&#39;s\npermission at about 5 a.m=\r\n., no one else was present. I thought that this\nwould be my best opportunit=\r\ny to speak to Bhagavan. As I prostrate before\nhim, I thought, &quot;What do I as=\r\nk him?&quot; On such occasions, I would think, &quot;What\ndo you know? What will you =\r\nask this divine being at whose very sight you\nbecome tongue-tied?&quot; All my q=\r\nuestions would then remained bottled-up inside\nme. On that day, somehow mus=\r\ntering courage, I managed to speak out,\n&quot;Bhagavan! I am going for pradakshi=\r\nna.&quot; I did not know what else to say.\nBhagavan, who was reclining on the so=\r\nfa came forward towards me and said,\n&quot;Uh! What?&quot; I then realized that altho=\r\nugh I requested permission to go for\npradakshina, no sound came from my mou=\r\nth. Only my lips moved. Again, I tried\ntelling Bhagavan, with the same resu=\r\nlt. Bhagavan then said, &quot;Oho! So you are\ngoing for the pradakshina? Who is =\r\naccompanying you?&quot; Anandammal, who had\ncome to the hall by then and was sta=\r\nnding beside me said, &quot;Bhagavan, I am\ngoing.&quot; Bhagavan said &quot;Very Good! Ver=\r\ny Good&quot; and gave a beatific smile. Thus,\ndespite several opportunities to d=\r\no so, I was never able to speak to\nBhagavan. So how could I ask him anythin=\r\ng? And what was I to ask? Some\npeople told me to ask him whatever doubts ca=\r\nme to me in my sadhana. But then\nit would occur to me that If we did sadhan=\r\na the way Bhagavan asked us to,\nthen there is absolutely no room for doubt.=\r\n Such doubts are only on account\nof our own mistakes in not following Bhaga=\r\nvan. Thus, I never asked Bhagavan\nany questions.\n\nLook of Grace\n\nThis incid=\r\nent took place when Bhagavan had moved into the new hall. During\nthose days=\r\n, the front row closest to Bhagavan was reserved for important\npeople, alth=\r\nough Bhagavan did not know about it. There was a specific\nunspoken seating =\r\narrangement and others who occupied those places would even\nbe asked to go =\r\nand sit elsewhere. On this day, Rani Mazumdar and myself were\nsitting by th=\r\ne window at the end of the hall when we noticed that the front\nrow was empt=\r\ny. Rani suggested that the two of us could sit there close to\nBhagavan. I a=\r\ngreed. The front row would begin at the pillars closest to\nBhagavan&#39;s couch=\r\n. No one could sit right beside the couch in order to give\npeople room to m=\r\nove about. On seeing the two of us, a telugu lady called\nKameswaramma also =\r\ncame and sat next to us in the front row. The three of us\nwere directly fac=\r\ning Bhagavan.\n\nAs soon as we had settled there, Bhagavan began looking dire=\r\nctly at me.\nUnable to bear the intensity of his direct look, I immediately =\r\nclosed my\neyes. How long I remained like that I do not know, but sometime l=\r\nater, I\nopened my eyes and found Bhagavan seated motionless looking at me j=\r\nust as\nbefore. Again I closed my eyes. Sometime later, Mauni Srinivasa Rao =\r\ncame\nwith the day&#39;s mail. Hearing Bhagavan talk to him, I opened my eyes.\nH=\r\nowever, I was still in the same state that I was in when my eyes were\nclose=\r\nd and whatever was happening didn&#39;t really register in my mind. After\natten=\r\nding to the correspondence, Bhagavan got up to leave for the cow shed.\nI go=\r\nt up along with everybody else but again without any real awareness of\nmy s=\r\nurroundings.\n\nKameswaramma, who was sitting next to me, hugged me and said,=\r\n &quot;Kanakamma,\nyou are extremely fortunate. Ever since you sat there, Bhagava=\r\nn has been\nsteadily looking directly at you up until the Mauni came with th=\r\ne mail. You\nhave got everything. Bhagavan has given you all that you need.&quot;=\r\n So saying,\nshe hugged me close to her. But I was in no state to give a rep=\r\nly. I just\ntold her, &quot;Tears are streaming down my eyes. I don&#39;t know what t=\r\no say.&quot; The\nwaves of peace coming over me kept me from talking.\n\nAs the min=\r\nd tends to go out, turn it inwards then and there. It goes out\nowing to the=\r\n habit of looking for happiness outside oneself; but the\nknowledge that the=\r\n external objects are not the cause of happiness will keep\nit in check. Thi=\r\ns is vairagya or dispassion. Only after perfect vairagya the\nmind becomes s=\r\nteady.\n\n=E2=80=94Talks With Sri Ramana Maharshi, No. 344\n\nSource: http://ww=\r\nw.arunachala.org/newsletters/2000/?pg=3Dmar-apr\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =\r\n=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =\r\n =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd106c011e8260482eaeca0\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nSrimati Kanakamma doesn&#39;t need much coaxing to speak about t=\r\nhe wonder of Sri Bhagavan and the blessings he showered on her.
