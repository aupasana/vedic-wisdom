I had\nbooked a Ganesha homam and abhishekam in the Aswatha Vinayaka temple,\nT.Nagar, Madras. This temple was for many years run by an old priest and I\nremember as a small child partaking of the extremely delicious panchamrita\nthat the old priest made with his bare hands. Now the baton has passed to\nhis sons and one son was conducting the homam in the temple.\n\nAfter the sankalpam, invocation etc., the priest got ready to make the\nofferings for each mantra recited. He used what appeared to be the dried\ngarlands of flowers from the idol. I was thinking why is he using such items\ninstead of havan samagri or someother items. To my surprise, when the priest\nadded the dried garlands, the fire blazed up suddenly and my wife, sitting\nby the side of me, involuntarily stepped back a few inches! This taught me a\ngood lesson that I should leave it to the fire to judge what it likes and\nwhat it doesnt like! I guess the vibrations from the garlands that\npreviously adorned the idol were so powerful that the fire accepted it\ngleefully!\n\nAnother interesting thing was that the fire continued to blaze vigorously\nand burnt for a long time after the poornahuti offering was completed.\n\nbest regards\nHari\n\r\n--001636426a592e3972046db825bf\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n|om namo bhagavate venkatesaaya|&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear Narasimha, namaste and pranaam=\r\ns&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;While on this thread, I wish to share a recent interesting experie=\r\nnce.
