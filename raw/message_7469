At this stage you might add ground saffron, as=\r\n well\n&gt; &gt; - just be sure to let it soak, if you do.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you are usi=\r\nng a small amount (1 tsp to 1 Tbsp), put into the microwave\n&gt; &gt; for approxi=\r\nmately 15-30 seconds. You might check it every 10 seconds or so,\n&gt; &gt; depend=\r\ning on how much you&#39;ve made. If you are making more, you&#39;ll have to\n&gt; &gt; adj=\r\nust the timing accordingly and stir every 10-15 seconds.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When it&#39;s=\r\n turned a brilliant red, you&#39;re done.

I&#39;m guessing that most people either buy ghee=\r\n, or melt it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on a stove. There is another option that I use -- a smal=\r\nl crock pot.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Materials:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (a) Glass jar that will fit a sta=\r\nndard 16oz block of butter e.g.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Presso Storage Jars, 2.5 liters&quot;.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; (b) A small crock pot that will fit the glass jar e.g. &quot;Little Dipper\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Warmer Crock Pot&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (c) butter e.g. individually wrapped 16 oz br=\r\nicks.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All you have to do is unwrap 1 or 2 of the 16 oz bricks o=\r\nf butter and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; put it in the glass jar. Put the jar in the crock pot an=\r\nd cover it. In\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the morning (i.e. 4-6 hours later), you&#39;ll have ghee w=\r\nith some curds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; at the bottom. You can carefully pour out the ghee int=\r\no another vessel\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and throw out the curds at the bottom with very litt=\r\nle waste. There is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; no need for a strainer or anything else if you are=\r\n careful.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The glass bottle and relatively low heat make it easy=\r\n to clean up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since the ghee has been slowly melted over a period of =\r\ntime, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; retains the heat for much longer when compared to microwavin=\r\ng it. If\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you have left over ghee, you can simply put it in any glass =\r\nbottle\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that will fit in the crock pot, and then remelt it overnight f=\r\nor the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; next morning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This is the simplest, cleanest, chea=\r\npest solution that I&#39;ve come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; across. If there are any other methods, =\r\nplease share ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sasneham,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ajit\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
