Thank you very much for providing such ritua=\r\nl information to beginners like me!\n\nI have a question, however, pertaining=\r\n to one of the technical aspects of the ritual. When one is supposed to tak=\r\ne water in the right hand, directly from the pot or with the help of a spoo=\r\nn, one is supposed to recite the mantra and then release the water in the s=\r\naid direction (as mentioned in the manual) However, as soon as I took some =\r\nwater in my right hand, and before I could finish reciting the mantra(s), s=\r\nome water kept slipping out of the hand. Does this happen often/is it okay =\r\nor is this an error/non-acceptable?\n\nIs their a video recording of this rit=\r\nual?\n\nThanks and best regards,\nManish\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm, &quot;vaswanimanish&quot; &lt;vaswanimanish@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Shri Narasimhaji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Na=\r\nmaste!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your quick replies! \n&gt; \n&gt; However, I saw these re=\r\nplies only now, when I am at work. How I wish I had seen them in the mornin=\r\ng today. With Prabhu Ramakrishna&#39;s jayanti tithi running, today is surely a=\r\n blessed day for spiritual progress. Can the tarpana ritual be performed in=\r\n the evenings as well or does it have to be performed in the mornings only?=\r\n If yes, how late can it be performed? I normally return home by 10 in the =\r\nnight. So, if possible, I would like to perform the tarpana tonight and the=\r\nn perform my evening prayers and then have food. \n&gt; \n&gt; One last clarificati=\r\non, your last response to my query regarding black sesame seeds for Pitris;=\r\n so, one should put sesame seeds in the water already containing akshatas a=\r\nnd give tarpana to Pitris with the water containing akshatas and sesame see=\r\nds? Is that the correct understanding?\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Manish\n&gt; \n&gt; ---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1.

He was b=\r\norn on Sukla paksha dwitiya tithi of the lunar \n&gt; &gt; month of Phalguna. That=\r\n lunar day is running right now! It was 6 years \n&gt; &gt; back on the same lunar=\r\n day that Manish and I took sankalpa for a 7-day \n&gt; &gt; Shata Chandi homam in=\r\n Chennai, where the seed for homam movement was \n&gt; &gt; sowed. By an unplanned=\r\n coincidence, the fraction of the tithi left when \n&gt; &gt; we took sankalpa mat=\r\nched the fraction of tithi left when Ramakrishna was \n&gt; &gt; born.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Om=\r\n Hreem Namo Bhagavate Ramakrishnaya.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; On Wed, Feb 22, 2012 at 10:29 AM, vaswanimanish wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     =\r\nShri Narasimhaji,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you very much for the ta=\r\nrpana manuals!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I want to perform the Deva, Rishi and Pitri tarpana=\r\n as per the manual \n&gt; &gt; prepared by you. However, I missed the Amavasya day=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. As per the manual, this tarpana can be performed on any day, =\r\nany \n&gt; &gt; week, any fortnight, and every month but there are some special da=\r\nys as \n&gt; &gt; well. Is it fine to start from the coming Saturday/Sunday and th=\r\nen \n&gt; &gt; perform it every fortnight?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. In the manual, after the Ri=\r\nshi tarpana section, one moves to Divya \n&gt; &gt; Manushya tarpana. Here, one is=\r\n supposed to use the same water pot \n&gt; &gt; containing the akshatas as in the =\r\nearlier Rishi tarpana section?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. After the Divya Manushya tarpana=\r\n, one moves to the Divya Pitri and \n&gt; &gt; Pitri sections. Here, one is suppos=\r\ned to put some black sesame seeds to \n&gt; &gt; the water in the pot. Does this m=\r\nean that one adds the black sesame \n&gt; &gt; seeds to the water already containi=\r\nng the akshatas in the water pot? So, \n&gt; &gt; one gives tarpana to Divya Pitri=\r\ns and Pitris with water containing \n&gt; &gt; akshatas and sesame seeds or water =\r\ncontaining only sesame seeds?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I eagerly await your replies to the =\r\nabove questions.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanks and best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Manish\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &lt;h=\r\nttp://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
