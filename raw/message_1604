It just continues the cycle.\n&gt; &gt; But what is the=\r\n big deal in continuinng the cycle, it would any way\n&gt; &gt; continue which eve=\r\nr path one choses, dharma or adharma.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Without discharging one&#39;s dharm=\r\na, Nature will not allow one to attain moksha. Moksha (liberation) is attai=\r\nned when one is free from desires, attachments, attractions and aversions. =\r\nAs long as there are some karmik debts that need to be settled, Nature will=\r\n keep some attractions and some aversions alive in the person and keep one =\r\naway from liberation. Thus, there is a big difference between following dha=\r\nrma and not following dharma. While following one&#39;s dharma does not guarant=\r\nee liberation, not following one&#39;s dharma does guarantee not getting libera=\r\nted and keeps liberation further away.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The key to making spiritual pr=\r\nogress is to follow one&#39;s dharma, without identifying with the actions too =\r\nmuch. If one fulfils one&#39;s dharma but identifies with the actions strongly =\r\n(i.e. has the sense of &quot;I am doing it&quot; and feels proud), that creates new k=\r\narmas and new bondage. Any action or thought performed with a sense of &quot;I&quot; =\r\ninvolved in it causes new karmas and new bondage. Each such action keeps on=\r\ne further away from liberation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, it is difficult to perform=\r\n actions without a sense of &quot;I am doing it&quot;. So, to start with, atleast rem=\r\nove an action and its doership from your thoughts once the action is finish=\r\ned. Keep the sense of doership while you do it (because it helps you do it =\r\nbetter), but remove it from your mind once the action is complete. Normally=\r\n we cling on to the doership of an action for a long time and that creates =\r\na strong self-identification.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As an example, suppose you build a temp=\r\nle. You may do it with a sense of &quot;*I* am doing some important work&quot; while =\r\nthe building work is going on, because that thought and resultant attachmen=\r\nt motivates you overcome problems. But, once the temple is finished, learn =\r\nto say &quot;krishnaarpanamastu&quot; (surrendered to the Lord) and think no more of =\r\nit as your work or your &quot;achievement&quot;. If people praise you for the great t=\r\nhing you have done, learn to not dwell on it mentally and not feel proud. T=\r\nhere may be no need to demonstrate your humility by lecturing or saying som=\r\nething, but, you can just smile and keep your mind from dwelling on that co=\r\nmpliment and feeling proud.\n&gt;  \n&gt; We cling on to our good and bad actions f=\r\nor too long, by thinking of them (&quot;I did it&quot;) for too long. If we learn to =\r\ncut off doership in the mind once the action is finished, that is a great s=\r\ntarting point. The next step is to not have the sense of &quot;I am doing it&quot; ev=\r\nen as one is doing it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one engages in actions without attachment a=\r\nnd without a sense of ownership/doership, one stops accumulating new karmas=\r\n (new burden). As that happens, one&#39;s conscience becomes stronger and tells=\r\n one of one&#39;s dharma clearer and louder. That enables one to unload the exi=\r\nsting karmik burdens (perform correct dharma) without picking up new burden=\r\ns (no new actions with self-identification). That takes one closer to liber=\r\nation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thus, I emphasize detached action. Being able to engage in act=\r\nion with very little (or no) attachment and sense of doership is more impor=\r\ntant and urgent than finding out what one&#39;s dharma is and discharging it.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; that is what his &quot;gurus&quot; may have asked hi=\r\nm to do\n&gt;  \n&gt; Not every &quot;guru&quot; will have a perfect idea of what one&#39;s dharm=\r\na is. As I said, &quot;If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight in=\r\nto one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance&quot;. After all, one=\r\n&#39;s dharma depends on what actions one engaged in in the past lives while id=\r\nentifying with the actions, what karmik debts were created and what mental =\r\nconditioning was created. Those things can be known with certainty only by =\r\na guru who is self-realized.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; When a terro=\r\nrist is doing a suicide attack he may just be doing his dharma.\n&gt;  \n&gt; That =\r\nis theoretically possible, but very unlikely. One who kills tens or hundred=\r\ns or thousands of people with a sense of &quot;I am doing it&quot;, &quot;I am taking reve=\r\nnge&quot;, &quot;I am punishing them&quot;, &quot;I will go to heaven because of it&quot; is doing a=\r\nn action with a strong self-identification. Whether this act is expected fr=\r\nom one by Nature as a result of previous karmik debts to the victims or not=\r\n is unknowable, but what we can know for sure is that this person has creat=\r\ned new karma and new debts. Any action performed with self-identification c=\r\nauses new karma, new debts and new bondage. The bondage will pull him in a =\r\nfuture life into situations where one will be paid those debts back.\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n*        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; BTW, the article of Robert Svoboda given earlier =\r\ncan also be accessed at the following &quot;tiny&quot; URL (thanks to Kishore for cre=\r\nating it):\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://tinyurl.com/dblc6a\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a=\r\n Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarp=\r\nanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://=\r\nvedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJaga=\r\nnnath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--- \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt;   To: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, April 07, 2009 1:21 AM\n&gt;   S=\r\nubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Nice article on dharma by Robert Svoboda\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n         Namaste\n&gt; \n&gt;         I read Svoboda&#39;s article and I had a few ques=\r\ntion. Theoritcal but relevant.\n&gt; \n&gt;         He has given the idea of of ter=\r\nrorists. When a terrorist is doing a suicide attack he may just be doing hi=\r\ns dharma. That is what he maybe drawn to as per his perceptions, that is wh=\r\nat his &quot;gurus&quot; may have asked him to do, and that is what his ideals/princi=\r\nples/books maybe asked of him to do. So from teh point of view of dharma, h=\r\now can he be blamed? Therefore, the statement taht &quot;Dharmo rakshati rakshit=\r\nah..&quot;, does not make sense. How is his dharma protecting him? What is he ge=\r\ntting in return, other than a bag load of strong karmas to fend off at a la=\r\nter date, when he may not even be aware why he has this karmas.\n&gt; \n&gt;       =\r\n  Can there is conflicting Dharmas for one person? Or more important vs les=\r\ns important dharma? Swadharma should be situational. Sant Tulsidas&#39;s  broad=\r\ner dharma may have been realizing Rama, but as a husband, his dharma should=\r\n have been to keep his wife happy. So ideally, I don&#39;t think we can ever fu=\r\nll perform every dharma that is expected of us. \n&gt; \n&gt;         I believe the=\r\n reason this idea of Dharma was existent in ancient times, was mostly becau=\r\nse nature has created various kinds of people, each with varying tendencies=\r\n. This idea of Dharma was sort of approxiamtion, or the best way to tell me=\r\nn that we are all different and yet we are not incorrect in anyway. This is=\r\n much better than the new ages philosophies which outright deny reality and=\r\n claim everything and everyone is born equal. It is not so.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Th=\r\ne word religion is a 13 century invention and, etymologically, and inherent=\r\nly competitive in nature. Unlike Dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Also, as Narasimhaji&#39;=\r\ns mail shows correctly, following Dharma is no gaurantee of anything, least=\r\n of all Moksha. It just continues the cycle. But what is the big deal in co=\r\nntinuinng the cycle, it would any way continue which ever path one choses, =\r\ndharma or adharma. \n&gt; \n&gt;         A much better way of conduction life, I fe=\r\nel, is maknig a mental note of Karma. To know teh simple truth that that wh=\r\nich goes out will come back to you and that, if you had not been bad at som=\r\ne point, nothing bad will ever come to you. For an otherwise ordinary perso=\r\nn, following a life based on and being on the right side of karma, is much =\r\neasier and profitable  than trying to find that elusive dharma which anyway=\r\n won&#39;t help one in the long run.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Just my feeling on the subjec=\r\nt.\n&gt; \n&gt;         -Regards\n&gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt;         --- On Tue, 7/4/0=\r\n9, Narasimha P.V.R.

The t=\r\nime then was such that there was too much weight \n&gt;           &gt; on earth an=\r\nd nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous \n&gt;         =\r\n  &gt; destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great ext=\r\nent, \n&gt;           &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna be=\r\ning a great warrior, \n&gt;           &gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. S=\r\nome people he deeply loved and \n&gt;           &gt; respected were on the other s=\r\nide and it was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; When t=\r\nhe same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of \n&gt;           &gt; =\r\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a \n&gt;=\r\n           &gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was diff=\r\nerent in this \n&gt;           &gt; new time and place.

When=\r\n he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna \n&gt;           &gt; =\r\nsaid), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt;     =\r\n      &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; *        *        *\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; The=\r\n tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt;           =\r\n&gt; \n&gt;           &gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follo=\r\nw your own dharma \n&gt;           &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the ligh=\r\nt of castism. Though the concept \n&gt;           &gt; of caste (varna) has been t=\r\nhere in Hinduism for a long time, the concept of \n&gt;           &gt; caste mobil=\r\nity was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by \n&gt;           &gt; k=\r\nilling birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a =\r\n\n&gt;           &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and =\r\na maharshi \n&gt;           &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One =\r\nstarts off with the varna \n&gt;           &gt; of father, because that is what on=\r\ne is exposed to in childhood. As one \n&gt;           &gt; develops in life, one g=\r\nets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; Th=\r\nus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your \n=\r\n&gt;           &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just=\r\n 4 dharmas in \n&gt;           &gt; the world. Each person has individual dharma.\n=\r\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very=\r\n difficult. If one is pure \n&gt;           &gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dha=\r\nrma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \n&gt;           &gt; mind that tells u=\r\ns what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of \n&gt;           &gt; noise=\r\n from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get \n&gt;    =\r\n       &gt; confused.\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; We should make the best jud=\r\ngment combining discrimination and intuition and \n&gt;           &gt; decide what=\r\n is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may err, but doing \n&gt;           =\r\n&gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; More =\r\nthan following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in \n&gt;     =\r\n      &gt; actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we are no=\r\nt \n&gt;           &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We =\r\nshould not build \n&gt;           &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. W=\r\ne should engage in the best \n&gt;           &gt; possible actions (based on our b=\r\nest judgment on what our dharma in the given \n&gt;           &gt; situation is), =\r\nwith as little attachment and self-identification with the \n&gt;           &gt; a=\r\nction as possible. When the action is finished, we should leave the result =\r\n\n&gt;           &gt; to god. We should not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen no=\r\nw&quot;, &quot;will it \n&gt;           &gt; work&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yog=\r\na (unfication through \n&gt;           &gt; unattached action) will simplify our e=\r\ngo and purify our consciousness slowly. \n&gt;           &gt; As we become purer, =\r\nour mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. \n&gt;           &gt; Ther=\r\ne is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our \n&gt;    =\r\n       &gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is=\r\n not easy, \n&gt;           &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt;          =\r\n &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dha=\r\nrma, one&#39;s sense of \n&gt;           &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with ti=\r\nme if one engages in action with \n&gt;           &gt; little attachment.\n&gt;       =\r\n    &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; *        *        *\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; In de=\r\nciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. \n&gt;      =\r\n     &gt; Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. O=\r\nne can \n&gt;           &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is giv=\r\nen to one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt;           &gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritu=\r\nal master, one can take the words of \n&gt;           &gt; the master to determine=\r\n one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; When Ar=\r\njuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing gurus \n&gt;   =\r\n        &gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarif=\r\nied his \n&gt;           &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was co=\r\nnfused about his dharma \n&gt;           &gt; and wanted to renounce the world and=\r\n go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \n&gt;           &gt; Ramakrishna Paramaham=\r\nsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material \n&gt;           &gt; worl=\r\nd and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; One who i=\r\ns not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \n&gt;      =\r\n     &gt; debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment o=\r\nf what \n&gt;           &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul wi=\r\nth a clear insight into \n&gt;           &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can gi=\r\nve perfect guidance.\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; *        *        *\n&gt;    =\r\n       &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a =\r\nset of principles and \n&gt;           &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma=\r\n changes from person to person, from \n&gt;           &gt; time to time and from p=\r\nlace to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find \n&gt;           &gt; out wha=\r\nt one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s \n&gt;     =\r\n      &gt; dharma by increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spi=\r\nritual \n&gt;           &gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actio=\r\nns without much \n&gt;           &gt; attachment, one can slowly purify oneself an=\r\nd refine one&#39;s understanding of \n&gt;           &gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt;  =\r\n         &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; Best regards,\n&gt;           &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;          =\r\n &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n\n&gt;           &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ =\r\nhomam\n&gt;           &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org/ tarpana\n&gt;           &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/v=\r\nedic- wisdom\n&gt;           &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. h=\r\nome.comcast. net\n&gt;           &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.=\r\nVedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;           &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http=\r\n://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;           &gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- \n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt; ----- Or=\r\niginal Message ----- \n&gt;           &gt; From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo=\r\n.co. in&gt;\n&gt;           &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt;           &gt; S=\r\nent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n&gt;           &gt; Subject: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Dharma\n&gt;           &gt; \n&gt;           &gt;&gt; Namaste to all\n&gt;           &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  =\r\n         &gt;&gt; i just finished my Aghora series\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; and in it in la=\r\nst part\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma is very personal.\n&gt;   =\r\n        &gt;&gt; Can somebody share views on that and how can we approach\n&gt;      =\r\n     &gt;&gt; towards it\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; Does it has to do something with vedas an=\r\nd upanishads\n&gt;           &gt;&gt;\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; regards\n&gt;           &gt;&gt; jitender\n=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
