Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks to the efforts of Ravi Poruri and Kishore Chitrapu, we now ha=\r\nve Mahagnapathi homam manual and Shiva homam manual available with mantras =\r\nwritten in Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam scripts (in addition to Sanskrit a=\r\nnd English scripts). The instructions and explanations continue to be in En=\r\nglish, but the mantras are written in these languages for ease of reading.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; We have also made available a quick reference guide (or &quot;cheat sheet&quot;=\r\n) containing only mantras and no instructions. If you already read the manu=\r\nal and feel comfortable with the procedure and only want a printout of mant=\r\nras to refer to, you can download it and use it. It is also available for M=\r\nahaganapathi homam and Shiva homam in Telugu, Kannada, Malayalam, Sanskrit =\r\nand English scripts.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Just go to the homam website below and go to Mah=\r\naganapathi homam or Shiva homam link to download these additions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Oth=\r\ner homam manuals will also be available in this format soon. Ravi and Kisho=\r\nre are slowly working on one manual after another.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Baraha software fr=\r\nom baraha.com was used for Indian languages (big thanks to them!). They hav=\r\ne Vedic swaras available only in Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. If you want=\r\n the manual in any other Indian language, please send a nice note requestin=\r\ng the friendly developers of baraha o add support for vedic swaras in that =\r\nlanguage. As they add this support in other languages, we will create more =\r\nhomam manuals.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the long run, I want manuals to be fully translated=\r\n to various Indian languages, i.e. instructions and explanations also in Te=\r\nlugu, Kannada, Malayalam etc. But that may take a long time.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/hom=\r\nam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; S=\r\npirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish less=\r\nons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Wind=\r\nows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: =\r\nhttp://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
