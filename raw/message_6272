Each race =\r\nhas to make its own result, to fulfil its own mission. Political greatness =\r\nor military power is never the mission of our race; it never was, and, mark=\r\n my words, it never will be. But there has been the other mission given to =\r\nus, which is to conserve, to preserve, to accumulate, as it were, into a dy=\r\nnamo, all the spiritual energy of the race, and that concentrated energy is=\r\n to pour forth in a deluge on the world, whenever circumstances are propiti=\r\nous.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
