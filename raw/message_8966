It is of course possible to do the way you mentioned =\r\nbelow also, i.e. 2100 times.\n=C2=A0\n(2) Good observation! I noted the same =\r\nlong back, i.e. the 24 deities found in one AvaraNa in saptashatI yantra (a=\r\nnd among parivAra devatAH) are all found in those &quot;namastasyai namastasyai&quot;=\r\n verses in the 5th chapter in the same order, except that dhR^iti and puShT=\r\ni are missing. I added two verses to Saptashati - one for dhR^iti (after la=\r\nkShmI verse) and one for puShTi (after tuShTi verse). If others want to do =\r\nthe same, the text is in the following format:\n=C2=A0\nyA devI sarva bhUteSh=\r\nu &lt;name&gt; rUpeNa saMsthitA. namastasyai namastasyai namastasyai namonamaH..\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nPlace dhR^iti and puShTi in the place of &lt;name&gt;. Add the two verses =\r\nafter the verses for lakShmI and tuShTi (respectively).\n=C2=A0\nSome people =\r\nmay wonder that this will add 2 to the count of 700. I think the current sa=\r\nptashati counting is anyway messed up and we arrive at 700 in a laborious m=\r\nanner. Moreover, there are different versions. So I am not bothered about t=\r\nhe exact count. It is tough to know for sure what the exact original text w=\r\nas. It may be a combination of several options available today. But definit=\r\nely it should include the above two verses.\n=C2=A0\nI have been reading Sapt=\r\nashati this way for many years now and told a few people I met physically a=\r\nnd chanted with, but perhaps failed to mention it online. I am glad you ask=\r\ned!\n=C2=A0\n(3) I am cc&#39;ing to him. If he wants, he can reply.\n=C2=A0\nBut pl=\r\nease remember that different bodies have different needs. The food and wate=\r\nr schedule that worked for him may not work for you. You need to find somet=\r\nhing that works for you. Basic guidelines would be:\n=C2=A0\n(A) Don&#39;t do hom=\r\nam (or meditation) on a heavy stomach. Either (i) eat very lightly and cont=\r\ninue, or (ii) eat moderately, stop for an hour and continue then, or (iii) =\r\neat heavily and stop for 2-3 hours. Basically, you should not feel heavy wh=\r\nen in homam or japam.\n=C2=A0\n(B) At the same time, starving yourself when y=\r\nou are still aware of body and attached to it, is also unproductive. If you=\r\n do homam for 5-6 hours and feel really hungry and weak, it is not a great =\r\nidea to continue. It will be better to eat a light quantity and continue, p=\r\nerhaps after a small gap.\n=C2=A0\n(C) Apart from how much you eat, what you =\r\neat is important. If you want to do serious sadhana, eat saattwik food. Don=\r\n&#39;t use too much oil, don&#39;t eat meat or eggs, don&#39;t eat heavy or pungent spi=\r\nces, don&#39;t eat fried food, don&#39;t eat tamasik things like onion and garlic e=\r\ntc. Eat simple steamed vegetables with rice, chappati etc and may be a litt=\r\nle ghee or oil. Milk and fruits are also a great idea, though you should no=\r\nt eat most fruits with milk (they are a bad combination that will spoil you=\r\nr digestion). You can drink milk one time and eat some fruits another time,=\r\n etc.\n=C2=A0\n(D) I did homam for entire day a few times. I also did homam f=\r\nor half of the day and japam for the rest of the day. I found the latter to=\r\n be more effective. But others may feel differently.\n=C2=A0\nIf one indeed g=\r\nets a chance to spend most of awake time in homam/japam (or even just chant=\r\ning some prayer) for 3-5 days, that will be awesome. For one who may be rea=\r\ndy, such sadhana can trigger the next stage in one&#39;s ongoing transformation=\r\n. I know someone from here, who started spending 12 hours everyday in a com=\r\nbination of homam, japam and reading prayers, and he indeed started the nex=\r\nt stage in his ongoing transformation within a few days of that sadhana. Of=\r\n course, we are all different and have different strengths, weaknesses, bag=\r\ngages and conditioning..\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology =\r\n& Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n=C2=A0\nOn=\r\n Sat, Jan 19, 2013 at 5:34 AM, dgporob@... wrote:\n=C2=A0\nDear Narasim=\r\nha Ji and other members. \nI have been following this forum for some time no=\r\nw and joined this week so that I can take part and get help with questions =\r\nI have from time to time.=C2=A0 Hope members of the forum would be helpful =\r\nand share their views.
