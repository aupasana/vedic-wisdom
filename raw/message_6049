Shut yourself up in an airy r=\r\noom. Do not talk to anybody. Do not see anybody. Do not hear anything. Get =\r\nup at 4 a.m. Start Japa of the Mantra of your Ishta Devata or your Guru Man=\r\ntra and finish it at sunset. Then take some milk and fruits or Kheer (milk =\r\nand rice boiled with sugar). Take rest for one or two hours but continue th=\r\ne Japa. Then again start Japa seriously. Retire to bed at 11 in the night. =\r\nYou can combine meditation along with Japa. Make all arrangements for bath,=\r\n food, etc, inside the room. Have two rooms if you can manage, one for bath=\r\n and the other for meditation. Repeat this four times in a year. This pract=\r\nice can be kept up even for 40 days. You will have wonderful results and va=\r\nrious experiences. You will enter into Samadhi. You will have Darshan of yo=\r\nur Ishtam. I assure you.\n\n\n"}}
