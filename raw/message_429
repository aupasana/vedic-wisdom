Please take \nthis discussion to vedic-astrology or some such yahoogroup. This yahoogroup \nis strictly discussing spiritual matters.\n\nThere is no benefit for the spiritual progress of anybody here if arguments \nare made with highly opinionated proponents of fringe theories as far as \nastrology and astronomy are concerned. Such people come with deep \nconvictions and have a different idea regarding several basics. Even after a \nlong debate, it is likely that both sides stick to their positions and no \nagreement is reached. I have been through such useless debates many times on \nvedic-astrology yahoogroup and wiser from the experience. Moreover arguments \nwith people who have displayed a militant disposition are particularly \nunproductive.\n\nPlease everybody drop the topic of astrology and its calculations.\n\n*        *        *\n\nMr Avtar Krishen Kaul, you got your opportunity and made your point. Please \nstop harping now and leave this topic. Those who have a rina with you, share \nyour samskaras and are destined to be guided (or misguided) by you have been \nexposed to your view now. That is enough. You cannot expect to get more from \nthis forum. This forum is NOT for discussing astrology and astronomical \ncalculations. Please leave this discussion now.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI taught astrology at Arsha Vidya Gurukulam several times. I met Nandan \nChirmulay, a good astrologer and an engineer, there. He was a fellow \nteacher. He apparently got into astrology to disprove it!\n\nWhen he was doing BTech at IIT, Bombay, he argued with some classmates that \nastrology was nonsense. Dismissing a subject without knowing it well enough \nis unwise. So he took up a study of astrology. He intended to confirm that \nit does not work. But, as he learnt it, he realized that it has some worth \nin it and not nonsense as he believed. He realized that our understanding \nmay not be perfect and we cannot be 100% successful with predictions, but it \nhas worth in it and works with a reasonable success rate. Now he is an \nastrologer and astrology teacher.\n\nSuch people are rare. There are far more people who pronounce judgments on \nsubjects they have not studied in depth.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Avtar Krishen Kaul&quot; &lt;jyotirved@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, September 24, 2008 12:40 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Fwd: Re: &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; - the greatest fraud on \nthe Vedas! (reposted)\n\n\n&gt; --- In hinducivilization@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Avtar Krishen Kaul&quot;\n&gt; &lt;jyotirved@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Shri Bhadraiah Mallampalliji,\n&gt; Namaskar!\n&gt; I would request you to kindly go through your own post once again.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can you pick even a single cogent reason from your own points as to\n&gt; why we should continue to follow the fraud known as Vedic astrology,\n&gt; which is neither scientific, nor logical, least of all Vedic,\n&gt; instead of celebrating our festivals and muhurtas on correct days,\n&gt; as advised by our shastras, logic and science--since\n&gt; Uttarayana/Dakshinayana/Vasanta Sampat/Hemanta Sampat etc. are all\n&gt; phenomena of seasons and therefore scientific!  Similarly, all the\n&gt; Vedas and Puranas have fixed certain days for rituals!  E.g.,\n&gt; Nirjala Ekadashi is a sort of Tapasya only if we observe it in\n&gt; Summer, when we feel most thirsty, whereas in Winter, it is hardly\n&gt; worthwhile!  And that is what we will be doing after a few centuries-\n&gt; -celebrating that day in Winter--thanks to &quot;Vedic astrologers&quot; and\n&gt; their &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; One of your questions is even hilarious!  You have said\n&gt; &lt;When Vedic yajna kanda says if vashat call is given at wrong time\n&gt; some mishap happens, yajamana&#39;s son may die, did it happen really?&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; My counter question is:  If you have no faith in celebrating\n&gt; festivals and muhurtas on correct days, why celebrate them at all,\n&gt; since if no harm has come by celebating them on wrong days,\n&gt; certainly, no harm will come by not celebrating them at all!  Why\n&gt; waste your precious time and energy and money in celebrating them at\n&gt; all?\n&gt;\n&gt; Another counter question is:  Since you are defending &quot;Vedic\n&gt; astrology&quot; with all the might at your command, can you quote any\n&gt; instances where it has done any good to any nation or country?  On\n&gt; the other hand, we have instances galore where it has done the\n&gt; maximum harm:  Our erstwhile Hindu neighbouring country is a glaring\n&gt; example of its &quot;suicide&quot; because of an extraordinary infatuation\n&gt; for &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;.  So is the example of the BJP which had\n&gt; an &quot;akalamrityu&quot; by advanding the last election by several months on\n&gt; the advice of its &quot;Minister of Astrology&quot;!\n&gt;\n&gt; Similar was the case with &quot;the greatest Vedic astrologer of\n&gt; twentieth century&quot;---he overestimated his own life span on the basis\n&gt; of &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; and instead of making preparations for\n&gt; Yamaloka, he planned, on the basis of his &quot;cherished science&quot;, to\n&gt; deliver a lecture on &quot;Astrology as a guide to preventing heart\n&gt; attacks&quot; but he met an &quot;astrologically&quot; unscheduled end and that\n&gt; also because of &quot;cardiac arrest!&quot;!  His jyotisha magazine also has\n&gt; got stopped completely--that &quot;event&quot; also was not foreseen by\n&gt; any  &quot;Vedic astrologer&quot;---since his own offspring fought among\n&gt; themselves like Kilkenny cats over the spoils of the &quot;Vedic jyotisha\n&gt; empire&quot;.  And mind you, all his offspring were &quot;top notch Vedic\n&gt; astrologers&quot; and even &quot;Vastu experts&quot; as per their own claims in\n&gt; that very defunct magazine!\n&gt;\n&gt; Then another &quot;Vedic astrologer&quot; of repute made a fool of himself by\n&gt; declaring that a genetleman of Betul would die at 4-30 pm on a\n&gt; particular date abouit two years back, but unfortunately for\n&gt; that &quot;Vedic astrologer&quot;, that Betul man is still going strong!\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, these are just tips of iceberg and God only knows what\n&gt; damage has been done by dint of &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; to the nation\n&gt; otherwise!\n&gt; Is that the &quot;benevolent&quot; aspect of &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; you are talking\n&gt; about and defending?\n&gt; The most glaring damage it has done is that our budhi has become\n&gt; Tamasik---we have become &quot;budhi brashta&quot; since we have started\n&gt; viewing the adharma of celebrating all our festivals and muhurtas on\n&gt; wrong days as the real dharma and simultaneously calling and\n&gt; defending those predictive gimmikcs that compel us to celebrate our\n&gt; festivals etc. on wrong days as &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;!\n&gt; I do not know what other &quot;beneficial results&quot; you are expecting\n&gt; from &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;!\n&gt; With regards,\n&gt; A K Kaul\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In hinducivilization@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bhadraiah Mallampalli&quot;\n&gt; &lt;vaidix@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Dear Shri Avtar Krishen Kaul,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;Let them quote even a single mantra from any of the Vedas or a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;single shloka from any of the Puranas or any other shastra which\n&gt; has\n&gt;&gt; &gt;advised us to consult some soothsayer before embarking on any\n&gt; plan!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Agreed. Vedic yajnas are done based on &quot;knowledge&quot; of what needs to\n&gt;&gt; be done.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Vedic astrology&quot; wants us to do some &quot;Upay&quot; to gain something\n&gt;&gt; &gt;whether we deserve it or not!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Can you deny yajnas (are done) to get benefits?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&quot;Vedic astrology&quot; is thus a drag on the society since there is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;nothing on record to show that it has done any good to the\n&gt; country:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When Vedic yajna kanda says if vashat call is given at wrong time\n&gt;&gt; some mishap happens, yajamana&#39;s son may die, did it happen really?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; My contention is that the Vedic jyotisha is an imitation (a kind of\n&gt;&gt; poor imitation) of the Vedic practice.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes I agree the top politicians should move away from Jyotish to\n&gt;&gt; Mahabhisheka, Rajasuya, Ashwamedha etc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Also agree about nakshatravda. Satapatha.Br says na-kshatras are\n&gt;&gt; those who had lost their kshatra. Why go after them, when Indra is\n&gt;&gt; the person who grants Mahabhisheka?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards\n&gt;&gt; Bhadraiah\n\n\n"}}
