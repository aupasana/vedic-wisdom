Niyama is very essential, otherw=\r\nise this energy could kill you. in actual fact, that is what Kundalini want=\r\ns to do: &quot;To kill the limited you&quot;,=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;However,=A0the hold of the I ne=\r\nss on everything is so tremendous that its difficult to let go enough that =\r\nyou can allow this Shakti to complete its job.=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The Western educated=\r\n=A0doctors who see these &quot;patients&quot; can&#39;t imagine such a force, because the=\r\ny are conditioned to think in words, most psychiatrists =A0deny the presenc=\r\ne of God completely anyway.\nThis,=A0combined with the fact that for=A0most =\r\npeople, Kundalini is not wanted because these people=A0want the objects whi=\r\nch God can give, not God Herself, means that the scope for misunderstanding=\r\n is tremendous.\n&gt;Everybody wants happiness but most are unable to realise t=\r\nhat &quot;material objects&quot; won&#39;t make you happy.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;That&#39;s life for you. See =\r\nall the saints. You are unlikely to see even one who lived a life of enjoym=\r\nent, in fact they all lived lives of misery(when looked at by an external o=\r\nbserver). However the internal joy of Kundalini is something which fills th=\r\nat saint so completely that some great ones were completely unaware of thei=\r\nr external problems.\n&gt;When Kundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the exte=\r\nrnal world to sleep.I sometimes=A0compare Kundalini rise to a baby being th=\r\nrown in the air by the parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous because=\r\n the baby&#39;s surrender is complete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anything=\r\n without the mother so it&#39;s feeling is that of joy.\n&gt;The problem with adult=\r\ns is that they have to learn surrender. This surrendering of ego to the Div=\r\nine Mother takes time and is not a painless process unlike that of the baby=\r\n.\n&gt;That results in the problem that &quot;real=A0surges&quot; of energy may=A0result=\r\n=A0in mental havoc.=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Secondly, many people who have Kundalini rise a=\r\nre brought up with the concept of japa. Japa which deals with the Air eleme=\r\nnt which is unstable anyway can cause serious instability in these people.\n=\r\n&gt;Some=A0of the=A0people who have Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; may be people who may fe=\r\nel that they haven&#39;t done a single worthwhile thing in their lives and thin=\r\nk that the faking of Kundalini rises may help them get some esteem in the e=\r\nye of the general public.=A0\n&gt;Coming to the specific problem:In general, fo=\r\nr any doctor, the separation of the true from the false claims must precede=\r\n any attempt at helping the patient. A true Kundalini rise needs niyama to =\r\nfinish Vata. Vata tends to like irregularity, in food habits, sleeping habi=\r\nts, sexual matters, travel.=A0\n&gt;To finish Vata, all=A0that must be regiment=\r\nalised, then appropriate herbs used. Control of Apana is essential as is Br=\r\namhacharya. Application of oils to the body to totally calm Vata may be use=\r\nful. I suppose even Shiro basti in difficult real cases may be useful.\n&gt;The=\r\nn institute small=A0Homas to MahaGanapati and the nava grahas to be perform=\r\ned by the patient. That should really improve matters, as Ganesha is The Lo=\r\nrd of the Muladhara.\n&gt;The whole process may be chalked out over one-two yea=\r\nrs.\n&gt;In pure non real cases, just psychotherapy may be sufficient.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Jai=\r\n Shree Rama\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Jai Shree Rama\n&gt;\n&gt;On Friday, March 1, 2013, Narasimha P.=\r\nV.R. Rao  wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;Namaste friends,\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Someone with psychiatric probl=\r\nems may expereience what sounds like a Kundalini rise, but it may or may no=\r\nt be one.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;It must be conceded though that Kundalini spontaneously r=\r\nising through various nadis without one having gone through proper preparat=\r\nion in this life (i.e. fine-tuning of one&#39;s attitude and development of det=\r\nachment) CAN create havoc!\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;One may wonder how Kundalini may spontan=\r\neously rise in a layman with no sadhana, while many serious sadhakas may no=\r\nt experience it.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Firstly, Kundalini rise is NOT an achievement. It =\r\nis just A SMALL\n STEP in overcoming one&#39;s current limited identity.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wanting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated h=\r\nouse (this\n body-mind complex) to a huge palace (realized Self) may first c=\r\nonstruct the palace over time and move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alterna=\r\ntely, if one occasionally goes and stays in the palace still under construc=\r\ntion (analogy for out of body experiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an =\r\nachievement? In fact, it comes with risks. The former approach is safer and=\r\n one loses nothing in it. Similarly, one can progress towards complete Self=\r\n-realization without any out of body experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, =\r\nbut Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words to Lord Rama.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Secondly, one does not=\r\n get something without wanting it and putting sufficient effort towards it.=\r\n One may have deeply desired a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may ha=\r\nve put enough effort. As a result, one may be getting it now. But one may b=\r\ne unprepared (and ironically may not even want it!) when it comes in this l=\r\nife.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;As you do sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific\n desires=\r\n. Nature has a delay mechanism in granting your desires (because of constra=\r\nints on what Nature can give you right now, arising from YOUR\n OWN previous=\r\n actions). So Nature sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no lo=\r\nnger want it or want something else. For example, one may pray for great we=\r\nalth one&#39;s whole life and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life.=\r\n One may not enjoy that wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life =\r\nafter that, one may be very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. I=\r\nn another \ncase, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be =\r\nreborn \nas a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy =\r\nthat \nexperience. Basically, people keep going in circles through various l=\r\nives, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Anyway, coming=\r\n back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experience given b=\r\ny a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one from having it=\r\n in THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific desire desti=\r\nned to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0\n *\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Kundalini rise is not =\r\nnecessarily scary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude =\r\nand detachment.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went=\r\n to free it and it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went=\r\n to save it from a certain slow death and it was scared that I would kill i=\r\nt!\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this b=\r\nody-mind complex and scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;If our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) ar=\r\ne incorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a com=\r\nplete realization of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body-m=\r\nind complex, without being scared?\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Kundalini rise after most undesirable conditionin=\r\ng is overcome, is far better than\n Kundalini rise forced when some really u=\r\nndesirable conditioning is still left in one&#39;s system.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;When one tra=\r\nnscends one problematic notion about who one is and what one needs, another=\r\n notion that lay buried deeper in consciousness may spring to the surface a=\r\nnd torment one. If one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be a=\r\nnother notion in one&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to =\r\n(e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc). =\r\nAs an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to be a great=\r\n soul who rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnated X or Y=\r\n who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Kundalini!)=\r\n deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person may show =\r\nsome signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck badly.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesirable conditioning may a=\r\nccentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and cause serious psyc=\r\nhiatric and spiritual problems.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;The best approach I recommend is to NOT think in ter=\r\nms of Kundalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your\n weaknesses an=\r\nd improve your detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that detach=\r\nment is not disgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Disgust =\r\nis the other side of coin of attachment. It is a negative attachment.\n&gt;&gt;=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;Don&#39;t worry about \nwhether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about w=\r\nhether you are able to resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages=\r\n (ashta pashas) or \nnot. If your ability to resist them is increasing, you =\r\nare making progress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still m=\r\naking progress. When you completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awa=\r\nreness) \nwill automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self)=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;One word =\r\non surrendering to a personal deity. Though true surrender is helpful, most=\r\n people do not have it. They simply do business with god. Though people may=\r\n be offended by my words, this is the plain and bare fact.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;&quot;I want =\r\nX, I will pray to you and please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini =\r\nrise, I will pray to you and please protect me&quot; - all this is just a busine=\r\nss deal. There is something you want and you ask god for it. True surrender=\r\n has no place for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender=\r\n is losing oneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True sur=\r\nrender is accepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurab=\r\nle or highly painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True su=\r\nrrender is thinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face=\r\n of (and during) Death.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;If one without true surrender and with many=\r\n desires and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be t=\r\nrapped, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does not wan=\r\nt to &quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting or endangering=\r\n. If you go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was =\r\ntrying to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning make=\r\ns one *run away* from God&#39;s\n protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a con=\r\nditioned mind like grave danger that one should run away from!\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;*=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Whether through the pat=\r\nh of wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that a=\r\nll this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have=\r\n and keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only=\r\n detachment and a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, disli=\r\nkes etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self. Heavy =\r\nconditioning and impurities in one&#39;s nadis will distract rising Kundalini (=\r\nself-awareness) and stop Her from meeting True Self.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;The real key i=\r\ns how light your conditioning is.\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;&gt;-----=\r\n---\n&gt;&gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n--------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=A0\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;________________________________\n&gt;&gt;&gt; From: Leela=\r\n Sastry &lt;leela.sastry@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, February 28, 2013 6:05 AM\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=A0YES=\r\n=A0 SIR=A0 , perfectly correct=A0=A0 ,=A0but intense bhakthi and saranagath=\r\ni=A0 makes the ishtadevatha to stand by the sadhaka and remove most of the =\r\nhurdles .=A0=A0All the so called dhyanamargas with out any personal deity a=\r\nnd manthra allow the other entities to enter in to the inner planes who pla=\r\ny havoc with the=A0 psyche .=A0 Once we are under the protection of=A0 a ma=\r\nhadevatha ,all the other=A0 disturbances will definitely=A0 be wiped off . =\r\nBut=A0 it can be attained by the righteous behaviour along with manthranush=\r\ntana .

Constant efforts of purification of the vari=\r\nous elements that compose the human mind-body structure. In simpler words t=\r\nhis translates into more detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness=\r\n, control of anger, lust, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalin=\r\ni awakening happens, one has to now self identify with the Devata with grea=\r\nter force. Devotion of a far more intense kind is must. The Devata then tak=\r\nes care of the journey. 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens =\r\n- IF and when it really does - it can also open up the mind and body to var=\r\nious other things and entities, some of which are not postive in nature whi=\r\nle some of them are useless, and given half a chance can make use of the in=\r\ndividual for its own ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in characte=\r\nr and nature and miss-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi become=\r\ns even more\n vital. 4 - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an e=\r\nxperience of Kundalini Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of =\r\npsychology are because of this. The human psychology as understood by west =\r\ntoday is puerile and insufficient to deal with various things. It is also p=\r\nossible sometimes that the aura of an individual, which protects us from va=\r\nrious subtle influences and helps us to remain as functional entities, can =\r\nget &quot;ruptured&quot; due to various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifes=\r\ntyles, trauma etc. That can allow free assess of various entities inside th=\r\ne mind and they have chances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are =\r\nvery complex and various possiblities are there, it is not possible to list=\r\n down every option. Moreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly done, v=\r\nery few can have the right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who cla=\r\nim they can do so, are often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess w=\r\nork.\n Sometimes it will have results, sometimes not. For all these to be ac=\r\nhieved, the starting point is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient =\r\nGreeks used to say - Mens sana in corpore sano. -Regards =A0Rajarshi \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |param bhAwamajAnant=\r\no mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_10=\r\n80@...&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, =\r\n28 February 2013 1:50 PM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syndrome b=\r\nased on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psychiatry =\r\njob at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who seems to =\r\nthink she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since childhoo=\r\nd. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in the bo=\r\ndy. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini until her =\r\nsymptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not been able=\r\n to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so it might=\r\n be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call mentally il=\r\nl describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spontaneous=\r\n kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research into this to=\r\npic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not well-und=\r\nerstood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments for deranged\n kun=\r\ndalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken the kund=\r\nalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundalini sho=\r\nuld not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at times beca=\r\nuse the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it will con=\r\nsume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered what solut=\r\nion there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to the Divin=\r\ne Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of this w=\r\noman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. May I req=\r\nuest that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others like h=\r\ner (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. And let u=\r\ns be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ourselves=\r\n. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps safest =\r\nto say &quot;let me be your instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini\n rising bit to G=\r\nod&#39;s will.

Niyama is very essential, otherwise this energy could kill you. in act=\r\nual fact,\n that is what Kundalini wants to do: &quot;To kill the limited you&quot;,&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;However,&nbsp;the hold of the I ness on everything is so=\r\n tremendous that its difficult to let go enough that you can allow this Sha=\r\nkti to complete its job.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The Western educate=\r\nd&nbsp;doctors who see these &quot;patients&quot; can&#39;t imagine such a force, because=\r\n they are conditioned to think in words, most psychiatrists &nbsp;deny the =\r\npresence of God completely anyway.&lt;/div&gt;\nThis,&nbsp;combined with the fact =\r\nthat for&nbsp;most people, Kundalini is not wanted because these people&nbs=\r\np;want the objects which God can give, not God Herself, means that the scop=\r\ne for misunderstanding is tremendous.&lt;div&gt;Everybody wants happiness but mos=\r\nt are unable to realise that &quot;material objects&quot; won&#39;t make you happy.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;That&#39;s life for you. See all the saints. You are unlikely to s=\r\nee even one who lived a life of enjoyment, in fact they all lived lives of =\r\nmisery(when looked at by an external observer). However the internal joy of=\r\n Kundalini is something which fills that saint so completely that some grea=\r\nt ones were completely unaware of their external problems.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;When =\r\nKundalini (Chit Shakti) awakens it puts the external world to sleep.&lt;/div&gt;I=\r\n sometimes&nbsp;compare Kundalini rise to a baby being thrown in the air by=\r\n the parent. The baby&#39;s look of joy is tremendous because the baby&#39;s surren=\r\nder is complete. The baby knows that it can&#39;t do anything without the mothe=\r\nr so it&#39;s feeling is that of joy.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;The problem with adults is tha=\r\nt they have to learn surrender. This surrendering of ego to the Divine Moth=\r\ner takes time and is not a painless process unlike that of the baby.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;That results in the problem that &quot;real&nbsp;surges&quot; of energy may&nbsp;=\r\nresult&nbsp;in mental havoc.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Secondly, many=\r\n people who have Kundalini rise are brought up with the concept of japa. Ja=\r\npa which deals with the Air element which is unstable anyway can cause seri=\r\nous instability in these people.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Some&nbsp;of the&nbsp;people wh=\r\no have Kundalini &quot;rises&quot; may be people who may feel that they haven&#39;t done =\r\na single worthwhile thing in their lives and think that the faking of Kunda=\r\nlini rises may help them get some esteem in the eye of the general public.&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Coming to the specific problem:&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;In gener=\r\nal, for any doctor, the separation of the true from the false claims must p=\r\nrecede any attempt at helping the patient. A true Kundalini rise needs niya=\r\nma to finish Vata. Vata tends to like irregularity, in food habits, sleepin=\r\ng habits, sexual matters, travel.&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;To finish Vata, all&nbsp=\r\n;that must be regimentalised, then appropriate herbs used. Control of Apana=\r\n is essential as is Bramhacharya. Application of oils to the body to totall=\r\ny calm Vata may be useful. I suppose even Shiro basti in difficult real cas=\r\nes may be useful.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Then institute small&nbsp;Homas to MahaGanapat=\r\ni and the nava grahas to be performed by the patient. That should really im=\r\nprove matters, as Ganesha is The Lord of the Muladhara.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The whole=\r\n process may be chalked out over one-two years.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;In pure non real=\r\n cases, just psychotherapy may be sufficient.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jai =\r\nShree Rama&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Jai Shree Rama&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;On Friday, Ma=\r\nrch 1, 2013, Narasimha P.V.R.

It is just A SMALL\n STEP in overcoming o=\r\nne&#39;s current limited identity.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Let me give an analogy. One wan=\r\nting to move from one&#39;s small dilapidated house (this\n body-mind complex) t=\r\no a huge palace (realized Self) may first construct the palace over time an=\r\nd move into it when it is COMPLETE. Alternately, if one occasionally goes a=\r\nnd stays in the palace still under construction (analogy for out of body ex=\r\nperiences due to Kundalini rise), is it an achievement? In fact, it comes w=\r\nith risks. The former approach is safer and one loses nothing in it. Simila=\r\nrly, one can progress towards complete Self-realization without any out of =\r\nbody experiences. These are not my word&#39;s, but Maharshi Vasishtha&#39;s words t=\r\no Lord Rama.&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Secondly, one does not get something without wan=\r\nting it and putting sufficient effort towards it. One may have deeply desir=\r\ned a Kundalini rise in a previous life and may have put enough effort. As a=\r\n result, one may be getting it now. But one may be unprepared (and ironical=\r\nly may not even want it!) when it comes in this life.&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;As you =\r\ndo sadhana, try not to fancy too many specific\n desires. Nature has a delay=\r\n mechanism in granting your desires (because of constraints on what Nature =\r\ncan give you right now, arising from YOUR\n OWN previous actions). So Nature=\r\n sometimes gives you what you want LATE, when you no longer want it or want=\r\n something else. For example, one may pray for great wealth one&#39;s whole lif=\r\ne and be born as a rich but very sick man in next life. One may not enjoy t=\r\nhat wealth and pray whole life for health. In the life after that, one may =\r\nbe very healthy, but not have any knowledge or money. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;In anoth=\r\ner \ncase, one may deeply desire to act in a famous film. One may be reborn =\r\n\nas a tiger or a dog and act in a famous film, but not really enjoy that \ne=\r\nxperience. Basically, people &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;keep going in circles through var=\r\nious lives, always &quot;seeking&quot; something they are &quot;missing&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Any=\r\nway, coming back to Kundalini, if one deeply desires an out of body experie=\r\nnce given by a rising Kundalini and one&#39;s previous karmas constrain one fro=\r\nm having it in THIS life, one may be born in next life with this specific d=\r\nesire destined to fructify (if there is enough karmik force behind it).&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Kundalini rise is not necessarily s=\r\ncary or painful, if one is well-prepared in terms of attitude and detachmen=\r\nt.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Once I saw a chipmunk glued to a mouse trap. I went to free=\r\n it and it panicked so badly and started to shake violently. I went to save=\r\n it from a certain slow death and it was scared that I would kill it!&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;We are like that chipmunk, glued to the mouse trap called this bod=\r\ny-mind complex and scared of being rescued from a certain slow death!&lt;br&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If our ideas about who we are (viz this current body-mind complex) =\r\nare incorrect and if we are this &quot;infinite Self&quot; as shastras say, won&#39;t a c=\r\nomplete realization of that at some stage involve stepping out of this body=\r\n-mind complex, without being scared?&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Kundalini rise after most undesirable conditioning is overcome, is far =\r\nbetter than\n Kundalini rise forced when some really undesirable conditionin=\r\ng is still left in one&#39;s system.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When one transcends one probl=\r\nematic notion about who one is and what one needs, another notion that lay =\r\nburied deeper in consciousness may spring to the surface and torment one. I=\r\nf one overcomes the notion &quot;I am the body&quot;, there may be another notion in =\r\none&#39;s body-mind complex that one&#39;s awareness clings on to (&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan&gt;e.g. a great doctor, a great leader, a great scholar, a great saint etc&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;). As an extreme example, if one person had a hidden deep desire to b=\r\ne a great soul who rescues the world, he may fancy that he is a re-incarnat=\r\ned X or Y who will rescue the world now. When one&#39;s self-awareness (i.e. Ku=\r\nndalini!) deeply clings to any such notion, it can cause havoc. The person =\r\nmay show some signs of progress and yet remain in ignorance and get stuck\n =\r\nbadly.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;An awakened Kundalini in a system with undesirable cond=\r\nitioning may accentuate one&#39;s weaknesses and wrong notions heavily and caus=\r\ne serious psychiatric and spiritual problems.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The best approach I recommend is to NOT think in terms of Kund=\r\nalini and its rise. Just do sadhana, overcome your\n weaknesses and improve =\r\nyour detachment over time. Again, I want to emphasize that detachment is no=\r\nt disgust or distaste for life/things/people around you. Disgust is the oth=\r\ner side of coin of attachment.&lt;/span&gt; It is a negative attachment.&lt;br&gt;\n&nbs=\r\np;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-style:normal;font-size:13.3333px;background-=\r\ncolor:transparent;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;D&lt;span&gt;on&#39;t wo=\r\nrry about \nwhether your Kundalini rises or not. Worry about whether you are=\r\n able to\n resist 6 internal enemies (shadripus) and 8 bondages (ashta pasha=\r\ns) or \nnot. If your ability to resist them is increasing, you are making pr=\r\nogress. EVEN IF your Kundalini is fast asleep, you are still making progres=\r\ns. When you completely overcome them, Kundalini (your self-awareness) \nwill=\r\n automatically ascend to the top and meet Her Lord (true Self).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-style:normal;font-size:13px;background-color:transparen=\r\nt;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;*&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; *&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One word on surrendering to a personal deity. Though =\r\ntrue surrender is helpful, most people do not have it. They simply do busin=\r\ness with god. Though people may be offended by my words, this is the plain =\r\nand bare fact.&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;I want X, &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;I will pray to y=\r\nou and &lt;/span&gt;please give it to me&quot;, &quot;I am scared of Kundalini rise, I will=\r\n pray to you and please protect\n me&quot; - all this is just a business deal. Th=\r\nere is something you want and you ask god for it. True surrender has no pla=\r\nce for agendas, desires, demands or expectations. True surrender is losing =\r\noneself in one&#39;s fascination for the qualities of Lord. True surrender is a=\r\nccepting anything Lord throws one&#39;s way (whether it is pleasurable or highl=\r\ny painful) as Lord&#39;s prasad and accepting it gratefully. True surrender is =\r\nthinking of Lord with fascination and pleasure, even in the face of (and du=\r\nring) Death.&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If one without true surrender and with many desi=\r\nres and wrong notions experiences a Kundalini rise, one may still be trappe=\r\nd, despite thinking of a personal god. It is not that god does not want to =\r\n&quot;protect&quot; one as said below. It is not about protecting or endangering. If =\r\nyou go back to my &quot;chipmunk glued to mouse trap&quot; example above, I was tryin=\r\ng to protect it, but it was scared. Similarly, one&#39;s conditioning makes one=\r\n *run away* from God&#39;s\n protection! God&#39;s protection may seem to a conditio=\r\nned mind like grave danger that one should run away from!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Whether through the path =\r\nof wisdom or surrender, develop dispassion and detachment. Realize that all=\r\n this is temporary and can be taken away anytime. Enjoy it while you have a=\r\nnd keep doing your best, but be prepared to lose everything anytime. Only d=\r\netachment and a very light mental conditioning (very light desires, dislike=\r\ns etc) can protect one as one&#39;s Kundalini rises to meet True Self.

Constant efforts of purification of the various elements that compo=\r\nse the human mind-body structure. In simpler words this translates into mor=\r\ne detachment, more equanimity, more non-reactiveness, control of anger, lus=\r\nt, greed etc etc. 2 - Once and IF a genuine Kundalini awakening happens, on=\r\ne has to now self identify with the Devata with greater force. Devotion of =\r\na far more intense kind is must. The Devata then takes care of the journey.=\r\n 3 - A good guru is very helpful. As Shakti awakens - IF and when it really=\r\n does - it can also open up the mind and body to various other things and e=\r\nntities, some of which are not postive in nature while some of them are use=\r\nless, and given half a chance can make use\n of the\n individual\n for its own=\r\n ends. They take hold of inhernent weakness in character and nature and mis=\r\ns-utilizes the same. Hence constant Bhuta-suddhi becomes even more vital. 4=\r\n - While someday or other every sadhaka will have an experience of Kundalin=\r\ni Shakti awekening and rising up, not all maladies of psychology are becaus=\r\ne of this. The human psychology as understood by west today is puerile and =\r\ninsufficient to deal with various things. It is also possible sometimes tha=\r\nt the aura of an individual, which protects us from various subtle influenc=\r\nes and helps us to remain as functional entities, can get &quot;ruptured&quot; due to=\r\n various reasons, high stress, or unconventional lifestyles, trauma etc. Th=\r\nat can allow free assess of various entities inside the mind and they have =\r\nchances of causing serious havoc. Since all these are very complex and vari=\r\nous possiblities are there, it is not possible to list down every option. M=\r\noreover, even if such a diagnosis is correctly\n done, very few can have the=\r\n right knowledge to rectify the situation. Many who claim they can do so, a=\r\nre often doing nothing more than an intelligent guess work. Sometimes it wi=\r\nll have results, sometimes not. For all these to be achieved, the starting =\r\npoint is a sound mind in a sound body, as the ancient Greeks used to say - =\r\n&lt;span&gt;Mens sana in corpore sano.&lt;/span&gt; -Regards &nbsp;Rajarshi \n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:16px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;COLOR:rgb(153,153,153);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:=\r\ntimes new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE m=\r\nAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;COLOR:navy;FONT-=\r\nSIZE:10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;pa=\r\nram bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/=\r\nb&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:Courier Ne=\r\nw, courier, monaco, monospace, sans-serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;F=\r\nONT-FAMILY:times new roman, new york, times, serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt;&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div d=\r\nir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;BORDER-BOTTOM:#ccc 1px solid=\r\n;BORDER-LEFT:#ccc 1px solid;min-height:0px;FONT-SIZE:0px;BORDER-TOP:#ccc 1p=\r\nx solid;BORDER-RIGHT:#ccc 1px solid;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:b=\r\nold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; sunrise_1080 &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;sunri=\r\nse_1080@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Thursday, 28 Februa=\r\nry 2013 1:50 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Kundalini syndrome&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Dear all, Just wanted to warn people of kundalini syn=\r\ndrome based on my recent experience of a patient of mine. I am doing a psyc=\r\nhiatry job at present, and have been involved in the care of someone who se=\r\nems to think she has had a spontaneous awakening of their kundalini since c=\r\nhildhood. This has involved out-of-body experiences and surges of energy in=\r\n the body. She is not of Indian origin and had never heard of kundalini unt=\r\nil her symptoms started and she searched for an explanation. We have not be=\r\nen able to find anything physically wrong with her (all tests normal)- so i=\r\nt might be that this is due to deranged kundalini. Many people we call ment=\r\nally ill describe themselves as having a spiritual crisis, or unwanted spon=\r\ntaneous kundalini awakening- this has triggered interest and research into =\r\nthis topic in mainstream psychiatry. Unfortunately these patients are not w=\r\nell-understood by western medicine, and as we have no treatments\n for deran=\r\nged kundalini, we struggle to help them. Many yogis try to forcibly waken t=\r\nhe kundalini. My experience with this lady confirmed my feeling that kundal=\r\nini should not be forcibly wakened. This woman wants to kill herself at tim=\r\nes because the suffering from the deranged energy is so bad. She feels it w=\r\nill consume her, and it is something she cannot escape from. I wondered wha=\r\nt solution there could be to her problem. The logical one was to pray to th=\r\ne Divine Mother, who manifests as the kundalini to relieve the suffering of=\r\n this woman- and either cure her, or give her the strength to bear this. Ma=\r\ny I request that the good samaritans among you pray for her, and for others=\r\n like her (whom we may not know of)- their suffering really is pitiable. An=\r\nd let us be careful in our sadhana so as not to end up in this situation ou=\r\nrselves. Perhaps this is why the bhakti marga is the safest. It is perhaps =\r\nsafest to say &quot;let me be your\n instrument&quot; and leave the kundalini rising b=\r\nit to God&#39;s will. Om Dum Durgayai Namaha Aparna &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \n\n  =\r\n  &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height:0;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n  =\r\n      \n  \n  \n    &lt;table style=3D&quot;margin-top:20px;margin-bottom:10px;&quot; cells=\r\npacing=3D&quot;4px&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;tbody&gt;\n        &lt;tr&gt;\n          &lt;td style=3D&quot;font-size=\r\n:12px;font-family:arial;font-weight:bold;padding:7px 5px 5px;color:#fff;bac=\r\nkground-color:#f2f2f2;border:1px solid #eaeaea;&quot;&gt;\n                         =\r\n &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; style=3D&quot;text-decoration:none;color:#2d50fd;&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/post;_ylc=3D=\r\nX3oDMTJxa2NibnA0BF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzE5MDI5MDE1BGdycHNwSWQDMTcwNTA3NTk=\r\n5MQRtc2dJZAM5MDQ2BHNlYwNmdHIEc2xrA3JwbHkEc3RpbWUDMTM2MjA0OTUwNQ--?act=3Drep=\r\nly&amp;messageNum=3D9046&quot;&gt;Reply via web post&lt;/a&gt;\n                      &lt;/td=\r\n&gt;\n          &lt;td style=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5=\r\npx;color:#fff;background-color:#f2f2f2;border:1px solid #eaeaea;&quot;&gt;\n        =\r\n    &lt;a href=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; style=3D&quot;text-decoration:none;color:#2d50=\r\nfd;&quot;&gt;\n              Reply to sender            &lt;/a&gt; \n          &lt;/td&gt;\n      =\r\n    &lt;td style=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;color=\r\n:#fff;background-color:#f2f2f2;border:1px solid #eaeaea;&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; style=3D&quot;text-decoration:none;color:#2d50fd;&quot;&gt;\n  =\r\n            Reply to group            &lt;/a&gt; \n          &lt;/td&gt;\n          &lt;td s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;color:#fff;bac=\r\nkground-color:#f2f2f2;border:1px solid #eaeaea;&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nof=\r\nollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n/post;_ylc=3DX3oDMTJmZmR1MHA3BF9TAzk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzE5MDI5MDE1BGdycHNwSW=\r\nQDMTcwNTA3NTk5MQRzZWMDZnRyBHNsawNudHBjBHN0aW1lAzEzNjIwNDk1MDU-&quot; style=3D&quot;te=\r\nxt-decoration:none;color:#2d50fd;&quot;&gt;Start a New Topic&lt;/a&gt;\n          &lt;/td&gt;\n  =\r\n        &lt;td style=3D&quot;font-size:12px;font-family:arial;padding:7px 5px 5px;c=\r\nolor:#2d50fd;background-color:#f2f2f2;border:1px solid #eaeaea;&quot;&gt;\n         =\r\n                   &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/9042;_ylc=3DX3oDMTM1amVxdGJ0BF9TAz=\r\nk3MzU5NzE0BGdycElkAzE5MDI5MDE1BGdycHNwSWQDMTcwNTA3NTk5MQRtc2dJZAM5MDQ2BHNlY=\r\nwNmdHIEc2xrA3Z0cGMEc3RpbWUDMTM2MjA0OTUwNQR0cGNJZAM5MDQy&quot; style=3D&quot;text-deco=\r\nration:none;color:#2d50fd;&quot;&gt;Messages in this topic&lt;/a&gt;\n                (5)\n=\r\n                      &lt;/td&gt;\n        &lt;/tr&gt;\n      &lt;/tbody&gt;\n    &lt;/table&gt;\n\n    =\r\n    \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;background-color:#f2f2f2;font-family:Verdana;font-s=\r\nize:10px;margin-bottom:10px;padding:10px;&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt:bold;color:#333;text-transform:uppercase;&quot;&gt;Recent Activity:&lt;/span&gt;\n\n    &lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;=\r\n/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---770455430-778897463-1362167661=:51386--\r\n\n"}}
