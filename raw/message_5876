I was thinking that I=\r\n am having some &#39;Hocus-Pocus illusions&#39; :)\n\nI have one more doubt. In my re=\r\ngular sadhna practice, Sometimes I am doing very good and concentration,exp=\r\nerience is very good. But sometimes concentration is very poor, I dont even=\r\n want to meditate. Even slight meditation feels like headache because of po=\r\nor concentration. \n\nIt is basically like hiting peak and bottom turn by tur=\r\nn. After I hit bottom I start to improve and after i touch peak I fall down=\r\n suddenly. \n\nI understand that this is due to my own incompetency in sadhna=\r\n. Most probably I commit some mistake when at peak and then I loose my bala=\r\nnce. But I make mistakes even when I am going up, but then I do not loose b=\r\nalance and instead i rectify my mistakes very well. When I am having my bes=\r\nt experience, a small mistake make me loose my balance.\n\nI dont know why th=\r\nis happens. Does this happen to everyone or I am lacking ability to do sadh=\r\nna? This disappoints me a lot. During some days I even do not do my regular=\r\n practice and I feel that I am not worthy of doing sadhna. I feel guilty of=\r\n forgetting Krishna. Suddenly lot and lot of non-sense questions and stupid=\r\n ideas arise in mind and I am totally confused. During those days, I dont e=\r\nven remember Krishna. I dont even want to hymn my favourite mantra. I do no=\r\nt bother about pleasant experience. I know these are not my aim. But I feel=\r\n disappointed for forgetting Krishna. During these days every day feels lik=\r\ne I have forgotten him since decades. This disappoints me even more.\n\nDoes =\r\nthis happen to everyone? Any suggestion will be helpful.\n\nI understand that=\r\n we should not share our spiritual experience with everyone. But today I wa=\r\ns not able to stop myself. I do not know that whether I should have written=\r\n these lines here or not.\n\nPlease ignore this mail if it is not worthy of a=\r\nnswering. I usually write useless words.\n\nSorry for mistakes\n\nKind Regards\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Doctor Saa&#39;b,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;In start of spirituality we find tha=\r\nt books are our best guide.

My interest in reading books is almost negligible since past 3 years. On=\r\nly books I read with great interest recently are Aghora Series.\n&gt; \n&gt; I thin=\r\nk Practical is required now. Purpose of books is probably served. As Ramakr=\r\nishna said to one of his disciples that once you read and understood the me=\r\nssage written on a piece of paper, then there is no need to cling on to the=\r\n paper!\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \t\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;Dr. A.

As we move further, percentage of faith inc=\r\nrease overtime and that of logic decrease. At one time, you have to leave a=\r\nll the logic. At a stage, During his lessons to M Shri Ramakrishna Paramaha=\r\nnsa told him to leave all reasoning.

But after some t=\r\nime a stage comes when we feel that books are infact &#39;over-guiding&#39; us. The=\r\ny are trying to give words to our emotions and trying to limitize our feeli=\r\nngs. I think it is right time to quit reading. I am also feeling so about m=\r\nyself. But dont know if I am thinking right.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sometime back someone=\r\n said to me &quot;I was reading Geeta when Shri Krishna said to Arjuna &#39;Oh Arjun=\r\na, stop reading all the books...&#39;.

Until, of course he &gt;&gt;is initiated into religion.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pure rational intelligence will be thoroughly logical and wo=\r\nuld want evidences (which can be perceived by physical senses) for anything=\r\n and everything. Same goes for existence of God/Nature/Self/etc...so the by=\r\n product is lack of belief in the core essence and purpose of religion i.e.=\r\n Spirit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He/she will naturally lack faith (Shradhdhaa). Whenever, in =\r\nlife, due to bitter experiences and/or past Samskaaraas, Logic takes backse=\r\nat and Faith is born, the person is initiated in to religion. It is actuall=\r\ny Initiation in to internal religion which may or may not reflect externall=\r\ny. However, it is my opinion that, it is better to depend upon Logical mind=\r\n while inquiring for truth until faith is born  established and even after =\r\nthat in the journey.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think, Dr. Atual&#39;s view point matches the abov=\r\ne. And you already know all these!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Personally, I am tired of l=\r\nogic as my profession is the area of PLCs (i.e. Programmable *Logic* Contro=\r\nllers :) and writing Process *logic* for long.
