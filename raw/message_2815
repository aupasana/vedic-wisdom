Whenever i see writings from Narasi=\r\nmha or from others which talks about spiritual vibrations, i wonder! If it&#39;=\r\ns a feel good factor within or without?\n\nIf we go to the famous temples of =\r\nIndia today, it is almost sure that one will find lot of crowd and resultan=\r\nt noise, gossips, business, cheating, discrimination etc... etc...\ncan that=\r\n be criteria for judging the spiritual energy of the place?\n\nmy two distinc=\r\nt experiences (external):\n1) i went to Jagannath Puri in year year 95. when=\r\n i entered to take Darshan of all the 3 famous idols, i was shocked by the =\r\ndogmatic behavior of the Pandas standing there near the Idols. they almost =\r\ncommanded me to put some money in front of the Idol. one can imagine my con=\r\ndition. Instead of focusing on the lord, i was angry at them and refused to=\r\n oblige.\n\n2) Once we (group of friends) went to &#39;Mota Ambaji&#39; (in Gujarat n=\r\near Mount Abu). one shopkeeper (who sales pujan saamagri) just at the entra=\r\nnce of the famous temple, gave us all the puja material in a plate. We made=\r\n a mistake by not asking him price. After we came back from the temple, he =\r\nasked us to pay around 1500 Rs per plate. can anybody imagine such price?. =\r\nwe have to bargain so much with him that after that i hardly buy such puja =\r\nsaamgri whenever i go to any temple. for instance if i go to MahaLakshmi Te=\r\nmple of Mumbai, i&#39;ll take 3 lotuses to offer Mahakaali-Mahalakshmi-MahaSara=\r\nswati and that is all.\n\nHowever I must say that the above two bad experienc=\r\nes did not discourage me.\n\nSuch things as well as few other things like Gen=\r\neral atmosphere, crowd, noise, beggars, dirt, etc=85 are external things IM=\r\nHO. There is also spiritual energy generated by many many pure hearted visi=\r\ntors.\n\nWarm regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Astro =\r\nSeeker &lt;astro.seeker@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narsimhaji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for sh=\r\naring your thoughts. They have helped me a lot on the query. Actually, I re=\r\ncently visited few (not to name any but also including 1 or 2 from your lis=\r\nt) places with my parents. But, my experience was really bad. I could see l=\r\not of commercialism and greed invloved amongst everyone there including tho=\r\nse in position over there. And spiritualism was difficult to find. I could =\r\nfeel spiritual vibes more outside (slightly away from the main building and=\r\n crows) the temples than inside. And to my believe, these places would not =\r\nhave been like this always. So, I kept wondering, that if these famous and =\r\nenergised idols have the power to raise the spiritual energies, then why di=\r\nd &quot;locals&quot; who have always been here, are getting corrupted. But, then prob=\r\nably the tamas energies of people coming day in and out have overpowered or=\r\n as you say visitors have made the incense disappear over the period of tim=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have one experience to share, which is somewhat on similar lines.=\r\n I was in Hardiwar with my parents on a certain &quot;Amavasya&quot;. After taking ba=\r\nth, they started looking for a cow to feed as per the custom. Fortunately o=\r\nr unfortunately, we could found a few (around 10) sitting at a certain plac=\r\ne. But, they were surrounded by some 1000 odd people trying to feed them. A=\r\nnd per my estimate a 10000 people would have already fed them per their &quot;Cu=\r\nstom&quot;. Now, does it really make sense to forcibly feed a cow who already ha=\r\nd her quota of 3-4 days, probably leading her to have digestion or food poi=\r\nsoning problems. I tried to convince my parents not to try to feed the, but=\r\n could not succeed. And the whole day felt bad about it.\n&gt; \n&gt; In general, w=\r\nhatever holy place I have visited, I have hardly found it spiritual enough =\r\nand have mostly felt disappointed. Rather, I always happen to see plentiful=\r\n cases of useless greed which make me feel that to keep whatever goodness i=\r\ns left in one, he or she should never visit these places. As they are highl=\r\ny filled with Tamas now.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; Sriram\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 8/10/=\r\n09, Narasimha P.V.R.

However, eventually the smell will be gone! How long it takes \n&gt; =\r\nto disappear depends on how strong the smell was when the stick was \n&gt; burn=\r\nt.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Similarly, when a great saint meditates in a place, \n&gt; the ai=\r\nr there will be filled with that saint&#39;s spiritual energy. Even after the \n=\r\n&gt; saint leaves that place or leaves earth altogether, that energy will ling=\r\ner \n&gt; there. Slowly it becomes weak and disappears.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; In many famo=\r\nus temples these days, priests have \n&gt; become commercial and do not have th=\r\ne devotion needed. The rituals performed \n&gt; every few years to re-energize =\r\nthe idols \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n&gt; *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; It is my humble opinio=\r\nn that some famous temples do \n&gt; not have much divine presence today, thoug=\r\nh I do not want to name any names. At \n&gt; the same time, some not-so-well- k=\r\nnown temples seem to have a powerful divine \n&gt; presence.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I was v=\r\nery impressed with the=C2=A0Krishna temple \n&gt; in Mayapur (ISKCON head offic=\r\ne is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and \n&gt; Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannam=\r\nalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a \n&gt; tremendous amount of spiritua=\r\nl energy in those places. There are several temples \n&gt; where the idol is pr=\r\nactically alive. For example, even 123 years after \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramaham=\r\nsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did \n&gt; not get the s=\r\name impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in \n&gt; Calcutta.\n=\r\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was \n&gt; taken to =\r\nby a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu \n&gt; be=\r\nfore we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of tha=\r\nt \n&gt; temple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the=C2=A0=\r\nform of \n&gt; the divine Mother=C2=A0present there was a Tamil language name a=\r\nnd I did not \n&gt; understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, wh=\r\nen I closed my eyes \n&gt; and started meditating with my mantra in front of th=\r\ne idol, I was dazzled by a \n&gt; vision of a very fierce goddess whose face wa=\r\ns emiting rays like Sun. I felt \n&gt; that there was a powerful presence there=\r\n. Unfortunately, I do not remember the \n&gt; name of the place or the goddess,=\r\n but it is a temple without roof over the \n&gt; goddess. They tried to put a r=\r\noof over the goddess a few times, but the roof \n&gt; came down in a fire accid=\r\nent each time and they finally decided that the goddess \n&gt; likes open air a=\r\nnd no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left in a hurry, I \n&gt; was very p=\r\nleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the \n&gt; name=\r\n of the temple and goddess.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Like this, I am sure there are many =\r\ntemples with a \n&gt; powerful divine presence across India.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Apart f=\r\nrom the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one \n&gt; of my best experiences when m=\r\neditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at \n&gt; Aalandi near Pune. I am s=\r\nure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the \n&gt; underground chamb=\r\ner there.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 \n&gt; *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Even the middle of a busy=\r\n road in India is better \n&gt; for meditating than a temple in USA. These west=\r\nern countries are so filled with \n&gt; rajas and tamas. There is rajas in Indi=\r\na too, but there is a good amount of \n&gt; sattwa there. Thus, any temple in I=\r\nndia will be a good place to meditate, but my \n&gt; view is that there is not =\r\nmuch left at *some* temples. But some temples are \n&gt; really good.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; If one has a chance to spend a few months doing \n&gt; spiritual sadhana near=\r\n a temple, I suggest the following:\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri=\r\n and Kamakhya in east \n&gt; India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hill=\r\ns)=C2=A0and \n&gt; Narayana=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati)=C2=A0in south India, Shi=\r\nrdi, Aalandi, \n&gt; Dwaraka=C2=A0and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India=\r\n, Varanasi, Vrindavan \n&gt; and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Ma=\r\nntralayam=C2=A0and Ujjain in \n&gt; central India.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; There are many ot=\r\nher good places, but the above \n&gt; come to my mind. Visiting a temple once i=\r\ns one thing and staying there for \n&gt; several months while maintaining a sim=\r\nple lifestyle and doing a spiritual \n&gt; sadhana (like homam or japam) there =\r\nis quite another.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best \n&gt; regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; Do \n&gt; a Short H=\r\nomam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do \n&gt; Pitri Tarpana=\r\ns Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: \n&gt; htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free \n&gt; Jyotish lessons (MP3):=\r\n http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free \n&gt; Jyotish software (Windows):=\r\n http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish \n&gt; writings: http://groups. yaho=\r\no.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; Sri \n&gt; Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http=\r\n://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   Fr=\r\nom: \n&gt;   Astro \n&gt;   Seeker \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt;   \n&gt; =\r\n  Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 \n&gt;   AM\n&gt;   Subject: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Holy Places\n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt;     \n&gt;     \n&gt;       Respected Narsimhaji,\n&gt;   =\r\n      \n&gt; \n&gt;         I would like to know your opinion on holy places (famou=\r\ns temples \n&gt;         etc) in today&#39;s time.
