I was writing in a flow and never checked=\r\n\n&gt; what I wrote. Kindly pardon such errors and read through them. As they s=\r\nay,\n&gt; &quot;Bhavnayoko samjho!&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; During the day time, we roamed around s=\r\nhooting at different places. In this\n&gt; 3 days we never visited any of the t=\r\nemples in Kasi. I asked him, &quot;What about\n&gt; the temples? Won&#39;t we visit them=\r\n?&quot;. Manish retorted immediately, &quot; Aren&#39;t\n&gt; we going to the most powerful t=\r\nemple in Kasi every night?&quot;! I silently\n&gt; agreed. This is something about M=\r\nanish I have observed. He rarely enters\n&gt; temples or standard places of wor=\r\nship, but suddenly he might see a small\n&gt; roadside temple and stand and sta=\r\nre for sometimes, even do a pranam and then\n&gt; remark, &quot;There is something h=\r\nere.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; During evening we went to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Bab=\r\na was a\n&gt; Aghori who lived in Kasi during the 16th century. The place is ca=\r\nlled\n&gt; Aghor-sthal. Before entering Manish bought some bel leaves. As we wa=\r\nlked\n&gt; inside the Ashram, Manish became silent, then said there are strong =\r\nenergies\n&gt; in here. Inside we meditated for sometime, Manish did  pranam at=\r\n the samadhi\n&gt; of Baba Bhagwan Ram who was the 11th head of the Ashram. Bab=\r\na Bhagwan Ram\n&gt; had entered Nirvikalpa Samadhi while meditating for 3 conti=\r\nnuous days at the\n&gt; Manikarnika Samshan.  Manish, on being questioned, said=\r\n that many sadhanas\n&gt; have been done here in this place for long by people =\r\nwith no mundane\n&gt; desires. Therefore, the energies are strong here. While l=\r\nooking around the\n&gt; Ashram we found some quotations which were written in s=\r\nmall wooden boards.\n&gt; Manish called Arunisha and me and pointed to one quot=\r\nation. Translated to\n&gt; English, it read, &quot;If you have to give your head off=\r\n to get a sadguru, you\n&gt; have got it cheap&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; By 8 PM we sat for dinner.=\r\n We used to have early dinners, so that we had\n&gt; sufficient time before goi=\r\nng to the samshan. Ideally you should have an\n&gt; empty stomach while perform=\r\ning any sadhana to get the best effects. The\n&gt; amount of fire in the body i=\r\ns fixed. There is one that digests food -\n&gt; Jathara Agni. One that digests =\r\nideas/concepts/experiences - Bhuta Agni\n&gt; (existential fire) which exists i=\r\nn the subtle body. It is the second which\n&gt; must increase in order for one =\r\nto &quot;digest&quot; various experiences/ideas/etc. It\n&gt; can only increase when the =\r\nJathara Agni is less, i.e. you do not have a full\n&gt; stomach. When we are ex=\r\ntremely focused on something and working intently on\n&gt; the same, we forget =\r\nfood, we do not feel hungry. This is due to the increase\n&gt; in Bhuta Agni an=\r\nd decrease in Jathara Agni.\n&gt;\n&gt; As we sat eating our food and talking on di=\r\nfferent topics, we discussed\n&gt; history.The conversation mentioned here is a=\r\n thread picked up from an\n&gt; earlier conversation that we (Manish, Arunisha =\r\nand me) had before coming to\n&gt; Kasi.\n&gt;\n&gt; Manish said, &quot;It is the same set o=\r\nf souls who come back again and again in\n&gt; different bodies and personaliti=\r\nes at different times, who are responsible\n&gt; for this land. There was Chadr=\r\nagupta and Chanakya, there was Prithviraj,\n&gt; there was Akbar, Shankarachary=\r\na, Ramakrishna etc.&quot; He continued, &quot;They can\n&gt; come as kings, yogis, or any=\r\n other form which is necessary for them to\n&gt; accomplish their dharma. And t=\r\nheir dharma is connected to this land which we\n&gt; call India today.This land=\r\n is connected to the Rishis. This is Rishi bhoomi.\n&gt; And Rishis sent people=\r\n when needed. Prithviraj made one mistake, of\n&gt; pardoning Ghori. Imagine wh=\r\nat happened to that woman who made Prithiviraj\n&gt; disobey his Guru?&quot;.I silen=\r\ntly contemplated her fate.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;One very senior Rishi has decided to change=\r\n this land back to a Rishi\n&gt; bhoomi. And so shall it happen. Ved Dharma wil=\r\nl be re established here along\n&gt; the length and breadth. Nothing, however p=\r\nowerful or mightly, be it an\n&gt; individual or group, can stand against the w=\r\nill of a Rishi.&quot;  Arunisha asked\n&gt; a pertinent question here. &quot;What were th=\r\ne Rishis doing for one thousand\n&gt; years?&quot;. Manish laughed and said, &quot; A Ris=\r\nhi can very well spend a thousand\n&gt; years simply in samadhi, meditating. Th=\r\nen suddenly one day wake up from\n&gt; meditation and see that Rishi bhoomi is =\r\ngone and all sorts of non-spiritual\n&gt; things going on here. So He decides, =\r\nit is time to get back and re create\n&gt; the Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no c=\r\nlue about what a Rishi can do. One Rishi\n&gt; is enough to change a universe, =\r\nchanging a country is child&#39;s play for Him.&quot;\n&gt; Wow. I let all these sink in=\r\nside me slowly. Therefore it is so important to\n&gt; keep doing sadhana, in so=\r\nme manner or the other.\n&gt;\n&gt; As night approached midnight, Manish and I left=\r\n for the Manikarnika again.\n&gt; This was going be our last night of Chandi ho=\r\nma at Manikarnika, for now. We\n&gt; walked long the deserted ghats, sliently. =\r\nI asked him if it is ok doing\n&gt; a homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said=\r\n yes why not, but without Shakti,\n&gt; there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the=\r\n divine feminie is the most practical\n&gt; strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the s=\r\ntate of highest consciousness, and to\n&gt; reach that stage one must develop h=\r\nis body and mind such that it can hold\n&gt; shakti for which worshipping the d=\r\nivine Mother is the best way. That is why\n&gt; Vimalananda says, &quot;Let the Moth=\r\ner show you the face of the Father&quot;. The\n&gt; topic drifted to Vimalananda. Ma=\r\nnish said, &quot;Kala Bhairava is very strong in\n&gt; Manikarnika, where as Mahakal=\r\na exists powerfully in the cremation grouds at\n&gt; Ujjain. But Vimalananda di=\r\nd Mahakala sadhana here in Manikarnika.&quot; Then\n&gt; staring at the pitch black =\r\nganges, Manish chuckled lightly and added, &quot;That\n&gt; man was something.&quot; This=\r\n was again an old conversation we had started before\n&gt; which Mainsh continu=\r\ned, &quot;All these babas of today would wet their pants if\n&gt; Vimalananda were t=\r\no stand infornt of them. Those three books have the power\n&gt; of a deity flow=\r\ning through them. Without being physically present,\n&gt; Vimalananda has creat=\r\ned a army of sadhakas!&quot;. I interjected, &quot;The books are\n&gt; like a Bible for s=\r\nadhakas, arn&#39;t they?&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot; said Manish. Later on I asked\n&gt; him if it was =\r\npossible for someone to meet Vimalanada, to which Manish\n&gt; replied that yes=\r\n it was, if one does serious sadhana. However, the important\n&gt; question is =\r\nwhether one will be able to recognize him. I fell silent hearing\n&gt; this. In=\r\nterestingly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora series, Vimalanda does\n&gt; mention=\r\n that a time will come when his &quot;children&quot; would spread homas.\n&gt; Strange, o=\r\nr maybe not so. Who knows how deep things run.\n&gt;\n&gt; We reached the samshan b=\r\ny half past twelve. This time we sat at the same\n&gt; place where we had sat o=\r\nn the first day of homa. The fire was low. Most of\n&gt; the body had been burn=\r\nt already. Manish started the homa. As usual, all the\n&gt; dogs came and sat p=\r\neacefully around the fire. Now this did not surprise me\n&gt; any more. In the =\r\nmiddle of the homa Manish would slowly lift his palm\n&gt; upwards and with the=\r\n next ahuti immediately the fire would leap higher. He\n&gt; did this quite a f=\r\new times, when the flames were getting weaker. I\n&gt; countinued with the Chan=\r\ndi path and passing on the samagri to him as and\n&gt; when he required anythin=\r\ng. One dom who was working on a pyre nearby, came\n&gt; towards us and exclaime=\r\nd,&quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. Manish too responded back, &quot;Jai\n&gt; Mahadev&quot;. This homa was =\r\nfaster. He did not use any &quot;samputs&quot;, but a direct,\n&gt; straight Chandi homa.=\r\n Again in the middle I got up and stroked the pyre a\n&gt; bit, pushing around =\r\nsome of the coconut pieces to make them burn properly. I\n&gt; was enjoying it.=\r\n A few people came and sat near us, listening to the path.\n&gt; In Kasi there =\r\nis a rule that whatever comes in the Samshan is the property\n&gt; of the Dom R=\r\naja (the head of doms). No one has any further claim on it. In\n&gt; old times,=\r\n one Dom Raja was called Kallu Dom. He was an Aghori and a\n&gt; contemporary o=\r\nf Kinnaram Baba. It is said he could raise the dead back to\n&gt; life. Maybe i=\r\nt is because of this tradition that Manikarnika is such an apt\n&gt; place for =\r\nthese sadhanas. I was at one point mentally wondering why are\n&gt; there so ma=\r\nny people in the samshan. The Manish said, if a Nath came here in\n&gt; his gar=\r\nb, everyone will run away from the samshan scared. But there is a\n&gt; reason =\r\nwhy there are people here even so late in the night.\n&gt;\n&gt; Once the final pur=\r\nnahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Though this homa\n&gt; got over faster=\r\n than previous days, the meditation that happened, for me,\n&gt; was superb. At=\r\n one point I felt as if my mind would just burst forth and\n&gt; expand across =\r\nthe length and breadth of the Ganges. My focus was good, but I\n&gt; had to ope=\r\nn my eyes after every 20 minutes or so. Manish continued\n&gt; meditating for n=\r\nearly an hour. Not the slightest movement from him. Nothing.\n&gt; Still like a=\r\n stone. Then a cow came and slightly nudged Manish on his feet.\n&gt; That made=\r\n him open his eyes. Manish remarked, &quot; I could have just left my\n&gt; body and=\r\n gone off. It did not matter that I had a flight to catch the next\n&gt; day, o=\r\nr anything else. I was on the verge of death. Just at that moment the\n&gt; cow=\r\n and brought me back.&quot; Smiling he added, &quot;What a sight it would have been\n&gt;=\r\n for the people to see, how the body can be left at will&quot;.  I did not know\n=\r\n&gt; what to say.\n&gt;\n&gt; We stood there watching another pyre in front. The body =\r\nwas half burnt. The\n&gt; torso had become black with deep red patches all over=\r\n. The dom came forward,\n&gt; and with the bamboo stick inserted it (the bamboo=\r\n stick) from the side of\n&gt; the corpse, lifting up the burning torso into th=\r\ne air and placing it again,\n&gt; strategically, in the middle of the pyre. The=\r\n smooth motion of lifting up\n&gt; the half burnt torso, sticking out from one =\r\nend of the bamboo stick, into\n&gt; the thin, dark, night-air reminded me of ho=\r\nw we use a fork to lift pieces of\n&gt; food - meat or vegetables, both dead - =\r\nfrom our plates to our mouths. Manish\n&gt; asked me smiling, &quot;Maza aya?&quot;. I sm=\r\niled back in acknowledgement. Then he\n&gt; commented that I should write about=\r\n this experience in the coming days. Let\n&gt; people know.\n&gt;\n&gt; By this time I =\r\nremembered that when I was sitting and doing the Chandi\n&gt; path, one dog had=\r\n run off with one of my chappals. I informed Manish. He\n&gt; exclaimed, &quot; Kya =\r\nbaat hai! Leave the other chappal here as well.&quot; Manish\n&gt; said we had a rna=\r\n with this samshan. We had been here before, in some life.\n&gt;\n&gt; As we were r=\r\neturning, Manish said one of the point (the three peaks) of\n&gt; Shiva&#39;s trish=\r\nul passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it is a &quot;safe&quot;\n&gt; samshan. Any=\r\none who tries anything negative here will face troubles. The\n&gt; trishul of S=\r\nhiva guards this place. No spirit will cause any unnecessary\n&gt; disturbance =\r\ninside the samshan. That is also why there are people here even\n&gt; at 2 am i=\r\nn the morning. There is safety in numbers. As long as ones\n&gt; intentions are=\r\n genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wonderful place to do\n&gt; sadhana.\n&gt;\n&gt; Wh=\r\nile walking along the ghats which were totally deserted, Manish\n&gt; instructe=\r\nd me not to stop. The knot in my red lungi was becoming loose, I\n&gt; caught h=\r\nold of it with one hand and kept moving fast, trying to keep pace\n&gt; with Ma=\r\nnish. Later Manish asked me if I had got some smell. I thought and\n&gt; recoll=\r\nected that yes, I did get a faint smell of heena. Twice. Manish told\n&gt; me i=\r\nt was a &quot;Mokul&quot;. A muslim spirit of similar level as a Yaksha or a\n&gt; Yakshi=\r\nni. Once the ritual is over, and you are out of the samshan, do not\n&gt; wait =\r\nalong the banks, he instructed. Do not move too close to the water late\n&gt; i=\r\nn the nightt. There are things in the water. Generally they may not do\n&gt; an=\r\nything, but why take a chance. The protection of Shiva is only inside the\n&gt;=\r\n Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya Baba (I may have mis-spelt the\n&gt; =\r\nname) used to live in the middle of this Ganges 24/7. This is a city of\n&gt; s=\r\naints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas would roam around naked. It is\n&gt; th=\r\neir city.\n&gt;\n&gt; Next morning, as we sat recollecting the previous night&#39;s hom=\r\na, Manish\n&gt; talked about Vedas. Few sadhaks, if ever, are equally comfortab=\r\nle with both\n&gt; paths of Aghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra to show its eff=\r\nects, one must\n&gt; get the intonation perfect. This age most people cannot do=\r\n that. I enquired\n&gt; that I had heard from someone that a certain procedure =\r\nneeds to be done\n&gt; before one starts any sadhana in the samshan. Manish lau=\r\nghed and\n&gt; replied, &quot;Karna to sab kuch chahiye, par mujhe to kuch nehi aata=\r\n!&quot;. I was\n&gt; dumbstruck.\n&gt;\n&gt; While talking about Ramayana with Arunisha, his=\r\n eyes suddenly become half\n&gt; closed. He voice became slow and heavy, &quot;The c=\r\nolor of Rama&#39;s body is deep\n&gt; blue with a golden tinge all around him. Like=\r\n a sun blazing. That was the\n&gt; kavacha given to Rama by Vishwamitra, the re=\r\nal Gayatri with two special\n&gt; samputs. It was impenetrable. And when he sho=\r\nt his arrows, the motion of his\n&gt; hands is so fast that a normal human eye =\r\nwill not able to observe. In 12\n&gt; hours he had destroyed a forest of Ashura=\r\ns. Ravana had a Chandrahaas khadga.\n&gt; It was a mantra shakti he had acquire=\r\nd through sadhana. The Khadga had\n&gt; become part of his right hand, which wo=\r\nuld fly off to kill mercilessly at\n&gt; the slightest command from his mind. S=\r\nuch was the calibre of the enemy.\n&gt;\n&gt; And Rama removed even his Gayatri Kav=\r\nacha, and fought like a normal human\n&gt; being when he defeated Ravana which =\r\nmeans; he even removed the last vestige\n&gt; of his ego of being a God, and fo=\r\nught like a human. Is it any wonder then,\n&gt; that the whole of north India g=\r\noes crazy at the mere mention of the name of\n&gt; Sri Rama?&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; He spoke wit=\r\nh such an energy which cannot be defined, as if he was there\n&gt; and seen it =\r\nall. Rama Naam Satya Hai.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus ends my recounting of our fascinating tr=\r\nip to Kasi.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *\n&gt; Rama Naama Satya Hai..\n&gt; *\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Sat, 16/1/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;* wrote:\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdo=\r\nm] Rama Naam Satya Hai - 2\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Satur=\r\nday, 16 January, 2010, 11:25 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    Dear Narasimha\n&gt;\n&gt; *It may sound w=\r\neird, but this is what happens in real life all the time.\n&gt; You, I, all the=\r\nse people are pieces in another kind of chess game. *\n&gt;\n&gt; Great analogy. Ma=\r\nnish had given this analogy to us after he completed a\n&gt; beautiful Ganapati=\r\n homa last August. There is one divine chess player, and\n&gt; it is totally Hi=\r\ns game.\n&gt;\n&gt; Before I continue with the narration, I would like to mention a=\r\n few points\n&gt; which I found I had not clearly mentioned in my last mail:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;    - At the end of the third day of Chandi homa at Manikarnika samshan,=\r\n we\n&gt;    were standing and watching the pyres burn, when Manish suddenly sa=\r\nid, in the\n&gt;    coming days you will write about this experience in a publi=\r\nc forum.\n&gt;    Therefore my mails.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    - *Caveat*: A homa on a funera=\r\nl pyre is an extreme Aghor sadhana, and\n&gt;    it is not entirely risk free. =\r\nInfact, in many paramparas it is said only\n&gt;    someone who has a direct ag=\r\nya from Samshan Kali or Mahakala can try this\n&gt;    procedure, or someone wh=\r\no has agya from a powerful Guru. It was Manish who\n&gt;    was doing the homa,=\r\n (giving ahutis) I was only doing the Chandi Path.\n&gt;    Therefore, by readi=\r\nng this accounts one should not, on his own, try out this\n&gt;    sadhana.\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt;    - Many people have a negative bias towards Aghor sadhanas and Aghor=\r\nis.\n&gt;    This is party due to lack of knowledge or understanding of the phi=\r\nlosophy\n&gt;    and efficacy of these sadhanas. Moreover, in recent time some =\r\nTV channels\n&gt;    too have made films etc of Aghoris, potraying them as perv=\r\nerted individuals.\n&gt;    This is grossly incorrect. They have no clue what t=\r\nhey are talking about,\n&gt;    and their accounts start with many preconcieved=\r\n biases. Aghora is one of the\n&gt;    many path to the reach the same goals - =\r\nSelf-realization. It is neither bad\n&gt;    nor good. It is a path. Some like =\r\nit, some don&#39;t. Which is ok. We must\n&gt;    follow our chosen path but at the=\r\n same time have a healthy respect for other\n&gt;    paths too. Many great sain=\r\nts and spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru\n&gt;    Dattatreya is consi=\r\ndered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all\n&gt;    Aghoris. Sri Trilan=\r\nga Swami was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master\n&gt;    Aghori. My mails a=\r\nre intended to give a first hand objective account of how\n&gt;    a powerful s=\r\nadhana in the samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just the\n&gt;    cronic=\r\nler.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;    - There are many people in this age who have a desire for t=\r\nhese\n&gt;    sadhanas, who feel an attraction for this kind of a path, but hav=\r\ne no clue\n&gt;    how to go about it. These accounts are ment to tell such peo=\r\nple that these\n&gt;    sadhanas can and do happen even today, it is not a figm=\r\nent of imagination.\n&gt;    The Manikarnika is still as powerful as it was tho=\r\nusands of years ago. But\n&gt;    to go about it and actually be able to do thi=\r\ns sadhana, just like everything\n&gt;    else in life, there is no fixed proced=\r\nures or rules. Keep doing sadhana in\n&gt;    whatever condition you are in rig=\r\nht now and let Nature decide. Like Sai Baba\n&gt;    says, Shradha and Saburi. =\r\nRespect and patience. If the desire is genuine and\n&gt;    deep, and one is re=\r\nady to wait, Nature will one day make arrangements. This\n&gt;    is the eterna=\r\nl promise to every individual because for Her, NOTHING IS\n&gt;    IMPOSSIBLE. =\r\nAnd She is so kind.  In the intruduction to &quot;Aghora - At the\n&gt;    left hand=\r\n of God&quot;, Vimalanada says :\n&gt;\n&gt;  &quot;Publish this book after I am gone. Let pe=\r\nople know the truth. Let them\n&gt; know what is what. Out of the thousands who=\r\n may read it at least a few will\n&gt; be sincere. They will try to learn more,=\r\n and then Nature Herself will make\n&gt; arrangements for them to learn just as=\r\n She did for me, and they will be\n&gt; taught according to their capabilities.=\r\n *The progression will go on; there\n&gt; is nothing to fear*&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Therefore h=\r\nave faith, do sadhana.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Back to the narration. The second day was Asta=\r\nmi Tithi of Krishna Paksha.\n&gt; Manish said it is a powerful night for chita =\r\nhoma. Various shaktis are\n&gt; available on this night which can destroy Ashur=\r\nas. Past midnight we were\n&gt; walking towards Manikarnika along the ghats. No=\r\nt a single person was to be\n&gt; seen anywhere on any of the multitude of ghat=\r\ns which we crossed. Suddenly we\n&gt; found a pack of dogs, fighting among each=\r\n other, blocking our path. We\n&gt; stopped, wondering if there was any alterna=\r\nte route to the samshan. I\n&gt; started mentally chanting a mantra I knew and =\r\npraying to the deity to make\n&gt; our journey smooth. Coincidentally, just at =\r\nthat moment we saw a man coming\n&gt; from the other side who chased the dogs a=\r\nway. Without looking at me Manish\n&gt; said, &quot;Sometimes a simple prayer can wo=\r\nrk wonders but never become to big\n&gt; for your breeches&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; As we passed t=\r\nhe Lalita Ghat Manish said this is a wonderful place. I did\n&gt; not think too=\r\n much about it then since my mind was already pre occupied with\n&gt; the thoug=\r\nhts of what is to come. The next day morning when we again came to\n&gt; the La=\r\nlita Ghat for some shooting, I suddenly felt a pressure on my head,\n&gt; and t=\r\nhen everything became calm. Manish smiled at me and said this is where\n&gt; Tr=\r\nilanga Swami did his tapashya and the energies are still here. I was\n&gt; litt=\r\nle skeptical mentally, since I knew that the samadhi of Trilanga Swami\n&gt; wa=\r\ns at a different ghat, however I did not say anything. Later on returning\n&gt;=\r\n to Mumbai I spoke to someone who was from Beneras and that person confirme=\r\nd\n&gt; that indeed Trilanga Swami used to stay at the Lalita Ghat and do his\n&gt;=\r\n sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed idiot.\n&gt;\n&gt; Back to midnight. We reac=\r\nhed Manikarnika and again it was filled with\n&gt; people. But this time we did=\r\n not wait. We went right inside, and Manish kept\n&gt; looking for a suitable c=\r\nhita. As we came in, again people started staring at\n&gt; us, but they respect=\r\nfully made way for us to pass through to the middle of\n&gt; the samshan. We st=\r\nood exactly at the middle, with Manish observing the\n&gt; different chitas. Th=\r\nere were about 8/10 of them burning. It is said in\n&gt; thousands of years the=\r\nre has not been a single minute when there has not\n&gt; been a body burning in=\r\n here. Therefore it is one of the Mahasamshans in\n&gt; India. There was one ch=\r\nita to my right which Manish was observing, when\n&gt; suddenly I found a mega =\r\nsize bull come and stand right next to the fire. I\n&gt; did not want to sit th=\r\nere, the bull looked dangerous. Before I could voice\n&gt; my concern, Manish s=\r\naid let us go to the other side of the samshan. It not\n&gt; only the bull,  bu=\r\nt there is something else as well. I did not ask him what.\n&gt; So we went to =\r\nanother side. The dom there came forward and said to Manish,\n&gt; &quot;Baba,aap lo=\r\ng kaun se chita me baithna chahate ho?&quot;. Manish indicated one at\n&gt; the end,=\r\n the dome then went ahead and asked the people standing around the\n&gt; chita =\r\nto make space for us to sit. He said the heat from the fire is too\n&gt; stong,=\r\n but Manish said it&#39;s ok, we&#39;ll sit here itself. There were many\n&gt; curious =\r\nonlookers, but all made space for us to sit comfortably. I could\n&gt; hear the=\r\n dom instructing others not to disturb the pyre we were sitting at.\n&gt; This =\r\nis something very unique about Manikarnika. IN any other city, people\n&gt; wou=\r\nld have objected, but not here. Manish later said, it is a tradition of\n&gt; t=\r\nhis place, Aghor sadhanas have been done in here for countless centuries.\n&gt;=\r\n Therefore the domes have either themsleves seen these things or heard from=\r\n\n&gt; their families and thus they do not disturb.\n&gt;\n&gt; The homa, as usual was =\r\nawesome. The pyre was larger than the one previous\n&gt; night. The heat was ve=\r\nry strong. My focus was stronger. My mind was much\n&gt; calmer than the previo=\r\nus night. Within ten minutes again a pack of dogs came\n&gt; and sat around thi=\r\ns pyre. This was strange because there were at least ten\n&gt; pyres burning, a=\r\nnd all of them chose this specific pyre for some\n&gt; inexplicable reason. Dog=\r\ns have a far subtler sense perception than average\n&gt; humans like me. This h=\r\noma was extended longer. Every now and then Manish\n&gt; would suddenly look at=\r\n a certain direction intently for a few second. I too\n&gt; would turn and look=\r\n that way but saw nothing. But, everytime Manish looked\n&gt; at a specific dir=\r\nection or made some gestures, the dogs too would start\n&gt; barking at that di=\r\nrection. At one point I almost felt a bit jealous of the\n&gt; dogs, they could=\r\n see/sense things which I  - being such an ordinary person\n&gt; - obviously ha=\r\nd no clue about. In the middle of the Chandi path I could hear\n&gt; chants of =\r\n&quot;Ram Nam Satya Hai&quot; and relatives wailing as new bodies were being\n&gt; brough=\r\nt in.\n&gt;\n&gt; Suddenly to my right there was a sound and quite abit of smoke, I=\r\n saw a\n&gt; transformer bursting. The dogs immediately started barking at that=\r\n. Later\n&gt; Manish said the Goddess was moving around, entering the fire and =\r\nleaving the\n&gt; fire. The bursting of the transformer had a link to this. As =\r\nthe Path was\n&gt; going on - the Chandi was in my right hand - I saw a human s=\r\nhadow pass\n&gt; over the pages of the book. I thought it was some relative who=\r\n was standing\n&gt; behind me. I looked back and was a shocked to find there wa=\r\ns no one behind\n&gt; me. And the shadow passed over my book once again. This t=\r\nime I did not look\n&gt; back. Just kept chanting with more vigor and saying to=\r\n myself &quot;all iz\n&gt; well&quot;-:).  Manish later said, as one does sadhana the dei=\r\nty often comes to\n&gt; observe and make his/her presence felt, even if slightl=\r\ny. It is not an\n&gt; imagination but reality and this can happen not just in a=\r\n samshan but in any\n&gt; sadhana anywhere. The idea is to keep doing sadhana.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; While offering coconuts into the fire, one coconut rolled off from the\n=\r\n&gt; pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which the domes use to stroke the fir=\r\ne\n&gt; and pushed the coconut piece inside.I wondered if I had been a dom in a=\r\nny of\n&gt; my past lives, because I strangely felt natural stroking the pyre t=\r\nhe way\n&gt; the domes do. I even wondered if there was any company which would=\r\n may me\n&gt; for this kind of a job, I would happily take it. What better way =\r\nto do\n&gt; sadhana than become a dom at Manikarkina! Interestingly, I then rem=\r\nembered\n&gt; that Manish had bought one extra coconut while buying the samagri=\r\n to\n&gt; tonight&#39;s homas. Now I understood why.\n&gt;\n&gt; In the middle of the homa,=\r\n suddenly Manish called one of the relatives who\n&gt; was standing nearby and =\r\ntold him that the person whos body was in the pyre\n&gt; has just left and that=\r\n they (relatives) do not have to wait any more. It was\n&gt; already late in th=\r\ne night. The person did not know what to say. Suddenly\n&gt; Manish explained t=\r\no him, do not worry, there is nothing evil or bad being\n&gt; done here. We are=\r\n only praying to Ma Durga. I guess the person was mentally\n&gt; wondering abou=\r\nt what is going on. Then another of the relatives came forward\n&gt; and said, =\r\n&quot;Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge&quot;. So Manish said ok and\n&gt; asked the=\r\nm to sit down and continued with the homa. In the middle of the\n&gt; homa sudd=\r\nenly Manish asked me to observe the skin on the corpse  I saw the\n&gt; skin on=\r\n the face had caught fire and was burning. It was a sight to see!\n&gt;\n&gt; There=\r\n is a tradition of pouring Ganges water at the end to finsh the fire.\n&gt; But=\r\n I could hear the domes telling the relatives not to pour water on the\n&gt; py=\r\nre or do anything there without permissin from Manish. Finally at the end\n&gt;=\r\n they came to Manish and asked if they could pour some Ganges water. Manish=\r\n\n&gt; said ok, but in a low voice told me nothing will happen to the fire, it\n=\r\n&gt; won&#39;t die. They poured a large mud kalash full of water but nothing happe=\r\nned\n&gt; to the fire. It kept burning. After some times, after some more ahuti=\r\ns,\n&gt; Manish called the people and said, &quot; Devi samne khadi hai. App log pra=\r\nnam\n&gt; kijiye&quot;. At least 10/15 people came forward and reventially bowed to =\r\nthe\n&gt; fire. Then they wanted to touch Manish&#39;s feet, but Manish would not l=\r\net them\n&gt; do so. They asked for his blessings. He distributed some flower p=\r\netals we\n&gt; had and told them to go home, since it was very late in the nigh=\r\nt. Suddenly\n&gt; the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had addressed earli=\r\ner) came\n&gt; running with tears in his eyes asking for forgiveness for having=\r\n doubted.\n&gt; Manish consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he has done no =\r\nwrong,\n&gt; everything is all right.  Later Manish said, if it was some other =\r\ntime of\n&gt; the day he would have brought the man along for a cup of tea. Ano=\r\nther person\n&gt; suddenly came to Manish and asked him if he was a certain sai=\r\nnt (a famous\n&gt; saint) who used to live in Kasi. Manish without responding t=\r\no his query\n&gt; asked him where was he from, the person replied interior Biha=\r\nr. Manish\n&gt; advised him to go back home as it was late in the night. The fa=\r\nith of the\n&gt; ordinary people of this land is what makes India so unique, th=\r\nat is why our\n&gt; land and culture is still so alive. We city bred &#39;educated&#39;=\r\n people are too\n&gt; rational to understand these things. God loves the simple=\r\n and uncalculating.\n&gt; By this time I too stood up to do pranam to the fire.=\r\n Immediately I felt as\n&gt; if my body existed only from my head to my heart, =\r\nthere was nothing below,\n&gt; no legs, no stomach , as if I was simply floatin=\r\ng on thin air! I told Manish\n&gt; what happened, he just gave a curt one word =\r\nreply, &quot;Good&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; As we were walking back from Manikarnika Manish sudd=\r\nenly said, &quot;There is a\n&gt; foreigner lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who=\r\n has a lot of desire to\n&gt; perform sadhanas in the samshan but does not know=\r\n how to go about it. I saw\n&gt; her while meditating.&quot; For a woman to come and=\r\n perform these sadhanas is\n&gt; practically difficult or impossible, unless sh=\r\ne is a Yogini or a sadhaka of\n&gt; great calibre. Ordinary people would not be=\r\n able to meet the gaze of a\n&gt; Yogini, said Manish. The next morning, when w=\r\ne came to the Lalita Ghat (as I\n&gt; mentioned above), I saw a thin, frail, lo=\r\noking foreigner lady sitting on the\n&gt; banks. Manish quitely indicated to me=\r\n that, that is the lady whom he had\n&gt; seen last night in his meditation at =\r\nthe samshan. &quot;She has desire, but\n&gt; directionless. &quot; At that time there was=\r\n nothing more we could do. I guess\n&gt; that is why it is so important to keep=\r\n doing some sadhana on your own,\n&gt; instead of merely contemplating which is=\r\n of no good, so that you are ready\n&gt; when Nature decides to give you a push=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; After passing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon, we stood and observed\n=\r\n&gt; Manikarnika from a distance. We were dressed like any other tourist,\n&gt; sp=\r\necially with Manish&#39;s camera hanging from his neck and the tripod. Manish\n&gt;=\r\n smiled and said let us not go too close to Manikarnika, what if the doms\n&gt;=\r\n recognize us! They would be shell shocked seeing us dressed as tourists,\n&gt;=\r\n wondering what is going on.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus ended my second day of observing a Ch=\r\nandi homa on a funeral pyre at\n&gt; the famed Manikarnika Ghats of Kashi.\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n-Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; *\n&gt; Rama Naam Satya Hai\n&gt; *\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; -------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; The INTERNET now has a personality.

I was writi=\r\nng in a flow and never checked what I wrote. Kindly pardon such errors and =\r\nread through them. As they say, &quot;Bhavnayoko samjho!&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;During the day time, we roame=\r\nd around shooting at different places. In this 3 days we never visited any =\r\nof the temples in Kasi. I asked him, &quot;What about the temples? Won&#39;=\r\nt we visit them?&quot;. Manish retorted immediately, &quot;=A0Aren&#39;t we=\r\n=A0going to the most powerful temple in Kasi every night?&quot;! I silently=\r\n agreed. This is something about Manish I have observed. He rarely enters t=\r\nemples or standard places of worship, but suddenly he might see a small roa=\r\ndside temple and stand and stare for sometimes, even do a pranam and then r=\r\nemark, &quot;There is something here.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Duri=\r\nng evening we went to visit the Kinnaram Ashram. Kinnaram Baba was a Aghori=\r\n who lived in Kasi=A0during the 16th century. The place is called Aghor-sth=\r\nal. Before entering Manish bought some bel leaves. As we walked inside the =\r\nAshram, Manish became silent, then said there are strong energies in here. =\r\nInside we meditated for sometime, Manish did=A0 pranam=A0at the samadhi of =\r\nBaba Bhagwan Ram who was the 11th head of the Ashram. Baba Bhagwan Ram had =\r\nentered Nirvikalpa Samadhi while meditating for 3 continuous days at the Ma=\r\nnikarnika Samshan.=A0 Manish, on being=A0questioned, said that many sadhana=\r\ns have been done here in this place for long by people with no mundane desi=\r\nres. Therefore, the energies are strong here. While looking around the Ashr=\r\nam we found some quotations which were written in small wooden boards. Mani=\r\nsh called Arunisha and me and pointed to one quotation. Translated to Engli=\r\nsh, it read, &quot;If you have to give your head\n off to get a sadguru, you=\r\n have=A0got it cheap&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;By 8 PM we sat for di=\r\nnner. We used to have early dinners, so that we had sufficient time before =\r\ngoing to the samshan. Ideally you should have an empty stomach while perfor=\r\nming any sadhana to get the best effects. The amount of fire in the body is=\r\n fixed. There is one that digests food - Jathara Agni. One that digests ide=\r\nas/concepts/experiences - Bhuta Agni (existential fire) which exists in the=\r\n subtle body. It is the second which must increase in order for one to &quo=\r\nt;digest&quot; various experiences/ideas/etc. It can only increase when the=\r\n Jathara Agni is less, i.e. you do not have a full stomach. When we are ext=\r\nremely focused on something and working intently on the same, we forget foo=\r\nd, we do not feel hungry. This is due to the increase in Bhuta Agni and dec=\r\nrease in Jathara Agni.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;As we sat eating our food=\r\n and talking on different topics, we discussed history.The conversation men=\r\ntioned here is a thread picked up from an earlier conversation that we (Man=\r\nish, Arunisha and=A0me) had before coming to Kasi. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;Manish said, &quot;It is the same set of=A0souls who come back=A0again =\r\nand again in different bodies and personalities at different times, who=A0a=\r\nre responsible for this land. There was Chadragupta and Chanakya, there was=\r\n Prithviraj, there was Akbar, Shankaracharya, Ramakrishna etc.&quot; He con=\r\ntinued, &quot;They can come as kings, yogis, or any other form which is nec=\r\nessary for them to accomplish their dharma. And their dharma is connected t=\r\no this land=A0which we call India=A0today.This land is connected to the Ris=\r\nhis. This is Rishi bhoomi. And Rishis sent people when needed.=A0Prithviraj=\r\n made one mistake, of pardoning Ghori. Imagine what happened to that woman =\r\nwho made Prithiviraj disobey his Guru?&quot;.I silently contemplated her fa=\r\nte.=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&quot;One very senior Rishi has decided t=\r\no=A0change this land back to a Rishi bhoomi. And so shall it happen.=A0Ved=\r\n=A0Dharma will be re established here along the length and breadth. Nothing=\r\n, however powerful or mightly, be it an individual or=A0group,=A0can stand =\r\nagainst the will of a Rishi.&quot;=A0 Arunisha asked a pertinent question h=\r\nere. &quot;What were the Rishis doing for=A0one thousand years?&quot;. Mani=\r\nsh laughed and said, &quot; A Rishi can very well spend a thousand years si=\r\nmply in samadhi, meditating. Then suddenly=A0one day=A0wake up from meditat=\r\nion=A0and see that Rishi bhoomi is gone=A0and all sorts of non-spiritual th=\r\nings going on here. So He decides, it is time to get back and re create the=\r\n Rishi bhoomi. You guys have no clue about=A0what a Rishi can do. One Rishi=\r\n is enough to change a universe, changing a country is child&#39;s play for=\r\n Him.&quot; Wow. I let all these sink inside me slowly. Therefore it is so =\r\nimportant to keep\n doing sadhana, in some manner or the other.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;As night approached midnight, Manish and I left for the Mani=\r\nkarnika again. This was going be our last night of Chandi homa at Manikarni=\r\nka, for now. We walked long the=A0deserted ghats, sliently. I asked him if =\r\nit is ok doing a=A0homa of Shiva/Bhairava on a pyre. He said=A0yes why not,=\r\n but without Shakti, there will be no Shiva. Worshipping the divine feminie=\r\n is the most practical strategy of sadhana. Shiva is the state of highest c=\r\nonsciousness, and to reach that stage one must develop his body and mind su=\r\nch that it can hold shakti=A0for which=A0worshipping the divine Mother is t=\r\nhe best way.=A0That is why Vimalananda says, &quot;Let the Mother show you =\r\nthe face of the Father&quot;. The topic drifted to Vimalananda. Manish said=\r\n, &quot;Kala Bhairava is very strong in Manikarnika, where as Mahakala exis=\r\nts powerfully in the cremation grouds at Ujjain. But Vimalananda did Mahaka=\r\nla sadhana here in Manikarnika.&quot; Then staring at the pitch black gange=\r\ns,\n Manish chuckled lightly and added, &quot;That man was something.&quot; =\r\nThis was again an old conversation we had started=A0before which Mainsh con=\r\ntinued, &quot;All these babas of today would wet their pants if Vimalananda=\r\n were to stand infornt of them. Those three books have the power of a deity=\r\n flowing through them. Without being physically present, Vimalananda has cr=\r\neated a army of sadhakas!&quot;. I interjected, &quot;The books=A0are like =\r\na Bible=A0for sadhakas,=A0arn&#39;t they?&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot; said Manis=\r\nh. Later on I asked him if it was possible for someone to meet Vimalanada, =\r\nto which Manish replied that yes it was, if one does serious sadhana. Howev=\r\ner, the important question is whether one will be able to recognize him. I =\r\nfell silent hearing this. Interestingly, in the 2nd book of the Aghora seri=\r\nes, Vimalanda does mention that a time will come when his &quot;children&qu=\r\not; would spread homas. Strange, or maybe not so. Who knows how deep things=\r\n run. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;We reached the samshan by half past twelv=\r\ne. This time we sat at the same place where we had sat on the first day of =\r\nhoma. The fire was low. Most of the body had been burnt already. Manish sta=\r\nrted the homa. As usual, all the dogs came and sat peacefully around the fi=\r\nre. Now this did not surprise me any more. In the middle of the homa Manish=\r\n would slowly lift his=A0palm upwards=A0and with the next ahuti=A0immediate=\r\nly the fire would leap higher. He did this quite a few times, when=A0the fl=\r\names were getting weaker. I countinued with the Chandi path and passing on =\r\nthe samagri to him as and when he required anything. One dom who was workin=\r\ng on a pyre nearby, came towards us and exclaimed,&quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. =\r\nManish too responded back, &quot;Jai Mahadev&quot;. This homa was faster. H=\r\ne did not use any &quot;samputs&quot;, but a direct, straight Chandi homa. =\r\nAgain in the middle I got up and stroked the pyre a bit, pushing around som=\r\ne of the coconut pieces to make them\n burn properly. I was enjoying it. A f=\r\new people came and sat near us, listening to the path. In Kasi there is a r=\r\nule that whatever comes in the Samshan is the property of the Dom Raja (the=\r\n head of doms). No one has any further claim on it. In old times, one Dom R=\r\naja was called Kallu Dom. He was an Aghori and a contemporary of Kinnaram B=\r\naba. It is said he could raise the dead back to life. Maybe it is because o=\r\nf this tradition that Manikarnika is such an apt place for these sadhanas. =\r\nI was at one point mentally wondering why are there so many people in the s=\r\namshan. The Manish said, if a Nath came here in his garb, everyone will run=\r\n away from the samshan scared. But there is a reason why there are people h=\r\nere even so late in the night.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Once the final pu=\r\nrnahuti was given, we sat for meditation. Though this homa got over faster =\r\nthan previous days, the meditation that happened, for me, was superb. At on=\r\ne point I felt as if my mind would just burst forth and expand across the l=\r\nength and breadth of the Ganges. My focus was good, but I had to open my ey=\r\nes after every 20 minutes or so. Manish continued meditating for nearly an =\r\nhour. Not the slightest movement from him. Nothing. Still like a stone. The=\r\nn a cow came and slightly nudged Manish on his feet. That made him open his=\r\n eyes. Manish remarked, &quot; I could have just left my body and gone off.=\r\n It did not matter that I had a flight to catch the next day, or anything e=\r\nlse. I was on the verge of death. Just at that moment the cow and brought m=\r\ne back.&quot; Smiling he added, &quot;What a sight it would have been for t=\r\nhe people to see, how the body can be left at will&quot;.=A0 I did not know=\r\n what to say. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;We stood there watching another p=\r\nyre in front. The body was half burnt. The torso had become black with deep=\r\n=A0red patches all over. The dom came forward, and with the bamboo stick in=\r\nserted it (the bamboo stick)=A0from the side of the corpse, lifting up the =\r\nburning torso into the air and placing it again, strategically, in the midd=\r\nle of the pyre. The smooth=A0motion of lifting up the half burnt torso, sti=\r\ncking out from one end of the bamboo stick,=A0into the thin, dark, night-ai=\r\nr reminded me of how we use a fork to lift pieces of food - meat=A0or veget=\r\nables, both dead -=A0from our plates to our mouths. Manish asked me smiling=\r\n, &quot;Maza aya?&quot;. I smiled back in acknowledgement. Then he commente=\r\nd=A0that I should write about this experience in the coming days. Let peopl=\r\ne know.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;By this time I remembered that when I wa=\r\ns sitting and doing the Chandi path, one dog=A0had run off with one of my c=\r\nhappals. I informed Manish. He exclaimed, &quot; Kya baat hai! Leave the ot=\r\nher chappal here as well.&quot; Manish said we had a rna with this samshan.=\r\n We had been here before, in some life.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;As we we=\r\nre returning, Manish said one of the point (the three peaks)=A0of Shiva&#39=\r\n;s trishul passes through the Manikarkina. Therefore, it is a &quot;safe&qu=\r\not; samshan. Anyone who tries anything negative here will face troubles. Th=\r\ne trishul of Shiva guards this place. No spirit will cause any unnecessary =\r\ndisturbance inside the samshan. That is also why there are people here even=\r\n at 2 am in the morning. There is safety in numbers. As long as ones intent=\r\nions are genuine and good, Manikarnika is a wonderful place to do sadhana.&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;While walking along the ghats=A0which were=A0tot=\r\nally deserted, Manish instructed me not to stop. The knot in my red lungi w=\r\nas becoming loose, I caught hold of it=A0with one=A0hand and kept moving fa=\r\nst, trying to keep pace with Manish. Later Manish asked me if I had got som=\r\ne smell. I thought and recollected that yes, I did get a faint smell of hee=\r\nna. Twice. Manish told me it was a &quot;Mokul&quot;. A muslim spirit of si=\r\nmilar level as a Yaksha or a Yakshini. Once the ritual is over, and you are=\r\n out of the samshan, do not wait along the banks, he instructed. Do not mov=\r\ne too close to the water=A0late in the nightt. There are things in the wate=\r\nr. Generally they may not do anything, but why take a chance. The protectio=\r\nn of Shiva is only inside the Manikarnika Ghat. Then he added, Deoriya Baba=\r\n (I may have mis-spelt the name) used to live in the middle of this Ganges =\r\n24/7. This is a city of saints. Here God-intoxicated Paramhamsas would roam=\r\n around\n naked. It is their city.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Next morning, a=\r\ns we sat recollecting the previous night&#39;s homa, Manish talked about Ve=\r\ndas.=A0Few sadhaks, if ever, are equally comfortable with both paths of=A0A=\r\nghora and Vedas. For a Veda mantra to show its effects, one must get the in=\r\ntonation perfect. This age most people cannot do that. I=A0enquired that I =\r\nhad heard from someone that a certain procedure needs to be done before one=\r\n starts any sadhana in the samshan. Manish=A0laughed and replied,=A0&quot;K=\r\narna to sab kuch chahiye, par mujhe to kuch nehi aata!&quot;.=A0I was dumbs=\r\ntruck.=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;While talking about Ramayana with Arun=\r\nisha, his eyes suddenly become half closed. He voice became slow and heavy,=\r\n=A0&quot;The color of Rama&#39;s body is deep blue with a golden tinge all=\r\n=A0around him. Like a sun blazing. That=A0was the kavacha given to Rama by =\r\nVishwamitra, the real Gayatri with two special samputs. It was impenetrable=\r\n. And when he shot his arrows, the motion of his hands=A0is so fast that a =\r\nnormal human eye will not able to observe. In 12 hours he had destroyed a f=\r\norest of Ashuras.=A0Ravana had a Chandrahaas khadga. It was a=A0mantra shak=\r\nti he had acquired through sadhana. The Khadga had become part of his right=\r\n hand, which would fly off to kill mercilessly at the slightest=A0command f=\r\nrom his mind. Such was the calibre of the enemy. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;And Rama removed even=A0his Gayatri Kavacha, and fought like a normal hum=\r\nan being when he defeated Ravana which=A0means; he even removed the last ve=\r\nstige of his ego of being a God, and fought like a human. Is it any wonder =\r\nthen, that the whole of north India goes crazy at the mere mention of the n=\r\name of Sri Rama?&quot;. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;He spoke with such an e=\r\nnergy which cannot be defined, as if he was there and seen it all. Rama Naa=\r\nm Satya Hai.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Thus ends my recounting of our fasci=\r\nnating trip to Kasi.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0Rajar=\r\nshi&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-size: 10pt; color: navy; font-family: Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; =\r\nface=3D&quot;Courier&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00007f&quot;&gt;Rama Naama Satya Hai..&lt;=\r\n/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Sat, 16/1/10=\r\n, rajarshi nandy &lt;i&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@...&quot; target=3D=\r\n&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rajarshi14@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: rajarshi nandy &lt=\r\n;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:rajarshi14@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;rajarshi14@yah=\r\noo.co.in&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Rama Naam Satya Hai - 2&lt;br&gt;\nTo:=\r\n &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;Date: Saturday, 16 January, 2010, 11:25 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;table border=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0=\r\n&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Dear Narasimha&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;It may sound weird, but this is what happens in=\r\n real life all the time. You, I, all these people are pieces in another kin=\r\nd of chess game. &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Great analogy. Manish had g=\r\niven this analogy to us after he=A0completed a beautiful=A0Ganapati homa la=\r\nst August. There is=A0one divine chess player, and it is totally His game. =\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Before I continue with the narration, I would li=\r\nke to mention a few points which I found I had not clearly mentioned in my =\r\nlast mail:&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;At the end of the third day of Cha=\r\nndi homa at Manikarnika samshan, we were standing and watching the pyres bu=\r\nrn, when Manish suddenly said, in the coming days you will write about this=\r\n experience in a public forum. Therefore my mails.&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Caveat&lt;/b&gt;: A homa on a funeral pyre is an extreme Aghor=A0sa=\r\ndhana, and it is not entirely risk free. Infact, in many paramparas it is s=\r\naid=A0only someone who has a direct agya from Samshan Kali or Mahakala can =\r\ntry this procedure, or someone who has agya from a powerful Guru. It was Ma=\r\nnish who was doing the homa, (giving ahutis)=A0I was only doing the Chandi =\r\nPath. Therefore, by reading this accounts one should not, on his own, try o=\r\nut this sadhana. &lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;Many people have a neg=\r\native=A0bias towards Aghor sadhanas and Aghoris. This is party due to lack =\r\nof knowledge or understanding of the philosophy and efficacy of these sadha=\r\nnas. Moreover, in recent time some TV channels too have made films etc of A=\r\nghoris, potraying them as perverted individuals. This is grossly incorrect.=\r\n They have no clue what they are talking about, and their accounts start wi=\r\nth many preconcieved biases. Aghora is one of the many path to the reach th=\r\ne same goals - Self-realization. It is neither bad nor good. It is a path. =\r\nSome like it, some don&#39;t. Which is ok. We must follow our chosen path b=\r\nut at the same time have a healthy respect for other paths too. Many great =\r\nsaints and spiritual giants have taken this path. Guru Dattatreya is consid=\r\nered the first Aghori. The 9 great Naths were all Aghoris. Sri Trilanga Swa=\r\nmi was an Aghori too. Vimalanada was a master Aghori. My mails are intended=\r\n to give a first hand\n objective=A0account of how a powerful sadhana in the=\r\n samshan is performed. Nothing more. I am just the cronicler.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;ul&gt;\n&lt;li&gt;There are many people in this age who have a desire fo=\r\nr these sadhanas, who feel an attraction for this kind of a path, but have =\r\nno clue how to go about it. These accounts are ment to tell such=A0people t=\r\nhat these sadhanas can and do happen even today, it is not a figment of ima=\r\ngination. The Manikarnika is still as powerful as it was thousands of years=\r\n ago. But to go about it and=A0actually be able to do this sadhana, just li=\r\nke everything else in life, there is no fixed procedures or rules. Keep doi=\r\nng sadhana in whatever condition you are in right now=A0and let Nature deci=\r\nde. Like Sai Baba says, Shradha and Saburi. Respect and patience. If the de=\r\nsire is genuine and deep, and one is ready to wait, Nature will one day mak=\r\ne arrangements. This is the eternal promise to every individual=A0because f=\r\nor Her, NOTHING IS IMPOSSIBLE. And She is so=A0kind.=A0 In the intruduction=\r\n to &quot;Aghora - At the left hand of God&quot;, Vimalanada says :&lt;/li&gt;\n&lt;/=\r\nul&gt;\n&lt;blockquote dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;\n&lt;blockquote dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&quot;Publish th=\r\nis book after I am gone. Let people know the truth. Let them know what is w=\r\nhat. Out of the thousands who may read it at least a few will be sincere. T=\r\nhey will try to learn more, and then Nature Herself will make arrangements =\r\nfor them to learn just as She did for me, and they will be taught according=\r\n to their capabilities. &lt;u&gt;The progression will go on; there is nothing to =\r\nfear&lt;/u&gt;&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;p dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Therefore have faith, do=\r\n sadhana.=A0 \n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Back to the =\r\nnarration. The second day was Astami Tithi of Krishna Paksha. Manish said i=\r\nt is a powerful night for chita homa. Various shaktis are available on this=\r\n night which can destroy Ashuras.=A0Past midnight we were walking towards M=\r\nanikarnika along the ghats. Not a single person was to be seen anywhere on =\r\nany of the multitude of ghats which we crossed. Suddenly we found a pack of=\r\n dogs, fighting among each other, blocking our path. We stopped, wondering =\r\nif there was any alternate route to the samshan. I started mentally chantin=\r\ng a mantra I knew and praying to the deity to make our journey smooth. Coin=\r\ncidentally, just at that moment we saw a man coming from the other side who=\r\n chased the dogs away.=A0Without looking at me=A0Manish said, &quot;Sometim=\r\nes a simple prayer can work wonders but never become to big for your breech=\r\nes&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;As we passed the Lalita Ghat Manish sa=\r\nid this is a wonderful place.=A0I did not think too much about it then sinc=\r\ne my mind was already pre occupied with the thoughts of what is to come. Th=\r\ne next day morning when we again came to the Lalita Ghat for some shooting,=\r\n I suddenly felt a pressure on my head, and then everything became calm. Ma=\r\nnish smiled at me and said this is where Trilanga Swami did his tapashya an=\r\nd the energies are still here. I was little skeptical mentally, since I kne=\r\nw that the samadhi of Trilanga Swami was at a different ghat, however I did=\r\n not say anything.=A0Later on returning to Mumbai I spoke to someone who wa=\r\ns from Beneras and that person confirmed that indeed Trilanga Swami used to=\r\n stay at the Lalita Ghat and do his sadhana. Conclusion, I am a confirmed i=\r\ndiot.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Back to midnight. We reached Manikarnika a=\r\nnd again it was filled with people. But this time we did not wait. We went =\r\nright inside, and Manish kept looking for a suitable chita. As we came in, =\r\nagain people started staring at us, but they respectfully made way for us t=\r\no pass through to the middle of the samshan. We stood exactly at the middle=\r\n, with Manish observing the different chitas. There were about 8/10 of them=\r\n burning. It is said in thousands of years there has not been a single minu=\r\nte when there has not been a body burning in here. Therefore it is one of t=\r\nhe Mahasamshans in India. There was one chita to my right which Manish was =\r\nobserving, when suddenly I found a mega size bull come and stand right next=\r\n to the fire. I did not want to sit there, the bull looked dangerous. Befor=\r\ne I could voice my concern, Manish said let us go to the other side of the =\r\nsamshan. It not only the bull,=A0 but there is something else as well. I di=\r\nd not ask him\n what. So we went to another side. The dom there came forward=\r\n and said to Manish, &quot;Baba,aap log=A0kaun se chita me baithna chahate =\r\nho?&quot;. Manish indicated one at the end, the dome then went ahead and as=\r\nked the people standing around the chita to make space for us to sit. He sa=\r\nid the heat from the fire is too stong, but Manish said it&#39;s ok, we&#39=\r\n;ll sit here itself. There were many curious onlookers, but all made space =\r\nfor us to sit comfortably. I could hear the dom instructing others not to d=\r\nisturb the pyre we were sitting at. This is something very unique about Man=\r\nikarnika. IN any other city, people would have objected, but not here. Mani=\r\nsh later said, it is a tradition of this place, Aghor sadhanas have been do=\r\nne in here for countless centuries. Therefore the domes have either themsle=\r\nves seen these things or heard from their families and thus they do not dis=\r\nturb. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;The homa, as usual was awesome. The pyre =\r\nwas larger than the one previous night. The heat was very strong. My focus =\r\nwas stronger. My mind was much calmer than the previous night. Within ten m=\r\ninutes again a pack of dogs came and sat around this pyre. This was strange=\r\n because=A0there were at least ten pyres burning, and all of them chose thi=\r\ns specific pyre for some inexplicable reason. Dogs have a far subtler sense=\r\n perception than average humans like me. This homa was extended longer. Eve=\r\nry now and then Manish would suddenly look at a certain direction intently =\r\nfor a few second. I too would turn and look that way but saw nothing. But, =\r\neverytime Manish looked at a specific direction or made some gestures, the =\r\ndogs too would start barking at that direction. At one point I almost felt =\r\na bit jealous of the dogs, they could see/sense things which I=A0 - being s=\r\nuch an=A0ordinary person -=A0obviously had no clue about. In the middle of =\r\nthe Chandi\n path=A0I could hear chants of &quot;Ram Nam Satya Hai&quot; and=\r\n relatives wailing as new bodies were being brought in. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Suddenly to my right there was a sound and quite abit of smoke, I s=\r\naw a transformer bursting. The dogs immediately started barking at that. La=\r\nter Manish said the Goddess was moving around, entering the fire and leavin=\r\ng the fire. The bursting of the transformer had a link to this. As the Path=\r\n was going on - the Chandi was in my right hand - I saw a human shadow pass=\r\n over=A0the pages of the=A0book. I thought it was some relative who was sta=\r\nnding behind me.=A0I looked back and was a shocked to find there was no one=\r\n behind me. And the shadow passed over my book once again. This time I did =\r\nnot look back. Just kept chanting with more vigor and saying to myself &quo=\r\nt;all iz well&quot;-:).=A0 Manish later said, as one does sadhana the deity=\r\n often comes to observe and make his/her presence felt, even if slightly.=\r\n=A0It is not an imagination but reality and this can=A0happen not just in a=\r\n samshan but in any sadhana anywhere. The idea is to keep doing\n sadhana.&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;While offering coconuts into the fire, one coconut=\r\n rolled off from the pyre. So I took a long bamboo stick which the domes us=\r\ne to stroke the fire and pushed the coconut piece inside.I wondered if I=A0=\r\nhad been a dom in any of my past lives, because I strangely felt natural st=\r\nroking the pyre=A0the way the domes do. I even wondered if=A0there was any =\r\ncompany which would may me for this kind of a job, I would happily take it.=\r\n What better way to do sadhana than become a dom at Manikarkina!=A0Interest=\r\ningly, I then remembered that Manish had bought one extra coconut while buy=\r\ning the samagri to tonight&#39;s homas. Now I understood why.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;In the middle of the homa, suddenly Manish called one of the=\r\n relatives who was standing nearby and told him=A0that the person whos body=\r\n was in the pyre has just left and that=A0they (relatives) do not have to w=\r\nait any more. It was already late in the night. The person did not know wha=\r\nt to say. Suddenly Manish explained to him, do not worry, there is nothing =\r\nevil or bad being done here. We are only praying to Ma Durga. I guess the p=\r\nerson was mentally wondering about what is going on. Then another of the re=\r\nlatives came forward and said, &quot;Baba, hum log ahsirwad leke hi jayenge=\r\n&quot;. So Manish said ok and asked them to sit down and continued with the=\r\n homa. In the middle of the homa suddenly Manish asked me to observe the sk=\r\nin on the corpse=A0 I saw the skin on the face had caught fire and was burn=\r\ning. It was a sight to see!&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;There is a tradition=\r\n of pouring Ganges water=A0at the end to finsh the fire. But I could hear t=\r\nhe domes telling the relatives not to pour water on the pyre or do anything=\r\n there without permissin from Manish. Finally at the end they came to Manis=\r\nh and=A0asked if they could pour some Ganges water. Manish said ok, but in =\r\na low voice told me nothing will happen to the fire, it won&#39;t die. They=\r\n poured a large mud kalash full of water but nothing happened to the fire. =\r\nIt kept burning. After some times, after some more ahutis, Manish called th=\r\ne people and said, &quot; Devi=A0samne khadi hai. App log pranam kijiye&quo=\r\nt;. At least 10/15 people came forward and reventially bowed to the fire. T=\r\nhen they wanted to touch=A0Manish&#39;s feet, but Manish would not let them=\r\n do so. They asked for his blessings. He distributed some flower petals we =\r\nhad and told them to go home, since it was very late in the night. Suddenly=\r\n the man, who had some doubts (whom Manish had\n addressed earlier) came run=\r\nning with tears in his eyes asking for forgiveness for having doubted. Mani=\r\nsh consoled him, told him nothing to worry, he has done no wrong, everythin=\r\ng is all right.=A0 Later Manish said, if it was some other time of the day =\r\nhe would have brought the man along for a cup of tea. Another person sudden=\r\nly came to Manish and asked him if he was a certain saint (a famous saint)=\r\n=A0who used to live in Kasi. Manish without responding to his query asked h=\r\nim where was he from, the person replied interior=A0Bihar. Manish advised h=\r\nim to go back home as it was late in the night. The faith of the ordinary p=\r\neople of this land is what makes India so unique, that is why our land and =\r\nculture is still so alive. We city bred &#39;educated&#39;=A0people are too=\r\n rational to understand these things. God loves the simple and uncalculatin=\r\ng. By this time I too stood up to do pranam to the fire. Immediately I felt=\r\n as if my body existed only from my\n head to my heart, there was nothing be=\r\nlow, no legs, no stomach ,=A0as if=A0I was simply floating on thin=A0air! I=\r\n told Manish what happened, he just gave a=A0curt one word reply, &quot;Goo=\r\nd&quot;.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;As we were=\r\n walking back from Manikarnika Manish suddenly said, &quot;There is a forei=\r\ngner lady who lives close to Manikarnika, who has a lot of desire to perfor=\r\nm sadhanas in the samshan but does not know how to go about it. I saw her w=\r\nhile meditating.&quot; For a woman to come and perform these sadhanas is pr=\r\nactically difficult or impossible, unless she is a Yogini or a sadhaka of g=\r\nreat calibre. Ordinary people would not be able to meet the gaze of a Yogin=\r\ni, said Manish. The next morning, when we came to the Lalita Ghat (as I men=\r\ntioned above), I saw a thin, frail, looking foreigner lady sitting on the b=\r\nanks. Manish quitely indicated to me that, that is the lady whom he had see=\r\nn last night in his meditation at the samshan. &quot;She has desire, but di=\r\nrectionless. &quot; At that time there was nothing more we could do. I gues=\r\ns that is why it is so important to keep doing some sadhana on your own, in=\r\nstead of merely contemplating which is of no good,=A0so that you are\n ready=\r\n when Nature decides to give you a push. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;After p=\r\nassing the Lalita Ghat, next afternoon,=A0we stood and observed Manikarnika=\r\n from a distance. We were dressed like any other tourist, specially with Ma=\r\nnish&#39;s camera hanging from his neck=A0and the=A0tripod. Manish smiled a=\r\nnd said let us not go too close to Manikarnika, what if the doms recognize =\r\nus! They would be shell shocked seeing us dressed as tourists, wondering wh=\r\nat is going on.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Thus ended my second day of obse=\r\nrving a Chandi homa on a funeral pyre at the famed Manikarnika Ghats of Kas=\r\nhi.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: =\r\n10pt; color: navy; font-family: Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;C=\r\nourier&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00007f&quot;&gt;Rama Naam Satya Hai&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;hr=\r\n size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;\nThe INTERNET now has a personality.
