Thanks for the messages of support. There \nis =\r\na lot of work to be done in this area. For example, Wendy Doniger, who is t=\r\nhe \nculprit behind a lot of negative misportrayals of Hindus and Hinduism (=\r\nas \ndescribed in the book) recently wrote a history of Hinduism book (thoug=\r\nh she \nadmits she is not a historian)=C2=A0that she is aiming to have be us=\r\ned as a standard \ntextbook in Indian schools in the high school levels (as =\r\nstated in the \nintroduction to the book). There have been some articles and=\r\n other reports \nwritten critiquing the book--for example, I wrote an articl=\r\ne in Outlook India \nrefuting her claim that Rama threw out Sita because he =\r\nwas afraid of becoming a \nsex addict like his father, Dasaratha, etc.--but =\r\nthere needs to be more of a \ncoordinated movement not only to refute such w=\r\nritings but to produce scholarly \nand objective descriptions of Hinduism th=\r\nat can replace the more bigoted / \ndenigratory writings. \n\n\nI am not really=\r\n into politics, but I can tell you from having been born and \nraised in Ame=\r\nrica, that the school envirionment (including at the very liberal \nschools =\r\nI attended) is poisoned for learning about Hinduism. The most \nfrustrating =\r\nthing for me as a young girl wanting to learn about Hinduism was the \nlack =\r\nof resources--I would go to the Hinduism shelf at the library or \nbookstore=\r\n=C2=A0only to find exposes on the &quot;cult of the Hare Krishnas&quot; or trashy \nbo=\r\noks on Tantric sex, or go read textbooks or other scholarly books on Hindui=\r\nsm \nat school only to be inundated with denouncements of caste and mockerie=\r\ns of the \nHindu pantheon as, at best, amusing mythology or, at worst, as a =\r\nmythology that \nreflected certain disturbing pathologies of the Indic peopl=\r\ne.\n\nHad I not the great fortune of finding my guru and other true acharyas =\r\nwho were \nable to provide me a correct understanding of Hinduism, I may hav=\r\ne eventually \ngiven up my search and lost out not only on knowing my herita=\r\nge but on finding \nthe path of sadhana.\n\nIt is for this reason that I think=\r\n this work is so important and urgent.\n\nMore information on these issues in=\r\n general is available at \nwww.invadingthesacred.com. I also have many extra=\r\n copies of the book. If you or \nsomeone you know would be interested, pleas=\r\ne let me know and I can arrange to \nhave copies shipped.

I finally got to \n&gt;read a little from i=\r\nt. I am impressed with this work.\n&gt;\n&gt;The book is called &quot;Invading the Sacre=\r\nd: An Analysis of Hinduism Studies in \n&gt;America&quot; (editors: Krishnan Ramaswa=\r\nmy, Antonio de Nicolas and Aditi Banerjee). \n&gt;It has 29 scholarly articles =\r\norganized in 4 sections.\n&gt;\n&gt;Perverted scholars with perverted anti-Hindu ag=\r\nendas that look down upon India \n&gt;and Hinduism with a colonial viewpoint ha=\r\nve conducted perverted researches in \n&gt;the name of academic freedom at the =\r\nreligious studies departments of western \n&gt;universities, published them and=\r\n gained name and fame, trampling the sacred in \n&gt;the process. Crying foul o=\r\nr getting frustrated with this will not improve the \n&gt;situation or solve th=\r\ne problem. Interested religious scholars have to firmly and \n&gt;patiently crt=\r\nique these works in the same academic style, in order to reclaim \n&gt;the righ=\r\ntful place for Hinduism.\n&gt;\n&gt;Several papers in this book do exactly that. Th=\r\ney take specific works by western \n&gt;scholars and rebut them quite well and =\r\nshow how they are fallacious, hasty, \n&gt;nonsensical or sometimes downright m=\r\nanipulative or filled with lies.\n&gt;\n&gt;* * *\n&gt;\n&gt;I will just give an example of=\r\n the offensive work that was rebutted in this \n&gt;book. [Warning: Those who a=\r\nre sensitive to offensive writings should skip the \n&gt;next three paragraphs.=\r\n]\n&gt;\n&gt;Jeffrey Kripal from Univ of Chicago visited Ramakrishna Mission in Wes=\r\nt Bengal \n&gt;and did research on Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Several people ther=\r\ne \n&gt;enthusiastically helped him in the researches. In the end, what he prod=\r\nuced is \n&gt;utterly nonsensical and filled with lies. He published his PhD di=\r\nssertation \n&gt;without showing it to Ramakrishna Mission people to check for =\r\nfactual or \n&gt;linguistic inaccuracies. Ramakrishna mission people found out =\r\nabout what he \n&gt;produced only years later, after his book &quot;Kali&#39;s Child&quot; ba=\r\nsed on the PhD \n&gt;dissertation won great acclaim in the West. He won an awar=\r\nd at the Americal \n&gt;Academy of Religion for that book, landed a job at Harv=\r\nard and his book was \n&gt;sadly mentioned in the Encyclopedia Britannica as th=\r\ne *number one* choice for \n&gt;learning about Ramakrishna.\n&gt;\n&gt;In the book, he =\r\nportrayed Ramakrishna as a sexually perverted person, a \n&gt;homosexual and a =\r\npedophile. He did not know Bengali or Hindi or Sanskrit well \n&gt;and did not =\r\ntake help from any Bengali people at the Mission for this work. He \n&gt;used h=\r\nis own faulty translations, willful distortions and manipulation of \n&gt;sourc=\r\nes to arrive at sensational (and damning) conclusions. For example, he \n&gt;tr=\r\nanslated a word that means &quot;lap&quot; as &quot;genitals&quot;, in the context of Swami \n&gt;B=\r\nrahmananda (spiritual son of Ramakrishna and a young boy then) sitting in \n=\r\n&gt;Ramakrishna&#39;s lap. He translated a word that means &quot;touching softly&quot; as \n&gt;=\r\n&quot;uncontrollably rubbing sandalpaste on the penises of boys&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt;Even in pla=\r\nces where there was no material to mis-translate, he simply \n&gt;speculated! F=\r\nor example, he speculated on the meeting of Totapuri and \n&gt;Ramakrishna, in =\r\nwhich the naaga sadhu (naked ascetic) Totapuri taught advaita \n&gt;vedanta to =\r\nRamakrishna and made him go beyond Mother Kali and experience \n&gt;nirvikalpa =\r\nsamadhi: &quot;What it must have been like for Ramakrishna, a homosexually \n&gt;ori=\r\nented man, to be shut away for days in a small hut with another, stark-nake=\r\nd \n&gt;man. Vedanta instruction or not, it was this man&#39;s nudity, and more esp=\r\necially, \n&gt;his penis, that normally caught Ramakrishna&#39;s attention. How cou=\r\nld it not?&quot; \n&gt;Please note that he is not referring to any source and mis-tr=\r\nanslating it, but \n&gt;simply speculating based on his perverted agenda!\n&gt;\n&gt;* =\r\n* *\n&gt;\n&gt;If you see the book, you will see many examples of such pseudo-schol=\r\narship \n&gt;driven by heinous agendas. It is a fact that many perverted people=\r\n under asuric \n&gt;influences make their livelihood, money and fame lying and =\r\nspreading falsehoods \n&gt;about Hinduism, Hindu deities and Hindu saints.\n&gt;\n&gt;T=\r\nhose who are not inclined to fight a dharma yuddha against this may ignore =\r\nthis \n&gt;and go on doing their sadhana. After all, if enough people do sadhan=\r\na to \n&gt;strengthen sanatana dharma, this kind of things will automatically w=\r\neaken. \n&gt;However, some scholars engaging these pseudo-scholars academically=\r\n is really \n&gt;required on the ground. We need to give our encouragement to t=\r\nhe pioneers who \n&gt;are doing this important scholarly rebuttal.\n&gt;\n&gt;Best rega=\r\nrds,\n&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt;=\r\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;Films that make a difference: http://Saraswat=\r\niFilms.org\n&gt;Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;Jyoti=\r\nsh writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;---------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-837472538-1286803479=:92030\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;=\r\nfont-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Aditi,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;Deepest appreciation&nbsp;for the work that you have done.

We a=\r\nre trying to provide copies to temples and local libraries so that it is th=\r\nere as a resource for those who are interested. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;Warm regards,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Aditi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV clas=\r\ns=3Dgmail_quote&gt;On Mon, Oct 11, 2010 at 4:49 AM, Se Am &lt;SPAN dir=3Dltr&gt;&lt;=\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:mahalaxmyey@...&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow yma=\r\nilto=3D&quot;mailto:mahalaxmyey@...&quot;&gt;mahalaxmyey@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; =\r\nwrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE class=3Dgmail_quote style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #ccc 1px s=\r\nolid&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND-COLOR: #fff&quot;&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roma=\r\nn, new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;iam wondering how to give encouragement to=\r\n the pioneers who are doing this important scholarly rebuttal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 14pt; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times,=\r\n serif&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px=\r\n solid; FONT-FAMILY: times new roman, new york, times, serif&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D=\r\nTahoma size=3D2&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\n&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/=\r\nSPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:pvr@...&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:pvr@...&quot;&gt;pvr@...=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;=\r\nmailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; Mon, October 11, 20=\r\n10 8:37:26 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/B&gt; [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] &quot;Invading the Sacred&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nSPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A member of this group=\r\n gifted me a book when he met me for a saamoohika Satya Narayana vratam we =\r\nconducted at Cary, North Carolina last year. I finally got to read a little=\r\n from it. I am impressed with this work.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The book is called &quot;Invadin=\r\ng the Sacred: An Analysis of Hinduism Studies in America&quot; (editors: Krishna=\r\nn Ramaswamy, Antonio de Nicolas and Aditi Banerjee). It has 29 scholarly ar=\r\nticles organized in 4 sections.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Perverted scholars with perverted an=\r\nti-Hindu agendas that look down upon India and Hinduism with a colonial vie=\r\nwpoint have conducted perverted researches in the name of academic freedom =\r\nat the religious studies departments of western universities, published the=\r\nm and gained name and fame, trampling the sacred in the process. Crying fou=\r\nl or getting frustrated with this will not improve the situation or solve t=\r\nhe problem. Interested religious scholars have to firmly and patiently crti=\r\nque these works in\n the same academic style, in order to reclaim the rightf=\r\nul place for Hinduism.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Several papers in this book do exactly that. =\r\nThey take specific works by western scholars and rebut them quite well and =\r\nshow how they are fallacious, hasty, nonsensical or sometimes downright man=\r\nipulative or filled with lies.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I will just give an exam=\r\nple of the offensive work that was rebutted in this book. [Warning: Those w=\r\nho are sensitive to offensive writings should skip the next three paragraph=\r\ns.]&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jeffrey Kripal from Univ of Chicago visited Ramakrishna Mission =\r\nin West Bengal and did research on Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. Several people =\r\nthere enthusiastically helped him in the researches. In the end, what he pr=\r\noduced is utterly nonsensical and filled with lies. He published his PhD di=\r\nssertation without showing it to Ramakrishna Mission people to check for fa=\r\nctual or linguistic inaccuracies. Ramakrishna mission people found out abou=\r\nt what he\n produced only years later, after his book &quot;Kali&#39;s Child&quot; based o=\r\nn the PhD dissertation won great acclaim in the West. He won an award at th=\r\ne Americal Academy of Religion for that book, landed a job at Harvard and h=\r\nis book was sadly mentioned in the Encyclopedia Britannica as the *number o=\r\nne* choice for learning about Ramakrishna.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the book, he portrayed=\r\n Ramakrishna as a sexually perverted person, a homosexual and a pedophile. =\r\nHe did not know Bengali or Hindi or Sanskrit well and did not take help fro=\r\nm any Bengali people at the Mission for this work. He used his own faulty t=\r\nranslations, willful distortions and manipulation of sources to arrive at s=\r\nensational (and damning) conclusions. For example, he translated a word tha=\r\nt means &quot;lap&quot; as &quot;genitals&quot;, in the context of Swami Brahmananda (spiritual=\r\n son of Ramakrishna and a young boy then) sitting in Ramakrishna&#39;s lap. He =\r\ntranslated a word that means &quot;touching softly&quot; as &quot;uncontrollably rubbing\n =\r\nsandalpaste on the penises of boys&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even in places where there was =\r\nno material to mis-translate, he simply speculated! For example, he specula=\r\nted on the meeting of Totapuri and Ramakrishna, in which the naaga sadhu (n=\r\naked ascetic) Totapuri taught advaita vedanta to Ramakrishna and made him g=\r\no beyond Mother Kali and experience nirvikalpa samadhi: &quot;What it must have =\r\nbeen like for Ramakrishna, a homosexually oriented man, to be shut away for=\r\n days in a small hut with another, stark-naked man. Vedanta instruction or =\r\nnot, it was this man&#39;s nudity, and more especially, his penis, that normall=\r\ny caught Ramakrishna&#39;s attention. How could it not?&quot; Please note that he is=\r\n not referring to any source and mis-translating it, but simply speculating=\r\n based on his perverted agenda!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you see the book, yo=\r\nu will see many examples of such pseudo-scholarship driven by heinous agend=\r\nas. It is a fact that many perverted people under asuric influences\n make t=\r\nheir livelihood, money and fame lying and spreading falsehoods about Hindui=\r\nsm, Hindu deities and Hindu saints.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Those who are not inclined to fi=\r\nght a dharma yuddha against this may ignore this and go on doing their sadh=\r\nana. After all, if enough people do sadhana to strengthen sanatana dharma, =\r\nthis kind of things will automatically weaken. However, some scholars engag=\r\ning these pseudo-scholars academically is really required on the ground. We=\r\n need to give our encouragement to the pioneers who are doing this importan=\r\nt scholarly rebuttal.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;----------------=\r\n------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free J=\r\nyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,&lt;BR&gt;Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot;
