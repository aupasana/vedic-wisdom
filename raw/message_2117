If you are not s=\r\npecific, you can just visualize any form you may want. However, for the wor=\r\nship to be more effective, Rishis have provided Dhyanam followed by the par=\r\nticular mantra of that form, to help us visualize and concentrate better.\n\n=\r\nRegards\nNarayan\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiy=\r\najiten@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks to all\n&gt; One more question\n&gt; When we are doin=\r\ng the homam which form of Ganpati are praying to because recently i saw tha=\r\nt are various forms of Ganpati.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Jitender\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;naaraayana_iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nama=\r\nste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1)While doing homam can we move the coconut pieces tha=\r\nt are there in the havan kund, so that they get burned easily.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i aske=\r\nd it becoz would it be right to poke in the fire with a stick while we are =\r\nactually assuming Ganpati is in that fire and the idol at that time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes. You can move the coconut pieces anywhere to facilitate their=\r\n burning.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2)Almost every time some pieces are left  unburnt, so =\r\ni do not remove the remains from the kund and next time use it as it is and=\r\n add fresh pieces of coconut.Is it fine??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yes.
