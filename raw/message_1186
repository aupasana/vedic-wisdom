I did not pay much attention then but\nreally I felt ba=\r\nd the next few days to the point that I regret going \nthere. At a minimum I=\r\n did not go there to get robbed.\n\nAnyways my question is how does one make =\r\nsure that he/she does not \nexperiance this again in future. I believe it is=\r\n very important for all \nof us to not go through similar experiance. Are th=\r\nere any precautions, \none can take? Any special mantras to protect one self=\r\n?\n\nHave other experianced this?\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n\n"}}
