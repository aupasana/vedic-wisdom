I am posting the=\r\n excerpts below:\n\n[\nBlessed are those whose intentions are pure, and those =\r\nwho come to Mata, are blessed irrespective of anything. This is most import=\r\nant, even if someone is not able to win over all the shadripus and falters =\r\nfor a while, but repents later on and pleads to Mother for Her love, grace =\r\nand blessings, he is blessed. Maa treats her devotees really like her child=\r\nren and pardons all follies. Not only this, Jagadamba blesses everyone to g=\r\net whatever they want, be it laukika or alaukika.\nSo blessed you stand.\nCha=\r\nndi Patha is always beneficial, but it is extremely potent to be done durin=\r\ng navrattras. The Sharadiya and Vasantik Navarattra are common knowledge, b=\r\nut there are two gupt Navrattras, thereby making 4 per year, 3 months apart=\r\n each. Patha with sankalpa is certain to give tangible results.\nOne more se=\r\ncret, if you are able to do it in a siddha temple of Mata, results are more=\r\n pronounced. If you visit any of the 51/52 SHAKTI-PEETHAs during navrattris=\r\n for darshan, Phala of 1 Chandi-patha is immediately condescended upon you =\r\nas soon as you have darshan. A patha in Shakti-Peetha during Navratri gives=\r\n result of 108 pathas.\nAnd these are not just exaggerated sayings or belief=\r\ns, these are verified by Siddhas.\nBest Wishes,\n]\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--=\r\n- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;priyank_priyank&quot; &lt;aks_day@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Namaste all, \n&gt; \n&gt; June 20 onwards (from tomm) is Gupta Navratri. so let=\r\ns get in high gear. \n&gt; \n&gt; Some say there are 4 navratris in a year, some sa=\r\ny 6, wikipedia says 5. I dont know, if someone knows do enlighten us.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nregards\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
