The sea rushed into the city. It\ncoursed throug=\r\nh the streets of the beautiful city. The sea covered up\neverything in the c=\r\nity. Arjuna saw the beautiful buildings becoming\nsubmerged one by one. He t=\r\nook a last look at the mansion of Krishna. In a\nmatter of a few moments it =\r\nwas all over. The sea had now become as placid as\na lake. There was no trac=\r\ne of the beautiful city, which had been the\nfavourite haunt of all the Pand=\r\navas. Dwarka was just a name; just a memory.&quot;\n=96 Mausala Parva, Mahabharat=\r\na.*\n\nDoes this account from the ancient Indian epic have a true historical =\r\ncore?\nDid Lord Krishna, indeed the favourite Indian deity, walk the streets=\r\n of\nancient Dwarka? Did Krishna, considered the Lord of the universe by a\nb=\r\nillion Hindus, rule the Yaduvanshi clan thousands of years ago?\n\nUsing arch=\r\naeological, scriptural, literary and astronomical data, scholars\nand scient=\r\nists are coming round to the view that Krishna was definitely a\nhistorical =\r\ncharacter.\n\n*ARCHAEOLOGICAL EVIDENCE*\n\nThe Rosetta stone, or the key, to th=\r\ne Krishna story is Dwarka. The strongest\narchaeological support comes from =\r\nthe structures discovered in the late\n1980s under the seabed off the coast =\r\nof modern Dwarka in Gujarat by a team\nof archaeologists and divers led by D=\r\nr S.R. Rao, one of India&#39;s most\nrespected archaeologists. An emeritus scien=\r\ntist at the marine archaeology\nunit of the National Institute of Oceanograp=\r\nhy, Goa, Rao has excavated a\nlarge number of Harappan sites, including the =\r\nport city of Lothal in\nGujarat.\n\nIn his book The Lost City of Dwarka, publi=\r\nshed in 1999, he writes about his\nundersea finds: =93The discovery is an im=\r\nportant landmark in the history of\nIndia. It has set to rest the doubts exp=\r\nressed by historians about the\nhistoricity of Mahabharata and the very exis=\r\ntence of Dwarka city.=94\n\nConducting 12 expeditions during 1983-1990, Rao i=\r\ndentified two underwater\nsettlements, one near the present-day Dwarka and t=\r\nhe other in the nearby\nisland of Bet Dwarka. This tallies with the two Dwar=\r\nkas mentioned in the\nepic. The underwater expeditions won Rao the first Wor=\r\nld Ship Trust Award\nfor Individual Achievement.\n\nAnother important find by =\r\nour divers was a seal that establishes the\nsubmerged township&#39;s connection =\r\nwith the Dwarka of the Mahabharata. The seal\ncorroborates the reference mad=\r\ne in the ancient text, the Harivamsa, that\nevery citizen of Dwarka should c=\r\narry such a seal for identification\npurposes. Krishna had ruled that none w=\r\nithout the seal should enter it. A\nsimilar seal has been found onshore as w=\r\nell.\n\nRead more\nhttp://www.indianweekender.co.nz/Pages/ArticleDetails/51/14=\r\n21/Comment/How-science-discovered-the-historical-Krishna\n\n-- \nHave a Fulfil=\r\nling Day\n\nVenkat\n\nThanks & Regards\nE-Gurukul Team\n\nwww.e-gurukul.net\nAncien=\r\nt Practical Knowledge and Wisdom for New Age\n\n&quot;Aano Bhadrah Kritawo Yantu V=\r\nishwataha  - Rigveda 1-89-i\nMeaning -Let Noble Thoughts come to us from all=\r\n sides&quot;\n\r\n--0015174c35441e221a048f313933\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nDear all&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Happy Janmastami to one and all :)&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Pleas find article on &quot;=A0How science discovered the hist=\r\norical Krishna&quot; by Rakesh Krishnan.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif;=\r\n font-size: 12px; line-height: 18px; word-spacing: 1px; &quot;&gt;&lt;p style=3D&quot;paddi=\r\nng-top: 0px; padding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; ma=\r\nrgin-top: 0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 14px; margin-left: 0px; fo=\r\nnt-family: Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif; &quot;&gt;\n&lt;em style=3D&quot;padding-top: 0px; =\r\npadding-right: 0px; padding-bottom: 0px; padding-left: 0px; margin-top: 0px=\r\n; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; &quot;&gt;The sea, which=\r\n had been beating against the shores, suddenly broke the boundary that was =\r\nimposed on it by nature.
