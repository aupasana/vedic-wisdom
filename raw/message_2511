I have been an ardent devotee of Goddess Mahalaks=\r\nhmi for a long time. On the second day itself I felt the presence of the di=\r\nety in the kund. I don&#39;t know if it is my imagination but at the same time =\r\nI also see sudden bad events happening to me. Should I consider it a good s=\r\nign? Is God testing me or is it my karma? Kindly guide.\n\nThanks,\n\nSudha\n\n\n"}}
