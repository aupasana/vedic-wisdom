This is regarding Swami Brahmanand=\r\na. I was \n&gt; reading a book on his life and various incidents connected to h=\r\nim \n&gt; observed by other saints and his brother disciples.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Brahma=\r\nnanda or Rakhal Maharaj was the spiritual son of \nThakur. \n&gt; And no doubt a=\r\n great spiritual super giant. Thakur used to say he \n&gt; was one of Sri Krish=\r\nna&#39;s eternal playmates who had reincarnated on \n&gt; this plane.\n&gt; \n&gt; During h=\r\nis stay in various monastaries of the Ramakrishna Mission, \n&gt; often other m=\r\nonks used to send new initiates to Rakhal Maharaj for \n&gt; hios blessings. It=\r\n was a generally accepted idea among the \ndisciples \n&gt; of Thakur that any o=\r\nne who is blessed by Rakhal Maharaj will never \n&gt; again be troubled by prob=\r\nlems of lack of Brahmacharya. \n&gt; \n&gt; One day an individual came to Rakhal Ma=\r\nharaj asking for his \n&gt; blessings and said &quot;Maharaj, please give me brahmac=\r\nharya as a \n&gt; blessing&quot;. Hearing this suddenly Rakhal Maharaj said, &quot;Why do=\r\n you \n&gt; people always come asking for Brahmacharya? Was does not any one \n&gt;=\r\n come to me asking me to give him/her God? Isn&#39;t God the final aim \nof \n&gt; e=\r\nverything.. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it possible for someone who cannot maintain brahmacha=\r\nrya to \nreach \n&gt; God?

Someone \n&gt; &gt; else may have to first overcome his lus=\r\nt even to have a vision \nof \n&gt; the deity. \n&gt; &gt; What is good for goose is no=\r\nt good for gander. In general, it is \n&gt; good to try \n&gt; &gt; to overcome lust i=\r\nf it is possible.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Several &quot;normal college going people&quot; were taken=\r\n under his wings \n&gt; by \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and transformed into sp=\r\niritual giants. \n&gt; Swami \n&gt; &gt; Vivekananda, Swami Brahmananda, Swami Yoganan=\r\nda etc were college \n&gt; students \n&gt; &gt; when they met Ramakrishna.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bu=\r\nt it is not easy to overcome lust at all. Several of \n&gt; Ramakrishna&#39; s \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n disciples also struggled with it initially and overcame lust \nwith \n&gt; his =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; blessings. Lust is a very basic human instinct and not at all \neasy \n&gt;=\r\n to kill \n&gt; &gt; completely.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the beginning, it is ok if the though=\r\nt does not go out of the \n&gt; mind. Set a \n&gt; &gt; rule for 20 days or 40 days or=\r\n 108 days or some period like that \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; maintain physical brahmachar=\r\nya. Don&#39;t worry if thoughts come.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and=\r\n it does not help in overcoming \n&gt; the basic \n&gt; &gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-bu=\r\nrdened by it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important =\r\nthing is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove them from the root\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nTrue, suppressing desire will make the desire come back later. \n&gt; But, if o=\r\nne \n&gt; &gt; keeps fulfilling desires, they never end!! This is the nature \nof \n=\r\n&gt; desire. \n&gt; &gt; Whether one desires money or knowledge (of anything other th=\r\nan \n&gt; Self) or \n&gt; &gt; physical pleasures, the desire will never end no matter=\r\n how much \n&gt; one gets.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Removing desire from the root often require=\r\ns suppressing the \n&gt; desire \n&gt; &gt; temporarily. But the thing to remember fro=\r\nm the Aghora book is \n&gt; that just \n&gt; &gt; suppressing desire is not sufficient=\r\n. Practice suppressing \n&gt; desires, but do \n&gt; &gt; remember that the final goal=\r\n is to uproot it fully and keep \n&gt; working on it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The only reaso=\r\nn for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took suc=\r\nh a long time probasbly i can also do it , \nif\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 years at leas=\r\nt in 10-12 years\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is the right spirit!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Spiritual prog=\r\nress involves a lot of things and brahmacharya is \n&gt; one thing. \n&gt; &gt; The mo=\r\nst fundamental thing is to overcome ego and not become \n&gt; attached to \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nthings. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions and possessions \nand \n&gt; &gt; de=\r\nveloping a sense of surrender is the most fundamental thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There=\r\n are several things in spiritual progress. They all come \n&gt; together! One \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; person may develop detachment to actions and possessions and \n&gt; brahmac=\r\nharya \n&gt; &gt; may become easy as a result. One person may achieve brahmacharya=\r\n \n&gt; first and \n&gt; &gt; detachment may become easy as a result and come later. V=\r\narious \n&gt; signs of \n&gt; &gt; spiritual progress come almost together, but the ex=\r\nact order can \n&gt; change from \n&gt; &gt; person to person. Thus, do not be disappo=\r\ninted by your inability \n&gt; to get \n&gt; &gt; something. It may be possible to wor=\r\nk it out from another angle!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -----=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n-\n&gt; &gt; Do a Shor=\r\nt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpa=\r\nnas Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3)=\r\n: http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows):=\r\n http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: ht=\r\ntp://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- -\n- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; Namaste =\r\nsir\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i know you are lot busy but since i couldn;t ask this question=\r\n \non a\n&gt; &gt; public forum as it may probably offend others.\n&gt; &gt; If you have t=\r\nime ,if you could please reply.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I was thinking this for many days\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; that as mentioned in recent thread on brahamcharya,\n&gt; &gt; it was importan=\r\nt to maintain brahamcharya but i wanted to ask \nthat\n&gt; &gt; even vimalananda h=\r\nad to work for 6 years for overcoming lust \nthough\n&gt; &gt; he had his deity wit=\r\nh him from the very early in life.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; how can normal college going pe=\r\nople like me who don&#39;t even have a\n&gt; &gt; deity obtain this goal.\n&gt; &gt; Though i=\r\n try to maintain physical brahamcharya for few months but\n&gt; &gt; after that i =\r\nam not able to hold it ,\n&gt; &gt; and even if i maintain some physical chastity =\r\nit refuses to go \nout\n&gt; &gt; of mind\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA =\r\nwas the important thing is not\n&gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove them from th=\r\ne root\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, how can i finish it completely from my mind\n&gt; &gt; Though =\r\ni have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on Practice of \n&gt; Brahamcharya\n&gt; &gt; but i=\r\n don&#39;t think i have made any spiritual progress in maintaing\n&gt; &gt; Brahamchar=\r\nya\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and sometimes it makes me guilt ridden.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The only reaso=\r\nn for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if\n&gt; &gt; vimalananda took such =\r\na long time probasbly i can also do it , if\n&gt; &gt; not in 6 years at least in =\r\n10-12 years\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; you can also reply on VEDIC WISDOM group but if you ca=\r\nn remove my\n&gt; &gt; identity from this that would be appreciable\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; if wh=\r\nat i worte offended you please delete this mail\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; &lt;delet=\r\ned&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      Add more friends to your messenger and enj=\r\noy!

I am puzzled...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:ved=\r\nic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ y=\r\nahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Someone &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; else may have to first=\r\n overcome his lust even to have a vision &lt;BR&gt;of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the deity. &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; What is good for goose is not good for gander. In general, it is &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; good to try &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to overcome lust if it is possible.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Several &quot;normal college going people&quot; were taken under =\r\nhis wings &lt;BR&gt;&gt; by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and transformed=\r\n into spiritual giants. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Swami &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Vivekananda, Swami Bra=\r\nhmananda, Swami Yogananda etc were college &lt;BR&gt;&gt; students &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nwhen they met Ramakrishna.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But it is not easy to=\r\n overcome lust at all. Several of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna&#39; s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; dis=\r\nciples also struggled\n with it initially and overcame lust &lt;BR&gt;with &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; blessings. Lust is a very basic human instinct and not =\r\nat all &lt;BR&gt;easy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to kill &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; completely.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In the beginning, it is ok if the thought does not go out of the=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind. Set a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rule for 20 days or 40 days or 108 days=\r\n or some period like that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; maintain physical brah=\r\nmacharya. Don&#39;t worry if thoughts come.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Feeling =\r\nof guilt is a weight and it does not help in overcoming &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the basic =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important thing is not&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove them from the root&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; True, suppressing desire will make the desire come back late=\r\nr. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But, if one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; keeps fulfilling desires, they never =\r\nend!! This is\n the nature &lt;BR&gt;of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; desire. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Whether one=\r\n desires money or knowledge (of anything other than &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Self) or &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; physical pleasures, the desire will never end no matter how much &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; one gets.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Removing desire from the root =\r\noften requires suppressing the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; desire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; temporarily. B=\r\nut the thing to remember from the Aghora book is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that just &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; suppressing desire is not sufficient. Practice suppressing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ndesires, but do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; remember that the final goal is to uproot it =\r\nfully and keep &lt;BR&gt;&gt; working on it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nonly reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can also do it , &lt;BR&gt;if&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; That is the right spirit!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spiritual progre=\r\nss\n involves a lot of things and brahmacharya is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one thing. &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; The most fundamental thing is to overcome ego and not become &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; attached to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; things. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions=\r\n and possessions &lt;BR&gt;and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; developing a sense of surrender is t=\r\nhe most fundamental thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There are several thi=\r\nngs in spiritual progress. They all come &lt;BR&gt;&gt; together! One &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; person may develop detachment to actions and possessions and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; br=\r\nahmacharya &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; may become easy as a result. One person may achiev=\r\ne brahmacharya &lt;BR&gt;&gt; first and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; detachment may become easy =\r\nas a result and come later. Various &lt;BR&gt;&gt; signs of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; spiritu=\r\nal progress come almost together, but the exact order can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; change f=\r\nrom &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; person to person. Thus, do not be disappointed by your in=\r\nability &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; something. It may be possible to\n wor=\r\nk it out from another angle!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas You=\r\nrself: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_bla=\r\nnk rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comca=\r\nst. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicA=\r\nst\n rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://ww=\r\nw.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original =\r\nMessage ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste sir&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; i know y=\r\nou are lot busy but since i couldn;t ask this question &lt;BR&gt;on a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; public forum as it may probably offend others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; If you have t=\r\nime ,if you could please reply.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I was thinking t=\r\nhis for many days&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that as mentioned in recent thread on braham=\r\ncharya,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it was important to maintain brahamcharya but i wanted=\r\n to ask &lt;BR&gt;that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; even vimalananda had to work for 6 years for =\r\novercoming lust &lt;BR&gt;though&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; he had his deity with him from the =\r\nvery early in life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; how can normal college going=\r\n\n people like me who don&#39;t even have a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; deity obtain this goal.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though i try to maintain physical brahamcharya for few months=\r\n but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; after that i am not able to hold it ,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and ev=\r\nen if i maintain some physical chastity it refuses to go &lt;BR&gt;out&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; of mind&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was t=\r\nhe important thing is not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove them fro=\r\nm the root&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; So, how can i finish it completely fr=\r\nom my mind&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though i have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on Practi=\r\nce of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Brahamcharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; but i don&#39;t think i have made any =\r\nspiritual progress in maintaing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Brahamcharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; and sometimes it makes me guilt ridden.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can also do it ,\n if&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; y=\r\nou can also reply on VEDIC WISDOM group but if you can remove my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; identity from this that would be appreciable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nif what i worte offended you please delete this mail&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;deleted&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1=\r\n&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; Connect with friends all over the world. &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://in.rd.yah=\r\noo.com/tagline_messenger_1/*http://in.messenger.yahoo.com/?wm=3Dn/&quot;&gt; Get Ya=\r\nhoo!
