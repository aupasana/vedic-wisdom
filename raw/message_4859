People do offer tamarind rice, lemon rice etc also in homam these days.\n \nBased on strict ancient rules, however, only saattwik food is offered in homam. All raajasik and taamasik substances are kept away. Salty, sour and spicy substances (e.g. lemon, tamarind, salt, chillies, black pepper etc) are avoided in homam fire in strict tradition, even as part of a food preparation. In other words, only foods that do not have any salt, pepper, chillies, lemon, tamarind etc are offered in fire. Payasam (sweet pudding made of rice/sabudana/wheat semiya) is fine, but tamarind rice is not. Some people still follow this strict tradition.\n \nHowever, the currently popular tradition is to allow those things and avoid only specific rajasik/taamasik substances like onion, garlic, eggs and meat. Follow this tradition if it is convenient. If possible (and if you are inclined), you may follow the strict rules and stick to sweet and creamy substances only.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Sri Narasimha garu,\n&gt; \n&gt; Can we offer in homam the various flowers and leafs that we get in India during \n&gt; Vinayaka chavithi?
