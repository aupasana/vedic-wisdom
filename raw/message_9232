I want to be able to finish dinner by 20=\r\n:00 but the sunset is at 20:23. In the mornings I am up early but need time=\r\n for my yoga routine etc, so 6:00 is out of the question.\n\nMay be our ances=\r\ntors had thought of all such worldly limitations and that is why they inclu=\r\nded a short verse for prayaschitta in the sandhyavandanam procedure itself.=\r\n This would help me do Sandhyavandanam EVERYDAY, at least once a day.\n\nIs i=\r\nt justified to routinely use this (not as an exception)?\n\n\n\n\n"}}
