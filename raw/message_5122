The web of initiation-in-name-only,\nsAd=\r\nhana, and true-initiation are described there in allegorical terms.\nThis ap=\r\npears, to me, to be yet another story chock full of meaning.\n\nThe english t=\r\nranslation of the story is available here --\nhttp://rajunaryanaswamy.blogsp=\r\not.com/2010/07/maharishi-valmiki.html\nThere are many variations of the stor=\r\ny. If any of you can share the\ndetails of the &quot;original&quot; story, and where t=\r\no find it (ramayana,\nmahabharata, puranas), I would appreciate it.\n\nbhavadi=\r\niyaH,\n\n      ajit\n\n\n&gt; (2a) As in the analogy I gave earlier, a rich father =\r\nmay open a bank account in a son&#39;s name with a starting balance of one mill=\r\nion dollars. Similarly, a guru with some achievement in a mantra can transf=\r\ner some of it to a disciple. However, one without a rich father is still be=\r\ntter off opening a bank account with a zero balance and building it up slow=\r\nly with one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do=\r\n sadhana with famous mantras and build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you =\r\nfind a guru to initiate you (not as a formality, but truly initiate you), g=\r\net initiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do it.\n\n"}}
