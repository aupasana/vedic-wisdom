I do not=\r\n know if `Dry Intellect&#39; (The one without a certain level of Realization) c=\r\nan ever break the code of the karma software.\n\nI would think of responding =\r\nto our one query filtering it from all those interconnected and too complic=\r\nated queries.\n\n&gt;And how does one know the fine line between paying debt and=\r\n &gt;creating a new one?\n\nConsider this real life example.\n\nTake a case study =\r\n- Mr. Fool (FL) Landed some Amount of Money to Mr. &#39;Very smart&#39;(VS) on basi=\r\ns of trust and for a pious cause. Now it happened so that Mr. VS could not =\r\nrepay it due to reasons only known to him. Mr. VS gives many excuses and ma=\r\nny dates but fails and ultimately does not pay back. Mr. FL is under great =\r\npressure due to that.\n \nMr. FL can have many options to react in the situat=\r\nions:\n\n1] Thinking constantly and repenting for the act He can-\n   Curse, C=\r\nonstantly follow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain under stress, resort to other tec=\r\nhniques of &#39;Vasuli&#39; and resorts to many Internal and external activities co=\r\nncerning that issue.\n\nIn this case, He strongly identifies with the Money, =\r\nact of Giving then expecting it back, Repenting etc...\n\nOR\n\n2] Mr. FL can r=\r\neally grab the golden chance to resort to the implementation of knowledge (=\r\nKIP-Knowledge in Practice) and thinks that it was a Rina which needed to be=\r\n paid back and practically starts training the mind with that knowledge. He=\r\n follows up for the money but with the attitude of detachment. Although he =\r\nshows to his family and friends that he is extremely concerned and it was f=\r\noolish act etc... But in his mind he thinks that it was a rina from some pa=\r\nst life which was fulfilled. He thinks that they were Money of Mother and s=\r\nhe will take care. If they needed to come back, she will do it or if they w=\r\nere to be paid to nullify some past rinas then they will not come back.\n\nWi=\r\nth the Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas and will =\r\nbe able to break free from this particular chain. He may have successfully =\r\nPAID BACK his debt.\n\nWith the first Approach, Mr. FL has identified himself=\r\n very strongly with Money and its ownership and hence all the actions done =\r\ndue to that, so He may have created NEW RINAS which will be needed to settl=\r\ned on a later date.\n\nHowever I am not sure for what I have written. I think=\r\n nobody can be sure.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal  \n   \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n I have a few basic queries. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; What is the line between control a=\r\nnd gratification?

This friend may get interested in the book and stop distracting =\r\nyou, or he may continue to distract you and make it worse by being right ne=\r\nxt to you through the reading.

It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names of Lor=\r\nd Shiva is Aghora. A true=C2=A0Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as ter=\r\nrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestations of god an=\r\nd tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (god) always=\r\n, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; When someone die=\r\ns, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while carrying the dead body =\r\nto the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama is true and everything=\r\n else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself that life and death ar=\r\ne just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real. But the question is:=\r\n why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth only when someone di=\r\nes? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thing we have done and w=\r\ne are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam sa=\r\ntya hai. This thing we did and the praises are temporary illusions. Only th=\r\ne Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;? When we fee=\r\nl attracted to something beautiful and want to get it, can&#39;t we tell oursel=\r\nves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems beautiful and other things=\r\n that seem not so beautiful are temporary illusions.

These abuses are temporary illusions. Only the Lord =\r\nis real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; A true=\r\n Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. His mind rejects all *=\r\nimpermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on them by class=\r\nifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking about them wi=\r\nth attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what is permanent. =\r\nBut he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Vedanta =\r\nsays &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursu=\r\nes it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant illusions and th=\r\ne only permanent reality within them is the Self, he questions why he can e=\r\nat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces is eaten.=C2=A0B=\r\nut, please remember that eating feces is not the main point. Perceiving Sel=\r\nf in the food being consumed and not perceiving an impermanent manifestatio=\r\nn of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For example, eating feces =\r\nwith disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s mind is dwelling on the=\r\n impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A successful =\r\nAghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling on the fact t=\r\nhat he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and will not feel any kind=\r\n of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and he is eating Self.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions really. He chants =\r\nvedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am c=\r\nonsuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not =\r\nbe fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the =\r\nimpermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinja=\r\nl curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the per=\r\nmanent (Self).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themse=\r\nlves the same truth and trying to absorb that truth into every thought and =\r\nimpulse. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation where failur=\r\ne results in a very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incent=\r\nive in forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants=\r\n a Vedic verse that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty=\r\n laddus and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind i=\r\nn Self while eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even=\r\n not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the =\r\nother hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of =\r\nfeces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a v=\r\nery bad dual experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by eve=\r\nryone merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas s=\r\nucceeds.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Take another simple examp=\r\nle.

Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getti=\r\nng sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and b=\r\nlocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; A regular person will try to enforce celi=\r\nbacy and keep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula=\r\n for overcoming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and =\r\ndistract one. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarante=\r\ne that the fascination in the mind does not return to bite one after that. =\r\nBut, how to overcome the fascination some minds may have for sex?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause a=\r\nnd remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as =\r\ntwo different activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combine th=\r\nem into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora =\r\nsits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his japa=\r\nm. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think tha=\r\nt his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam li=\r\nke that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He =\r\nmay no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no longer feel=\r\n titillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex may be =\r\nbroken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no longer evo=\r\nke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts re=\r\nlated to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to denser and\n&gt;  d=\r\nenser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but they may now=\r\n take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much time in meditatio=\r\nn while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind may feel f=\r\nor nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s fascinat=\r\nion and weakness for sex may be gone largely.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Mind has a lot of =\r\nconditioning based on prior experiences and the thoughts we are exposed to.=\r\n Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of these structures by engaging =\r\nin certain practices that undermine those structures.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; However, i=\r\ns this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible that the person=\r\n keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex everyti=\r\nme he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he s=\r\nees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0Bottomline is that an aghora takes probl=\r\nems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, where=\r\nas a normal person may push the problems under the carpet and fight slowly =\r\nand with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is not applicable to all.\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what i=\r\ns Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to understa=\r\nnd and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stakes=\r\n war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may feel =\r\naversion. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it based on=\r\n a wrong understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.=C2=A0Ag=\r\nhora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract som=\r\ne people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and=\r\n Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one a=\r\nbsorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasant.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual=\r\n paths and explains the basic reality.

For=C2=A0instance, Sri Muththuswam=\r\ny Diskshitar, was a great composer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic M=\r\nusic along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri =\r\nVidyopasaka.

Anyway, your reply was a great one in which you mentioned how t=\r\nhe Self is surrounded by layers of duality! I never thought in those terms.=\r\n \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I have started reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise =\r\nof reading it fluently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I plan to =\r\ndo during navaratri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get comfortable readin=\r\ng the saptashati! Have to see how mother will help me achieve my target. \n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; Also, I have started to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Rober=\r\nt Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings on the subject.

My performing a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-insp=\r\niring. On the other hand, there are some people who do not know Sanskrit at=\r\n all and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great difficulty in their fir=\r\nst attempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hour=\r\ns now. THAT is awe-inspiring.\n&gt; \n&gt; Integrating various sadhanas is a person=\r\nal problem that needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea to=\r\n pick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead of s=\r\nplitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it i=\r\ns better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten pla=\r\nces, if one wants to find water.\n&gt; \n&gt; One possibility is to do a homam and =\r\nthen meditate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is atta=\r\nched to.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, from th=\r\ne little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic representation of=\r\n the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unravel th=\r\ne layer of duality and realize Self.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lalita means gentle one and Chand=\r\ni means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teaches you gently, you wi=\r\nll learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern and strict, you will lea=\r\nrn fast (provided you can face the strictness).

You al=\r\nso wrote that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homa=\r\nm. How can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? A=\r\nlso, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapat=\r\nhi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachak=\r\nshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minute=\r\ns daily ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals several times a week, t=\r\nhat takes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along with ho=\r\nmam? Is Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Could you please expla=\r\nin what is sri Vidya and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to lea=\r\nrn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in S=\r\nri Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna krith=\r\nis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj Kota\n&gt; \n&gt; .\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       The INTERNET now has a personality=\r\n.
