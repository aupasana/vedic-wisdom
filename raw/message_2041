It gives Gayatri \nmantra with intonation marked correctly. It has many other veda mantras too.\n\nI will point out a few standard mistakes I have seen people make:\n\n(1) People normally pronounce anudattas and svaritas (letters with lines \nbelow or above) correctly, but mess up when a few udattas come in a row. For \nexample, all the three letters in &quot;dheemahi&quot; are without any lines below or \nabove. They have to be pronounced in the same pitch. People end up \nintroducing some pitch variation and mispronouncing them. In veda mantras, \npronouncing all udattas in the same pitch is the most important thing. Do \nnot stress any letter or take the pitch up/down when pronouncing a string of \nudattas.\n\n(2) The last syllable of &quot;prachodayaat&quot; is &quot;yaat&quot;. It is supposed to be one \nsyllable. When you pronounce it correctly, &quot;t&quot; is hardly audible. If you \nartificially add an vowel at the end of it and make it &quot;prachodayaatu&quot;, you \nwill end up introducing an extra syllable (&quot;tu&quot;) and mess up everything. A \nlot of people do not pronounce &quot;t&quot; correctly. Probably some guru sometime \nback started the practice of adding a brief vowel at the end of words ending \nin a consonant, so that his sishyas could listen clearly what consonant he \nwas saying. Unfortunately, it became a standard practice. This is good for \nteaching, but wrong for sadhana. If a word ends in a consonant, end it with \na consonant (which cannot be heard clearly unless one tried hard) and do NOT \nadd a brief vowel after that consonant.\n\n(3) Take &quot;dhiyo yo naH&quot;. The &quot;H&quot; in &quot;naH&quot; is a visarga (written in Sanskrit \nas &quot;:&quot; and notated in itrans as &quot;H&quot;). Visarga means &quot;letting go&quot;. You are \nsupposed to let air go from you lungs in a quick exhalation. Pronunciation \nof &quot;naH&quot; is very close to &quot;nah&quot; though slightly different. Again, this is \nsupposed to be one syllable. A lot of people, especially south Indians, make \nit &quot;naha&quot;. Due to extra vowel added (a), an extra syllable (ha) is added to \nthe mantra and that messes up everything. Again this is wrong.\n\nIn this style of mispronouncing visarga, the same symbol &quot;H&quot; is pronounced \ndifferently in &quot;raamaH&quot;, &quot;hariH&quot; and &quot;guruH&quot;. The same symbol\n&quot;H&quot; or &quot;:&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; in the 3 words, respectively \n(i.e. raamaha, harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If you pronounce it as \nletting air go, without adding any vowel, it sounds identical in the 3 \nwords.\n\nWatch out for these 3 common mistakes.\n\nHowever, as I keep saying, the pronunciation is only a small percentage of \nit. Creating the right mental images and the perfect mental focus is more \nimportant. If you lose awareness of your body, successfully shut down all \nother thoughts in the mind and achieve a perfect mental focus on any veda \nmantra with correct pronunciation, it will be a fantastic experience. Please \nnote that correct pronunciation is not difficult to achieve, but the other \nthings I mentioned here are not that easy!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;sbm_sharma&quot; &lt;sbm_sharma@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, June 24, 2009 8:57 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Proper Gayatri Mantra Pronunciation and Intonation - \nAudio Source\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; Could you point me towards any easily obtainable audio recording of the \n&gt; Gayatri mantra which you deem to be correctly executed?\n&gt;\n&gt; Also, would you mind typing it out here, phonetically?
