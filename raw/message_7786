I have a large one purchased from India. The l=\r\namp can burn on 24X7 basis, with its oil capacity. \n\nI use Seasome oil and =\r\nit does not give smell. My wick comes as a roll and has been purchased from=\r\n Khadhi Bandar from Chennai. I cut a long length (say about 10&quot;size) cotton=\r\n thread from the wick roll and fold it, so that the thread has become thick=\r\ner and has two heads in once place for brighter and better lamp burning. \n\n=\r\nFor maintaining akhand jyoti, I have been increasing the wick length once i=\r\nn 8 hours, after removing the burnt ball from wick, which is falling with i=\r\nn the lamp. This is the only practical way I have experienced so far. \n\nI a=\r\nllow the lamp to be completely over once in a week. I clean the lamp thorou=\r\nghly for removing the burnt black balls that fell in oil/ lamp. \n\nPreviousl=\r\ny I used to burn flat lamp, where again the wick has to be protruded to inc=\r\nrease the length. \n\nRegards\n\n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;priya=\r\nnk_priyank&quot; &lt;aks_day@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste all, \n&gt; \n&gt; 3 days back i start=\r\ned keeping Akhand deep, (copper deep with central wick hole, Mustard oil). =\r\nAfter 2-3 hrs of burning the tip of the burning wick gets burned and forms =\r\nsmall charcoal ball and the flame becomes small. In night it got extinguish=\r\ned coz of same issue. \n&gt; \n&gt; for maintaining akhand jyot it seems one has to=\r\n increase the wick length for burning and remove burnt ball on top of wick =\r\nevery 5-6 hrs. this doesnt seem practical. i think i might be doing somethi=\r\nng wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please guide. \n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; priyank\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
