I will reply to them together.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding mail =\r\n1 below on priests:\n&gt; \n&gt; Doing rituals for one&#39;s own upliftment is one thin=\r\ng and doing it for others is another. In the former, one is cleaning up a d=\r\nirty place that one is forced to live in. In the latter, one is going to so=\r\nmeone else&#39;s dirty place and cleaning it up. If there is some radioactive w=\r\naste there and one is not protected, one may be affected.\n&gt; \n&gt; As I keep sa=\r\nying, results of one&#39;s previous karmas are like fruits lying in a basket. O=\r\nne takes out one fruit after another and eats them. Some may be tasty and s=\r\nome may be bitter or rotten. When one does rituals and other spiritual sadh=\r\nana, the deities throw away some bad fruits into a trash can and make one e=\r\nat good fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be some spillage as di=\r\nrty fruits are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be=\r\n affected by the spillage.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the old days, priests did intense sadhan=\r\na and generated enough purity to handle such things. Many priests of today =\r\ndo not do enough penance. They are quite vulnerable as they start messing w=\r\nith other people&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly, many priests of today who conduct=\r\n poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to a brahmana father is neithe=\r\nr necessary nor sufficient for one to become a brahmana oneself. One&#39;s apti=\r\ntude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today t=\r\nhink of power and influence over others or of money or of comforts. They ar=\r\ne not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. They are not really brahma=\r\nnas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastra=\r\ns are clear that rituals can be performed for others only by brahmanas. Wha=\r\nt it means is that one desirous of power, influence, money and comforts is =\r\nunfit to perform rituals for others.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Well, stop doing rituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance w=\r\nhen you are not doing rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahman=\r\na lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to trul=\r\ny become a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, ksh=\r\natriyas and vaisyas.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding mail 2 below on astrologers:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; This is not an immature comment and there is an element of truth in i=\r\nt. A lot of what I said above applies here too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Every action performed=\r\n with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an =\r\nastrologer&#39;s action of giving advice to someone resulted in that person doi=\r\nng X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in =\r\ncoming years, there is clearly an action here. If the astrologer has some s=\r\nense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to experience the fruits of it=\r\n. Some blessings can come and some sufferings can come too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Messing wi=\r\nth someone else&#39;s karmas is always a risky business.\n&gt; \n&gt; What is the solut=\r\nion? Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyl=\r\ne described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a=\r\n brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and va=\r\nisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a=\r\n brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with th=\r\ne karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals.=\r\n Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about b=\r\nrahmanas by conduct.\n&gt; \n&gt; The above will become clear, if you look at the c=\r\nriteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught Jyoti=\r\nsh!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Fre=\r\ne Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam =\r\nand Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films that make a dif=\r\nference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyotis=\r\nhWritings\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Mail 1:\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Are pr=\r\nesent Brahmanas suffering from any curse(Shapam)?\n&gt; &gt; This I am asking afte=\r\nr seeing the overall and general condition of Brahmanas specially those who=\r\n do pujas for Yajmanas and involved in Karmakanda.\n&gt; &gt; And if this is true =\r\nis there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; I think this is the only place where we c=\r\nan discuss this subject hence I am posting this query here.Thanks a lot in =\r\nadvance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mail 2:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;=\r\nrl_yhoo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training s=\r\nessions and am very eager to review my own chart. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; However in nume=\r\nrous instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and close uncles tha=\r\nt astrology can have a severe adverse impact on yourself (astrologer) and y=\r\nrou family.

They are quite vulnerable as they =\r\nstart messing with other people&#39;s karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Secondly, many p=\r\nriests of today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to =\r\na brahmana father is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become a b=\r\nrahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-l=\r\nike. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of mo=\r\nney or of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation.=\r\n They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas =\r\non earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for ot=\r\nhers only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influe=\r\nnce, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; is there any remedy for\n this?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Well, stop doing=\r\n rituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance when you are not doin=\r\ng rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle describe=\r\nd in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana =\r\nby overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Regarding mail 2 below on astrolog=\r\ners:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This is not an immature comment and there is an eleme=\r\nnt of truth in it. A lot of what I said above applies here too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Every action performed with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produc=\r\nes an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action of giving advice to someone=\r\n resulted in that person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and exp=\r\neriencing Z instead of W in coming years, there is clearly an action here. =\r\nIf the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to=\r\n experience the fruits of\n it. Some blessings can come and some sufferings =\r\ncan come too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s karmas is always=\r\n a risky business.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; What is the solution? Well, become a tr=\r\nue brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad =\r\nBhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcomin=\r\ng tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas. Irrespective of=\r\n where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahmana if one follo=\r\nws this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karmas of others by =\r\ngiving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again, to be clear, I=\r\n am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmanas by conduct.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The above will become clear, if you look at the criteria la=\r\nid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught Jyotish!&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n -----------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyo=\r\ntish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritu=\r\nal manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www=\r\n.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saras=\r\nwatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/J=\r\nyotishWritings&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/JyotishWritings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mail 1:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; =\r\n&lt;&lt;A rel=3Dnofollow&gt;aksha.rudra@...&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; A=\r\nre present Brahmanas suffering from any curse(Shapam)?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This I =\r\nam asking after seeing the overall and general condition of Brahmanas speci=\r\nally those who do pujas for Yajmanas and involved in Karmakanda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; And if this is true is there any remedy for this?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I think t=\r\nhis is the only place where we can discuss this subject hence I am posting =\r\nthis query here.Thanks a lot in advance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Mail 2:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;rl_yhoo=\r\n&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other edu=\r\ncated Scholars,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I have just started listening to=\r\n your (Narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training sessions and am very eager to review my =\r\nown chart. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; However in numerous instances in the=\r\n past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and close uncles that astrology can have =\r\na severe adverse impact on yourself (astrologer) and yrou\n family.
