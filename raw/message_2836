Infact it was from one writing of Sri Aurobindo tha=\r\nt I first got an idea that even a wrong pressence can come into an idol, th=\r\nough I am yet to recoincile it to the understanding I have about methods of=\r\n worship. He goes to mention that many of the Kali idols often have a prese=\r\nnce created by the worshipper which is Kali without being divine at all, a =\r\ngrotesque formation out of fear and other negative emotions of the worshipp=\r\ner. Such a being is of no help, and should not be worshipped. The actualy M=\r\nahakali, Aurobindo says, is splendid golden in color as he saw it. He said =\r\nit is also becuase of wrong pranpratistha and priests who do not know how t=\r\no do it etc.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; I find this information difficult to under=\r\nstand yet. I mean, if I am calling to Kali or any deity, is it not going to=\r\n Kali - the divine one? What does it matter how the pranpratistha has been =\r\ndone, if I am using the name Kali to address my prayers. There is only one =\r\nwho is Kali, and when I pray with Her name,=A0I feel it should always go to=\r\n that One. How can it reach any other being at all? \n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Now imagin=\r\ne someone gets an image of Kali and prays to it with fear, insecurities etc=\r\n and other negative emotional qualities, I can understand that these emotio=\r\nns - which are eventually an energy - may get lodged into the idol. But wha=\r\nt power does that mass of emotion have? In my view nothing. Neither good no=\r\nt bad. Now say another person comes infornt of the idol and bows down and s=\r\nays a prayer to Kali, where is that going to reach? I believe - logically -=\r\n it should reach=A0the real Kali wherever She maybe and idol will, even tho=\r\nugh it has negative emtions=A0lodged in it,=A0will only play the part of sy=\r\nmbol that makes one remember Kaali. \n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; This is how I look at it l=\r\nogically.

They perform rituals and make offerings w=\r\nhile harbouring\n&gt; &gt; such desires. Such tamasic and rajasic sentiments attra=\r\nct\n&gt; &gt; ill-intentioned beings from the vital plane to the place of worship.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Therefore she said that one should be cautious about which temple=\r\ns one\n&gt; &gt; visits, especially if one is weak and susceptible to negative ene=\r\nrgies.\n&gt; &gt; And when one does visit, one should try one&#39;s hardest to do so w=\r\nith the\n&gt; &gt; spirit of complete surrender to *whatever* Divine presence is t=\r\nhere (and\n&gt; &gt; without seeking to fulfil petty desires).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So it may =\r\nbe that there is a risk.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Samir\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On =\r\n08/10/2009 17:54, rajarshi nandy wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In this context of divine pressence, is Idol worship risky?
