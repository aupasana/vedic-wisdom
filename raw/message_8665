A few months=\r\n ago I was\nconsidering buying some books on puja\ninstructions(http://www.sh=\r\nreemaa.org/drupal/node/404\n&lt;http://www.shreemaa.org/drupal/node/404&gt;  ) and=\r\n I was thinking &quot;it\nwould be great to do a homam but it&#39;s probably for very=\r\n experienced\nsadhakas with the resources for it&quot;. Then, a few weeks later, =\r\nwhile\nsearching for something else I stumbled upon Narasimha Ji&#39;s website. =\r\nI\nimmediately thanked Lord Ganesa and Divine Mother and started reading.\n\nI=\r\n have very little space to do a homam, but decided to try the\n&quot;super-short =\r\nprocedure&quot;. I couldn&#39;t find any copper item, so I used a\ntiny glass contain=\r\ner, and tiny pieces of coconut with lots of ghee being\npoured. I have offer=\r\ned the 108 names of Lord Ganesha\n(&#39;Vighneshvarashtottara Shatanamavalih&#39; wh=\r\nich I took from the book\n&#39;Loving Ganesa&#39; by Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami=\r\n\n&lt;http://www.himalayanacademy.com/resources/books/lg/lg_ch-12.html&gt;  ),\nand=\r\n soon I will move on to Ganapati AtharvaShirsha. I can definitely say\nI&#39;ve =\r\nfelt an upliftment, and a  &#39;closeness&#39; to Lord Ganesha after doing\nit.\n\nNow=\r\n, my questions are:\n\n1. How important is it to use a homa kundam? I have ve=\r\nry little space,\nso the fire I can make is very small, so I have been think=\r\ning of using a\nsmall copper container. (I think this is almost close to a &#39;=\r\ndeepa homam&#39;\nas Narasimha Ji mentions here:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/v=\r\nedic-wisdom/message/4369\n&lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/messag=\r\ne/4369&gt;  )\n\n2. For those not well-versed in Sanskrit, how important is the =\r\nsadhaka&#39;s\nunderstanding of the mantra(s)? For exmaple, let&#39;s assume that on=\r\ne\nhasn&#39;t learnt the meanings of all the 108 names of Lord Ganesha. Then is\n=\r\nit better to offer a simple mantra that you understand, like &quot;Aum Sri\nGanes=\r\naya Namaha&quot; so you can concentrate on the meaning while offering\nit, rather=\r\n than offer mantras that you don&#39;t fully understand the\n(literal)meaning ye=\r\nt?\n\n3. If you invoke the deities back into your heart and finish the\nproced=\r\nure with &#39;Om Shanti Shanti Shanti&#39; before the fire goes out, is it\nok to &#39;s=\r\ntoke&#39; the fire after that, to make sure everything burns as much\nas possibl=\r\ne?\n\n4. Is it bad if there is some unburnt ghee or coconut left after\nfinish=\r\ning?\n\n5. Considering Soumya vs. Ugra Devatas, how do we apply the distincti=\r\non\nfor the Navagrahas? Should we consider Shani, Mangala, Rahu, Ketu, (even=\r\n\nSurya?) as Ugra Devatas? Since I&#39;m probably doing a lot of things wrong\nin=\r\n my procedure, I&#39;m only planning to invoke Soumya Devatas.\n\n6. If you are o=\r\nffering a single mantra many times, is there an easy way\nto count the numbe=\r\nr of repetitions?\n\nApologies for the long post, but hopefully someone can p=\r\nrovide some\nadvice here. If they have already been answered, may be someone=\r\n can\npoint me to it.\n\nThanks,\n\nRohana\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--4-7612865454-8916570191=:9\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;br&gt;Aum Sri Ganesaya Namaha!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I want to say hello to the mailing list=\r\n and thank Narasimha Ji and his Guru for introducing the homam manuals.
