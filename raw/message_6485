It is great work of 2 volumes around =\r\n700+ pages each, containing great details of the Yajna, but still lacking f=\r\null details. The preparation for this is very huge and  equally expensive ,=\r\n since they start with making vessels and items required as per the specifi=\r\ncations at the site and many involving recitations of specific mantras alon=\r\ng with it. It made me think\n&gt; whether it is even possible to make a small S=\r\noma Yajna manual which one could do individually, albeit occasionally, like=\r\n the various Havir Yajnas or Homa manuals made by Narasimha Manish and othe=\r\nrs!
