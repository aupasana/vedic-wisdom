Also I agree to the point that a meat eater, if he were to =\r\neat veg food for some months while reading the scriptures would feel spirit=\r\nually benefited.

I have a different exp=\r\nlanation. A meat eater is basically addicted to the taste of meat. When he =\r\nforgoes the same, it requires a degree of will-power and a conscious sense =\r\nof direction in the mind. Like overcoming any addiction with a clear sense =\r\nof purpose that I am doing it to help me spiritually benefit. This in turn,=\r\n when successfully done, creates a sense of purity in the mind. The reason =\r\nfor the purity is not so much about eating veg food, but more due to the me=\r\nntal force created by conscious abstinence from non veg food. \n=C2=A0\nSimil=\r\narly, a regular=C2=A0vegeterian, if he or she were to shift to a diet of ON=\r\nLY milk and fruits for some months=C2=A0- which is not his staple diet -=C2=\r\n=A0 would feel a similar effect. As I see it, generation of will power is t=\r\neh first conscinous effect of the=C2=A0beauty of sadhana. This sense of men=\r\ntal purity maybe - I am not sure - related to the generation of more bhutaa=\r\ngni.

I just saw a few mails from the vegetarianism thread. Just a few qui=\r\nck points.\n\n* * *\n\nSelf-identification of human beings and animals with bod=\r\ny and body parts is much much stronger and denser than that of plants and t=\r\nrees. Self-identification of plants and trees is very subtle. When a leaf o=\r\nr flower or fruit is plucked or cut off from a plant or tree, the emotion e=\r\nxperienced by it is very subtle. On the other hand, if a body part is cut o=\r\nff in an animal or a human being, the emotion experienced is much stronger.=\r\n Even after death, an animal may identify with the body and think of it as =\r\n&quot;I&quot;.\n\nThe kaarmik debt formed by eating the flesh of an animal, which the a=\r\nnimal&#39;s mind considers as a part of &quot;I&quot; and is highly attached to, is much =\r\nbigger than the kaarmik debt formed by eating leaves, vegetables or fruits =\r\nof a plant or a tree or killing bacteria.\n\nAs long as we live in a physical=\r\n body, creation of new kaarmik debts is inevitable. But we strive to minimi=\r\nze the debts we create newly.\n\n* * *\n\nYou are what you eat. Our body and va=\r\nrious chemicals and hormones in it are formed based on what we eat.\n\nMeat i=\r\ns highly taamasik. Eating meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and=\r\n identification with body and makes spiritual progress more difficult. Afte=\r\nr all, if one is eating flesh of an animal that was highly attached to its =\r\nbody, the quality of body attachment will become denser in one. This is not=\r\n conducive to spiritual progress.\n\n* * *\n\nIt is possible that a spiritual g=\r\niant from past ate meat and yet remained fully saattwik. However, it is not=\r\n easy to emulate such a person. One wanting to overcome identification with=\r\n the body and make spiritual progress, is better off eating saattwik food (=\r\nsimple vegetables, fruits, greens, grains etc with mild spices).\n\nIf a meat=\r\n-eating person stops eating meat and eats cooked vegetables, greens and len=\r\ntils/dals (for protein) for several months, while trying to read spiritual =\r\nliterature and trying to make spiritual progress, one will see that it make=\r\ns a big difference.\n\n* * *\n\nSomeone mentioned that Vyasa liked fish, Radha =\r\ncooked deer for Krishna etc. In matters like this, there is a lot of misgui=\r\nded propaganda in modern India. Assertions not backed by specific quotes fr=\r\nom classics or scriptures that can be verified by scholars are best ignored=\r\n.\n\nSwami Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have given a clarion call to Indians=\r\n to be more pro-active and energetic. But that does not require eating meat=\r\n. It is wrong to attribute to them support of meat eating.\n\nBest regards,\nN=\r\narasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nF=\r\nree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourse=\r\nlf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAst r=\r\nologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org \nSpirit=\r\nuality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      The INTERNET now has a p=\r\nersonality.

This is not conducive to spiritual progress.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is possible that a spiritual giant from past ate meat and =\r\nyet remained fully saattwik. However, it is not easy to emulate such a pers=\r\non. One wanting to overcome identification with the body and make spiritual=\r\n progress, is better off eating saattwik food (simple vegetables, fruits, g=\r\nreens,\n grains etc with mild spices).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If a meat-eating person stops =\r\neating meat and eats cooked vegetables, greens and lentils/dals (for protei=\r\nn) for several months, while trying to read spiritual literature and trying=\r\n to make spiritual progress, one will see that it makes a big difference.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Someone mentioned that Vyasa liked fish, Radha cooked de=\r\ner for Krishna etc. In matters like this, there is a lot of misguided propa=\r\nganda in modern India. Assertions not backed by specific quotes from classi=\r\ncs or scriptures that can be verified by scholars are best ignored.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nSwami Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have given a clarion call to Indians to=\r\n be more pro-active and energetic. But that does not require eating meat. I=\r\nt is wrong to attribute to them support of meat eating.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards=\r\n,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- -&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish\n Writings,&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://Saras=\r\nwatiFil ms.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ g=\r\nroup/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyotish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. ya=\r\nhoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/t=\r\nr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      &lt;!--1--&gt;&lt;hr size=3D1&gt;&lt;/hr&gt; \nThe INTERNET now has a =\r\npersonality.
