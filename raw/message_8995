You would\nbe surprised to know that this much talked inciden=\r\nt never happened in\nreality! An eye opening article by Shri Sanjeev Newar, =\r\nFounder- Agniveer.\nFull article can be found on the following link-\n\nhttp:/=\r\n/agniveer.com/sita-agnipariksha/\n\n[image: Sita Agni Pariksha -\nAgniveer]&lt;ht=\r\ntp://cdn.agniveer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/sitafire.jpg&gt;\n\nAgni Pariks=\r\nha is a myth\nThe Context\n\nOne of the most controversial episodes of Ramayan=\r\n is the *Agnipariskha\n(Test by Fire) of Sita*. As per the alleged episode, =\r\nafter Ram had defeated\nRavan and rescued Sita, he refused to accept her dou=\r\nbting her chastity.\nThus, Sita jumped into fire. The Fire God then rescued =\r\nher and hence she\ncame out unburnt. All gods came from heaven to convince R=\r\nam that Sita is\npure. He then agreed and accepted Sita.\n\nVarious strong vie=\r\nwpoints exist on this issue. *Traditionalists justify the\naction of Ram cit=\r\ning his overriding responsibility of setting right\nstandards in society as =\r\na king.* Feminists criticize the culture of that\nera and Hindu religion for=\r\n being *anti-woman*. Anti-feminists use this\nstory to explain why women sho=\r\nuld have *limited freedom*. Evangelists cite\nthis episode (among many other=\r\ns) to convince Hindus to leave Hinduism and\naccept any other religion. It i=\r\ns a favorite of *Dalit\nmovement*protagonists who showcase this as an exampl=\r\ne of Brahminical\ndogmatism. Miraclists (those who explain everything throug=\r\nh some miracles)\nexplain this as a grand strategy of divine. Some explain t=\r\nhat the Sita\nwhich was kidnapped by Ravan was actually a shadow of Sita and=\r\n actual Sita\nwas hiding inside fire. So when shadow Sita went inside the fi=\r\nre, actual\nSita came out.\nThe Loopholes\n\nWhat I always failed to understand=\r\n was *why Ram had to make such convoluted\nplans that would be known by none=\r\n in any case.* Could he not have\nimplemented some less controversial and ye=\r\nt more efficient plans?\n\nIn general, I have always been confused by stories=\r\n of miracles. The era\nbefore advent of videography and imagery seems to be =\r\nfull of miracles.\nFarther and remoter the place and event, more the probabi=\r\nlity of miracles\nexplaining it. Whether it be Purans, Bible or Quran, the* =\r\nkey events are\nexplained by some miracle or the other.* Whether it be split=\r\nting of Red\nSea, or travel across seven skies in one night, or splitting of=\r\n moon by\nsimply pointing it, or churning of sea or Sita being fire-proof, i=\r\nts all a\nmiracle happening everywhere which none of us has ever witnessed n=\r\nor expect\nto witness in our lives. These miracles happen very inconsistentl=\r\ny. For\nyears someone would toil and then suddenly achieve something through=\r\n\nmiracle.\n\nIf one considers these stories as symbolic of certain deeper fac=\r\nets of\nlife, it is indeed a very useful tool. *We have so much to learn fro=\r\nm such\nstories if we don=92t take them literally. *However, we are supposed=\r\n to\nblindly believe in them verbatim in order to not be termed blasphemous.=\r\n\nThis is where these *stories start separating religion from spiritualism.*=\r\n\n\nThe debates I often witness among religions =96 which religion is best =\r\n=96\neventually boils down to *who can prove the miracle of his religion to =\r\nbe\nmore authentic! *\n\nAnd the atheists would laugh down such tales of mirac=\r\nles as a reason to\nhate religion. So they lose an opportunity to be purpose=\r\nful in life,\nconsider themselves as chemical reactions and *become greatest=\r\n victims!*\n\nComing to the particular story of Sita=92s asbestos test (asbes=\r\ntos is the\nmaterial that is fully fire-proof), I could always see the flaws=\r\n in it. *The\nRamayan era seemed to be very liberal from perspective of wome=\r\nn\nrights.*Women even took part in battles. Obviously participating in\nbattl=\r\ne implies\nthat there is a huge risk of getting imprisoned. Ram=92s step-mot=\r\nher had\naccompanied Dashrath in one such war. So the family of Ram was quit=\r\ne\nliberal in these matters. Ram himself had been instrumental in uniting\nth=\r\nose women with their husbands who had been cheated by someone else. He\nmade=\r\n his friend Sugriva accept his wife again who was captured by his elder\nbro=\r\nther.\n\nAnd if we trace the overall theme of Ramayan, there is no doubt that=\r\n Ram\nwas a role model par-excellence. Few people have inspired me as much a=\r\ns\nMaryadapurushottam Sri Ramchandra. (other two being Hanuman and Krishna).=\r\n\nIts not out of nothing that he is the greatest icon of Hinduism for\nmillen=\r\nniums. *Thus, this story as well as many others seemed to me like\nanomalies=\r\n that contradicted the natural flow and other principles advocated\nin the s=\r\name Ramayan.*\n\nHad it been a mythological story, we could have let go of th=\r\nis episode as\nimagination of the author or symbolic of something else. Afte=\r\nr all, *there\nis no sensible way to explain what being fire-proof has to do=\r\n with chastity\nof a woman.* And if so, then all chaste woman should be fire=\r\n-proof, which\nclearly is not the case. Because chastity does not convert yo=\r\nur skin into\nasbestos. Further, what example is being set by such test in n=\r\not clear. In\nfact by expecting such miracles to prove chastity of woman, ge=\r\nnerations\nhave been misguided to denigrate women. *Needless to say, this no=\r\ntion of\nchastity is blatantly against Vedas and Manu Smriti. *\n\nIn case of =\r\nRamayan, the fact remains that it is a historical text, and not\nyet another=\r\n tales of Aladin. Further it is a text associated deeply with\nnot just Hind=\r\nu psyche. Ram is a role model for entire India regardless of\nreligion. He i=\r\ns a cultural icon. Thus these stories denigrate Hinduism,\nculture and natio=\r\nn =96 every thing. If these be true, if indeed Ram was\nanti-woman, then Ram=\r\n cannot be role model.\nThe Reality\n\n*So I decided to test out what the exac=\r\nt episode is in Ramayana.* Now\nRamayana is an epic text, and not a divine t=\r\next in lines of Vedas. So,\nwhile Vedas have been preserved for ages through=\r\n a variety of methods to\nprotect from even minutest aberration, other texts=\r\n have not enjoyed that\nprotection. Ramayan and Mahabharat are thus replete =\r\nwith latter day\nadulterations. Same is the case with Manu Smriti.\n\nPlease n=\r\note that for ages, there was no printing press and publication\nhouse to pub=\r\nlish authentic versions of any text. They used to be written by\nhand and me=\r\nmorized and spread across various schools and among scholars. So\nadulterati=\r\non was easier. While it would be impossible to decipher each\nadulteration, =\r\nif one analyzes one can identify the obvious adulterations. *Such\nadulterat=\r\nions can be identified by change in language style, change in\nstory flow, b=\r\neing out of context, suddenly a miracle happening and then the\nstory contin=\r\nuing again as normal and contradiction with rest of the text.*\n\nWe have alr=\r\neady analyzed how more than 50% verses of existing Manu Smriti\ncan be purge=\r\nd out as adulterated through analysis.\n\n*In case of Ramayan, if we analyze =\r\nthe verses elaborating the Sita\nFire-Proof test, startling truths emerge.*\n=\r\n\nThe story by and large goes on smoothly till 113th chapter of Yuddha Kand.=\r\n\nIn this chapter, Hanuman goes to Sita to inform her about victory of Ram.\n=\r\n\nIn Chapter 114, Ram states that *women are respected by the respect they\ng=\r\net from nation and their own habits. Any kind of restriction on women =96 o=\r\nf\nhome, dress code, boundary =96  in order to protect their respect is unwi=\r\nse. *\n*(27)*. This shloka sums up the Hindu view of woman.\n\nThe rest of the=\r\n verses in Chapter 114 except the last verse do not take the\nstory any furt=\r\nher. They seem to be adulterated.\n\nIn the first 6 verses of Chapter 115, Ra=\r\nm emotionally elaborates how he\ndestroyed the enemy who had committed a gra=\r\nve crime. In the next 4 verses,\nhe acknowledges the efforts of Hanuman, Sug=\r\nriva and Vibheeshan. Verses 11\nand 12 seems to be a clear adulteration that=\r\n act as a filler to redirect\nthe story.\n\nIn Verses 13 and 14, Ram expresses=\r\n his satisfaction of getting back Sita\nafter winning over such grave challe=\r\nnges.\n\n*And then in Verse 15, he takes a surprise U turn* and states that h=\r\ne did\nnot do all this to get back Sita. *Clearly this verse is an\nadulterat=\r\nion.*Not only it suddenly gives a new direction to the story,\nit does not r=\r\nelate\nto rest of the Ramayan where Ram had been even weeping in separation =\r\nof\nSita. Even if Ram had to force Sita for Fire-test, he could have said th=\r\nis\nstraight instead of lying here. In entire Ramayan, Ram has been a\ntruth-=\r\nseeker, so this sudden twist is an obvious adulteration.\n\n*And from there, =\r\nall the remaining verses of Chapter 115 appear clear\nadulteration.* For exa=\r\nmple, in verses 22 and 23 he advises her to live with\nBharat, Lakshman, Sug=\r\nriva, Shatrughna or Vibheeshan. The fake verses cover\nthe entire 116th chap=\r\nter where Sita answers Ram=92s allegations and asks\nLakshman to prepare a f=\r\nireplace. Then she jumps into it. Suddenly, in this\nchapter, all Rishis, Ga=\r\nndharvas, Gods emerge, who were non-existent so far.\n\nIn Chapter 117, all t=\r\nhe major Gods come to Ram to talk to him. This is\nperhaps the only instance=\r\n in Ramayan where divinity suddenly overpowers the\nnormal course of story. =\r\nThis is the first time that Ram is spoken of as the\nUltimate God Himself. I=\r\nf Ram alone is Ultimate God, why the lesser Gods are\ncoming to convince Him=\r\n of his =91mistake=92 is unexplained. And why Ram asked\nso many Gods to com=\r\ne. In this Chapter, they praise divinity of Ram for all\nthe 32 verses.\n\nIn =\r\nChapter 118, Fire God comes out with Sita in her lap and offers to Ram.\nThe=\r\nn Ram explains that he was playing a game to convince people about\nchastity=\r\n of Sita. Finally the last verse 22 says:*=93Having said so, Ram met\nSita w=\r\nith great happiness.=94*\n\nIf all verses from Chapter 115 verse 15 onwards u=\r\npto Chapter 118 verse 21\nare deleted, the story continues smoothly and this=\r\n intermediate miracle\ndrama has no relevance or impact whatsoever.\n\n*Recall=\r\n that Chapter 115 verse 14 has Ram emotionally explaining how he got\nback S=\r\nita with great efforts. And then Chapter 118 verse 22 says: =93Having\nsaid =\r\ndo, Ram met Sita with great happiness.=94 There is perfect continuity. *\n\nN=\r\now Chapters 119 and 120 are again pure adulterations where the Gods praise\n=\r\nRam even further, then Dashrath also comes with God Indra and they have\nver=\r\ny long discussions. Indra then makes dead soliders alive again through\nmagi=\r\nc. Chapter 121 starts with: *=93Ram slept peacefully that night and spoke\nw=\r\nith Vibheeshan in morning.=94 *With minor adulterations, story continues as=\r\n\nnormal about how Ram and Sita went back to Ayodhya on Pushpak plane. Now,\n=\r\ntill end of Ramayana, nowhere does any reference to miracles happening\nemer=\r\nge.\n\nSo, if one undertakes a cursory glance of Ramayan, this episode clearl=\r\ny\nemerges as a latter day adulteration which may have fuelled many debates,=\r\n\ngroupism, anti-Hindu mindset, anti-woman mindset, conversions and insults\n=\r\nthrown upon character of Ram. However, the fact remains that the very basis=\r\n\nfor all this is dubious.\n\nTo sum up:\n\nFollowing verses are clear adulterat=\r\nions:\n\n*Chapter 114: Verse 28 onwards, except last verse*\n\n*Chapter 115: Ve=\r\nrse 15 onwards*\n\n*Chapters 116 and 117*\n\n*Chapter 118: Except last verse*\n\n=\r\n*Chapters 119 and 120*\n\nIf you remove all these adulterations that bring di=\r\nscontinuity, the story\nmoves very smoothly and logically.\nReal Ramayan and =\r\nReal Mahabharat\n\n*Some other frivolous myths from Ramayan and Mahabharat th=\r\nat are used to\ndenigrate the noble culture of Hinduism but do not exist are=\r\n as follows:*\n\n*Ramayan:*\n\n- Sita exile (entire Uttar Ramayan is fictitious=\r\n and a latter day creation\nhaving no linkage with Valmiki)\n\n- Killing of Sh=\r\nambuka , a shudra by Ram (again fiction from frivolous Uttar\nRamayan)\n\n- Ha=\r\nnuman, Bali, Sugriva etc being monkeys or apes. They were human beings,\nHan=\r\numan was a great scholar, brilliant and impressive personality\n\n- Ram, Laks=\r\nhman, Sita being meat-eaters or alcohol consumers\n\n*Mahabharat:*\n\n- Draupad=\r\ni being married to 5 brothers. Her name was Panchali because she\nwas daught=\r\ner of ruler of Panchal, and not because she married 5 brothers.\n\n- Krishna =\r\nmarried 16000 plus wives.\n\nThe reason why Ramayan and Mahabharat were so su=\r\nsceptible to adulterations\nis also obvious. After Vedas, these 2 texts have=\r\n been the most respected\ntexts of Hinduism for several centuries now. So, i=\r\nf you are able to\nmanipulate these, it is easy to manipulate Hindus. Same i=\r\ns the case with\nManu Smriti =96 the oldest law book.\n\nThe greatest benchmar=\r\nk, thus, to identify truth is that if it is as per\nVedas or as per reason, =\r\naccept it. Else reject it as an adulteration.\nFollow the overall theme and =\r\ndo not be bogged by minor details if they\nappear contrary to reason.\n\nVedas=\r\n alone are true Dharma. Based on rock solid foundation of Vedas,\nHinduism i=\r\ns a culture that should be proud of not only all Indians but\nentire humanit=\r\ny.\n\nRam is a role model for entire world. We should be proud that we are\npr=\r\nogeny of Ram. Whether we respect Ram as a God or God-driven is a personal\nb=\r\nelief. But character of Ram is as pure as diamond. Agniveer is committed\nto=\r\n defence of glory of our role models.\n\nJai Shri Ram\n\nwith best wishes\n\nVash=\r\ni\nTeam Agniveer\nhttp://agniveer.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/agniveeragni\n=\r\nhttps://twitter.com/agniveer\n\r\n--e89a8ff1ce467b667004d545fc04\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nDear Members&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Namaskar!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kindly go through this research articl=\r\ne on Sita&#39;s Agni Pariksha!

Whether it be Pura=\r\nns, Bible or Quran, the&lt;strong&gt; key events are explained by some miracle or=\r\n the other.&lt;/strong&gt;\n Whether it be splitting of Red Sea, or travel across =\r\nseven skies in one\n night, or splitting of moon by simply pointing it, or c=\r\nhurning of sea \nor Sita being fire-proof, its all a miracle happening every=\r\nwhere which \nnone of us has ever witnessed nor expect to witness in our liv=\r\nes. These \nmiracles happen very inconsistently. For years someone would toi=\r\nl and \nthen suddenly achieve something through miracle.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If one consid=\r\ners these stories as symbolic of certain deeper facets of life, it is indee=\r\nd a very useful tool. &lt;strong&gt;We have so much to learn from such stories if=\r\n we don=92t take them literally.=A0&lt;/strong&gt;However, we are supposed to bli=\r\nndly believe in them verbatim in order to not be termed blasphemous.

So th=\r\ney lose an opportunity to be purposeful in life, \nconsider themselves as ch=\r\nemical reactions and &lt;strong&gt;become greatest victims!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Coming=\r\n\n to the particular story of Sita=92s asbestos test (asbestos is the \nmater=\r\nial that is fully fire-proof), I could always see the flaws in it. &lt;strong&gt;=\r\nThe Ramayan era seemed to be very liberal from perspective of women rights.=\r\n&lt;/strong&gt;\n Women even took part in battles. Obviously participating in batt=\r\nle \nimplies that there is a huge risk of getting imprisoned. Ram=92s \nstep-=\r\nmother had accompanied Dashrath in one such war. So the family of \nRam was =\r\nquite liberal in these matters.=A0Ram himself had been \ninstrumental in uni=\r\nting those women with their husbands who had been \ncheated by someone else.=\r\n He made his friend Sugriva accept his wife \nagain who was captured by his =\r\nelder brother.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And if we trace the \noverall theme of Ramayan, there i=\r\ns no doubt that Ram was a role model \npar-excellence. Few people have inspi=\r\nred me as much as \nMaryadapurushottam Sri Ramchandra. (other two being Hanu=\r\nman and \nKrishna). Its not out of nothing that he is the greatest icon of \n=\r\nHinduism for millenniums. &lt;strong&gt;Thus, this story as well as many \nothers =\r\nseemed to me like anomalies that contradicted the natural flow \nand other p=\r\nrinciples advocated in the same Ramayan.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Had \nit been a myth=\r\nological story, we could have let go of this episode as \nimagination of the=\r\n author or symbolic of something else. After all, &lt;strong&gt;there is no sensi=\r\nble way to explain what being fire-proof has to do with chastity of a woman=\r\n.&lt;/strong&gt;\n And if so, then all chaste woman should be fire-proof, which cl=\r\nearly is\n not the case. Because chastity does not convert your skin into \na=\r\nsbestos. Further, what example is being set by such test in not clear. \nIn =\r\nfact by expecting such miracles to prove chastity of woman, \ngenerations ha=\r\nve been misguided to denigrate women. &lt;strong&gt;Needless to say, this notion =\r\nof chastity is blatantly against Vedas and Manu Smriti.=A0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;I=\r\nn\n case of Ramayan, the fact remains that it is a historical text, and not\n=\r\n yet another tales of Aladin. Further it is a text associated deeply \nwith =\r\nnot just Hindu psyche. Ram is a role model for entire India \nregardless of =\r\nreligion. He is a cultural icon. Thus these stories \ndenigrate Hinduism, cu=\r\nlture and nation =96 every thing. If these be true, \nif indeed Ram was anti=\r\n-woman, then Ram cannot be role model.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;The Reality&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So=\r\n I decided to test out what the exact episode is in Ramayana.&lt;/strong&gt;\n Now=\r\n Ramayana is an epic text, and not a divine text in lines of Vedas. \nSo, wh=\r\nile Vedas have been preserved for ages through a variety of \nmethods to pro=\r\ntect from even minutest aberration, other texts have not \nenjoyed that prot=\r\nection. Ramayan and Mahabharat are thus replete with \nlatter day adulterati=\r\nons. Same is the case with Manu Smriti.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Please\n note that for ages, t=\r\nhere was no printing press and publication house \nto publish authentic vers=\r\nions of any text. They used to be written by \nhand and memorized and spread=\r\n across various schools and among scholars.\n So adulteration was easier. Wh=\r\nile it would be impossible to decipher \neach adulteration, if one analyzes =\r\none can identify the obvious \nadulterations. &lt;strong&gt;Such adulterations can=\r\n be identified by change in\n language style, change in story flow, being ou=\r\nt of context, suddenly a \nmiracle happening and then the story continuing a=\r\ngain as normal and \ncontradiction with rest of the text.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We =\r\nhave already analyzed how more than 50% verses of existing Manu Smriti can =\r\nbe purged out as adulterated through analysis.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;In case of Ram=\r\nayan, if we analyze the verses elaborating the Sita Fire-Proof test, startl=\r\ning truths emerge.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;The\n story by and large goes on smoothly=\r\n till 113th chapter of Yuddha Kand. \nIn this chapter, Hanuman goes to Sita =\r\nto inform her about victory of \nRam.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 114, Ram states that =\r\n&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;women are \nrespected by the respect they get from nation and th=\r\neir own habits. Any \nkind of restriction on women =96 of home, dress code, =\r\nboundary =96 =A0in order\n to protect their respect is unwise.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/em=\r\n&gt;&lt;strong&gt;(27)&lt;/strong&gt;. This shloka sums up the Hindu view of woman.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;=\r\nThe rest of the verses in Chapter 114 except the last verse do not take the=\r\n story any further. They seem to be adulterated.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In\n the first 6 ver=\r\nses of Chapter 115, Ram emotionally elaborates how he \ndestroyed the enemy =\r\nwho had committed a grave crime. In the next 4 \nverses, he acknowledges the=\r\n efforts of Hanuman, Sugriva and Vibheeshan. \nVerses 11 and 12 seems to be =\r\na clear adulteration that act as a filler \nto redirect the story.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In =\r\nVerses 13 and 14, Ram expresses his satisfaction of getting back Sita after=\r\n winning over such grave challenges.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And then in Verse 15, he=\r\n takes a surprise U turn&lt;/strong&gt; and states that he did not do all this to=\r\n get back Sita. &lt;strong&gt;Clearly this verse is an adulteration.&lt;/strong&gt;\n No=\r\nt only it suddenly gives a new direction to the story, it does not \nrelate =\r\nto rest of the Ramayan where Ram had been even weeping in \nseparation of Si=\r\nta. Even if Ram had to force Sita for Fire-test, he \ncould have said this s=\r\ntraight instead of lying here. In entire Ramayan, \nRam has been a truth-see=\r\nker, so this sudden twist is an obvious \nadulteration.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;And fr=\r\nom there, all the remaining verses of Chapter 115 appear clear adulteration=\r\n.&lt;/strong&gt;\n For example, in verses 22 and 23 he advises her to live with Bh=\r\narat, \nLakshman, Sugriva, Shatrughna or Vibheeshan. The fake verses cover t=\r\nhe \nentire 116th chapter where Sita answers Ram=92s allegations and asks \nL=\r\nakshman to prepare a fireplace. Then she jumps into it. Suddenly, in \nthis =\r\nchapter, all Rishis, Gandharvas, Gods emerge, who were non-existent\n so far=\r\n.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In Chapter 117, all the major Gods come to Ram to talk to\n him. Thi=\r\ns is perhaps the only instance in Ramayan where divinity \nsuddenly overpowe=\r\nrs the normal course of story. This is the first time \nthat Ram is spoken o=\r\nf as the Ultimate God Himself. If Ram alone is \nUltimate God, why the lesse=\r\nr Gods are coming to convince Him of his \n=91mistake=92 is unexplained. And=\r\n why Ram asked so many Gods to come. In \nthis Chapter, they praise divinity=\r\n of Ram for all the 32 verses.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;In\n Chapter 118, Fire God comes out wi=\r\nth Sita in her lap and offers to Ram.\n Then Ram explains that he was playin=\r\ng a game to convince people about \nchastity of Sita. Finally the last verse=\r\n 22 says:&lt;strong&gt;=93Having said so, Ram met Sita with great happiness.=94&lt;/=\r\nstrong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;If\n all verses from Chapter 115 verse 15 onwards upto Chapter=\r\n 118 verse 21 \nare deleted, the story continues smoothly and this intermedi=\r\nate miracle \ndrama has no relevance or impact whatsoever.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rec=\r\nall that \nChapter 115 verse 14 has Ram emotionally explaining how he got ba=\r\nck Sita\n with great efforts. And then Chapter 118 verse 22 says: =93Having =\r\nsaid \ndo, Ram met Sita with great happiness.=94 There is perfect continuity=\r\n.=A0&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now\n Chapters 119 and 120 are again pure adulterations =\r\nwhere the Gods praise\n Ram even further, then Dashrath also comes with God =\r\nIndra and they have\n very long discussions. Indra then makes dead soliders =\r\nalive again \nthrough magic. Chapter 121 starts with: &lt;strong&gt;=93Ram slept p=\r\neacefully that night and spoke with Vibheeshan in morning.=94=A0&lt;/strong&gt;Wi=\r\nth\n minor adulterations, story continues as normal about how Ram and Sita \n=\r\nwent back to Ayodhya on Pushpak plane.=A0Now, till end of Ramayana, \nnowher=\r\ne does any reference to miracles happening emerge.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;So, if \none undert=\r\nakes a cursory glance of Ramayan, this episode clearly emerges\n as a latter=\r\n day adulteration which may have=A0fuelled=A0many debates, \ngroupism, anti-=\r\nHindu mindset, anti-woman mindset, conversions and \ninsults thrown upon cha=\r\nracter of Ram. However, the fact remains that the\n very basis for all this =\r\nis dubious.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;To sum up:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Following verses are clear adulterations=\r\n:&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 114: Verse 28 onwards, except last verse&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/=\r\np&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 115: Verse 15 onwards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapters=\r\n 116 and 117&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapter 118: Except last verse&lt;/strong&gt;=\r\n&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Chapters 119 and 120&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;text-deco=\r\nration:underline&quot;&gt;If you remove all these adulterations that bring disconti=\r\nnuity, the story moves very smoothly and logically.=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;h2&gt;Real =\r\nRamayan and Real Mahabharat&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some\n other frivolous myths from=\r\n Ramayan and Mahabharat that are used to \ndenigrate the noble culture of Hi=\r\nnduism but do not exist are as follows:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;Ramayan:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Sita exile =\r\n(entire Uttar Ramayan is=A0fictitious=A0and a latter day creation having no=\r\n linkage with Valmiki)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;- Killing of Shambuka , a shudra by Ram (agai=\r\nn fiction from frivolous Uttar Ramayan)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-\n Hanuman, Bali, Sugriva etc=\r\n being monkeys or apes. They were human \nbeings, Hanuman was a great schola=\r\nr, brilliant \nand=A0impressive=A0personality&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Ram, Lakshman, Sita be=\r\ning meat-eaters or alcohol consumers&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;text-deco=\r\nration:underline&quot;&gt;Mahabharat:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;-\n Draupadi being marri=\r\ned to 5 brothers. Her name was Panchali because she\n was daughter of ruler =\r\nof Panchal, and not because she married 5 \nbrothers.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;- Krishna marrie=\r\nd 16000 plus wives.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The reason why\n Ramayan and Mahabharat were so su=\r\nsceptible to adulterations is also \nobvious. After Vedas, these 2 texts hav=\r\ne been the most respected texts \nof Hinduism for several centuries now. So,=\r\n if you are able to manipulate\n these, it is easy to manipulate Hindus. Sam=\r\ne is the case with Manu \nSmriti =96 the oldest law book.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;The\n =\r\ngreatest benchmark, thus, to identify truth is that if it is as per \nVedas =\r\nor as per reason, accept it. Else reject it as an adulteration. \nFollow the=\r\n overall theme and do not be bogged by minor details if they \nappear contra=\r\nry to reason.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;h2&gt;&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Vedas alone are \ntrue Dharma. Based on rock so=\r\nlid foundation of Vedas, Hinduism is a \nculture that should be proud of not=\r\n only all Indians but entire \nhumanity.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Ram is a role model for entir=\r\ne world. We should be proud\n that we are progeny of Ram. Whether we respect=\r\n Ram as a God or \nGod-driven is a personal belief. But character of Ram is =\r\nas pure as \ndiamond. Agniveer is committed to defence of glory of our role =\r\nmodels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;Jai Shri Ram&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;with best wishes&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Va=\r\nshi&lt;br&gt;Team Agniveer&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://agniveer.com/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;=\r\nhttp://agniveer.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;https://www.facebook.com/agniveera=\r\ngni&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/agniveeragni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;https://twitter.com/agniveer&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/agn=\r\niveer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--e89a8ff1ce467b667004d545fc04--\r\n\n"}}
