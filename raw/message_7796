These five elements are ruled by Ganapathi, \n&gt; Brahma,=\r\n Lakshmi & Vishnu, Rudra and Gouri. So we pray to them as they \n&gt; control o=\r\nur astitva or identity.\n&gt; \n&gt; Literal meaning of =E2=80=9Cgraha=E2=80=9D is =\r\none that grabs. We experience things as \n&gt; grahas or planets grab our consc=\r\niousness and make it experience the \n&gt; results (reactions) of various actio=\r\nns performed by us in the past. \n&gt; Grahas are the agents of karma phala (fr=\r\nuits of previous actions). Thus, \n&gt; grahas control our bhoktritva or experi=\r\nencership. So we pray to them, \n&gt; with ruling and co-ruling deities.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nen dikpalakas rule the ten directions (eight 2-dimensional directions, \n&gt; u=\r\np and down). They not only rule the physical directions, but the \n&gt; directi=\r\non one takes in life with one&#39;s work. For example, in Vedic \n&gt; astrology, a=\r\n chart called dasamsa shows one&#39;s work in society and the \n&gt; ten parts of t=\r\nhat chart are ruled by dikpalakas showing different kinds \n&gt; of work. Indra=\r\n, for example, shows work that asserts authority and \n&gt; control over others=\r\n (e.g. political leaders, managers). Agni, for \n&gt; example, shows work that =\r\ntransforms things (e.g. engineers, designers). \n&gt; Yama shows work related t=\r\no enforcing rules (e.g. quality assurance, \n&gt; police). Nirriti shows work t=\r\nhat breaks barriers (e.g. mafia, cutting \n&gt; edge innovations). And so on. I=\r\nt is dikpalakas who control our kartritva \n&gt; or doership and make us perfor=\r\nm different types of actions. So we pray \n&gt; to them.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
