This is written by\nS=\r\nmt. T.R. Kanakammal, in Mountain Path issue of July -September 2008.\n\nMahal=\r\nakshmi was the wife of Gangaraju Mallikarjuna Rao, from Vijayawada\nregion. =\r\nThey were Telugu Brahmins.Mr.Rao chanced to see a photo of Bhagavan\nbelongi=\r\nng to his friend, Balagopala Rao, a long time devotee from who was\nliving a=\r\nt Palakottu. Mallikarjuna Rao had a darshan of Bhagavan Ramana in\n1931.Bhag=\r\navan Ramana became his Sadguru instantaneously.For Mahalakshmi, her\nmother =\r\nwas the guru. It was a good fortune for Rao that he married\nMahalakshmi.Her=\r\n first darshan of Bhagavan in 1933 was a deeply rewarding\nexperience for he=\r\nr.Both became bhaktas of Bhagavan and visited the Asramam\nfrequently, never=\r\n missing Mahapuja and Jayanti celebrations. Bhagavan became\ntheir family de=\r\nity and they performed pujas daily with offerings of various\nkinds, as well=\r\n as regular recitation of Bhagavan&#39;s works.Mahalakshmi Amma\nused to stay in=\r\n the house of Alamelu Athai after 6 p.m.Once on a Sri Rama\nNavami day, Maha=\r\nlakshmi prepared panakam, neer mor and vadai paruppu and\nafter offering to =\r\nSri Rama and Bhagavan&#39;s pictures at the house, rushed to\nthe Asaramam, with=\r\n bucketfuls of these items around 4 a.m! As she was not\nconscious of the ti=\r\nme, the attendants told her to go back. Bhagavan Ramana\nwho suddenly happen=\r\ned to see her, looked at her with compassion and\nexclaimed: &quot;Look! Lord Ram=\r\nachandra has come to the Asramam so early. Come\nand distribute the prasad t=\r\no everyone!&quot;\n\nThis was one of the incidents to bring to light the extraordi=\r\nnary purity of\nher devotion, which was rewarded by Bhagavan Ramana.On anoth=\r\ner day,\nMahalakshmi Amma had a dream where Bhagavan was asking her to prepa=\r\nre some\nmysorepak for Him! The next morning, Mahalakshmi Amma euphorically =\r\nprepared\nmysorepak, offered it to Bhagavan&#39;s picture in the house, and took=\r\n it to the\nAsramam. Before that the couple decided to make a fullfledged bh=\r\niksha also\nto Bhagavan Ramana and His devotees in the Asramam. During lunch=\r\n, Bhagavan\nand others were served by Mahalakshmi Amma herself. Bhagavan Ram=\r\nana, after\ntaking the mysorepak asked: &quot;Will another piece be available to =\r\neveryone?&quot;\nMahalakshmi Amma who was in seventh heaven replied: &quot;Why not Bha=\r\ngavan!\nDhandikaundi!&quot; (It is available in plenty). Bhagavan Ramana who neve=\r\nr asked\nfor a second helping made an exception in her case, due to her pure=\r\n\ndevotion!\n\nMr. Mallikarjuna Rao was in transport business and owned a flee=\r\nt of\nbuses.The couple thus became prosperous, but were simple souls,living\n=\r\nvirtuous lives with generous charitable dispositions.Theirs was a prolific\n=\r\nfamily too. Mahalakshmi always had a small baby to nurse.Despite a long\njou=\r\nrney from Vijayawada, they desired to meet Bhagavan Ramana as often as\nposs=\r\nible, with all their children.They had five daughters and four\nsons.Unfortu=\r\nnately, all the four sons died young. The successive tragedy\nbroke their he=\r\narts and it was difficult for them to come to terms with this\ntragedy.\n\nWhe=\r\nn a fifth son was born, they brought the child to the Asramam in its\nsixth =\r\nmonth for Anna Prasanam. (Introducing the child to Anna or cooked rice\nfor =\r\nthe first time). When they brought the child, Bhagavan Ramana agreed\nsaying=\r\n, &quot;Good!&quot; They arranged for a bhiksha with Pal Payasam (Rice boiled in\nmilk=\r\n with sugar). When all sat for lunch, Chinnaswami brought a silver bowl\ngiv=\r\nen by Mahalakshmi, with\nPal Payasam and placed it before Bhagavan.While Rao=\r\n was holding the child in\nfront of Bhagavan, He tasted a little of Payasam =\r\nand fed the child with\nPayasam three times. The child was indeed blessed. B=\r\nut after reaching home,\nthis child too unfortunately died.\n\nThe couple wond=\r\nered whether they were destined to have any male progeny at\nall. They consu=\r\nlted astrologers and did various rituals. Sometime in\n1947-48, a sixth male=\r\n child was born to them. The couple decided to bring up\nthe child with begg=\r\ned food and begged clothes. The friends who knew this\npeculiar &quot;vrata&quot; help=\r\ned them. After a few months, they again desired to\nperform Anna Prasanam in=\r\n the holy presence of Bhagavan Ramana.\n\nThe family arrived in the Asramam o=\r\nne week in advance. They waited patiently\nin front of the ladies&#39; guesthous=\r\ne for Bhagavan&#39;s return from the post\noffice. They prostrated and Rao told =\r\nBhagavan the reason for their visit and\nthen they held the child in front o=\r\nf Bhagavan. Bhagavan Ramana playfully\nsnapped His thumb and middle finger t=\r\no attract the attention of the child.\nThe child, leaning towards Him and lo=\r\noking at Him fixedly, caught hold of\nBhagavan&#39;s hand and started to suck Hi=\r\ns thumb! Bhagavan Ramana was amused\nand said to the child, &quot;Won&#39;t you go?&quot; =\r\nRao had to forcibly take away the\nchild. A bhiksha was arranged for the aus=\r\npicious day. When there were just\ntwo days to go before the function, the c=\r\nhild became suddenly ill, with high\nfever. Dr. M.R. Krishnamoorthy, a devot=\r\nee of Bhagavan Ramana, who was then\nat the Asramam, treated the child, but =\r\nthe fever did not subside.\n\nMahalakshmi Amma&#39;s heart became numb with fear.=\r\n She was convinced that if\nBhagavan were to touch the child and apply &#39;vibh=\r\nuti&#39; to its forehead, the\nchild would survive. She carried the child with s=\r\nome &#39;vibhuti&#39; and waited\nfor Bhagavan Ramana to pass by from gosala. When s=\r\nhe prayed to Him, Bhagavan\nRamana remained silent for. She repeatedly begge=\r\nd and beseeched Him and\nBhagavan, just to satisfy her, applied &#39;vibhuti&#39; an=\r\nd went on His way.\nUnfortunately, the next day, the child died! Mallikarjun=\r\na Rao had been away\nto Madras, and he was to return only the next day.\n\nBha=\r\ngavan Ramana with great compassion and solicitude, sent someone to the\nRail=\r\nway station to fetch him, with instructions to break the sad news only\non a=\r\npproaching the Asramam.When he did hear the news, he threw down on the\nroad=\r\n all the playthings\nhe had bought for his child and wept broken hearted.Whe=\r\nn this was reported\nto Bhagavan Ramana, He narrated the happening of the pr=\r\nevious day, how\nMahalakshmi had insisted on His touching the child to apply=\r\n &#39;the\nvibhuti&#39;.Bhagavan Ramana said: &quot;Wondering why I just kept quiet in sp=\r\nite of\nher insistence, she begged and so I applied &#39;the vibhuti&#39;. The next =\r\nday, the\nchild died. Nayana used to tell all devotees, &#39;Do not allow childr=\r\nen to be\ntouched by Bhagavan. If you do, He will liberate them at once!&#39; &quot;\n=\r\n\nBut a slender hope lurked in Mahalakshmi Amma, who had boundless faith in\n=\r\nand devotion to Bhagavan. She hoped that the child might, by Bhagavan&#39;s\nGra=\r\nce, come back to life. Those were the days, when orthodoxy reigned\nsupreme =\r\nand orthodox rules forbade her to bring the lifeless body of the\nchild into=\r\n the presence of Bhagavan Ramana, although her maternal heart\nyearned for H=\r\nis Grace.\n\nA little distance away from the path to the &#39;gosala&#39; was a huge =\r\nhaystack.\nWith great terpidation and hesitation, she brought the lifeless c=\r\nhild and\nlaid it on the ground by the haystack and waited with abundant hop=\r\ne for\nBhagavan to pass by. Varanasi Subbalakshmi Amma, who was by her side\n=\r\nconsoled her and gave moral support to the grieving mother.\n\nWhen Bhagavan =\r\nRamana did come, Mahalakshmi was hesitant to come near and\nprostrated from =\r\nwhere she was. Bhagavan, the very embodiment of compassion,\nstopped and res=\r\nted His eyes on the child with a long look of grace. He stood\nin silence fo=\r\nr sometime and proceeded on His way. The desolate mother took\nin the situat=\r\nion and stood speechless. She resigned herself to her\n&#39;prarabdha&#39; from whic=\r\nh she realized that there was no escape. Next day, they\nbathed the child an=\r\nd adorned it with garlands from the Matrubhuteswara\nTemple. Later that morn=\r\ning, they buried the child.\n\nThey then packed for the trip home. Their trai=\r\nts was leaving at 9 p.m. and\nat 2 p.m. they came into the presence of Bhaga=\r\nvan Ramana, in the Jubilee\nHall in order to take leave of Him and avoid the=\r\n crowd which would gather\naround for Vedaparayanam in the evening. As if to=\r\n do away with their grief,\nthe divine will prompted a devotee to pose certa=\r\nin questions to Bhagavan\nRamana, the answers to which brought soothing comf=\r\nort to the sorrow stricken\nparentss and lifted them from their despondency.=\r\n Bhagavan&#39;s responses gave\nthem courage and fortitude and made them feel co=\r\nnsoled at the thought that,\nas the child had given up his body in the Holy =\r\nAbode of Bhagavan, hsi short\nprarabdha had been spent, he must have attaine=\r\nd a high state of being in his\nspiritual evolution.\n\nEarly next morning, wh=\r\nen Bhagavan Ramana enquired where the child had been\nburied, he was told, &#39;=\r\nSomewhere outside.&#39; Bhagavan Ramana remarked, &quot;This\nchild could have been b=\r\nuried here, but if that had been done, this place\nwould become a general bu=\r\nrial ground.&quot;\n\nWhen I (Kanakammal) narrated His comment to Mahalakshmi, dur=\r\ning her next\nvisit, she felt tremoundously comforted and said: &quot;The child&#39;s=\r\n spiritual\nfuture has been assured!&quot;\n\nMallikarjuna Rao, was a tall, hefty a=\r\nnd robust looking.Mahalakshmi was tall\nas well, but slim and delicate. Her =\r\nfrail frame belied her mental fortitude,\nresoluteness and indomitable inner=\r\n strength. She wore a sari in the Andhra\nBrahmin style, and like Suri Nagam=\r\nma, was endowed with luxuriant, long, dark\nhair. But she lived an austere a=\r\nnd orthodox life with self imposed rules of\nphysical and mental discipline.=\r\nShe would get up at 3.30 am everyday and\nafter a bath,engage herself in puj=\r\na and parayana and reciting her favourite\nbook, Grantha Mala (The Complete =\r\nWorks of Bhagavan, in Telugu). Her major\noccupation during the day was tell=\r\ning the beads of a mala (rosary) with\nBhagavan&#39;s name. Even while engaged i=\r\nn household work, like cutting\nvegetables, or cooking, she would be speakin=\r\ng mentally to Bhagavan, saying,\n&quot; Bhagavan!I am making such and such vegeta=\r\nble today, as per your command.&quot;\nThus with her mind focussed on Bhagavan an=\r\nd with all her constant thoughts\nand actions centred on Bhagavan, she creat=\r\ned an atmosphere permeated with\nthe presence of Bhagavan and revelled in it=\r\n, wherever she was.\n\nMahalakshmi Amma, had a large family to attend to and =\r\nwhilst doing so she\nhad the habit of executing all the household work as th=\r\nough commanded by\nBhagavan Ramana. Whatever was cooked, was eaten only afte=\r\nr being offered to\nBhagavan. While, eating, whether at home or outside, she=\r\n observed silence.\nEven in the Asramam, due her strict adherence to orthodo=\r\nx rules, she used to\ndine in the kitchen with the permission of the Asrmam =\r\nmanagement.When coming\nfor lunch,she would bring three small bowls in a bag=\r\n. Receiving a small\nquantity of side dishes in the bowls and rice on a leaf=\r\n plate, she would\nnever acccept a second helping. Even the served food she =\r\nate only after\noffering it to Bhagavan Ramana. She was to be found at all o=\r\nther times to\nremain in dhyana in Bhagavan&#39;s Hall. Even after the traged na=\r\nrrated above,\nthe couple with their other children frequently visited the A=\r\nsramam.\n\nThe entire family came to the Asramam for the &#39;kumbhabhisekham of =\r\nthe\nMatrubhuteswara Temple. The children, especially the older ones who had=\r\n for\nsome time not had the opportunity to sit with Bhagavan during lunch, l=\r\nonged\nto sit beside Him. The day of their return home was fast approaching.=\r\n One\nday, Mahalakshmi Amma managed to bring all of them just in time for lu=\r\nnch.\nSomehow she managed to find places for everyone except for herself and=\r\n the\neldest daughter, who was very disappointed as she was unsure whether s=\r\nhe\nwould accompany her parents the next time. Both stood at the threshold o=\r\nf\nthe dining hall from where they feasted their eyes on Bhagavan. When lunc=\r\nh\nhad been completely served to everyone, Bhagavan usually signalled its st=\r\nart\nby nodding His head. But this time, He looked to His left and right, to=\r\nld\nsomeone to lay two more leaves, between Him and the entrance of the kitc=\r\nhen\nand asked Mahalakshmi and her daughter to seat themselves before these\n=\r\nleaves.He waited until they had been served and only then nodded, signallin=\r\ng\nthe start of the lunch. As their leaves were so near Bhagavan&#39;s leaf, wit=\r\nh\ngreat reverence mingled with awe, they took the greatest care not to scat=\r\nter\nany rice out of the leaves.They ate happily, enjoying the meal and the\n=\r\nprofound grace of Bhagavan. They respectfully waited until Bhagavan finishe=\r\nd\nHis food. Mahalakshmi often recalled this incident with tears, gratefully=\r\n\nsaying how fortunate their family was to be blessed by Bhagavan again and\n=\r\nagain.\n\nWhen they heard of the impending operation on Bhagavan for the canc=\r\nerous\ngrowth, they immediately travelled to the Asramam.A throng of people =\r\nhad\ngathered, however, darsan for that day was over. Early next morning,\nMa=\r\nhalakshmi arrived at the Asramam and sat at the entrance of the Mother&#39;s\nTe=\r\nmple, in front of the closed doors behind which Bhagavan Ramana was\nresting=\r\n. As she was telling her beads, suddenly the doors opened and\nBhagavan emer=\r\nged.Looking at her, Bhagavan said, &quot;Um...Um...&quot;, acknoweldged\nher presence =\r\nand walked to the now Mahanirvana Room. That every afternoon,\ndarsan re-com=\r\nmenced and they returned home after jointly seeing Bhagavan!\n\nLater, when B=\r\nhagavan&#39;s health had deteriorated very badly, they were unable\nto stay away=\r\n and returned again to the Asramam, which was now swarming with\npeople. Mah=\r\nalakshmi had brought with her a new towel, some raisins and sugar\ncubes.She=\r\n stood opposite the Mother&#39;s Temple and looked towards the Nirvana\nRoom.Her=\r\n one longing was to preserve these items as relics, after wiping the\nfeet o=\r\nf Bhagavan with the towel and after a simple glance at the raisins and\nsuga=\r\nr cubes by Him.Tears were streaming down her cheeks.Bhagavan the living\nemb=\r\nodiment of compassion, sent a Telugu-speaking gentleman to find out what\nsh=\r\ne wanted. When she disclosed her desire, the gentleman taking the articles\n=\r\nwith Him, informed Bhagavan of her desire. Then Bhagavan, the ocean of\ngrac=\r\ne, stretched His feet so that he would wipe both His feet with that\ntowel. =\r\nBhagavan, who could now eat practically nothing, ate a few of the\nraisins. =\r\nWhen all the three items were returned to her, Mahalakshmi Amma was\noverwhe=\r\nlmed by great joy and profound grief at the same time. She preserved\nthese =\r\nitems as most precious relics in her puja room and worshipped them\ntill the=\r\n end of her life.\n\nSuch a tranquil life, poised in joy and serenity, was no=\r\nw buffeted by\nstorms. Misfortunes befell,starting with the Mahasamadhi of B=\r\nhagavan. Soon\naferwards, Mallikarjuna passed away.In the absence of a compe=\r\ntent person to\nconduct the family business it soon fell into decline. Their=\r\n affluence\nfaded.With only two daughters married, the entire responsibilty =\r\nof marrying\nthe other two daughters, had to be borne by her, though she was=\r\n assisted by\nher elder son-in-law.Caught as she was in the tribulations of =\r\nsupporting her\nfamily, her visits to the Asramam became few and far between=\r\n.But her inner\npoise and serenity remained untouched. At last, when all res=\r\nponsibilities\nhad been discharged by the grace of Bhagavan, she resumed her=\r\n visits to the\nAsramam. Though her husband had bought a huge plot of land o=\r\nn which to build\na house, for various reasons this did not materialize, so =\r\nshe rented a\nroom.Now she further tightened her self-imposed disciplinary r=\r\nules.She at\nonly what she had cooked for herself -- a simple lunch in the a=\r\nfternoon and\na light meal at night.It was a spartan life, given wholly to d=\r\nevotional\npractice and dhyana.With no more responsibilities weighing her do=\r\nwn, she was\nlike a bird released from its cage. Unattached, independent, hi=\r\nghly\ndispassionate, and beaming with joy, her life reflected her inner peac=\r\ne.\n\nOnce she arrived back at the Asramam, after a long time.There was a\nnot=\r\niceable difference in her appearance.With the loss of her husband, she\nhad =\r\nadoped the attire of a widow, white saris with a small coloured border\nat t=\r\nhe bottom. But now her long hair was gone and she was dressed in the\nstrict=\r\n orthodox garb of a widow -- we saw a plain white sari with shaven\nhead.The=\r\n only ornaments were a &#39;rudraksha mala&#39; and a &#39;spatika mala&#39;.She\nlooked the=\r\n picture renunciation.I asked her why she had resorted to such an\nextreme s=\r\ntep of self-abnegation.She explained what had happened.\n\nWhen things took a=\r\n turn for the worse, she had needed spiritual reassurance\nto steady her inn=\r\ner peace which was seriously threatened.The Paramacharya of\nKanchipuram [Sr=\r\ni Chandrasekhara Saraswati Swamigal] and Abinave Vidya\nTeertha of Sringeri =\r\nMath,were both then touring Andhra Pradesh separately,\ncamping at various p=\r\nlaces. The high esteem in which she had held the revered\nAcharya of Kanchi =\r\nKamakoti Math made her decide to meet him, but strict\northodoxy stood in he=\r\nr way.Brahmin widows with unshaven heads [in those\ndays] could view him onl=\r\ny from a distance. To have a private audience with\nhim or to get the &#39;prasa=\r\nd&#39; of holy water from him, she had to shave her\nhead. The prospect of dista=\r\nnt darsan did not satisfy her.Her tenacity of\npurpose and her eagerness not=\r\n to let the opportuntiy slip away, decided the\nissue. Her hair, that was ti=\r\nll luxuriant, was cut off and her head\nshaved.Now she sought and got the lo=\r\nnged-for private interview with the\nSage.The outcome was very positive. Her=\r\n inner poise was restored and she\nfollowed him thorughout his tour in Andhr=\r\na.Thus reassured she was at peace\nas never before, with all the composure o=\r\nf still waters.\n\nWhen she became old, she could not come to the Asramam, as=\r\n before and it was\nthrough one of her daughters who came occasianally that =\r\nI [Smt. Kanakammal ]\ngot news of her. After sometime I heard of her passing=\r\n away. The adversities\nshe had faced after the demise of her husband were i=\r\nnnumerable. But she had\nfaced them with equqnimity. Because her heart was f=\r\namily anchored at\nBhagavan Ramana&#39;s feet, she emerged victorious from all s=\r\ntruggles, with her\ninner calm unruffled.\n\nThus ended the inspiring life of =\r\na pure and holy devotee who had to wage a\nheroic battle with life, armed so=\r\nlely with the weapon of pure devotion and\nthe grace of Bhagavan Ramana and =\r\nthe kingdom of peace was her gain. This\nechoes what the Lord said in Srimad=\r\n Bhagavatam, in Skandam 10, Chapter 88,\nVersses 8-9:\n\nThe meaning of which =\r\nis:\n\n&quot;He on whom I am going to bestow My Grace, I solemnly deprive of him o=\r\nf all\nhis wealth. When his wealth has gone, all his friends,his kith and ki=\r\nn will\ndesert him, making him sink into the utmost sorrow and despair. When=\r\n his\nfurther efforts to gain wealth also fail, thanks to My will, he become=\r\ns\nfilled with dispassion and becomes\nassociated with My devotees.

This is written by Smt. T.R. Kanakammal, in Mountain Path iss=\r\nue of July -September 2008.=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt:bold&quot;&gt;Mahalakshmi was the wife of Gangaraju Mallikarjuna Rao, from Vijaya=\r\nwada region. They=C2=A0were Telugu Brahmins.Mr.Rao chanced to see a photo o=\r\nf Bhagavan belonging to his friend, Balagopala Rao, a long time devotee fro=\r\nm who was living at Palakottu. Mallikarjuna Rao had a darshan of Bhagavan R=\r\namana in 1931.Bhagavan Ramana became his Sadguru instantaneously.For Mahala=\r\nkshmi, her mother was the guru. It was a good fortune for Rao that he marri=\r\ned Mahalakshmi.Her first darshan of Bhagavan in 1933 was a deeply rewarding=\r\n experience for her.Both became bhaktas of Bhagavan and visited the Asramam=\r\n frequently, never missing Mahapuja and Jayanti celebrations. Bhagavan beca=\r\nme their family deity and they performed pujas daily with offerings of vari=\r\nous kinds, as well as regular recitation of Bhagavan&#39;s works.Mahalakshm=\r\ni Amma used to stay in the house of Alamelu Athai after 6 p.m.Once on a Sri=\r\n Rama Navami day, Mahalakshmi prepared panakam, neer mor and vadai paruppu =\r\nand after offering to Sri Rama and Bhagavan&#39;s pictures at the house, ru=\r\nshed to the Asaramam, with bucketfuls of these items around 4 a.m! As she w=\r\nas not conscious of the time, the attendants told her to go back. Bhagavan =\r\nRamana who suddenly happened to see her, looked at her with compassion and =\r\nexclaimed: &quot;Look! Lord Ramachandra has come to the Asramam so early. C=\r\nome and distribute the prasad to everyone!&quot;=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;This was one of the incidents to bring to ligh=\r\nt the extraordinary purity of her devotion, which was rewarded by Bhagavan =\r\nRamana.On another day, Mahalakshmi Amma had a dream where Bhagavan was aski=\r\nng her to prepare some mysorepak for Him! The next morning, Mahalakshmi Amm=\r\na euphorically prepared mysorepak, offered it to Bhagavan&#39;s picture in =\r\nthe house, and took it to the Asramam. Before that the couple decided to ma=\r\nke a fullfledged bhiksha also to Bhagavan Ramana and His devotees in the As=\r\nramam. During lunch, Bhagavan and others were served by Mahalakshmi Amma he=\r\nrself. Bhagavan Ramana, after taking the mysorepak asked: &quot;Will anothe=\r\nr piece be available to everyone?&quot; Mahalakshmi Amma who was in seventh=\r\n heaven replied: &quot;Why not Bhagavan! Dhandikaundi!&quot; (It is availab=\r\nle in plenty). Bhagavan Ramana who never asked for a second helping made an=\r\n exception in her case, due to her pure devotion!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Mr. Mallikarjuna Rao was in transport business and =\r\nowned a fleet of buses.The couple thus became prosperous, but were simple s=\r\nouls,living virtuous lives with generous charitable dispositions.Theirs was=\r\n a prolific family too. Mahalakshmi always had a small baby to nurse.Despit=\r\ne a long journey from Vijayawada, they desired to meet Bhagavan Ramana as o=\r\nften as possible, with all their children.They had five daughters and four =\r\nsons.Unfortunately, all the four sons died young. The successive tragedy br=\r\noke their hearts and it was difficult for them to come to terms with this t=\r\nragedy.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When a fifth son was born, they brought the c=\r\nhild to the Asramam in its sixth month for Anna Prasanam. (Introducing the =\r\nchild to Anna or cooked rice for the first time). When they brought the chi=\r\nld, Bhagavan Ramana agreed saying, &quot;Good!&quot; They arranged for a bh=\r\niksha with Pal Payasam (Rice boiled in milk with sugar). When all sat for l=\r\nunch, Chinnaswami brought a silver bowl given by Mahalakshmi, with&lt;br&gt;\n\nPal=\r\n Payasam and placed it before Bhagavan.While Rao was holding the child in f=\r\nront of Bhagavan, He tasted a little of Payasam and fed the child with Paya=\r\nsam three times. The child was indeed blessed. But after reaching home, thi=\r\ns child too unfortunately died.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The couple wondered whether they w=\r\nere destined to have any male progeny at all. They consulted astrologers an=\r\nd did various rituals. Sometime in 1947-48, a sixth male child was born to =\r\nthem. The couple decided to bring up the child with begged food and begged =\r\nclothes. The friends who knew this peculiar &quot;vrata&quot; helped them. =\r\nAfter a few months, they again desired to perform Anna Prasanam in the holy=\r\n presence of Bhagavan Ramana.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The family arrived in the Asramam on=\r\ne week in advance. They waited patiently in front of the ladies&#39; guesth=\r\nouse for Bhagavan&#39;s return from the post office. They prostrated and Ra=\r\no told Bhagavan the reason for their visit and then they held the child in =\r\nfront of Bhagavan. Bhagavan Ramana playfully snapped His thumb and middle f=\r\ninger to attract the attention of the child. The child, leaning towards Him=\r\n and looking at Him fixedly, caught hold of Bhagavan&#39;s hand and started=\r\n to suck His thumb! Bhagavan Ramana was amused and said to the child, &quot=\r\n;Won&#39;t you go?&quot; Rao had to forcibly take away the child. A bhiksha=\r\n was arranged for the auspicious day. When there were just two days to go b=\r\nefore the function, the child became suddenly ill, with high fever. Dr. M.R=\r\n. Krishnamoorthy, a devotee of Bhagavan Ramana, who was then at the Asramam=\r\n, treated the child, but the fever did not subside.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Mahalakshmi Am=\r\nma&#39;s heart became numb with fear. She was convinced that if Bhagavan we=\r\nre to touch the child and apply &#39;vibhuti&#39; to its forehead, the chil=\r\nd would survive. She carried the child with some &#39;vibhuti&#39; and wait=\r\ned for Bhagavan Ramana to pass by from gosala. When she prayed to Him, Bhag=\r\navan Ramana remained silent for. She repeatedly begged and beseeched Him an=\r\nd Bhagavan, just to satisfy her, applied &#39;vibhuti&#39; and went on His =\r\nway. Unfortunately, the next day, the child died! Mallikarjuna Rao had been=\r\n away to Madras, and he was to return only the next day.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan =\r\nRamana with great compassion and solicitude, sent someone to the Railway st=\r\nation to fetch him, with instructions to break the sad news only on approac=\r\nhing the Asramam.When he did hear the news, he threw down on the road all t=\r\nhe playthings&lt;br&gt;\n\nhe had bought for his child and wept broken hearted.When=\r\n this was reported to Bhagavan Ramana, He narrated the happening of the pre=\r\nvious day, how Mahalakshmi had insisted on His touching the child to apply =\r\n&#39;the vibhuti&#39;.Bhagavan Ramana said: &quot;Wondering why I just kept=\r\n quiet in spite of her insistence, she begged and so I applied &#39;the vib=\r\nhuti&#39;. The next day, the child died.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bo=\r\nld&quot;&gt;Nayana used to tell all devotees, &#39;Do not allow children to be touc=\r\nhed by Bhagavan. If you do, He will liberate them at once!&#39; &quot;&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;But a slender hope lurked in Mahalakshmi Amma, who had boundles=\r\ns faith in and devotion to Bhagavan. She hoped that the child might, by Bha=\r\ngavan&#39;s Grace, come back to life. Those were the days, when orthodoxy r=\r\neigned supreme and orthodox rules forbade her to bring the lifeless body of=\r\n the child into the presence of Bhagavan Ramana, although her maternal hear=\r\nt yearned for His Grace.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;A little distance away from the path to t=\r\nhe &#39;gosala&#39; was a huge haystack. With great terpidation and hesitat=\r\nion, she brought the lifeless child and laid it on the ground by the haysta=\r\nck and waited with abundant hope for Bhagavan to pass by. Varanasi Subbalak=\r\nshmi Amma, who was by her side consoled her and gave moral support to the g=\r\nrieving mother.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When Bhagavan Ramana did come, Mahalakshmi was hes=\r\nitant to come near and prostrated from where she was. Bhagavan, the very em=\r\nbodiment of compassion, stopped and rested His eyes on the child with a lon=\r\ng look of grace. He stood in silence for sometime and proceeded on His way.=\r\n The desolate mother took in the situation and stood speechless. She resign=\r\ned herself to her &#39;prarabdha&#39; from which she realized that there wa=\r\ns no escape. Next day, they bathed the child and adorned it with garlands f=\r\nrom the Matrubhuteswara Temple. Later that morning, they buried the child.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;They then packed for the trip home. Their traits was leaving at 9 =\r\np.m. and at 2 p.m. they came into the presence of Bhagavan Ramana, in the J=\r\nubilee Hall in order to take leave of Him and avoid the crowd which would g=\r\nather around for Vedaparayanam in the evening. As if to do away with their =\r\ngrief, the divine will prompted a devotee to pose certain questions to Bhag=\r\navan Ramana, the answers to which brought soothing comfort to the sorrow st=\r\nricken parentss and lifted them from their despondency. Bhagavan&#39;s resp=\r\nonses gave them courage and fortitude and made them feel consoled at the th=\r\nought that, as the child had given up his body in the Holy Abode of Bhagava=\r\nn, hsi short prarabdha had been spent, he must have attained a high state o=\r\nf being in his spiritual evolution.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:ital=\r\nic&quot;&gt;Early next morning, when Bhagavan Ramana enquired where the child had b=\r\neen buried, he was told, &#39;Somewhere outside.&#39; Bhagavan Ramana remar=\r\nked, &quot;This child could have been buried here, but if that had been don=\r\ne, this place would become a general burial ground.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When I (=\r\nKanakammal) narrated His comment to Mahalakshmi, during her next visit, she=\r\n felt tremoundously comforted and said: &quot;The child&#39;s spiritual fut=\r\nure has been assured!&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mallikarjuna Rao, was a tall, hef=\r\nty and robust looking.Mahalakshmi was tall as well, but slim and delicate. =\r\nHer frail frame belied her mental fortitude, resoluteness and indomitable i=\r\nnner strength. She wore a sari in the Andhra Brahmin style, and like Suri N=\r\nagamma, was endowed with luxuriant, long, dark hair. But she lived an auste=\r\nre and orthodox life with self imposed rules of physical and mental discipl=\r\nine.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;She would get up at 3.30 am everyday a=\r\nnd after a bath,engage herself in puja and parayana and reciting her favour=\r\nite book, Grantha Mala (The Complete Works of Bhagavan, in Telugu). Her maj=\r\nor occupation during the day was telling the beads of a mala (rosary) with =\r\nBhagavan&#39;s name. Even while engaged in household work, like cutting veg=\r\netables, or cooking, she would be speaking mentally to Bhagavan, saying, &q=\r\nuot; Bhagavan!I am making such and such vegetable today, as per your comman=\r\nd.&quot; Thus with her mind focussed on Bhagavan and with all her constant =\r\nthoughts and actions centred on Bhagavan, she created an atmosphere permeat=\r\ned with the presence of Bhagavan and revelled in it, wherever she was.&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Mahalakshmi Amma, had a large family to attend to and whilst do=\r\ning so she had the habit of executing all the household work as though comm=\r\nanded by Bhagavan Ramana. Whatever was cooked, was eaten only after being o=\r\nffered to Bhagavan. While, eating, whether at home or outside, she observed=\r\n silence. Even in the Asramam, due her strict adherence to orthodox rules, =\r\nshe used to dine in the kitchen with the=C2=A0permission of the Asrmam mana=\r\ngement.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;When coming for lunch,she would bri=\r\nng three small bowls in a bag. Receiving a small quantity of side dishes in=\r\n the bowls and rice on a leaf plate, she would never acccept a second helpi=\r\nng. Even the served food she ate only after offering it to Bhagavan Ramana.=\r\n She was to be found at all other times to remain in dhyana in Bhagavan&#39=\r\n;s Hall. Even after the traged narrated above, the couple with their other =\r\nchildren frequently visited the Asramam.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-style:italic&quot;&gt;The entire family came to the Asramam for the &#39;kumbhabh=\r\nisekham of the Matrubhuteswara Temple. The children, especially the older o=\r\nnes who had for some time not had the opportunity to sit with Bhagavan duri=\r\nng lunch, longed to sit beside Him. The day of their return home was fast a=\r\npproaching. One day, Mahalakshmi Amma managed to bring all of them just in =\r\ntime for lunch. Somehow she managed to find places for everyone except for =\r\nherself and the eldest daughter, who was very disappointed as she was unsur=\r\ne whether she would accompany her parents the next time. Both stood at the =\r\nthreshold of the dining hall from where they feasted their eyes on Bhagavan=\r\n. When lunch had been completely served to everyone, Bhagavan usually signa=\r\nlled its start by nodding His head. But this time, He looked to His left an=\r\nd right, told someone to lay two more leaves, between Him and the entrance =\r\nof the kitchen and asked Mahalakshmi and her daughter to seat themselves be=\r\nfore these leaves.He waited until they had been served and only then nodded=\r\n, signalling the start of the lunch. As their leaves were so near Bhagavan&=\r\n#39;s leaf, with great reverence mingled with awe, they took the greatest c=\r\nare not to scatter any rice out of the leaves.They ate happily, enjoying th=\r\ne meal and the profound grace of Bhagavan. They respectfully waited until B=\r\nhagavan finished His food. Mahalakshmi often recalled this incident with te=\r\nars, gratefully saying how fortunate their family was to be blessed by Bhag=\r\navan again and again.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When they heard of the impending oper=\r\nation on Bhagavan for the cancerous growth, they immediately travelled to t=\r\nhe Asramam.A throng of people had gathered, however, darsan for that day wa=\r\ns over. Early next morning, Mahalakshmi arrived at the Asramam and sat at t=\r\nhe entrance of the Mother&#39;s Temple, in front of the closed doors behind=\r\n which Bhagavan Ramana was resting. As she was telling her beads, suddenly =\r\nthe doors opened and Bhagavan emerged.Looking at her, Bhagavan said, &quot;=\r\nUm...Um...&quot;, acknoweldged her presence and walked to the now Mahanirva=\r\nna Room. That every afternoon, darsan re-commenced and they returned home a=\r\nfter jointly seeing Bhagavan!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Lat=\r\ner, when Bhagavan&#39;s health had deteriorated very badly, they were unabl=\r\ne to stay away and returned again to the Asramam, which was now swarming wi=\r\nth people. Mahalakshmi had brought with her a new towel, some raisins and s=\r\nugar cubes.She stood opposite the Mother&#39;s Temple and looked towards th=\r\ne Nirvana Room.Her one longing was to preserve these items as relics, after=\r\n wiping the feet of Bhagavan with the towel and after a simple glance at th=\r\ne raisins and sugar cubes by Him.Tears were streaming down her cheeks.Bhaga=\r\nvan the living embodiment of compassion, sent a Telugu-speaking gentleman t=\r\no find out what she wanted. When she disclosed her desire, the gentleman ta=\r\nking the articles with Him, informed Bhagavan of her desire. Then Bhagavan,=\r\n the ocean of grace, stretched His feet so that he would wipe both His feet=\r\n with that towel. Bhagavan, who could now eat practically nothing, ate a fe=\r\nw of the raisins. When all the three items were returned to her, Mahalakshm=\r\ni Amma was overwhelmed by great joy and profound grief at the same time. Sh=\r\ne preserved these items as most precious relics in her puja room and worshi=\r\npped them till the end of her life.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Such a tranquil life, p=\r\noised in joy and serenity, was now buffeted by storms. Misfortunes befell,s=\r\ntarting with the Mahasamadhi of Bhagavan.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:b=\r\nold&quot;&gt;Soon aferwards, Mallikarjuna passed away.&lt;/span&gt;In the absence of a co=\r\nmpetent person to conduct the family business it soon fell into decline. Th=\r\neir affluence faded.With only two daughters married, the entire responsibil=\r\nty of marrying the other two daughters, had to be borne by her, though she =\r\nwas assisted by her elder son-in-law.Caught as she was in the tribulations =\r\nof supporting her family, her visits to the Asramam became few and far betw=\r\neen.But her inner poise and serenity remained untouched. At last, when all =\r\nresponsibilities had been discharged by the grace of Bhagavan, she resumed =\r\nher visits to the Asramam.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Though her=\r\n husband had bought a huge plot of land on which to build a house, for vari=\r\nous reasons this did not materialize, so she rented a room.Now she further =\r\ntightened her self-imposed disciplinary rules.She at only what she had cook=\r\ned for herself -- a simple lunch in the afternoon and a light meal at night=\r\n.&lt;/span&gt;It was a spartan life, given wholly to devotional practice and dhya=\r\nna.With no more responsibilities weighing her down, she was like a bird rel=\r\neased from its cage. Unattached, independent, highly dispassionate, and bea=\r\nming with joy, her life reflected her inner peace.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Once she arrived back at the Asramam, after a long time.T=\r\nhere was a noticeable difference in her appearance.With the loss of her hus=\r\nband, she had adoped the attire of a widow, white saris with a small colour=\r\ned border at the bottom. But now her long hair was gone and she was dressed=\r\n in the strict orthodox garb of a widow -- we saw a plain white sari with s=\r\nhaven head.The only ornaments were a &#39;rudraksha mala&#39; and a &#39;sp=\r\natika mala&#39;.She looked the picture renunciation.I asked her why she had=\r\n resorted to such an extreme step of self-abnegation.She explained what had=\r\n happened.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When things took a turn for the worse, she had needed s=\r\npiritual reassurance to steady her inner peace which was seriously threaten=\r\ned.The Paramacharya of Kanchipuram [Sri Chandrasekhara Saraswati Swamigal] =\r\nand Abinave Vidya Teertha of Sringeri Math,were both then touring Andhra Pr=\r\nadesh separately, camping at various places. The high esteem in which she h=\r\nad held the revered Acharya of Kanchi Kamakoti Math made her decide to meet=\r\n him, but strict orthodoxy stood in her way.Brahmin widows with unshaven he=\r\nads [in those days] could view him only from a distance. To have a private =\r\naudience with him or to get the &#39;prasad&#39; of holy water from him, sh=\r\ne had to shave her head. The prospect of distant darsan did not satisfy her=\r\n.Her tenacity of purpose and her eagerness not to let the opportuntiy slip =\r\naway, decided the issue. Her hair, that was till luxuriant, was cut off and=\r\n her head shaved.Now she sought and got the longed-for private interview wi=\r\nth the Sage.The outcome was very positive. Her inner poise was restored and=\r\n she followed him thorughout his tour in Andhra.Thus reassured she was at p=\r\neace as never before, with all the composure of still waters.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;When she became old, she could not come to the Asramam, as before and it=\r\n was through one of her daughters who came occasianally that I [Smt. Kanaka=\r\nmmal ] got news of her. After sometime I heard of her passing away. The adv=\r\nersities she had faced after the demise of her husband were innumerable. Bu=\r\nt she had faced them with equqnimity. Because her heart was family anchored=\r\n at Bhagavan Ramana&#39;s feet, she emerged victorious from all struggles, =\r\nwith her inner calm unruffled.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Thus ended the inspiring life of a =\r\npure and holy devotee who had to wage a heroic battle with life, armed sole=\r\nly with the weapon of pure devotion and the grace of Bhagavan Ramana and th=\r\ne kingdom of peace was her gain. This echoes what the Lord said in Srimad B=\r\nhagavatam, in Skandam 10, Chapter 88, Versses 8-9:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The meaning of =\r\nwhich is:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;He on whom I am going to bestow My Grace, I solemnly=\r\n deprive of him of all his wealth. When his wealth has gone, all his friend=\r\ns,his kith and kin will desert him, making him sink into the utmost sorrow =\r\nand despair. When his further efforts to gain wealth also fail, thanks to M=\r\ny will, he becomes filled with dispassion and becomes&lt;br&gt;\n\nassociated with =\r\nMy devotees. On such a one, I bestow My Grace.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The story of Mahalakshmi Amma illustrates that a househol=\r\nder, amidst the constant demands of family duty and the call of multifariou=\r\ns responsibilities, through steadfast devotion to her guru, can rise higher=\r\n in esteem and greateness that ordinary ascetics and renunciates.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: Smt.
