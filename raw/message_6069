After we come more closer we s=\r\nee only that facet and not whole diamond\n\nNext stage (of seeing as protons/=\r\nneutrons etc) is like entering the diamond and getting assimilated in the d=\r\niamond matter itself. We realise that all facets are same from inside and a=\r\nre made of same matter.\n\nDeep Regards\nwith grace of Lord Krishna :)\n\n\n--- I=\r\nn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr. A.

But I feel that these two are different a=\r\nnd co-existing properties of God.\n&gt; \n&gt; When we talk about a coin. we say th=\r\nat this is a coin of such and such denomination. It has a head and tail. wh=\r\nen we go deeper we get to know that coin is all made of nickel. it is insig=\r\nnificant to know whether it has head or tail. important is that it is all n=\r\nickel. When we go further deep we realise that there is nothing but protons=\r\n and electrons and neutrons. And these are the same protons/electrons and n=\r\neutrons which make whole universe.\n&gt; \n&gt; When we think as head and tail, at =\r\nthis stage we are just introduced to a deity. We see His form keep faith on=\r\n His form. When we go deeper we realise that This deity fills whole univers=\r\ne and this whole universe is accomodated by the deity. This stage resembles=\r\n to the stage where we see coin as a piece of nickel. When we further go de=\r\neper, we realise that the deity is nothing but manifestation of that nirvik=\r\nar brahma. And this Nirvikar brahma is the one who fills all the universe a=\r\nnd all the deities are manifestation of that Nirvikar brahma alone. At this=\r\n stage one understand that there is no difference between these deities.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; You can think of different deities as coins of different currencies/coun=\r\ntries. Coin of any country can be used to buy clothes/food etc and all of t=\r\nhem are as valuable. all of them are made of different alloys/metals. But a=\r\nll of them are made of same protons/electrons and neutrons.\n&gt; \n&gt; These thre=\r\ne different properties are not same contradicting properties. But they are =\r\nall three different properties. Same coin have head and tail. Same coin is =\r\nmade of nickel and same coin is made of neutrons etc. So these are not conf=\r\nusing but well explaining I think.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry if I confused you further. I =\r\nusually do so. In short I can say that Duality and Non-duality these should=\r\n not be confused as contradictory. but they are two different properties of=\r\n same god.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for the mistakes\n&gt; \n&gt; Deep regards\n&gt; with the grace o=\r\nf Lord krishna\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; =\r\n&lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste T,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is confusing !\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;Which is why, I understand only duality to follow :-)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You removed=\r\n your confusion by writing last statement :-).\n&gt; &gt; It is all duality and on=\r\nly duality till there is an experience of oneness...even if a small tiny on=\r\ne.
