Do not worry. It is not uncommon in\nTulasi maalas to have cracks.\n\n&gt; I have heard best place to keep mala while doing Japa is near  the\n&gt; heart, at least always above navel, is that correct?\n\nYes. Keeping the current meditating bead of the maalaa close to the anaahata\nchakra is a good idea.\n\nMooladhara, svadhishthana and manipoora chakras are the bhur, bhuvar and\nsuvar lokas, which exist physically. Above navel are the lokas that do not\nexist physically and exist only spiritually. The goal of sadhana is, if not\nto get moksha, to go to a higher spiritual loka. Keeping the bead above\nnavel is a good idea.\n\n&gt; Lastly, I distinctly notice feelings of anger after doing Japa?I have\n&gt; just started doing Japa as a remedy, is this anger residue some kind\n&gt; of by product of the purification process? The mantra is a very\n&gt; common, Prasiddha Vishnu Mantra.\n\nPossible. Certain prior vasanas and karamas need to be washed away or burned\nin sadhana in order to progress. When a room is being swept by a broom, some\ndirt may spill over at its door. Have patience and surrender to the Lord.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; Thank you!\n&gt;\n&gt; Will try with the Tulsi Mala.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sorry to get so technical but the Tulsi mala I have seems to be\n&gt; cracked in many places, is this is ok?

If this specific pre-occupation minimized many other (and\n&gt; worse)\n&gt;&gt; pre-occupations, it is not a bad thing at all.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is like a monkey that keeps jumping from one place to another\n&gt; place being\n&gt;&gt; tied to a pole with a chain to limit its jumping. The monkey may\n&gt; still be\n&gt;&gt; jumping up and down, but the chain atleast *limits* its movement\n&gt; around one\n&gt;&gt; pole.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Of course, if the monkey learns to stay in one place without\n&gt; jumping, it\n&gt;&gt; needs no chain or pole anymore. Chain was there in the first place\n&gt; to limit\n&gt;&gt; its jumping.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Each person is the best judge of where one is and what is\n&gt; appropriate for\n&gt;&gt; oneself. We make progress by recognizing our weaknesses and\n&gt; addressing them.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In addition, there are certain chakras in the tips of fingers that are\n&gt;&gt; directly connected to the brain. Objects like rudraksha and tulasi\n&gt; beads can\n&gt;&gt; stimulate those minor energy centers. Thus, there is *some* use in the\n&gt;&gt; beginning.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 1. Does Japa have to be done with a Mala?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Upto you. For most people, I recommend using a maalaa.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 1. What are the ramifications of crossing the Meru bead?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; What use is it to know? Avoid it as much as you can. If you cross\n&gt; it, so be\n&gt;&gt; it. Don&#39;t worry and move on. But, avoid crossing it again.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I know some scriptures say Japa done with Mala (in my case Vishnu\n&gt;&gt; &gt; mantra done with Tulsi Mala) is more effective then japa done without\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mala.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 2. Is this meant to be taken seriously?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It is also given in a scripture that Rudraksha and Tulasi maalaas\n&gt; can be\n&gt;&gt; used for chanting any mantra and they are many more times powerful than\n&gt;&gt; other maalaas. My suggestion is to pick up either a Rudraksha maalaa\n&gt; or a\n&gt;&gt; Tulasi maalaa based on your taste and use it for *all* mantras.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I want to categorically state that using a Tulasi maalaa for Shiva or a\n&gt;&gt; Rudraksha maalaa for Vishnu will NOT do you any harm.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 3. What should one concentrate when reciting Japa for purpose of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; remedial measures? The mantra, the devata, one&#39;s goals?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Anything that works as an anchor to limit the mind from straying\n&gt; away too\n&gt;&gt; much is useful. An image or visualization of deity may work for some.\n&gt;&gt; Focussing on each sound and ups and downs in intonation may work for\n&gt; some.\n&gt;&gt; The goal is to minimize other thoughts. Thinking of one&#39;s goals will\n&gt; usually\n&gt;&gt; make the mind stray away into unnecessary pre-occupations. It is\n&gt; better to\n&gt;&gt; focus on deity or mantra.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;sbm_sharma&quot; &lt;sbm_sharma@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, December 13, 2008 11:59 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Mala For Japa?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hello,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; This is my first post.
