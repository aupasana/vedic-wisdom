In the beginning, I i=\r\nntend to do it every Saturday. I will start with the MahaGanapathy homam, a=\r\nnd then let MahaGanapathy guide me along the path, as you have said many ti=\r\nmes. Shrimaan, I was thinking of starting from the beginning of the New Yea=\r\nr in Chaitra Masa, which happens on March 23rd this year. The very auspicio=\r\nus Vasant/Chaitra Navaratri also starts the same day. I was thinking of sta=\r\nrting from either Chaitra Pratipada - March 23rd, Shukravara or Chaitra Dvi=\r\ntiya -March 24th, Shanivara. Do you reckon this to be a good time to start =\r\nthe homam? and which is a better day - Chaitra Pratipada, Shukravara or Cha=\r\nitra Dvitiya, Shanivara? \n&gt; \n&gt; I look forward to your guidance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks=\r\n and best regards,\n&gt; Manish\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
