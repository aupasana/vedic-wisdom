At the sam=\r\ne time, some not-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine pres=\r\nence.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I was very impressed with the=C2=A0Krishna temple in M=\r\nayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachal=\r\nam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous=\r\n amount of spiritual energy in those places. There are several temples wher=\r\ne the idol is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakris=\r\nhna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not=\r\n get the same impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Cal=\r\ncutta.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was t=\r\naken to by a priest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Na=\r\ndu before we did the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard o=\r\nf that temple before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the=C2=\r\n=A0form of the divine Mother=C2=A0present there was a Tamil language name a=\r\nnd I did not understand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when =\r\nI closed my eyes and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol=\r\n, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting=\r\n rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunat=\r\nely, I do not remember the name of the place or the goddess, but it is a te=\r\nmple without roof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof over the godde=\r\nss a few times, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and the=\r\ny finally decided that the goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we sp=\r\nent only 5 min and left\n&gt; &gt;  in a hurry, I was very pleased with that templ=\r\ne. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name of the temple and goddes=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Like this, I am sure there are many temples with a powerf=\r\nul divine presence across India.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Apart from the Kaali temple=\r\n at Dakshineshwar, one of my best experiences when meditating was at the Kr=\r\nishna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Mahara=\r\nj is still meditating in the underground chamber there.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Even the middle of a busy road in India is bette=\r\nr for meditating than a temple in USA. These western countries are so fille=\r\nd with rajas and tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a good am=\r\nount of sattwa there. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to med=\r\nitate, but my view is that there is not much left at *some* temples. But so=\r\nme temples are really good.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; If one has a chance to spend a f=\r\new months doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurt=\r\naalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills)=C2=A0and Narayana=C2=A0vanam (nea=\r\nr Tirupati)=C2=A0in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka=C2=A0and Girnar m=\r\nountains (Junagadh) in west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in no=\r\nrth India and Srisailam and Mantralayam=C2=A0and Ujjain in central India.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; There are many other good places, but the above come to my mi=\r\nnd. Visiting a temple once is one thing and staying there for several month=\r\ns while maintaining a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like =\r\nhomam or japam) there is quite another.\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Na=\r\nrasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n---------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ h=\r\nomam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpa=\r\nna\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free=\r\n Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyoti=\r\nsh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings=\r\n: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre=\r\n (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Origina=\r\nl Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: Astro Seeker \n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups.=\r\n com \n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Holy Places\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Respected Narsimhaji, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I would like to know your opinion on holy places (famous temples et=\r\nc) in today&#39;s time.
