One may think &quot;nothing\nreally exists apart from Bra=\r\nhman - all this I am perceiving is a\ndelusion&quot;. Another may think &quot;all I pe=\r\nrceive is actually Brahman&quot;.\nAnother may think &quot;all that I perceive is actu=\r\nally a minute part of\nKrishna&quot;. And so on.

Please correct m=\r\ne if I am wrong in my\nunderstanding.=C2 =C2 And yet these three spiritual g=\r\naints have spoken\ndifferently of their realizations.

Then I wonder why =\r\nthese three people - saints of highest order\n- try to describe it when all =\r\ndescriptions are from within duality...\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Considering the above, I un=\r\nderstand the wisdom (theoritically) of why\nRamakrishna refused to describe =\r\nNirvikalpa Samadhi.=C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; I also wonder whether=C2 the three saints, S=\r\nri Ramana Maharishi, Sri\nAurobindo and Lord Buddha were speaking from teh s=\r\name realization of=C2\nthe One/Truth, or was it different kinds of realizati=\r\nons.

What we are talking about here is the absence of observer, i.e. me=\r\nrging of observer, observed and the act of observing into one, without ANY =\r\ndistinction whatsoever between them. Is &quot;void&quot; the right word to describe t=\r\nhat state or is &quot;everything&quot; the right word? Is there a good way to describ=\r\ne it? Problem is that the word &quot;void&quot; may make people imagine a scenario wh=\r\nere there is an observer, but a void to observe.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nBest regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, F=\r\nree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manu=\r\nals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=\r\n=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2=\r\n&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp; Films that make a diff=\r\nerence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;=C2&n=\r\nbsp; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&n=\r\nbsp; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; -------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Tue, 12/29/09, rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@... wr=\r\note:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [vedi=\r\nc-wisdom] Samadhi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Tu=\r\nesday, December 29, 2009, 1:27 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I understand the example given in that superb mail, yet some =\r\nconfusion exist (in my understanding) .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; See, Sri =\r\nRamakrishna, when he was asked about Nirvikalpa Samadhi said he cannot desc=\r\nribe it in words like the salt doll example provided by Hari. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; After all, Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadant=\r\ni&quot;, which means&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Truth is One, but the learned call differentl=\r\ny&quot; . &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; True. Now I see this line in different ways=\r\n - 1) As different saints have mentioned different sadhanas/paths to achiev=\r\ne God. 2) Secondly as you mentioned, that Truth is One, but saints call it =\r\ndifferently.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From=C2&nbsp;from the diamond analog=\r\ny I understand that if=C2&nbsp;X reaches a certain face of the diamond and =\r\nY reaches another face of the diamond, they percieve it differently, though=\r\nt both faces are the same diamond, just different aspects. This is OK. This=\r\n can be equal to savikalpa samadhi and may be experienced differently depen=\r\nding upon the individual.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Now&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; As you break through any face of the diamond&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and j=\r\nump into the interior of the diamond, you no longer perceive the faces=C2&n=\r\nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of the diamond or the world outside. There are no longer=\r\n any objects or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; attributes.=C2&nbsp; There is no I-ness or It=\r\n-ness or experience. The experiencer, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; experienced and experie=\r\nnce all merge into one.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) This seems logical and=\r\n is also the main cause of my confusion. When=C2&nbsp;we say that we enter =\r\nthe middle of the diamond, when duality is no more, then how can it=C2&nbsp=\r\n;be experienced differently by different people? Shouldn&#39;t it be=C2&nbsp; t=\r\nhe same? I thought, whichever face of teh diamond you chose as your entry p=\r\noint, the middle of teh diamond should feel and look exactly similar. Pleas=\r\ne correct me if I am wrong in my understanding.=C2&nbsp;=C2&nbsp;And yet th=\r\nese three spiritual gaints have spoken differently of their realizations. I=\r\nf duality itself does not exist, then how can the field of possiblity at al=\r\nl arise? Which means, how can there be a difference in the &quot;perception&quot; of =\r\nthe same One final Truth?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) Not to mention the q=\r\nuery about whether, that which is transcendental in its basic nature (Truth=\r\n/One/Middle of the diamond),=C2&nbsp;can=C2&nbsp;at all be=C2&nbsp;describe=\r\nd from within the field of duality? Then I wonder why these three people - =\r\nsaints of highest order - try to describe it when all descriptions are from=\r\n within duality...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Considering the above, I under=\r\nstand the wisdom (theoritically) of why Ramakrishna refused to describe Nir=\r\nvikalpa Samadhi.=C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I also wonder whether=\r\n=C2&nbsp;the three saints, Sri Ramana Maharishi, Sri Aurobindo and Lord Bud=\r\ndha were speaking from teh same realization of=C2&nbsp;the One/Truth, or wa=\r\ns it different kinds of realizations. By this I mean, can it be possible th=\r\nat there are different intermediate or not properly documented stages of sa=\r\nmadhi apart from the standard=C2&nbsp;savikalpa/nirvikalp a/sajaha?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; PS: I can understand that maybe Buddha did not mention a=\r\n void per se, he probably mentioned that there is nothing - for lack of any=\r\n better words -=C2&nbsp;and stopped further discussion. Over years his word=\r\ns could have=C2&nbsp;got corrupted to some degree and people mistook it to =\r\nmean Buddha was saying there is a void. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; . . .&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness=\r\n) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Tue, 29/12/09, Kishore =\r\nChitrapu chitrapu@gmail. com&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Kishore Chitrapu chit=\r\nrapu@gmail. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Samadhi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To:=\r\n vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Tuesday, 29 December, 2009, 9=\r\n:00 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C2&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namas=\r\nte Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The bright star in the sky analogy that Naras=\r\nimha posted (http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 83) may=\r\n answer your questions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Few excerpts of that mail:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; After all, Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti&quot;, which mea=\r\nns&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Truth is One, but the learned call differently&quot; . &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n . . .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As you break through any face of the diamond&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; and jump into the interior of the diamond, you no longer percei=\r\nve the faces=C2&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of the diamond or the world outside.
