Only very higher level beings can \nattain the same. Since the topic of=\r\n siddhis did come up, Vimalananda&#39;s ability \nto suck up a ton of mercury by=\r\n Vajroli and bring it out from his hair infront of \nsomeone of Vishudhanand=\r\na&#39;s spiritual calibre, is not a easy feat. This is not a \nrun-of-the-mill s=\r\niddhi. \n\n=C2=A0 \n3) I never compared Vimalananda with Ramakrishna, but with=\r\n Ramakrishna&#39;s \ndisciples. That is a crucial difference.=C2=A0 My compariso=\r\nns are always based NOT on \nmy understanding, but clear words of great spir=\r\nitual people. That is why I am \n100 perecent clear that Ramakrishna is spir=\r\nitually higher than a Vivekananada or \nan Abhedananda. You may not want to =\r\njudge them., thats your point of view. I on \nthe other hand would rather re=\r\nly on the clear words of Vivekananda and \nAbhedananda on this matter rather=\r\n than speculation. Both Vivekananda and \nAbhedananda used to say Ramakrishn=\r\na is their Guru and spiritually far higher \nthan they were. \n\n=C2=A0 \n4) Wh=\r\nether Ramakrishna was a paramhamsa or a siddha in Vimalananda&#39;s scale is \nm=\r\nerely your speculation. Vimalananda&#39;s books however betray no such speculat=\r\nion. \nI would rather rely on the words of the book. \n\n=C2=A0 \n5) In this ag=\r\ne everyone likes to take a title for himself. Many spiritual people \nname t=\r\nhemselves Rishis, and we know it they are not.=C2=A0 So the Nityananda \ncom=\r\nparison does not stand. Vimalananda on his part never used any titles, not =\r\n\neven the term Guru. I base my judgement of this man on a) critical study o=\r\nf the \nbooks b) Manish&#39;s words. And I have not found you giving any sound l=\r\nogic for why \nI should change the same. \n\n=C2=A0 \n6) If you do not want to =\r\ncompare spiritual people, that is perfectly fine. I or \nanyone else is not =\r\nforcing you. However, that does not mean the world will not \ndo so, special=\r\nly when the great spiritual people themselves have clearly done so \non diff=\r\nerent occassions.

This is a delicate area where many have \nmisconcep=\r\ntions and I will try to address them. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nM=\r\naharshi Vasishtha&#39;s teaching to Lord Rama is clear in Yoga Vaasishtham. The=\r\n \ngoal of existence and sadhana is self-realization. Siddhis are to be neit=\r\nher \nspecifically sought nor specifically avoided, by a seeker of Self. If =\r\nNature \ngives one some siddhi(s), one should accept them with neither excit=\r\nement nor \ndisappointment. But one should NOT run after them, for they are =\r\nneither \nnecessary nor sufficient for self-realization and liberation. \n\n=\r\n=C2=A0 \nVivekananda used the same principle when Ramakirishna proposed to g=\r\nive his \nsiddhis to Vivekananda. He asked whether the siddhis will enable h=\r\nim to realize \ngod. Ramakrishna said no. Vivekananda firmly declined the of=\r\nfer then! Of course, \nwhen Ramakrishna gave them anyway later, he accepted =\r\nthem. Vivekananda&#39;s two \nactions demonstrate Vasishtha&#39;s instructions well.=\r\n \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nLet us use the analogy of climbing a hi=\r\nll. Climbing hill is one&#39;s spiritual \nsadhana. Reaching the top is liberati=\r\non. Different people climb the hill from \ndifferent sides and using differe=\r\nnt paths. There may be trees with nice fruits \non the sides of the road. Th=\r\ney are siddhis or special abilities. \n\n=C2=A0 \nIf one gets distracted, star=\r\nts climbing the trees and collecting fruits, one&#39;s \njourney gets delayed an=\r\nd one may not reach the top. That is why Vasishtha says a \nseeker of Self d=\r\noes not pursue any siddhis. \n\n=C2=A0 \nBut if some fruits fall in one&#39;s lap =\r\nby themselves, one can keep them. \nSimilarly, siddhis that come to one by t=\r\nhemselves can be accepted by a seeker of \nSelf. \n\n=C2=A0 \nNow an important =\r\ndistinction: \n=C2=A0 \nThere are some trees that are found at lower altitude=\r\ns also, but some really \nspecial trees are found at very high altitudes onl=\r\ny. If one has such a fruit, it \nshows that one has climbed great heights. S=\r\nimilarly, some siddhis do not mean \nmuch, but some siddhis are very special=\r\n and only really elevated sadhakas can \nobtain them (whether by trying or w=\r\nithout trying). If a sadhakas demonstrates \nsuch a siddhi, you can see that=\r\n one progressed a lot. However, the key is that \none who climbed the same o=\r\nr more distance may not have that or any other fruit. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nUnlike in the example of climbing hill, which is an external=\r\n activity, spiritual \nprogress in real life is *internal*. There is NO way =\r\nfor anyone to know for sure \nhow much progress one has made, how much self-=\r\ncontrol one has internally and \nwhat exactly goes on in one&#39;s mind. We may =\r\ntry to judge it from external factors \nsuch as actions, words etc, but it i=\r\ns not necessarily accurate. \n\n=C2=A0 \nHere, some people swayed by siddhis m=\r\nay be tempted to use one&#39;s siddhis to judge \nhow high one climbed. But that=\r\n is faulty. One person who reached the absolute \ntop may not have any fruit=\r\ns, while one person who still has ways to climb may \nhave gotten some reall=\r\ny nice fruit. Using externaslly demonstrable siddhis that \nare neither nece=\r\nssary nor sufficient for Self-realization as a measure of one&#39;s \nprogress i=\r\ns unsound. \n\n=C2=A0 \nGiven that spiritual progress is internal, how can we =\r\njudge it and compare \npeople then? Well, we need not and should not. Only a=\r\n sarvaantaryaami - a \nperfected being who has access to each being&#39;s intern=\r\nal state - can do that. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nRajarshi, you ar=\r\ne assuming that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is a Paramahamsa on \nVimalananda&#39;s =\r\nscale. You are concluding that Ramakrishna is a Paramahamsa; \nAbhedananda, =\r\nVivekananda etc are lower than that; Vimalananda is a rishi; and \nhence Vim=\r\nalananda is superior to Abhedananda and Vivekananda by 2pwr16 to 2. \n\n=C2=\r\n=A0 \nIs Paramahamsa Nithyananda, who was caught in a sex scandal, also a Pa=\r\nramahamsa \nbecause he is known so? See, how people are famously known may o=\r\nr may not \nreflect their spiritual stature. Real spiritual stature is inter=\r\nnal and you \ncannot see it. \n\n=C2=A0 \nWe do not know who Ramakrishna Parama=\r\nhamsa really is. He may not be just a \nparamahamsa on Vimalananda&#39;s scale, =\r\nbut be a siddha or a natha or even a rishi. \nHe may even be Vishnu himself,=\r\n as he himself said and some religious experts of \nthat time declared based=\r\n on various signs. If Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is Vishnu \nhimself, Vivekanan=\r\nda, Abhedananda etc can definitely be rishis or naths in \nVimalananda&#39;s sca=\r\nle. If your argument is that they cannot be because they did \nnot demonstra=\r\nte siddhis compatible with that status, that is a non-point as I \nexplained=\r\n above. The disagreement between then boils down a difference in the \nrelev=\r\nance and importance of externally demonstrated siddhis. \n\n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nWhy this is relevant and I spent some time on this is tha=\r\nt some people seem to \nhave misconceptions.

Ple=\r\nase read what he taught \nLord Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is the essence o=\r\nf Veda and Upanishad. It will \nbalance your views and mould your attitude. =\r\nRead Yoga Vaasishtham. Siddhis are \nneither necessary nor sufficient for se=\r\nlf-realization. Don&#39;t be distracted by \nthem or be infatuated with them. \n\n=\r\n=C2=A0 \nThe goal of sadhana is that your notions of &quot;this is I and these ar=\r\ne mine&quot; get \nsubtler and subtler and hold of six internal enemies on you be=\r\ncomes weaker and \nweaker. Others may or may not be able to see and judge yo=\r\nur progress, but you \nknow your progress and weaknesses the best. THAT is t=\r\nhe crux and siddhis have no \nrelevance or meaning.

This came from the \n=\r\n&gt; context of Rajarshi&#39;s comments on the &quot;maturity&quot; & &quot;errors&quot; of \n&gt; Ramakri=\r\nshna&#39;s disciples (regarding their attitude towards Tantra). He \n&gt; compared =\r\nthem with Vimalananda and said their spiritual caliber was of \n&gt; the scale =\r\nof 2, while Vimalananda&#39;s was 2 power 16. He also talked about \n&gt; the hiera=\r\nrchy of spiritual caliber mentioned by V. I want to share 2 \n&gt; cents of mus=\r\nings on that. \n&gt; \n&gt; ------------------------------- \n&gt; Measuring Spiritual =\r\nCaliber \n&gt; \n&gt; Rajarshi, here are a few comments on your statements a couple=\r\n of days \n&gt; back on Twitter comparing spiritual caliber. We can&#39;t even comp=\r\nare \n&gt; flowers like hibiscus, rose, jasmine, mogra, kewda, lotus etc & say =\r\n\n&gt; which is a better flower. They have different properties like color, \n&gt; =\r\nsize, shape, number of petals, type/intensity of smell etc. Relative \n&gt; val=\r\nues depend on the purpose and they cannot be quantified universally. \n&gt; How=\r\n can any sane person then say that spiritual caliber of different \n&gt; people=\r\n can be compared and quanitified? The field of duality has \n&gt; infinite vari=\r\nety and the [self-]control of a yogi has infinite aspects \n&gt; to it. You can=\r\nnot quantify the spiritual caliber of a person as one \n&gt; number and compare=\r\n them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Before one even attempts to understand Vimalananda&#39;s order (Pa=\r\nramahamsa \n&gt; &lt; Siddha &lt; Natha &lt; Rishi), please note that different hierarch=\r\nies exist \n&gt; in scriptures for deities also. Some consider a hierarchy of d=\r\neities \n&gt; where Vishnu is supreme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities whe=\r\nre \n&gt; Shiva is supreme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where Shakti i=\r\ns \n&gt; supreme. And so on. None of them is absolute. All of them are relative=\r\n \n&gt; and for specific purposes, i.e. from a specific perspective. There are =\r\n\n&gt; people who take them as absolute and argue that so and so thing taught \n=\r\n&gt; by Vishnu is superior to so and so thing taught by Shiva, etc. But we \n&gt; =\r\nknow that none of the hierarchies is absolute. \n&gt; \n&gt; One who has the nerve =\r\nto think that one can compare the wisdom of \n&gt; Jnaneshwar, dispassion of Ra=\r\nmana Maharshi, mad devotion of Ramakrishna \n&gt; Paramahamsa, detached activis=\r\nm of Vivekananda, compassion of Shirdi Sai, \n&gt; spiritual ecstasy of Vama Kh=\r\nepa, inner clarity of Lahiri Mahashaya, \n&gt; detachment of Trilinga Swami, pu=\r\nrity of Tukaram, humility of Eknath \n&gt; Maharaj, ecstatic love of Meera Bai,=\r\n motherly love of Gopaler Ma, etc, \n&gt; is a fool of the highest order. They =\r\ncan be compared from specific \n&gt; limited perspectives. In one thing, Tukara=\r\nm may be superior to all, in \n&gt; another Jnaneshwar, in another Trilinga, in=\r\n another Ramakrishna, and so \n&gt; on. You cannot compare in absolute terms. Y=\r\nou should not even try to. \n&gt; You should just appreciate them individually =\r\nand aspire to be like any \n&gt; of them that you like the most. \n&gt; \n&gt; Vimalana=\r\nnda&#39;s list may be correct from specific perspective. More \n&gt; importantly, h=\r\nis words should make one realize that there is always \n&gt; scope for further =\r\nself-control (and the resulting mastery over the field \n&gt; of duality) while=\r\n one is still embodied. One should never rest and \n&gt; aspire for better self=\r\n-control. But taking it as gospel and starting to \n&gt; judge yogis based on t=\r\nhat is unwise. Especially making statements like \n&gt; &quot;Vimalananda is heavier=\r\n than all RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot; and thinking \n&gt; that something is absolu=\r\nte truth because Vimalananda is assumed to have \n&gt; said that (vs someone &quot;l=\r\nower than him&quot;) is unwise. \n&gt; \n&gt; Even if Vimalananda&#39;s hierarchy is absolut=\r\ne and universal, don&#39;t assume \n&gt; that you can judge the stature of each yog=\r\ni accurately. Because \n&gt; Ramakrishna was popularly known as a Paramahamsa, =\r\nis he a Paramahamsa as \n&gt; per Vimalananda&#39;s classification or a siddha or a=\r\n natha or even a rishi? \n&gt; Or may be a deity? My friend, don&#39;t assume you k=\r\nnow for sure!!! Based on \n&gt; the details we know, can we be absolutely sure =\r\nof even Vimalananda&#39;s \n&gt; stature based on his own classification? \n&gt; \n&gt; You=\r\n said &quot;Approximating 2 equal to each disciples of ramakrishna. 2exp16 \n&gt; =\r\n=3D say Vimalananda. Basic?&quot; You probably made this statement based on \n&gt; w=\r\nhat you read and heard of Vimalananda. For the sake of argument, it is \n&gt; n=\r\not even 100% clear whether he was a real person or an imagined \n&gt; character=\r\n. Svoboda intentionally (and very wisely!) left the latter \n&gt; option open i=\r\nn the preface of his Aghora book! \n&gt; \n&gt; If we MUST compare spiritual calibe=\r\nrs, one possibility is to use a \n&gt; simpler definition of how close one is t=\r\no liberation as a measure of \n&gt; one&#39;s &quot;spiritual caliber&quot;, Ramakrishna&#39;s di=\r\nsciples fare quite well. RK \n&gt; told Abhedananda that it was going to be his=\r\n last birth. Others would be \n&gt; back, but he would be liberated. To Yoganan=\r\nda, he said there would be \n&gt; one more birth and he would be free forever a=\r\nfter that. Vimalananda, on \n&gt; the other hand, had atleast one more birth cl=\r\nearly as he said a body was \n&gt; waiting for him. That way, forget about &quot;RK&#39;=\r\ns discples put togtr&quot;, just \n&gt; Abhedananda alone is superior to Vimalananda=\r\n! \n&gt; \n&gt; Again, please note that this is just one definition. One can have m=\r\nany \n&gt; definitions. The key is not to jump to unwise conclusions on any \n&gt; =\r\nhierarchies and say that &quot;X is weightier than Y and so what he said must \n&gt;=\r\n be more correct&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; People with lopsided understanding of scriptures t=\r\nake relative knowledge \n&gt; to be absolute and jump to unwise conclusions. I =\r\nam afraid some people \n&gt; are doing the same now with &quot;modern scriptures&quot; su=\r\nch as the Aghora \n&gt; books. Don&#39;t fall into the trap of taking something as =\r\ngospel or as \n&gt; absolute. Written words are always relative and never absol=\r\nute. \n&gt; Discriminate relative knowledge using intellect at first and hopefu=\r\nlly \n&gt; using experencial realization later on. \n&gt; \n&gt; More importantly, whil=\r\ne we are still searching for &quot;maturity&quot;, we should \n&gt; not commit the &quot;error=\r\n&quot; of making negative judgmental comments of greats \n&gt; who did far more sadh=\r\nana than us and experienced a lot more than us. \n&gt; ------------------------=\r\n------- \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards, \n&gt; Narasimha \n\nNow, Ramakrishna himself said th=\r\nat Vivekananda and six other sishyas were \n&quot;Ishwara Koti&quot; or &quot;Nitya Siddhas=\r\n&quot;. Can you tell me where this falls on \nVimalananda&#39;s scale? What do you th=\r\nink &quot;Nithya Siddha&quot; (nithya=3Deternal) means? \nIs it Siddha or Mahasiddha o=\r\nr even greater or in between? If six disciples were \n&quot;Nithya Siddhas&quot; and R=\r\namakrishna is &quot;greater&quot; as you say, can he be a \n&quot;Paramahamsa&quot; on this scal=\r\ne, i.e. lower than them?&gt;&gt;\n\nSimple! Ramakrishna says Vivekananda was a part=\r\n of a Rishi who came down. An \namsa is not a Rishi in fullforce, but suffic=\r\nient part of the Rishi&#39;s \nconsciousness that comes down for a secific purpo=\r\nse and once the purpose is \nserved, goes back to the source. Similar for=C2=\r\n=A0the 6 Nitya-Siddhas. Therefore, \nvery technically, Swami Vivekananda is =\r\nan *amsa* of a Rishi, a projection of a \nRishi. Not the Rishi is full. BTW,=\r\n all of these Siddhas, Naths, Munis etc are \nprojection Rishis one way or t=\r\nhe other. Each is kept is ingorance of their real \nbeing (Rishi) such that =\r\nthe play can go on (not my words, Vimalananda&#39;s words). \nThey are Nitya-sid=\r\ndha because even if they take birth over and over, being parts \nof extremel=\r\ny higher beings, these emanations/projections/amsas will surely \neventually=\r\n go back to the source when the work is done. \n\n\nHowever, in their forms as=\r\n specific individuals like Vivekananda, whether these \namsa attain the spec=\r\nific stages which makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi will \ndetermine if they ar=\r\ne to be called so. They may not need to do so since they are \nhere for a pu=\r\nrpose. But, the only way a person can be called a siddha in true \nsense is =\r\nwhen he, as Vimalananda puts it, &quot;picks a petal&quot;, (some specific \nshaktis)=\r\n=C2=A0an &quot;orbit&quot; and moves closer to the Centre and yet not merging into it=\r\n, \ndeeper and deeper.=C2=A0 \n\n\nThere is a book of conversations between Tot=\r\napuri and a certain sadhaka (his \ndisciple) when Totapuri lived in Puri. He=\r\n used to stay in the Swargadwara \nsmashana and later someone build a small =\r\nashram for him. Totapuri&#39;s ashram still \nexists in Puri. In that conversati=\r\non, Totapuri also mentions a similar ideas of \nwhat is a siddha and higher.=\r\n And how only a Siddha and none less=C2=A0is a true \nVigyani. He further me=\r\nntions that Swami Vivekananda did not (need) to=C2=A0go to the \nstage of a =\r\nSiddha. His work was specific, he did the work and went off. He did \nnot ne=\r\ned to and therefore did not=C2=A0become a Siddha. I see zero confusion here=\r\n.\n\r\n--0-1648588190-1312224146=:29705\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;=\r\nfont-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Narasimha,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;You assumed that Paramahamsa, S=\r\niddha, Natha (Mahasiddha) and Rishi are fixed categories and exponentially =\r\n&quot;greater&quot; than each other.&gt;&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DVe=\r\nrdana&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2 face=3DVerdana&gt;I assume because V=\r\nimalananda mentions that they are greater to each other.

Since the topic of siddhis did come up, Vimalanand=\r\na&#39;s ability to suck up a ton of mercury by Vajroli and bring it out from hi=\r\ns hair infront of someone of Vishudhananda&#39;s spiritual calibre, is not a ea=\r\nsy feat.

That is a crucial difference.&nbsp; M=\r\ny comparisons are always based NOT on my understanding, but clear words of =\r\ngreat spiritual people. That is why I am 100 perecent clear that Ramakrishn=\r\na is spiritually higher than a Vivekananada or an Abhedananda. You may not =\r\nwant to judge them., thats your point of view. I on the other hand would ra=\r\nther rely on the clear words of Vivekananda and Abhedananda on this matter =\r\nrather than speculation. Both Vivekananda and Abhedananda used to say Ramak=\r\nrishna is their Guru and spiritually far higher than they were. &lt;FONT size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D3 =\r\nface=3DVerdana&gt;&nbsp; &lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D3 face=3DVerdana&gt;4) Whether Ramakrishna was a=\r\n paramhamsa or a siddha in Vimalananda&#39;s scale is merely your speculation. =\r\nVimalananda&#39;s books however betray no such speculation. I would rather rely=\r\n on the words of the book. &lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=\r\n=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D3 face=3DVerdana&gt;&nbsp; &lt;FONT size=3D2=\r\n&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D3 face=\r\n=3DVerdana&gt;5) In this age everyone likes to take a title for himself. Many =\r\nspiritual people name themselves Rishis, and we know it they are not.&nbsp;=\r\n So the Nityananda comparison does not stand. Vimalananda on his part never=\r\n used any titles, not even the term Guru. I base my judgement of this man o=\r\nn a) critical study of the books b) Manish&#39;s words. And I have not found yo=\r\nu giving any sound logic for why I should change the same. &lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&lt;=\r\n/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#000000 size=3D3 face=\r\n=3DVerdana&gt;&nbsp; &lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Dleft&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT color=3D#000000 size=3D3 face=3DVerdana&gt;6) If you do not want to compare=\r\n spiritual people, that is perfectly fine.

Climbing hill is one&#39;s spirit=\r\nual sadhana. Reaching the top is liberation. Different people climb the hil=\r\nl from different sides and using different paths.
