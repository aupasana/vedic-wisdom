Giving samadhi to a highly logical person (logi=\r\ncal mind is a great obstacle) like Naren just by a mere touch is no ordinar=\r\ny feat. He not only experienced sahaja samadhi himself, which is off limits=\r\n for even great siddhas, but induced it in Naren for a few days by the powe=\r\nr of his thought. All these are signs of a being of the highest class.\n \nKn=\r\nowing what kind a being Ramakrishna is, I am not too surprised or excited b=\r\ny what you said. I am really and genuinely sorry that you expected a differ=\r\nent reaction from me. But I don&#39;t feign a reaction that I do not really fee=\r\nl. I am really sorry.\n \nWhat you described IS a miracle. I do not doubt it =\r\nat all. I am sorry if I gave that impression.\n \n*        *        *\n \nHones=\r\ntly, when I read several of the miraculous deeds of Ramakrishna, I do not f=\r\neel much excitement or emotion. I don&#39;t know why. On the other hand, simple=\r\n episodes like how he cried and begged Vivekananda not to leave make me wee=\r\np. He transformed Naren from an overly logical young boy to a mature man wi=\r\nth the highest vairagya and he gave Naren many tremendous spiritual experie=\r\nnces. Later Vivekananda said that the &quot;mad brahmin&quot; transformed him and mad=\r\ne him who he was. He said Ramakrishna could have created 100 Vivekanandas f=\r\nrom dirt! Yet, Ramakrishna did not feel any entitlement or ownership and, i=\r\nnstead, he cried and begged his disciple to not leave and do the Mother&#39;s w=\r\nork. What a pure and sattwik soul! When I think of his attitude, I get goos=\r\nebumps.\n \nWhen I read how he simply left the premises when told by a repres=\r\nentative of Mathur that he was dismissed and had to leave the temple and ho=\r\nw he came back as if nothing happned when Mathur came and fell at his feet =\r\nand how he behaved the same way as if nothing happened in both cases is a p=\r\nractical demonstration of what Krishna taught in Gita. When I read about th=\r\nat, I melt in emotion.\n \nThus, simple episodes bringing out the attitude of=\r\n Thakur and illustrate how a sthita prajna described by Krishna in Gita beh=\r\naves excite me.\n \nThe things about Ramakrishna that excite me, make me weep=\r\n and make me emotional may be a little different from some other people.\n \n=\r\nBottomline is that Thakur exictes both of us. Perhaps there are different a=\r\nspects of Thakur that we are attached to and attracted to. But the good thi=\r\nng is that we are both attracted to him.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSuppose wh=\r\nat he said to Sarada Mata was only a &quot;desire&quot; and it did not happen. Suppos=\r\ne he is reborn after 150 years and has not yet come back. My point is that =\r\neven then some people may have experiences of seeing his old embodied form,=\r\n even as he exists on earth in a different body.\n \n*        *        *\n \nAg=\r\nain, I am sincerely sorry for disappointing a sincere and blessed devotee o=\r\nf Thakur. :-(\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree =\r\nJyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish soft=\r\nware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ashwi=\r\nn Rawal \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Friday, November 07, 2=\r\n008 12:09 PM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still al=\r\nive today\n\n        Dear Narsimhaji,\n        I have joined this group for la=\r\nst one year. I have read your valuable articles on this site. I also knew t=\r\nhat you are the lover and follower of Shri Shri Thakur. This was the reason=\r\n I wrote this mail on Thakur. I have narrated this incident to very few peo=\r\nple who are loving Thakur and when I told this incident they all were weepi=\r\nng. But I am sorry that your mail disappointed me. You have given analysis =\r\nof this incident on intellectual level or it was more logical and less devo=\r\ntional. I was expecting the excitement in your mail but you just justified =\r\nthat it is possible as our faith is working...!!!\n        Dear Sir, for you=\r\nr information I would write that when this incident happened I was not know=\r\ning Thakur, nor was any devotion towards Him. It was due to Mr. Patel I had=\r\n just taken the decision to accept HIM as my Guru. I was also upset in the =\r\nmorning after discussion with my wife and started thinking that my decision=\r\n was hasty. I just taken a chance as I was told by Mr. Patel that you can t=\r\nest Thakur before you accept him as your Guru. I remembered his words that =\r\nmorning and told my wife that if my decision is right, Mr. Patel should com=\r\ne to my house. I was not knowing then actually Mr. Patel will come to my pl=\r\nace within 10 minutes and Thakur will show him the way to my home. \n       =\r\n You have written that Thakur might have taken rebirth after 100 years. I t=\r\nhink this was his desire and not necessary he is already born now.It is His=\r\n will to take 100 years or 150 years for re-birth. I am now strongly believ=\r\ne that Thakur is still alive on earth because my another incidents are also=\r\n leading me to believe that He is coming to this earth. Mr. Patel was exper=\r\niencing him very offen. \n        It was a miracle and whenever I remember t=\r\nhis day I am excited. I am not his staunch devotee even today but still He =\r\nis with me, He loves me rather. Oh, what to say !\n\n        Dr.Ashwin Rawal\n=\r\n\n        --- On Thu, 6/11/08, Narasimha P.V.R.

Thank you =\r\nfor sharing it.\n\n          After Ramakrishna left his body, several people =\r\nsaw him in embodied form.\n\n          That is entirely possible. When someon=\r\ne who did not identify with a body but identified with the entire universe =\r\nlives in a body and leaves, it is not like he has left. He is still there, =\r\nin every atom and in everything. If someone is attached to him with that bo=\r\ndy of his and he has compassion for that person, he *can* give darshan to t=\r\nhat person in that body. It is not that he is &quot;alive&quot; or &quot;dead&quot;. It is just=\r\n that he is in every atom or sub-atomic particle of this creation because h=\r\ne has realized the true nature of Self while living in the previous body an=\r\nd that realization was intact even while leaving that body.\n\n          Acco=\r\nrding to Sarada Mata, Ramakrishna told her and Lakshmi that he would be bac=\r\nk after 100 years and that all of them would have to be reborn when he is r=\r\neborn after 100 years. Thus, he may have already come to earth in a differe=\r\nnt body. But that does not matter. Those who have an attachment to Ramakris=\r\nhna and stuck at the lower level form may still be able to access his previ=\r\nous form.\n\n          Even after the form of Rama left this world and the fo=\r\nrm of Krishna was born, a devotee of Rama who does great tapascharya for Ra=\r\nma may be able to realize a darshan of the form of Rama.\n\n          Ramakri=\r\nshna Paramahamsa was almost certainly an avatara.\n\n          Best regards,\n=\r\n          Narasimha\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- ---------\n          Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n          Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n          Spirituality: http://groups. yah=\r\noo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n          Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ve=\r\ndicastro. home.comcast. net\n          Free Jyotish software (Windows): http=\r\n://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n          Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: h=\r\nttp://www.SriJagan nath.org\n          ------------ --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- \n\n            ----- Original Message --=\r\n--- \n            From: Ashwin Rawal \n            To: Vedic-wisdom@ yahoogro=\r\nups. com \n            Cc: pvr@charter. net \n            Sent: Wednesday, No=\r\nvember 05, 2008 10:25 AM\n            Subject: Shri Shri THAKUR is still ali=\r\nve today\n\n                  Dear Sir, I would like to share one of my great=\r\n Devine experience about shri Ramkrishnadev. This is an unbelievable experi=\r\nence that I have had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing e=\r\nxactly as was happened in my life. I am going back to the period of 1973/74=\r\n. Kindly read this only when you are in religious mood. \n\n                 =\r\n  \n\n                  I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post offic=\r\ne near Dwarka. My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee all=\r\nowance for extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post=\r\n office and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some Telephone=\r\n operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel) was wo=\r\nrking as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of    shri Ramkrishnadev. Whene=\r\nver I was meeting him he was always talking about shri Thakur. We came clos=\r\ne day by day. There was a weekly gathering at his home called SATSANGA. He =\r\nwas singing devotional songs created by him and was weeping while singing. =\r\nHe was reading Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending=\r\n this weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Pate=\r\nl was of 30 then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty h=\r\nours and were talking only about Thakur. \n\n                  One day when w=\r\ne were at sea shore he suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some guest hav=\r\ne come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My son will come in a few =\r\nminutes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with my surpris=\r\ne his 8 years old son came to call him. \n\n                  At one another =\r\nincident he told me that there will be a plane crash tomorrow and that also=\r\n happened. I was very much impressed about him. He could foresee the events=\r\n. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he told me not to go through bus, a=\r\ns bus tire will be punctured. Yet I went to Bus station but bus did not com=\r\ne from Dwarka as was punctured on the way. This was surprising. \n\n         =\r\n         This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super power=\r\n and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to shri Th=\r\nakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri Thakur and the d=\r\nay came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself to Thakur at Mr. Pat=\r\nel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed him deeply from my heart=\r\n to accept me as his follower and bestow his grace. \n\n                  Nex=\r\nt day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning while taking =\r\nthe tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was waking up at 5.45 morning.=\r\n I told to my wife in the morning that I have accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev a=\r\ns my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and she argued with me a lot. =E2=80=94=\r\n=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision? Ramkrishna Paramhamsa w=\r\nas a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a great Saint but our Guru sho=\r\nuld be living one, who can guide us, give us Mantra etc. etc. Better you ta=\r\nke Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=\r\n=80=9D--. \n\n                  Her arguments were right at her place as peop=\r\nle in general not know much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- ye=\r\ns I have taken hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. -- \n\n  =\r\n                But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was t=\r\nelling their disciples to test him before accepting him. I also decided to =\r\ntest Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =E2=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Pat=\r\nel has never come to our home. You have also not seen him. He has never ask=\r\ned me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house within 10=\r\n to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection for Thakur is perfect?=\r\n=E2=80=9D-- \n\n                  She laughed at me=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CHow it i=\r\ns possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=9D-- \n\n                  I praye=\r\nd Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my decision and conv=\r\nince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence even today.=E2=80=99 \n=\r\n\n                  To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30=\r\n in the morning with angry mood. What he told? \n\n                  =E2=80=\r\n=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happened? Yesterday=\r\n was my night duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30 mornings today a=\r\nnd tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur pulled my blanket and t=\r\nold me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s house. He is waiting for =\r\nyou. He wants to test me. I will show you his house=E2=80=9D \n\n            =\r\n      I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the way to y=\r\nour house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are disturbing him in =\r\nsuch an early morning for such a silly things?=E2=80=99 \n\n                 =\r\n We both were so excited and surprised that we had no words that Morning. \n=\r\n\n                  I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my =\r\nlife. There were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will =\r\nwrite it sometime. \n\n                  Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkris=\r\nhandev is still alive on the earth. This is a fact I have written and no wo=\r\nrd is added to exaggerate.  May Shri Thakur bless all of us. \n\n            =\r\n      Dr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad \n                 \n       \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_01BE_01C94118.C9EA5D10\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;utf-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n=EF=BB=BF&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HT=\r\nML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Du=\r\ntf-8&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;#ygrp-mkp {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid;=\r\n PADDING-RIGHT: 14px; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 14px; PA=\r\nDDING-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 14px 0px; BORDER-LEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDIN=\r\nG-TOP: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\n}\n#ygrp-mk=\r\np HR {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BOR=\r\nDER-LEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #=\r\nhd {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 85%; MARGIN: 10px 0px; COLOR: #628c2a; =\r\nLINE-HEIGHT: 122%\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n\tMARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {=\r\n\n\tPADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: =\r\n0px\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad A {\n\tCOLOR: #0000ff; TEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3429&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgCo=\r\nlor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste Ashwin ji,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Well, I am truly sorry that I disappointed \nyou.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Thakur isn&#39;t an ordinary being.

I don&#39;t know \nwhy. On the other hand, simple episodes like how he =\r\ncried and begged Vivekananda \nnot to leave make me weep. He transformed Nar=\r\nen from an overly logical young boy \nto a mature man with the highest vaira=\r\ngya and he gave Naren many tremendous \nspiritual experiences. Later Vivekan=\r\nanda said that the &quot;mad brahmin&quot; transformed \nhim and made him who he was. =\r\nHe said Ramakrishna could have&nbsp;created 100 \nVivekanandas from dirt!&nb=\r\nsp;Yet, Ramakrishna did not feel any entitlement or \nownership and, instead=\r\n, he cried and begged his disciple to&nbsp;not \nleave&nbsp;and do the Mothe=\r\nr&#39;s work. What a pure and sattwik soul! When I think \nof his attitude, I ge=\r\nt goosebumps.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;When I read how he simply left the pr=\r\nemises when \ntold by a representative of Mathur that he was dismissed and h=\r\nad to leave the \ntemple and how he came back as if nothing happned when Mat=\r\nhur came and fell at \nhis feet and how he behaved the same way as if nothin=\r\ng happened in both cases is \na practical demonstration of what Krishna taug=\r\nht in Gita.

It was due to Mr. Patel I had just taken the \n        decision =\r\nto accept HIM as my Guru. I was also upset in the morning after \n        di=\r\nscussion with my wife and started thinking that my decision was hasty. \n   =\r\n     I just taken a chance as I was told by Mr. Patel that you can test \n  =\r\n      Thakur before you accept him as your Guru. I remembered his words tha=\r\nt \n        morning and told my wife that if my decision is right, Mr. Patel=\r\n should \n        come to my house. I was not knowing then actually Mr. Pate=\r\nl will come to \n        my place within 10 minutes and Thakur will show him=\r\n the way to my home. \n        &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n        &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DVerda=\r\nna&gt;You have written that Thakur might have taken \n        rebirth after 100=\r\n years.

I am now strongly believe that Thakur is still alive \n        on =\r\nearth because my another incidents are also leading me to believe \n        =\r\nthat He is coming to this earth.

My =\r\nduty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting \n                  late fee al=\r\nlowance for extra duty.

One Mr. \n               =\r\n   Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel) was working \n          =\r\n        as Operator. He was a staunch devotee \n                  of&lt;SPAN&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;/SPAN&gt;shri Ramkrishnadev. Whenever \n                  I w=\r\nas meeting him he was always talking about shri Thakur. We \n               =\r\n   came close day by day. There was a weekly gathering at his \n            =\r\n      home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created \n      =\r\n            by him and was weeping while singing. He was reading \n         =\r\n         Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending \n    =\r\n              this weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years =\r\n\n                  old. Mr. Patel was of 30 then. We were used to go to sea=\r\nshore \n                  daily at 7 pm after duty hours and were talking on=\r\nly about \n                  Thakur.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n                  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n                  &lt;P class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: Ve=\r\nrdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT \n                  size=3D3&gt;One day when we were at sea shore =\r\nhe suddenly told \n                  me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some guest have=\r\n come to my home and my wife is \n                  remembering me.

I wa=\r\ns very much \n                  impressed about him. He could foresee the ev=\r\nents. One day I \n                  had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he told me n=\r\not to go through bus, \n                  as bus tire will be punctured. Yet=\r\n I went to Bus station but \n                  bus did not come from Dwarka =\r\nas was punctured on the way.

I \n              =\r\n    was attracted to shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also \n       =\r\n           be disciple of shri Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. \n =\r\n                 At 7 pm I surrendered myself to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=\r\n=99s house \n                  before Thakur picture.

As my duty was to start \n       =\r\n           from 7 am I was waking up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife \n  =\r\n                in the morning that I have accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as m=\r\ny \n                  Gurudev.

Ramkrishna \n                  Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kal=\r\ni at Calcutta.
