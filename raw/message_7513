Specifically, are there any days that should be avoided?\n\nRecently=\r\n I came across this information:\n\n-Quote:\n\n&quot;It is advisable to do Homam(Hav=\r\nan) when the fire is on earth and in the Homahuti when Guru, Shukra or Budh=\r\na receives aahuti. \n\nMany astrologers requested to include homahuti into pa=\r\nnchangam. This is based on the distance between the sun&#39;s nakshatra and the=\r\n moon&#39;s nakshatra. It is auspicious to do shanti karma/ shraut karma when t=\r\nhe fire location is on earth and the ahuti goes to Budha -- showers intelli=\r\ngence., =A0Venus --&gt; all material wishes fulfilled, worldly wealth property=\r\n. Jupiter -&gt; fulfillment of desires. moon-&gt;crops will be inundated, Sun-&gt;de=\r\nstruction of auspicious effects, Mars-&gt;fear of fire, Saturn-&gt;destruction of=\r\n wealth, Rahu/ketu-&gt; loss of every kind, famine, health troubles. \n\nHowever=\r\n, please remember for performing devi yaaga different chakra is used. &quot;\n\n-U=\r\nnquote\n\n***\n\nAll these are beyond the comprehension of someone illiterate i=\r\nn astrology and the effects of planets. What strikes as a &quot;warning&quot; though =\r\nis the statement that during certain planetary positions there could be adv=\r\nerse results if performing homam.\n\nIf one is performing a Ganapati or Chand=\r\ni homam (at a beginner level) with the sankalpa of simply attaining spiritu=\r\nal development and liberation in mind, would this &quot;warning&quot; be of any relev=\r\nance?\n\nThank you.\n\nWarmest regards..\n\n\n\n"}}
