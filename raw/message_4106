However, the British tried to suppress all efforts for\nfreedom and kept=\r\n the Indian people down by force and inflicted severe\npunishment. The India=\r\nns were afraid of the British rulers, who had a\ngreat army equipped with mo=\r\ndern weapons, while they were armed only with\ntheir courage and bravery. Ma=\r\nny of them believed that to rebel against\nthe powerful British Empire would=\r\n be futile. Mahaprabhuji encouraged\nthem to strive for freedom through pati=\r\nence and perseverance and not\nwith force.\n\nMahaprabhuji foretold that an en=\r\nd would soon come to British rule and\ndue to his inspiration, hundreds of I=\r\nndians regained courage through\nbelief in his protection.\n\nOnce when Mahapr=\r\nabhuji and some disciples were in Mount Abu they decided\nto go to Sabarmati=\r\n, the ashram of Mahatma Gandhi. Gandhi came to the\ndoor of the ashram to we=\r\nlcome Mahaprabhuji and indeed it was a great\nmoment when these two outstand=\r\ning personalities met.\n\nMahatma Gandhi requested Mahaprabhuji sing one of h=\r\nis bhajans.\n\n&quot;Master, please grant us the opportunity to hear your famous s=\r\nongs,\nwhich we are told deeply move the hearts of all and fill them with\nDi=\r\nvine Light. Your existence in this world truly leads everyone to the\npath o=\r\nf liberation!&quot;\n\n&quot;And it is your existence which serves to liberate the Indi=\r\nan people,&quot;\nMahaprabhuji said in reply. &quot;No-one can stop you in this. Your =\r\nservice\nto India will make history and the story of your life will always b=\r\ne an\ninspiration to others.&quot;\n\nMahaprabhuji then sang a bhajan and finally s=\r\npoke to those present.\n\n&quot;My dear people! India is the country of ahimsa[1],=\r\n none will ever\nsuffer due to us. The Vedas expound ahimsa as the highest p=\r\nrinciple in\nhuman dharma. Do not give up this principle! Truth cannot be de=\r\nstroyed\nor changed, it is pure. Truth will always reign victorious[2]. Live=\r\n\nsimply with an honest heart and high thoughts. Honour your trade and\nrespe=\r\nct the traditions. Mahatma Gandhi is a brilliant example for you in\nthis!\n\n=\r\n&quot;In a former life he was King Ajayapal, who himself tended the goats of\nthe=\r\n kingdom and he reigned successfully with wisdom and simplicity. Not\nonly d=\r\nid the people worship him, but the animals as well. During his\nrule the mig=\r\nhty demon Ravana ruled in Sri Lanka and he demanded tributes\nfrom all India=\r\nn kings. But even the mighty Ravana was afraid of King\nAjayapal.\n\n&quot;One day =\r\nRavana said to his queen, Mandodari: &#39;Today I shall put the\npowers of Ajaya=\r\npal to a test&#39;. The queen at that moment was feeding her\ndoves and on a sud=\r\nden impulse she spoke to them, &#39;Doves! If you are\nloyal to King Ajayapal, d=\r\non&#39;t eat these grains&#39;. The doves hid their\nheads under their wings and kep=\r\nt away from the feed.\n\n&quot;However, one dove didn&#39;t hear the queen&#39;s words and=\r\n ate the grain.\nImmediately it died. The queen turned to Ravana and said, &#39;=\r\nThis is an\nill omen. You now know the might of King Ajayapal&#39;.\n\n&quot;But Ravana=\r\n didn&#39;t care for such signs and instead sent his emissaries\nto the king dem=\r\nanding tribute. On reaching the court, the emissaries\nlearned that the king=\r\n was away tending the goats, so they waited for him\nto return. In the eveni=\r\nng, the king heard of the arrival of the\nemissaries and put on his best rob=\r\nes and welcomed the visitors in the\nthrone room of his palace. The emissari=\r\nes delivered the message from\nRavana.\n\n&quot;King Ajayapal then ordered the emis=\r\nsaries to go into the courtyard and\nmake a drawing in the sand of Ravana&#39;s =\r\npalace. When they had finished,\nKing Ajayapal took a stick and smudged a pa=\r\nrt of the drawing. He then\nturned to the visitors with a smile and said, &#39;R=\r\neturn to Ravana&#39;s palace\nand if you find levelled to the ground this part o=\r\nf the royal walls that\nI have here erased with my stick, then tell your kin=\r\ng that I would well\nadvise him to demand no tribute ever more&#39;!\n\n&quot;He contin=\r\nued, &#39;In just this way I could destroy all Sri Lanka without\nstepping out o=\r\nf my palace. Now go to your king and report this to him&#39;.\n\n&quot;The emissaries =\r\nreturned to Ravana and found exactly that part of the\npalace which King Aja=\r\nyapal had smudged in the sand indeed had fallen to\nthe ground. This inciden=\r\nt so thoroughly frightened Ravana that never\nagain did he quarrel with King=\r\n Ajayapal.\n\n&quot;Mahatma Gandhi is the reincarnation of this great king. In thi=\r\ns life\nalso he carries the shepherd&#39;s crook in his hand. Wherever he goes,\n=\r\npeople are subject to his crook. The power of his devotion to India will\nen=\r\nsure victory over the British.&quot;\n\nThe listeners were deeply moved by Gurudev=\r\na&#39;s words, for they knew that\nhe always spoke the truth. After this meaning=\r\nful meeting with Gandhi,\nMahaprabhuji returned to Mount Abu.\n\nOn the day of=\r\n Gurupurnima, thousands of devotees came to Mahaprabhuji&#39;s\nsatsang.\n\n&quot;Lord,=\r\n you promised us swarajaya =97 self-determination,&quot; one of them\nsaid. &quot;Plea=\r\nse tell us how long India will remain free and how things\nwill be for our c=\r\nountry in the future. When will a new satya yuga begin,\nwhen Saints and wis=\r\ne men will again rule over the land? And when will\nyou, God&#39;s incarnation, =\r\nreturn to build the kingdom of sat sanatan\ndharma?&quot;\n\n&quot;These questions touch=\r\n the core of the universe, so listen well,&quot;\nMahaprabhuji answered with a sm=\r\nile.\n\n&quot;The independence of India will last for a very long time and thereaf=\r\nter\nmany forms of government will follow. Finally, at the beginning of saty=\r\na\nyuga, the age of truth, the great rishis and wise men will incarnate\nfrom=\r\n the highest level and build the kingdom of wisdom on earth.&quot;\n\nIn a bhajan,=\r\n Mahaprabhuji continued:\n\n\n\nHO RAJ MAHARISHAYA KO HO VELA RE\n\nMay it be soo=\r\nn that wise men rule the states!\n\nThe Mahatma has appeared to extinguish th=\r\ne castes,\n\nHe will clean India&#39;s system,\n\nDifference in race and status wil=\r\nl be abolished,\n\nNow the era of arrogance ends.\n\nSatguru Sri Devpuriji proc=\r\nlaimed this truth\n\nAnd Swami Deep is his ambassador,\n\nUnder the gracious pr=\r\notection of the Guru\n\nHe realizes the unfathomable Lila, the Divine Play.\n\n=\r\n\n\nAfter this bhajan, Mahaprabhuji prophesied that at the end of the rule\nof=\r\n Saints, he himself would again incarnate on earth, in conformity with\nthe =\r\nwords of The Bhagavad Gita that says: God always comes to earth to\nre-estab=\r\nlish the empire of Truth, when true faith is in danger.\n\n&quot;When I descend to=\r\n earth from the Divine level of satya loka, satya yuga\nwill again blossom w=\r\nith me.
