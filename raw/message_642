Even great jnaanis are \noccasionally deluded by Her power. One ca=\r\nn understand unmanifested non-dual \nBrahman, but one cannot hope to underst=\r\nand the dual world fully ever. She is \ncapable of deluding even the greates=\r\nt sadhaka with a wrong idea as soon as \none ventures into duality. She can =\r\nmislead *anyone* on *anything*. What She \ndoes and why She does that is so =\r\ndifficult to fathom. The only way to deal \nwith Her is to surrender to Her =\r\npower *fully*.\n\n&gt; on the other hand we are all a part of Divinity\n\nBTW, tho=\r\nugh we are all part of the same Divinity, we are all not the same. \nIn the =\r\nnon-dual field, we are all the same. But, in the field of duality, we \nhave=\r\n differences due to previous vasanas (conditioning) , which decide what \nan=\r\nd how much we can do within the dual world. When a being like Krishna is \nb=\r\norn with 16 kalas, He can do *anything* with the objects of the dual world.=\r\n \nWhen a being like Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of =\r\n\nthings in the dual world that are impossible for others.\n\nRealizing the no=\r\nn-dual Self is something that is possible for anyone, but \nthere are limits=\r\n imposed on what things one can do in the dual world, based \non the force o=\r\nf previous conditioning. Thus, all are the same at one \n(non-dual) level an=\r\nd all are different at another (dual) level.\n\nBut it is tough to know for s=\r\nure what one&#39;s caliber is. Thus, your basic \npoint holds. But I just wanted=\r\n to point that all are not indeed the same. We \nshould be disinterested in =\r\nknowing who is what, not because all are the \nsame, but because we have no =\r\nsurefire way to know who is what.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ g=\r\nroup/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comc=\r\nast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nS=\r\nri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n-----------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n----- Original Mess=\r\nage ----- \nFrom: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@nambisan. net&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom=\r\n@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\nSent: Monday, November 10, 2008 7:54 PM\nSubject: [vedic=\r\n-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today\n\n|| Om Lokaah Samastaah =\r\nSukhino Bhavantuh ||\n\nDoes it matter at all who is whose reincarnation?

Sri Yogeshwar was=\r\n a very highly\n&gt; realized saint. His book is very good. He does mention abo=\r\nut his\n&gt; prevoius birth and also mentions that Saccha Baba had also confirm=\r\ned\n&gt; the same thing. Saccha Baba was another very highly realized saint too=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Yogeshwar had many times visions of Sai Baba of shirdi and Naamde=\r\nv\n&gt; and also many other saints too. The initiation he got on the bank of\n&gt; =\r\nriver Narmada awakened his kundalini and he has described very\n&gt; accurately=\r\n the state and symptoms after awekaning of kunalini. He had\n&gt; very good com=\r\nmand on all aspects of sprituality and was a fantastic\n&gt; orator. His follow=\r\ners have done a very good job of putting up the web\n&gt; site and sharing the =\r\ninformation for free both audio and books.\n&gt;\n&gt; Chiti Leela or the play of S=\r\nhakti or God is very complex, Ramakrishna\n&gt; may have taken birth as more th=\r\nan one person and in future may take\n&gt; more births.\n&gt;\n&gt; His comsic body (ka=\r\nran sharir) or whatever name others use pardon my\n&gt; lack of appropriate wor=\r\nd, is also alive and manifest from time to time\n&gt; After reading this and ot=\r\nher books, I feel that each one of us has a\n&gt; inner guru along with our atm=\r\na and this inner guru in conjunction with\n&gt; our accumulated or sanchit sank=\r\naras give us visions of these mahatmas\n&gt; or help us attach or attract to a =\r\nSaint or some aspects of the saint\n&gt; more than others. This inner guru is t=\r\nhe same in all humam beings but\n&gt; manifests uniquely based on each person.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; I also believe that one needs to get initiated by a Guru who is\n&gt; prese=\r\nnt in physical form and seek guidance from him time to time.\n&gt; There are ma=\r\nny instances of other forms of inititations like\n&gt; initiation in dream or i=\r\nnititation by cosmic forms, these forms of\n&gt; initiations though very import=\r\nant are very rare or uncommon.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; After reading Sri Yogeshwar&#39;s book I h=\r\nad some questions pop up in my\n&gt; mind about him.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1) What was the purpos=\r\ne of his birth? Yes he may have guided many\n&gt; spiritual aspirants, but ther=\r\ne has to be something more unique.\n&gt; 2) Did he realize the ultimate? i.e. h=\r\ne keeps mentioning in the book\n&gt; about it in many places? Was he satisfied?=\r\n How did he feel after that?\n&gt; 3) He did pass away abruptly in bombay while=\r\n in the middle of giving\n&gt; spirtual talks? It seems unusual.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have als=\r\no read somewhere that once a person reaches a spiritual\n&gt; state, he cannot =\r\nremain in human body for more than few days, was this\n&gt; the case?\n&gt;\n&gt; May b=\r\ne others who have read this book can share more light.\n&gt; I do recommend to =\r\nseekers of spirutuality to read this book if one has\n&gt; time, it is availabl=\r\ne for free to download as a pdf book on his web\nsite.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Ram Sharma al=\r\nso has done a lot of work for the betterment and\n&gt; upliftment, a lot of his=\r\n information is wellknown.

I am going back to the period of\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; 1973/74.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly read this only when you are in religious mood.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office=\r\n near\n&gt; &gt; Dwarka.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting lat=\r\ne fee allowance\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange ju=\r\nst opposite to Post\n&gt; &gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep=C3=A2?Tt; I had friend=\r\nship with some\n&gt; &gt; Telephone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we =\r\nwill call him as Mr. Patel)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch=\r\n devotee of=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was me=\r\neting him he was always talking\n&gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close =\r\nday by day. There was a weekly\n&gt; &gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSA=\r\nNGA. He was singing devotional songs created\n&gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weepi=\r\nng while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 y=\r\noungsters were attending this weekly\n&gt; &gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening.=\r\n I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used to g=\r\no to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only ab=\r\nout Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=A2?oRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife i=\r\ns remembering me. My\n&gt; &gt; son\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call me. I=\r\n shall have to go now=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD. -\n&gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise h=\r\nis 8 years old son came to call him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he tol=\r\nd me that there will be a plane\n&gt; &gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happ=\r\nened. I was very much impressed about\n&gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the e=\r\nvents. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus,\n&gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go=\r\n through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus statio=\r\nn but bus did not come from Dwarka as was\n&gt; &gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. T=\r\nhis was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he h=\r\nad some super\n&gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship onl=\r\ny. I was attracted to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also b=\r\ne disciple of shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm =\r\nI surrendered\n&gt; &gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=C3=A2?Ts house before=\r\n Thakur picture. I prayed\n&gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me a=\r\ns his follower and bestow his\n&gt; &gt; grace.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a d=\r\niscussion with my wife at 6.10 morning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea.

Even great jnaanis are &lt;BR&gt;occasionally deluded by Her=\r\n power. One can understand unmanifested non-dual &lt;BR&gt;Brahman, but one canno=\r\nt hope to understand the dual world fully ever. She is &lt;BR&gt;capable of delud=\r\ning even the greatest sadhaka with a wrong idea as soon as &lt;BR&gt;one ventures=\r\n into duality. She can mislead *anyone* on *anything*. What She &lt;BR&gt;does an=\r\nd why She does that is so difficult to fathom. The only way to deal &lt;BR&gt;wit=\r\nh Her is to surrender to Her power *fully*.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; on the other hand w=\r\ne are all a part of Divinity&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;BTW, though we are all part of the same=\r\n Divinity, we are all not the same. &lt;BR&gt;In the non-dual field, we are all t=\r\nhe same. But, in the field of duality, we &lt;BR&gt;have differences due to previ=\r\nous vasanas\n (conditioning) , which decide what &lt;BR&gt;and how much we can do =\r\nwithin the dual world. When a being like Krishna is &lt;BR&gt;born with 16 kalas,=\r\n He can do *anything* with the objects of the dual world. &lt;BR&gt;When a being =\r\nlike Sai Baba is born with 2 or 3 kalas, He can do a lot of &lt;BR&gt;things in t=\r\nhe dual world that are impossible for others.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Realizing the non-dual=\r\n Self is something that is possible for anyone, but &lt;BR&gt;there are limits im=\r\nposed on what things one can do in the dual world, based &lt;BR&gt;on the force o=\r\nf previous conditioning. Thus, all are the same at one &lt;BR&gt;(non-dual) level=\r\n and all are different at another (dual) level.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;But it is tough to k=\r\nnow for sure what one&#39;s caliber is. Thus, your basic &lt;BR&gt;point holds. But I=\r\n just wanted to point that all are not indeed the same. We &lt;BR&gt;should be di=\r\nsinterested in knowing who is what, not because all are the &lt;BR&gt;same, but b=\r\necause we have no surefire way to know who is what.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best\n regards,&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.or=\r\ng/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ ho=\r\nmam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologe=\r\nr.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.o=\r\nrg/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/v=\r\nedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group=\r\n/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicas=\r\ntro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. ho=\r\nme.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://w=\r\nww.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst=\r\n rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://w=\r\nww.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan\n n=\r\nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;&lt;=\r\nA href=3D&quot;mailto:dinesh%40nambisan.net&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;dine=\r\nsh@nambisan. net&lt;/A&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To: &lt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoog=\r\nroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sent: Monday, November 10, 2008 7:54 PM&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;|| Om Lokaah Samastaah Su=\r\nkhino Bhavantuh ||&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Does it matter at all who is whose reincarnation?=\r\n And anyway, how will&lt;BR&gt;you distinguish when *those* very folks have gone =\r\nbeyond the meaning&lt;BR&gt;of &quot;I&quot;?

Yes he may have guided many&lt;BR&gt;&gt; spiritual aspirant=\r\ns, but there has to be something more unique.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) Did he realize the=\r\n ultimate? i.e. he keeps mentioning in the book&lt;BR&gt;&gt; about it in many pl=\r\naces? Was he satisfied? How did he feel after\n that?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 3) He did pass=\r\n away abruptly in bombay while in the middle of giving&lt;BR&gt;&gt; spirtual tal=\r\nks? It seems unusual.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have also read somewhere that once =\r\na person reaches a spiritual&lt;BR&gt;&gt; state, he cannot remain in human body =\r\nfor more than few days, was this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the case?&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; May be o=\r\nthers who have read this book can share more light.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I do recommend =\r\nto seekers of spirutuality to read this book if one has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; time, it is=\r\n available for free to download as a pdf book on his web&lt;BR&gt;site.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Sri Ram Sharma also has done a lot of work for the betterment and&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; upliftment, a lot of his information is wellknown.

One Mr. =\r\nRamanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; was work=\r\ning as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 shri&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talkin=\r\ng&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by da=\r\ny. There was a weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; gathering\n at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; his home=\r\n called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; by&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrish=\r\nna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this=\r\n weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; meeting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was t=\r\nhen 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; then. We were used =\r\nto go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and were=\r\n talking only about Thakur.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at =\r\nsea shore he suddenly told me--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=A2?oRawalbhai,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; son&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call me. I s=\r\nhall have to go now=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD. -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; And=\r\n with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; At one another incident he told me that there\n will be a plane&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; crash&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very mu=\r\nch impressed about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the=\r\n events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as wa=\r\ns&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; punctured&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had s=\r\nome super&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; power&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrish=\r\nandev worship only. I was attracted to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One d=\r\nay I thought, I should also be disciple of shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur an=\r\nd the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; myself&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=C3=A2?Ts house before Thakur pictu=\r\nre. I prayed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; him&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n deeply from my heart to ac=\r\ncept me as his follower and bestow his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; grace.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I wa=\r\ns&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; waking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wi=\r\nfe in the morning that I have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev=\r\n as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; she&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nargued with me a lot. =C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oWhy should you take such a hasty&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; decision?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of=\r\n Maa Kali at Calcutta.

I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before accepting him. I also de=\r\ncided to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =C3=\r\n=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oSee, Mr. Patel&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; never come t=\r\no our home. You have also not seen him. He has never&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; asked&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our hou=\r\nse&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; within&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believ=\r\ne that my selection for Thakur is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; perfect?=C3=A2?=EF=BF=\r\n=BD--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=C3=A2?&quot;=C3=A2?oHow it is pos=\r\nsible? I don=C3=A2?Tt believe.=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; I\n prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify m=\r\ny&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; decision and convince my wife. =C3=A2?~I want to test y=\r\nour existence&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; even&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; today.=C3=A2?T&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in th=\r\ne&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; morning with angry mood. What he told?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; =C3=A2?~ How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happene=\r\nd?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my =\r\nhome at 05.30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or =\r\n2 hours. Suddenly Thakur&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; pulled my blanket and told me th=\r\nat-=C3=A2?o Go to your friend=C3=A2?Ts&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; house. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; house=C3=A2?=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I immediately rushed to yo=\r\nur home. Thakur was guiding me the way&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; yo=\r\nur house and pushing me too. What\n you want? Why you are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; distu=\r\nrbing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him in such an early morning for such a silly thing=\r\ns?=C3=A2?T&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We both were so excited and surprised tha=\r\nt we had no words that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Morning.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I =\r\nwill never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Th=\r\nere&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur b=\r\nut I will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; write&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it sometime.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; earth.
