AOL came out with a=\r\n small book for \n&gt; &gt; doing Homam everyday, they started supplying Homa Kund=\r\nam and Cow-\n&gt; &gt; dung blocks for fire rituals. I Purchased the Homa Kundam a=\r\nnd \n&gt; &gt; CowDung Slices from them when i was in Mumbai and did my couple \nof=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Homam for MahaMrutunjaya Mantra. AOL has a giant numbers of \n&gt; &gt; foll=\r\nowers all over the world and its obvious that many people are \n&gt; &gt; doing Re=\r\ngulay Homam (As per AOL&#39;s way).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; around the same time Narasimha cam=\r\ne out with the first Manual and \n&gt; &gt; that was MahaGanapati Homa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; T=\r\nhis tells me that, Homam is NOT without reasons. Some divine \nplan \n&gt; &gt; is =\r\nstrongly behind this movement which is evident by activities \nof \n&gt; &gt; Manis=\r\nh & Narasimha, Ravishankar, Shri Maa and others who have \n&gt; &gt; started it on=\r\n regular basis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This were my thoughts. i suddenly realised a Yeste=\r\nrday the \n&gt; &gt; coincidence mentioned above and thought it proper to put in f=\r\nront \n&gt; of \n&gt; &gt; all the list.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Someone sent me a few snippets \n&gt; &gt; from an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; interview po=\r\nsted on her website. Please see below.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is interesting that =\r\nshe considers Ramakrishna Paramahamsa as \n&gt; &gt; her guru. It \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is intere=\r\nsting that Ramakrishna told her she had to &quot;do fire \n&gt; &gt; ceremonies and \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; show what is truth&quot; and &quot;at that time the whole world will be \n&gt; &gt; peac=\r\ne&quot;. This \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is similar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when s=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt; appeared to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him during Shata Chandi homam at Chennai.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She told him that many people are and will be born who will \n&gt; &gt; per=\r\nform a short \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fire ritual on a regular basis, establish sanatana dhar=\r\nma and \n&gt; &gt; peace in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; world and also make quick spiritual progres=\r\ns individually in \nthat \n&gt; &gt; process. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Shree Maa&#39;s statement about wh=\r\nat Ramakrishna told her is along \n&gt; &gt; similar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; lines.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; My=\r\n guru was also told by Mother that a few centres of regular \n&gt; &gt; Chandi hom=\r\nam \n&gt; &gt; &gt; should be established around the world, where Chandi homam is \n&gt; =\r\ndone \n&gt; &gt; 3 times a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; day. These places do not need to be near any tem=\r\nples or famous \n&gt; &gt; places and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; can be anywhere. The ritual need not =\r\nbe elaborate. For example, \n&gt; &gt; there is no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; need to offer silk saree=\r\ns etc in fire. A simple ritual with \nbare \n&gt; &gt; minimum \n&gt; &gt; &gt; offerings is =\r\nenough, but it needs to be performed 3 times \n&gt; &gt; everyday. When a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; f=\r\new such centres are established, it will apparently lead to a \n&gt; &gt; chain of=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; events that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\nough not 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam \n&gt; &gt; everyday=\r\n for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3 years in the same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; fantastic! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creat=\r\nes energy \nand \n&gt; &gt; brings \n&gt; &gt; &gt; deities to a place. While several ancient=\r\n temples are without \nany \n&gt; &gt; divine \n&gt; &gt; &gt; presence these days, new place=\r\ns of divine presence may be \ncreated \n&gt; &gt; by pure \n&gt; &gt; &gt; souls engaged in s=\r\nelfless sadhana for establishing dharma in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As=\r\n I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam \n&gt; &gt; during wh=\r\nich \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mother appeared and gave instructions to my guru on spreading \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; homam was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; taken on Ramakrishna&#39; s birth anniversary and the time =\r\nof \nsankalpa \n&gt; &gt; was within \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pra=\r\nvesha time of the birth \n&gt; &gt; anniversary. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; All of this was a coincide=\r\nnce and we were unaware of this \n&gt; &gt; significance when \n&gt; &gt; &gt; we decided th=\r\ne muhurta. It is interesting to know that \n&gt; Ramakrishna \n&gt; &gt; did \n&gt; &gt; &gt; me=\r\nntion fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and that his \n&gt; &gt; words are =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; similar to the words of Mother.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nar=\r\nasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \nhomam=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \ntarpan=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; F=\r\nree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free =\r\nJyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagan=\r\nnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She c=\r\nonsiders Shri Ramakrishna as her\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Master, has a small ashram here ne=\r\nar the Bay Area\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now here is the very interesting part (snip=\r\npets from her \nwebsite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pasted for your benefit), from an interview =\r\nfound here\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.shreemaa .org/drupal/ taxonomy_ menu/54/86\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Shree Maa: Ramakrishna, my Guru, was telling, =\r\n&quot;You have to go \n&gt; &gt; now for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our country, and all other country, yo=\r\nu have to go do fire \n&gt; &gt; ceremonies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and show what is truth, what i=\r\ns dignity, and at that time the \n&gt; &gt; whole\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world will be peace.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her main disciple is Swami Satyananda Saraswa=\r\nti (of American \n&gt; &gt; descent),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that same page describes his backgro=\r\nund, how he met her and \nall \n&gt; &gt; that;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but another interesting sni=\r\nppet in there:-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;At a time when journeying throughou=\r\nt Middle Asia was arduous \n&gt; at \n&gt; &gt; best,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he had traveled an unbea=\r\nten path to India&#39;s interior where he \n&gt; &gt; studied\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a number of=\r\n gurus, coming to embrace the worship of \nChandi \n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the sacre=\r\nd fire ceremony, the yagya, as his primary system of \n&gt; &gt; worship\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd meditation, while undertaking great austerities in the \n&gt; &gt; process.&quot;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;They undertook the Sahasra Chandi Yagya, a three year=\r\n fire \n&gt; &gt; ceremony\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and worship of the Goddess, without setting foo=\r\nt outside from \n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; humble temple grounds they established in Mar=\r\ntinez, \nCalifornia.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Add more friends to your messenger and enjoy=\r\n!
