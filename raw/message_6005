Now i use bigger homam kund and still when i use Brown til, few pops=\r\n out.\nI just collect them after homam and collect it in &quot;Nirmalya bag&quot; and =\r\ndispose it off at proper place.\n\nIf you use White Til, then there will not =\r\nbe any popping out of the seeds. It just burns without any sound.\n\nBest Reg=\r\nards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;alokbhat&quot; &lt;alokbhat@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Since a lot of technical questions regarding homam have been a=\r\nnswered of late by kind members who have accumulated vast knowledge and ric=\r\nh experiences and have taken the pains of sharing it with the larger group =\r\nI thought I might respectfully ask one which may or may not be a common occ=\r\nurrence. \n&gt; \n&gt; In homam I liberally offer black sesame (til) seeds in the d=\r\nivine fire. I did this in the past but of late I find that most offered see=\r\nds pop with a crackling noise and a good few shoot out of the homa kunda wi=\r\nth a trail of wisp of smoke and scatter about the floor. I do not put them =\r\nback in thinking anything rejected by Fire God should not be re-offered. I =\r\nwould be lying if I pretended that I am not apprehensive of the significati=\r\nons but my question really has to do with the practical aspect of how to pr=\r\nevent this.  I would be grateful to hear from others of their experiences o=\r\nf the same and how to alleviate it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; Alok.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
