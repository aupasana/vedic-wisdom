Shiva and Vishnu had unconditional l=\r\nove and devotion for each other. They are not like normal human beings and =\r\ntheir relationships, such as love and devotion, are not governed by petty n=\r\notions of superiority and dependence.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The Shaivite-Vaishnavite distin=\r\nctions and the biases of Kali yuga are unfortunate. Nevertheless, I am will=\r\ning to tolerate biases and closed-mindedness. Closed-mindedness is ok as lo=\r\nng as one is making some progress with one&#39;s own belief system.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *    =\r\n    *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; One climbing a mountain has to choose one of the avail=\r\nable paths. Whether one acknowledges that several mountain paths lead to th=\r\ne mountain top or whether one believes that only the path one has chosen le=\r\nads to the top, is not that important. As long as one is climbing the mount=\r\nain in one&#39;s chosen path, one is doing alright!\n&gt;  \n&gt; After all, there may =\r\nbe many paths around the hill. One may be unable to see paths on the other =\r\nside of the mountain or even distant paths on the same side. If one does no=\r\nt think much of those paths and focuses on climbing in one&#39;s own path, that=\r\n does no harm.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As one reaches the top, it gets narrower and one may s=\r\nee the other paths that seemed quite distant earlier to be quite nearby now=\r\n. As one is very close to the top, one will see that all paths are leading =\r\nthere. When one is on the top, one sees all paths to converge there. After =\r\ngod-realization, one sees various paths to be valid paths to god. Of course=\r\n, different paths come with different obstacles. One path may have some sno=\r\nw. One path may be too steep. One path may be slippery. One path may have f=\r\nalling rocks. One path may have fallen trees blocking it. And so on. But, o=\r\nne on the top knows that people can reach there using several paths, if the=\r\ny are committed to overcoming the obstacles and reaching the top.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let=\r\n people follow the paths chosen by them and wish them good luck to reach th=\r\ne top in their own paths. Let them say whatever they want to say about your=\r\n path. It does not matter. If YOU have conviction and faith, you just walk =\r\nyour path and reach the top!\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The problem is=\r\n that some people are doing no sadhana really, making no progress really an=\r\nd yet passing judgments on other paths and getting into fights. They are li=\r\nke people at the base of the mountain, trying to block people from some pat=\r\nhs and trying to enroll them in their path. They may fight with people and =\r\nkill them too. They stay at the base forever and never reach the top. They =\r\nare a problem.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But, people with narrow views who do some sadhana and =\r\nmake progress are ok. They are on some path and will eventually reach god. =\r\nFor example, so many Krishna bhaktas who look down upon Shiva as a lower de=\r\nmigod may be doing their mantra several malas a day with a good level of de=\r\nvotion and they will eventually make progress. I know Vaishnavas in some sa=\r\nmpradayas who do not even worship Ganesha as he is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family&quot; an=\r\nd worship Vishvaksena at the start of their poojas instead of Ganesha. But,=\r\n they do no harm to anyone, try to see all human beings as Vishnu&#39;s forms, =\r\ntry to serve all and keep their austerities. Bottomline is that they are do=\r\ning some sadhana and will eventually make progress.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let us not worry =\r\nabout people who are doing some sadhana and progressing. Any deficiencies i=\r\nn their understanding will be addressed in due course.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The bottomline=\r\n is: Keep doing enough sadhana to burn the conditioning and keep making pro=\r\ngress.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish L=\r\nessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam=\r\n and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;   =\r\n   Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;      Spiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; -------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I hardly disagree with your vi=\r\news but for Iskcon I have my own thoughts,no doubt on Shri Prabhupada and h=\r\nis mission to spread Shri Krishna&#39;s awareness but many times(After exit of =\r\nShri Prabhupada)on numerous occasions I found their views very biased towar=\r\nds Shri Shivji and for that reason I have my reservations and those views o=\r\nf mine are not my own views as some senior ex-Iskconites too share same vie=\r\nws like me.If I am allowed to speak I have seen very few shivites speaking =\r\nhard stuff like them for opposite side.(Shri Hari or Shri Krishna),not even=\r\n that well known astrologer Sanjay Rath once posted a separate procedures f=\r\nor Vaishnavas to do Mahamrityunjaya japam using Shri Veda Vyasa&#39;s name inst=\r\nead of Shri Vasishtha mantra(Vam Vasishthaya Namah) !

If you see an elephant yourself oneday, you will realize then that =\r\nbooks that seemed contradictory once are not that contradictory after all.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Srila Prabhupada was undoubtedly a great saint. To go abroad witho=\r\nut even knowing anyone there at an advanced age to spread Krishna bhakti, t=\r\no roam New York streets without proper shoes or clothing in winter, require=\r\ns tremendous surrender.

However, Srila Prabhupad=\r\na&#39;s commentary is fine too and it is perfect for people with certain samska=\r\nras.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sophisticated and complicated Upanishadic ideas are not palat=\r\nable to everyone.

In the former, on=\r\ne is cleaning up a dirty place that one is forced to live in. In the latter=\r\n, one is going to someone else&#39;s dirty place and cleaning it up. If there i=\r\ns some radioactive waste there and one is not protected, one may be affecte=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I keep saying, results of one&#39;s previous karmas are =\r\nlike fruits lying in a basket. One takes out one fruit after another and ea=\r\nts them. Some may be tasty and some may be bitter or rotten. When one does =\r\nrituals and other spiritual sadhana, the deities throw away some bad fruits=\r\n into a trash can and make one eat good fruits earlier than otherwise. But =\r\nthere may be some spillage as dirty fruits are thrown away. If a priest is =\r\nconducting the ritual, he may be affected by the spillage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and generated enough purity t=\r\no handle such things. Many priests of today do not do enough penance. They =\r\nare quite vulnerable as they start messing with other people&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, many priests of today who conduct poojas are not rea=\r\nlly brahmanas. Being born to a brahmana father is neither necessary nor suf=\r\nficient for one to become a brahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and =\r\nactions have to be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today think of power and i=\r\nnfluence over others or of money or of comforts. They are not thinking just=\r\n of knowledge and liberation. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there=\r\n are very very few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that ri=\r\ntuals can be performed for others only by brahmanas. What it means is that =\r\none desirous of power, influence, money and comforts is unfit to perform ri=\r\ntuals for others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, stop doing rituals for others. Or, do enough individual pena=\r\nnce when you are not doing rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a br=\r\nahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to=\r\n truly become a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras=\r\n, kshatriyas and vaisyas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding=\r\n mail 2 below on astrologers:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not an immature comm=\r\nent and there is an element of truth in it. A lot of what I said above appl=\r\nies here too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every action performed with ego (a sense of =\r\n&quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action of=\r\n giving advice to someone resulted in that person doing X instead of Y at k=\r\naarmik crossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in coming years, there is=\r\n clearly an action here. If the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doing th=\r\nis&quot;, then one is bound to experience the fruits of it. Some blessings can c=\r\nome and some sufferings can come too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Messing with someone=\r\n else&#39;s karmas is always a risky business.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the sol=\r\nution? Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifest=\r\nyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become=\r\n a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and =\r\nvaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become=\r\n a brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with =\r\nthe karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting ritual=\r\ns. Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about=\r\n brahmanas by conduct.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The above will become clear, if you=\r\n look at the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can b=\r\ne taught Jyotish!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyo=\r\ntish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fre=\r\ne &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http=\r\n://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/v=\r\nedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyotish=\r\nWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 1:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@=\r\n...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any curse(Shapa=\r\nm)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This I am asking after seeing the overall and general conditi=\r\non of Brahmanas specially those who do pujas for Yajmanas and involved in K=\r\narmakanda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if this is true is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the only place where we can discuss this subject henc=\r\ne I am posting this query here.Thanks a lot in advance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ma=\r\nil 2:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_y=\r\nhoo@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3=\r\n training sessions and am very eager to review my own chart. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However in numerous instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through frien=\r\nds and close uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse impact on your=\r\nself (astrologer) and yrou family. This may sound a very immature comment, =\r\nbut I thought I should get your opinion / thoughts on this before I proceed=\r\n on this journey.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I would appreciate getting a honest =\r\nresponse so I can put this issue to rest once and for all. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Raj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS: I am drawn to astolog=\r\ny more from an academic perspective of how it influences our life and how i=\r\ngnorant we are of this power around us. My goal is to get the little unders=\r\ntanding that I can of this marvelous science and educate our next generatio=\r\nn so they are not blinded by modern society and develop / retain respect fo=\r\nr astrology and our culture.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
