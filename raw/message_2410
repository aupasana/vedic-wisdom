This idol has its trunk to the rig=\r\nht side and has been there in our house since the last 56 years. I recently=\r\n came to know that when an idol of Shri Ganesha with its trunk to the right=\r\n is kept at home one needs to worship it daily in a dedicated way and we ha=\r\nve honestly not being doing this all these years. It was infact purchased b=\r\ny my grandmother 56 years ago as per my father who has been seeing it since=\r\n then. \n\nI feel that it is better to donate it to a temple which would wors=\r\nhip it daily. As it has been there for so long in the house we are feeling =\r\nhesitant about doing this. Would be extremely grateful if I could have advi=\r\nce as to what would be the correct thing to do and how to go about doing th=\r\ne same.\n\nKindly pardon me if this is not the appropriate forum for such a q=\r\nuery.\n\nThanks,\nRamesh M\nBangalore \n\n\n\n\n      Fitness on your mind?
