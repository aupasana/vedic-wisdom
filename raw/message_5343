Human body is naturall=\r\ny suited for an omnivorous diet. Just like \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people do not eat r=\r\naw meat, normally, people do not eat raw vegetables as well. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; C=\r\nooking is a later addition to human society. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you we=\r\nre to clear your mind of all preconcieved ideas and look at REAL \n&gt; &gt; &gt; res=\r\nearch in the most unbiased way possible, and accessed scientific papers in =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; clinical nutrition and dietetics, as latest as 2010 june/july, you w=\r\nould find \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ample evidence that humans as a speicies, for many milleni=\r\nums have relied on an \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; omnivorous diet:-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a) Human =\r\nancestral diets changed substantially approximately four to five \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mil=\r\nlion years ago with major climatic changes creating open grassland \n&gt; &gt; &gt; e=\r\nnvironments. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; b) Humans developed a larger brain balanc=\r\ned by a smaller, simpler \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gastrointestinal tract=C3=82  requiring=C3=\r\n=82 foods based around meat protein and fat. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;For \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; example=\r\n since the time of Australopithecus afarensis, some four to five million \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; years ago, brain size has increased threefold - chemical require=\r\nment for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain -=\r\n without a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; corresponding increase in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This =\r\nis possible only with \n&gt; &gt; &gt;a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; diet that is rich is animal prot=\r\nein. Simply put, in layman terms, our brain \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would not have reached t=\r\nhe size and mass as it is today, had it not been for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; diet comprising=\r\n of meat, fruits and vegetables. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; c) The gut morphology=\r\n of the human body as it stand todays is ideally \n&gt; &gt; &gt; equidistant from th=\r\nat of carnivores as well as herbivores. That is because \n&gt; &gt; &gt; humans are d=\r\nesigned to be omnivores. The lack of a well developed caecum and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rum=\r\nen, unlike herbivores, makes it difficult for the body to absorve plant \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; cellulose into usable energy, which is why, a=C3=82 major part of the l=\r\neafy \n&gt; &gt; &gt;vegetable \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; based diet eventually ends up as roughage=\r\n. On the other hand, the stomach \n&gt; &gt; &gt;lining \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of humans do not=\r\n contain=C3=82  the kind of strong acids which is present in a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;typica=\r\nl \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; carnivore. This is because, humans, diet as set by Nature th=\r\nrough=C3=82  the natural \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; process of evolution is supposed to b=\r\ne omnivorous. It may further interest you \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to know that the teet=\r\nh structure of humans is actually identical to, guess \n&gt; &gt; &gt;what, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; rats who also are omnivores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; d) It may shock many a precon=\r\ncieved and mistaken ideas that=C3=82 research into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; clinical nutritio=\r\nn very clearly indicates that absorption ability of the human \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; b=\r\nody for=C3=82 w.r.t different foods=C3=82 is highest (not vegetables or fru=\r\nits) for \n&gt; &gt; &gt;fish, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and lowest for red meat and carrots. Infa=\r\nct the later is considered negative \n&gt; &gt; &gt; calorie food, since it requires =\r\nthe body to waste more calories in absorving it \n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than the amoun=\r\nt it gains from them.
