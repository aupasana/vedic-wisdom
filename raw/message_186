People find their path,\n&gt; make some progress and then \n&gt; feel lost again.\n&gt; \n&gt; You run the drigdasa of Pisces from March 2008 to\n&gt; March 2017. Taking Cancer \n&gt; as progressed lagna in Pisces dasa, the 9th house\n&gt; will be strong with \n&gt; Mercury and Sun and the 9th lord Jupiter will be in\n&gt; lagna. The 8th house \n&gt; will be prominent with Mars and Ketu, with 8th lords\n&gt; Saturn and Rahu \n&gt; aspecting them from 2nd. These 4 malefics on the 8th\n&gt; house axis strongly \n&gt; suggest powerful mystical experiences.\n&gt; \n&gt; You are on the verge of a rewarding time spiritually\n&gt; speaking. Just keep \n&gt; your faith and patience for a few more years and\n&gt; keep doing your sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; The 5th house of devotion has Moon in rasi and\n&gt; vimsamsa. This shows devotion \n&gt; to Krishna. In navamsa, the 12th from atma karaka is\n&gt; empty and Mercury owns \n&gt; it. Mercury is in Scorpio with Rahu. This suggests\n&gt; that worship of Lord \n&gt; Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar incarnation) can give you fast\n&gt; spiritual progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please contact suresh.battar@...\n&gt; (http://ashramaustralia.net) and ask \n&gt; him where you can get a homa kundam in Australia.\n&gt; Swami Suresh Battar is a \n&gt; Hindu priest in Canberra. In case homa kundas are\n&gt; available there, he may be \n&gt; able to direct you. In the worst case, any square or\n&gt; circle shaped vessel \n&gt; with some depth (made of copper or bronze but not\n&gt; iron) can be used. Good \n&gt; luck for your homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding books, there are too many. But direct\n&gt; experience through \n&gt; meditation is a far better teacher than books. Just\n&gt; surrender to the Lord, \n&gt; accept wholeheartedly that all the diverse objects\n&gt; our senses perceive in \n&gt; this universe are all different manifestations of\n&gt; the Lord and that we are \n&gt; perceiving them differently because of our own\n&gt; impurity. If we keep \n&gt; reminding ourselves of this whenever our mind is\n&gt; overly attracted to or \n&gt; repelled by something, that itself is a very useful\n&gt; sadhana. In addition, if \n&gt; you spend a considerable time everyday in\n&gt; meditation, that too helps.\n&gt; \n&gt; For you, I strongly recommend &quot;Jnaneshwari&quot;, a\n&gt; commentary on BhagavadGita by \n&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj. This is a unique commentary by a\n&gt; unique saint, who is \n&gt; the re-incarnation of a rishi and had a direct\n&gt; dwaitic and adwaitic \n&gt; experience. There is a difference between writings\n&gt; coming from knowledge \n&gt; acquired by reading books or hearing from others and\n&gt; writings coming from \n&gt; the knowledge acquired in a direct experience. More\n&gt; than 700 years ago, \n&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj entered a cave in Alandi in his\n&gt; physical body at the age \n&gt; of 21 years and still meditating there. I have NOT\n&gt; read a more competent or \n&gt; sublime commentary on Krishna&#39;s teaching. It is\n&gt; quite an inspired work. A \n&gt; good English translation of this work is available\n&gt; at\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-Kripananda/dp/0911307648\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is the highest work on Hindu\n&gt; philosophy in my opinion. \n&gt; When Maharshi Viswamitra wanted Lord Ramachandra to\n&gt; come with him to forest, \n&gt; Rama was in confusion and a little pensive. In the\n&gt; presence of Maharshi \n&gt; Viswamitra, King Dasaratha and many other learned\n&gt; people, Maharshi Vasishtha \n&gt; imparted the essence of all Upanishats to Rama. His\n&gt; teachings were captured \n&gt; by Valmiki and the work is known as &quot;Yoga\n&gt; Vaasishtham&quot;. There is an inspired \n&gt; English translation available at\n&gt; \n&gt;\nhttp://www.amazon.com/Vasisthas-Yoga-Venkatesananda/dp/0791413640/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201988303&sr=1-1\n&gt; \n&gt; Various Puranas and Upanishats make a very useful\n&gt; reading too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality:\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3):\n&gt; http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows):\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:\n&gt; http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Sanjeev Narula&quot; &lt;san_narula@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, February 02, 2008 12:46 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Need more help\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji and all other aspirants.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Although this is my first writing in this group\n&gt; but i have been\n&gt; &gt; reading the threads for almost one year now. And\n&gt; you people have\n&gt; &gt; helped me a lot to find out the right path at many\n&gt; times but now i\n&gt; &gt; feel a bit lost again.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As it can be seen from my chart details what\n&gt; brought me here( and to\n&gt; &gt; spiritual path) like many others. I still remember\n&gt; the thread where\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha Ji said that there is no need to fear of\n&gt; Sani and now i have\n&gt; &gt; realised what he meant.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have learned a little bit of astrology from this\n&gt; thread and from\n&gt; &gt; other  sources but with that i can not really make\n&gt; any decisions of\n&gt; &gt; the path i need to follow. As i have seen that\n&gt; there are many\n&gt; &gt; enlightened and intelligent aspirants in this\n&gt; group so if\n&gt; &gt; someone(especially Narasimha Ji)can look at my\n&gt; chart and guide me i\n&gt; &gt; will be very thankful. My birth details are given\n&gt; below:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Birth Date- 17/03/1979\n&gt; &gt; Birth Time- 12:45 PM\n&gt; &gt; Birth Place- Ferozepur(Punjab), India\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Another thing is that till now i have been reading\n&gt; some\n&gt; &gt; Scriptures/Spiritual writings from here and there\n&gt; and doing some\n&gt; &gt; meditation and chanting of Mahamantra. I have\n&gt; really seen and\n&gt; &gt; experienced the effect of all this but all this\n&gt; was random and\n&gt; &gt; unplanned. Now i have come to a stage where i feel\n&gt; that my spiritual\n&gt; &gt; progress has stopped. So first of all i am\n&gt; thinking of reading more to\n&gt; &gt; get some knowledge but i have no idea what to read\n&gt; and from where to\n&gt; &gt; get the books.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Second thing is i am planning to do Mahaganapathi\n&gt; Homam on a regular\n&gt; &gt; basis so i have bought all the Materials Needed\n&gt; except the homa kundam\n&gt; &gt; which i could not find as i live in Australia so\n&gt; can anyone tell me\n&gt; &gt; what else can i use as i can not even dig a pit in\n&gt; the ground.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Although there are so many other things i want to\n&gt; ask but if someone\n&gt; &gt; can help me with only these i would be very\n&gt; thankful to him and i will\n&gt; &gt; pray to Lord for him.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt; &gt; Sanjeev\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n\n      ____________________________________________________________________________________\nLooking for last minute shopping deals?  \nFind them fast with Yahoo!
