In my little=C2=A0understanding, it is the=C2=A0goal which is=C2=A0God-re=\r\nalization, which is the=C2=A0only=C2=A0&quot;fundamental principle&quot;. Anything el=\r\nse is dispensable and therefore not eternal. Vedas, as all self-realized sa=\r\nints have told us, are about eternal truths, nothing short. \n=C2=A0\nIt will=\r\n be interesting here to point out that when some sections of samavedis when=\r\n they perform sraadham=C2=A0do the=C2=A0hormam on the palm of the bhokta br=\r\nahmin. It is called panihomam. Even the fire is not present there. It is ba=\r\nsed on a dictum called &quot; brahmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is=\r\n to be performed on the right hand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni=\r\n is ever present in the right hand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda=\r\n) brahmin. There is no defect here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify =\r\nthis and say that homa can be perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmi=\r\nn, then the problem arises.\n=C2=A0\nThank you for the interesting example ab=\r\nove. But I have a very pertinent question regarding this.=C2=A0 And what ex=\r\nactly does it mean by saying one learned in the Vedas? Can one, who=C2=A0ha=\r\ns mugged up the Vedas and a few commentaries of the same, without experienc=\r\ning any sort of self-realization, be called a &quot;srotriya&quot;? Does such a non-r=\r\nealized being have &quot;fire&quot; in his right hand? Never! \n=C2=A0\nA real &quot;srotriy=\r\na&quot; is one who has realized the Aatman, not in words, but in the states of s=\r\namadhi. Such a being &quot;may have&quot; spiritual abilities of fire in his &quot;palm&quot;. =\r\nAnyone else, irrespective of whether he is=C2=A0born in=C2=A0brhamin family=\r\n, is merely following a blind tradition without having experienced anything=\r\n and thus violating the essence of the Vedas and merely sticking to externa=\r\nl rules which have no spiritual consequence. What use is such=C2=A0a=C2=A0&#39;=\r\nvedic&#39; rituals, if at all they can be called as vedic. That which is devoid=\r\ne of the essence, is an empty shell which is bound to reform or perish in t=\r\nhe course of time. \n=C2=A0\nTherefore, for me, it hardly matters if the ritu=\r\nal is done on the bare palms or a gloved hands of a person who has never ex=\r\nperienced the Self. Both, are in clear violation of the Vedic essence.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nHomam is a ritualistic form of worship and if you bring in advaita vada=\r\n in it it doesn&#39;t work.\n=C2=A0\nThis is definitely incorrect! The vedic rish=\r\nis were famous for doing elaborate yagyas and homas. By extension of your a=\r\nbove logic, it means they did not believe in Advaita since they used to eng=\r\nage themselves in homas and yagyas?=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0\nVasistha spoke the Yoga V=\r\nasistham, which is a pinnacle of advaitha princples, and Ramayana speaks of=\r\n different yagyas performed by him and Vishwamitra.=C2=A0 Does it mean they=\r\n did not &quot;believe&quot; in advaita? \n=C2=A0\nYour above statement stems from an i=\r\nncorrect understanding of what is Advaitha Vada. As long as one is trapped =\r\nin duality, merely saying that I believe in Advaitha Vada does not make one=\r\n become so. I can keep believing that I am Bill Gates, but that=C2=A0won&#39;t =\r\nmake me Bill Gates. Rather=C2=A0I shall remain merely as a self deluded ent=\r\nity. Untill one actually experiences the state of non-duality, theoritical =\r\ntalk of &quot;All- is Brahman&quot; is self-delusion. \n=C2=A0\nAdwaith is a state to b=\r\ne achieve. It needs sustained and serious sadhana. No wonder the Rishis of =\r\nyore, who were all self-realized beings - and had experienced the state of=\r\n=C2=A0Advaitha - used to perform such long penances, including elaborate fi=\r\nre rituals on a daily basis. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nIt is not a question of whether=\r\n it is more elaborate or less elaborate or which is inferior or which is su=\r\nperior. It is a question of whether it is correct and based on what vedic a=\r\nuthority.\n=C2=A0\nThe question is not about being based on &quot;which vedic auth=\r\nority&quot; BUT, is the sadhana bearing fruits? Is it transforming the individua=\r\nl? Irrespective of which vedic &#39;authority&#39; says what, if a said sadhana is =\r\nnot leading to experiantial knowledge and states, it is useless for a genui=\r\nne sadhaka. Therefore, the only way to judge is to perform the sadhana and =\r\nexperience for oneself! And this is why there are so many who are already d=\r\noing the homas on a daily basis. Some have experienced paritally, some are =\r\nyet to. And each experience merely rivets one&#39;s mind to the sadhana more an=\r\nd more thus plunging in deeper and deeper. A sadhaka has little use for dry=\r\n theory. That which cannot be experienced, is of no consequence. It is this=\r\n perspective that any sadhana, not just the ones mentioned by Narasimha, ha=\r\ns to be judged by a genuine sadhaka. \n=C2=A0\n\n2. &quot;What I teach is ONE proce=\r\ndure for those who do not know any.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nAre there different ways you te=\r\nach a person to fly an aeroplane depending on what he knows and what he doe=\r\ns ?\n=C2=A0\nThe flying of the aeroplane is the same. The way one can learn i=\r\ns different based on the different models of the aeroplanes in which one le=\r\narns to fly!\n=C2=A0\n3. &quot;Knowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can=\r\n never be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing=\r\n impure or corrupt about it.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nRituals do evolve around desa and kaal=\r\na but if it starts evolving around paatra it is a dangerous trend.\n=C2=A0\nP=\r\naatra is a product of the desa and kaala, not uninfluenced by the other two=\r\n. That is why these three are used in tandem. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n4. &quot;The only k=\r\nnowledge that should (and can) be preserved without corruption is knowledge=\r\n that is *absolute*.

I am quoting the above mantras because they are c=\r\nommonly known.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nThis is the precisely the reason why maybe a V=\r\nivekananda had clearly stated that the available interpretations of the Ved=\r\nas do not do justice to it&#39;s essence. Selective words from here and there r=\r\neally do not prove that the Vedas are merely a set of rituals! This kind of=\r\n an intepretation leads to a fallacy where-in one celebrated western commen=\r\ntator on the Vedas believes that the Purusha shukta in an example of human-=\r\nscarfice practised in the Vedas. I am sure you will disagree with this. \n=\r\n=C2=A0\nCan you kindly enlighten us, why is Usha accorded an elevated status=\r\n? Usha is merely a dawn. What is so big deal about an average dawn, so much=\r\n so that one needs to address hymns to it? Or for that matter other pantheo=\r\nn of Vedic deities from the Rig Vedas, which to the cursory reader, gives a=\r\nn impression of mere nature worshipping pagan&#39;s attempting elevated poetry?=\r\n And if the average word by by word translations or a core ritualistic view=\r\n=C2=A0is all there is to the Vedas, pray enlighten, why is there is a gap i=\r\nn the philosophical structure between the so called pre-historic vedic hymn=\r\ns vs that of the Upanishadic period? And all the Upanishads seems to claim =\r\nall philosphical authority from the Vedas itself? How can this gap in the u=\r\nnderstanding of the two contexts be bridged, unless one takes an allegorica=\r\nl view of the recordings of=C2=A0 the Vedas, just like in the case of pre c=\r\nlassical Greek orphic-myths and their later day derivatives?\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n\nAny path, vedic, agamic, yogic, tantrik, aghori,=C2=A0if rightly followed =\r\nexclusively and fully can lead to the desired objective=C2=A0.

On the contrary, if you need t=\r\nhe sanction of vedic authority for it, please=C2=A0answer within the ambit =\r\nof vedic knowledge=C2=A0if doubts are raised.\n=C2=A0\nThe apprehension is th=\r\nat in the year 2000 you said,\n=C2=A0\n&quot;I cannot possibly finish this preface=\r\n without expressing my deep gratitude for my \nguru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who has=\r\n been a constant source of enlightenment, \nencouragement and inspiration. I=\r\n am eternally grateful to him&quot;\n=C2=A0\nand now you say\n=C2=A0\n&quot;In my well-co=\r\nnsidered view, Sanjay ji got some specific secrets and some generic guideli=\r\nnes (which may be imperfect, like with all other paramparas) from his elder=\r\ns. He then read some books and formed his understanding. As he started teac=\r\nhing it, he received a lot of adulation for the &quot;parampara secrets&quot;. I am a=\r\nfraid he got addicted to the adulation and started to manufacture &quot;parampar=\r\na secrets&quot; after the initial run. Slowly he became commercial and he starte=\r\nd selling manufactured &quot;parampara knowledge&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nYes, his teachings con=\r\ntain fascinating philosophization, which is really superficial and does not=\r\n stand any real scrutiny. His theories are like beautiful structures built =\r\nwith a pack of cards. Sanjay ji always maintains an air of &quot;I know more, bu=\r\nt will teach later&quot;. It is convenient to give the impression that there is =\r\nmore. If anything does not make sense, it could be because you have to lear=\r\nn more!\n=C2=A0\nAs he started exploiting and commercializing half-baked and =\r\nill-conceived knowledge in the name of a parampara, I took an exception to =\r\nthe commercialization and dishonesty. After expressing my reservations priv=\r\nately and having no effect, I started to go public, first subtly and later =\r\nbluntly. After several clashes, I was kicked out of SJC.\n=C2=A0\nWith basic =\r\nconcepts like houses, arudha padas, chara karakas, argalas etc, the generic=\r\n guidelines he received are imperfect. He deviates from Parasara in several=\r\n matters and his teachings do not work consistently.\n=C2=A0\nBottomline: San=\r\njay ji&#39;s base is made of some specific secrets (that are imperfect) and som=\r\ne generic guidelines (that are imperfect too). Starting from that base and =\r\nreading books, he hastily created a body of knowledge which he sells now. I=\r\nf there is anything in his teachings that can be used relatively reliably, =\r\nit is TP.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nIn 2000 you said\n=C2=A0\n\n&quot;Narayana dasa is a very importa=\r\nnt rasi dasa. It is a phalita dasa. It shows general\n\n\nresults. Narayana da=\r\nsa is computed differently for different divisional charts and we \ncan use =\r\nNarayana dasa of a divisional chart to predict matters related to that \ndiv=\r\nisional chart. \n=C2=A0 \nNarayana dasa is based on the progression of lagna =\r\nin one=E2=80=99s life. As one dasa ends \nand another starts, one rasi stops=\r\n being the progressed lagna and another rasi \nbecomes one=E2=80=99s progres=\r\nsed lagna. Using the progressed lagna as the reference, we \nfind out the ev=\r\nents that happen in that dasa. Thus we get twelve charts for each \nperson, =\r\nwith each chart applicable in one dasa. \n=C2=A0 \nThis is a very versatile d=\r\nasa system and readers sould pay attention to the details of \ncalculation. =\r\n&quot;\n=C2=A0\nnow you say\n=C2=A0\n&quot;Narayana dasa may be based on some genuine par=\r\nampara knowledge, but it does not work with any level of consistency. I am =\r\nafraid it needs refinement.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nYou seem to start teaching even before =\r\nyou=C2=A0start learning.=C2=A0I&#39; m only afraid it should not happen in the =\r\ncontext of vedic rituals also.

Suppose the protocol is s=\r\no complex that one cannot do it everyday and calls one&#39;s parents for a lunc=\r\nh once every few months.\n\nIs that better or is it better to relax the rules=\r\n and protocols to make it less formal and serve lunch to parents everyday?\n=\r\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its ow=\r\nn purity.\n&gt; Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty help to=\r\n preserve\n&gt; knowledge uncorrupted.\n\nThe only knowledge that should (and can=\r\n) be preserved without corruption is knowledge that is *absolute*. Veda, or=\r\n the knowledge of imperishable Self, alone is absolute knowledge.\n\nKnowledg=\r\ne of *external rituals* is relative and can never be absolute. It evolves b=\r\nased on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing impure or corrupt about it.\n\nAt=\r\n the end of the day, the key is whether one is actually doing some sadhana =\r\non a regular basis or not, whether it is causing internal transformation in=\r\n one or not, and whether it helps in one&#39;s spiritual progress or not.\n\n* * =\r\n*\n\nLet me cut & paste a section from a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occa=\r\nsion. It contains an analogy given earlier and addresses some relevant issu=\r\nes.\n\n------------ --------- --------\nDo Vedas Describe External Rituals\n\nSo=\r\nme people believe that Veda describes the specifics about various external =\r\nyagyas. Veda is supposed to be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge t=\r\nhat is not bound by desa-kaala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific ext=\r\nernal rituals be unbound by desa-kaala-paatra?\n\nThough Sayanacharya=E2=80=\r\n=99s celebrated commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo G=\r\nhose had a different take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His =\r\nview is that Veda talks about absolute truths about the inner self and not =\r\nrelative truths about external matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine =\r\nWill. That is why it is the immortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour eve=\r\nrything that is perishable and purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symb=\r\nolizes the divine Will, various offerings in it symbolize various aspects o=\r\nf one=E2=80=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passion=\r\ns and desires.\n\nMetaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam\n\nNotions that so and=\r\n so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya =\r\nritual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in perspective using a metaphor=\r\n.\n\nOnce there were many people who lived near the sea [Aatman]. They regula=\r\nrly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [absorbed in =\r\nAatman most of the time]. They described the sea in some nice cryptic poems=\r\n [Veda].\n\nAs people started living a little away from the sea [less spiritu=\r\nally evolved], someone had to put together some instructions on how to reac=\r\nh the sea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the instructions grew w=\r\nith time. People faithfully followed the instructions [rituals].\n\nPeople st=\r\narted moving further and further inland and started living in a landlocked =\r\ndesert far away from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of wate=\r\nr like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully performed the ritual of wal=\r\nking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether one=\r\n had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and formed different scho=\r\nols of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a buildi=\r\nng or some interesting object and even became satisfied that that was sea!\n=\r\n\nThen came some great person, whose instincts led him to take a horse inste=\r\nad of walking and ride it for a long distance [use of other tools]. He did =\r\nfind the sea after a few months. He put together newer instructions to reac=\r\nh the sea, which included riding a horse [new =C3=A4gama and tantra].\n\nPeop=\r\nle performing the old rituals objected to this and said &quot;but then this hors=\r\ne thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path and different=\r\n from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [pure Vedic ritual]. By now, people did not ev=\r\nen understand what the cryptic poems of the original &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, bu=\r\nt they simply believed that those poems taught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals t=\r\nhat they were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the original instr=\r\nuctions were meant for someone already close to sea and the newer instructi=\r\nons came from someone who actually saw the sea and knew where they currentl=\r\ny lived and how to get to the sea from there!\n\nSlowly many new sets of inst=\r\nructions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and many new paths to t=\r\nhe sea were outlined instead of just instructing people to walk towards eas=\r\nt [evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantras].\n\nOne particular path through jungl=\r\nes was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric paths involving practice of=\r\n sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea was much shorter through =\r\nthat jungle, it was just too dangerous and only the bravest and strongest c=\r\nould make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall i=\r\nn a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling to sea via that path were=\r\n killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory well came forward, condem=\r\nned that path and discouraged people from trying that path. Since then, eve=\r\nn people who were strong enough to successfully make it in that path desist=\r\ned from it.\n\nAs time progressed, people started fighting too much about who=\r\nse path was superior. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the orig=\r\ninal instructions, of either the so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-called=\r\n &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for the changed geography and changed time=\r\ns. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach=\r\n sea. Many did not even know that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the actual goal of=\r\n all their joirneys. They only thought they were supposed to follow the ins=\r\ntructions faithfully and there was no need to adopt to the changed geograph=\r\nical territory and time. They even condemned those who actually went to sea=\r\n, came back and gave updated directions for their place and time, for viola=\r\nting tradition.\n\nIn case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief summary =\r\nof its points. Veda is about realizing self. Vedic deities such as Agni, In=\r\ndra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slightly different aspects o=\r\nf Aatman. Veda describes various aspects of the state of self-realization. =\r\nThat is why it is considered the highest knowledge. Other allied subjects t=\r\nhrow some light on possible ways to reach that state. While definitive and =\r\nabsolute statements can be made on the actual state of self-realization its=\r\nelf, no definitive statements can be made on how to reach it. Only relative=\r\n statements can be made based on desa-kaala-paatra. The path depends on one=\r\n&#39;s current position!\n\nGreat men in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as=\r\n well as outside of it, came, experienced that state, understood the curren=\r\nt state of people around them and gave specific instructions on how to reac=\r\nh that state from the current state. Some followed the instructions and exp=\r\nerienced the state. Some instead kept arguing about the contradictions betw=\r\neen paths.\n\nStop Arguing and Do Sadhana\n\nAs the metaphor above illustrates,=\r\n arguments about various paths are irrelevant and distracting. What is impo=\r\nrtant is to pick a path and follow it. Whether one does a Vedic homam or an=\r\n Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The primary issues are whether one doe=\r\ns homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=80=99s focus is improving an=\r\nd how one is being transformed internally.\n\nJust as a twenty course meal ea=\r\nten once every six months does not give much energy to one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=\r\n=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once every six months or a year does=\r\n not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or material pursuits. Just as a small bo=\r\nwl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday gives more energy to one, a small=\r\n 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a boost to one=E2=80=99s spiritual =\r\nevolution.\n\nWise Tradeoffs\n\nSuppose the president of the country is visitin=\r\ng one for lunch with 100 associates. One can invite all the 100 associates =\r\nof the President by name and seat them in the room individually, following =\r\nvarious protocols. Then one can exchange long pleasantries with the Preside=\r\nnt and then offer lunch.\n\nSuppose one is in a hurry and has very little tim=\r\ne. If one still invites all the 100 associates by name and seats them in th=\r\ne room individually following the protocol and does not have enough time to=\r\n let the President eat lunch in the end, is it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wi=\r\nser to invite all the 100 associates together and seat them together by vio=\r\nlating the protocol and use that time to let the President eat in peace?\n\nS=\r\nimilarly, is it wise if one exchanges long pleasantries and gives very litt=\r\nle time to eat? Or should one cut short on the pleasantries and give more t=\r\nime to eat?\n\nIn a fire ritual, making offerings to the main deity is the pr=\r\nimary part. Various upacharas done to the deity before the offerings commen=\r\nce is secondary. Various preliminary and final steps and offerings to assoc=\r\niate deities are tertiary. If one has a few hours for the fire ritual, one =\r\ncan do everything given in scriptures leisurely. If one has only 20-30 minu=\r\ntes, one needs to make wise tradeoffs and maximize the benefit. It is far b=\r\netter than doing nothing.\n\n&lt;sections deleted&gt;\n\nProof of the Pudding\n\nAt thi=\r\ns time, more than hundred people are doing a homam to some deity or the oth=\r\ner, everyday. Spending time worshipping god in fire for 20-30 min (or more)=\r\n everyday, with an attitude of surrender and with some basic intellectual u=\r\nnderstanding of the absolute truths expounded by Veda and Upanishads, can d=\r\no a world of good to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution. The proof of the pu=\r\ndding is in eating it. One can try to perform a short homam everyday for a =\r\nfew months and see for oneself if there is a difference in one=E2=80=99s at=\r\ntitude, focus and clarity of thinking.\n------------ --------- --------\n\nBes=\r\nt regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- -\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;=\r\nDo It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst rologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms=\r\n.org\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish wr=\r\nitings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n---- moulamagamagguru &lt;moul=\r\namagamagguru@ yahoo.in&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Members,\n&gt; \n&gt; At the outset, thanks =\r\nto Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for guiding me into this forum. I had posted a messa=\r\nge in jHora in response to a forward from Jyotishwritings on &quot;efficacy of r=\r\nemedies&quot;. I humbly agree that jHora is not the right forum for discussing t=\r\nhese topics.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have gone through the homam manual provided by Sri.Nara=\r\nsimhaji and the video of a homam being performed and have the following obs=\r\nervations to make.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. As per rules laid out by srouta and gruhya sutra=\r\ns which describe the preocedures for various rituals, any yajna (homam) can=\r\n only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (which is the prakruti of all yaj=\r\nnas).\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. All steps in darsapoornamasa should be there in the homam pro=\r\ncedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka form, but it has to be there). =\r\nWe are nobody to judge which are essential and which are not essential. The=\r\ny are laid down by vedas and later elaborated by acharyas.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. There ar=\r\ne variations in procedures in the different sutras such as apastamba sutra,=\r\n bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no omissions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. The ordin=\r\nary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee etc. become worthy of divine =\r\nusage only when they are divinised using the right procedure. Then only it =\r\nbecomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as named. =\r\nI suggest reading of the volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get a insi=\r\nght into the importance of these steps.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. The procedure in the manual=\r\n is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There are large deviations and om=\r\nissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantrik procedures. \n&gt; \n&gt; 6. In p=\r\naristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kunda there is a particular mann=\r\ner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are tucked under the bottom of t=\r\nhe prceeding ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7. The direction for sprinkling water (mantra paris=\r\nhkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be from S=\r\nE corner to NE corner. This can not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas=\r\n. It is in a circle starting from NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaad=\r\ni eeshaantam).\n&gt; \n&gt; 8 Patraasadanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used =\r\nin the vessel above darbha is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 9.Prokshanee samskaram and prok=\r\nshanam for purification of the utensils is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 10. Patra samskara=\r\nm or purifying the utensils is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna=\r\n avahanam on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneet=\r\na with darbha) is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha bra=\r\nhma) is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 13. Ajya samskaram or purification of the ghee and pa=\r\nryagnikaranam of the homa dravya used for havan is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 14. Darvee=\r\n samskaram or purification of ladles used in the homam is missing. Always t=\r\no spoons are to be used (sruksruvou) .\n&gt; \n&gt; 15. Placement of paridhi and aa=\r\ngharasamit is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 16. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed numb=\r\ner of samits in the agni iis missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 17. It is seen in the video that=\r\n with a single dip of the ladle in the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in d=\r\nrops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise =\r\nit will lead to dravyalopa.\n&gt; \n&gt; and many more ............\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. Strict=\r\nly speaking, in the vedic procedure the deity is not invoked into agni. Agn=\r\ni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as carrier for the other gods (havy=\r\na vahaka). Depending on the name of deity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni c=\r\narries the offering to the particular deity. If at all deity is invoked it =\r\nis gaunam (secondary or not necessary)\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. In the tantrik procedure, t=\r\nhe deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni acts either as the jadharag=\r\nni of the deity or the agni itself is converted into the deity (agnyatmaka)=\r\n by offering the specified agni devata aikya ahutis.\n&gt; \n&gt; 19. Very good alt=\r\nernate homa procedures are available in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra mah=\r\narnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They don&#39;t involve veda mantras so =\r\nthat you don&#39;t have to struggle to get the right pronunciation and svaras. =\r\nThese procedures are designed for mantra sadhakas who perform homam on thei=\r\nr own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom homam for any devata.\n&gt; \n&gt; 20.=\r\n Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can be le=\r\narned from a video. It involves learning from an able guru and practice wit=\r\nh devotion, precision and perfection.\n&gt; \n&gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve e=\r\nach branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybrids may not always yield goo=\r\nd results. Let almighty help to preserve knowledge uncorrupted.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1533397651-1277046973=:17786\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Shri.Rajarshiji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;Upanishads seems to claim all philosphical authority from the V=\r\nedas itself&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Upanishads or their vyakhyanas ?=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Do you accept that there is a structural divi=\r\nde between the corpus veda called the samhita and the upanishads or not ?

In my little&nbsp;understanding, it is the&nbsp;goal which is&nb=\r\nsp;God-realization, which is the&nbsp;only&nbsp;&quot;fundamental principle&quot;. An=\r\nything else is dispensable and therefore not eternal. Vedas, as all self-re=\r\nalized saints have told us, are about eternal truths, nothing short. &lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;It will be interesting here to point out that w=\r\nhen some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham&nbsp;do the&nbsp;=\r\nhormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam. Even the =\r\nfire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called &quot; brahmanasya dak=\r\nshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to be performed on the right hand of th=\r\ne brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right hand of th=\r\ne srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect here. It i=\r\ns as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be perfromed =\r\non the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for the interesting example above.=\r\n But I have a very pertinent question regarding this.&nbsp; And what exactl=\r\ny does it mean by saying one learned in the Vedas? Can one, who&nbsp;has mu=\r\ngged up the Vedas and a few commentaries of the same, without experiencing =\r\nany sort of self-realization, be called a &quot;srotriya&quot;? Does such a non-reali=\r\nzed being have &quot;fire&quot; in his right hand? Never! &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;A real &quot;srotriya&quot; is one who has &lt;EM&gt;realized &lt;/EM&gt;the Aatman, not in wo=\r\nrds, but in the states of samadhi. Such a being &quot;may have&quot; spiritual abilit=\r\nies of fire in his &quot;palm&quot;. Anyone else, irrespective of whether he is&nbsp;=\r\nborn in&nbsp;brhamin family, is merely following a blind tradition without =\r\nhaving experienced anything and thus violating the essence of the Vedas and=\r\n merely sticking to external rules which have no spiritual consequence. Wha=\r\nt use is such&nbsp;a&nbsp;&#39;vedic&#39; rituals, if at all they can be called as =\r\nvedic. That which is devoide of the essence, is an empty shell which is bou=\r\nnd to reform or perish in the course of time. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;Therefore, for me, it hardly matters if the ritual is done on the bare pal=\r\nms or a gloved hands of a person who has never experienced the Self. Both, =\r\nare in clear violation of the Vedic essence.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nEM&gt;Homam is a ritualistic form of worship and if you bring in advaita vada =\r\nin it it doesn&#39;t work.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;This is d=\r\nefinitely incorrect! The vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborate yagya=\r\ns and homas. By extension of your above logic, it means they did not believ=\r\ne in Advaita since they used to engage themselves in homas and yagyas?&nbsp=\r\n; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Vasistha spoke the Yoga Vasistham, which is=\r\n a pinnacle of advaitha princples, and Ramayana speaks of different yagyas =\r\nperformed by him and Vishwamitra.&nbsp; Does it mean they did not &quot;believe&quot;=\r\n in advaita? &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Your above statement stems from =\r\nan incorrect understanding of what is Advaitha Vada. As long as one is trap=\r\nped in duality, merely saying that I believe in Advaitha Vada does not make=\r\n one become so. I can keep believing that I am Bill Gates, but that&nbsp;wo=\r\nn&#39;t make me Bill Gates. Rather&nbsp;I shall remain merely as a self deluded=\r\n entity. Untill one actually experiences the state of non-duality, theoriti=\r\ncal talk of &quot;All- is Brahman&quot; is self-delusion. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;Adwaith is a state to be achieve. It needs sustained and serious sadhana=\r\n. No wonder the Rishis of yore, who were all self-realized beings - and had=\r\n experienced the state of&nbsp;Advaitha - used to perform such long penance=\r\ns, including elaborate fire rituals on a daily basis. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;It is not a question of whether it =\r\nis more elaborate or less elaborate or which is inferior or which is superi=\r\nor. It is a question of whether it is correct and based on what vedic autho=\r\nrity.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The question is not about =\r\nbeing based on &quot;which vedic authority&quot; BUT, is the sadhana bearing fruits? =\r\nIs it transforming the individual? Irrespective of which vedic &#39;authority&#39; =\r\nsays what, if a said sadhana is not leading to experiantial knowledge and s=\r\ntates, it is useless for a genuine sadhaka. Therefore, the only way to judg=\r\ne is to perform the sadhana and experience for oneself! And this is why the=\r\nre are so many who are already doing the homas on a daily basis. Some have =\r\nexperienced paritally, some are yet to. And each experience merely rivets o=\r\nne&#39;s mind to the sadhana more and more thus plunging in deeper and deeper. =\r\nA sadhaka has little use for dry theory. That which cannot be experienced, =\r\nis of no consequence. It is this perspective that any sadhana, not just the=\r\n ones mentioned by Narasimha, has to be judged by a genuine sadhaka. &lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;2. &quot;What I teach is ONE procedur=\r\ne for those who do not know any.&quot;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Are there different ways you teach a person to fly an aeroplane depen=\r\nding on what he knows and what he does ?&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The flying of the aeroplane is the same. The way one can learn is =\r\ndifferent based on the different models of the aeroplanes in which one lear=\r\nns to fly!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;3. &quot;Knowledge of *external ritu=\r\nals* is relative and can never be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-=\r\npaatra. There is nothing impure or corrupt about it.&quot;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Rituals do evolve around desa and kaala but if it=\r\n starts evolving around paatra it is a dangerous trend.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM=\r\n&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Paatra is a product of the desa and kaala, not unin=\r\nfluenced by the other two. That is why these three are used in tandem. &lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;4. &quot;The only knowledge that=\r\n should (and can) be preserved without corruption is knowledge that is *abs=\r\nolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperishable Self, alone is absolute know=\r\nledge. Knowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can never be absolut=\r\ne&quot;.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sir, honestly, have you =\r\never read the vedas to know what is inside them ? or for that matter the Sa=\r\nyana bhashya&lt;/EM&gt;. &lt;EM&gt;other than in the ritualistic context. I am quoting =\r\nthe above mantras because they are commonly known.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;This is the precisely the rea=\r\nson why maybe a Vivekananda had clearly stated that the available interpret=\r\nations of the Vedas do not do justice to it&#39;s essence. Selective words from=\r\n here and there really do not prove that the Vedas are merely a set of ritu=\r\nals! This kind of an intepretation leads to a fallacy where-in one celebrat=\r\ned western commentator on the Vedas believes that the Purusha shukta in an =\r\nexample of human-scarfice practised in the Vedas. I am sure you will disagr=\r\nee with this. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Can you kindly enlighten us, wh=\r\ny is Usha accorded an elevated status? Usha is merely a dawn. What is so bi=\r\ng deal about an average dawn, so much so that one needs to address hymns to=\r\n it? Or for that matter other pantheon of Vedic deities from the Rig Vedas,=\r\n which to the cursory reader, gives an impression of mere nature worshippin=\r\ng pagan&#39;s attempting elevated poetry? And if the average word by by word tr=\r\nanslations or a core ritualistic view&nbsp;is all there is to the Vedas, pr=\r\nay enlighten, why is there is a gap in the philosophical structure between =\r\nthe so called pre-historic vedic hymns vs that of the Upanishadic period? A=\r\nnd all the Upanishads seems to claim all philosphical authority from the Ve=\r\ndas itself? How can this gap in the understanding of the two contexts be br=\r\nidged, unless one takes an allegorical view of the recordings of&nbsp; the =\r\nVedas, just like in the case of pre classical Greek orphic-myths and their =\r\nlater day derivatives?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Any path, vedic, agamic, yogic, tantrik, aghori,&nbsp;if righ=\r\ntly followed exclusively and fully can lead to the desired objective&nbsp;.=\r\n But mixing up of paths could be disastrous.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;No. Many self-realized people have &#39;mixed&#39; these artifically crea=\r\nted boundaried and achived and experienced higher states.

If so, which authoritative text have you relied upon? Or is it one de=\r\nsigned by yourself keeping the convenience factor in mind ?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;There are many procedures even within the vedic system for pe=\r\nrforming homam. Each established procedure given by acharyas&nbsp; is compl=\r\nete&nbsp;in itself and do not violate the fundamental principles of vedic r=\r\nituals.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;It will be interesting here to point o=\r\nut that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham&nbsp;do =\r\nthe&nbsp;hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panihomam. =\r\nEven the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called &quot; brahma=\r\nnasya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to be performed on the right h=\r\nand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the right h=\r\nand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no defect h=\r\nere. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa can be p=\r\nerfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arises.&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As you have said, any system of worship is accept=\r\nable. There are so many religions and cults all around the world. Nobody ob=\r\njects. If you call something vedic, please make sure that it conforms to th=\r\ne vedic tenets.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Homam is a ritualistic form of=\r\n worship and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn&#39;t work.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;It is not a question of whether it is more elaborate or =\r\nless elaborate or which is inferior or which is superior. It is a question =\r\nof whether it is correct and based on what vedic authority. If you are prom=\r\noting this homa procedure as one of your own design, there is no objection.=\r\n On the contrary, if you need the sanction of vedic authority for it, pleas=\r\ne&nbsp;answer within the ambit of vedic knowledge&nbsp;if doubts are raised=\r\n.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The apprehension is that in the year 2000 yo=\r\nu said,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTimes-Roman&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;&quot;I=\r\n cannot possibly finish this preface without expressing my deep gratitude f=\r\nor my \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who has been a constant source=\r\n of enlightenment, \n&lt;DIV&gt;encouragement and inspiration. I am eternally grat=\r\neful to him&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;and now you say&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some specific secret=\r\ns and some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, like with all other =\r\nparamparas) from his elders. He then read some books and formed his underst=\r\nanding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of adulation for the &quot;=\r\nparampara secrets&quot;. I am afraid he got addicted to the adulation and starte=\r\nd to manufacture &quot;parampara secrets&quot; after the initial run. Slowly he becam=\r\ne commercial and he started selling manufactured &quot;parampara knowledge&quot;.&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Yes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophi=\r\nzation, which is really superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. H=\r\nis theories are like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanja=\r\ny ji always maintains an air of &quot;I know more, but will teach later&quot;. It is =\r\nconvenient to give the impression that there is more. If anything does not =\r\nmake sense, it could be because you have to learn more!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As he started exploiting and commercializing half-baked and ill-c=\r\nonceived knowledge in the name of a parampara, I took an exception to the c=\r\nommercialization and dishonesty. After expressing my reservations privately=\r\n and having no effect, I started to go public, first subtly and later blunt=\r\nly. After several clashes, I was kicked out of SJC.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;With basic concepts like houses, arudha padas, chara karakas, argalas=\r\n etc, the generic guidelines he received are imperfect. He deviates from Pa=\r\nrasara in several matters and his teachings do not work consistently.&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Bottomline: Sanjay ji&#39;s base is made of some specif=\r\nic secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that are imper=\r\nfect too). Starting from that base and reading books, he hastily created a =\r\nbody of knowledge which he sells now. If there is anything in his teachings=\r\n that can be used relatively reliably, it is TP.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;In 2000 you said&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTimes-Roman&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;&quot;Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa.

Narayana dasa is computed differently for differ=\r\nent divisional charts and we \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;can use Narayana dasa of a di=\r\nvisional chart to predict matters related to that \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;division=\r\nal chart. \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;Narayana dasa is based o=\r\nn the progression of lagna in one=E2=80=99s life. As one dasa ends \n&lt;P alig=\r\nn=3Dleft&gt;and another starts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna and =\r\nanother rasi \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;becomes one=E2=80=99s progressed lagna. Using=\r\n the progressed lagna as the reference, we \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;find out the ev=\r\nents that happen in that dasa. Thus we get twelve charts for each \n&lt;P align=\r\n=3Dleft&gt;person, with each chart applicable in one dasa. \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;&n=\r\nbsp; \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;This is a very versatile dasa system and readers soul=\r\nd pay attention to the details of \n&lt;DIV&gt;calculation. &quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;now you say&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;Narayana dasa may be bas=\r\ned on some genuine parampara knowledge, but it does not work with any level=\r\n of consistency. I am afraid it needs refinement.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;You seem to start teaching even before you&nbsp;start learning.&nbsp;I=\r\n&#39; m only afraid it should not happen in the context of vedic rituals also. =\r\nFrom the pronunciation &nbsp;of the person who is performing the homam in t=\r\nhe video, it is quite obvious that he is at an entry level.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;If you agree that you are not trying to propagate vedic knowl=\r\nedge, I have no more points&nbsp; to make.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;2. &quot;What I teach is ONE procedure for thos=\r\ne who do not know any.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Are there different wa=\r\nys you teach a person to fly an aeroplane depending on what he knows and wh=\r\nat he does ?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;3. &quot;Knowledge of *external ritual=\r\ns* is relative and can never be absolute.

There is nothing impure or=\r\n corrupt about it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the end of the day, the key is whether one is =\r\nactually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or not, whether it is causin=\r\ng internal transformation in one or not, and whether it helps in one&#39;s\n spi=\r\nritual progress or not.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let me cut &amp; paste a sectio=\r\nn from a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an analogy g=\r\niven earlier and addresses some relevant issues.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ ------=\r\n--- --------&lt;BR&gt;Do Vedas Describe External Rituals&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some people belie=\r\nve that Veda describes the specifics about various external yagyas. Veda is=\r\n supposed to be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not boun=\r\nd by desa-kaala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific external rituals b=\r\ne unbound by desa-kaala-paatra?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebr=\r\nated commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a =\r\ndifferent take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is tha=\r\nt Veda talks about absolute truths about the inner self and not relative tr=\r\nuths about external matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That =\r\nis why it is the immortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything tha=\r\nt is\n perishable and purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the=\r\n divine Will, various offerings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=\r\n=80=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and de=\r\nsires.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Metaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Notions that so=\r\n and so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric ya=\r\ngya ritual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in perspective using a meta=\r\nphor.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once there were many people who lived near the sea [Aatman]. T=\r\nhey regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [ab=\r\nsorbed in Aatman most of the time]. They described the sea in some nice cry=\r\nptic poems [Veda].&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As people started living a little away from the s=\r\nea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instruction=\r\ns on how to reach the sea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the ins=\r\ntructions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions\n [rit=\r\nuals].&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;People started moving further and further inland and started =\r\nliving in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had ne=\r\nver seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully perf=\r\normed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They debate=\r\nd endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles an=\r\nd formed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, f=\r\nound a tree or a building or some interesting object and even became satisf=\r\nied that that was sea!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then came some great person, whose instincts =\r\nled him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance =\r\n[use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put togeth=\r\ner newer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new =\r\n=C3=A4gama and tantra].&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;People performing the old rituals objected t=\r\no this and said &quot;but then this horse thing is not granted by the\n book of s=\r\nea. This is a new path and different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [pure Vedi=\r\nc ritual]. By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems of=\r\n the original &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed that those poems=\r\n taught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissf=\r\nully unaware that the original instructions were meant for someone already =\r\nclose to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who actually saw =\r\nthe sea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from =\r\nthere!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, chario=\r\nts etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead of j=\r\nust instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/ ya=\r\nntras].&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora an=\r\nd other dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Thou=\r\ngh the distance to sea was much shorter through that\n jungle, it was just t=\r\noo dangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. There were c=\r\nruel dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many=\r\n weak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who kn=\r\new the entire territory well came forward, condemned that path and discoura=\r\nged people from trying that path. Since then, even people who were strong e=\r\nnough to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As time=\r\n progressed, people started fighting too much about whose path was superior=\r\n. They were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, o=\r\nf either the so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-called &quot;new&quot; path or other=\r\n variations, for the changed geography and changed times. Many followed the=\r\n instructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not e=\r\nven know that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the actual goal of all their joirneys.=\r\n They only thought they were supposed to\n follow the instructions faithfull=\r\ny and there was no n\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
