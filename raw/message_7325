The last tarpana that is offered is some\n&gt; variant of &quot;aa-brahma-stamba-paryantam jagat tRpyatu&quot;. i.e. May the whole\n&gt; world be pleased. There are plenty of quotes from standard dharma shastras\n&gt; which support this. In fact, this is the standard\n&gt; &quot;super-duper-short-tarpana&quot; method !\n&gt;\n&gt; We are born into this world with debts ... including pitR Rna which\n&gt; strongly influences us. You should share your wealth with everyone, but it\n&gt; does make sense to start off repaying the debts that you owe. Most of us are\n&gt; spiritually bankrupt and these debt vAsanAs strongly bind us to this world.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that is when we look for other learned&#39;s inputs or shastra&#39;s inputs.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; There are too many inputs which say contradictory things. We have to to\n&gt; make some limited use of our intellect as long as we are in this world of\n&gt; duality. Understanding shastra is not easy. At some point, intellect gives\n&gt; way to anubhava, but until then, we have no other choice.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; On the root of the tree example, I was going with this\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; The example is fine, but it is important to realize that, like all\n&gt; examples, it has limits. Krishna is karma-phala-dAtA, and we have to\n&gt; experience what we, through previous actions, have begged him to let us\n&gt; experience. When we are ready to wholeheartedly accept Krishna with\n&gt; unflinching bhakti, we are made. The reality is that we don&#39;t possess such\n&gt; bhakti, and we are strongly influenced by those around us ... particularly\n&gt; those whom we have RnAnubandha with ... like our forefathers. You can change\n&gt; a lot of things, but changing your DNA is hard. Thus, for the 99.99% of us\n&gt; with less than perfect bhakti, rituals like pitR karma are useful.\n&gt;\n&gt; When you do pitR karma, if you choose to identify strongly with the pitRs,\n&gt; you will go to pitR loka. Similarly with other beings like yakshas,\n&gt; gandharvas etc. But, the point of tarpana is exactly the opposite. Rather\n&gt; than identifying with the pitRs, we are trying to detach ourselves from them\n&gt; and their influences. This will do nothing but help us to cultivate true\n&gt; bhakti and reach our final goal sooner.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is important to understand the intent of the ritual and perform it\n&gt; accordingly.\n&gt;\n&gt; sasneham,\n&gt;\n&gt;    ajit\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; On Sat, Sep 24, 2011 at 7:59 AM, Rama V &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again every example is taken by the followers as they wish to :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Let me read / twist your example - &quot;my grand father likes sweets, so I will\n&gt; not give tarpanam using sesame seeds + water&quot;. Then we talk of rules what\n&gt; must be done to the departed, why only sesame, etc. So, the rule here is the\n&gt; existing parent gets the permission / authority or whatever we want to call\n&gt; it, to please his ancestors who are departed. When the ancestors are alive,\n&gt; any one can meet him; even his uncles, friends, neighbours, etc. If by the\n&gt; same logic, any one can do tarpanam to anyone, I have no issues, just that I\n&gt; am not yet convinced :-)\n&gt;\n&gt; Like I mentioned, to each his / her own. Frankly, I have seen mundane logic\n&gt; stops somewhere for most of the rituals; that is when we look for other\n&gt; learned&#39;s inputs or shastra&#39;s inputs.\n&gt;\n&gt; Again, I am merely stating what I was told as even I was prepared to start\n&gt; tarpanam for this pitr paksha until I was told and realized it is against\n&gt; some shastras.\n&gt;\n&gt; On the root of the tree example, I was going with this,\n&gt; http://www.asitis.com/9/25.html\n&gt;\n&gt; Without flaming on the devas != demigods :-), if there are any insights you\n&gt; can offer on why Lord mentioned it like this from any other angle, it will\n&gt; be much appreciated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Lastly, thanks for your inputs.\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt; rAma\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Rama,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; an acting CEO or acting prime minister does not exist when the real CEO\n&gt; or\n&gt; &gt; PM exists.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; So the tarpanam has to be done by the generation that is alive; if\n&gt; father,\n&gt; &gt; else son.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This kind of analogy may be relevant if one is trying to exercise one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; authority and power over another. However, we are discussing tarpana\n&gt; &gt; (literally &quot;to please&quot;). In the presence of a living father, a better\n&gt; &gt; analogy is that of &quot;going to visit a grandfather who lives elsewhere&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; Certainly, the father should visit the grandfather. Does this mean that\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; grandson should not visit the grandfather? And, when it comes to pleasing\n&gt; &gt; the grandfather, is there a monopoly? Most grandparents get a special\n&gt; kind\n&gt; &gt; of a pleasure from their grandkids. All analogies have their limits, but\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; CEO analogy, IMO, misses the point.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Pouring water to the roots takes care of the whole of the plant / tree.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When all other circumstances and factors are conducive to it, merely\n&gt; pouring\n&gt; &gt; water to the roots takes care of the tree. This is not as easy as it\n&gt; &gt; seems. Most trees from India will not survive the cold weather of North\n&gt; &gt; America ... regardless of how much you water it. In advaita, mere gyana\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; necessary ... but it takes lifetimes of strenuous karma yoga to reach\n&gt; this\n&gt; &gt; point. Merely reciting a mantra is sufficient ... but it takes lifetimes\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; develop the perfect bhakti that must accompany it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Looks like to each his / her own.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Those who feel strongly can certainly start with the deva and rishi\n&gt; tarpana\n&gt; &gt; :-)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; sasneham,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;    ajit\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; On Sat, Sep 24, 2011 at 12:39 AM, Rama V &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One learned person I know gave an example that an acting CEO or acting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; prime minister does not exist when the real CEO or PM exists.

Similarly with other beings like yakshas, gandharvas etc. But, the point =\r\nof tarpana is exactly the opposite. Rather than identifying with the pitRs,=\r\n we are trying to detach ourselves from them and their influences. This wil=\r\nl do nothing but help us to cultivate true bhakti and reach our final goal =\r\nsooner.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;It is important to understand the inte=\r\nnt of the ritual and perform it accordingly.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;sasne=\r\nham,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0 =A0ajit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;On Sat, Sep 24, 2011 at 7:59 AM, Rama V &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vsra_prasad@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_b=\r\nlank&quot;&gt;vsra_prasad@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;b=\r\norder-left:1px solid rgb(204, 204, 204)&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\nNamaste.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAgain every =\r\nexample is taken by the followers as they wish to :-)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nLet me read =\r\n/ twist your example - &quot;my grand father likes sweets, so I will not gi=\r\nve tarpanam using sesame seeds + water&quot;.

When the ancestors are alive=\r\n, any one can meet him; even his uncles, friends, neighbours, etc. If by th=\r\ne same logic, any one can do tarpanam to anyone, I have no issues, just tha=\r\nt I am not yet convinced :-)&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nLike I mentioned, to each his / h=\r\ner own.

In the presence of a living father, a better&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; analogy is that of &quot;going to visit a grandfather who lives el=\r\nsewhere&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Certainly, the father should visit the grandfather.=\r\n Does this mean that the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; grandson should not visit the grandfather=\r\n?
