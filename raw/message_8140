After, i got two children, i took the practise.\nHumility: Yes, alwa=\r\nys humiliated, whenever i get abusive thoughts, i do situps, stand infront =\r\nof god and ask for forgiveness.\nReciting stotras: I recite lalitha, lakshmi=\r\n, sri suktham, lakshmi japam, Vishnu sahasra namam and listen to Rudram reg=\r\nularily.\nReciting stotras with open eyes instead of closed eyes: Yes, i do =\r\nthe same as closed eyes make me suffer more.\nChandi kavacha: No, i am not r=\r\neciting this.

Kindly do not judge me based on my co=\r\nndition, rather give me some positive solution and perspective to what I am=\r\n going through.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I am a very strong beloved of god and a very strong =\r\ndevotee. I love to worship him as much as I can.however, all my passion, in=\r\nterest seems to get drained and discouraged due to my mindset and the hell =\r\nI go through because of it. I always , always get negative &amp; abusive th=\r\noughts and tie those to the god. For ex, if I hear a foul language, see a n=\r\negative thing, bad or foul my mind relates or ties it to god. My mind start=\r\n abusing god with the same foul language.&lt;br&gt;When I do &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv77893=\r\n4148misspell-13&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv778934148mark&quot;&gt;Japam&lt;/span&gt;, &nbsp;my mind wou=\r\nld not get concentration, but goes into this evil mode with racing thoughts=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;I can&#39;t see directly into the eyes of god with the fear of my mind abu=\r\nsing him I can&#39;t focus my &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv778934148misspell-14&quot;\n class=3D&quot;yi=\r\nv778934148mark&quot;&gt;drishti&lt;/span&gt; on god statues. My thoughts are extremely\n f=\r\noul...most specially foul language. However, I battle my thoughts with my w=\r\norship, which means I don&#39;t give up praying him. I requested him several ti=\r\nmes to relive me from such pain so that I can increase my devotion and pray=\r\ners. I love him. I want to pray him.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Currently, my mind and it&#39;s r=\r\nacing evil &amp; foul thoughts have become a road block in my devotion and =\r\ntrying to keep me away from him as much as possible. At one point of time, =\r\nthey dominated me and I had to stay away from praying him for a while.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Now my questions are&lt;br&gt;Am I a &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv778934148misspell-15&quot; clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;yiv778934148mark&quot;&gt;Maha&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv778934148misspell-16&quot; cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;yiv778934148mark&quot;&gt;papi&lt;/span&gt; or &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv778934148misspell-17&quot;=\r\n class=3D&quot;yiv778934148mark&quot;&gt;ghora&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv778934148misspell-1=\r\n8&quot; class=3D&quot;yiv778934148mark&quot;&gt;papi&lt;/span&gt; that this is happening to me?&lt;br&gt;=\r\nWhy does it happen to me?&lt;br&gt;Is it some kind of disorder&lt;br&gt;Am in incurring=\r\n wrath\n of god&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I am scared to death that I am accumulating the gre=\r\natest sin enough for some 100 births&lt;br&gt;What\n can I do to get out of this p=\r\nerversion and be able to concentrate on him&lt;br&gt;I want to worship god like e=\r\nvery one does&lt;br&gt;I am highly stressed because of this constant battle.
