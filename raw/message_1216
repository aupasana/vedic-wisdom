It symbolizes \n&gt; &gt; absorbing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n digesting experiences. As you make offerings in fire and \n&gt; they \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nburn in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fire, various spiritual experiences are processed and \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; digested \n&gt; &gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your internal fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; Tongue is that which allows one to taste things that \none \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; going\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to accept inside and digest.

When your mind is well-focused and \nblissful, \n&gt; &gt; the \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; fire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will automatically burn bright.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; The state of your mind will decide how you will taste \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spi=\r\nritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experiences you are going to absorb from around you. \nTh=\r\nat \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; turn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decides which tongues (tasting agents) of =\r\nyour internal \n&gt; fire \n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; receiving food right now.
