A common person gives =C2 a damn to the con=\r\ncept of liberation. When ever i =C2 have discussion with people in my offic=\r\ne they think =C2 i am mad . How should one deal with that because i =C2 thi=\r\nnk that people =C2 who are unaware of this great concept should be taught w=\r\nith this ideaology.&gt;&gt;\n\nThis cannot be forced, this should not be forced. Ye=\r\ns there are plenty of people who have no interest in these, so let them be.=\r\n Someone likes spirituality, someone else likes something, someone else lik=\r\nes another thing, its all fine. That is how it should be. I used to suffer =\r\nfrom this compulsive habit of trying to force spiritual discussions on othe=\r\nrs, now thankfully I am relatively cured. On our part, what we can do is no=\r\nt to fall in the trap of thinking that because we are doing some sadhana, o=\r\nr have some interest in these things therefore we are anyway better. Not at=\r\n all. There is beauty in diversity. I have seen rank atheists who have more=\r\n detachment and equanimity than many believers. If you want to discuss spir=\r\nituality, find a group of friends with similar inclination and do so. But n=\r\never try to force it on an unwilling individual. Whenever force is applied,=\r\n it invariable leads to a unpredictable and at times unpleasant reaction at=\r\n some later date. \n\nOne of the people whom I consider as one of my gurus, h=\r\nad told me once, &quot;Duniya banane wala duniya chalana bhi janta hai&quot; (One who=\r\n made the world also knows how to run the world). Now I believe that statem=\r\nent is bang on. Feel no pressure. Everything is in safe hands!\n\n&lt;&lt; 5. Why =\r\n=C2 did Gautam Buddha left his wife and his child and even then achieved th=\r\ne status of God?&gt;&gt;\n\nIn my view, we use the term God too loosely. There are =\r\nMahatmas, great Mahatmas, fantastic spiritual beings, and then there is God=\r\n. Buddha was a fantastic and super-duper spiritual being.\n\nNow coming to yo=\r\nur question, there is no fixed rule of how and what can lead a man to liber=\r\nation or higher states of spirituality. Frankly, there is no path which *gu=\r\narantees* liberation. All paths have the potential, but realization is an i=\r\nndividual&#39;s journey, and each such journey will not be a mirror of anyone e=\r\nlse&#39;s journey. Broadly there may be similarities, but nuances will differ. =\r\nFor some it is necessary to leave their wife and children to be spiritual, =\r\nfor others they may not need to do so. \n\nInfact, the aim of sadhana is to p=\r\nrepare yourself. If and when you experience and realize God, it is going be=\r\n God&#39;s sweet will. Sadhana does not guarantee realization, but without sadh=\r\nana it is nearly impossibly, for you are simply not prepared enough to expe=\r\nrience. \n\n&lt;&lt;3. I was reading =C2 a newspaper that people after having darsh=\r\nan of Mata Vaishno Devi, Kedarnaath, etc =C2 , while returning, met with ac=\r\ncident and died. Why does this happen? People have just come from a such a =\r\nwonderful darshan then why tragedy strikes them.&gt;&gt; \n\nThe idea of trying to =\r\nforce a cause effect relation to everything is an inherent tendency of the =\r\nmind. It is not necessarily how things are. Neither is it useful.\n\nIf a man=\r\n wants to only experience God, then every life-experience, apparently good =\r\nor apparently bad, is only going to take your forward towards the goal if y=\r\nou keep your aim fixed. No wonder Lord Krishna stresses so much on detachme=\r\nnt and equanimity in his advice to Arjuna, rather than trying to find out c=\r\nause-effect relationships of the apparently good or the apparently bad kind=\r\ns. \n\nSufferings are a great way of focusing on God. Really. Slowly but sure=\r\nly you realize that the world will run in its own pattern and you cannot do=\r\n much about it, except control what is in your power to control, that is yo=\r\nur internal state. \n\nKrishna gives this advice to Arjuna in the Second Chap=\r\nter: &quot;Dukhesva Anudhvigna-manah Sukhesu-Vigatasprhah Vita-Raga-Bhaya-Krodha=\r\nh Sthita-Dhira Munir Uchyate&quot; Gita 2:56 [Miseries do not agitate the mind, =\r\nin sukha (fleeting happiness) there is no elation, such a one who is free f=\r\nrom attachment, fear and anger, is a sage of steady mind.]\n\nTough? Sure. Bu=\r\nt no harm in making an effort. This is something to be tried on a regular b=\r\nasis, day in and day out.\n\n&lt;&lt;2. Persons who do nothing =C2 in the field of =\r\nspirituality can also meet God, higher saints. How is it possible?&gt;&gt;\n\nDepen=\r\nds on what we understand by the term spirituality. Many have this notion th=\r\nat spirituality only means sitting and doing tough penances ETC. There is m=\r\nore to spirituality than that. Essentially, it is a transformation of mind,=\r\n emotions and body (this bit is nearly impossible) into another state. \n\nSa=\r\ndhana is needed to prepare the ground - mind/emotions/body. But *meeting Go=\r\nd* (as you put it) depends on what you mean by God, and on God&#39;s sweet will=\r\n. Sometimes, living your daily life with an internal sense of surrender to =\r\na Supreme, trying to inculcate equanimity in testing circumstances, trying =\r\nto stop the mind from automatically reacting to provocations, seeing other =\r\npeople&#39;s point of views and thus becoming more objective, trying to be comp=\r\nassionate (but not self-pity or pity in any form, for pity is a degenerativ=\r\ne emotion, while compassion is uplifting) ETC are all sadhanas which can be=\r\n done by anybody. One need not read complex scriptures, or believe in relig=\r\nion to be able to do these. \n\n&lt;&lt;1. After effect of Homam can be negative al=\r\nso. Is it true?&gt;&gt;\n\nAfter effect of any sadhana can be negative (or positive=\r\n), if your aim is anything materialistic. If your aim is purely spiritual t=\r\nransformation, both so called negative and so called positive will help you=\r\n. \n\n&lt;&lt;Fulfilling the duties of husband is a blockage in the spiritual path.=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n\nDharma is never a blockage. When the time is ripe, the Lord sets the pa=\r\nth. \n\nWhen Lord Krishna send Uddhava - who was a gyani of the first order -=\r\n to the Gopis, he was amazed to see that the Gopis would spend the whole da=\r\ny doing whatever they must do, but they would perform every action, even th=\r\ne most mundane like clearing the garbage, with a small prayer in their lips=\r\n, &quot;Sri KrishNaaya Samarpayami..&quot;. \n\nPatience and surrender to God can be in=\r\nculcated, progressively, in any life situation. Infact, it is the ONLY thin=\r\ng that you can work on. Rest, the world around apart from you, will follow =\r\nits own rhythm which has been decided by actions performed in the past whic=\r\nh one may or maynot be aware of. \n\nEvery blockage is an opportunity to incr=\r\nease the sense of surrender to something Higher, and that in turn acts as a=\r\n powerful internal catalyst for change.\n\nCaveat: These answers are based on=\r\n my current perspective of things. They may not be sacrosanct. In future, I=\r\n myself may or may-not agree to these answers -:)\n\n-Regards\n Rajarshi\n--- I=\r\nn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, gaurav tripathi &lt;gaurav_alld@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Dear All Learned members,\n&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0Following are my questions:\n&gt; 1.=\r\n After effect of Homam can be negative also.
