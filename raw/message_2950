The swara (intonation) is quite good except for &quot;dheemahi&quot;, where pitch variation has been falsely introduced (whole word should be with the same pitch without ups/downs/stresses).\n \nAnother problem is that some syllables are pronounced slowly and some syllables are pronounced fast. The speed variation is incorrect.\n \nExcept for these three problems, it is good.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- samhhp_g &lt;hari.sarma@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Narasimha garu,\n&gt; \n&gt;    Can you please let us know if the below link is anywhere near to the\n&gt; correct pronunciation (from perspective of Akshara, Maatra and Swara) of\n&gt; the Gayatri Mantra?\n&gt; \n&gt;     http://wahiduddin.net/mantra/audio/gayatri_sree_once_e.mp3\n&gt; &lt;http://wahiduddin.net/mantra/audio/gayatri_sree_once_e.mp3&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks,\n&gt; \n&gt; Hari Sarma.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I cannot point to any audio that I found satisfactory.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Please buy the book &quot;Mantrapushpam&quot; by Ramakrishna Mutt. It gives\n&gt; Gayatri\n&gt; &gt; mantra with intonation marked correctly. It has many other veda\n&gt; mantras too.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I will point out a few standard mistakes I have seen people make:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (1) People normally pronounce anudattas and svaritas (letters with\n&gt; lines\n&gt; &gt; below or above) correctly, but mess up when a few udattas come in a\n&gt; row. For\n&gt; &gt; example, all the three letters in &quot;dheemahi&quot; are without any lines\n&gt; below or\n&gt; &gt; above. They have to be pronounced in the same pitch. People end up\n&gt; &gt; introducing some pitch variation and mispronouncing them. In veda\n&gt; mantras,\n&gt; &gt; pronouncing all udattas in the same pitch is the most important thing.\n&gt; Do\n&gt; &gt; not stress any letter or take the pitch up/down when pronouncing a\n&gt; string of\n&gt; &gt; udattas.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (2) The last syllable of &quot;prachodayaat&quot; is &quot;yaat&quot;. It is supposed to\n&gt; be one\n&gt; &gt; syllable. When you pronounce it correctly, &quot;t&quot; is hardly audible. If\n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; artificially add an vowel at the end of it and make it\n&gt; &quot;prachodayaatu&quot;, you\n&gt; &gt; will end up introducing an extra syllable (&quot;tu&quot;) and mess up\n&gt; everything. A\n&gt; &gt; lot of people do not pronounce &quot;t&quot; correctly. Probably some guru\n&gt; sometime\n&gt; &gt; back started the practice of adding a brief vowel at the end of words\n&gt; ending\n&gt; &gt; in a consonant, so that his sishyas could listen clearly what\n&gt; consonant he\n&gt; &gt; was saying. Unfortunately, it became a standard practice. This is good\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; teaching, but wrong for sadhana. If a word ends in a consonant, end it\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; a consonant (which cannot be heard clearly unless one tried hard) and\n&gt; do NOT\n&gt; &gt; add a brief vowel after that consonant.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; (3) Take &quot;dhiyo yo naH&quot;. The &quot;H&quot; in &quot;naH&quot; is a visarga (written in\n&gt; Sanskrit\n&gt; &gt; as &quot;:&quot; and notated in itrans as &quot;H&quot;). Visarga means &quot;letting go&quot;. You\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; supposed to let air go from you lungs in a quick exhalation.\n&gt; Pronunciation\n&gt; &gt; of &quot;naH&quot; is very close to &quot;nah&quot; though slightly different. Again, this\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; supposed to be one syllable. A lot of people, especially south\n&gt; Indians, make\n&gt; &gt; it &quot;naha&quot;. Due to extra vowel added (a), an extra syllable (ha) is\n&gt; added to\n&gt; &gt; the mantra and that messes up everything. Again this is wrong.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In this style of mispronouncing visarga, the same symbol &quot;H&quot; is\n&gt; pronounced\n&gt; &gt; differently in &quot;raamaH&quot;, &quot;hariH&quot; and &quot;guruH&quot;. The same symbol\n&gt; &gt; &quot;H&quot; or &quot;:&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; in the 3 words,\n&gt; respectively\n&gt; &gt; (i.e. raamaha, harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If you pronounce it as\n&gt; &gt; letting air go, without adding any vowel, it sounds identical in the 3\n&gt; &gt; words.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Watch out for these 3 common mistakes.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, as I keep saying, the pronunciation is only a small\n&gt; percentage of\n&gt; &gt; it. Creating the right mental images and the perfect mental focus is\n&gt; more\n&gt; &gt; important. If you lose awareness of your body, successfully shut down\n&gt; all\n&gt; &gt; other thoughts in the mind and achieve a perfect mental focus on any\n&gt; veda\n&gt; &gt; mantra with correct pronunciation, it will be a fantastic experience.\n&gt; Please\n&gt; &gt; note that correct pronunciation is not difficult to achieve, but the\n&gt; other\n&gt; &gt; things I mentioned here are not that easy!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;sbm_sharma&quot; sbm_sharma@...\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 24, 2009 8:57 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Proper Gayatri Mantra Pronunciation and\n&gt; Intonation -\n&gt; &gt; Audio Source\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Could you point me towards any easily obtainable audio recording of\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Gayatri mantra which you deem to be correctly executed?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, would you mind typing it out here, phonetically?
