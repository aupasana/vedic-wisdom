Good/bad/mixed feeling out of those results depends upon my me=\r\nntal conditioning, My mental state. hence If i need to have certain kind of=\r\n results, i have to involve in certain kind of actions and avoid certain ki=\r\nnd of actions. It is now up to me as to what I desire. even if i know i sti=\r\nll get engaged to undesirable actions due to my vasanas and i would get res=\r\nults which i do not prefer. BUT i am now prepared and accept everything wit=\r\nhout much drama. as I know deep within that It is all results of my Karma a=\r\nlone. wonderful! gives me a great clarity, level of accptance and i may say=\r\n, good detachment.\n\nThis is an over-simplified conclusions but clutter-free=\r\n as far as i go and it has given me clearer mindset. Better than heaviness =\r\ngenerated by thinking of what is Papa (and associated guilts) and Punya (an=\r\nd association of dangerous pride).

An online searcheable version of the rig=\r\n veda &\n&gt; krishna yajur veda is available from http://sanskritweb.net. If y=\r\nou\n&gt; search the taittiriya brahmana, you will find references to puNya and\n=\r\n&gt; pApa.\n&gt; \n&gt; In general, saying that &quot;xyz&quot; is not found in the vedas is not=\r\n\n&gt; something to be taken lightly. Just a small fraction of the various\n&gt; br=\r\nanches of veda are available to us today. So, the best that we can\n&gt; say is=\r\n that some subject doesn&#39;t appear (in a literal sense) in the\n&gt; fraction of=\r\n vedic texts that we have not yet lost. And we can only say\n&gt; that after an=\r\n exhaustive search.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; it is better to look the whole thing as law o=\r\nf Karma\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I agree.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, when we are caught in the pains of s=\r\nuffering, this is very\n&gt; difficult to internalize. Instead of spending too =\r\nmuch time wondering\n&gt; about who set the building on fire, it is better to g=\r\net out of the\n&gt; burning building. Later, there will be plenty of time to po=\r\nint the\n&gt; finger at everyone else, and then, reluctantly, point the finger =\r\nback\n&gt; to choices that we freely undertook at a different time.\n&gt; \n&gt; When t=\r\nhe mind is calm, we can try to contemplate on the nature of\n&gt; karma. Then, =\r\nwe can use our new wisdom to try and keep the mind calm\n&gt; when it faces agi=\r\ntating situations. But, when the mind is already\n&gt; agitated, trying to cont=\r\nemplate on the nature of karma may not be the\n&gt; best way to calm the mind.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; sasneham,\n&gt; \n&gt;      ajit\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Mar 1, 2012 at 9:21 AM, ve=\r\ndic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If you say so, I =\r\nwould not argue much on that.
