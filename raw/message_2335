Flies were troubling hi=\r\nm\nand he was killing them.\n\nSeeing this Bhagavan told him: =93Don=92t kill =\r\nthem; it is wrong.=94 After some\ntime the boy looked at Bhagavan intensely =\r\nand remarked: =93You say killing is\nwrong. I was only killing little flies =\r\nwhich were giving me trouble, but you\nhave killed a big tiger and you are s=\r\nitting on its skin. How can it be?=94\nBhagavan laughed and said: =93Yes, wh=\r\nat he says is quite right!=94\n\nb) The same boy had the habit of wasting foo=\r\nd served on his leaf-plate while\nseated with others. Once Bhagavan told him=\r\n that he should not leave anything\non the plate when he finished eating. Th=\r\nat day too the boy could not eat\neverything, but stuffed something into his=\r\n mouth and took out the empty\nleaf.\n\nBhagavan saw him take out the empty le=\r\naf. However, the boy after throwing\naway the leaf also spat out the food th=\r\nat he had stuffed in his mouth. It\nwas reported to Bhagavan. He enjoyed the=\r\n trick of the boy and gave a hearty\nlaugh.\n\nc) Another boy who used to go r=\r\nound the Hill with Sri Bhagavan and other\ndevotees was always silent, thoug=\r\nh others used to sing hymns and prayers and\nchants. (Bhagavan sometimes eve=\r\nn used to hold this boy=92s shoulder while\nwalking round the Hill.)\n\nOne da=\r\ny Bhagavan, after everyone of the party had sung some song or other,\nasked =\r\nthis boy why he alone did not sing.The boy=92s spontaneous reply made\nSri B=\r\nhagavan laugh to his heart=92s content.

His parents were very keen to get him married and he=\r\n himself\nwas stoutly opposing it. They even approached Bhagavan to persuade=\r\n him to\nmarry.\n\nOne day, Sri Kapali Sastriar went near Bhagavan and said: =\r\n=93Bhagavan,\ntomorrow I intend taking up asrama1 (stage in life).=94 Bhagav=\r\nan, who knew his\naversion to marriage and the anxiety of his parents, was s=\r\nurprised and said\n=93Kapali, what are you saying?

I am going t=\r\no enter into the second\nasrama1 (meaning, marriage)!=94 Bhagavan laughed he=\r\nartily and enjoyed the\njoke.\n\ne) A young girl, named Rukmini, aged ten, the=\r\n daughter of Vilacheri Ranga\nIyer, used to meditate in front of Sri Bhagava=\r\nn,seated like a statue. Some\nolder boys or girls sitting next to her used t=\r\no tickle her to disturb her.\n\nBhagavan used to watch all these in amusement=\r\n.

A\nboy nearby (who had not had his bath yet)=\r\n teased her,saying: =93I am going to\ntouch you.=94 Rukmini firmly replied:\n=\r\n\n=93No one can touch me!=94 Bhagavan was looking at them. She turned to Bha=\r\ngavan\nand then asked, =93Yes, none can touch me,they can touch only my body=\r\n.
