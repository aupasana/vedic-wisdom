Some people cannot see beyond a man&#39;s name and religion and hence =\r\ncannot recognize when a great celestial being is born in a different religi=\r\non.\n\n    Swami Vimalananda, the Aghori yogi mentioned in the &quot;Aghora&quot; serie=\r\ns books, is somebody who achieved the highest states of consciousness. He r=\r\neceived a lot of knowledge directly from Mother Tara. Accordinging to him, =\r\nAkbar and Jodha were the re-incarnation of Samyukta and Rajput King Prithvi=\r\nraj Chouhan. As Prithviraj, he repelled so many Muslim invaders at the bord=\r\ner of India. When Muslims finally conquered India, he was reborn as one of =\r\nthem and put breaks on their aggression and changed their ways.\n\n    In tha=\r\nt age, Muslim invaders engaged in barbarism, destroyed temples, libraries a=\r\nnd other relics of native religion and culture. They beheaded Hindus who re=\r\nfused to convert, they raped Hindu women and they beheaded defeated kings. =\r\nThey just tried to wipe out the native religion and culture and replace wit=\r\nh theirs. Akbar slowed down the barbarism and aggression and promoted toler=\r\nance and integration. He stopped the forced conversions, rapes and beheadin=\r\ngs of Hindus. He stopped the destruction of temples and libraries. He talke=\r\nd about respecting other religions while following one&#39;s own religion. He e=\r\nven took on the mighty Muslim clerics when he abolished a special tax on Hi=\r\nndus based on religion. He was a man of great character, conviction and pri=\r\nnciples and was utterly fearless. He had affinity for Rajputs and was even =\r\nborn in a Rajput family and spent early years there. He displayed the samsk=\r\naras and instincts of a refined and cultured Rajput more than those a of Mu=\r\nghal kig - he was so unlike his grandfather Babar, father Humayun and step-=\r\nbrother Adham.\n\n    He used to offer arghyas to Sun in the morning and then=\r\n participate in a Zoroastrian fire ritual of Farsis (similar to our homam) =\r\nand then do a namaz with Muslim clerics. Such tolerance was unheard of from=\r\n any other Muslim ruler in those days (or perhaps even today!). Towards the=\r\n end of his life, he even started his own religion, which was based on his =\r\nrealization and is quite noble. He was a spiritually elevated soul. Irrespe=\r\nctive of the religion one follows, one deserves our respect and admiration =\r\nif one embodies the spirit of sanatana dharma in one&#39;s thoughts and actions=\r\n.\n\n    Akbar was a true hero - a being who came down from a higher loka to =\r\nfulfil a certain mission with the blessings of rishis. His contribution to =\r\nthe safekeeping of sanatana dharma is not to be judged from what harm his f=\r\nellow Muslims inflicted on sanatana dharma. His contribution is to be judge=\r\nd from what *more* harm to sanatana dharma he helped *avoid*. If he had not=\r\n come, I have no doubt that sanatana dharma would have suffered much much m=\r\nore than it did. That was not the wish of rishis and that is why they sent =\r\nsomebody to alter the course and minimize the harm. It is unfortunate that =\r\nthose who see the goodness of emperor Ashoka and king Shivaji cannot see th=\r\ne goodness of Akbar simply because he was a Muslim.\n\n    It is unfortunate =\r\nthat some Hindus are equating Akbar with the other cruel and barbaric Musli=\r\nm kings. Who should be (was) a friend of Hindus is being portrayed as an en=\r\nemy and being shot down. Instead, we should promote his story and inspire m=\r\nore people to be like him. He was a great inspirational figure then and sho=\r\nuld be now too.\n\n    The epic movie &quot;Jodha Albar&quot; is a very good movie abou=\r\nt one of the greatest and most dharmik emperors of India. The director and =\r\nactor did justice to a man of great character that Akbar was. I am sad abou=\r\nt the mud-slinging that some of my fellow Hindus are engaging in. Please do=\r\n not assassinate the character of Akbar.\n\n    If you want, please make movi=\r\nes of the same caliber and cinematic excellence on great Hindu heroes such =\r\nas Chatrapati Shivaji, Prithviraj Chouhan, Sri Krishnadeva Raya, Vikramarka=\r\n, Salivahana, Ashoka, Jnaaneshwar, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Shankaracharya, Ra=\r\nmakrishna Paramahamsa, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi etc. But there is no ne=\r\ned to denigrate a fine movie made on Akbar.\n\n    These are my 2 cents on th=\r\ne fire over Jodha Akbar.\n\n    Best regards,\n    Narasimha\n    -------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n    Do Ganapathi Homa=\r\nm Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n    Spirituality: http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://v=\r\nedicastro.home.comcast.net\n    Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org\n    Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJ=\r\nagannath.org\n    ----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n\n      ----- Original Message ----- \n\n      Namaskar\n\n      This i=\r\ns an awareness drive to awake people to boycott movie &#39;Jodhaa Akbar&#39;.\n\n    =\r\n  The movie Jodhaa Akbar is a vile, vicious, and covert attempt by a mischi=\r\nevous producer/director from Bollywood (Mumbai) to make quick bucks by deni=\r\ngrating and vilifying the Hindu (Rajput) people.

As Prithviraj, he repelled so many Muslim \n    invaders at the=\r\n border of India. When Muslims finally conquered India, he \n    was reborn =\r\nas one of them and put breaks on their aggression and changed \n    their wa=\r\nys.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n =\r\n   &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;In that age, Muslim invaders engaged in=\r\n \n    barbarism, destroyed temples, libraries and other relics of native re=\r\nligion \n    and culture.

He even took on the mighty \n    Muslim clerics when he abolished a =\r\nspecial tax on Hindus based on religion. \n    He was a man of great charact=\r\ner, conviction and principles and was utterly \n    fearless. He had affinit=\r\ny for Rajputs and was even born in a Rajput family \n    and spent early yea=\r\nrs there.

Such tolerance was unhear=\r\nd \n    of from any other Muslim ruler in those days (or perhaps even today!=\r\n). \n    Towards the end of his life, he even started his own religion, whic=\r\nh was \n    based on his realization and is quite noble.
