Mr. FL is under great pressure due to that.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mr. =\r\nFL can have many options to react in the situations:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1] Thinking co=\r\nnstantly and repenting for the act He can-\n&gt; &gt; Curse, Constantly follow-up,=\r\n Mount Abuses, Remain under stress, resort to\n&gt; other techniques of &#39;Vasuli=\r\n&#39; and resorts to many Internal and external\n&gt; activities concerning that is=\r\nsue.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In this case, He strongly identifies with the Money, act of Gi=\r\nving then\n&gt; expecting it back, Repenting etc...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; OR\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2] Mr. F=\r\nL can really grab the golden chance to resort to the\n&gt; implementation of kn=\r\nowledge (KIP-Knowledge in Practice) and thinks that it\n&gt; was a Rina which n=\r\needed to be paid back and practically starts training the\n&gt; mind with that =\r\nknowledge. He follows up for the money but with the attitude\n&gt; of detachmen=\r\nt. Although he shows to his family and friends that he is\n&gt; extremely conce=\r\nrned and it was foolish act etc... But in his mind he thinks\n&gt; that it was =\r\na rina from some past life which was fulfilled. He thinks that\n&gt; they were =\r\nMoney of Mother and she will take care. If they needed to come\n&gt; back, she =\r\nwill do it or if they were to be paid to nullify some past rinas\n&gt; then the=\r\ny will not come back.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; With the Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL wil=\r\nl not Create New Rinas and\n&gt; will be able to break free from this particula=\r\nr chain.

One aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa.\n&gt; One =\r\naspect of the Mother makes you experience good and bad in that Maayaa.\n&gt; On=\r\ne aspect of the Mother makes you understand Maayaa to overcome it. One\n&gt; as=\r\npect of the Mother makes you fight and overcome it. When one realizes Self\n=\r\n&gt; at the end, irrespective of the path taken, one finally sees that all the=\r\nse\n&gt; are aspects of a Single Mother who is also essentially true Self.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I have started to read the Aghora series books by Dr=\r\n. Robert\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings on the subjec=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I need to read more!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aghora series books=\r\n by Svoboda are good, but Aghora is not everyone&#39;s\n&gt; cup of tea. It is norm=\r\nal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora mea=\r\nns &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names of\n&gt; Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C2 Ag=\r\nhora (aghori) does not see anything as\n&gt; terrible or bad or impure and sees=\r\n all as impermanent manifestations of god\n&gt; and tries to focus the thinking=\r\n of the mind on what is permanent (god)\n&gt; always, instead of impermanent ma=\r\nnifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When someone dies, north Indians chant=\r\n &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while\n&gt; carrying the dead body to the funeral. It m=\r\neans &quot;only the name of Lord Rama\n&gt; is true and everything else is an illusi=\r\non&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself\n&gt; that life and death are just a tempora=\r\nry illusion and only the Lord is real.\n&gt; But the question is: why should we=\r\n remind ourselves of this ultimate truth\n&gt; only when someone dies? When som=\r\neone praises us for a supposedly great thing\n&gt; we have done and we are abou=\r\nt to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell\n&gt; ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai.=\r\n This thing we did and the praises are\n&gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord=\r\n is real. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel at=\r\ntracted to something beautiful and want\n&gt; to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselve=\r\ns &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that\n&gt; seems beautiful and other things=\r\n that seem not so beautiful are temporary\n&gt; illusions. Only the Lord is rea=\r\nl. Let the mind not dwell on temporary\n&gt; illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When someone att=\r\nacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or\n&gt; angry, can&#39;t we tell o=\r\nurselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are\n&gt; temporary illusions. Onl=\r\ny the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. His =\r\nmind\n&gt; rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelli=\r\nng* on\n&gt; them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and =\r\nthinking\n&gt; about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focu=\r\ns on what is\n&gt; permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2=\r\n =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; V=\r\nedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An\n&gt; agh=\r\nora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant\n&gt; illus=\r\nions and the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he\n&gt; questions=\r\n why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where\n&gt; feces i=\r\ns eaten.=C2 But, please remember that eating feces is not the main\n&gt; point.=\r\n Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an\n&gt; imperma=\r\nnent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For\n&gt; exa=\r\nmple, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s\n&gt; mi=\r\nnd is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while\n&gt; e=\r\nating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be=\r\n\n&gt; dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties a=\r\nnd\n&gt; will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self=\r\n and\n&gt; he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, a vedantin also has th=\r\ne same notions really. He chants vedic\n&gt; verses when eating food, which ess=\r\nentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am\n&gt; consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such cha=\r\nnting may merely be a ritual and not\n&gt; be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking.=\r\n As he eats, his mind may dwell on the\n&gt; impermanant manifestations of Self=\r\n (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal\n&gt; curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracke=\r\nr&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the\n&gt; permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth\n&gt; and=\r\n trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. But aghora\n&gt; i=\r\ns putting himself in an extreme situation where failure results in a very\n&gt;=\r\n bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing one =\r\nto\n&gt; transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse th=\r\nat\n&gt; says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and nic=\r\nely\n&gt; made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while =\r\neating\n&gt; is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nic=\r\ne) taste\n&gt; of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other han=\r\nd, if the\n&gt; mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, =\r\nit will be so\n&gt; disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very b=\r\nad dual\n&gt; experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by ev=\r\neryone\n&gt; merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhana=\r\ns\n&gt; succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose=\r\n someone is doing a lot of sadhana,\n&gt; like japam and homam, and yet having =\r\na weakness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind\n&gt; is dwelling on sex or getting sexu=\r\nal thoughts in the middle of sadhana and\n&gt; that is causing guilt and blocki=\r\nng one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce celi=\r\nbacy and keep the mind away\n&gt; from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formu=\r\nla for overcoming such\n&gt; thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come =\r\nand distract one. Even if\n&gt; one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no gu=\r\narantee that the fascination\n&gt; in the mind does not return to bite one afte=\r\nr that. But, how to overcome the\n&gt; fascination some minds may have for sex?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix t=\r\nhe root cause\n&gt; and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sa=\r\ndhana and sex as\n&gt; two different activities (one pure and the other impure)=\r\n, he may combine\n&gt; them into one without such distinctions of pure vs impur=\r\ne. Suppose an aghora\n&gt; sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap=\r\n and then does his\n&gt; japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result=\r\n in sex. He may think\n&gt; that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose=\r\n he persists to do japam\n&gt; like that for several months/years. Eventually, =\r\nmind may be reprogrammed. He\n&gt; may no longer feel that he is doing somethin=\r\ng impure. He may no longer feel\n&gt; titillation. The association in his mind =\r\nbetween nakedness and sex may be\n&gt; broken down. Seeing naked pictures physi=\r\ncally or mentally may no longer\n&gt; evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts=\r\n of meditation. Any small thoughts\n&gt; related to sex that suddenly rise in t=\r\nhe head may not lead to denser and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; denser thoughts relating to sex an=\r\nd distraction in sadhana, but they\n&gt; may now take the mind back to meditati=\r\non. After spending so much time in\n&gt; meditation while sitting naked intimat=\r\nely, the attraction and thrill mind\n&gt; may feel for nakedness or intimacy ma=\r\ny be broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s\n&gt; fascination and weakness for sex =\r\nmay be gone largely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of conditioning based o=\r\nn prior experiences and the\n&gt; thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes =\r\ntries to break down some of\n&gt; these structures by engaging in certain pract=\r\nices that undermine those\n&gt; structures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, is this a =\r\nfool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible\n&gt; that the person keeps =\r\non engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks\n&gt; of sex everytime he=\r\n sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation\n&gt; everytime he sees=\r\n naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to\n&gt; start with.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses=\r\n head on\n&gt; and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal pers=\r\non may push\n&gt; the problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low s=\r\ntakes. Such a\n&gt; risky strategy is not applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and what is\n&gt; Aghora&quot;=\r\n? Aghora is merely a practical way to understand and absorb Vedanta\n&gt; in on=\r\ne&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan. However, it\n&gt; is=\r\n certainly not suitable for all and many may feel aversion. More\n&gt; dangerou=\r\nsly, some people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong\n&gt; understandin=\r\ng and the thrill such an understanding brings.=C2 Aghora stands\n&gt; for neith=\r\ner thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract some people\n&gt; pursuing t=\r\nhrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and\n&gt; Vedanta/Upanisha=\r\nds are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one\n&gt; absorbs the trut=\r\nh into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BT=\r\nW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual\n&gt; paths an=\r\nd explains the basic reality.

Now it happened s=\r\no that Mr. VS could not repay it due to reasons only known to him. Mr. VS g=\r\nives many excuses and many dates but fails and ultimately does not pay back=\r\n. Mr. FL is under great pressure due to that.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Mr. FL can =\r\nhave many options to react in the situations:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 1] Thinking =\r\nconstantly and repenting for the act He can-&lt;br&gt;&gt; Curse, Constantly foll=\r\now-up, Mount Abuses, Remain under stress, resort to other techniques of &#3=\r\n9;Vasuli&#39; and resorts to many Internal and external activities concerni=\r\nng that issue.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; In this case, He strongly identifies with =\r\nthe Money, act of Giving then expecting it back, Repenting etc...&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; OR&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 2] Mr. FL can really grab the golden chance to =\r\nresort to the implementation of knowledge (KIP-Knowledge in Practice) and t=\r\nhinks that it was a Rina which needed to be paid back and practically start=\r\ns training the mind with that knowledge. He follows up for the money but wi=\r\nth the attitude of detachment. Although he shows to his family and friends =\r\nthat he is extremely concerned and it was foolish act etc... But in his min=\r\nd he thinks that it was a rina from some past life which was fulfilled. He =\r\nthinks that they were Money of Mother and she will take care. If they neede=\r\nd to come back, she will do it or if they were to be paid to nullify some p=\r\nast rinas then they will not come back.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; With the Second A=\r\npproach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas and will be able to brea=\r\nk free from this particular chain. He may have successfully PAID BACK his d=\r\nebt.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; With the first Approach, Mr. FL has identified himsel=\r\nf very strongly with Money and its ownership and hence all the actions done=\r\n due to that, so He may have created NEW RINAS which will be needed to sett=\r\nled on a later date.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; However I am not sure for what I hav=\r\ne written.

When someone praises us for a supposedly great thing we have done and w=\r\ne are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raam=\r\na naam satya hai.

When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want to get it, can&#3=\r\n9;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems bea=\r\nutiful and other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary illusions.=\r\n Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;=\r\n?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; When someone attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel=\r\n sad or angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. Thes=\r\ne abuses are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not d=\r\nwell on temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nA true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. Hi=\r\ns mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelli=\r\nng* on them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and th=\r\ninking about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on=\r\n what is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot=\r\n;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursu=\r\nes it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant illusions and th=\r\ne only permanent reality within them is the Self, he questions why he can e=\r\nat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces is eaten.=C2=A0B=\r\nut, please remember that eating feces is not the main point. Perceiving Sel=\r\nf in the food being consumed and not perceiving an impermanent manifestatio=\r\nn of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For example, eating feces =\r\nwith disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s mind is dwelling on=\r\n the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it.=\r\n A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling=\r\n on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties an=\r\nd will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self an=\r\nd he is eating Self.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a vedanti=\r\nn also has the same notions really. He chants vedic verses when eating food=\r\n, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nev=\r\nertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed i=\r\nn one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant man=\r\nifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinja=\r\nl curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the f=\r\nocus on the permanent (Self).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a ved=\r\nantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth and trying to abs=\r\norb that truth into every thought and impulse. But aghora is putting himsel=\r\nf in an extreme situation where failure results in a very bad dual experien=\r\nce. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing one to transcend duali=\r\nty! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse that says &quot;I am S=\r\nelf and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and nicely made foo=\r\nd, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while eating is not =\r\ntoo bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a la=\r\nddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the mind fai=\r\nls to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so disgus=\r\nting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual experience may=\r\n act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by everyone =\r\nmerely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas succeed=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Take another simple example. Suppose someone is doi=\r\nng a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for se=\r\nx. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in =\r\nthe middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadh=\r\nana.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce=\r\n celibacy and keep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a fo=\r\nrmula for overcoming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come=\r\n and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no gua=\r\nrantee that the fascination in the mind does not return to bite one after t=\r\nhat. But, how to overcome the fascination some minds may have for sex?&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will=\r\n try to fix the root cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of=\r\n keeping sadhana and sex as two different activities (one pure and the othe=\r\nr impure), he may combine them into one without such distinctions of pure v=\r\ns impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on hi=\r\ns lap and then does his japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and res=\r\nult in sex. He may think that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppos=\r\ne he persists to do japam like that for several months/years. Eventually, m=\r\nind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something i=\r\nmpure. He may no longer feel titillation. The association in his mind betwe=\r\nen nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically o=\r\nr mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of medit=\r\nation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may=\r\n not lead to denser and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; denser thoughts relating to sex and d=\r\nistraction in sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to meditation. A=\r\nfter spending so much time in meditation while sitting naked intimately, th=\r\ne attraction and thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be brok=\r\nen down. Overall, the person&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may be =\r\ngone largely.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of condition=\r\ning based on prior experiences and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora s=\r\nometimes tries to break down some of these structures by engaging in certai=\r\nn practices that undermine those structures.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible t=\r\nhat the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks =\r\nof sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation =\r\neverytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to =\r\nstart with.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2=A0Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and weakne=\r\nsses head on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal pe=\r\nrson may push the problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low s=\r\ntakes. Such a risky strategy is not applicable to all.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2=A0Like Manish=\r\n said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Ag=\r\nhora is merely a practical way to understand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;=\r\ns thought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan. However, it is cer=\r\ntainly not suitable for all and many may feel aversion. More dangerously, s=\r\nome people may feel attraction for it based on a wrong understanding and th=\r\ne thrill such an understanding brings.=C2=A0Aghora stands for neither thril=\r\nls nor perversion, though it *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and=\r\n/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the s=\r\name, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the truth into one&#39=\r\n;s thinking by making failure very unpleasant.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual pa=\r\nths and explains the basic reality.

H=\r\nis Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis=C2=A0mention=C2=A0great details about all th=\r\ne=C2=A0nine avaranas and different forms of the divine mother as one goes t=\r\nhrough each avarana.=C2=A0In the Dhyana Krithi=C2=A0of those, in the very=\r\n=C2=A0first line he says, &#39;Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39=\r\n;.=C2=A0That line tells me that=C2=A0even through Sri Vidya one can worship=\r\n Chandi Ma, in that form.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; So my que=\r\nstion was in that perspective. Anyway, your reply was a great one in which =\r\nyou mentioned how the Self is surrounded by layers of duality! I never thou=\r\nght in those terms. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have started readi=\r\nng Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it fluently, before I =\r\nstart to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during navaratri of 2010.

Its purpose, too, is to unravel the layer=\r\n of duality and realize Self.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Lalita means gent=\r\nle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teaches yo=\r\nu gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern and stri=\r\nct, you will learn fast (provided you can face the strictness).
