However, you are free to address me as you feel like=\r\n and I&#39;ll happily accept it hence forth.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just came across Vimalanand=\r\na&#39; s thought on Karma. He says (and Narasimha has many a times repeated) th=\r\nat Karma is only generated (Binding to one) when one self-identifies with i=\r\nt.\n&gt; Although, it may seem easy to understand intellectually, the state is =\r\nmultiple times difficult to achieve. Nevertheless, it&#39;s an extremely import=\r\nant statement to answer our queries.\n&gt; \n&gt; Important information about Vimal=\r\nananda which I came to know only yesterday is that he was a big time smoker=\r\n and there was not a single day passed in his life when he didn&#39;t do smokin=\r\ng except on the final day of his departure from physical body. He used to a=\r\ns well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently and occasionally ate meat. I gave this inf=\r\normation, because as you pointed out (and I also agree) that it is an inter=\r\nesting coincidence of exact thoughts crossing our minds. Further, please al=\r\nso note an important thing. The Aghori used to say very frequently to all h=\r\nis audience to do what he says and not try to do what he does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now wha=\r\ntever I wrote above seems sufficient to answer the questions you asked. Let=\r\n me put in my thoughts further (Mind you, these are thoughts of an unrealiz=\r\ned person and the worth can be next to nothing). When we take example cases=\r\n of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda or Sainbaba or any other such acknowle=\r\ndged spiritual giants, we tend to forget that they are all realized souls w=\r\nho achieved very high level of spiritual realization. They are knower of ev=\r\nerything or many things in the universe. Their individual ego is perfectly =\r\nand completely tuned to universal ego. In short they *know* what they are d=\r\noing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;. Relevant to our topic of discussion, I w=\r\nould say that if they ate meat or smoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed ani=\r\nmals, they actually knew what they are doing. There would be surely a speci=\r\nfic purpose behind each and every action of theirs because as I said, they =\r\nknow complete background behind their each action and\n&gt;  moreover their sel=\r\nf identification is missing from the action and hence it is like Nature ope=\r\nrates through them to accomplish a special purpose without binding them in =\r\nany cause-effect chain.\n&gt; Ramakrishna used to frequently say to all his dis=\r\nciples that Naren is very different from others. He has a blazing spiritual=\r\n fire burning within him which can consume anything and everything. A food =\r\nrestriction does not bind him. He can eat anything without getting spiritua=\r\nlly troubled but for others, a kind of food intake is extremely important.\n=\r\n&gt; If Vivekananda ate meat during his stay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some s=\r\nubtle purpose which is not possible for majority of us to comprehend unless=\r\n explained by a person of that level. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from the=\r\n sincere seekers amongst westerners so that he can be accepted by them as o=\r\nne of them and then slowly try to eradicate their habits of meat eating and=\r\n such other undesirable habits. It is also possible at the same time that h=\r\ne is nullifying some balanced Rinanubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he =\r\nate. It is also possible that he would have showered his unseen blessings o=\r\nn the animal&#39;s soul by consuming its meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no=\r\n apparent reasons for that but just a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll no=\r\nt know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivek=\r\nananda saved a boy from drowning in a lake in USA while he was still in Ind=\r\nia and did not even planned to go to USA. When the boy, after some\n&gt;  years=\r\n actually met Swami in USA for the first time, swami immediately told him t=\r\no stay away from water and when he requested swami to accept him as his dis=\r\nciple, swami, after a moments thought told him that he is not his guru and =\r\nhis guru will come later and will give him Silver Cup as a gift. That man l=\r\nater became disciple of Paramhansa Yogananda and after 40 years, he was act=\r\nually given a gift of Silver-cup by Yogananda which literally fulfilled wha=\r\nt swami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before 40 years.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Vivekananda was all =\r\nknowing and most of us are NOT.\n&gt; \n&gt; So moral of my whole writings is that =\r\nit&#39;s unwise as well as self deluding to take excuses of the unconventional =\r\nhabits of Swami Vivekananda, Shirdi Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj=\r\n, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami and such masters and justify our completely=\r\n self identified and utterly selfish cruel/unjust actions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth &lt;k=\r\nritels@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Grea=\r\nt coincidence of thoughts!!=C3=82=C2=A0I was about to ask this question tod=\r\nay on Non-Veg eating.=C3=82=C2=A0 It is clear from the below passage meat e=\r\nating is not advisable for anyone.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I was=C3=82=C2=A0reading=\r\n a book on Swami Vivekananda (Naa Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrot=\r\ne that he survived many days on just eating meat when he was living in USA =\r\nalso relished it.

That is why you find a meat-eater reborn either as a predator or=\r\n prey or as both in succession. Human beings cry a lot at funerals of their=\r\n own kind but they have absolutely no thought for the sufferings of the ani=\r\nmals they slaughter. They never hesitate to kill and eat. Just think, first=\r\n they kill the chicken. Often they will cut its throat and let it bleed to =\r\ndeath, which is a most painful way to die. Then it will be cleaned, cooked =\r\nand eaten, and if it happens to be tough everyone will curse it for not sat=\r\nisfying their palates. How many humans would give beautiful tender lean mea=\r\nt if they were slaughtered, dressed, prepared and served?\n&gt; &gt; Meat-eaters c=\r\nonveniently forget that animal mothers too love their children. Do they eve=\r\nr think of the agony a hen goes through when her chicks are slain in front =\r\nof her eyes? or a cow, the embodiment of motherliness, do they consider how=\r\n much she suffers when she sees the slaughter of her beloved calf whom she =\r\nhas grown in her own body and nourished with her milk, whom she loves more =\r\nthan her own life?\n&gt; &gt; Do these so called humans ever think of the terrible=\r\n pain they cause to mother cow? Could they endure their own children being =\r\nmurdered before their own eyes?\n&gt; &gt; How is Ma to teach such donkeys? They a=\r\nre not humans, whose intellect is subtle enough to self-identify with anoth=\r\ner being of a different species and experience its personal joys and sorrow=\r\ns. Ma has no alternative but to make them suffer, allowing the animals they=\r\n have tortured to torture them in return. Fair&#39;s fair, after all. If I cut =\r\nyour throat in this birth you have every right to cut mine in the next or s=\r\nome succeeding birth. Experience is the best teacher and a fool will learn =\r\nfrom no other.&quot;=C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
