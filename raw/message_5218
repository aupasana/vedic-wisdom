If one worries too much about the bea=\r\nuty and technical details of the stick and ends up putting stress on the le=\r\ng, the stick does not serve its purpose. The stick is helpful only if you c=\r\nonsciously spare the leg from effort. Once the leg cures, you can then not =\r\nonly walk but also run. Similarly, a lot of technical details of the mantra=\r\n do not matter much.

How can we purify the five elements?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If there=\r\n is attachment to something which we think of as our possession, can the ea=\r\nrth element inside us be considered to be pure? If there is attachment to s=\r\nomething which we want to control, can the fire element inside us be consid=\r\nered to be pure? And so on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If we are vulnerable to the si=\r\nx internal enemies - lust, anger, greed, delusion, wantonness and jealosy -=\r\n then aren&#39;t there still impurities?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Complete surrender an=\r\nd humility that I mentioned are not some hollow virtues. They are the real =\r\nsigns of purity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Whatever mantra yo=\r\nu are given by your guru, whatever mantra you picked out of attraction, or =\r\nwhatever mantra you otherwise do, please do not think too much whether it i=\r\ns the right mantra. That is secondary. IF there is a\n mantra you use, use i=\r\nt sincerely and with devotion. Use it as a tool to increase your surrender =\r\nand devotion. At that end, THAT is what matters and brings results.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; A person with a broken leg needs to use a walking stick until the=\r\n leg cures and becomes fit. How big or heavy the stick is, what wood it is =\r\nmade of, what is the carving on it, etc, is not that important. The main pu=\r\nrpose of the stick to give complete rest to the leg and help it cure fast. =\r\nIf one worries too much about the beauty and technical details of the stick=\r\n and ends up putting stress on the leg, the stick does not serve its purpos=\r\ne. The stick is helpful only if you consciously spare the leg from effort. =\r\nOnce the leg cures, you can then not only walk but also run. Similarly, a l=\r\not of technical details of the mantra do not matter much. Use mantra to foc=\r\nus the mind and cure it of its conditioning (i.e. impurity!).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n ------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Le=\r\nssons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short =\r\nHomam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/=\r\n&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spiritua=\r\nlity: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow=\r\n target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Jyo=\r\ntish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; re=\r\nl=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;=\r\n/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=\r\n=3Dvedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank\n ymail=\r\nto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-astrology@yahoogroups=\r\n.com&lt;/A&gt;, Chandan Sabharwal &lt;chandan.sabharwal@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; then what about tantras which proclaim that unless the 5 eleme=\r\nnts are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; not purified first , every puja / ritual is simply ab=\r\nhichara ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Chandan Sabharwa=\r\nl.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.com/mc/com=\r\npose?to=3Dvedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank=\r\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-astrology@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; Namaste Ranjan-da,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nice words!

I am a strong believer t=\r\nhat prayers to the Almighty are the ultimate answers to things not in our c=\r\nontrol. Thank you for sharing this simple mantras with the readers; literal=\r\nly hundreds would benefit from this as they seek their solace. Bhakti is wh=\r\nat makes people focus more on internal strengths (of individuals) and becom=\r\ne stronger to overcome difficulties.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am student/have been a student of Astrology =\r\nfor 20+ years, and continue to use it for\n guidance for the future, but do =\r\nnot expect predictions would come true as there are factorial 12! x 9! fact=\r\norial permutations and combinations to deal with, virtually making it impos=\r\nsible to predict correctly. But for a trained eye and the learned gurus, an=\r\nd for those who have focused more on the good lord to seek the knowledge (w=\r\nith total discipline and in submitting to the Lord unconditionally), this a=\r\nrt becomes a science as they acquire &quot;vak-suddhi&quot;; AND they are able to gui=\r\nde the people. I see many in this group following such discipline and thank=\r\ns to them. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; While this wonderful help is available, I still think we need to give t=\r\nhe members something to focus on the Lord in terms of mantras like you have=\r\n done Mr. Jay-ji. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Is it possible, Jay-ji, that we have a few simple mantras listed=\r\n for the benefit of the members to\n address the common issues people face, =\r\nplus to appease the lords of the houses (like Ganesha for ketu, Durga for r=\r\nahu, Balaji for saturn etc). Mr. PVRji has listed some, but would be good t=\r\no develop such list and make them available in one place. I truly believe t=\r\nhat would be more useful and powerful than prescribing remedies which may o=\r\nr may not work(with possible high degree of error possibilities in the char=\r\nts). Bhakti and meditation always would work!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If Mr. PVR or other gurujis are readi=\r\nng this, I would appreciate it if they take the leadership to develop such =\r\nmantras and circulate for the benefit of the members.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you very much!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With deep regard=\r\ns&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Murthy Divakaruni&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.m=\r\nc560.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot;&gt;vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;jkumarkb&quot; &lt;jkumarkb@&gt; wro=\r\nte:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Dear All,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chant the below mantra at least 108 times everyday with de=\r\nep belief and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedication.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajagopal=\r\na Mantram&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Krishna Krishna Mah=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82yogin&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakt=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82n=C3=83=E2=80=9E=C3=82m Abha=\r\nyam Kara&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Govinda Param=C3=83=E2=80=9E=\r\n=C3=82nanda&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarvam Me Vasha M=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9E=C3=82na Ya\n !!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Translation:- Krishna, oh great Yogi, you give s=\r\nhelter to your devotees.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Oh Govinda, =\r\nYou are the giver of Supreme Bliss.
