Take a sankalpa for Ucchishta Ganapathi homam and =\r\nSri Lakshmi homam. Invoke Ucchishta Ganapathi in fire, do panchopachara poo=\r\nja, offer the chosen mantra of his as many times as you want and then offer=\r\n him some naivedyam/food (fruit piece or something). Then invoke Lakshmi in=\r\n the same fire, do a panchopachara pooja, offer her chosen mantra as many t=\r\nimes as you want and offer her some naivedyam/food. Then do uttarangam and =\r\npoornahuti. At the time of poornahuti, you can say the main mantras of both=\r\n devatas and offer poornaahuti.\n \nI have seen some priests actually take sa=\r\nnkalpam for only one homam and make offerings to other deities also, withou=\r\nt a formal invocation. In other words, you take sankalpam for Ganapathi onl=\r\ny and, after finishing his mantra, you simply pour ahutis in fire for Laksh=\r\nmi (or other deities). That is also fine.\n \nWhen you receive a VIP at your =\r\nhouse, you may follow a protocol (e.g. greet him at the door, walk him insi=\r\nde, make him sit down in a sofa, offer some refreshments, chat for a while,=\r\n serve some food, send off formally etc). When you receive two VIPs togethe=\r\nr, you can treat them together or separately and use different level of for=\r\nmality with them. The level of formality and protocol to be followed really=\r\n depends on how comfortable you are with them and how well you know them. T=\r\nhus, some shortcuts resorted to be some priests may be somewhat inappropria=\r\nte for normal people in the beginning. Thus, it is a good idea to formally =\r\ninvoke each deity. If you want to offer a specific mantra for a very small =\r\ncount, it is perhaps ok to offer without an invocation.\n \n*        *       =\r\n *\n \nSome priests give multiple poornaahutis. After finishing Ganapathi man=\r\ntra, they give one poornaahuti and they give one more after finishing Laksh=\r\nmi mantra and give one final &quot;Maha Poornahuti&quot; at the very end. As poornaah=\r\nuti means &quot;complete surrender&quot; and it is like a river going and merging in =\r\nan ocean, I think multiple poornaahutis are not really needed. When you giv=\r\ne one poornaahuti at the end, gods are not going to be confused who it is m=\r\neant for and fight over it. They know that it is for the underlying one god=\r\n within them. What is important is to instill a true sense of complete surr=\r\nender at poornaahuti time and meditate deeply.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short=\r\n Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas You=\r\nrself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.h=\r\nome.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n  ----- Orig=\r\ninal Message ----- \n  From: Dr. Paul om \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n \n  Sent: Friday, October 03, 2008 12:07 PM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] R=\r\night deity and sadhana (Re: Yogananda)\n\n\n  Hare Rama Krishna\n\n  Dear Narasi=\r\nmha Ji,\n           Pranaam,\n   Is there any way i can do a homam for Uschis=\r\nhtha ganesha and godess lakshmi together.

If you do not=\r\n know the \n            right deity, just doing some sadhana is definitely b=\r\netter than waiting. Pick \n            whatever deity seems natural to you a=\r\nnd do sadhana.\n\n            Please remember that sadhana for spiritual prog=\r\nress is different from \n            sadhana for specific material benefits.=\r\n No matter which deity you worship, \n            sadhana performed for spir=\r\nitual progress never goes waste. However, \n            sometimes it may be =\r\nnecessary to experience the results of some bad karmas \n            before =\r\nsome good things happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in a pile in a \n    =\r\n        basket. Suppose some of the really good karmas that will enable you=\r\n to do \n            serious sadhana and experience great things lie at the =\r\nbottom or middle of \n            the pile. When you start sadhana, suppose =\r\ngod decides to give you the fruits \n            of those auspicious karmas.=\r\n Imagine him reaching into the pile and \n            retrieving those karma=\r\ns. In the process, some other karmas may spill over \n            and give t=\r\nheir fruits. Some of those may be undesirable. So what? They had \n         =\r\n   to be experienced sometime or the other, anyway!\n\n            A serious =\r\nsadhaka should never be disheartened by a few seemingly \n            undesi=\r\nrable results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just keep going.\n\n       =\r\n     One gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a very good \n     =\r\n       priest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few days=\r\n, he was \n            laid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He c=\r\nontinued his sadhana \n            and used the break to go on an extended t=\r\nrip to India and make a pilgrimage \n            to some nice places. He par=\r\nticipated in the Shata Chandi homam we conducted \n            at the Kaalik=\r\nambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He met my guru and got \n            =\r\nthe opportunity to be his room mate for a week when we stayed at the house =\r\n\n            of a priest during the homam. He could observe and interact wi=\r\nth my guru \n            very closely. Most importantly, when my guru had a =\r\nvision of the Mother on \n            2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She t=\r\nold him to start the work on spreading \n            homam in the world, thi=\r\ns gentleman was present there. Though he could not \n            see the Mot=\r\nher, he actually smelled something out of the world and was \n            ba=\r\nffled. He knew something was going on, but did not know what. The temple \n =\r\n           was closed at the time and my guru and this gentlemen were the o=\r\nnly people \n            on the premises when the Mother appeared. Even thou=\r\ngh he could not see the \n            Mother, it was most fortunate of him t=\r\no be present there at *that* crucial \n            moment. That is enough to=\r\n mould the rest of his life.\n\n            You never know how, when and wher=\r\ne the grace of god falls on you. \n            Calculations and logic are us=\r\neless when it comes to the grace of god. Just \n            surrender and ke=\r\nep doing whatever sadhana you picked. If it needs \n            fine-tuning,=\r\n somebody will appear to tell you that. Any bad things that \n            ha=\r\nppen when doing a spiritual sadhana should be viewed as nature settling \n  =\r\n          some debts so that you are prepared to receive the fruits of some=\r\n really \n            auspicious karmas.\n\n            As Shirdi Sai Baba say=\r\ns, you should have &quot;sraddha and saburi&quot;. Have devotion \n            and pat=\r\nience. There is no limit to what you can get then.\n\n            Best regard=\r\ns,\n            Narasimha\n            ------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- -\n\n            Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n            Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana \n\n            Spirituality: http://gro=\r\nups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n            Free Jyotish lessons (MP3):=\r\n http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n\n            Free Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n            Sri Jagannath Centre (=\r\nSJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org \n\n            ------------ -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n            ----- Original=\r\n Message ----- \n            &gt; Namaste Sir\n            &gt; what you said makes=\r\n a lot sense and it was marvellous\n            &gt; but i have some small doub=\r\nts\n            &gt;\n            &gt; Leaving astrology aside and those who do not=\r\n have a guru\n            &gt; how can they chooose a particular form of GOD\n  =\r\n          &gt; bcoz in second part of AGHORA, Vimalanda, said choosing right d=\r\neity\n            &gt; is very important, as the analogy he gave of a person\n  =\r\n          &gt; who is greedy and worships LAKSHMI , may increase his greed\n   =\r\n         &gt;\n            &gt; One thing more\n            &gt; we have so many deiti=\r\nes that on diwali i would like to worship\n            &gt; Lakshmi and Kali\n  =\r\n          &gt; in navaratri (nowadays) we would worship Durga\n            &gt; on=\r\n janmashtami we would fast for KRISHNA\n            &gt; an on MAHASHIVARATRI f=\r\nor SHIVA\n            &gt; like this\n            &gt; with hte change in festival =\r\nthe deity changes\n            &gt;\n            &gt; though everybody knows GOD is=\r\n ONE but it becomes difficult to get\n            &gt; out of this\n            =\r\n&gt; mould and if i didnt worship her may be that GOD/GODDESS may become\n     =\r\n       &gt; angry\n            &gt;\n            &gt; I Know,this is my foolishness bu=\r\nt stiil this thing hangs in the mind\n            &gt;\n            &gt; One thing =\r\nmore\n            &gt;\n            &gt; Suppose if i choose a deity and something =\r\nwrong happens\n            &gt; (materiallistically )\n            &gt;\n           =\r\n &gt; what should i consider that my deity was helping me to clear my\n        =\r\n    &gt; DEBTS/WRONG DEEDS\n            &gt; or the NATURE was telling me to chang=\r\ne the DEITY as I am not fit\n            &gt; for that DEITY\n            &gt;\n    =\r\n        &gt; and sometimes you feel\n            &gt; o what am i doing does this =\r\nreally works\n            &gt;\n            &gt; and one thing more\n            &gt;\n =\r\n           &gt; what if we go on doing our pooja and someday\n            &gt; som=\r\nething like what happened to Pt.

First\n   =\r\n         &gt; he said he\n            &gt;&gt; did not know who the other person was =\r\nand said he would&#39;ve\n            &gt; probably known if\n            &gt;&gt; I had m=\r\nentioned the dream soon after it had happened. I left it\n            &gt; ther=\r\ne.\n            &gt;&gt; However, when we talked in the next weekend, he referred =\r\nto my\n            &gt; dream and\n            &gt;&gt; said he had an idea who it was=\r\n. He gave me a name and asked me to\n            &gt; search on\n            &gt;&gt; =\r\nthe internet for his photo and see if he was the person I saw in\n          =\r\n  &gt; my dream.\n            &gt;&gt; It was a guru from the lineage of Paramahamsa =\r\nYogananda (before\n            &gt; him). Though\n            &gt;&gt; he is apparentl=\r\ny well-known, I was not knowledegable about this\n            &gt; lineage and\n=\r\n            &gt;&gt; did not see his picture before. I searched on the internet a=\r\nnd\n            &gt; found a\n            &gt;&gt; photo. Interestingly, the photo was=\r\n very close to the person I saw\n            &gt; in my\n            &gt;&gt; dream. T=\r\nhe person that Manish transformed into in my dream looked\n            &gt; lik=\r\ne a\n            &gt;&gt; slightly younger version of that photo.\n            &gt;&gt;\n =\r\n           &gt;&gt; When I confirmed this to Manish, he only smiled and\n         =\r\n   &gt; said, &quot;Narasimha, there\n            &gt;&gt; are so many links between vario=\r\nus lineages. Leave it for now.&quot;\n            &gt;&gt;\n            &gt;&gt; Of course, I =\r\ndo not know much about kriya yoga or about the\n            &gt; lineage of\n   =\r\n         &gt;&gt; Paramahamsa Yogananda. Our lineage of this life starts from\n   =\r\n         &gt; Dattatreya. We\n            &gt;&gt; have a special attachment to Ramak=\r\nrishna Paramahamsa and his\n            &gt; lineage and got\n            &gt;&gt; a l=\r\not of our knowledge, inspiration and perhaps experience from\n            &gt; =\r\nthem. We do\n            &gt;&gt; not have any direct link to the lineage of Param=\r\nahamsa Yogananda.\n            &gt; But,\n            &gt;&gt; Manish thought there we=\r\nre some other indirect links. Moreover, he\n            &gt; guessed\n          =\r\n  &gt;&gt; who I saw, even though I myself had no idea who I saw, and he\n        =\r\n    &gt; guessed\n            &gt;&gt; correctly. That should count for something!\n  =\r\n          &gt;&gt;\n            &gt;&gt; I will not be surprised if there are indeed sub=\r\ntle connections\n            &gt; between\n            &gt;&gt; several lineages that =\r\nseem disjoint today.\n            &gt;&gt;\n            &gt;&gt; By the way, Swami Viveka=\r\nnanda also appeared in the prison cell of\n            &gt; Sri\n            &gt;&gt; =\r\nAurobindo (who wrote brilliant commentaries on Veda and Upanishad)\n        =\r\n    &gt; and\n            &gt;&gt; imparted him some Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobin=\r\ndo.\n            &gt;&gt;\n            &gt;&gt; * * *\n            &gt;&gt;\n            &gt;&gt; An in=\r\nteresting coincidence is that a swamiji from Puri contacted\n            &gt; m=\r\ne within a\n            &gt;&gt; few days after I saw that photo. His guru and Par=\r\namahamsa\n            &gt; Yogananda were\n            &gt;&gt; co-disciples of the sa=\r\nme guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). He is the\n            &gt; keeper of\n           =\r\n &gt;&gt; some astrological knowledge that his guru received from Yukteshwar\n    =\r\n        &gt; Maharaj.\n            &gt;&gt; He visited me after a month, discussed th=\r\nat knowledge and spent a\n            &gt; day at my\n            &gt;&gt; house. Thus=\r\n, some small connection was made with a representative\n            &gt; of tha=\r\nt\n            &gt;&gt; lineage soon after the dream. After all, some karmik debts=\r\n may\n            &gt; have been\n            &gt;&gt; there...\n            &gt;&gt;\n       =\r\n     &gt;&gt; * * *\n            &gt;&gt;\n            &gt;&gt; I want to make one thing clear.=\r\n\n            &gt;&gt;\n            &gt;&gt; Some things I mention like this may give the=\r\n impression that my\n            &gt; guru has\n            &gt;&gt; some psychic abil=\r\nities or siddhis. That may indeed be true. But he\n            &gt; always\n    =\r\n        &gt;&gt; downplays those things and attaches no importance whatsoever. He=\r\n\n            &gt; says,\n            &gt;&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I am a useless person and l=\r\nower than dirt and capable\n            &gt; of\n            &gt;&gt; nothing. It is a=\r\nll Her power. She is the connection between every\n            &gt; entity in\n =\r\n           &gt;&gt; this universe. She may choose an idiot like me as an instrume=\r\nnt\n            &gt; sometimes\n            &gt;&gt; and do something using me. I have=\r\n no special abilities of any\n            &gt; kind. Any\n            &gt;&gt; coincid=\r\nences you find are just Her grace and not due to me.&quot;\n            &gt;&gt;\n      =\r\n      &gt;&gt; I realized in time that this simplicity, humility and lack of ego\n=\r\n            &gt; is not\n            &gt;&gt; fake. I also realized that this lack of=\r\n ego is what enabled him to\n            &gt; do things\n            &gt;&gt; that sou=\r\nnd impossible or difficult. In fact, I realized that many\n            &gt; gre=\r\nat\n            &gt;&gt; saints in the past were like this. Several magical things=\r\n happened\n            &gt; through\n            &gt;&gt; them, but they did not find =\r\nany pride in them and retained their\n            &gt; humility\n            &gt;&gt; =\r\nand sense of surrender to their chosen form of god and believed\n           =\r\n &gt; that god\n            &gt;&gt; was the doer of all things and they were mere in=\r\nstruments.\n            &gt;&gt;\n            &gt;&gt; The day you also start believing t=\r\nhat, not for the sake of\n            &gt; lecturing or\n            &gt;&gt; posturin=\r\ng, but from the deep cores of your heart, your sadhana\n            &gt; will b=\r\near\n            &gt;&gt; fruit.\n            &gt;&gt;\n            &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n     =\r\n       &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n            &gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- -\n\n            &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n            &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana \n\n            &gt;&gt; Spirituality: htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n            &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish less=\r\nons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n\n            &gt;&gt; Free Jyotis=\r\nh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n            &gt;&gt; Sri Ja=\r\ngannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org \n\n            &gt;&gt;=\r\n ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n        =\r\n    &gt;&gt;\n            &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n            &gt;&gt; From: &quot;D=\r\ninesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt;\n            &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups.=\r\n com&gt;\n            &gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, September 29, 2008 5:54 PM\n            &gt;=\r\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Yogananda (Re: Dharma)\n            &gt;&gt;\n           =\r\n &gt;&gt;\n            &gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.=\r\n Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt;\n            &gt;&gt; wrote:\n            &gt;&gt; &gt;\n            &gt;&gt; &gt; Dear L=\r\nakshmi,\n            &gt;&gt; &gt;\n            &gt;&gt; &gt; The Yogananda I mentioned is diff=\r\nerent.

When you receive two =\r\nVIPs together, you can treat them \ntogether or separately and use different=\r\n level of formality with them. The level \nof formality and protocol to be f=\r\nollowed really depends on how comfortable you \nare with them and how well y=\r\nou know them. Thus, some shortcuts resorted to be \nsome priests may be some=\r\nwhat inappropriate for normal people in the beginning. \nThus, it is a good =\r\nidea to formally invoke each deity.

After finishing Ganapathi mantra, they give one poornaahuti and \nthey g=\r\nive one more after finishing Lakshmi mantra and give one final &quot;Maha \nPoorn=\r\nahuti&quot; at the very end. As poornaahuti means &quot;complete surrender&quot; and it is=\r\n \nlike a river going and merging in an ocean, I think multiple poornaahutis=\r\n are \nnot really needed. When you give one poornaahuti at the end, gods are=\r\n not going \nto be confused who it is meant for and fight over it. They know=\r\n that it is for \nthe underlying one god within them. What is important is t=\r\no instill a true sense \nof complete surrender at poornaahuti time and medit=\r\nate deeply.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Best \nregards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Do \na Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/=\r\nA&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do \nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg/tarpana&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: \n&lt;A=\r\n \nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free \nJyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fr=\r\nee \nJyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;=\r\n&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri \nJagannath Centre (SJC) website:=\r\n &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE \nstyle=3D&quot;PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-L=\r\nEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid; MARGIN-RIGHT: 0px&quot;&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV \n  style=\r\n=3D&quot;BACKGROUND: #e4e4e4; FONT: 10pt arial; font-color: black&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/B&gt; =\r\n\n  &lt;A title=3Ddrpaulom@... href=3D&quot;mailto:drpaulom@...&quot;&gt;Dr. Pau=\r\nl om&lt;/A&gt; \n  &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A title=3D=\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; \n  &lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt ari=\r\nal&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Sent:&lt;/B&gt; Friday, October 03, 2008 12:07 \n  PM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV style=3D=\r\n&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Right deity \n  and sa=\r\ndhana (Re: Yogananda)&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV dir=3Dltr&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;Hare=\r\n Rama Krishna&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;Dear Narasimha Ji,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Pranaam,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;Is there any way i can do a homam for Uschishtha ganesha and godess \n=\r\n  lakshmi together.

If you do not know the &lt;BR&gt;right deity,=\r\n just \n            doing some sadhana is definitely better than waiting. Pi=\r\nck \n            &lt;BR&gt;whatever deity seems natural to you and do \n           =\r\n sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please remember that sadhana for spiritual progress \n     =\r\n       is different from &lt;BR&gt;sadhana for specific material benefits. No \n  =\r\n          matter which deity you worship, &lt;BR&gt;sadhana performed for spiritu=\r\nal \n            progress never goes waste. However, &lt;BR&gt;sometimes it may be=\r\n \n            necessary to experience the results of some bad karmas &lt;BR&gt;be=\r\nfore \n            some good things happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in=\r\n a pile in \n            a &lt;BR&gt;basket. Suppose some of the really good karma=\r\ns that will \n            enable you to do &lt;BR&gt;serious sadhana and experienc=\r\ne great things lie \n            at the bottom or middle of &lt;BR&gt;the pile. Wh=\r\nen you start sadhana, \n            suppose god decides to give you the frui=\r\nts &lt;BR&gt;of those auspicious \n            karmas. Imagine him reaching into t=\r\nhe pile and &lt;BR&gt;retrieving those \n            karmas. In the process, some =\r\nother karmas may spill over &lt;BR&gt;and \n            give their fruits. Some of=\r\n those may be undesirable. So what? They \n            had &lt;BR&gt;to be experie=\r\nnced sometime or the other, anyway!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A \n            serious sadhaka s=\r\nhould never be disheartened by a few seemingly \n            &lt;BR&gt;undesirable=\r\n results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just \n            keep going.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali \n            from a v=\r\nery good &lt;BR&gt;priest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the \n            ma=\r\nntra for a few days, he was &lt;BR&gt;laid off and lost his job. He was \n        =\r\n    not perturbed. He continued his sadhana &lt;BR&gt;and used the break to go \n =\r\n           on an extended trip to India and make a pilgrimage &lt;BR&gt;to some n=\r\nice \n            places. He participated in the Shata Chandi homam we condu=\r\ncted \n            &lt;BR&gt;at the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. H=\r\ne met my \n            guru and got &lt;BR&gt;the opportunity to be his room mate =\r\nfor a week when \n            we stayed at the house &lt;BR&gt;of a priest during =\r\nthe homam. He could \n            observe and interact with my guru &lt;BR&gt;very=\r\n closely. Most \n            importantly, when my guru had a vision of the M=\r\nother on &lt;BR&gt;2006 \n            March 3 afternoon, in which She told him to =\r\nstart the work on \n            spreading &lt;BR&gt;homam in the world, this gentl=\r\neman was present there. \n            Though he could not &lt;BR&gt;see the Mother=\r\n, he actually smelled \n            something out of the world and was &lt;BR&gt;b=\r\naffled. He knew something \n            was going on, but did not know what.=\r\n The temple &lt;BR&gt;was closed at \n            the time and my guru and this ge=\r\nntlemen were the only people &lt;BR&gt;on \n            the premises when the Moth=\r\ner appeared. Even though he could not see \n            the &lt;BR&gt;Mother, it w=\r\nas most fortunate of him to be present there at \n            *that* crucial=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;moment. That is enough to mould the rest of his \n            life.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;You never know how, when and where the grace of god \n            falls =\r\non you. &lt;BR&gt;Calculations and logic are useless when it comes \n            t=\r\no the grace of god. Just &lt;BR&gt;surrender and keep doing whatever \n           =\r\n sadhana you picked. If it needs &lt;BR&gt;fine-tuning, somebody will \n          =\r\n  appear to tell you that. Any bad things that &lt;BR&gt;happen when doing a \n   =\r\n         spiritual sadhana should be viewed as nature settling &lt;BR&gt;some deb=\r\nts \n            so that you are prepared to receive the fruits of some real=\r\nly \n            &lt;BR&gt;auspicious karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As Shirdi Sai Baba says, you =\r\nshould \n            have &quot;sraddha and saburi&quot;.

I will&lt;BR&gt;&gt; continue in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the same vein for a \n            l=\r\nittle more time.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I had a dream a couple of \n       =\r\n     years ago early in the morning. In the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dream,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n   =\r\n         there was a big ritual fire. My guru Manish Pandit and I \n        =\r\n    were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sitting in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; front of the fire. He was \n        =\r\n    teaching me some pranayama techniques in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n     =\r\n       dream. Suddenly, he changed into somebody else that I could \n       =\r\n     not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; recognize.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; It was not anybody I had seen \n    =\r\n        before.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I mentioned this dream to my guru \n=\r\n            after a couple of weeks. First&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he said he&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; d=\r\nid \n            not know who the other person was and said he would&#39;ve&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; \n            probably known if&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I had mentioned the dream so=\r\non after \n            it had happened. I left it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; there.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n However, when \n            we talked in the next weekend, he referred to m=\r\ny&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dream \n            and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; said he had an idea who it was=\r\n. He gave me a name \n            and asked me to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; search on&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; the internet for his \n            photo and see if he was the person I =\r\nsaw in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my \n            dream.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; It was a guru from the li=\r\nneage of Paramahamsa \n            Yogananda (before&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him). Though&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; he is apparently \n            well-known, I was not knowledegable=\r\n about this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lineage \n            and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; did not see his pi=\r\ncture before. I searched on the \n            internet and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; found a&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&gt; photo. Interestingly, the \n            photo was very close to t=\r\nhe person I saw&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in my&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n            dream. The person th=\r\nat Manish transformed into in my dream \n            looked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like a&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&gt; slightly younger version of that \n            photo.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; When I confirmed this to Manish, he \n            only smiled a=\r\nnd&lt;BR&gt;&gt; said, &quot;Narasimha, there&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; are so \n            many lin=\r\nks between various lineages. Leave it for \n            now.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Of course, I do not know much about \n            kriya yoga or ab=\r\nout the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lineage of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Paramahamsa \n            Yogananda. =\r\nOur lineage of this life starts from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dattatreya. \n            We&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; have a special attachment to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa \n           =\r\n and his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lineage and got&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot of our knowledge, \n     =\r\n       inspiration and perhaps experience from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; them. We \n          =\r\n  do&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; not have any direct link to the lineage of \n            Pa=\r\nramahamsa Yogananda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Manish thought there \n       =\r\n     were some other indirect links. Moreover, he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n            gues=\r\nsed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; who I saw, even though I myself had no idea who \n          =\r\n  I saw, and he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; guessed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; correctly. That should \n       =\r\n     count for something!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I will not be surprised \n=\r\n            if there are indeed subtle connections&lt;BR&gt;&gt; between&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; \n            several lineages that seem disjoint today.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; \n            By the way, Swami Vivekananda also appeared in the pr=\r\nison cell \n            of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Aurobindo (who wrote bril=\r\nliant \n            commentaries on Veda and Upanishad)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; imparted \n            him some Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n            * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; An interesti=\r\nng coincidence is that a \n            swamiji from Puri contacted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; m=\r\ne within a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; few days \n            after I saw that photo. His gu=\r\nru and Paramahamsa&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yogananda \n            were&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; co-disci=\r\nples of the same guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). \n            He is the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nkeeper of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; some astrological knowledge \n            that his gur=\r\nu received from Yukteshwar&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Maharaj.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; \n            He vis=\r\nited me after a month, discussed that knowledge and spent \n            a&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; day at my&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; house. Thus, some small connection \n           =\r\n was made with a representative&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of that&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; lineage \n      =\r\n      soon after the dream. After all, some karmik debts may&lt;BR&gt;&gt; have \n=\r\n            been&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; there...&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * \n        =\r\n    *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to make one thing \n            clear.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Some things I mention like this may \n            gi=\r\nve the impression that my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; guru has&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; some \n            ps=\r\nychic abilities or siddhis. That may indeed be true. But \n            he&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; always&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; downplays those things and attaches no \n          =\r\n  importance whatsoever. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; says,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I am \n   =\r\n         a useless person and lower than dirt and capable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n        =\r\n    of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; nothing. It is all Her power. She is the connection \n   =\r\n         between every&lt;BR&gt;&gt; entity in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; this universe. She may=\r\n \n            choose an idiot like me as an instrument&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n           =\r\n sometimes&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and do something using me. I have no special \n      =\r\n      abilities of any&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kind. Any&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; coincidences you find =\r\n\n            are just Her grace and not due to me.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n I \n            realized in time that this simplicity, humility and lack of=\r\n \n            ego&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is not&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; fake.
