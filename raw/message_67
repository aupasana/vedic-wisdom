Guru is a =\r\nvery heavy word. It means the remover of the darkness of ignorance. I am NO=\r\nT a guru.\n \nIf She wants to answer something, She can pick someone and answ=\r\ner through them. The person in question is just a nimitta.\n \nActually, Vasi=\r\nshtha teaches that even a guru is a nimitta! Then what about someone like m=\r\ne? Everything here is just a coincidence. She is the master planner. If She=\r\n wants something to be given to someone, she will select somebody else as a=\r\n nimitta for it and make the second person give that thing to the first per=\r\nson. She is the energy that moves the entire universe. She is the ichcha sa=\r\nkti (desire), kriya sakti (action) and jnaana sakti (knowledge) of each bei=\r\nng in this creation. It is amazing how She plans the whole thing.\n \nShe is =\r\nlike a master film director who is making a secretive magnum opus. Imagine =\r\na director who has a really complicated script and shoots one scene with on=\r\ne set of actors and another scene with another set of actors etc. Each acto=\r\nr only knows the scenes (s)he is in. No actor can figure out the complete s=\r\ntory from the few scenes that (s)he knows. The Mother is like that. She has=\r\n a beautiful screenplay and we are all actors playing out roles. We only kn=\r\now a little bit of the story.\n \nSome people become too attached to the play=\r\n and start wondering what the complete story is. They waste their time and =\r\nenergy wondering what the complete story is or what the next scene is. This=\r\n does not improve their performance in their own scenes even one bit. On th=\r\ne contrary, this guesswork sometimes biases them and they end up messing up=\r\n their own scenes due to the mistakened biases.\n \nNow take an actor who lea=\r\nves it completely to the director, resigns to the mastery of the director a=\r\nnd just does what (s)he is told to do. Such an actor gives a perfect perfor=\r\nmance and does not waste any time or energy in unnecessary activities. Simi=\r\nlarly, one who realizes Her mastery and realizes that She is the doer of ev=\r\nerything and considers oneself a pawn in the hand of a master chess player =\r\ndoes not over-analyze everything and leads a blissful and fruitful life and=\r\n serves Her agenda perfectly.\n \nThis is not a direct comment on what you sa=\r\nid, but an extension of the previous streams of thought...\n \nThank you for =\r\nyour blessings.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcas=\r\nt.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri J=\r\nagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\n\n  ----- Original Message =\r\n----- \n  From: Amit Puri \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunda=\r\ny, June 17, 2007 8:57 PM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: vedic wisdom for=\r\n learners\n\n\n  parnam guru ji \n\n\n  thanks for such a nice mail ...... this m=\r\norning i was unable  to concentrate my mind on japa(it happen many time ) a=\r\nnd i was thinking to post a message to my own guru or in this group .......=\r\n.... and  with the blessing of mother as after japa i opened my box i read =\r\nyour message got my answer thanks for spreading knowledge keep it up may go=\r\nd bless you with more knowledge ,,energy and time to teach us.\n\n\n  Regard \n=\r\n\n  Amit puri\n\n  &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n    Dear Ki=\r\nshore,\n\n    There are so many practices that are geared towards creating di=\r\nscipline, reducing ego, overcoming the inner enemies and purifying oneself.=\r\n\n\n    Any practice will do. However, depending on who one was earlier and w=\r\nhat one did earlier, one may experience different levels of affinity toward=\r\ns different practices and also get results at different speeds with differe=\r\nnt practices.\n\n    Normal people can only give you good advice from THEIR p=\r\nerspective. They cannot give you advice from YOUR perspective. Only a sadgu=\r\nru, who knows more about the real you than you yourself do, can give you ad=\r\nvice from your perspective. Unfortunately, I am  not one.\n\n    If you want =\r\nmy suggestion nevertheless, here are some basic suggestions.\n\n    (1) In &quot;Y=\r\noga Vaasishtham&quot;, Maharshi Vasishtha prescribes company of saints as the fi=\r\nrst step in acquiring self-knowledge. Spend some time every week with spiri=\r\ntually inclined people discussing spiritual matters.\n\n    (2) Identify one =\r\npersonal weakness (e.g. anger, jealosy). Make a sincere effort to overcome =\r\nit. Whenever the weakness strikes you (e.g. you become angry), consciously =\r\nrestrain yourself and divert your mind to something else (e.g. repeating a =\r\nmantra).\n\n    (3) Take a mantra (e.g. Gayatri mantra). Spend atleast 30 min=\r\nutes everyday repeating that mantra. Sit comfortably with a reasonably stra=\r\night back and closed eyes and repeat the mantra. If your mind wanders off t=\r\nhe mantra and its deity and you get distracted by all kinds of thoughts, do=\r\n not worry. Accept it as the nature of mind and make a conscious effort to =\r\npull the mind back into the mantra and its deity.\n\n    (4) Before that japa=\r\n, do a simple pranayama for 5 minutes. Breath in through the right nostril =\r\nfor n seconds, breath out through the left nostril for n seconds, breath in=\r\n through the same left nostril for another n seconds and then breath out th=\r\nrough the right nostril for n seconds. Keep the time duration - n seconds -=\r\n approximately the same in all steps. If you want, you can use a small mant=\r\nra as the measure of time and say it mentally in each step. Keep repeating =\r\nthis sequence for 5 minutes.\n\n    (5) Cultivate the thinking that you do no=\r\nt own anything. Think that you are just a *temporary caretaker* of things t=\r\nhat seem like your possessions (e.g. you relations, your house, your car an=\r\nd even your own body, name, fame etc). Tell yourself that all these are god=\r\n&#39;s property and that you are servant and a temporary caretaker. Just as a s=\r\nervant working at a rich man&#39;s house takes excellent care of things entrust=\r\ned to him without developing the &quot;it is mine&quot; attachment to the things, tel=\r\nl yourself that you too have to take excellent care of all the things entru=\r\nsted to you (e.g. your relations, your house, your car, your body, name, fa=\r\nme etc) while cultivating the &quot;it is god&#39;s and not mine&quot; sense.\n\n    This i=\r\ns a very important step and just keep on trying if you keep failing.\n\n    (=\r\n6) Read a little of some scripture or teachings of a holy man everyday. Exa=\r\nmples are BhagavadGita, Jnaneshwari etc. I particularly recommend &quot;Gospel o=\r\nf Ramakrishna&quot;. Ramakrishna Parahamahamsa was a great master who taught the=\r\n highest knowledge in simplest terms to all kinds of people. Read his teach=\r\nings with an open mind, understand them and try to follow them.\n\n    *     =\r\n   *        *\n\n    If some previous karmas are blocking one&#39;s spiritual pro=\r\ngress, one has to either burn those karmas through sadhana or experience th=\r\ne result of the karmas. Then only the blockage will go away. There is no ot=\r\nher way.\n\n    Each minute spent in spiritual sadhana - including japam, hom=\r\nam etc - contributes to that. No effort is wasted. One should never get dis=\r\nheartened.\n\n    Best regards,\n    Narasimha\n    ---------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n    Homam manual and audio: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n    Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicast=\r\nro.home.comcast.net\n    Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org\n    Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannat=\r\nh.org\n    ----------------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n\n      ----- Original Message ----- \n      From: Kishore Chitrapu \n      To=\r\n: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n      Sent: Sunday, June 17, 2007 10:08 AM\n=\r\n      Subject: [vedic-wisdom] vedic wisdom for learners\n\n\n      Dear PVR,\n\n=\r\n      There is a profound gravitation towards the knowledge flowing here.

If your mind=\r\n \n    wanders off the mantra and its deity and you get distracted by all ki=\r\nnds of \n    thoughts, do not worry.
