Use the mental energy.\n\nAs Ramakrishna waited for Kali to give him darshan, he used to cry for Her. \nHe also used to cry as he waited for the arrival of his disciples such as \nNaren, Rakhal, Jogin, Tarak etc. The people around him then were unable to \nunderstand his teachings and he knew that his eternal companions who would \nspend a few years with him and then spread true spirituality in the world \nwere yet to come. He waited for several years and used to cry.\n\nA child who is lost by parents at a fair and is alone may cry in pain and \nconfusion, for parents. If one can become like that child and cry from the \nheart for deity or guru, one can get them. If you ask me, that is the best \nway.\n\nSome also recommend chanting mantras of Dattatreya or Shiva or Krishna to \nget one&#39;s guru. One can do that, but feeling from the depths of one&#39;s heart \nthe pain from the pangs of separation is vital.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, October 31, 2008 5:07 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] for guru\n\n\n&gt; Namaste to all,\n&gt;\n&gt; Can i ask one thing here that is there any simple thing like\n&gt; a mantra or some other thing which if done regularly\n&gt; will hwlp one take him to his guru and find one guru\n&gt; in a physical body\n&gt; after all we are not Lord Dattatreya who can take teachings from\n&gt; nature.\n&gt; If sb like your guru is there he can tell you in simple terms\n&gt; what to do for spiritual growth because daily obstacles sometimes\n&gt; take away you from your ultimate goal\n&gt;\n&gt; regards\n&gt; jitender\n\n\n"}}
