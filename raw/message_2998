In my case, oft=\r\nentimes have I found that after the initial enthusiasm of a few days, my co=\r\nncentration on the chanting/or on the meaning of the names declines and the=\r\n mind wanders to a great extent. But when I chant the phalasruti BEFORE cha=\r\nnting the actual Sahasranamam, my concentration registered an increase. The=\r\n reason behind this is not only the attraction of the fruits, the phala, me=\r\nntioned - it is the mere suggestion that certain fruits, whether material o=\r\nr spiritual, are attached to the chanting of these verses. That suggestion =\r\nhas helped my mind by creating more interest and an urge to focus on such g=\r\nreat names that could actually give such great results. In the case of the =\r\nVishnu Sahasranamam, a few verses mentioning the moksha-phala is anyway\n tr=\r\naditionally recited as Purva-Pithika. \n\nBest wishes,\nHari \n\n \n        Re: i=\r\ns chanting of phala sruthi required?      \n    \n    Posted by:      &quot;vedic_=\r\npathak&quot;      \n      vedic_pathak@...      \n              =A0\n        =\r\n\n          vedic_pathak \n        \n          \n    \n      Sun Nov=A01,=A02009=\r\n 10:22=A0am        (PST)    \n\n    \n                  \n\n\n      Namaste Punee=\r\nt,\n\n\n\nAlthough your questions are to Narasimha, i am writing few thoughts o=\r\nf mine hoping it&#39;ll not be inapporopriate.\n\n\n\nyou&#39;ve asked a very vital que=\r\nstion which would have confused many in\nthe past and many are facing dilema=\r\n presently.
