Thank=\r\n you for sharing it.\n \nAfter Ramakrishna left his body, several people saw =\r\nhim in embodied form.\n \nThat is entirely possible. When someone who did not=\r\n identify with a body but identified with the entire universe lives in a bo=\r\ndy and leaves, it is not like he has left. He is still there, in every atom=\r\n and in everything. If someone is attached to him with that body of his and=\r\n he has compassion for that person, he *can* give darshan to that person in=\r\n that body. It is not that he is &quot;alive&quot; or &quot;dead&quot;. It is just that he is i=\r\nn every atom or sub-atomic particle of this creation because he has realize=\r\nd the true nature of Self while living in the previous body and that realiz=\r\nation was intact even while leaving that body.\n \nAccording to Sarada Mata, =\r\nRamakrishna told her and Lakshmi that he would be back after 100 years and =\r\nthat all of them would have to be reborn when he is reborn after 100 years.=\r\n Thus, he may have already come to earth in a different body. But that does=\r\n not matter. Those who have an attachment to Ramakrishna and stuck at the l=\r\nower level form may still be able to access his previous form.\n \nEven after=\r\n the form of Rama left this world and the form of Krishna was born, a devot=\r\nee of Rama who does great tapascharya for Rama may be able to realize a dar=\r\nshan of the form of Rama.\n \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa was almost certainly an=\r\n avatara.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyot=\r\nish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software=\r\n (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websi=\r\nte: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: Ashwin Ra=\r\nwal \n  To: Vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Cc: pvr@... \n  Sent: Wed=\r\nnesday, November 05, 2008 10:25 AM\n  Subject: Shri Shri THAKUR is still ali=\r\nve today\n\n        Dear Sir, I would like to share one of my great Devine ex=\r\nperience about shri Ramkrishnadev. This is an unbelievable experience that =\r\nI have had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing exactly as =\r\nwas happened in my life. I am going back to the period of 1973/74. Kindly r=\r\nead this only when you are in religious mood.\n\n         \n\n        I was wor=\r\nking as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near Dwarka. My duty was from=\r\n 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance for extra duty. There wa=\r\ns a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post office and due to same Dep=E2=\r\n=80=99t; I had friendship with some Telephone operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai =\r\nPatel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel) was working as Operator. He was a st=\r\naunch devotee of    shri Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was a=\r\nlways talking about shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a week=\r\nly gathering at his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs c=\r\nreated by him and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna Kath=\r\namrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly meeting on Saturd=\r\nay evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30 then. We were used=\r\n to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours and were talking only abo=\r\nut Thakur.\n\n        One day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--=\r\n=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some guest have come to my home and my wife is remember=\r\ning me. My son will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go no=\r\nw=E2=80=9D. -- And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. \n=\r\n\n        At one another incident he told me that there will be a plane cras=\r\nh tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about him. He =\r\ncould foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he told me =\r\nnot to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I went to Bus sta=\r\ntion but bus did not come from Dwarka as was punctured on the way. This was=\r\n surprising.\n\n        This all incidents made me to believe that he had som=\r\ne super power and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attract=\r\ned to shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri Tha=\r\nkur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself to Thak=\r\nur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed him deeply =\r\nfrom my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his grace. \n\n        =\r\nNext day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning while taki=\r\nng the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was waking up at 5.45 morni=\r\nng. I told to my wife in the morning that I have accepted Shri Ramkrishnade=\r\nv as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and she argued with me a lot. =E2=80=\r\n=94=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision? Ramkrishna Paramhams=\r\na was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a great Saint but our Guru =\r\nshould be living one, who can guide us, give us Mantra etc. etc. Better you=\r\n take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya since you are doing Gayatri Mantra=\r\n=E2=80=9D--.\n\n        Her arguments were right at her place as people in ge=\r\nneral not know much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have=\r\n taken hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n\n        But=\r\n I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling their discip=\r\nles to test him before accepting him. I also decided to test Thakur. I imme=\r\ndiately told my wife that =E2=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has never come t=\r\no our home. You have also not seen him. He has never asked me where I am li=\r\nving. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house within 10 to 15 minutes, wou=\r\nld you believe that my selection for Thakur is perfect?=E2=80=9D--\n\n       =\r\n She laughed at me=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t bel=\r\nieve.=E2=80=9D--\n\n        I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediatel=\r\ny to justify my decision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your=\r\n existence even today.=E2=80=99\n\n        To our great surprise, Mr. Patel w=\r\nas at my home at 06.30 in the morning with angry mood. What he told?\n\n     =\r\n   =E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happened? =\r\nYesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my home at 05.30 morning=\r\ns today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur pulled my blan=\r\nket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s house. He is wai=\r\nting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his house=E2=80=9D\n\n    =\r\n    I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the way to you=\r\nr house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are disturbing him in su=\r\nch an early morning for such a silly things?=E2=80=99\n\n        We both were=\r\n so excited and surprised that we had no words that Morning. \n\n        I wi=\r\nll never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life. There were some m=\r\nore Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will write it sometime.\n\n   =\r\n     Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the earth=\r\n. This is a fact I have written and no word is added to exaggerate.  May Sh=\r\nri Thakur bless all of us.\n\n        Dr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad\n\n\n       \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0438_01C93F9A.572B0380\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;utf-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n=EF=BB=BF&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HT=\r\nML xmlns:o =3D &quot;urn:schemas-microsoft-com:office:office&quot;&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-=\r\nequiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Dutf-8&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=\r\n=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3429&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY =\r\nbgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Dear Ashwin ji,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;It is a very interesting episode you have narrated! \nThan=\r\nk you for sharing it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;After Ramakrishna left his bo=\r\ndy, several people saw \nhim in embodied form.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;That=\r\n is entirely possible.

Yet I went to Bus station \n        b=\r\nut bus did not come from Dwarka as was punctured on the way.

I was attracted to shri Thakur. One day I thought, I \n       =\r\n should also be disciple of shri Thakur and the day came. It was \n        4=\r\n/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s hous=\r\ne \n        before Thakur picture.

As my duty \n        was to start from 7 am I was waking up a=\r\nt 5.45 morning. I told to my \n        wife in the morning that I have accep=\r\nted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my \n        Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and she =\r\nargued with me a lot. =E2=80=94=E2=80=9CWhy should \n        you take such a=\r\n hasty decision? Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of \n        Maa Kali a=\r\nt Calcutta.

I also decided to test Thakur. I immediately told my wife =\r\n\n        that =E2=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has never come to our home. =\r\nYou have also not seen \n        him.
