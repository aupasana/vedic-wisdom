I remember reading some sto=\r\nries in Karthika \nPuranam \n&gt; of a cruel and sinful person calling his son w=\r\nhen he is about to \ndie. \n&gt; His son is named after Siva. Merely by calling =\r\nthe gods name \nbefore \n&gt; dying, the person attains punya loka! In another s=\r\ntory, a hunter \ndoes \n&gt; not get food on a Karthika Monday and goes to a tem=\r\nple hoping some \n&gt; left overs and as it is dark, lights a lamp, and he gets=\r\n the punya \nof \n&gt; upavasa and lighting the lamp. Neither of the above did t=\r\nhis \n&gt; intentionally. But, perhaps, both of them carried favorable karma \nf=\r\nrom \n&gt; their respective past lives!\n&gt; \n&gt; Remember the story of Kausikopakhy=\r\nanam? (Kaushika once looks \nangrily \n&gt; at a crane angrily and it burns to a=\r\nshes. That day Kushika goes \n&gt; begging and looks at a house wife angrily. T=\r\nhe lady tells him that \nshe \n&gt; is not the crane and surprised kaushika asks=\r\n for secret of her \n&gt; strength and she directs him to her teacher who sells=\r\n meat! The \n&gt; teacher explains Kaushika the importance of unattached karma.=\r\n Easy \nit \n&gt; sounds, but, not easy to practice.\n&gt; \n&gt; So, it is useless to a=\r\nrgue as to what is superior and what is \n&gt; inferior. All the different path=\r\ns are equally important and \nperhaps \n&gt; equally efficient provided we trave=\r\nrse that path efficently!\n&gt; \n&gt; Chittasudhi is important to what ever sadhan=\r\na we do for which \n&gt; controlling out wandering mind and focusing on the ult=\r\nimate goal \nis \n&gt; the single most challenge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Each of us may find diffe=\r\nrent ways to help us focus.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, I find doing the following 4 =\r\nto be useful:\n&gt; 1. Doing Japam while facing Sun\n&gt; 2. Doing Japam in front o=\r\nf a big portait of Ramakrishna/temple\n&gt; 3. Doing Japam while shower is runn=\r\ning on me\n&gt; 4. Doing Japam in front of Homam\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, do I need to find ou=\r\nt which of the above is more beneficial? \nI do \n&gt; not think so. If I can co=\r\nntrol my mind 100%, then the means does \nnot \n&gt; matter. I can do what ever =\r\nI feel comfortable at the time. For \nnow, I \n&gt; am doing homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; Each of=\r\n you can try it out and you feel it is helping you more \nstick \n&gt; to it.
