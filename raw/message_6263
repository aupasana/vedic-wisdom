A=\r\ns long as you stay simple and clear. Have to the point answered correctly f=\r\nor your questions with immigration you should have no difficulty. Confident=\r\nly and politely stick to your point. Your employer is that one that has to =\r\nsort out the facts, if he want&#39;s you, or else seek another employer. Immigr=\r\nation is abumch of rules and they can be bureacreatic and trying. Your empl=\r\noyer is the one that immigration is challenging, so work calmly with him. P=\r\nray to Vishnu and also the Simple God that assists called Shirdi SAI BABA. =\r\nIf you deserve it or if it is his grace to give you the fruits of even futu=\r\nre lifes&#39;s in this life, it will occur. Patience and Faith, Saburi and Shra=\r\nddha are his pillars of teaching for success. Ask a temple of Friend for Sa=\r\ni Vibhuthi. Wonderful miracles have occurred. Read about Shirdi Sai in vari=\r\nous places.\n&gt; \n&gt; May the fruit of your efforts pay you towards the path of =\r\nhappiness.\n&gt; \n&gt; A Friend\n&gt; \n&gt; Raj\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 4/30/11, vedic_pathak &lt;v=\r\nedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; Subjec=\r\nt: [vedic-wisdom] Re: After homam - Problems started - Please guide\n&gt; To: v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Received: Saturday, April 30, 2011, 5:39 AM\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
