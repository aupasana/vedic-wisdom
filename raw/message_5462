Ever since my childhood, primarily becau=\r\nse of my upbringing, I \nhave been trying and observing a lot of &quot;Good&quot; thin=\r\ngs. I have been reading texts \non spirituality and was a lot impressed by S=\r\nwami Vivekananda&#39;s writings. I \nalways found Kabir&#39;s following lines, as a =\r\nbest (and most compact) commentary on \nthe two prominent paths of spiritual=\r\nity: -\n\n&quot;Ek kahoon to hai nahee, do kahoon to gaari&quot;\n&quot;Hai jaisa taisa rahe,=\r\n kahat kabir vicharee&quot;\n\ni.e.\n&quot;If I say One, it is not, If I say two, it is =\r\ncontemplation&quot;\n&quot;Let it be what it is, says Kabir after contemplation&quot;\n\nUnti=\r\nl last year, my faith was getting stronger and stronger in my beliefs. Last=\r\n \nyear made gave me lot of troubles as well as lot of personal time to thin=\r\nk. I \nhave come up with several doubts (just a few given below) about spiri=\r\ntuality and \nGod and Goodness, and I have started to feel getting drifted t=\r\nowards atheism \n(susprisingly am writing all this on Vaikuntha Ekadashi, wh=\r\nen am observing a \nfast). If someone can help me understand the problesm wi=\r\nth my doubts, it would \nbe great help:- \n\n- Isn&#39;t &quot;Ishwar Paridhaan&quot; i.e. &quot;=\r\nIshwar yat karoti shobhanam karoti&quot; same as \nstockholm syndrome? \n- Most pe=\r\nople with good conduct I see these days are suffering and those who \nhappil=\r\ny claim themselves to be atheists, lead a prosperous life. Where is the \nsu=\r\npreme power&#39;s role in this. I know materialism is a different issue, but la=\r\nst \nyear made me realize that materialistic troubles made me very weak spir=\r\nitually \ntoo. So, I dont see them to be connected somehow.\n- I do understan=\r\nd that in Kali Yuga, the patience levels are low, and so called \nGodly corr=\r\nection of the wrong doing, takes its own time. But doesn&#39;t that \npromotes t=\r\nhe bad karma in itself, specially in this yuga? And how long can one \nwait?=\r\n\n- Suicide is considered a greatest sin, as it is throwing away the best gi=\r\nft we \nget from the lord. But, I am not sure that if people do it for fun. =\r\nGod presents \na person with tough situations in the name of testing times, =\r\nand some day the \nlimit is reached. Then isn&#39;t god accomplice in this so ca=\r\nlled crime.\n- In first place, why does he need to test us?\n\nAs I said that =\r\nall these question make me feel that I am losing the faith in His \ngoodness=\r\n. All my spiritual progress if any has been corrupted by these testing \ntim=\r\nes. And no help came to me(I could not figure out). And those who did offer=\r\n, \nfaced a lot of troubles themselves and are also suffering now. This is w=\r\nhat \nmakes me go mad about it, as I am unable to bear this that I have pass=\r\ned my \nagony to someone.\n\nDespite all these thoughts that have pre-occupied=\r\n my mind for quite some time, I \nfeel that I still survive a chance to get =\r\nback to my faith in real terms and not \ndriven by materialistic desire. Thi=\r\ns is the reason I am writing this mail. May \nbe someone can make me see wha=\r\nt I am missing here. Else, I see myself getting \ntotally crazy, insane and =\r\nmoving towards atheism and quit possibly committing \nthe so called &quot;Sin&quot;.\n\n=\r\nRegards,\nSri\n\n\r\n--0-474085984-1292572732=:33010\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=3D&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/he=\r\nad&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:&#39;times new roman&#39;, &#39;new york&#39;, times, se=\r\nrif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;Dear All,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have tried to=\r\n make spiritual progress for long, and made little progress (but not signif=\r\nicant).
