I visited that temple once and was impressed with the attitude of people running it.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; Devi Upasaka must never cut Sugarcane since it\n&gt; is held in the hands of the goddess.\n \nA few points:\n \n(1) Sugarcane is crushed to make sugar and jaggery, which we all use. If cutting sugarcane offends the Mother because she holds it, won&#39;t crushing sugarcane offend her?\n \n(2) If you are cutting the sugarcane &quot;in her hand&quot; to feed &quot;her son&quot; (Ganesha) one of his favorite foods, do you really think the Mother will be angry with you?\n \n(3) Seriously and philosophically speaking, does one really think that the divine Mother has an attachment to physical sugarcane that she is depicted as holding?\n \n*        *        *\n \nPhysical forms of deities described in scriptures are symbolic. Of course, one who thinks of a physical form may have a vision of a deity in that form. However, such a form is basically symbolic of higher truths.\n \nFor example, what does sugarcane denote? It gives rise to sweetness. However, it does not come without effort. You have to cut, crush and squeeze sugarcane in order to extract the sweet and nutritious juice from it. Mother&#39;s holding of sugarcane is symbolic of the fact that She gives sweet knowledge and bliss, which come after serious effort.\n \n*        *        *\n \nDeities are personifications of higher states that can be attained by our consciousness. All the weapons, jewelery and other things held by deities are symbolic of various things given by them or used by them to fight our weaknesses.\n \nOf course, some orthodox practices and beliefs may have evolved around taking such symbols literally. Those who want to follow may follow and those who want to move on may move on. \n \n*        *        *\n \nI personally see absolutely no problem in offering sugarcane pieces in homam, if one has a big enough fire to burn those pieces fully. However, if &quot;Devi upasakas&quot; belonging to lineages that ban the cutting and use of sugarcane want, they may kindly follow the teachings of their gurus and avoid sugarcane pieces.\n \nAt the end of the day, external rituals are symbols and internal changes denoted by those symbols will slowly be triggered after repeated performance of the ritual. If an external symbolic action robs one of peace and creates a sense of wrong-doing or inauspiciousness or guilt in one&#39;s mind, it is not worth it! Either remove the sense of wrong-doing through reasoning or stick to orthodox rules you are exposed to.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n&gt; Narasimha ji\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been doing homam for Lord Ganesha and have been using pieces of fresh sugarcane also as offering for the Lord. I happenned to recently study the magazine published by the Rochester Devi temple and they specifically mentioned in one of the articles that a Devi Upasaka must never cut Sugarcane since it is held in the hands of the goddess.\n&gt; \n&gt; I also remember something to the effect of &quot;Ikshu Khandam &quot; should not be offered in some of the devi puja manuals.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Lalithopasako na iskshu khandam bhakshayet&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been only offering it out of sincere love for Lord Ganapati since felt he is extremely fond of Sugarcane .Often have read your writing stating that one must not be afraid to approach god and must take up homa with the mind of a child . \n&gt; \n&gt; Please do advice if I could continue to offer the pieces or if am committing a grave mistake by offending the goddess .\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Vemparla Ram Kishore \n\n\n"}}
