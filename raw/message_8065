They fall around the two main six-monthly equinoctial divisions o=\r\nf the year and have special temporal and spiritual significance. The import=\r\nance of morning and evening sandhya (specific prayer-rituals) at the junctu=\r\nres of day and night in daily life is also because of this. The wise do not=\r\n waste this time in eating, sleeping and other mundane affairs. Rather they=\r\n use this time for prayers and meditation like sandhya-vandan, self-contemp=\r\nlation and self-refinement, because at a subtle level these times are so ch=\r\narged with harmonizing vibrations that even small effort in sadhana bear ex=\r\ntraordinary fruit. \n\nDuring this auspicious confluence of seasons, the subt=\r\nle nature undergoes great changes. In the Puranas, it is even held that the=\r\n seasons remain in a state of menstruation for the nine days. Just as a men=\r\nstruating woman has to observe a certain discipline about food, thoughts an=\r\nd conduct, even so during the transitional time-slots of dawn and dusk, one=\r\n ought to remain in a calm and receptive mental and physical condition. Acc=\r\nording to arogyashastra (the normative science of health), too, this nine-d=\r\nay period generates a tidal wave in the physical life force, which nullifie=\r\ns and expels whatever toxic elements had accumulated in the body during the=\r\n preceding six months on account of irregularities in food and living sched=\r\nule. Routine bodily imbalances like fever, cough, cold, etc. should be cons=\r\nidered a natural symptom of this elimination process. Similarly, there is a=\r\nn enhanced flow of vital spiritual energy all around during the Navaratri p=\r\neriod.\n Therefore, sadhana done during this period fructifies with multiple=\r\n benefits ranging from expulsion of toxic wastes from the body and mind to =\r\nthe bestowal of divine gifts of fulfillment of noble aspirations. Those wit=\r\nh intuitive insight (prajna) never miss the special occasion of Shakti- sad=\r\nhana (Shakti - the energy aspect of Divinity) during the Navaratri Parvas. =\r\n\n\nThis sadhana takes different forms. The devotees of Ram read the Ramayana=\r\n while that of Krishna, the Gita or Srimadbhagvat. The Devi-worshippers dev=\r\note themselves to different forms of Durga-stuti. Ascetics undertake rigoro=\r\nus penance and austeristies. \n\nIn tantric cults, Shava- sadhana (sadhana wi=\r\nth a corpse), Kumari-pujan (worship of a maiden), Kundalini-jagaran (awaken=\r\ning the kundalini), chakra-vedhan (piercing extra-sensory energy centres) a=\r\nnd other such practices are especially undertaken during this period. The p=\r\nrajna-parijans perform the mini anusthana of Gayatri sadhana in the form of=\r\n 24 thousand mantra-japas. \n\nIt is necessary to grasp the essence of Navara=\r\ntri - anusthana propounded by our rishis. According to them, Navaratri symb=\r\nolizes the nine doors or sense organs, which are situated in the Ayodhya of=\r\n the human body. Through misuse or abuse, bred by ignorance, they are clogg=\r\ned with dross. Hence, through anusthana, we have to reflect on all the door=\r\ns (one door each night) and by cleansing them awaken the divine potencies l=\r\natent in them. Indeed, this is the real meaning of Navaratri - sadhana. For=\r\n want of self-restraint and discipline, all the inner energy gets drained o=\r\nut of these outlets making the individual emaciated, feeble and poor. Throu=\r\ngh sadhana, this wasteful discharge of energy is checked and the purpose of=\r\n Shakti- sadhana fulfilled. \n\nIn the anusthana, the sadhak, with solemn inn=\r\ner determination, conducts himself within a set frame work of discipline an=\r\nd austerities and adopts a specific method of upasana (worship). He thereby=\r\n engages in refining and purifying his inner-self. In the course of mini Ga=\r\nyatri anusthana of 24 thousand japas, a daily japa of 27 rosaries of the ma=\r\nntra recitation is prescribed which, at normal pace, is completed in 3 to 4=\r\n hours. If a novice is unable to recite the full Gayatri mantra, he can sti=\r\nll complete the requisite number of japas with the five-syllable Gayatri &quot;O=\r\nm bhurbhuva=C2=A1 sva=C2=A1&quot;. This takes only one hour daily. The Navaratri=\r\n - sadhana done with reverential faith (Shraddha) fructifies with miraculou=\r\ns effects with respect to self-elevation. This is because Gayatri is the su=\r\npreme creative energy, which bestows virtuous qualities and enhances the el=\r\nements of divinity and spirituality in the body, mind and soul of the sadha=\r\nk. This is the royal highway to\n self-realization. \n\nA question may arise h=\r\nere that Navaratri is associated with the worship of Durga and so, how is G=\r\nayatri anusthana related with it. One should know that Durga - Mahakali is =\r\na form of Gayatri Mahashakti. Durga is the name of the form of the supreme =\r\nforce that destroys whatever is base, evil and dark. The worship of Durga i=\r\nn her nine external forms is done precisely with a view that she destroys t=\r\nhe vices, which have taken root in our sense-consciousness. It is the sinfu=\r\nl tendencies / instincts of man that are the Mahisasur (the buffalo-demon).=\r\n In Navaratri, an attempt is made to restrain and throw out of our psyche t=\r\nhose tendencies through mental resolve and regulated conduct. A self-contro=\r\nlled and purified soul is endowed with the power of Durga, Mahakali or Gaya=\r\ntri. This very force, upon refinement of inner consciousness, becomes the d=\r\nestroyer of Mahisasur (mahisasur mardini). \n\nDuring Navaratri anusthana, me=\r\nditation is sought to be intensified and focused with japa to maintain the =\r\nflow of mind towards deeper and higher rages of consciousness. In sakara up=\r\nasana or worship of a visible form of Divinity, contemplation is on the Ido=\r\nl of Gayatri or the Gurusatta, while worshippers of the nirakara (indetermi=\r\nnate or attributeless) concentrate on the Sun and its radiating rays as Gay=\r\natri Shakti. When the appropriate mood is achieved, the mind turns effortle=\r\nssly to the Mother-sentiment (Matribhava), lips continue automatically with=\r\n the japa and the fingers with the beads of rosary, and the mind is absorbe=\r\nd in receiving uninterrupted affection and energy from the Mother. In this =\r\nperiod, one should specially engage in introspection. The mind should be ke=\r\npt free from anxieties and distractions as for as possible. In introspectio=\r\nn, there should be an attempt to evaluate the direction of life led so far,=\r\n to consciously be aware of the\n negativities within oneself and to outline=\r\n concrete course of action for their rectification through self-refinement =\r\nand penance. A firm resolve should be made to inculcate the qualities of ex=\r\ncellence and goodness in life. An effective programme should be chalked out=\r\n for integration of the elements of sadhana, svadhyaya (study and contempla=\r\ntion), sanyam (self-control) and seva (service of the needy) in life so tha=\r\nt there emerges a composite way of life in which self-development goes side=\r\n-by-side with due observance of familial and social responsibilities. Thus,=\r\n if a clearer and better outline of the future course of life could be form=\r\ned and confidence be generated to implement it during Navaratri sadhana, it=\r\n should be deemed that one has received an immediate prasada (divine grace)=\r\n of Mother Gayatri. It should be clearly understood that only through noble=\r\n deeds could we actualize our higher potentials and be the rightful recipie=\r\nnts of God=E2=80=99s grace. \n\nSome basic rules of Navaratri sadhana should =\r\nbe strictly followed. Important ones among these are fasting, continence, s=\r\nleeping on a hard bed, not taking service from others, and keeping the dail=\r\ny routine well regulated and disciplined. \n\nThese apart, at the mental plan=\r\ne, too, one should try to remain in an exalted state of happiness, goodwill=\r\n, calm, peace and contemplation. Even while engaged in meeting your normal =\r\ndaily obligations, the sadhak should remain immersed in Ista-remembrance an=\r\nd keep oneself free from envy, jealousy, idle-gossip and slander. Maintain =\r\nyour mental poise even in adverse circumstances. All creatures of the world=\r\n are the progeny of Mother Gayatri. The Mother indwells all. This awareness=\r\n should be the basis of all activities of the sadhak while heading the path=\r\n of sanyam, svadhyaya, sadhana and seva and inspiring others, too, to do th=\r\ne same. \n\nThe Navaratri sadhana completed in this lofty state of mind and w=\r\nithin the framework of the above mentioned prescriptions will certainly pro=\r\nve to be the bestower of heavenly blessings of Gayatri Mahashakti and Gurus=\r\natta on the sadhak. The sadhak must participate in the Havana (offerings in=\r\nto the sacred yagya-fire) on the purnahuti day praying for universal peace,=\r\n well-being, and happiness with every oblationSource: http://www.akhandjyot=\r\ni.org/?Akhand-Jyoti/2004/Sept-Oct/BestowerCelestialBoons/\n\n\nSubhamasthu\nKK\r\n--1819627952-692414549-1332573472=:37201\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Pranamam,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;TABLE border=3D0 cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 width=3D570 height=3D454&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR vAlign=3Dcenter align=3Dmiddle&gt;\n&lt;TD class=3Dbig height=3D55 co=\r\nlSpan=3D2&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;STRON=\r\nG&gt;Navaratri Sadhana: The Bestower of Celestial Boons&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD height=3D167 vAlign=3Dtop colSpan=3D2 align=3Dmiddle&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nTABLE border=3D0 cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 width=3D550&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;TD class=3Dtext2 height=3D86 vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3Djustify&gt;The festiv=\r\nals of &lt;A title=3D&quot;Worship of The Divine as Mother is a special characteris=\r\ntic of the Indian Culture.
