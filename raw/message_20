Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;=\r\n \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; We are living in Kali yuga and Kali is b=\r\necoming deeper. We cannot \ntrust that \n&gt; every standard convention is based=\r\n on sound knowledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; One of my favorite sookt=\r\nas is &quot;Devi Sooktam&quot; from Rigveda. It is \nattributed \n&gt; to Vagambhrani, a f=\r\nemale rishi. She felt oneness with the Divine \nMother in \n&gt; Her undivided s=\r\nupreme form (nearly nirguna form) and the riks of \nDevi \n&gt; sooktam were rev=\r\nealed to her then. Those eight riks are really \nfantastic.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are o=\r\nther riks in Rigveda that were revealed to the world by \nfemale \n&gt; rishis. =\r\nWe use those riks in our worship, meditation, homas and \nother \n&gt; sadhanas.=\r\n Yet, should we insist that women cannot recite Veda? If \n&gt; Vagambhrani is =\r\namid us again as a woman, should we stop her from \nreciting \n&gt; Devi sooktam=\r\n?\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Jnaneshwar (or Jnanadev) was a great saint =\r\nfrom Maharashtra from \nabout 800 \n&gt; years back. He was a great devotee of K=\r\nrishna and was a fully self-\nrealized \n&gt; master at a young age. He reformed=\r\n religion and corrected some \ncorrupt \n&gt; traditions. He once made a buffalo=\r\n chant Veda.\n&gt; \n&gt; He started to recite Veda and the head of the Brahmin cou=\r\nncil \nforbade him \n&gt; because he was not &quot;qualified&quot; to recite Veda. Jnanesh=\r\nwar insisted \nthat \n&gt; everyone had a right to recite Veda and the head of t=\r\nhe council \ndisagreed. \n&gt; As he started reciting Veda, the Brahmins tried t=\r\no stop him by \nclosing his \n&gt; mouth. Then a buffalo standing next to him to=\r\nok over and chanted \nVeda. \n&gt; Astounded by the miracle, the Brahmins fell a=\r\nt his feet. The head \napologized \n&gt; and said, &quot;we are masquerading as the k=\r\neepers of Veda, but you have \nthe real \n&gt; understanding and mastery of Veda=\r\n&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Jnaneshwar taught the equality of all and did not distinguish \nbetw=\r\neen people \n&gt; based on caste, creed or gender. He considered BhagavadGita a=\r\ns the \nessence \n&gt; of Veda and wrote a fantastic commentary on it. His comme=\r\nntary \ndeparts from \n&gt; the standard Dwaitic (dualistic) point of view adopt=\r\ned by most \nVaishnava \n&gt; gurus and uses a purely Adwaitic (non-dualistic) p=\r\noint of view. It \nis a \n&gt; priceless and timeless masterpiece.\n&gt; \n&gt; *       =\r\n *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; One Swamiji who was at my house last month had an interest=\r\ning take. \nHe said \n&gt; that the belief that women cannot recite Vedas is bas=\r\ned on a \n&gt; misinterpretation. He said that the physical body we have is cal=\r\nled \nthe \n&gt; &quot;stree sareera&quot; and the inner body we have is called the &quot;purus=\r\nha \nsareera&quot;. \n&gt; He said that the physical body comes from mother and the s=\r\noul comes \nfrom \n&gt; father and that is why they are called so. The soul or i=\r\nnner self \nis the \n&gt; thousand-headed purusha within us (described in purush=\r\na sooktam).\n&gt; \n&gt; He said that Veda is supposed to be recited with the purus=\r\nha \nsareera. \n&gt; According to him, it does not mean that women cannot read i=\r\nt. \nWhether men or \n&gt; women, they have to read it with the purusha sareera,=\r\n i.e. inner \nbody, and \n&gt; not just with the physical body. So, according to=\r\n him, the standard \n&gt; convention is based on a flawed understanding. Accord=\r\ning to him, \none simply \n&gt; reciting Veda with the mouth without the correct=\r\n internal \nunderstanding is \n&gt; only reading with the &quot;stree sareera&quot; and he=\r\nnce not doing the right \nthing.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, reci=\r\nting Veda and chanting the verses is one thing and \n&gt; understanding them is=\r\n quite another. When we make sound, there are \nfour \n&gt; levels of it - vaikh=\r\nari, madhyama, pasyanti and para. Vibration of \nmaterial \n&gt; belonging to th=\r\ne gross body (sthoola sareera) produces vaikhari \nlevel of \n&gt; sound and it =\r\nis heard through the senses belonging to the gross \nbody (ears). \n&gt; But vib=\r\nrations at the level of subtle body (sookshma sareera) and \nvibrations \n&gt; a=\r\nt the level of astral body (kaarana sareera) are also there and \ncan be \n&gt; =\r\nperceived thorough subtle perception.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one is chanting &quot;Om Namo Nara=\r\nyanaya&quot; and thinking of some \nmundane \n&gt; matters, the vibrations produced a=\r\nt levels above vaikhari will not \nbe \n&gt; auspicious. There is so much stress=\r\n on what we do physically and \npeople \n&gt; forget that what happens at the ot=\r\nher layers of existence is \nequally, if not \n&gt; more, important!\n&gt; \n&gt; If you=\r\n produce the correct vibrations at all levels (not just \nphysical) \n&gt; while=\r\n &quot;reciting&quot; any Vedic mantra, you can truly &quot;experience&quot; the \nmantra. A \n&gt; =\r\nfull experience of a single Vedic mantra may be sufficient to alter \none&#39;s =\r\n\n&gt; life! The mantras of Veda are most powerful. Unfortunately, so much \nof =\r\nVedic \n&gt; scholarship these days is only superficial (but it has to be \nenco=\r\nuraged, \n&gt; because it will keep atleast one level of knowledge alive).\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Forget the man vs woman controversy. The difference between genders \nis on=\r\nly \n&gt; in the gross body. When you go to the subtle body and astral body, \nt=\r\nhere is \n&gt; no difference at all. One should realize that the role of gross =\r\n\nbody is too \n&gt; limited in the correct recitation/experience of a Vedic man=\r\ntra. It \nis the \n&gt; purity of the subtle body and the lightness of the astra=\r\nl body that \nare far \n&gt; more important.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; To be=\r\n fair and balanced, I need to throw light on the other angle. \nLike I \n&gt; sa=\r\nid, Vedic mantras are too powerful. They are capable of producing \na full \n=\r\n&gt; self-realization (actually the sole purpose of Veda is &quot;to know \nself&quot;). =\r\n\n&gt; However, given the depth of Kali Yuga, it is difficult for it to \ncome i=\r\nn one \n&gt; shot. It comes in steps. When one is half way down the path, one \n=\r\nhas to be \n&gt; careful and under the vigilant guidance of a sadguru.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whe=\r\nn one is not fully realized and the gross body has a role to \nplay, there \n=\r\n&gt; are some differences based on the gender that come into play.\n&gt; \n&gt; If a l=\r\nady carrying a baby in her womb has certain spiritual \nexperiences \n&gt; (whic=\r\nh a good Vedic chanting is capable of bringing), there can \neven be an \n&gt; a=\r\nbortion (or a great siddha being born, on the other extreme).\n&gt; \n&gt; There is=\r\n another subtle factor. Good Vedic chanting can bring an \nawakening \n&gt; of K=\r\nundalini (i.e. an awakening of self-awareness) and an ascent of \n&gt; Kundalin=\r\ni (i.e. an ascent of self-awareness). Though some people \nmay have a \n&gt; wro=\r\nng impression about Kundalini because of the corrupt practices \nof a \n&gt; sec=\r\ntion of so-called &quot;Kundalini sadhakas&quot;, the fact is that \nKundalini merely =\r\n\n&gt; represents one&#39;s ego-consciousness. When one casually associates \nthe bo=\r\ndy \n&gt; one sees with &quot;self&quot;, Kundalini is asleep in the Mooladhara chakra. \n=\r\nAs one&#39;s \n&gt; self-awareness becomes more and more refined, Kundalini ascends=\r\n in \nthe \n&gt; sookshma sareera. As one has a perfect self-realization, Kundal=\r\nini \nreaches \n&gt; Sahasrara. Whether one thinks in these terms or not, Kundal=\r\nini \nmoves based \n&gt; on how evolved one is. Whether one is into Bhakti yoga =\r\nor Raja yoga \nor Karma \n&gt; yoga or Jnana yoga does not matter. All paths lea=\r\nd to an awareness \nof a more \n&gt; and more correct concept of self as time pr=\r\nogresses and a full \n&gt; self-realization finally. Accordingly, Kundalini ris=\r\nes more and \nmore and \n&gt; reaches Sahasrara at the end.\n&gt; \n&gt; During the peri=\r\nod when Kundalini is stuck in Swadhishthana chakra, \nsexual \n&gt; drive can mu=\r\nltiply. Several yogis get stuck in this stage and fail \nthe tests \n&gt; to pro=\r\ngress further. In general, women have a higher drive than \nmen. If that \n&gt; =\r\ndrive multiplies, there can be a difficult situation. However, it \nreally \n=\r\n&gt; depends on the individual and we cannot generalize.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, there are =\r\nsome practical difficulties on the way, which may \nhave made \n&gt; some people=\r\n come up with some rules. However, are those issues \nsufficient to \n&gt; ban w=\r\nomen from reciting Veda? I don&#39;t think so. In fact, the \nfactors I wrote \n&gt;=\r\n above are probably irrelevant given the superficial understanding \nof Veda=\r\n \n&gt; present at this time and the superficial recitation of Veda that we \nfi=\r\nnd \n&gt; these days.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, if you want to be sure and do not want to misgu=\r\nide anyone, it \nis better \n&gt; to not give any advice. Leave it to one&#39;s sadg=\r\nuru. If you have a \nsadguru who \n&gt; is guiding your spiritual sadhana, surre=\r\nnder and do as your guru \nsays! What \n&gt; is good for goose may not be good f=\r\nor gander. What goose&#39;s guru \ntaught to \n&gt; goose may be good only for goose=\r\n and not for gander. Gander will do \nwell to \n&gt; follow gander&#39;s guru.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nI think I rambled enough for today... :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; =\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Homam ma=\r\nnual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons=\r\n (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows=\r\n): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: htt=\r\np://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;rohinipurang&quot; =\r\n&lt;rohinipurang@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, F=\r\nebruary 24, 2007 12:18 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] reading/learning the ve=\r\nda\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;A warm namaste to everyone!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have heard it said that w=\r\nomen are not allowed to \nread/know/recite the\n&gt; &gt; vedas.
