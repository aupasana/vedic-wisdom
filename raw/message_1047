First thing i told him \nthat &#39;Hindu&#39; is a foreig=\r\nn word and none of our scripture uses this \nword.\n\n***\n\nThis is my long tim=\r\ne belief that Sanaatan Dharma will never perish. \nmy logic is simple. in th=\r\ne recorded history, People from Sanaatan \nDharma has never attacked the oth=\r\ner religion. The glorious example \n(which i am very proud of quoting) is Pa=\r\narasi Community. They came to \nIndia for saving their community and religeo=\r\nn and our people niether \nrejected them nor influenced them to convert in t=\r\no our religeon. they \nflourished in our country in trade.\n\n***\n\nWhen Sanaat=\r\nan Dharma was in great danger, Lord sent Shivaaji to \ncontrol it. earlier A=\r\nddi Shankara camedown for it. Now it is our \nresponsibility to see to it th=\r\nat we live its value in our life. and \nwe need not forget the famous assura=\r\nnce &quot;Sambhavaami Yuge yuge!&quot;\n\nbut is everybody&#39;s duty to do their bit so th=\r\nat this glorious \nTradition of Sanaatan Dharam never gets diminished.\n\nbest=\r\n Regards,\n\nUtpal \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;ra=\r\njarshi14@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Very true indeed. Hinduism has=\r\n faced some of the severest assults \nacross histroy from various groups of =\r\ninvaders, we do not have a \ncentral religious authority governing all Hindu=\r\ns and yet Hinduism \nexists inspite of severe persecution that it had faced =\r\nfrom other \nreligions.=C2=A0It is truely amazing.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; And this too i=\r\ns correct, as you said, Sanatan Dharma can never \nperish.

To Hindus, the \ncorrect term \n&gt; =\r\nis &quot;sanatana dharma&quot;, i.e. perennial spirit of righteousness. By \ndefinitio=\r\nn, \n&gt; it is perennial. I am firmly convinced that it cannot be destroyed. \n=\r\nEven if \n&gt; it seems close to extinction, it will come back up. That is the =\r\n\nnature of \n&gt; this dharma. I am not worried about Sanatana dharma being dam=\r\naged \nor \n&gt; destroyed.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will continue to discharge what *I* believe n=\r\nature expects from \n*me* and \n&gt; what I believe is *my* dharma, without any =\r\nworry whatsoever that \nsanatana \n&gt; dharma is in some kind of danger of exti=\r\nnction. However, such a \nbelief is \n&gt; vital for some people to discharge *t=\r\nheir* dharma and hence we have \nsome \n&gt; people driven by that sense of dang=\r\ner and the resulting fear and \nanger.
