Understand the rare gift it is to =\r\ncome into contact with such a pure guru.  Listen quietly and sincerely to t=\r\nhe untainted words of such a genuine guru and allow yourself to learn and a=\r\nbsorb his teachings to you. Make yourself worthy of such a gift.  The great=\r\nest offense (guru-aparadha) that we can commit against the guru is to arrog=\r\nantly treat the guru as an ordinary person. The guru is not our buddy. The =\r\nguru is not our colleague. The guru is not our therapist. The guru is not o=\r\nur employee.  The true guru is the self-realized sage who will guide us awa=\r\ny from our self-imposed illusion and toward the spiritual emancipation for =\r\nwhich our innermost heart yearns. The true guru is our personal savior.&quot; - =\r\nPg.73\n\n\nIn this book of inspirational and enlightening teachings, we gain a=\r\n precious and rare glimpse of the very essence of Sanatana Dharma, as well =\r\nas practical guidance for how we can practice Dharma, meditation, self-real=\r\nization and Yoga spirituality in an authentic, meaningful and effective way=\r\n. This book is meant for the serious spiritual seeker. If you can fully und=\r\nerstand and apply its teachings to your life, with humility, sincerity, ope=\r\nnness and enthusiasm, your life will be radically transformed.\n\nGet your co=\r\npy today at:\n\nhttp://dharmacentral.com/dharmastore/Living_Dharma.php\n\n\n\nPle=\r\nase forward this message to all sincere spiritual seekers.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
