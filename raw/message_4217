You can find some answers in the archives. I will briefly answer again.=\r\n\n\nOn your first point: Yes, Lord Krishna did indeed say in the 10th chapter=\r\n of BhagavadGita: &quot;yaGYaanaam japayaGYo.asmi&quot; (of all sacrifices/rituals, I=\r\n am the japa yajna, i.e. chanting of mantras).\n\n* * *\n\nWe can get it in rig=\r\nht perspective by noting that the very previous line says &quot;I am Om among al=\r\nl mantras&quot;.\n\nYes, Om represents the pure and absolute essence of universe. =\r\nHowever, is it possible for everyone to meditate just using &quot;Om&quot; and reach =\r\ngod? Probably not. Are Krishna devotees leaving other mantras such as the m=\r\nahamantra (Hare krishna mantra) and doing japam only with &quot;Om&quot;, because Kri=\r\nshna said I am &quot;Om&quot; among mantras? Of course, not.\n\nSame thing holds to jap=\r\nam vs other sadhanas such as homam.\n\nJust as one may need ropes and other g=\r\near to climb mount everest, one may need to employ mantras other than &quot;Om&quot; =\r\nand practices other than &quot;japam&quot; to overcome one&#39;s short-comings and reach =\r\nthe summit of the absolute, represented by Om (and all other things mention=\r\ned by Krishna).\n\n* * *\n\nWhen you do an external sacrifical ritual such as h=\r\nomam, your body is engaging in actions. So your mind has to be attached to =\r\nthe body and use it in a particular way. Can one reach samadhi while doing =\r\nhomam? Unlikely. One is more likely to reach samadhi when one stops the ext=\r\nernal actions. Mind may be withdrawn completely from the body and absorb fu=\r\nlly in the mantra at some stage then.\n\nFrom the point of view, japam (sitti=\r\nng still and meditating on a mantra) is the ultimate sadhana.\n\nHowever, not=\r\n everyone can reach god like that. There are so many vasanas (conditioning)=\r\n in the mind that needs to be purged/purified slowly. Until that is done, j=\r\napam may not help one reach god. Until then, taking the help of an external=\r\n pure object (such as fire) that has a purifying effect on one&#39;s subtle con=\r\nsciousness can be helpful. It *prepares* one for good japam.\n\n* * *\n\nA lot =\r\nof priests do homam and then leave the fire and go away. In the homam manua=\r\nls, I have made it a point to insist that people do japam with their favori=\r\nte mantra at the end of the homam, while sitting still with closed eyes. Th=\r\ne idea is that homam purifies subtle consciousness and *prepares* one for r=\r\neaching god, while it is finally japam that takes one to god. After every h=\r\nomam, one&#39;s internal purity is at a maximum (a local maximum, temporally sp=\r\neaking - sorry for the technical jargon) and japam will be more fruitful th=\r\nan at other times.\n\n* * *\n\nNow onto other questions:\n\n(1) It is unfruitful =\r\nin the sense that it does not take you closer to god. It is fruitful in the=\r\n sense that it stops you from going much further away from god. After all, =\r\nif you weren&#39;t engaged in that japam and you were doing some other activity=\r\n, probably your mind will wander even more.\n\nI suggest looking at disturbin=\r\ng thoughts in the middle of a japam as a heckler interrupting your speech. =\r\nInstead of arguing and fighting with the heckler, simply take note of him, =\r\npause for a second and move on. Instead of panicking or worrying, simply ta=\r\nke note of your thoughts, pause for a second and move on.\n\n(2) Mantra means=\r\n that which protects (tra) the mind (mana). Various vasanas (conditioning) =\r\nare pulling the mind in different directions to react to various situations=\r\n in various ways and that activity tires out the mind. You protect it by an=\r\nchoring it in a mantra and teaching it to overcome the pulls of vasana.\n\nTh=\r\ne proof of whether a mantra or japam or homam is working for you or not is =\r\nwhether there is a slow internal transformation in you or not, whether your=\r\n internal reaction to various external things is changing for the better or=\r\n not.\n\n(3) Difficult. This is where a good guru is helpful.\n\nActually, in t=\r\nhis age, technical perfection is almost ruled out. I suggest doing whatever=\r\n one does with a sense of surrender and humility. If there is something par=\r\ntly correct that somebody is doing, it will slowly increase with time and N=\r\nature will remove imperfections with time.\n\n(4) I can write Obama&#39;s name an=\r\nd Gordon&#39;s name on sheets of paper next to me and pretend that they came th=\r\nere and sat there. Will they really do it? On the other hand, if I am a wor=\r\nld leader holding a summit, probably I can make them actually come and sit =\r\nthere.\n\nNyasa means placement. When you do nyasa, you place various vibrati=\r\nons (sound patterns) or energies (deities) in various body parts. For most =\r\nof us with distracted minds, it is merely a formality and means nothing. On=\r\nly a sadhaka with a pure, pointed and focused mind can actually place vario=\r\nus vibrations and energies in various body parts.\n\nI always suggest to peop=\r\nle to do nyasa as taught by elders (so that the knowledge lives and is pass=\r\ned on), but not worry too much about it.\n\nAs I said, we are in the midst of=\r\n deepening Kali and the level of sadhakas is not as high as in the old days=\r\n. Technical perfection will become rarer and rarer. It is better to focus o=\r\nn surrender and humility.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotis=\r\nh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homa=\r\nm and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nFilms that make a diff=\r\nerence: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ =\r\ngroup/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/Jyoti=\r\nshWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n-\n\n---- Veneet Kumar &lt;kveneet@yahoo. com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; In the Bhagvata Gita, K=\r\nrishna says that I am &quot;Japa&quot; amongst all Yajnas.
