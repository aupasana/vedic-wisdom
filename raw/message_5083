I was inclined to borrow it so I did. When I read it I=\r\n felt that I am reading just another version of Aghora Volumes. Things writ=\r\nten in Aghora are also mentioned in it (Obviously not the story line but th=\r\ne facts related to saadhna). While reading I was suddenly inclined to share=\r\n about this in this group so I am writing here. This book will be helpful f=\r\nor people who believe that Lot of things are written in between the lines i=\r\nn Aghora and are unable to understand that &#39;in between the line&#39; content ma=\r\ny find it helpful. This book may not add anything much if you have already =\r\nunderstood that &#39;in between the line&#39; content but it will be helpful if you=\r\n are trying to do so.  Some details about the book are as under.\n\nThis Book=\r\n is about Yogi Vamacharan who lived about the same time as RamaKrishna Para=\r\nmansa lived. Book also mentioned that vamacharan met Telanga Swami and also=\r\n describe meeting with Telanga swami. A Granth was written by Shri Sushil K=\r\numar Vanshopadyay dedicated to Vamacharan which was published in 1954. This=\r\n was translated in Hindi by Shri Chhavinath Mishra in 2001\n\nName: Tarapeeth=\r\n Bhairav\nPublisher: Vaamdev Sangh, Shri Ramendranath Basu, 8, Pramanik Ghaa=\r\nt Road, Kaashipur, Kolkata. 700036.\n\nWith the grace of Maa Tara\n\nRegards\nAt=\r\nul\n\n\n\n"}}
