Her chosen God was Lord Viswanath of Benare=\r\ns.\nHowever, when she was going to Benares for good she had a dream in which=\r\n\nLord Viswanath told her to return to Arunachala, saying that Bhagavan Rama=\r\nna\nwas the embodiment of Rama,Krishna, Siva and all other Gods.\n\n\nI LOST MY=\r\n HUSBAND when I was sixteen. I went back to my mother&#39;s house and\nlived the=\r\nre as a widow should, trying to pray to and meditate on God. My\nmother&#39;s mi=\r\nnd too was devoted to the spiritual quest and religion was the\nmain thing i=\r\nn her life.\n\nOnce we went on a pilgrimage to Kaveri Pushkaram and on our wa=\r\ny back we\nstopped at Arunachala.\n\nThere we were told that a young Brahmin s=\r\naint had been living on the hill\nfor the past ten years.\n\nThe next morning =\r\nwe went up the hill along with others with whom we were\ntravelling. At Mula=\r\nipal Tirtha we cooked our food, ate and had some rest.\nThen we went further=\r\n and found the young Swami near Virupaksha Cave. There\nwas a brick platform=\r\n at the entrance of the cave and he was sitting on it.\n\nAs soon as I saw hi=\r\nm, I was at once convinced that God Arunachala Himself\nhad come in human fo=\r\nrm to give salvation to all who approached Him.\n\nHe was about thirty at the=\r\n time, and wonderful to look at; he was bright and\nshining like burnished g=\r\nold, his eyes were blooming and clear, like the\npetals of a lotus. He looke=\r\nd at us for a long time.\n\nThe peak of Arunachala was towering over our head=\r\ns, the huge towers of the\ntemple were below and an immense silence surround=\r\ned the Swami.\n\nThen the ladies started whispering. One wanted to pray for a=\r\n child for her\ndaughter-in-law who was barren, but another was saying that =\r\nthe Swami was\ntoo exalted for such worldly matters. Finally the Swami was t=\r\nold of the\nyoung wife&#39;s sorrow. He smiled and lifted his folded hands to th=\r\ne sky as if\nsaying : &quot;All happens by the will of the Almighty.&quot;\n\nWe returne=\r\nd to Nellore and the impression of that visit faded away. I did\nnot even dr=\r\neam at that time that my life would be spent at the feet of the\nSwami.\n\nWhe=\r\nn I was thirty-one I went to Rameshwaram on a pilgrimage and on my return\nj=\r\nourney I stopped at Tiruvannamalai. I learned that the Swami was then\nlivin=\r\ng at the foot of the hill. That afternoon we went to see him at his\nAshrama=\r\n. There was a thatched shed over his mother&#39;s samadhi and a tiled\nhall for =\r\nmeeting the Swami. He was seated on a couch and about a dozen\ndevotees were=\r\n on the bare floor. We sat in silence for ten minutes and\nreturned to the t=\r\nown.\n\nBhagavan&#39;s presence gave me the experience of inner silence and menta=\r\nl\nstillness, but away from him I could not regain it and I spent a year vai=\r\nnly\ntrying to free myself from all thought. Some friends were going to see =\r\nSri\nAurobindo&#39;s Ashrama at Pondicherry and they took me along. They were to=\r\n stay\nthere for a week. I was not much impressed and went for a short visit=\r\n to\nRamanasramam.\n\nA learned Shastri whom I knew appeared in my dream and a=\r\nsked me: &quot;Where was\nthe need for you to go to Pondicherry? Entrust yourself=\r\n to Bhagavan Sri\nRamana Maharshi. He is God Himself. He will surely lead yo=\r\nu to salvation.&quot;\n\nBut even such a clear dream was not enough. I cherished a=\r\n plan of going to\nBenares and spending my life there in holy austerities. I=\r\n decided to go to\nBhagavan, learn from him how to meditate, and then leave =\r\nfor Benares for\ngood. My friend Parvatamma decided to join me in the spirit=\r\nual adventure.\nAccordingly we went to Tiruvannamalai and rented a house. In=\r\n the afternoon\nwe took cashew nuts and sugar candy as an offering to Bhagav=\r\nan and went to\nthe Ashrama. We placed our offerings on a stool before him a=\r\nnd sat down. The\ncow Lakshmi happened to be lying near Bhagavan&#39;s sofa. She=\r\n got up and began\nto chew our precious offerings. Bhagavan looked on and sa=\r\nid nothing. His\nattendant, Madhava Swami, did not even look. We thought it =\r\nmight be impious\nto disturb the cow, but soon I got exasperated and exclaim=\r\ned, &quot;Please remove\nthe cow !&quot; Madhava Swami replied: &quot;Why? I thought you of=\r\nfered those sweets\nto Lakshmi !&quot;\n\nWhat is Atma?\n\nThe next day at noon I was=\r\n again at Ramanasramam. His midday meal over,\nBhagavan was reclining on the=\r\n sofa and explaining a verse from the Bhagavad\nGita to Sri Ramiah Yogi. As =\r\nno one else was in the hall, I gathered courage\nand asked: &quot;What is Atma?\n\n=\r\nIs it the limitless ether of space or the awareness that cognizes\neverythin=\r\ng?&quot;\n\nBhagavan replied:\n\n&quot;To remain without thinking &#39;this is Atma&#39; and &#39;tha=\r\nt is Atma&#39;, is itself\nAtma.&quot;\n\nHe looked at me and I felt my mind melt away =\r\ninto nothing. No thought would\ncome, only the feeling of immense, unutterab=\r\nle peace. My doubts were\ncleared.\n\nEvery day I would visit Bhagavan and lis=\r\nten to his talks with the devotees.\nDeep in my mind there was the same rock=\r\n-like stillness, immensely solid and\nyet strangely vibrant.\n\nSeveral times =\r\nI was invited to work in the Ashrama, but the Ashrama ways\nwere not orthodo=\r\nx enough for me. One day Bhagavan&#39;s own sister asked me to\ntake her place i=\r\nn the Ashrama, for she had to leave for some time. I could\nnot refuse. At t=\r\nhat time Santammal was the chief cook and my duty was to\nhelp her. To my gr=\r\neat joy Bhagavan was in the kitchen with us most of the\ntime. He taught me =\r\nto cook tastily and neatly.\n\nI would spend all day in the Ashrama and in th=\r\ne evening I would go to the\ntown to sleep, for there was no sleeping accomm=\r\nodation for women in the\nAshrama.\n\nOnce Bhagavan said:\n\n&quot;You widows do not =\r\neat vegetables like drumsticks and radish. Diet\nrestrictions are good to st=\r\nrengthen the will.\n\nBesides, the quality of food and the manner of eating h=\r\nave an influence on\nthe mind.&quot;\n\nI was very happy to work in the kitchen dir=\r\nectly under Bhagavan&#39;s\nsupervision; yet I wanted to go home. The Ashrama wa=\r\nys were too unorthodox\nfor me. And there was too much work. I did not want =\r\nto work all day long. I\nwanted to sit quietly and meditate in solitude.\n\nI =\r\nLeave the Ashram\n\nSo I left again for my village and I went away for about =\r\na year. I divided\nmy time between idleness and meditation. Yet my heart was=\r\n at the Ashrama. I\nwould tell myself: &quot;Where is the need of running about. =\r\nIs not Bhagavan here\nand everywhere?&quot; But my heart was calling me to Bhagav=\r\nan. Even when I was\npleading with myself, that in the Ashrama there would b=\r\ne no time for\nmeditation, my heart would say: &quot;Working in the kitchen by hi=\r\ns side is far\nbetter than meditation.&quot; At home I had all the leisure I want=\r\ned, but it\nseemed to me that I was wasting my time.\n\nLater I learned that t=\r\nhat was the time Bhagavan used to remember me very\noften. Once they were pr=\r\neparing pongal (pulse with rice and black pepper) to\ncelebrate Bhagavan&#39;s m=\r\nonthly birth-star (Punarvasu) and Bhagavan told\nSantammal:\n\n&quot;Subbalakshmi i=\r\ns far away yet she worries whether pongal is cooked here\ntoday or not.&quot;\n\nOn=\r\n some other festival day Bhagavan announced:\n\n&quot;Subbalakshmi will turn up; k=\r\neep some pongal for her.&quot;\n\nThat very day I arrived at the Ashrama.\n\nHis gre=\r\nat love for me, a worthless devotee, bound me firmly to his feet.\nAgain and=\r\n again I wanted to leave the Ashrama, but he held me for my good,\nmore powe=\r\nrfully than I held on to him.\n\nWhenever I was collecting courage to tell Bh=\r\nagavan about my desire to leave,\nhe would seem to read my thoughts and fore=\r\nstall me by giving me something\nspecial to do. I felt I had too much to do =\r\nand that my life was being\nwasted. One day Bhagavan was looking at me inten=\r\ntly and said:\n\n&quot;It looks as if you are still hankering after meditation.&quot;\n\n=\r\nI replied: &quot;What have I got except endless work in the kitchen?&quot; Bhagavan\ns=\r\naid with deep feeling:\n\n&quot;Your hands may do the work but your mind can remai=\r\nn still.\n\nYou are that which never move Realize that and you will find that=\r\n work is\nnot a strain.\n\nBut as long as you think that you are the body and =\r\nthat the work is done by\nyou,you will feel your life to be an endless toil.=\r\n\n\nIn fact, it is the mind that toils, not the body.\n\nEven if your body keep=\r\ns quiet, will your mind keep quiet too?\n\nEven in sleep the mind is busy wit=\r\nh its dreams.&quot;\n\nI replied: &quot;Yes, Swami, it is as natural for you to know th=\r\nat you are not\nyour body as it is for us to think that we are the body. I h=\r\nad a dream\nrecently in which you were explaining this very point. I was dre=\r\naming that I\nwas working in the kitchen and you were having your bath in yo=\r\nur usual place\nbehind the bamboo mat partition.\n\nYou asked:\n\n&#39;Who is it?&#39;\n\n=\r\nI replied: &#39;Who shall I say I am?&#39;\n\nYou said:\n\n&#39;Exactly so, you are nothing=\r\n of which something can be said.&#39;\n\nNow, just remember that was my dream and=\r\n it was quite clear. Why can&#39;t I\nremember always that I am not the body?&quot;\n\n=\r\n&quot;Because you haven&#39;t had enough of it,&quot; he smiled.\n\n\nDo Not Torture The Bod=\r\ny\n\nI used to fast quite often, as advised in some scriptural texts. In one =\r\nof\nthe books, I read: &quot;He who wants to know himself and yet pays attention =\r\nto\nhis body is like a man who trusts a crocodile to take him across a river=\r\n.&quot;\n\nI showed the text to Bhagavan and he explained:\n\n&quot;It does not mean that=\r\n you should starve.\n\nYou need not torture the body.\n\nIt only means not givi=\r\nng the body more than it needs.\n\nWith your mind, hold on to enquiry and jus=\r\nt keep the body going so that it\ndoes not become a hindrance.For this, pure=\r\n and fresh food,simply prepared\nand taken in moderation,is a great help.&quot;\n\n=\r\nAnother day I asked Bhagavan&#39;s permission to put on the sannyasin&#39;s orange\n=\r\nrobes and beg for my food. He said:\n\n&quot;Will coloured clothes give you renunc=\r\niation?\n\nFirst learn what sannyasa means.&quot;\n\nOnce five or six devotees sat d=\r\nown before Bhagavan and sang a hymn in praise\nof the Guru. He got up in the=\r\n middle of the recitation and went away,\nsaying:\n\n&quot;Prayers and praises will=\r\n not take one far.\n\nIt is the merciful look of the teacher that bestows tru=\r\ne knowledge.&quot;\n\nI felt elated. Had I not received his merciful glances? But =\r\nthe next day he\nwas saying:\n\n&quot;Unless one becomes a six month old baby there=\r\n is no hope for him in the\nrealm of self-knowledge.&quot;\n\nMy heart sank. Althou=\r\ngh I lived in the presence of Lord Arunachala Himself,\nI was far from becom=\r\ning an infant.\n\nWhy Should You Doubt?\n\nAnother time Bhagavan was telling us=\r\n stories from the lives of devotees of\nbygone ages. I questioned him: &quot;It i=\r\ns written that God appeared before the\ndevotee and shed His grace on him wh=\r\nile he was still in his mother&#39;s womb.\nCan it be true?&quot;\n\nTo that Bhagavan r=\r\neplied:\n\n&quot;Why should you doubt? Will doubt profit you?\n\nOnly your devotion =\r\nwill suffer.\n\nThose stories are as real as your telling me that you are pre=\r\nsent here and\nnow.&quot;\n\nBhagavan was one day reading and explaining Tirupugazh=\r\n in Tamil to\nAlamelammal of Madura.\n\nI did not know Tamil and I could only =\r\nlook on. I saw a change in Bhagavan. A\nlight was shining from within him. H=\r\nis face was radiant, his smile was\nbeaming, his eyes were full of compassio=\r\nn. His words reverberated in the\nmind and were instantly and deeply underst=\r\nood.\n\nAll my being was carried upwards on a current of strange vibrations. =\r\nThe\nmemory of this experience is ever present in my heart.\n\nA great joy has=\r\n remained with me that I was privileged to sit at the feet of\nthe Divine Be=\r\ning.\n\nIt was ever like this with him.\n\nWhoever went to him, he would go dow=\r\nn to his level; his words and gestures,\neven the intonation of his voice, w=\r\nould adapt themselves to the make-up of\nthe people around him. With childre=\r\nn he was their playmate, to family people\n- a wise counsellor, to pundits -=\r\n a well of knowledge, to yogis - the God of\nwill, the God of victory. He sa=\r\nw himself in them and they saw themselves in\nhim and their hearts would be =\r\nbound to his feet in everlasting love.\n\nAll who came to see him would be ch=\r\narmed by his love and kindness, beauty\nand wisdom, and the overwhelming sen=\r\nse of unity he radiated like fire\nradiating heat.\n\nTo some he would grant a=\r\n special vision, invisible to others; with some he\nwould openly discourse.\n=\r\n\nCrowds would gather round him and each one would see him differently. Even=\r\n\nhis pictures differ. A stranger would not guess that they are all of the\ns=\r\name person.\n\nGrant Me Salvation, Swami\n\nOne afternoon a lady from Kumbhakon=\r\nam sat near Bhagavan and exclaimed: &quot;How\nglad I am that I have met you, Swa=\r\nmi. I have craved to see you for a long\ntime, Swami. Not that I want anythi=\r\nng, Swami. Only please be kind and grant\nme salvation, Swami.&quot; With that sh=\r\ne got up and went away.\n\nBhagavan had a hearty laugh.\n\n&quot;Look at her - all s=\r\nhe wants is salvation.\n\nGive her salvation, she wants nothing else.&quot;\n\nI sai=\r\nd: &quot;Is it not what we all want?&quot;\n\nHe replied:\n\n&quot;Is salvation something to b=\r\ne handed over on request?\n\nDo I keep bundles of salvation concealed about m=\r\ne, that people should ask me\nfor salvation?\n\nShe said &#39;I do not want anythi=\r\nng.&#39;\n\nIf it is sincere, that itself is salvation.\n\nWhat is there I can give=\r\n and what is there they can take?&quot;\n\nSomebody brought a bell to be rung at t=\r\nhe arati ceremony and it was put into\nBhagavan&#39;s hands. He tried its sound =\r\nin various ways and laughed:\n\n&quot;God wants us to make a fire of our past evil=\r\n deeds and burn our karma in\nit.\n\nBut these people burn a copper worth of c=\r\namphor and hope to please the\nAlmighty.\n\nDo they really believe that they c=\r\nan get something for nothing?\n\nThey do not want to bend to God,they want Go=\r\nd to bend to them.In their greed\nthey would swallow God,but they would not =\r\nlet him swallow them.\n\nSome boast of their offerings.\n\nWhat have they got t=\r\no offer ?\n\nThe idol of Vinayaka (Ganesha) is made of jaggery.\n\nThey break o=\r\nff a piece of it and offer it to Him.\n\nThe only offering worthy of the Lord=\r\n Is to clear the mind of thoughts and\nremain steady in the peace of Self.&quot;\n=\r\n\nIn the early days, when I joined the Ashrama, Bhagavan used to help in\ngri=\r\nnding lentils, peeling vegetables and even lending a hand in cooking. He\nwo=\r\nuld get up long before daybreak to join the kitchen staff at their work.\nWe=\r\n ladies would arrive by sunrise, and Bhagavan would see that all was ready\n=\r\nfor our arrival and we would often find a part of our work already done.\n\nT=\r\no forestall him we would come by five; he would come at four; we would come=\r\n\nthen at three. When he saw that we were left without sleep, he stopped\nent=\r\nering the kitchen before sunrise and gave us time to sleep.\n\nHe was the ver=\r\ny embodiment of wisdom and kindness, though he did not mind\nour faults and =\r\nmistakes,\n\nHe made us follow his instructions to the letter.\n\nWe had to do =\r\nthe same task again and again until it was done to his complete\nsatisfactio=\r\nn. Did he do it for himself? Of what use was it to him?\n\nHe wanted to prove=\r\n to us that we could do things right,\n\nthat only lack of patience and atten=\r\ntion causes all the mess.\n\nHe sometimes seemed too severe, even harsh, to m=\r\nake us do something\ncorrectly, for he knew what we did not know that we can=\r\n act correctly if we\nonly try.\n\nWith experience came confidence, and with c=\r\nonfidence the great peace of\nrighteousness.\n\nIn daily life he avoided all d=\r\nistinction. At work and at food he was one of\nus. But in the hall, seated o=\r\nn the sofa, he was the great Lord of Kailas,\nthe Holy Mountain.\n\nWhenever B=\r\nhagavan would enter or leave the hall, we would all get up\nrespectfully. On=\r\ne could see that he did not like so many people being\ndisturbed because of =\r\nhim.\n\nHe wanted us to learn well the lesson that God is present in every be=\r\ning in\nall his glory and fullness and must be given equal reverence. He was=\r\n\ntireless in hammering this lesson into our minds and hearts, and he would\n=\r\nruthlessly sacrifice the little comforts we so loved to provide for him, as=\r\n\nsoon as he noticed a trace of preference.\n\nThe law that what cannot be sha=\r\nred must not be touched was supreme in his\nway of dealing with us.\n\nSeparat=\r\nive and exclusive feelings are the cause of the &quot;I&quot; and therefore the\ngreat=\r\nest obstacles in the realization of the One. No wonder he was\nexterminating=\r\n them so relentlessly.\n\nOnce Bhagavan had jaundice. He had to be put on a f=\r\nruit diet, but he would\nnot eat fruit unless all ate, and in equal quantiti=\r\nes too! Where could we\nget such a lot of fruit? Yet he was adamant and woul=\r\nd leave his share\nuntouched unless he saw an equal share on everybody&#39;s lea=\r\nf-plate.\n\nThose who say that a sick man needs special food and must not giv=\r\ne trouble,\nmiss the point. Bhagavan was not sick. His body had jaundice, th=\r\nat was all. He\nwanted to impress on our minds that under no condition must =\r\na man have a\ngreater share. Our learning this lesson was more important to =\r\nhim than the\ncure of his jaundice.\n\nTo serve him at mealtimes was by itself=\r\n a dangerous adventure.\n\nOur womanly desire was to fill him to the brim. Hi=\r\ns rule was to clear the\nplate no matter what or how much was served. Not a =\r\nspeck of food would be\nleft uneaten.\n\nSo we had to be watchful and serve mu=\r\nch less than what we would like to. It\nwas not easy and we would often fail=\r\n. He would scold us bitterly, or, what\nwas infinitely worse, would fall ill=\r\n and suffer.\n\nI cannot understand how he managed to produce an illness when=\r\n a lesson was\nneeded, but our life with him was crisis after crisis.\n\nHe wo=\r\nuld take any amount of trouble to teach us the virtues necessary for\nself-d=\r\niscovery. Our life in the Ashrama was a school of yoga, and a hard\nschool t=\r\noo. For book-knowledge was as nothing to him; only character and\ngenuine sp=\r\niritual experience counted.\n\nWith time he ceased working in the kitchen, bu=\r\nt we could still find him in\nthe dining hall. When all would leave after fo=\r\nod, he would linger on his\nseat and we would collect around him and chat an=\r\nd listen to his precious\nwords. He would teach us and guide us and we would=\r\n forget the years that\npassed and be again the happy crowd of yore.\n\nChange=\r\nd to the Very Root of Our Being\n\nOne had to live and work with him to know =\r\nwhat a great teacher he was.\nThrough the trifles of daily life he taught us=\r\n Vedanta in theory and\npractice. He led us with absolute wisdom and infinit=\r\ne kindness and we were\nchanged to the very root of our being, not even know=\r\ning the depth and scope\nof his influence.\n\nIt is only now, after so many ye=\r\nars, that we can see the meaning of the\norders, prohibitions, scoldings and=\r\n storms that we had to endure.\n\nAt that time we understood so little and ju=\r\nst obeyed, because we felt that\nhe was God.\n\nEven that feeling we owed to h=\r\nis grace, for from time to time he would let\nus see him as he really was, t=\r\nhe Lord Almighty, and not the human frame to\nwhich we were accustomed.\n\nWe =\r\nwere women, simple and uneducated. It was our love for him, a reflection\nof=\r\n his love, that chained us to his feet and made us stay. For him we gave\nup=\r\n hearth and home and all our earthly ties.\n\nWe only knew that we were safe =\r\nwith him, that in some miraculous way he\nwould take us to our goal.\n\nHe him=\r\nself was our goal, our real home. More than that we did not know or\ncare. W=\r\ne were even slow to learn the lesson of equality to man and beast\nwhich he =\r\nwas so anxious to teach us first.\n\nTo us he alone existed. The radiant form=\r\n of Ramana was enough for us.\n\nWe did not know that it was not enough, that=\r\n a human soul must learn to\nembrace the universe and realize its own presen=\r\nce in every living being.\n\nWe would concentrate too much on him and resent =\r\nhis compelling us to enlarge\nour little circle. His sometimes harsh treatme=\r\nnt would bewilder us and make\nus cry.\n\nNow we see that it was love that suf=\r\nfered as it laboured.\n\nYogis control themselves severely for long to reach =\r\nthe state to which\nBhagavan would take us by making us work near him in the=\r\n kitchen.\n\nThe small tasks of daily life he would make into avenues to ligh=\r\nt and bliss.\n\nWhoever has not experienced the ecstasy of grinding, the rapt=\r\nure of cooking,\nthe joy of serving iddlies to devotees, his devotees, the s=\r\ntate when the\nmind is in the heart and the heart is in him and he is in the=\r\n work, does not\nknow how much bliss a human heart contains.\n\nAlthough physi=\r\ncally he is no more with us, he still directs us, as in the\npast. He will n=\r\not let go his hold on us until we reach the Other Shore. This\nis our unshak=\r\nen faith.\n\nWe may not always be conscious of his guidance, but we are safe =\r\nin his\nhands. Sri Krishna, in His mercy became a cowherd to teach simple mi=\r\nlkmaids\nthe way to salvation.\n\nSimilarly Bhagavan, the same supreme Being i=\r\nn another form, took to cooking\nin order to save a few ignorant women.\n\nWit=\r\nh his eyes he served his devotees the food of the spirit, with his hands\n- =\r\nthe bread of life.\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =\r\n=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=\r\n=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000325562b7ad313d7047abef479\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Varanasi Subbalakshmi rendered =\r\nuseful service in the Ashrama kitchen during the lifetime of Sri Bhagavan.&lt;=\r\n/span&gt;=C2=A0Her chosen God was Lord Viswanath of Benares. However, when she=\r\n was going to Benares for good she had a dream in which Lord Viswanath told=\r\n her to return to Arunachala, saying that Bhagavan Ramana was the embodimen=\r\nt of Rama,Krishna, Siva and all other Gods.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I LOST MY HUSBAND =\r\nwhen I was sixteen. I went back to my mother&#39;s house and lived there as=\r\n a widow should, trying to pray to and meditate on God. My mother&#39;s min=\r\nd too was devoted to the spiritual quest and religion was the main thing in=\r\n her life.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Once we went on a pilgrimage to Kaveri Pushkaram and on=\r\n our way back we stopped at Arunachala.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There we were told that a yo=\r\nung Brahmin saint had been living on the hill for the past ten years.&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;The next morning we went up the hill along with others with whom we were =\r\ntravelling. At Mulaipal Tirtha we cooked our food, ate and had some rest. T=\r\nhen we went further and found the young Swami near Virupaksha Cave. There w=\r\nas a brick platform at the entrance of the cave and he was sitting on it.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;As soon as I saw him, I was at once convinced that God Arunachala H=\r\nimself had come in human form to give salvation to all who approached Him.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;He was about thirty at the time, and wonderful to look at; he was br=\r\night and shining like burnished gold, his eyes were blooming and clear, lik=\r\ne the petals of a lotus. He looked at us for a long time.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The peak=\r\n of Arunachala was towering over our heads, the huge towers of the temple w=\r\nere below and an immense silence surrounded the Swami.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Then the ladies started whispering. One wanted to pra=\r\ny for a child for her daughter-in-law who was barren, but another was sayin=\r\ng that the Swami was too exalted for such worldly matters. Finally the Swam=\r\ni was told of the young wife&#39;s sorrow. He smiled and lifted his folded =\r\nhands to the sky as if saying : &quot;All happens by the will of the Almigh=\r\nty.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;We returned to Nellore and the impression of that=\r\n visit faded away. I did not even dream at that time that my life would be =\r\nspent at the feet of the Swami.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I was thirty-one I went to Rame=\r\nshwaram on a pilgrimage and on my return journey I stopped at Tiruvannamala=\r\ni. I learned that the Swami was then living at the foot of the hill. That a=\r\nfternoon we went to see him at his Ashrama. There was a thatched shed over =\r\nhis mother&#39;s samadhi and a tiled hall for meeting the Swami. He was sea=\r\nted on a couch and about a dozen devotees were on the bare floor. We sat in=\r\n silence for ten minutes and returned to the town.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan&#39;s =\r\npresence gave me the experience of inner silence and mental stillness, but =\r\naway from him I could not regain it and I spent a year vainly trying to fre=\r\ne myself from all thought. Some friends were going to see Sri Aurobindo&#39=\r\n;s Ashrama at Pondicherry and they took me along. They were to stay there f=\r\nor a week. I was not much impressed and went for a short visit to Ramanasra=\r\nmam.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;A learned Shastri whom I knew appeared in my dream and asked =\r\nme: &quot;Where was the need for you to go to Pondicherry? Entrust yourself=\r\n to Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. He is God Himself. He will surely lead yo=\r\nu to salvation.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;But even such a clear dream was not enough. =\r\nI cherished a plan of going to Benares and spending my life there in holy a=\r\nusterities. I decided to go to Bhagavan, learn from him how to meditate, an=\r\nd then leave for Benares for good. My friend Parvatamma decided to join me =\r\nin the spiritual adventure. Accordingly we went to Tiruvannamalai and rente=\r\nd a house. In the afternoon we took cashew nuts and sugar candy as an offer=\r\ning to Bhagavan and went to the Ashrama. We placed our offerings on a stool=\r\n before him and sat down. The cow Lakshmi happened to be lying near Bhagava=\r\nn&#39;s sofa. She got up and began to chew our precious offerings. Bhagavan=\r\n looked on and said nothing. His attendant, Madhava Swami, did not even loo=\r\nk. We thought it might be impious to disturb the cow, but soon I got exaspe=\r\nrated and exclaimed, &quot;Please remove the cow !&quot; Madhava Swami repl=\r\nied: &quot;Why? I thought you offered those sweets to Lakshmi !&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;What is Atma?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next d=\r\nay at noon I was again at Ramanasramam. His midday meal over, Bhagavan was =\r\nreclining on the sofa and explaining a verse from the Bhagavad Gita to Sri =\r\nRamiah Yogi. As no one else was in the hall, I gathered courage and asked: =\r\n&quot;What is Atma?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Is it the limitless ether of space or the awar=\r\neness that cognizes everything?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan replied:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;&quot;To remain without thinking &#39;this is A=\r\ntma&#39; and &#39;that is Atma&#39;, is itself Atma.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nHe looked at me and I felt my mind melt away into nothing. No thought would=\r\n come, only the feeling of immense, unutterable peace. My doubts were clear=\r\ned.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Every day I would visit Bhagavan and listen to his talks with th=\r\ne devotees. Deep in my mind there was the same rock-like stillness, immense=\r\nly solid and yet strangely vibrant.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Several times I was invited to=\r\n work in the Ashrama, but the Ashrama ways were not orthodox enough for me.=\r\n One day Bhagavan&#39;s own sister asked me to take her place in the Ashram=\r\na, for she had to leave for some time. I could not refuse. At that time San=\r\ntammal was the chief cook and my duty was to help her. To my great joy Bhag=\r\navan was in the kitchen with us most of the time. He taught me to cook tast=\r\nily and neatly.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I would spend all day in the Ashrama and in the ev=\r\nening I would go to the town to sleep, for there was no sleeping accommodat=\r\nion for women in the Ashrama.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Once Bhagavan said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;You w=\r\nidows do not eat vegetables like drumsticks and radish. Diet restrictions a=\r\nre good to strengthen the will.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Besides, the quality of food and t=\r\nhe manner of eating have an influence on the mind.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I was very =\r\nhappy to work in the kitchen directly under Bhagavan&#39;s supervision; yet=\r\n I wanted to go home. The Ashrama ways were too unorthodox for me. And ther=\r\ne was too much work. I did not want to work all day long. I wanted to sit q=\r\nuietly and meditate in solitude.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;=\r\n&gt;I Leave the Ashram&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;So I left again for my village and I went=\r\n away for about a year. I divided my time between idleness and meditation. =\r\nYet my heart was at the Ashrama. I would tell myself: &quot;Where is the ne=\r\ned of running about. Is not Bhagavan here and everywhere?&quot; But my hear=\r\nt was calling me to Bhagavan. Even when I was pleading with myself, that in=\r\n the Ashrama there would be no time for meditation, my heart would say: &qu=\r\not;Working in the kitchen by his side is far better than meditation.&quot; =\r\nAt home I had all the leisure I wanted, but it seemed to me that I was wast=\r\ning my time.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Later I learned that that was the time Bhagavan used =\r\nto remember me very often. Once they were preparing pongal (pulse with rice=\r\n and black pepper) to celebrate Bhagavan&#39;s monthly birth-star (Punarvas=\r\nu) and Bhagavan told Santammal:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;Subbalakshmi is far away yet=\r\n she worries whether pongal is cooked here today or not.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;On so=\r\nme other festival day Bhagavan announced:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Subbalakshmi will tu=\r\nrn up; keep some pongal for her.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;That very day I arrived at =\r\nthe Ashrama.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;His great love for me, a worthless devotee, bound me fi=\r\nrmly to his feet. Again and again I wanted to leave the Ashrama, but he hel=\r\nd me for my good, more powerfully than I held on to him.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Whenever =\r\nI was collecting courage to tell Bhagavan about my desire to leave, he woul=\r\nd seem to read my thoughts and forestall me by giving me something special =\r\nto do. I felt I had too much to do and that my life was being wasted. One d=\r\nay Bhagavan was looking at me intently and said:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;It looks as=\r\n if you are still hankering after meditation.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;I replied: &quot;What have I got except endless work in th=\r\ne kitchen?&quot; Bhagavan said with deep feeling:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;Your hands=\r\n may do the work but your mind can remain still.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are that=\r\n which never move Realize that and you will find that work is not a strain.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But as long as you think that you are the body and that the work is=\r\n done by you,you will feel your life to be an endless toil.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;In fac=\r\nt, it is the mind that toils, not the body.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weig=\r\nht:bold&quot;&gt;Even if your body keeps quiet, will your mind keep quiet too?&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Even in sleep the mind is busy with its dreams.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I =\r\nreplied: &quot;Yes, Swami, it is as natural for you to know that you are no=\r\nt your body as it is for us to think that we are the body. I had a dream re=\r\ncently in which you were explaining this very point. I was dreaming that I =\r\nwas working in the kitchen and you were having your bath in your usual plac=\r\ne behind the bamboo mat partition.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;You asked:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;Who is i=\r\nt?&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I replied: &#39;Who shall I say I am?&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You said:&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;Exactly so, you are nothing of which something can be said.&#39=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now, just remember that was my dream and it was quite clear. Why c=\r\nan&#39;t I remember always that I am not the body?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;Bec=\r\nause you haven&#39;t had enough of it,&quot; he smiled.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Do Not Torture The Body&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I used to fa=\r\nst quite often, as advised in some scriptural texts. In one of the books, I=\r\n read: &quot;He who wants to know himself and yet pays attention to his bod=\r\ny is like a man who trusts a crocodile to take him across a river.&quot;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I showed the text to Bhagavan and he explained:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;It does=\r\n not mean that you should starve.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You need not torture the body.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;It only means not giving the body more than it needs.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;With your mind, hold on to enquiry and just keep the=\r\n body going so that it does not become a hindrance.For this, pure and fresh=\r\n food,simply prepared and taken in moderation,is a great help.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Another day I asked Bhagavan&#39;s permission to put on the sanny=\r\nasin&#39;s orange robes and beg for my food. He said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;&quot;Will coloured clothes give you renunciation?&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;First learn what sannyasa means=\r\n.&quot;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Once five or six dev=\r\notees sat down before Bhagavan and sang a hymn in praise of the Guru. He go=\r\nt up in the middle of the recitation and went away, saying:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;=\r\nPrayers and praises will not take one far.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is the merciful=\r\n look of the teacher that bestows true knowledge.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I felt elate=\r\nd. Had I not received his merciful glances? But the next day he was saying:=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;Unless one becomes a six month old baby there is no hope fo=\r\nr him in the realm of self-knowledge.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My heart sank. Although =\r\nI lived in the presence of Lord Arunachala Himself, I was far from becoming=\r\n an infant.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Why Should You Doubt=\r\n?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Another time Bhagavan was telling us stories from the lives=\r\n of devotees of bygone ages. I questioned him: &quot;It is written that God=\r\n appeared before the devotee and shed His grace on him while he was still i=\r\nn his mother&#39;s womb. Can it be true?&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;To that Bhagavan re=\r\nplied:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Why should you doubt? Will doubt profit you?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Onl=\r\ny your devotion will suffer.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Those stories are as real as your telli=\r\nng me that you are present here and now.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan was one da=\r\ny reading and explaining Tirupugazh in Tamil to Alamelammal of Madura.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;I did not know Tamil and I could only look on. I saw a change in Bhagava=\r\nn. A light was shining from within him. His face was radiant, his smile was=\r\n beaming, his eyes were full of compassion. His words reverberated in the m=\r\nind and were instantly and deeply understood.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;All my being was car=\r\nried upwards on a current of strange vibrations. The memory of this experie=\r\nnce is ever present in my heart.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A great joy has remained with me th=\r\nat I was privileged to sit at the feet of the Divine Being.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;It was=\r\n ever like this with him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whoever went to him, he would go down to h=\r\nis level; his words and gestures, even the intonation of his voice, would a=\r\ndapt themselves to the make-up of the people around him. With children he w=\r\nas their playmate, to family people - a wise counsellor, to pundits - a wel=\r\nl of knowledge, to yogis - the God of will, the God of victory. He saw hims=\r\nelf in them and they saw themselves in him and their hearts would be bound =\r\nto his feet in everlasting love.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;All who came to see him would be =\r\ncharmed by his love and kindness, beauty and wisdom, and the overwhelming s=\r\nense of unity he radiated like fire radiating heat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;To some he would=\r\n grant a special vision, invisible to others; with some he would openly dis=\r\ncourse.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Crowds would gather round him and each one would see him d=\r\nifferently. Even his pictures differ. A stranger would not guess that they =\r\nare all of the same person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Grant =\r\nMe Salvation, Swami&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;One afternoon a lady from Kumbhakonam s=\r\nat near Bhagavan and exclaimed: &quot;How glad I am that I have met you, Sw=\r\nami. I have craved to see you for a long time, Swami. Not that I want anyth=\r\ning, Swami. Only please be kind and grant me salvation, Swami.&quot; With t=\r\nhat she got up and went away.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan had a hearty laugh.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&quot;Look at her - all she wants is salvation.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Give her salvation, =\r\nshe wants nothing else.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I said: &quot;Is it not what we all wa=\r\nnt?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He replied:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;Is salvation something to be ha=\r\nnded over on request?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do I keep bundles of salvation concealed about=\r\n me, that people should ask me for salvation?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;She said &#39;I do not=\r\n want anything.&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If it is sincere, that itself is salvation.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;What is there I can give and what is there they can take?&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;Somebody brought a bell to be rung at the arati ceremony and it was put i=\r\nnto Bhagavan&#39;s hands. He tried its sound in various ways and laughed:&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;God wants us to make a fire of our past evil deeds and burn o=\r\nur karma in it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;But these people burn a copper worth of camphor and =\r\nhope to please the Almighty.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Do they really believe that they can ge=\r\nt something for nothing?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;They do not want to bend to God,they want=\r\n God to bend to them.In their greed they would swallow God,but they would n=\r\not let him swallow them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some boast of their offerings.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What =\r\nhave they got to offer ?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The idol of Vinayaka (Ganesha) is made of=\r\n jaggery.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;They break off a piece of it and offer it to Him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The only offering worthy of the Lord Is to =\r\nclear the mind of thoughts and remain steady in the peace of Self.&quot;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;In the early days, when I jo=\r\nined the Ashrama, Bhagavan used to help in grinding lentils, peeling vegeta=\r\nbles and even lending a hand in cooking. He would get up long before daybre=\r\nak to join the kitchen staff at their work. We ladies would arrive by sunri=\r\nse, and Bhagavan would see that all was ready for our arrival and we would =\r\noften find a part of our work already done.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;To forestall him we wo=\r\nuld come by five; he would come at four; we would come then at three. When =\r\nhe saw that we were left without sleep, he stopped entering the kitchen bef=\r\nore sunrise and gave us time to sleep.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;He was the very embo=\r\ndiment of wisdom and kindness, though he did not mind our faults and mistak=\r\nes,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He made us follow his instructions to the letter.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We had =\r\nto do the same task again and again until it was done to his complete satis=\r\nfaction. Did he do it for himself? Of what use was it to him?&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;He w=\r\nanted to prove to us that we could do things right,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;that only lack o=\r\nf patience and attention causes all the mess.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He sometimes seemed to=\r\no severe, even harsh, to make us do something correctly, for he knew what w=\r\ne did not know that we can act correctly if we only try.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;With expe=\r\nrience came confidence, and with confidence the great peace of righteousnes=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In daily life he avoided all distinction. At work and at food he =\r\nwas one of us. But in the hall, seated on the sofa, he was the great Lord o=\r\nf Kailas, the Holy Mountain.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Whenever Bhagavan would enter or leav=\r\ne the hall, we would all get up respectfully. One could see that he did not=\r\n like so many people being disturbed because of him.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He wanted us to=\r\n learn well the lesson that God is present in every being in all his glory =\r\nand fullness and must be given equal reverence. He was tireless in hammerin=\r\ng this lesson into our minds and hearts, and he would ruthlessly sacrifice =\r\nthe little comforts we so loved to provide for him, as soon as he noticed a=\r\n trace of preference.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The law that what cannot be shared must not =\r\nbe touched was supreme in his way of dealing with us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Separative and=\r\n exclusive feelings are the cause of the &quot;I&quot; and therefore the gr=\r\neatest obstacles in the realization of the One. No wonder he was exterminat=\r\ning them so relentlessly.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Once B=\r\nhagavan had jaundice. He had to be put on a fruit diet, but he would not ea=\r\nt fruit unless all ate, and in equal quantities too! Where could we get suc=\r\nh a lot of fruit? Yet he was adamant and would leave his share untouched un=\r\nless he saw an equal share on everybody&#39;s leaf-plate.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Those wh=\r\no say that a sick man needs special food and must not give trouble, miss th=\r\ne point. Bhagavan was not sick. His body had jaundice, that was all.=C2=A0&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;He wanted to impress on our minds that unde=\r\nr no condition must a man have a greater share.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0Our learning th=\r\nis lesson was more important to him than the cure of his jaundice.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;To serve him at mealtimes was by i=\r\ntself a dangerous adventure.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Our womanly desire was to fill h=\r\nim to the brim. His rule was to clear the plate no matter what or how much =\r\nwas served. Not a speck of food would be left uneaten.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;So we had to be watchful and serve much less than wha=\r\nt we would like to. It was not easy and we would often fail. He would scold=\r\n us bitterly, or, what was infinitely worse, would fall ill and suffer.&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;I cannot understand how he managed to produce an illness when =\r\na lesson was needed, but our life with him was crisis after crisis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nHe would take any amount of trouble to teach us the virtues necessary for s=\r\nelf-discovery. Our life in the Ashrama was a school of yoga, and a hard sch=\r\nool too. For book-knowledge was as nothing to him; only character and genui=\r\nne spiritual experience counted.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;With time he ceased working in th=\r\ne kitchen, but we could still find him in the dining hall. When all would l=\r\neave after food, he would linger on his seat and we would collect around hi=\r\nm and chat and listen to his precious words. He would teach us and guide us=\r\n and we would forget the years that passed and be again the happy crowd of =\r\nyore.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Changed to the Very Root of Our Being&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One had to live=\r\n and work with him to know what a great teacher he was. Through the trifles=\r\n of daily life he taught us Vedanta in theory and practice. He led us with =\r\nabsolute wisdom and infinite kindness and we were changed to the very root =\r\nof our being, not even knowing the depth and scope of his influence.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;It is only now, after so many years, that we can see the meaning of the =\r\norders, prohibitions, scoldings and storms that we had to endure.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;At=\r\n that time we understood so little and just obeyed, because we felt that he=\r\n was God.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Even that feeling we owed to his grace, for from time to=\r\n time he would let us see him as he really was, the Lord Almighty, and not =\r\nthe human frame to which we were accustomed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We were women, simple a=\r\nnd uneducated. It was our love for him, a reflection of his love, that chai=\r\nned us to his feet and made us stay. For him we gave up hearth and home and=\r\n all our earthly ties.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;We only knew that we were safe with him, th=\r\nat in some miraculous way he would take us to our goal.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;He himself w=\r\nas our goal, our real home. More than that we did not know or care. We were=\r\n even slow to learn the lesson of equality to man and beast which he was so=\r\n anxious to teach us first.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;To us he alone existed. The radiant fo=\r\nrm of Ramana was enough for us.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We did not know that it was not enou=\r\ngh, that a human soul must learn to embrace the universe and realize its ow=\r\nn presence in every living being.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;We would concentrate too much on=\r\n him and resent his compelling us to enlarge our little circle. His sometim=\r\nes harsh treatment would bewilder us and make us cry.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Now we see tha=\r\nt it was love that suffered as it laboured.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Yogis control themselv=\r\nes severely for long to reach the state to which Bhagavan would take us by =\r\nmaking us work near him in the kitchen.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The small tasks of daily lif=\r\ne he would make into avenues to light and bliss.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Whoever has not e=\r\nxperienced the ecstasy of grinding, the rapture of cooking, the joy of serv=\r\ning iddlies to devotees, his devotees, the state when the mind is in the he=\r\nart and the heart is in him and he is in the work, does not know how much b=\r\nliss a human heart contains.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Although physically he is no more wit=\r\nh us, he still directs us, as in the past. He will not let go his hold on u=\r\ns until we reach the Other Shore. This is our unshaken faith.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We may=\r\n not always be conscious of his guidance, but we are safe in his hands. Sri=\r\n Krishna, in His mercy became a cowherd to teach simple milkmaids the way t=\r\no salvation.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Similarly Bhagavan, the same supreme Being in another=\r\n form, took to cooking in order to save a few ignorant women.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;With h=\r\nis eyes he served his devotees the food of the spirit, with his hands - the=\r\n bread of life.&lt;div style=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;mar=\r\ngin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;m=\r\nargin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- =\r\n&lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=\r\n=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=\r\n=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000325562b7ad313d7047abef479--\r\n\n"}}
