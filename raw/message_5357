Please point out m=\r\ny mistakes I will make in this process.\n\nWe are trying to discuss three poi=\r\nnts here\n\n1) Choosing a dietary habit\n2) Dependence of Human population on =\r\nNon-veg sources of nutrition\n3) bioavailability or BV of Non veg vs Veg foo=\r\nd.\n\nI commented on two points \n\n1) Choosing a dietary habit \n2) Dependence =\r\nof Human population on non veg sources of nutrition\n\n1) Choosing a Dietary =\r\nhabit\n\nOne should choose his dietary habit based on his varna (aptitude and=\r\n attitude) and goal in his life. He should not bother what the BV or other =\r\nfactor or research says. For an athlete, Eggs are important part of his tra=\r\nining. and for a person seeking spirituality one should stick to vegetarian=\r\n food unless he is able to rise above the difference in veg and nonveg. I a=\r\ngree with Narasimha Ji about this point.\n\nIn some diseases Non veg sources =\r\nplay an very important role (Although not a necessasity) like in Albumin de=\r\nficiency two eggs per day can save a person from costly (3000Rs per Inj) Al=\r\nbumin Injections. In TB, Soup made of goat meat do wonders. Ayurveda also r=\r\necommend it strongly Charak Samhita) etc.\n\n2) Dependence of Human populatio=\r\nn on non veg sources of nutrition\n\nI agree with the link provided in this d=\r\niscussions. Books and articles by Peta members are far more convincing for =\r\nswitching to Veg sources. I can also provide tens of links and book referen=\r\nce which oppose their view. Honestly, I do not believe each and every infor=\r\nmation on net and not every book written about nutirtion, just like astrolo=\r\ngy. Let us leave this debate aside and look at other aspect of it.\n\nBy &#39;Pra=\r\nctically impossible&#39; I meant the cost factor and demand/supply factor. In I=\r\nndia (Leave other high Nonveg consuming countries alone) about 45% people a=\r\nre Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Proteins are supplied by Non veg =\r\nsources. Currently, Important veg sourcesof proteins are Legumes (including=\r\n gram soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 80 -120 Rs per Kg), Nuts (includ=\r\ne almonds cashew etc - Costs needn&#39;t mention), Dairy products (Milk being 3=\r\n0-40 Rs per Kg), Grains (cheapest sources but not a very complete source), =\r\n\n\nIn last two years, their demand rose by 15-20 % but their price rose by 4=\r\n0-60%. even at current price, 60 % of population can not afford a complete =\r\nbalanced diet as recommended by Experts which include 250 Ml of milk, 50-70=\r\n gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 150 gms of fruits per person, along =\r\nwith grains and roughage etc (These are approx minimum quantities. Differen=\r\nt sources may quote different quantities). There is average family size of =\r\n5 and average family income is 200 Rs per day! And nutrition is not the onl=\r\ny thing needed in our life!!! Lot of other expenditures are there\n\nEven at =\r\ncurrent prices, 60% population can not afford balanced diet. If additional =\r\n40% is included in demand of veg sources, price may rise another 100% and I=\r\n need not to explain what will happen at that time.\n\nSir, I am not advocati=\r\nng Non-veg food here. I am also a strict vegetarian, even for milk I prefer=\r\n a source where there is minimum cruelity (Yes you can not expect no crueli=\r\nty even for milk if you buy it from market and do not produce it yourself)\n=\r\n\nAgain, I think and believe that practically it is impossible to shift all =\r\nthe population to veg sources especially when the agriculture land is decre=\r\nasing day by day because of many reasons)\n\n3) Bioavailability or BV of diff=\r\nerent sources\n\nIt is always a questionable point. because again sections su=\r\npporting vegetarian diet will highlight the results which support veg food =\r\nand vice versa. There are lot of  halfbaked researches. but if we think sci=\r\nentifically we will find that for different sources different sources are b=\r\netter. For example calcium animal sources are best (Including milk), for al=\r\nbumin Egg is best, for Vit C veg sources are best, for proteins animal sour=\r\nces are best (Ayurveda also support this) So I think we can not say that on=\r\nly veg or non veg will suffice the diet. Obviously humans can not survive o=\r\nn Nonveg food alone. As far as BV is concerned I agree with the values give=\r\nn by Rajarshi ji.\n\nYes, I agree Non veg food increases tamas in mind. But s=\r\no does the deep fried vegetarian food, although less but in daily habit it =\r\nwill not let you escape from Tamas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more =\r\nenergy is used in digesting food, less energy is available for brain. it is=\r\n a scietific fact that after food, significant blood supply is directed to =\r\nintestines. How much Rajas Spicy food, tea, coffee, coke and Red bull is in=\r\ncreasing in us? We are what we eat! This is true. So one should eat what on=\r\ne want to become.\n\nBut still at last, I want to mention that I am not advoc=\r\nating Non-veg food. I am just highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetar=\r\nian too. We should understand that we may be right but we should realise th=\r\nat it does not necessarily mean other person is not right.\n\nPlease point ou=\r\nt my mistakes I had made in this post. I agree that some values i mentioned=\r\n here may not be exactly as quoted by sources. But they are approximate and=\r\n not too much off the line.\n\nKind Regards\nAtul\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha,=\r\n\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I disgree with two points you mentioned.

In my other mail, I have \n&gt; qoted from a c=\r\nouple of research papers and books on clinical nutrition and \n&gt; dietetics, =\r\nand if you ask, I can provide more; which may=C2=A0take a few days since I =\r\n\n&gt; have to get them from people who deal with these topics professionally, =\r\nbut time \n&gt; is not a problem.=C2=A0All the papers are=C2=A0from the most ac=\r\ncepted and reputed \n&gt; scientific=C2=A0journals. There is no confusion. Whic=\r\nh is why I said, it is myth \n&gt; that=C2=A0vegeterian=C2=A0foods are=C2=A0eas=\r\nier to digest, if digestibility is the criteria. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Further, in=\r\n my experience, I never found traditional vegeterians to be any more \n&gt; dul=\r\nl or smarter than traditional omnivores. \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; (7) Regarding Priya=\r\n&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and their needs. \n&gt; If an anim=\r\nal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Otherwise, feed the poor \n&gt; fellow=\r\n whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; An animal has a specific physical=C2=A0s=\r\ntructure and needs to maintain the same. But \n&gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust=\r\n&#39; to any kind of meals. I have seen people feeding \n&gt; vegeterian diets to d=\r\nogs. Statistically speaking, an animal whose whole body \n&gt; structure is des=\r\nigned to be a carnivore, may adjust to any food for the sake of \n&gt; survival=\r\n, but will become internally weak and susceptable to disease and \n&gt; weaknes=\r\nses. Who takes the karma for the disease and weakness that may result \n&gt; fr=\r\nom an unnatural diet to an animal? \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Not that all dogs who are=\r\n feed a veg diet end up being diseased, but the chances \n&gt; increase a lot. =\r\nIt is like not all smokers die of cancer, but smoking makes one \n&gt; suscepti=\r\nble to cancer. It increases the probability. Therefore my personal \n&gt; opini=\r\non is that an animal if kept at home, it should taken care of in the best \n=\r\n&gt; way possible, providing it with whatever maybe needed, including the righ=\r\nt diet.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; _______________\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; A question =\r\nfor you.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Scientists studying evolution and human body structures=\r\n have concluded that meat \n&gt; eating along with cropping and fruits has been=\r\n prevelant since at least 4 \n&gt; million years. That, without a diet which wa=\r\ns omnivorous, the structure of the \n&gt; human stomach (lack of a developed=C2=\r\n=A0caecum),=C2=A0and the threefold increase in=C2=A0brain \n&gt; size (from arc=\r\nheological evidences)=C2=A0could never have been what it is today. \n&gt; Which=\r\n means, an omnivorous diet has been a=C2=A0natural process, so ingrained th=\r\nat it \n&gt; has changed the very structure of the human body. This cannot be d=\r\none \n&gt; consciously, but only by the work of natural forces.

A few quick comments.\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) We are we we eat. Production of various =\r\nchemicals in our body and their \n&gt; interactions, are controlled by what we =\r\neat. Thus, what we eat has a profound \n&gt; impact on us.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) Much has be=\r\nen written on the material benefits from vegetarianism. But that \n&gt; is not =\r\nall. There are spiritual and subtle reasons as well.\n&gt; \n&gt; Eating the flesh =\r\nor body parts of an animal that strongly identifies with the \n&gt; physical bo=\r\ndy entails a karma. Self-identification of plants with their physical \n&gt; bo=\r\ndy is much subtler and the karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is mu=\r\nch \n&gt; smaller.\n&gt; \n&gt; Especially these days, very cruel methods are used for =\r\nmeat production by \n&gt; corporations and animals are treated very cruelly. Pa=\r\nrt of the karma for their \n&gt; suffering goes to the ones benefiting from the=\r\nir meat.\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Pu=\r\nblic Radio) several \n&gt; months back. They conducted an experiment on gorilla=\r\ns. One set of gorillas was \n&gt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nut=\r\ns, fruits etc. After several \n&gt; months, researchers found a gap in the inte=\r\nlligence of the two sets. The ones \n&gt; fed with meat were duller.\n&gt; \n&gt; Their=\r\n theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with =\r\n\n&gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the development of=\r\n brain. \n&gt; Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to human bei=\r\nngs or not, a \n&gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s intell=\r\nectual development.\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may feel dull or=\r\n sleepy and cannot focus well \n&gt; on work that requires alertness and skill.=\r\n That is because the digestive process \n&gt; is using up a lot of energy (also=\r\n known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much \n&gt; agni available for other ac=\r\ntivities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that \n&gt; happens in the min=\r\nd. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences also \n&gt; requires agn=\r\ni and that cannot happen well. That is why meditation or homam after \n&gt; a h=\r\neavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised to do sadhana before \n&gt;=\r\n eating.\n&gt; \n&gt; (5) If foods that light up a higher digestive agni (e.g. meat=\r\ns, deep fried food \n&gt; with more oil, spicy foods that stimulate digestive a=\r\ngni etc) are consumed more \n&gt; frequently, agni is diverted towards digestio=\r\nn more often and there is less agni \n&gt; available for assimilaring intellect=\r\nual and spiritual ideas and experiences. If \n&gt; one eats saattwik food that =\r\nis very easy to digest (simple grains, simple \n&gt; lentils and simple vegetab=\r\nles, all softly cooked with mild spices, and fruits), \n&gt; less agni is diver=\r\nted towards digestion and more agni is available for \n&gt; assimilaring intell=\r\nectual and spiritual ideas and experiences.\n&gt; \n&gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot=\r\n burn wet grass well. But huge stacks of dry grass may \n&gt; be burnt by just =\r\none spark! Similarly, little bit of internal fire may be enough \n&gt; to assim=\r\nilate spiritual ideas and experiences in a person with excellent \n&gt; vaasana=\r\ns and few obstructions (dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed \n&gt;=\r\n in a person with poor vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it=\r\n all \n&gt; depends on vaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.\n&gt; \n&gt; One p=\r\nerson may eat meat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting \n=\r\n&gt; them and yet make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat sa=\r\nattwik \n&gt; food, maximize the agni available for spiritual transformation an=\r\nd yet struggle \n&gt; to progress spiritually. However, the best course of acti=\r\non for one is to ignore \n&gt; counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other =\r\nthings being equal, that \n&gt; maximizes the agni available for spiritual prog=\r\nress.\n&gt; \n&gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas =\r\nand their needs. \n&gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Othe=\r\nrwise, feed the poor \n&gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; \n&gt; (8) One should e=\r\nat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough \n&gt; food to sus=\r\ntain oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material \n&gt; world u=\r\nsing physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too much food is \n&gt; =\r\nnot good for spiritual sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead of overeating most of the time=\r\n and fasting on specific days, it is \n&gt; better to eat limited amount always=\r\n. Regular practices are more important for \n&gt; transformation and success, t=\r\nhan occasional practices.\n&gt; \n&gt; (9) By merely thinking that god is the doer =\r\nof all actions or considering food \n&gt; to be god&#39;s prasad, one cannot escape=\r\n the karma involved. It depends on how \n&gt; deeply ingrained that thought is =\r\nand how deeply one feels so. If one internally \n&gt; feels 100% that god is ac=\r\nting through one and whatever one is doing (e.g. \n&gt; eating) is just god&#39;s p=\r\nrasad to one, then one is free.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------=\r\n------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, F=\r\nree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals fo=\r\nr short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films t=\r\nhat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; Spirituality: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
