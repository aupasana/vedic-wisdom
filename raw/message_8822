I love that story.... :) \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, h ramalingam &lt;hramalingam@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namo Ramana\n&gt; here i re=\r\nmember an old story. One day Bhagavan Narada Maharshi went to Lord\n&gt; Naraya=\r\nna and told him that he was the only one who remembers his name all\n&gt; the t=\r\nime as he used to chant his name without stop. So Narayana told him\n&gt; that =\r\nif it was true that Narada remembers him all the time then Narada\n&gt; should =\r\ngo around the world with a cup full of oil once without spilling\n&gt; even a d=\r\nrop on the ground. Narada accepted the challenge and went round the\n&gt; world=\r\n without spilling the oil and approched Lord Narayana and told him\n&gt; that h=\r\ne had accomplished the task and so he proved that he was the true\n&gt; devotee=\r\n etc. Lord Narayan asked him that how many times he chanted Lord&#39;s\n&gt; name d=\r\nuring the course and then only it struck to Narada that not once he\n&gt; could=\r\n chant HIS name during the round trip and his concentration was on oil\n&gt; on=\r\nly. Then Lord Narayana showed him one business man who wakes up early in\n&gt; =\r\nthe morning and chant HIS name thrice before starting his daily routine and=\r\n\n&gt; before going to bed he chants HIS name thrice daily. Not a single day th=\r\ne\n&gt; businees man forgot this task and Narada and Lord watched this for many=\r\n\n&gt; days and months. Then Lord tolsd Narada that the business man with his s=\r\no\n&gt; much ordeal remembers HIM twice daily at a particular moment and that i=\r\ns\n&gt; the greatest Bhakthi of all. So Narada understood the morale of the sto=\r\nry\n&gt; and I believe You also understood the same. &quot;Every time on time&quot;\n&gt; Nam=\r\no Ramana\n&gt; H Ramalingam\n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Nov 3, 2012 at 8:30 PM, sunrise_1080 &lt;=\r\nsunrise_1080@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; **\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; People say remember God all t=\r\nhe time.

It&#39;s very interesting.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.speakingtree.i=\r\nn/spiritual-blogs/seekers/meditation/how-to-remember-god-at-all-times\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; The author, Sadhak Gaurav, says:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;While doing duties, one is sup=\r\nposed to remember God. There can be three\n&gt; &gt; ways to achieve such remembra=\r\nnce:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 1) While remembering God, do the work. (Here remembrance is fo=\r\nremost and\n&gt; &gt; work is secondary.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 2) While doing work, remember Go=\r\nd. (Here work is foremost and remembrance\n&gt; &gt; is secondary.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; 3) Onl=\r\ny do God&#39;s work. (Here exclusive feelings towards God are primary.)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Most of the people try to follow #1 and #2. Some people do minimal amount\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; of duties and make remembrance their prime focus.\n&gt; &gt; Some other people=\r\n try to do their duties and take care of their family and\n&gt; &gt; friends and t=\r\nry to remember God while doing their duties. Most of these\n&gt; &gt; people strug=\r\ngle to remember God and tend to forget him. One obvious reason\n&gt; &gt; is the l=\r\nack of alertness. But they also make very grave mistake. They\n&gt; &gt; accept th=\r\neir body, family, work and business as their own and have feeling\n&gt; &gt; on mi=\r\nne-ness towards it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Therefore, God is forgotten again and again an=\r\nd it is difficult to\n&gt; &gt; remember Him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;If one does only God&#39;s wor=\r\nk, then God will always be remembered. There is\n&gt; &gt; sense of mine-ness towa=\r\nrds God and His work and therefore, remembrance\n&gt; &gt; happens all the time. T=\r\nherefore, one should have a firm resolve to do only\n&gt; &gt; God&#39;s work so that =\r\none can always remember Him.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;What is God&#39;s work? In order to do G=\r\nod&#39;s work, one must accept and\n&gt; &gt; understand the truth. The truth is that =\r\neverything belongs to God. All\n&gt; &gt; living entities are part of God as God i=\r\ns in everyone. All activities done\n&gt; &gt; are God&#39;s work as God is everyone.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I thought he explained the technique brilliantly. God bless him! It=\r\n&#39;s easy\n&gt; &gt; to say &quot;remember God&quot;, but it&#39;s much more helpful when someone =\r\ngives\n&gt; &gt; PRACTICAL advice on how to!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; How does one remember God all=\r\n day? While brushing one&#39;s teeth? While\n&gt; &gt; driving? While at work? When so=\r\nmeone&#39;s yelling at one? When someone&#39;s being\n&gt; &gt; nice to one?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sivan=\r\nanda said, No need to run away to the forest if you&#39;re a busy\n&gt; &gt; man/woman=\r\n of the world. You can attain God in and through the world. Every\n&gt; &gt; hour,=\r\n spend 2 minutes contemplating God.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Every hour, on the hour&quot; (like the=\r\n BBC world news slogan!), contemplate\n&gt; &gt; God and say the Name...Over time,=\r\n this builds up a huge spiritual force\n&gt; &gt; that will transform you...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Here&#39;s Sivananda&#39;s article on God rememberance for working\n&gt; &gt; people/ho=\r\nuseholders...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; http://www.energyenhancement.org/sivananda/Sri-Sw=\r\nami-Sivananda-The-Path-Beyond-Sorrow-Chapter-9-Yoga-In-The-Home-7-Dynamic-S=\r\npirituality-Remembering-God.html\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Om Namo Narayanaya\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Aparna\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; -- \n&gt; H.Ramalingam\n&gt; \n&gt; Managing Director\n&gt; \n&gt; Shr=\r\ni Ramana Heavy Engineering Private Limited\n&gt; \n&gt; No.769, 59th Street, 10th S=\r\nector, K.K.nagar\n&gt; \n&gt; Chennai-600078\n&gt; \n&gt; Ph: Off-044-23662346\n&gt; \n&gt; Cell: +=\r\n91-93847 41969\n&gt; \n&gt; +91-99620 31969\n&gt; \n&gt; +91-99406 51969\n&gt; \n&gt; Email: hramal=\r\ningam@...\n&gt; \n&gt; hramalingam@...\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
