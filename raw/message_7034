Establishing yourself in firm\ndispassion, be free of passion and=\r\n happy. 10.3\n\nThe essential nature of bondage is nothing other than desire,=\r\n and its\nelimination is known as liberation. It is simply by not being atta=\r\nched to\nchanging things that the everlasting joy of attainment is reached. =\r\n10.4\n\nYou are one, conscious and pure, while all this is inert non-being.\nI=\r\ngnorance itself is nothing, so what is the point of wanting to understand?\n=\r\n10.5\n\nKingdoms, children, wives, bodies, pleasures -- these have all been l=\r\nost to\nyou life after life, attached to them though you were. 10.6\n\nEnough =\r\nof wealth, sensuality, and good deeds. In the forest of samsara the\nmind ha=\r\ns never found satisfaction in these. 10.7\n\nHow many births have you not don=\r\ne hard and painful labour with body, mind,\nand speech. Now at last, stop! 1=\r\n0.8\n\n\nAshtavakra said:\n\nUnmoved and undistressed, realising that being, non=\r\n-being and change are of\nthe very nature of things, one easily finds peace.=\r\n 11.1\n\nAt peace, having shed all desires within, and realising that nothing=\r\n exists\nhere but the Lord, the Creator of all things, one is no longer atta=\r\nched to\nanything. 11.2\n\nRealising that misfortune and fortune come in their=\r\n own time from fortune,\none is contented, one&#39;s senses under control, and d=\r\noes not like or dislike.\n11.3\n\nRealising that pleasure and pain, birth and =\r\ndeath are from destiny, and that\none&#39;s desires cannot be achieved, one rema=\r\nins inactive, and even when acting\ndoes not get attached. 11.4\n\nRealising t=\r\nhat suffering arises from nothing other than thought, dropping\nall desires =\r\none rids oneself of it, and is happy and at peace everywhere.\n11.5\n\nRealisi=\r\nng, &quot;I am not the body, nor is the body mine. I am awareness,&quot; one\nattains =\r\nthe supreme state and no longer remembers things done or undone.\n11.6\n\nReal=\r\nising, &quot;I alone exist, from Brahma down to the last clump of grass,&quot; one\nbe=\r\ncomes free from uncertainty, pure, at peace, and unconcerned about what\nhas=\r\n been attained or not. 11.7\n\nRealising that all this varied and wonderful w=\r\norld is nothing, one becomes\npure receptivity, free from inclinations, and =\r\nas if nothing existed, one\nfinds peace. 11.8\n\n\nJanaka said:\n\nFirst of all I=\r\n was averse to physical activity, then to lengthy speech, and\nfinally to th=\r\nought itself, which is why I am now established. 12.1\n\nIn the absence of de=\r\nlight in sound and the other senses, and by the fact\nthat I am myself not a=\r\nn object of the senses, my mind is focused and free\nfrom distraction -- whi=\r\nch is why I am now established. 12.2\n\nOwing to the distraction of such thin=\r\ngs as wrong identification, one is\ndriven to strive for mental stillness. R=\r\necognising this pattern I am now\nestablished. 12.3\n\nBy relinquishing the se=\r\nnse of rejection and acceptance, and with pleasure\nand disappointment ceasi=\r\nng today, brahmin -- I am now established. 12.4\n\nLife in a community, then =\r\ngoing beyond such a state, meditation and the\nelimination of mind-made obje=\r\ncts -- by means of these I have seen my error,\nand I am now established. 12=\r\n.5\n\nJust as the performance of actions is due to ignorance, so their abando=\r\nnment\nis too. By fully recognising this truth, I am now established. 12.6\n\n=\r\nTrying to think the unthinkable, is doing something unnatural to thought.\nA=\r\nbandoning such a practice therefore, I am now established. 12.7\n\nHe who has=\r\n achieved this has achieved the goal of life. He who is of such a\nnature ha=\r\ns done what has to be done. 12.8\n\n\nJanaka said:\n\nThe inner freedom of havin=\r\ng nothing is hard to achieve, even with just a\nloin-cloth, but I live as I =\r\nplease, abandoning both renunciation and\nacquisition. 13.1\n\nSometimes one e=\r\nxperiences distress because of one&#39;s body, sometimes because\nof one&#39;s speec=\r\nh, and sometimes because of one&#39;s mind. Abandoning all of\nthese, I live as =\r\nI please in the goal of human life. 13.2\n\nRecognising that in reality no ac=\r\ntion is ever committed, I live as I please,\njust doing what presents itself=\r\n to be done. 13.3\n\nYogis who identify themselves with their bodies are insi=\r\nstent on fulfilling\nand avoiding certain actions, but I live as I please ab=\r\nandoning attachment\nand rejection. 13.4\n\nNo benefit or loss comes to me by =\r\nstanding, walking or lying down, so\nconsequently I live as I please whether=\r\n standing, walking or sleeping.13.5\n\nI lose nothing by sleeping and gain no=\r\nthing by effort, so consequently I\nlive as I please, abandoning success and=\r\n failure. 13.6\n\nContinually observing the drawbacks of such things as pleas=\r\nant objects, I\nlive as I please, abandoning the pleasant and unpleasant. 13=\r\n.7\n\n\nJanaka said:\n\nHe who by nature is empty-minded, and who thinks of thin=\r\ngs only\nunintentionally, is freed from deliberate remembering like one awak=\r\nened from\na dream. 14.1\n\nWhen my desire has been eliminated, I have no weal=\r\nth, friends, robbers,\nsenses, scriptures or knowledge. 14.2\n\nRealising my s=\r\nupreme self-nature in the Person of the Witness, the Lord,and\nthe state of =\r\ndesirelessness in bondage or liberation, I feel no inclination\nfor liberati=\r\non. 14.3\n\nThe various states of one who is free of uncertainty within, and =\r\nwho\noutwardly wanders about as he pleases like an idiot, can only be known =\r\nby\nsomeone in the same condition. 14.4\n\n\nAshtavakra said:\n\nWhile a man of p=\r\nure intelligence may achieve the goal by the most casual of\ninstruction, an=\r\nother may seek knowledge all his life and still remain\nbewildered. 15.1\n\nLi=\r\nberation is distaste for the objects of the senses. Bondage is love of the\n=\r\nsenses. This is knowledge. Now do as you wish. 15.2\n\nThis awareness of the =\r\ntruth makes an eloquent, clever and energetic man\ndumb, stupid and lazy, so=\r\n it is avoided by those whose aim is enjoyment.\n15.3\n\nYou are not the body,=\r\n nor is the body yours, nor are you the doer of actions\nor the reaper of th=\r\neir consequences. You are eternally pure consciousness,\nthe witness, in nee=\r\nd of nothing -- so live happily. 15.4\n\nDesire and anger are objects of the =\r\nmind, but the mind is not yours, nor\never has been. You are choiceless awar=\r\neness itself and unchanging -- so live\nhappily. 15.5\n\nRecognising oneself i=\r\nn all beings, and all beings in oneself, be happy, free\nfrom the sense of r=\r\nesponsibility and free from preoccupation with &quot;me.&quot; 15.6\n\nYour nature is t=\r\nhe consciousness, in which the whole world wells up, like\nwaves in the sea.=\r\n That is what you are, without any doubt, so be free of\ndisturbance. 15.7\n\n=\r\nHave faith, my son, have faith. Don&#39;t let yourself be deluded in this. You\n=\r\nare yourself the Lord, whose very nature is knowledge, and you are beyond\nn=\r\natural causation. 15.8\n\nThe body invested with the senses stands still, and=\r\n comes and goes. You\nyourself neither come nor go, so why bother about them=\r\n? 15.9\n\nLet the body last to the end of the Age, or let it come to an end r=\r\night now.\nWhat have you gained or lost, who consist of pure consciousness? =\r\n15.10\n\nLet the world wave rise or subside according to its own nature in yo=\r\nu, the\ngreat ocean. It is no gain or loss to you. 15.11\n\nMy son, you consis=\r\nt of pure consciousness, and the world is not separate\nfrom you. So who is =\r\nto accept or reject it, and how, and why? 15.12\n\nHow can there be either bi=\r\nrth, karma, or responsibility in that one\nunchanging, peaceful, unblemished=\r\n, and infinite consciousness which is you?\n15.13\n\nWhatever you see, it is y=\r\nou alone manifest in it. How can bracelets, armlets\nand anklets be differen=\r\nt from the gold they are made of? 15.14\n\nGiving up such distinctions as &quot;He=\r\n is what I am,&quot; and &quot;I am not that,&quot;\nrecognise that &quot;Everything is myself,&quot;=\r\n and be without distinction and happy.\n15.15\n\nIt is through your ignorance =\r\nthat all this exists. In reality you alone\nexist. Apart from you there is n=\r\no one within or beyond samsara. 15.16\n\nKnowing that all this is just an ill=\r\nusion, one becomes free of desire, pure\nreceptivity, and at peace, as if no=\r\nthing existed. 15.17\n\nOnly one thing has existed, exists and will exist in =\r\nthe ocean of being. You\nhave no bondage or liberation. Live happily and ful=\r\nfilled. 15.18\n\nBeing pure consciousness, do not disturb your mind with thou=\r\nghts of for and\nagainst. Be at peace and remain happily in yourself, the es=\r\nsence of joy.\n15.19\n\nGive up meditation completely but don&#39;t let the mind h=\r\nold on to anything.\nYou are free by nature, so what will you achieve by for=\r\ncing the mind? 15.20\n\nSource: http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ashtavakragita.htm=\r\nl\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=\r\n=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--20cf3074b2c879058004a97e68c5\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nAshtavakra said:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Abandon=\r\n desire, the enemy, along with gain, itself so full of loss, and the good d=\r\needs which are the cause of the other two -- practice indifference to every=\r\nthing. 10.1&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Look on such t=\r\nhings as friends, land, money, property, wife, and bequests as nothing but =\r\na dream or a magician&#39;s show lasting three or five days. 10.2&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Wherever a desire occurs, see samsara=\r\n in it.

You are choiceless awareness itself and unchanging -- so live =\r\nhappily. 15.5&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Recognising oneself in all beings, and all bein=\r\ngs in oneself, be happy, free from the sense of responsibility and free fro=\r\nm preoccupation with &quot;me.&quot; 15.6&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Your nature is the consc=\r\niousness, in which the whole world wells up, like waves in the sea. That is=\r\n what you are, without any doubt, so be free of disturbance. 15.7&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ha=\r\nve faith, my son, have faith. Don&#39;t let yourself be deluded in this. Yo=\r\nu are yourself the Lord, whose very nature is knowledge, and you are beyond=\r\n natural causation. 15.8&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The body invested with the senses stands =\r\nstill, and comes and goes. You yourself neither come nor go, so why bother =\r\nabout them? 15.9&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Let the body last to the end of the Age, or let it =\r\ncome to an end right now. What have you gained or lost, who consist of pure=\r\n consciousness? 15.10&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Let the world wave rise or subside according=\r\n to its own nature in you, the great ocean. It is no gain or loss to you. 1=\r\n5.11&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My son, you consist of pure consciousness, and the world is not=\r\n separate from you. So who is to accept or reject it, and how, and why? 15.=\r\n12&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;How can there be either birth,=\r\n karma, or responsibility in that one unchanging, peaceful, unblemished, an=\r\nd infinite consciousness which is you? 15.13&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Whatever you see, it is you alone manifest in it. How can =\r\nbracelets, armlets and anklets be different from the gold they are made of?=\r\n 15.14&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Giving up such distinctions as &quot;He is what I am=\r\n,&quot; and &quot;I am not that,&quot; recognise that &quot;Everything is m=\r\nyself,&quot; and be without distinction and happy. 15.15&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is throu=\r\ngh your ignorance that all this exists. In reality you alone exist. Apart f=\r\nrom you there is no one within or beyond samsara. 15.16&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Knowing th=\r\nat all this is just an illusion, one becomes free of desire, pure receptivi=\r\nty, and at peace, as if nothing existed. 15.17&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only one thing has ex=\r\nisted, exists and will exist in the ocean of being. You have no bondage or =\r\nliberation. Live happily and fulfilled. 15.18&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Being pure conscious=\r\nness, do not disturb your mind with thoughts of for and against. Be at peac=\r\ne and remain happily in yourself, the essence of joy. 15.19&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Give up meditation completely but don&#39;t let th=\r\ne mind hold on to anything. You are free by nature, so what will you achiev=\r\ne by forcing the mind? 15.20&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ashtavakragita.html=\r\n&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://bhagavan-ramana.org/ashtavakragita.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;div =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;ma=\r\nrgin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, =\r\n51, 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;=\r\nmargin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=\r\n=82=C2=A0 =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B=C2=A0 =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=87=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80=C2=A0 =E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF=C2=A0=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=\r\n=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=C2=A0 =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=\r\n=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81=C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--20cf3074b2c879058004a97e68c5--\r\n\n"}}
