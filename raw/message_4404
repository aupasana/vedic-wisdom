He was 89-years-old. The Swami&#39;s remarkab=\r\nle\nstory was edited by David Godman and published in 1994 by the Sri Annama=\r\nlai\nSwami Ashram Trust.\n\nAnnamalai Swami came to the Maharshi in 1928 and, =\r\nat the Sage&#39;s behest,\nundertook the supervision in the construction of the =\r\nGoshala (cow shed),\nDining Hall, Dispensary and various other projects. In =\r\nthe mid-1940s,\nBhagavan instructed him to leave the ashram and engage in in=\r\ntense sadhana. He\nwould then occasionally meet the Maharshi on his walks, b=\r\nut never again in\nthe fifty years that followed did he reenter Sri Ramanasr=\r\namam, preferring to\nlive a quiet, austere life in Palakottu. His small ashr=\r\nam borders the\nwestern boundary of Sri Ramanasramam and he was well known t=\r\no many devotees\nand visitors to Tiruvannamalai.\n\nIn the passage below, exce=\r\nrpted from Living By the Words Of Bhagavan,\nAnnamalai Swami relates the inc=\r\nidents preceding his departure from Sri\nRamanasramam.\n\n* * *\nI came from To=\r\nndanguruchi where I had a stall to distribute water to the\nneedy. One day s=\r\nomebody showed me the book Nan Yar (Who Am I?). I saw\nBhagavan&#39;s picture an=\r\nd was instantly captivated.\n\nI hastened to Tiruvannamalai the very same day=\r\n, which happened to be a full\nmoon day. When I arrived at Tiruvannamalai, I=\r\n chanced to meet Seshadri Swami\nnear the Rettai Pillaiyar Koil, close to th=\r\ne big temple, and received his\nblessings. I then went to Sri Bhagavan.\n\nMY =\r\ndays as an ashram worker were coming to a close, although I didn&#39;t\nrealize =\r\nit at the time. In retrospect I can remember only one small incident\nwhich =\r\nindicated that Bhagavan knew that my time in the ashram was coming to\nan en=\r\nd.\n\nI was doing some digging with a crowbar when Bhagavan came and asked me=\r\n,\n&quot;Did you decide to do this work yourself or did Chinnaswami ask you to do=\r\n it\n?&quot;\n\nI told him that Chinnaswami had asked me to do it. Bhagavan was not=\r\n very\npleased.\n\n&quot;So, he has given you work. So, he has given you work. Why =\r\nis he giving you\nwork like this?&quot;\n\nA little later Yogi Ramiah remarked to B=\r\nhagavan, &quot;Annamalai Swami is working\nvery hard. His body has become very we=\r\nak. You should give him some rest.&quot;\n\nBhagavan agreed with him. &quot;Yes, we hav=\r\ne to give him some rest. We have to\ngive freedom to him.&quot;\n\nA few days later=\r\n I went to Bhagavan&#39;s bathroom to help him with his morning\nbath. Madhava S=\r\nwami and I gave him the usual oil bath and massage.\n\nWhen the bath was over=\r\n Madhava Swami asked a question: &quot;Bhagavan, the people\nwho take ganja lehiy=\r\nam [an ayurvedic preparation whose principal ingredient\nis cannabis] experi=\r\nence some kind of ananda [bliss]. What is the nature of\nthis ananda ? Is it=\r\n the same ananda that the scriptures speak of?&quot;\n\n&quot;Eating this ganja is a ve=\r\nry bad habit,&quot; replied Bhagavan. Then, laughing\nloudly, he came over to me,=\r\n hugged me and called out, &quot;Ananda! Ananda! This\nis how these ganja-taking =\r\npeople behave!&quot;\n\nIt was not a brief hug. Madhava Swami told me later that h=\r\ne held me tightly\nfor about two minutes. After the first few seconds I comp=\r\nletely lost\nawareness of my body and the world. Initially, there was a feel=\r\ning of\nhappiness and bliss, but this soon gave way to a state in which ther=\r\ne were\nno feelings and no experiences. I did not lose consciousness, I just=\r\n ceased\nto be aware of anything that was going on around me. I remained in =\r\nthis\nstate for about fifteen minutes. When I recovered my usual\nworld-consc=\r\niousness I was standing alone in the bathroom. Madhava Swami and\nBhagavan h=\r\nad long since departed for breakfast. I had not seen them open the\ndoor and=\r\n leave, nor had I heard the breakfast bell.\n\nThis experience completely cha=\r\nnged my life. As soon as I recovered normal\nconsciousness I knew that my wo=\r\nrking life at Sri Ramanasramam had come to an\nend. I knew that henceforth I=\r\n would be living outside the ashram and\nspending most of my time in meditat=\r\nion. There was a rule that only those who\nworked for the ashram could live =\r\nthere full-time. Those who wanted to spend\ntheir time in meditation had to =\r\nlive somewhere else. I thus knew that I\nwould have to leave the ashram and =\r\nfend for myself, but the thought of\nlosing my regular meals and my room nev=\r\ner troubled me.\n\nI made a belated appearance in the dining room to eat my l=\r\nast breakfast. As\nsoon as I had finished eating I went up onto the hill to =\r\nlook for Bhagavan.\nI found him sitting on a big rock.\n\n&quot;I have decided to l=\r\neave the ashram,&quot; I said. &quot;I want to go to Palakottu to\nlive alone and medi=\r\ntate.&quot;\n\n&quot;Ah! Very good! Very good! Very good!&quot; exclaimed Bhagavan.\n\nThe dec=\r\nision clearly had his approval. How could it be otherwise since it\nwas Bhag=\r\navan himself who gave me the experience which precipitated the\ndecision?\n\nA=\r\nfter getting Bhagavan&#39;s permission I packed my possessions and locked my\nro=\r\nom. I also locked all the other places that were in my charge.\n\nI took the =\r\nbunch of keys to Chinnaswami and told him, &quot;I have decided to go\nand live i=\r\nn Palakottu. Please take these keys and keep them.&quot;\n\nChinnaswami was, quite=\r\n naturally, very surprised. &quot;Why are you leaving?&quot; he\nasked. &quot;You have cons=\r\ntructed all these buildings. You have done so much\nhere. How can you go aft=\r\ner doing all this work? Where will you sleep? How\nwill you eat? You will ha=\r\nve many troubles because you have no way of\nsupporting yourself. Don&#39;t go, =\r\nstay here.&quot;\n\nI told him that I would not change my mind. I also tried to gi=\r\nve him the\nkeys but he refused to accept them. I didn&#39;t want another argume=\r\nnt with him\nso I just handed over the keys to Subramaniam, who was also in =\r\nthe office,\nand left.\n\nIt was an abrupt change in my life. Within a few hou=\r\nrs of having the\nexperience I was walking to Palakottu, knowing full well t=\r\nhat I had left all\nof my old working life behind me.\n\nSources:\n\n1) http://w=\r\nww.arunachala.org/newsletters/1996/?pg=3Djan-feb\n2) http://www.arunachala.o=\r\nrg/newsletters/2005/?pg=3Dnov-dec\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=\r\n=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=\r\n=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=\r\n=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636c5c058130cd10487dc7178\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nAnnamalai Swami, a lifelong devotee of Sri Ramana Maharshi, was =\r\nabsorbed in his Master on November 9, 1995.
