There should be =\r\nabout 700 offerings in saptashati like this.\n \nIn addition, outside of the =\r\n700 offerings, there are things like kavacham, argala, keelakam, raatri soo=\r\nktam and devi sooktam. In kavacham, no offerings are made. In argala and ke=\r\nelakam, only ghee is offered by adding swaahaa after each verse. I suggeste=\r\nd reading raatri sooktam and devi sooktam without swaahaa, because adding s=\r\nwaahaa at the end of a Vedic verse with intonation is tricky. The swaahaa m=\r\nay require a modifcation in the intonation or even the anuswara of the last=\r\n syllable of the Vedic verse to which you add swaahaa. That is why I sugges=\r\nted reading raatri sooktam and devi sooktam without swaahaa.\n \nFor the 700 =\r\nverses of saptashati, there is no issue in adding swaahaa.\n \nBest regards,\n=\r\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It =\r\nYourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n               =\r\n   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http:/=\r\n/SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- A=\r\nnup Ray &lt;aray_usa@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Ravi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your r=\r\nesponse. \n&gt; I guess Narasimhaji advised on not using swaha inappropriately =\r\nif we are not well-versed in Sanskrit language.
