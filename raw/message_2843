Since many of my colleagues were going to=\r\n Kalighat, i accompanied them. there was a big queue to have darshan of &#39;Ma=\r\na Kali&#39;. It was an exhausting wait of 1 hour before we could enter &#39;Sanctum=\r\n sanctorum&#39; where &#39;Maa&#39; was standing in her full beauty. Moment I entered i=\r\nt, i could immediately feel spiritual and divine presence of &#39;Maa&#39;. That fe=\r\neling remained for quite sometime. This happened despite the fact that i am=\r\n very ordinary person. Only sadhana (if at all it can be called sadhana) wh=\r\nich i was doing was that i was observing 9 days fast during (winter) Navrat=\r\nri since 1995. Still I could feel divine presence. \nAbove is narrated to st=\r\nate that no two persons may have same feeling and experience, some may expe=\r\nrience and some may not. This is especially applicable to ordinary people l=\r\nike me. \n\nYogis and saints are much elevated being they can perceive consis=\r\ntently correctly.\n\nAs one progresses on spiritual path, one becomes more qu=\r\nalified to feel spirituality of place and person. If an ordinary person is =\r\nsitting next to a yogi, that person may not feel greatness of person, unles=\r\ns yogi wills otherwise. But if someone is in serious sadhana, one instantly=\r\n recognizes spiritual energy of yogi, even if yogi is disguised. \n\nPlaces o=\r\nf worship are thronged by multitudes of people, most of them with love and =\r\ndevotion to god. Sheer collective will and emotions of these many people, c=\r\nreates spiritual environment. Hence, normally place of worship, do have env=\r\nelope spiritual energy. Question can be of degree of spiritual energy, some=\r\n places with regular `pran pratishtha&#39; , and attended  by elevated `Pujari&#39;=\r\n will definitely offer better environment. This applies with every place of=\r\n worship. If a spiritual Hindu visits a `Mosque&#39; or `Gurudwara&#39; or any othe=\r\nr place of worship, he will feel divine presence.\nPlace of worship serves a=\r\ns symbol of almighty, which offers convenient and easy way for an ordinary =\r\npeople to remain connected with lord. But most of us fail to realize that t=\r\nhis is just a beginning, one has to cross this, progress further. If one re=\r\nmains attached to place of worship and thinks that regular visits to holy p=\r\nlace will elevate one spiritually, then he is mistaken. Most of the people =\r\nare stuck at this level. This being `kaliyug&#39; not many mahatmas are present=\r\n in society to help people to move forward.\nRegards,\nSanjeev\n--- In vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

While different places and times have some difference in the=\r\n nature and degree of spiritual energy, one can experience anything anywher=\r\ne anytime, if the internal factors are conducive.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (2) What I said abo=\r\nut Dakshineshwar vs Kalighat is purely my observation. Please bear in mind =\r\nthat any observation is fallible! It is possible that Kalighat has similar =\r\nor higher spiritual energy compared to Dakshineshwar and I simply failed to=\r\n perceive it. What we are able to perceive and observe is also based on our=\r\n own mental conditioning and our own karmik debts. The Mother is capable of=\r\n deluding *anyone*.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; But then, what ever the idol may contain, posti=\r\nve/negative/creative/\n&gt; &gt; destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion=\r\n, assuming that it is\n&gt; &gt; reaching God, is it not enough?\n&gt;  \n&gt; The purpose=\r\n of an idol is to evoke certain imagery or thought in you. If a spiritual p=\r\nerson imagines a particular energy or form of god in a particular object on=\r\n a continuous basis, slowly that form gets &quot;established&quot; in that idol. As t=\r\nime goes on, his mind can be focused on that specific form faster and easie=\r\nr by simply looking at the idol. Though we think that our minds are separat=\r\ne entities, they are all connected feebly and all of us are able to perceiv=\r\ne in some vague form other people&#39;s strong thoughts that are present in the=\r\n ether. Thus, if an idol is working as a repository of several spiritual th=\r\noughts of a person trying to focus on a form of god, seeing that idol can e=\r\nvoke some similar thoughts in another person too.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, there is s=\r\nome translation involved when thoughts of one mind are vaguely perceived an=\r\nd interpreted by another mind. This translation is dependent on one&#39;s menta=\r\nl conditioning. Thus, what we perceive at the end is conformant to our own =\r\nmental conditioning!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Suppose a foolish person thought while praying t=\r\no an idol everyday of a fierce goddess who kills all of one&#39;s enemies, brin=\r\ngs people under one&#39;s control and makes one successful. Suppose you focus o=\r\nn that idol. Then you are susceptible to that kind of thoughts. However, if=\r\n you see her as someone who helps you overcome your weaknesses and become d=\r\nispassionate, nothing bad is going to happen to you. But the fact that some=\r\none used that idol as a repository of negative thoughts becomes a minor obs=\r\ntruction.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, please note that this principle works without an i=\r\ndol too. Suppose someone goes to a particular place (e.g. a church bench) a=\r\nnd prays to god with certain desires/thoughts everyday. Those thoughts are =\r\npresent in the air there. Anyone praying there later may be a little suscep=\r\ntible to such thoughts. The concentration of thoughts may be a little highe=\r\nr when an idol serves as a repository as opposed to just air. That&#39;s all.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; However, please note that most people have some devotion, some surrend=\r\ner, some love and some fear of wrong-doing when they are praying to god, wi=\r\nthin or without an idol. Thus, any negative and selfish thoughts are also a=\r\nccompanied by a lot of desirable thoughts. Thus, the downside I mentioned i=\r\ns not a big deal. This downside becomes considerable only in rare cases of =\r\nreally taamasik sadhakas indulging in terrible practices without understand=\r\ning what they are doing.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; is Idol worship risky?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Bottomline is=\r\n that I do not see any risk in idol worship.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Does Man create God, or God creates man?\n&gt;  \n&gt; God created man as his r=\r\neplica. But the replica got corrupted with time. Now, man needs to recreate=\r\n god in his mind and fill the mind with god, so that he can go back to the =\r\nsource and become free from this cycle. But, due to the corruptions/conditi=\r\noning of the mind, he is not able to create god correctly. He ends up creat=\r\ning god as a replica of his current corrupt state! The goal is to keep crea=\r\nting god in mind and keep refining him and hence keep refining oneself and =\r\neventually become pure. When one is pure and creates god as a replica of on=\r\neself, that god will match the god that created man in the first place. Whe=\r\nn that god fills one&#39;s mind, one is free from the cycle.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *  =\r\n      *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I saw people deviating and speaking disrespectfully about res=\r\npected spiritual leaders of other religions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In general, please remem=\r\nber that saying negative things about people that one may not have understo=\r\nod fully or correctly is unwise.\n&gt;  \n&gt; From time to time, the Lord may send=\r\n someone to a part of the world to maintain the correct balance of dharma a=\r\nnd adhrama that is required in that part of the world at that time. One can=\r\nnot judge a yogi or spiritual teacher based on how many misdeeds were done =\r\nby people claiming to follow that person. Worse things may have happened if=\r\n god did not send that person! If some people following a yogi or spiritual=\r\n teacher attained some level of realization, it means something. Let us not=\r\n be harsh in judging people we have not met physically or otherwise.\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nIf one is unhappy because of misdeeds committed by people claiming to a fol=\r\nlow a yogi or spiritual teacher, that may be justified. But, Nature will co=\r\nrrect things and change the equilibrium from time and time. Leave things to=\r\n Nature and do your part by doing sadhana. In fact, my firm belief is that =\r\nwe are on the cusp of a big change in the equilibrium at many levels.\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ta=\r\nrpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyo=\r\ntish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish softw=\r\nare (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: =\r\nhttp://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: rajar=\r\nshi nandy \n&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, Octobe=\r\nr 08, 2009 2:38 PM\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Holy Places\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n        Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt;         To add to my query, a good number of religion=\r\ns explicitly prohibit idol worship. If the underlying truth is one, how can=\r\n it be so contradictory? \n&gt; \n&gt;         I can understand that a Idol may con=\r\ntain a presence created by human imagination which maynot have a divine lin=\r\nk. Not everybody is a Ramakrishna who can actually call Mahakali into an Id=\r\nol.\n&gt; \n&gt;         But then, what ever the idol may contain, postive/negative=\r\n/creative/destruction, if someone prays to it with devotion, assuming that =\r\nit is reaching God, is it not enough? After all God is finally tax collecte=\r\nr of prayers. Does not all prayer finally reach God, irrespective of whethe=\r\nr a divine presence is there or not there infront?\n&gt; \n&gt;         I would lik=\r\ne to mention a small incident here about someone I know well. There was a c=\r\nertain individual, who whenever he would go to Calcutta. he would take time=\r\n out to go and meditate in the hall infornt of the idol at the Kaalighat te=\r\nmple. Once he reached the temple around 8 pm and sat there trying to mediat=\r\ne for about 2 hours. His mind suddenly became very focused, he *thought* he=\r\n saw some deep blue lights (probably just his imagination) - but there was =\r\na distinct feeling of great joy in him. His mind become without thoughts as=\r\n if there was no worry in the whole world, everything was perfect.  Also a =\r\nstrong, sanguine feeling came into him that he needed to worship the Goddes=\r\ns. As he came out he found that his shoes were missing, so he walked more t=\r\nhan a kilometer distance bare feet though an extremely dirty road but all h=\r\ne felt was a deep joy. Nothing was actually registering in his mind that ni=\r\nght, except for an overwhelming joy, as he said later on. Bottomline: a nic=\r\ne spiritual experience.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Some months later he ended up meeting =\r\na very spiritual person who instructed him about worshipping the Goddess.  =\r\nHe strongly believes that night at the temple and his meeting with the pers=\r\non was related. Interestingly, even that spiritual person told him that the=\r\nre is probably no divine presence inside the idol at Kaalighat temple.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n         Now my question is, if the idol at the Kaalighat temple did not ha=\r\nve a divine presence why did this person suddenly have such a nice meditati=\r\non there?  Does it mean that finally it is only the devotion of the devotee=\r\n which counts for spiritual energy inside a temple, irrespective of whether=\r\n the idol has any energy at all?\n&gt; \n&gt;         -Regards\n&gt;          Rajarshi\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;         --- On Thu, 8/10/09, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n          From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt;           Subject: Re: [v=\r\nedic-wisdom] Re: Holy Places\n&gt;           To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;=\r\n           Date: Thursday, 8 October, 2009, 8:24 PM\n&gt; \n&gt;            \n&gt;     =\r\n            Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt;                 In this context of divine pressen=\r\nce, is Idol worship risky?

However, eventually the smell w=\r\nill be gone! How long it takes to disappear depends on how strong the smell=\r\n was when the stick was burnt.\n&gt; \n&gt;                   Similarly, when a gre=\r\nat saint meditates in a place, the air there will be filled with that saint=\r\n&#39;s spiritual energy. Even after the saint leaves that place or leaves earth=\r\n altogether, that energy will linger there. Slowly it becomes weak and disa=\r\nppears.\n&gt; \n&gt;                   In many famous temples these days, priests h=\r\nave become commercial and do not have the devotion needed. The rituals perf=\r\normed every few years to re-energize the idols \n&gt; \n&gt;                   *   =\r\n     *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;                   It is my humble opinion that some fa=\r\nmous temples do not have much divine presence today, though I do not want t=\r\no name any names. At the same time, some not-so-well- known temples seem to=\r\n have a powerful divine presence.\n&gt; \n&gt;                   I was very impress=\r\ned with the Krishna temple in Mayapur (ISKCON head office is there), Girnar=\r\n hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;=\r\ns place). There is a tremendous amount of spiritual energy in those places.=\r\n There are several temples where the idol is practically alive. For example=\r\n, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Daks=\r\nhineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression at the famous Kalig=\r\nhat temple which is also in Calcutta.\n&gt; \n&gt;                   There was one =\r\nsmall temple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a priest who took me to v=\r\nisit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu before we did the Shata Chandi ho=\r\nmam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that temple before and it seemed l=\r\nike a small temple. The name of the form of the divine Mother present there=\r\n was a Tamil language name and I did not understand it. I do not even remem=\r\nber the name now. But, when I closed my eyes and started meditating with my=\r\n mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of a very fierce go=\r\nddess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that there was a powerfu=\r\nl presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the name of the place or=\r\n the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the goddess. They tried =\r\nto put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the roof came down in a fir=\r\ne accident each time and they finally decided that the goddess likes open a=\r\nir and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min and left in a hurry, I was very =\r\npleased with that temple. Someone from Tamil Nadu probably knows the name o=\r\nf the temple and goddess.\n&gt; \n&gt;                   Like this, I am sure there=\r\n are many temples with a powerful divine presence across India.\n&gt; \n&gt;       =\r\n            Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one of my best ex=\r\nperiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at Aalandi near=\r\n Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in the undergr=\r\nound chamber there.\n&gt; \n&gt;                   *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;        =\r\n           Even the middle of a busy road in India is better for meditating=\r\n than a temple in USA. These western countries are so filled with rajas and=\r\n tamas. There is rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of sattwa t=\r\nhere. Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my vi=\r\new is that there is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are r=\r\neally good.\n&gt; \n&gt;                   If one has a chance to spend a few month=\r\ns doing spiritual sadhana near a temple, I suggest the following:\n&gt; \n&gt;     =\r\n              Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurt=\r\naalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills) and Narayana vanam (near Tirupati=\r\n) in south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) =\r\nin west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisai=\r\nlam and Mantralayam and Ujjain in central India.\n&gt; \n&gt;                   The=\r\nre are many other good places, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a te=\r\nmple once is one thing and staying there for several months while maintaini=\r\nng a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) t=\r\nhere is quite another.\n&gt; \n&gt;                   Best regards,\n&gt;              =\r\n     Narasimha\n&gt;                   ------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt;                   Do a Short Homam Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt;                   Do Pitri Ta=\r\nrpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;                =\r\n   Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;           =\r\n        Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; =\r\n                  Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org\n&gt;                   Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ gro=\r\nup/JyotishWri tings\n&gt;                   Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:=\r\n http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;                   ------------ --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; \n&gt;                     -=\r\n---- Original Message ----- \n&gt;                     From: Astro Seeker \n&gt;   =\r\n                  To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt;                    =\r\n Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 AM\n&gt;                     Subject: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] Holy Places\n&gt; \n&gt;                           Respected Narsimha=\r\nji, \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                           I would like to know your opinion on=\r\n holy places (famous temples etc) in today&#39;s time.
