You know Ramachan=\r\ndra Rao, an Ayurvedic\nphysician? For preparing a medicine that would give s=\r\ntrength to Bhagavan=92s\nbody, he made out a long list of the necessary herb=\r\ns and ingredients and\nshowed it to Sri Bhagavan.\n\nLike a good boy, who woul=\r\nd readily obey instructions, Bhagavan went through\nthe whole list, praised =\r\nthe efficacy of the various drugs and finally\nsaid,=93For whom is this medi=\r\ncine, my dear man?=94 He said quietly, =93For Sri\nBhagavan himself.=94\n\nOn =\r\nhearing that, Bhagavan said, =93No doubt, you have given me a long list,\nbu=\r\nt where am I to get the money for it? It may cost Rs. 10/-, and whom am I\nt=\r\no approach for it?&quot;\n\nSomeone quietly said, looking around at the Ashram pro=\r\nperty, =93Whose is all\nthis, Swamiji?=94\n\n=93Yes, but what have I? If I wan=\r\nt a quarter anna, I must go and ask the\nSarvadhikari. How should I go and a=\r\nsk him? He gives me a little food, if I\ngo there as soon as the bell rings.=\r\n I also eat along with the others and\nthen come back, and I might be refuse=\r\nd food if I was late. Even in being\nserved food, I come last,=94 said Bhaga=\r\nvan.\n\nThe poor physician trembled with fear and, with folded hands, said,\n=\r\n=93Swamiji, I just showed you the list and I myself will get the required\nd=\r\nrugs.=94\n\nUpon this Bhagavan said, =93Oh yes? You will get them? But if tha=\r\nt medicine is\ngood for me, it must necessarily be good for all the others h=\r\nere. Can you\ngive it to them also as well as to me?=94\n\nWhen some people sa=\r\nid, =93Why do we want it, Swamiji?=94\n\nBhagavan replied, =93If people who d=\r\no physical work don=92t need a body-building\ntonic, how do I who merely sit=\r\ns here and eats? No, no, that can=92t be!=94\n\nOnce before, Dr. Srinivasa Ra=\r\no told Bhagavan about an Allopathic medicine\nwhich gives strength and said =\r\nthat it would be good for Bhagavan if he took\nit.\n\nBhagavan said,=93Yes, th=\r\nat is all right, you are rich and can take anything;\nbut what about me? I a=\r\nm a mendicant. How can I have such a costly\nmedicine?=94\n\nThen the doctor s=\r\naid, =93Bhagavan always declines everything that is offered,\nbut if he agre=\r\nes to take something, won=92t it be forthcoming? Or if not\nmedicines,why no=\r\nt take some nutritious food such as milk, fruit and\nalmonds?=94\n\nBhagavan r=\r\neplied: =93All right; but I am a daridranarayana (God in the form of\nthe po=\r\nor and the destitute). How can I afford it? Besides, am I a single\nindividu=\r\nal? Mine is a large family. How can all of them have fruits, milk,\nalmonds,=\r\n etc.?=94 Bhagavan dislikes anything special for himself.\n\nHe has often tol=\r\nd us that if anybody brings eatables and distributes them\namongst all he wi=\r\nll not mind even if he is left out, but he will feel hurt\nif the eatables a=\r\nre given to him only and not distributed to others along\nwith him.\n\nIf he i=\r\ns walking along a path, and some people are coming in the opposite\ndirectio=\r\nn, he does not like them to step aside for him but instead he will\nhimself =\r\nstep aside and allow them to pass and, until they do, he will not go\na step=\r\n farther.\n\nSource: Letters from Sri Ramanasramam VOLUMES I, II & Letters fr=\r\nom and\nRecollections of Sri Ramanasramam By SURI NAGAMMA Translated by D.
