He gave me permi=\r\nssion to share it with anyone who may be interested. His name is Dr Satya P=\r\nrakash Choudhary.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have been doing a Chandi homam daily for more tha=\r\nn 3 years and chant these 700 verses everyday in front of fire. Whatever li=\r\nttle insights were given by fire after repeated chanting are closely aligne=\r\nd with the esoteric interpretation given by Dr Choudhary in this writeup.
