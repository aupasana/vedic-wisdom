For example, one offers a \n\nfull coconut into fire as poornaahuti (com=\r\nplete offering) at the end of a \n\nhomam (fire ritual). This is symbolic of =\r\nsurrendering one&#39;s head or ego \n\n(sense of I-ness) to god and burning it in=\r\n the fire of wisdom and becoming \n\nfree from ego. As one keeps engaging in =\r\nthis act again and again, the \n\nvisualization becomes stronger and stronger=\r\n and ego is slowly reduced.\n\n\n\n&quot;One important ritual of Hinduism is tarpana=\r\n. Tarpana means &quot;satisfying&quot; or \n\n&quot;satiating&quot;. One acknowledges the debt on=\r\ne has to devas (gods), rishis \n\n(sages) and pitris (ancestral manes) and tr=\r\nies to satisfy them using this \n\nritual. Just as gods are invoked in fire i=\r\nn a homam, pitris are invoked in \n\nwater in this ritual, then held in the p=\r\nalm and released in a specific way \n\nconducive to freeing them.\n\n\n\n&quot;One owe=\r\ns a lot to one&#39;s parents and ancestors. In modern scientific terms, \n\none o=\r\nwes all of one&#39;s genetic characteristics to one&#39;s parents and \n\nancestors. =\r\nEach ancestor is actually present in the person as a genetic \n\ncharacterist=\r\nic. In karmik terms, one inherits some karmas of one&#39;s parents \n\nand ancest=\r\nors and each ancestor is actually present in the person as a \n\nkaarmik pred=\r\nisposition. The latter approach obviously extends to multiple \n\nlives and s=\r\nome karmik predisposition is inherited from the ancestors from a \n\npast lif=\r\ne too, though they may not be related to one in this life.\n\n\n\n&quot;By thinking =\r\nof the deceased ancestors with gratitude and trying to give \n\nthem an emanc=\r\nipation, one is actually trying to free oneself from various \n\nkaarmic pred=\r\nispositions that one has as a result of the rina (karmik debt) \n\nwith sever=\r\nal people. One can view this as an external event of satisfying \n\nand emanc=\r\nipating an external entity (a pitri). Alternately, one can view \n\nthis as a=\r\nn internal event of satisfying and releasing an internal kaarmik \n\npredispo=\r\nsition. Ultimately, it is the latter. However, one needs to \n\nexternalize f=\r\nirst and perform external rituals, while thinking of what it \n\nmeans intern=\r\nally. This builds up one&#39;s visualization and slowly brings about \n\ninternal=\r\n changes and eventually the desired internal change itself.&quot;\n\n------------ =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nNarasimha\n\n------------ =\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\nDo a Short Homam Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.=\r\ncom/ group/vedic- wisdom\n\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. ho=\r\nme.comcast. net\n\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rolog=\r\ner.org\n\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n\n-=\r\n----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n\n\n----- O=\r\nriginal Message ----- \n\nFrom: &quot;shanvar4&quot; &lt;shanvar4@yahoo. com&gt;\n\nTo: &lt;vedic-=\r\nwisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n\nSent: Wednesday, January 28, 2009 10:28 AM\n\nSubj=\r\nect: [vedic-wisdom] Why Perform Pithri-Tharpanam?\n\n\n\n&gt; Namaskaar to all Gur=\r\nus, esp Narasimha!\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; First, not sure how -and how much -to thank you fo=\r\nr your tireless\n\n&gt; services to provide us with the fantastic and improved v=\r\nersion of\n\n&gt; JHORA!!!
