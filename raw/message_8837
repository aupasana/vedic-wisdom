It is true that my success at such times has been a=\r\nccompanied by extraordinary difficulties. But my conviction has always been=\r\n justified: faith in the divine protection, and the right use of man&#39;s God;=\r\ngiven will, are forces formidable beyond any the &quot;inverted bowl&quot; can muster=\r\n. \n\nThe starry inscription at one&#39;s birth, I came to understand, is not tha=\r\nt man is a puppet of his past. Its message is rather a prod to pride; the v=\r\nery heavens seek to arouse man&#39;s determination to be free from every limita=\r\ntion.\n\nGod created each man as a soul, dowered with individuality, hence es=\r\nsential to the universal structure, whether in the temporary role of pillar=\r\n or parasite. His freedom is final and immediate, if he so wills; it depend=\r\ns not on outer but inner victories.\n\n*** Extracts from: Autobiography of a =\r\nYogi - by Paramhansa Yogananda, 16th Chapter: Outwitting the Stars ***\n\n\n\n"}}
