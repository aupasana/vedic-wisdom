These writings are free-wheeling in nature and not well-organize=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; On 2010 Guru Pournima, my Jyotish students in Boston gifted me=\r\n a book they created out of some of those writings. They organized the writ=\r\nings topically in the form of a book.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; A lot of topics that may be=\r\n of interest to spiritual seekers are addressed in one place, in a *somewha=\r\nt* organized form. A lot of questions from members were answered in simple =\r\nlanguage and several subtle issues were addressed.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The book in PD=\r\nF format is only 1.5 MB in size and is FREE to download.
