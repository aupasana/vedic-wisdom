My Parents visited Mahaakaal last year.\nit is also said that, the main attraction of Mahaakaal is to attend\ntheir early mroning Bhasma Aarati. and people told me that it is a\ncustom to bring the ashes of last cremated body from the nearby\nsmashaan for the Bhasma Abhiskek. by the way it is well known that\nAmitabh Bachhan has a turn around in his career after rirual\nperformed at Mahaakaleshwar. KBK thing happened and came out from\ndebt etc..\nUjjain was once the capital of great king Vikramaaditya. Gujarati\ncalander year, which is Vikram Samvat is also named after him. so\ngujaraatis have connection to Ujjain:)\n\nI am not sure but is Raja Bhartuhari considered as one of the\nChiranjivis? and was under the impression that the name of his\ntreaty was Vairaagya Shataka.\n\nbut not much important. how much information we&#39;ll store in this\nmemory and what we will do with that.\n\nwarm regards,\n\nutpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Amit Trivedi &lt;sonat64@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaskaaram Miteshji,\n&gt; Thanks for the interesting info.on Ujjain&#39;s surroundings.\n&gt; As you have mentioned the most famous place here is the\nJyotirlinga of Bhagwan Mahaakaleshwar and equally vibrant place is\nShakti sthaana of Maa Harasiddhi Devi.Incidentally,Maa\nHarasiddhi has another Seat for Raatrivaas or nightstay near\nPorbandar -Gujarat.\n&gt; Raaja Bhartruhari is the revered creator of two immortal\nclassics : Nitishataka and Shringarashataka-his life is a message to\nall people to understand the redundance of the mundane wealth,beauty\nand affection. He first created &#39;Shringaara shataka&#39; describing how\nthe richly endowed people should enjoy life.... the Kaalachakra\nturned a full cycle and he was short-changed by his beloved -Raani\nPingala.The mighty king takes to the ascetic life and at the peak of\nself-realization-he created another everlasting creation-&#39; Niti\nshataka &#39; ....Strange are the ways of Almighty !!! The scholar of\nShringaara (read Bhogi) turns the scholar of Niti (roughly\nputting:Systems as in particle physics definition).\n&gt; Some people believe that Sage Bhartruhari is still roaming in\nIndia and grants Darshan to few lucky saadhakas.\n&gt;\n&gt; Humble Regards,\n&gt; amit\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Thu, 2/26/09, m540i98 &lt;m540i98@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From: m540i98 &lt;m540i98@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Region of Ujjain\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Thursday, February 26, 2009, 8:42 PM\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt;\n&gt; The region around Ujjain is considered the heart of spiritaul\nindia.\n&gt; A lot of Mahatmaas in Sookma Sareer stay in that Malwa Region and\n&gt; river Chambal.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please pardon my spellings.\n&gt;\n&gt; Amongst the famous Harisiddhi Mata Temple one of the Shakti Peets\nand\n&gt; ShivLinga Temples. Ujjain is also famous for Raja Bharathat Hari\ncave.\n&gt; Raja Barathari is considered as one of the 9 Naths from the Nath\n&gt; Sampradaya. He meditated for a long time and then he went south to\n&gt; Devas, a small town near Indore. The legend is, a drop of blood\nfrom\n&gt; Sati when Lord Shiva was carrying the corpse feel in Devas too.\nAnd\n&gt; in the same place on a hill there is a Chamunda Devi Temple. A lot\nof\n&gt; great Mahatmas since 1400 Have been staying and meditating there,\n&gt; starting with Raja Barathari, then came the Poet Chand Bardai and\nthen\n&gt; Sheelnath Maharaj and Swami Shri VishnuTirth Maharaj in the 20th\n&gt; century. Over and above the temple now there is Sheelnath maharaj\n&gt; Dhuni Sanstan and also Swami VishnuTirth Maharaj&#39;s Ashram located\nin\n&gt; the valley of the hill where Mother Chamunda temple is situated.\n&gt;\n&gt; Mother in this temple manifested many times and gave guidance and\n&gt; darshan to all of the above saints. I am sure there are others who\n&gt; benefited too.\n&gt;\n&gt; They all stayed at the Temple in devas. It is said even today many\n&gt; Mahatmas in Sooksma sareer come to pray Chamunda Devi on a regular\n&gt; basis.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards\n&gt; Mitesh\n\n\n"}}
