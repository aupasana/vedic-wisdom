In its original appli=\r\ncation, the term &#39;Devi&#39; was not a common noun as it became in later usages.=\r\n As the Devi-Mahatmya has it : &#39;MahalakshmirMahakali saiva prokta Saraswati=\r\n, Ishvari punyapapana sarvalokamaheshvari&#39; (Part 3, Chapter Vaikrtika Rahas=\r\nya, verse 25); that is, &#39;She herself is proclaimed as Mahalakshmi, Mahakali=\r\n, and (Maha) Saraswati, the great ruler of all worlds, reigning over the vi=\r\nrtuous and the wicked&#39;. She is thus one but, as proclaims the Devi-Mahatmya=\r\n, is also three, that is, she combines three in her, similar to the univers=\r\ne, which appears to be one but is three-aspected comprising &#39;tamas&#39;, &#39;rajas=\r\n&#39; and &#39;sattva&#39;, i.e., inertia, dynamism and luminosity. The equation of sag=\r\ne Markandeya is simple. Metaphysically, the Devi has been perceived as the =\r\none dynamic principle that the universe manifested in its oneness. In her f=\r\norms as Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati  manifested the cosmic dive=\r\nrsity, i.e., the three elemental components of the phenomenal universe - &#39;t=\r\namas&#39;, &#39;rajas&#39; and &#39;sattva&#39;, which not only work as instruments of creation=\r\n but also underlie all subsequent activities of creation, sustenance and di=\r\nssolution. Devi defines the totality of cosmic energy, while Mahakali, Maha=\r\nlakshmi and Mahasaraswati define its &#39;vyastis&#39;, individual aspects of this =\r\ncosmic energy, which are &#39;tamas&#39;, &#39;rajas&#39; and &#39;sattva&#39;. The Puranas, thus, =\r\nsaw her as both, one and many. \nThe abstract principle of Devi&#39;s unity, whi=\r\nch texts like Devi-Mahatmya contemplated, seems to have confined, however, =\r\nto rhetoric and metaphysical discourses alone. Her aniconic verbal concept =\r\nlittle suited the devotional mind and least, a shrine, which had by now a w=\r\nell-evolved tradition of iconic deities. Not in the course of time but in t=\r\nhe very beginning, Devi&#39;s three formal manifestations - Mahakali, Mahalaksh=\r\nmi and Mahasaraswati, were her more accepted forms. Even the Devi-Mahatmya,=\r\n which advanced the principle of Devi&#39;s unity, treated each of her manifest=\r\n forms independently. When personalising these forms, the Devi-Mahatmya con=\r\nceived for each of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati a different set =\r\nof iconic imagery, anatomy, attributes, kind of role and personality type. =\r\nThe Devi-Mahatmya has for each of them an independent &#39;Dhyana&#39;, meditative =\r\nhymn devoted to her. The text also classified into separate chapters the ve=\r\nrses devoted to Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati and their exploits =\r\nagainst evil forces. Not long before, the term &#39;Devi&#39; reduced to a common n=\r\noun, to mean goddess, defining either or all of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi, Maha=\r\nsaraswati and other subsequently evolved deities in different pantheons. \n =\r\n\nThe ten-armed and three-eyed Mahakali has been conceived with ten faces an=\r\nd ten feet. She has a complexion sparkling like a sapphire. She carries in =\r\nher hands sword, discus, mace, spear, bow, iron club, sling, human head and=\r\n conch. In her form as Mahakali, Devi was instrumental in eliminating the d=\r\nemons Madhu and Kaitabha. \n \n \nThe lotus-seated Mahalakshmi has been person=\r\nalised with eighteen hands and the coral-like radiant complexion. She has b=\r\neen conceived as carrying in her hands prayer beads, ax, mace, arrow, thund=\r\nerbolt, staff, lance, sword, shield, conch, bell, wine-cup, trident, noose =\r\nand discus Sudarshana. It is in her form as Mahalakshmi that the Devi kille=\r\nd Mahishasura. \nEffulgent like the moon shining at the edge of a cloud, the=\r\n eight-armed Mahasaraswati has been acclaimed as the support of the three w=\r\norlds. She has been conceived with lotus-like hands and as the one who came=\r\n forth from the body of Gauri to destroy Sumbha and other demons. She holds=\r\n in her hands bell, trident, plough, conch, mace, discus, bow, and arrows. =\r\nThus, whatever her manifest form, the Devi was perceived initially as the d=\r\nestroyer of evil and the promoter of good. \n\nTRANSFORMATION OF DEVI-FORMS I=\r\nN LATER PURANAS\n\nIn later Puranas, the roles of the three Devi-forms, Mahak=\r\nali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati widely changed. The aniconic Devi of the=\r\n Devi-Mahatmya was now iconically realised Devi and demon-slaying attribute=\r\ns of her Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati forms, slaying Mahishasura or Sumbha=\r\n, merged with this new Devi form. She was now the principal demon-slaying g=\r\noddess assuming whatever form, four, eight, ten or eighteen armed, the prev=\r\nailing situation required. This form was known by various names, Mahishasur=\r\na-mardini and Durga being the most prominent among them. Lion was now invar=\r\niably her vehicle. \nMahakali, better known as Kali, was contemplated as one=\r\n of her aspects. For accomplishing an object Devi created Kali out of her o=\r\nwn being. \nShe also created her &#39;shaktis&#39;, subordinate powers. In the cours=\r\ne of time many of these subordinate powers entered the Brahmanical pantheon=\r\n as minor but independent &#39;devis&#39;. \nWith her own distinction Kali soon emer=\r\nged in the devotional mind and tradition of faith as an independent divinit=\r\ny, and even if an aspect of Devi, it was as significant as her Mahishasura-=\r\nMardini, Durga and Parvati forms. In the entire pantheon, Devi came out wit=\r\nh the widest role, most multifarious personality and the largest range of i=\r\nconic and anthropomorphic formations. As Kali she was ferocious, as Durga, =\r\nvalorous, and as Parvati, Uma or Gauri, lovable and incomparably beautiful.=\r\n \nShe represented in her being both light and darkness and destruction and =\r\nsustenance. If black complexioned Kali represented darkness and destruction=\r\n, the gold complexioned Parvati, Uma or Gauri, light and love, and Durga, s=\r\nustenance, which she effected by annihilating evil that sought to destroy l=\r\nife and cosmic order. \n\nTHE DESTROYER\nThe male dominated angle of later Pur=\r\nanas conceived Devi as Shiva&#39;s consort and his feminine aspect. These Puran=\r\nas perceived in Shiva the proto lover and in Uma or Parvati, Devi&#39;s other a=\r\nspect, his creative faculty and timeless love-companion and his half. \nMyth=\r\nically, Parvati was the daughter of Himalayas, and as such, represented hum=\r\nble sublime aspect of creation, which as Himalayas&#39; daughter was her inhere=\r\nnt nature. As Durga, she slew demons and eradicated evil, but different fro=\r\nm the ferocious looking Kali, she has been conceived with a benign look, fe=\r\nminine softness and an abhaya, fearlessness, granting gesture. \nKali, in al=\r\nl forms, Shamshan-Kali, Mahakali, Chandi and others, has been seen as the h=\r\norror-striking destroyer of the universe. \nSevered human heads comprised he=\r\nr garland, skull, her bowl, fresh human blood, her drink, and blood-smeared=\r\n naked sword, her weapon. She roamed in cremation ground and exalted she da=\r\nnced over corpses. \nOf Devi&#39;s all forms Kali has always been the most widel=\r\ny worshipped divinity of Indian masses enshrining altars even in remotest t=\r\nribal hamlets. \nHer role in assisting Devi, Durga of myths, in eliminating =\r\ndemon Rakta-bija is one of the best-known Kali-related legends. Under a boo=\r\nn from Rudra, there grew a new Rakta-bija demon wherever a drop of blood fr=\r\nom the body of Rakta-bija fell. As the Puranas have it, before Rakta-bija b=\r\necame invincible, Durga separated her &#39;tamas&#39;, ferocious aspect and created=\r\n Kali out of it. Kali devoured each drop of Rakta-bija&#39;s blood before it fe=\r\nll on the earth. \nThe demon-slaying aspect of Mahalakshmi was the first to =\r\ndisappear. Such aspect of Mahasaraswati continued for a longer time but not=\r\n with the prior fervour. In her demon-slaying form, she was conceived with =\r\nan iconography identical to Durga, though unlike Durga she wore white costu=\r\nme and had no regular vehicle. This form of Mahasaraswati was widely known =\r\nas Sharda and was highly worshipped in northern and central India during me=\r\ndieval days. Mahakali continued in her demon-slaying role, though the over-=\r\nall Puranic perception in regard to her had largely changed and sometimes w=\r\nidened. She still represented dissolution, destruction, death and decay but=\r\n far more than that she now personified in her being horror, awe and loaths=\r\nomeness. She still slew demons but mostly when summoned by Devi to accompli=\r\nsh an assigned target, and to such extent she was her subordinate. Whatever=\r\n its status in concurrent linguistics, the term &#39;Maha&#39;, which formed first =\r\nhalf of Mahakali, Mahalakshmi and Mahasaraswati, was reduced to a mere adje=\r\nctival suffix and was widely dropped from their names reducing them to Kali=\r\n, Lakshmi and Saraswati. Now the suffix &#39;Maha&#39; was used with their names on=\r\nly rarely to connote a particular form or aspect, not a name in general. \n\n=\r\nTHE SUSTAINER\nNot merely that the adjectival suffix &#39;Maha&#39; was dropped, the=\r\n late concept of Lakshmi was altogether different from the Mahisha-slayer M=\r\nahalakshmi. Lakshmi, a blend of Indus Mother goddess and Vedic &#39;Sita&#39; both =\r\nin iconography and spirit, was conceived as the sustainer, who bestowed bli=\r\nss, prosperity, wealth and material happiness, yielded good crop and abunda=\r\nnt grain and represented magnificence and beauty in life. Lotus, elephant, =\r\npot and a four-armed anatomy emerged as the essential elements of her icono=\r\ngraphy. \n Not an aspect of Devi, Lakshmi was one of the three major female =\r\ndivinities revered alike in Buddhism, Jainism and different Brahmanical sec=\r\nts. \nShe was linked with Vishnu as his consort and feminine aspect that hel=\r\nped him sustain the universe. \nIn the course of time there emerged her othe=\r\nr forms, Padmavati, Gaja-Lakshmi and Mahalakshmi, and names, Shri, Kamala, =\r\nDharini, Vaishnavi, Narayani, Vishnu-priya, Rajalakshmi, Chanchala and so o=\r\nn. \n\nTHE CREATOR\nSaraswati, representing creation, too, emerged as the Divi=\r\nnity independent of Devi and completely different from Mahasaraswati or Sha=\r\nrda. Lotus-seated and swan-riding Saraswati was conceived as the instrument=\r\n using which Brahma rendered creation. She was hence dually perceived in Pu=\r\nranas, first as Brahma&#39;s creation, and hence, his daughter, and, secondly, =\r\nas the feminine component of creation, and hence, his consort. \nShe has bee=\r\nn addressed also as Brahmani, and as such carries most of Brahma&#39;s attribut=\r\nes. She represents supreme wisdom and all-knowing intellect and nourishes a=\r\nll creative faculties, arts, music, dance and literature. Elegantly bejewel=\r\ned and gracefully costumed the four-armed Saraswati carries in her hands vi=\r\nna, book, rosary and pot. Lotus and swan, aspects of her iconography, symbo=\r\nlised purity and chastity, which she symbolised. \n\nRavi.\n\n\n--- In vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;mahalakshmi_gorla&quot; &lt;mahalakshmi_gorla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am doing parayanam of Chandi Path and getting confused wit=\r\nh which goddess took what form and killed whom.
