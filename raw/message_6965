Which is a better way to chant mantras. is chanting loudly (=\r\ni&#39;ve heard that mantras have sound energy) better than silently chanting th=\r\ne mantra in the mind or is it the other way round? I like to silently chant=\r\n and meditate as I live with few other people and don&#39;t want to disturb oth=\r\ners who are not into meditation and spirituality. Kindly clarify.\n\nPramod\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
