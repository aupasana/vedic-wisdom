Care no=\r\nt for doctrines or for dogmas, for sects or for churches. All these count f=\r\nor but little compared with that essence of existence which is in each one,=\r\n and \ncalled &#39;spirituality&#39; . The more this develops in a man, the more pow=\r\nerful is he for good. He who has most of it can do good most to his fellow =\r\nman. First, then, acquire that. Only those who have seen it will understand=\r\n this; but such spirituality can be given to others, even though they be un=\r\nconscious of the gift. Only those who have attained to this power are among=\r\nst the great teachers of mankind. They are the powers of light. Then be you=\r\n this! The more of such men any country produces, the higher that country i=\r\ns raised. That land where no such men exist is doomed. Nothing can save it.=\r\n Therefore, my Master&#39;s message to the world is, `Be ye all spiritual! Get =\r\nye first realization! &#39; And to the young and strong of every country he wou=\r\nld cry that the time is come for renunciation. &#39;Renounce for the sake of hu=\r\nmanity! You have talked of the love of man till the thing is in danger of b=\r\necoming words alone. The time is come to act. The call is now. Do!

To know teh simple truth that that which goes out wil=\r\nl come back to you and that, if you had not been bad at some point, nothing=\r\n bad will ever come to you. For an otherwise ordinary person, following a l=\r\nife based on and being on the right side of=A0karma, is much easier and pro=\r\nfitable=A0 than trying to find that elusive dharma which anyway won&#39;t help =\r\none in the long run.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Just my feeling on the subject.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Much better option\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairav=\r\na - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 7/4/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

It is dangerous to follow someone \n&gt; &gt; &gt; else&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Following the path of dharma basically means engaging in the right \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; action/duty. Right action varies from person to person, from time to t=\r\nime \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and from place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects =\r\nfrom you, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; which in turn is based on who you have been in the past, w=\r\nhat actions you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; did in the past while identifying with the action, w=\r\nho you affected in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; past (and how) with the actions that you iden=\r\ntified with, what debts you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; created in the process, and what mental =\r\ntendencies you accumulated until \n&gt; &gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If, based on one&#39;=\r\ns mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to kill =\r\nevil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.

If, based on=\r\n one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to =\r\nspread the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. =\r\nIf, based on one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants =\r\na person to make a lot of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; money and construct a temple, that becomes=\r\n one&#39;s dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The dharma of a being may change from one life to another.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill h=\r\nis gurus, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; elders and relatives. The time then was such that there wa=\r\ns too much weight \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of=\r\n some weight. Tremendous \n&gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and civilizat=\r\nion destroyed to a great extent, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the to=\r\nne for it. Arjuna being a great warrior, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facili=\r\ntate that. Some people he deeply loved and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; respected were on the oth=\r\ner side and it was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When the same Arju=\r\nna was born again in the 19th century as one of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramaha=\r\nmsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; previous life, =\r\naccording to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; new tim=\r\ne and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; arist=\r\nocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ge=\r\nnerations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; said), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThe tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dh=\r\narma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though =\r\nthe concept \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long t=\r\nime, the concept of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was =\r\na shudra who lived by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maha=\r\nrshi later. Vishwamitra was a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He beca=\r\nme a brahmana and and a maharshi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s =\r\naptitude. One starts off with the varna \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of father, because that is w=\r\nhat one is exposed to in childhood. As one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; develops in life, one get=\r\ns one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpr=\r\netation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you to know your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from =\r\nyour caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the w=\r\norld. Each person has individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dh=\r\narma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure \n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough, one will=\r\n *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind tha=\r\nt tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nois=\r\ne from other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment combining discrim=\r\nination and intuition and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it si=\r\nncerely. We may err, but doing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the best we can is all that we can do=\r\n!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is =\r\nto engage in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; actions without identification. *That* alone ensures th=\r\nat we are not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load.=\r\n We should not build \n&gt; &gt; &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We sh=\r\nould engage in the best \n&gt; &gt; &gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment=\r\n on what our dharma in the given \n&gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with as little attac=\r\nhment and self-identification with the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. When the =\r\naction is finished, we should leave the result \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We should not=\r\n think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Such =\r\nadherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through \n&gt; &gt; &gt; unattached acti=\r\non) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As we=\r\n become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is =\r\nnot easy, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The bot=\r\ntomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engages in action with =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intu=\r\nition are the inputs. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Another external input is the words of scriptu=\r\nres and learned men. One can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A specia=\r\nl place is given to one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders to a s=\r\npiritual master, one can take the words of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the master to determine o=\r\nne&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused =\r\nabout what his dharma was and thought killing gurus \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and relatives wa=\r\ns not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma. Whe=\r\nn Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and=\r\n wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the mat=\r\nerial \n&gt; &gt; &gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One who =\r\nis not in tune with nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ndebts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insi=\r\nght into \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bot=\r\ntomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, fro=\r\nm \n&gt; &gt; &gt; time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrule=\r\ns to find \n&gt; &gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s unders=\r\ntanding of one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma by increasing internal purity. By doing vari=\r\nous kinds of spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging =\r\nin actions without much \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attachment, one can slowly purify oneself an=\r\nd refine one&#39;s understanding of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http:/=\r\n/www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.c=\r\nom/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedic=\r\nAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJag=\r\nan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;da=\r\nhiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups=\r\n. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [ved=\r\nic-wisdom] Dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste to all\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; i just finishe=\r\nd my Aghora series\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and in it in last part\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Vimalanda says path=\r\n of dharma is very personal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Can somebody share views on that and ho=\r\nw can we approach\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; towards it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Does it has to do something with=\r\n vedas and upanishads\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jitender\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From C=\r\nhandigarh to Chennai - find friends all over India.

Care not for =\r\ndoctrines or for dogmas, for sects or for churches. All these count for but=\r\n little compared with that essence of existence which is in each one, and &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;called &#39;spirituality&#39; . The more this develops in a man, the more powerf=\r\nul is he for good. He who has most of it can do good most to his fellow man=\r\n. First, then, acquire that. Only those who have seen it will understand th=\r\nis; but such spirituality can be given to others, even though they be uncon=\r\nscious of the gift. Only those who have attained to this power are amongst =\r\nthe great teachers of mankind. They are the powers of light. Then be you th=\r\nis! The more of such men any country produces, the higher that country is r=\r\naised. That land where no such men exist is doomed. Nothing can save it. Th=\r\nerefore,\n my Master&#39;s message to the world is, `Be ye all spiritual! Get ye=\r\n first realization! &#39; And to the young and strong of every country he would=\r\n cry that the time is come for renunciation. &#39;Renounce for the sake of huma=\r\nnity! You have talked of the love of man till the thing is in danger of bec=\r\noming words alone. The time is come to act. The call is now. Do! Leap into =\r\nthe breach and save the world! &lt;BR&gt;]]]]&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4) in my opinion, what matte=\r\nrs for us is Sadhana, Sadhana and More Sadhana.

So ideally, I don&#39;t think we can eve=\r\nr full perform every dharma that is expected of us. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I believe the reason this idea of Dharma was existent in ancient=\r\n times, was mostly because nature has created various kinds of people, each=\r\n with varying tendencies. This idea of Dharma was sort of approxiamtion, or=\r\n the best way to tell men that we are all different and yet we are not inco=\r\nrrect in anyway.

To know teh simple truth t=\r\nhat that which goes out will come back to you and that, if you had not been=\r\n bad at some point, nothing bad will ever come to you. For an otherwise ord=\r\ninary person, following a life based on and being on the right side of&nbsp=\r\n;karma, is much easier and profitable&nbsp; than trying to find that elusiv=\r\ne dharma which anyway won&#39;t help one in the long run.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; Just my feeling on the subject.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &n=\r\nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Much better option&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 7/4/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

Krishna clearly says in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your own dharma. It is dangerous to follow som=\r\neone &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; else&#39;s dharma&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Following the path of dharma basically means engaging in the right &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; action/duty. Right action varies from person to person, from t=\r\nime to time &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and from place to place. It is dependent on =\r\nwhat nature expects from you, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; which in turn is based on =\r\nwho you have been in the past, what actions you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; did in t=\r\nhe past while identifying with the action, who you affected in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; past (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what d=\r\nebts you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; created in the process, and what mental tendenc=\r\nies you accumulated until\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; now.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; If, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature =\r\nwants a person &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s =\r\ndharma. If, based on one&#39;s mental &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; tendencies and karmic =\r\ndebts, nature wants a person to spread the message of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; un=\r\niformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person =\r\nto spread the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ritual of homam in the world, that becomes=\r\n one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mental tendencies and =\r\nkarmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mon=\r\ney and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The dha=\r\nrma of a being may\n change from one life to another.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to ki=\r\nll his gurus, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; elders and relatives. The time then was su=\r\nch that there was too much weight &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature wa=\r\nnted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tremendous &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; des=\r\ntruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a great extent, &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being=\r\n a great warrior, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. =\r\nSome people he deeply loved and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; respected were on the ot=\r\nher side and it was his dharma to kill them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one of &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had be=\r\nen Arjuna in a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) =\r\n, his dharma\n was different in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; new time and place. =\r\nHe was born to renounce material life despite his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; aristo=\r\ncratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and serv=\r\nice to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; others. When he is born again (which he has to, a=\r\ns per what Ramakrishna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; said), his dharma based on the ti=\r\nme and place may be something else.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky question is: H=\r\now does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own dha=\r\nrma &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of casti=\r\nsm. Though the concept &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been there i=\r\nn\n Hinduism for a long time, the concept of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobili=\r\nty was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was=\r\n a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana a=\r\nnd and a maharshi &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s apt=\r\nitude. One starts off with the varna &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; of father, because =\r\nthat is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; deve=\r\nlops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words whi=\r\nch tells you to know your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wron=\r\ng. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the world. =\r\nEach person has individual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Kno=\r\nwing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure\n &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us hav=\r\ne a part of our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is, b=\r\nut it is surrounded by a lot of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; noise from other parts o=\r\nf our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; confus=\r\ned.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment c=\r\nombining discrimination and intuition and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is=\r\n our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may err, but doing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; the best we can is all that we can do!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage i=\r\nn &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; actions without identification. *That* alone ensures t=\r\nhat we are not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increas=\r\ning the load. We should not build &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; too much attachment to=\r\n what we are doing. We should engage in the best &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n &gt; possib=\r\nle actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with as little attachment and self-identifica=\r\ntion with the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. When the action is fin=\r\nished, we should leave the result &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We should not =\r\nthink &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot;=\r\n etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; unattached action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousne=\r\nss slowly. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharpe=\r\nr and tell our dharma clearer. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There is a positive feedb=\r\nack here. This will slowly enable us to see our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma c=\r\nlearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy, &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not\n following one&#39;s dharma,=\r\n one&#39;s sense of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with ti=\r\nme if one engages in action with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; little attachment.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the i=\r\nnputs. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Another external input is the words of scriptures=\r\n and learned men. One can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them.=\r\n A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; master. If =\r\none surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the words of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his dha=\r\nrma was and thought killing gurus &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and relatives was not =\r\ndharma, he had a guru in Krishna who\n clarified his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; dhar=\r\nma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dharma &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place=\r\n to do sadhana, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevai=\r\nled upon him to stay in the material &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; world and do the wo=\r\nrk of Mother for him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One who is not i=\r\nn tune with nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of w=\r\nhat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul w=\r\nith a clear insight into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru c=\r\nan give perfect guidance.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) c=\r\nannot outline a set of\n principles and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; declare that as t=\r\nhe dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to fi=\r\nnd &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s u=\r\nnderstanding of one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; dharma by increasing internal puri=\r\nty. By doing various kinds of spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana (like ho=\r\nmam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; att=\r\nachment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -----------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Do Pitri\n Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; targ=\r\net=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; =\r\ntarget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.co. in&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@\n yahoogroups. com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSent: Saturday, September 27, 2008 8:02 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedi=\r\nc-wisdom] Dharma&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste to all&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; i just finished my Aghora series&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and in it in last part&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Vimaland=\r\na says path of dharma is very personal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Can somebody =\r\nshare views on that and how can we approach&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; towards i=\r\nt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Does it has to do something with vedas and upanisha=\r\nds&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; jitender&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; From Chandigarh to Chennai - find friends all over I=\r\nndia.
