Krishna knew it from t=\r\nhe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beginning. In the case of Rama, sages like Vasishtha, Vishwamit=\r\nra knew it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even before Rama&#39;s birth, but Rama himself did not know=\r\n it in the beginning. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But he too knew it later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; H=\r\nowever, Krishna had complete mastery over the duality, while Rama did not. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rama had to wade the dual world like normal people. Krishna could =\r\ndo any \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manipulation of the dual world that he wanted.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. ya=\r\nhoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ved=\r\nicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@ yahoo. co.in&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ =\r\nyahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 03, 2009 3:45 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Su=\r\nbject: [vedic-wisdom] Rama as God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In a discussion with another very learned individual, I was told this=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; following statement:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Valmiki had projected=\r\n Ram as a person who tried his level best to live by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; principles.=\r\n He was still not God. Or, at least, he never realised he was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an=\r\n avatar (one who undergoes an &#39;avataran&#39; (coming down to earth to serve \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a specific purpose of the society of his time).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n It was latter day writers like Tulsidas who conferred godhood on Ram.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is this true? Is there any verse in the original Valmiki R=\r\namayana which \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shows divinity (avatarahood) on Rama?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Explore and discover exciting holidays and getaways with=\r\n Yahoo!
