It has been observed that if you place coconu=\r\nt pieces where white portion remains up (pieces rest on dark side) then the=\r\nre are all the chances that pieces may not burnt fully. this is my personal=\r\n experience. so i can suggest few things as under:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Keep Dark=\r\n side up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - Keep the pieces such that they don&#39;t pile on each other.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; - Keep the pieces such a way that it forms a pyramid shape (top of tha=\r\nt shape is opened so that Aahuti can be offered conveniently in that. i mea=\r\nn, there should be a scope for air to pass under the pieces.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I=\r\nt is my experience that coconut peices do get burnt completely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;naaraayana_iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)While doing homam can we move the coconut pi=\r\neces that are there in the havan kund, so that they get burned easily.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i asked it becoz would it be right to poke in the fire with a stick w=\r\nhile we are actually assuming Ganpati is in that fire and the idol at that =\r\ntime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.
