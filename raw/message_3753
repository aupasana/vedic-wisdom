It became the tradition in the Ashram that the\n=\r\nattendants were always young unmarried men. Annamalai Swami reports, =E2=80=\r\n=9COnce,\nwhen a woman who was a qualified nurse from North India volunteere=\r\nd to be an\nattendant, Bhagavan replied by saying, =E2=80=98Ask the people i=\r\nn the Hall=E2=80=99.\nKrishnaswami, the chief attendant, and some of the oth=\r\ner people in the Hall\nobjected. =E2=80=98No! No! We cannot have ladies doin=\r\ng service to Bhagavan. It is\nnot proper.=E2=80=99 Bhagavan turned to the wo=\r\nman and said, =E2=80=98These people all think\nlike this. What can I do?=E2=\r\n=80=99=E2=80=9D\n\nOne of the attendants=E2=80=99 tasks was to receive the fo=\r\nod offerings brought by\ndevotees and give some of it back to them as prasad=\r\nam.They had to be careful\nthat the men sat on one side of the Hall and the =\r\nwomen on the other.\nWhenever Maharshi left the Hall, one of them had to acc=\r\nompany him. The other\none stayed back to clean the Hall. The cloths on the =\r\ncouch had to be kept\nclean. Washing the cloths and preparing warm water for=\r\n the morning bath was\nalso the duty of the attendants, as was accompanying =\r\nRamana on his nightly\nwalks to the toilet. There was, therefore, someone th=\r\nere to be helpful to\nhim round the clock.\n\nMajor Chadwick tells the story o=\r\nf the betel. In this case the attendant=E2=80=99s\nomission resulted in Rama=\r\nna simply giving up chewing betel.=E2=80=9COne morning\nBhagavan was about t=\r\no go out and was only waiting for the attendant to give\nhim the betel, whic=\r\nh was always placed by his side when it was time for his\nwalk. For some rea=\r\nson the attendant did not do it, everybody in the Hall was\nwaiting expectan=\r\ntly but could do nothing about it as the management did not\nallow anybody t=\r\no attend on Bhagavan except those who had been specially\ndetailed. Eventual=\r\nly Bhagavan got up and left the Hall without it. From that\nday on he never =\r\nchewed again.=E2=80=9D\n\nAlthough Sri Ramana could be very strict with his a=\r\nttendants, he was also\nvery concerned for their welfare. In summer, when he=\r\n used to walk to\nPalakothu between midday and 1.30 p.m., the sandy path was=\r\n so hot that\nwalking barefoot could be very painful.Ramana always walked at=\r\n the same\nsteady pace, whether it was raining cats and dogs or whether the =\r\nsun was\nblazing down, but he used to say to the attendant walking behind hi=\r\nm, =E2=80=9CRun,\nrun and take shelter under that tree. Put your upper cloth=\r\n under your feet\nand stand on it for a while.=E2=80=9D\n\nSimilarly Ramana=E2=\r\n=80=99s concern was extended to Rangaswami, when he had to copy\nout several=\r\n pages of a book. =E2=80=9COne day Bhagavan asked me if I had completed\nthe=\r\n job. =E2=80=98I do not have the time for it=E2=80=99, I said. =E2=80=98Wha=\r\nt are you doing now?=E2=80=99\nhe queried. =E2=80=98I am going to Palakothu =\r\nto wash your cod-piece=E2=80=99. Bhagavan said,\n=E2=80=98Okay, you do my jo=\r\nb and I will do yours=E2=80=99, so saying, he copied the\nremaining pages.=\r\n=E2=80=9D\n\nHe insisted that all others had to be served first and that he s=\r\nhould be\nserved last. One day when Suri Nagamma was handing out fruit from =\r\nher nephew\nin the Hall, she served Sri Ramana first, then everybody else. A=\r\nt the end it\nwas found that there was not enough fruit for everyone. So one=\r\n of the\nattendants cut the remaining bananas into small pieces. Ramana said=\r\n\nindignantly, =E2=80=9CThis is what I don=E2=80=99t like. Why do you serve =\r\nwhen you cannot\ngive the same quantity to all people?\n\nThere are lots of di=\r\nning hall stories which make clear how fiercely Maharshi\nresisted any prefe=\r\nrential treatment of his person, as,again and again,\ndevotees tried to serv=\r\ne him a special delicacy or a larger share than\nothers. The cook Santamma a=\r\nlso had to learn her lesson. At the beginning of\nher stay at the Ashram she=\r\n served Sri Ramana an extra portion on his leaf,\nwhich he at once noticed s=\r\naying angrily, =E2=80=9CWhy did you serve the Swami more\nof the curry than =\r\nthe rest? Have you come all the way here to learn this? If\nyou serve more t=\r\no others and less to me I would be happy. Do you want to\npurchase grace by =\r\nserving extra? If you show the devotees the same love as\nyou have for me, t=\r\nhen your love for me too will grow.=E2=80=9D\n\nFor the Brahmins=E2=80=99 sak=\r\nes a certain importance was attached to the observation\nof caste rules. Bra=\r\nhmins are only allowed to eat together with members of\ntheir own caste. To =\r\nenable them to obey this rule the dining hall was\nseparated in two by a bam=\r\nboo screen.On the one side the Brahmins had their\nplace, on the other side =\r\nthe non-Brahmins. Sri Ramana sat in the opening of\nthe screen on the non-Br=\r\nahmin side and was visible to all. Again and again\nBrahmins tried to sit on=\r\n the non-Brahmin side and circumvent their own caste\nrules in the Ashram. T=\r\nhey argued that with Ramana there were no caste\ndifferences. But he did not=\r\n accept their arguments as long as they continued\nto apply caste rules at h=\r\nome.\n\nSource: Ramana Maharshi: His Life A biography by Gabriele Ebert\n\n-- \n=\r\n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=\r\n=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd292805e0717047fef9e02\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\nSri Ramana=E2=80=99s personal attendants were chosen by Chinnaswami.Ramana =\r\nhimself never asked anyone to serve him, nor ever sent away an attendant wh=\r\no had been allotted to him.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;It became=\r\n the tradition in the Ashram that the attendants were always young unmarrie=\r\nd men.
