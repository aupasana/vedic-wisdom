Tantra basically means a proc=\r\nedure. Different rituals have \ndifferent \n&gt; procedures. Some are more elabo=\r\nrate and some are simple. But there \nis a \n&gt; tantra in every ritual.\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\nhether a ritual is saattwik or raajasik or taamasik is decided by \nthe \n&gt; a=\r\nttitude and thinking involved and not based on the deity or the \nprocedure =\r\n\n&gt; alone.\n&gt; \n&gt; Choice of deity based on horoscope is for bhakti yoga. Howev=\r\ner, \nour \n&gt; understanding of Jyotisha is imperfect. Sometimes, we give a wr=\r\nong \nadvice. \n&gt; But, in this case, wrong advice is not catastrophic. If a s=\r\neeker \nis sincere, \n&gt; he will eventually find the right direction.\n&gt; \n&gt; A s=\r\nadguru is far more useful than astrology to show the correct \ndirection in =\r\n\n&gt; which one makes quick progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do Ganapathi =\r\nHomam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality: http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://v=\r\nedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan=\r\nnath.org\n&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@..=\r\n.&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 17, 2008 1:=\r\n36 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] mantras\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; namaste  to all\n&gt; &gt; i wan=\r\nted to ask that when do certain upayas in jyotish are they \na part\n&gt; &gt; of t=\r\nantra also or what\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; and another thing i wanted to ask is\n&gt; &gt; as nara=\r\nsimha ji mentioned in his book integrated approach vedic\n&gt; &gt; astrology (in =\r\nthe chapter regarding vedic remedies)that a \njyotishi has\n&gt; &gt; to choose a p=\r\narticular god on the basis of knowledge of vedic \nstudies\n&gt; &gt; for a native =\r\nwhose chart is being studied to help him grow\n&gt; &gt; spiriyually   then it is =\r\nRAJAYOGA or BHAKTI YOGA\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; jitender\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
