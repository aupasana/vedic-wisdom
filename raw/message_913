The event of eclipse, in which Rahu and Ketu trouble Sun \nand Moon, is not conducive to dharma, i.e. adherence to the rules of \nengagement in the field of duality.\n\nBut it is conducive to spiritual experience of the underlying single reality \nwhere there is no duality (no god, no demon, no good, no bad). Torturing of \nSun and Moon by Ketu is conducive to moksha. The eyes of the cosmic being, \nthrough which the variety of beings in this creation is observed, need to be \nclosed in order to get out of the field of duality and become absorbed in \nBrahman.\n\nAt the time of eclipses, temples close and priests do not do temple rituals. \nHowever, for individual sadhana for spiritual progress, it is a great time. \nSome say that japam and homam done at the time of a homam gives 1000 times \nmore result.\n\nIf you are doing a homam for spiritual progress, eclipse time is a great \ntime to do homam.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, January 11, 2009 1:16 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Eclipse\n\n\n&gt; Respected Members\n&gt;\n&gt; Can someone please post something about the eclipse.
