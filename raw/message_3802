The idea is that one is n=\r\not bound by Maayaa once one *fully* understands \n&gt; &gt; and appreciates it.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Chandipath consists of symbolic stories of wars \n&gt; &gt; that the divin=\r\ne Mother fought, which explain how one can fight and overcome \n&gt; &gt; various =\r\nweaknesses that typically bind one in Maayaa. Reciting these stories on \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; a regular basis will promote the fighting spirit within one that fights t=\r\nhese \n&gt; &gt; weaknesses.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; There is nothing wrong in understanding Maa=\r\nyaa and \n&gt; &gt; trying to fight/overcome it at the same time. One aspect of th=\r\ne Mother creates \n&gt; &gt; Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you experience=\r\n good and bad in that \n&gt; &gt; Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you under=\r\nstand Maayaa to overcome it. One \n&gt; &gt; aspect of the Mother makes you fight =\r\nand overcome it. When one realizes Self at \n&gt; &gt; the end, irrespective of th=\r\ne path taken, one finally sees that all these are \n&gt; &gt; aspects of a Single =\r\nMother who is also essentially true Self.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        \n&gt; &gt; *        =\r\n*\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I have started to read the Aghora series \n&gt; &gt; books by =\r\nDr. Robert\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings \n&gt; &gt; on the s=\r\nubject.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I need to read more! \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Aghora series books b=\r\ny Svoboda are good, but Aghora \n&gt; &gt; is not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. It is nor=\r\nmal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;n=\r\not terrible&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; One of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true Aghora =\r\n(aghori) does not \n&gt; &gt; see anything as terrible or bad or impure and sees a=\r\nll as impermanent \n&gt; &gt; manifestations of god and tries to focus the thinkin=\r\ng of the mind on what is \n&gt; &gt; permanent (god) always, instead of impermanen=\r\nt manifestations of \n&gt; &gt; god.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; When someone dies, north Indians ch=\r\nant &quot;Raama naam \n&gt; &gt; satya hai&quot; while carrying the dead body to the funeral=\r\n. It means &quot;only the name \n&gt; &gt; of Lord Rama is true and everything else is =\r\nan illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind \n&gt; &gt; oneself that life and death are ju=\r\nst a temporary illusion and only the Lord is \n&gt; &gt; real. But the question is=\r\n: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth \n&gt; &gt; only when some=\r\none dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thing we \n&gt; &gt; have=\r\n done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ourselves \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are temporary \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want to ge=\r\nt it, \n&gt; &gt; can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that s=\r\neems beautiful \n&gt; &gt; and other things that seem not so beautiful are tempora=\r\nry illusions. Only the \n&gt; &gt; Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on tempora=\r\nry illusions&quot;? When someone \n&gt; &gt; attacks and abuses us and we are about to =\r\nfeel sad or angry, can&#39;t we tell \n&gt; &gt; ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. Thes=\r\ne abuses are temporary illusions. Only the \n&gt; &gt; Lord is real. Let the mind =\r\nnot dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;=\r\nRaama naam satya hai&quot; \n&gt; &gt; always. His mind rejects all *impermanent manife=\r\nstations* of Lord (instead of \n&gt; &gt; *dwelling* on them by classifying them a=\r\ns pure and impure, good and bad etc and \n&gt; &gt; thinking about them with attra=\r\nction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on \n&gt; &gt; what is permanent. But=\r\n he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        \n&gt; &gt; *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Veda=\r\nnta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive \n&gt; &gt; is an illusion&quot;. An agh=\r\nora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both \n&gt; &gt; impermenant il=\r\nlusions and the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he \n&gt; &gt; que=\r\nstions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where fec=\r\nes \n&gt; &gt; is eaten. But, please remember that eating \n&gt; &gt; feces is not the ma=\r\nin point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not \n&gt; &gt; perceivin=\r\ng an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n point. For example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such =\r\na \n&gt; &gt; person&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self (=\r\n&quot;feces&quot;) \n&gt; &gt; while eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but=\r\n the mind will not \n&gt; &gt; be dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; w=\r\nith certain properties and \n&gt; &gt; will not feel any kind of disgust. He will =\r\nbe thinking that he is Self and he is \n&gt; &gt; eating Self.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Of course=\r\n, a vedantin also has the same notions \n&gt; &gt; really. He chants vedic verses =\r\nwhen eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am \n&gt; &gt; Self and I am consuming=\r\n Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a \n&gt; &gt; ritual and not be =\r\nfully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may \n&gt; &gt; dwell on th=\r\ne impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly \n&gt; &gt; cooked=\r\n brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; the permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are tel=\r\nling \n&gt; &gt; themselves the same truth and trying to absorb that truth into ev=\r\nery thought and \n&gt; &gt; impulse. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme s=\r\nituation where failure \n&gt; &gt; results in a very bad dual experience. That can=\r\n in fact work as an incentive in \n&gt; &gt; forcing one to transcend duality! In =\r\nthe case of a person who chants a Vedic \n&gt; &gt; verse that says &quot;I am Self and=\r\n I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and \n&gt; &gt; nicely made food, the =\r\nfallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while \n&gt; &gt; eating is not to=\r\no bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) \n&gt; &gt; taste of a=\r\n laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be s=\r\no \n&gt; &gt; disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual e=\r\nxperience \n&gt; &gt; may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; How=\r\never, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be \n&gt; &gt; accomplished by everyone m=\r\nerely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying \n&gt; &gt; Aghora sadhanas suc=\r\nceeds.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        \n&gt; &gt; *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Take another simple exa=\r\nmple. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, \n&gt; &gt; like japam and homam,=\r\n and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is \n&gt; &gt; dwelling on =\r\nsex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is \n&gt; &gt; ca=\r\nusing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; A regular person will try=\r\n to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away from \n&gt; &gt; sexual thoughts. But =\r\nthat is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts. After \n&gt; &gt; all, such th=\r\noughts may still come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy \n&gt; &gt; for=\r\n 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does not =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fascination so=\r\nme minds \n&gt; &gt; may have for sex?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an extr=\r\neme. He will try to fix the root cause and \n&gt; &gt; remove fascination from the=\r\n mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two \n&gt; &gt; different activities =\r\n(one pure and the other impure), he may combine them into \n&gt; &gt; one without =\r\nsuch distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked \n&gt; &gt; with=\r\n his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam. In the \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nbeginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think that his sadh=\r\nana \n&gt; &gt; is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like th=\r\nat for several \n&gt; &gt; months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He =\r\nmay no longer feel that \n&gt; &gt; he is doing something impure. He may no longer=\r\n feel titillation. The association \n&gt; &gt; in his mind between nakedness and s=\r\nex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures \n&gt; &gt; physically or mentally ma=\r\ny no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts \n&gt; &gt; of meditation. A=\r\nny small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head \n&gt; &gt; may no=\r\nt lead to denser and denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spendin=\r\ng so \n&gt; &gt; much time in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attra=\r\nction and \n&gt; &gt; thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken=\r\n down. Overall, the \n&gt; &gt; person&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may be g=\r\none largely.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experi=\r\nences and the thoughts \n&gt; &gt; we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to br=\r\neak down some of these structures \n&gt; &gt; by engaging in certain practices tha=\r\nt undermine those structures.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, is this a fool-proof metho=\r\nd? Not really. It is also possible that \n&gt; &gt; the person keeps on engaging i=\r\nn the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex \n&gt; &gt; everytime he sits for =\r\nmeditation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he \n&gt; &gt; sees naked =\r\npartner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; * =\r\n       \n&gt; &gt; *        *\n&gt; &gt;  Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and=\r\n weaknesses head \n&gt; &gt; on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas=\r\n a normal person may push \n&gt; &gt; the problems under the carpet and fight slow=\r\nly and with low stakes. Such a risky \n&gt; &gt; strategy is not applicable to all=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        \n&gt; &gt; *        *\n&gt; &gt;  Like Manish said in a mail earlie=\r\nr, &quot;what is Vedanta and what \n&gt; &gt; is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical =\r\nway to understand and absorb Vedanta in \n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s thought process, by sett=\r\ning up a high stakes war plan. However, it is \n&gt; &gt; certainly not suitable f=\r\nor all and many may feel aversion. More dangerously, \n&gt; &gt; some people may f=\r\neel attraction for it based on a wrong understanding and the \n&gt; &gt; thrill su=\r\nch an understanding brings. Aghora stands for neither thrills nor \n&gt; &gt; perv=\r\nersion, though it *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or \n&gt; &gt; pe=\r\nrversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, b=\r\nut \n&gt; &gt; Aghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs the truth into one&#39;s th=\r\ninking by \n&gt; &gt; making failure very unpleasant.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; BTW, the following=\r\n mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths \n&gt; &gt; and explains th=\r\ne basic reality.

But what I am trying to u=\r\nnderstand is that \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        how to worship both forms simultaneously. F=\r\nor instance, Sri \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great compose=\r\nr (one of the Divine Trinity \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        of Carnatic Music along with Thy=\r\nagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who was a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        self-realized Sri Vidyo=\r\npasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        Krithis mention great details=\r\n about all the nine avaranas \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        and different forms of the divin=\r\ne mother as one goes through each \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        avarana. In the Dhyana Krit=\r\nhi of those, in the very first \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        line he says, &#39;Kamalambike, As=\r\nRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;. That line \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        tells me that even thro=\r\nugh Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        that form. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt;So my question was in that perspective. Anyway, your reply was a \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;        great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by l=\r\nayers of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        duality! I never thought in those terms. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;I have started reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n      reading it fluently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I plan =\r\nto \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        do during navaratri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get c=\r\nomfortable \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        reading the saptashati! Have to see how mother wil=\r\nl help me achieve my \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        target. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;Also, I have starte=\r\nd to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert \n&gt; &gt; &gt;        Svobodha. For=\r\n now I have very mixed feelings on the subject.

My \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;   =\r\n       performing a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspiring. O=\r\nn \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          the other hand, there are some people who do not know Sa=\r\nnskrit at all \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with gre=\r\nat difficulty in their \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          first attempt. THEY are doing Chand=\r\ni homam everyday and it takes them \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          1.5 hours now. THAT is =\r\nawe-inspiring.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Integrating various \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          sadhanas i=\r\ns a personal problem that needs a personal solution. In \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          ge=\r\nneral, it is a good idea to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;  =\r\n        the time spent on them, instead of splitting the time between ten \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better to di=\r\ng 10 metres \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          in one place rather than dig one metre in ten =\r\nplaces, if one wants to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          find water.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;One possi=\r\nbility is to do a homam and then meditate \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          at the end after=\r\n poornaahuti with various mantras one is attached \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          to.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, from \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n          the little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;          representation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its p=\r\nurpose, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          too, is to unravel the layer of duality and realiz=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Lalita means gentle one and Chandi me=\r\nans the fierce one. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          If you have a mother who teaches you g=\r\nently, you will learn slowly. If \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          you have a mother who is =\r\nstern and strict, you will learn fast \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          (provided you can fa=\r\nce the strictness). Both are valid \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Bes=\r\nt regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;------------ --------- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Free Jyotish Software, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;          Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; r=\r\nitual \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Films that make a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          diffe=\r\nrence: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.=\r\ncom/ group/vedic- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Jyotish writings: http://gr=\r\noups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          tings\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;------------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;--- On Fri, 2/5/10, nagraj@sbcglobal. net &gt;&gt;          &lt;nagraj_um@ya=\r\nhoo. com&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;From: nagraj@sbcglobal. net =\r\n&gt;&gt;          &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Subject: [vedic-w=\r\nisdom] Chandi Homam and Sri \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          Vidya\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Date: Friday, February 5, 2010, 11:=\r\n51 \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;I am very much in awe \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          after I learnt that you do chandi =\r\nhomam everyday. You also wrote that \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          it takes about 1.25 ho=\r\nurs to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          can you acco=\r\nmplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          Als=\r\no, in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          m=\r\ninutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n          Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I som=\r\netimes do \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          special rituals several times a week, that takes=\r\n about 1 to 1.5 hours \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          in all. How to integrate these along=\r\n with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          different from Chandi homa=\r\nm? Could you please explain what is sri \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          Vidya and how it i=\r\ns to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          the Devi=\r\n Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in Sri \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;      =\r\n    Vidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;          krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;Nagraj \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;          Kota\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
