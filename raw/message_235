In=\r\n the Shrividya worship of the goddess , We even find \nDhumavathi , Bhagalam=\r\nukhi and Smashantaara...I have read previous \nexplanations of Sanjay ji and=\r\n other SJC gurus giving one form of \ninterpretation of Smashaan tara as Bha=\r\nva Taarini(one who takes us \nacross the ocean of the world ) ...\n\nYet the f=\r\norm of the goddess itself is awe and fear inspiring....but \nto sever the mo=\r\nre grosser afflictions like lust and \nanger ...probably feel the great kind=\r\n mother has taken various \nforms...\n\n\nThe question I have specifically is t=\r\nhis..just like a child who \nplays with fire...If a devotee chooses the ugra=\r\n roopa of the goddes \nbut still prays with a sincere heart...will he still =\r\nbe punished by \na misprounciation of the mantras.\n\n\n\n2.My second question i=\r\ns related to the first one....Right from the \nPancharatra school of worship=\r\n system followed in major temples in \nIndia ...Which is one the factor that=\r\n gives strength to Prayer..\n\nIs it emotion that gives strength and directio=\r\nn to prayer...or is it \nthe proper prounciation ,gotra pravara information =\r\nand the strict \nrules...\n\n\nIf a devotee is very sincere but does not know t=\r\nhe proper rules , by \ntaking part in a puja method involving bija mantras w=\r\nill he still \nget the benefit.\n\n\n\n3.The third question is with respect to V=\r\nimalananda and the Aghora \nbooks ....I agree with you they have been writte=\r\nn by a rishi , but \none doubt keeps on nagging my mind.\n\nDr Robert Svoboda =\r\nwho is also on the academic list of the American \nAyurvedic Institute in Ne=\r\nw Mexico serving along with Dr Vasant lad \nwho is a respected name in Ayurv=\r\neda in America styled this books on \nthe style of carlos castaneda , castan=\r\neda&#39;s books are very popular , \ntake a similar cryptic style of teaching wh=\r\nere is suddenly abducted \nby a mexican shaman...Svoboda even refers to this=\r\n fact in the \npreface where he does not explicity say it is true or false :=\r\n) he \nleaves it to the readers.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carlos_Castan=\r\neda\n\n\nComing back to my questions...Most of the theory in the books seems \n=\r\nvery well grounded....\n\nBut many examples do not seem to tally .....\n\n1.In =\r\nthe book on karma he gives the example of a snake eaten by a \nthousand ants=\r\n which are again reborn as a fisherman at whose hands \nthose thousand ants =\r\nnow reborn as fish die...\n\n:) But animals do not accumulate karma since the=\r\ny are only following \ntheir nature ......\n\n\n2.He gives the example of Akbar=\r\n (have followed the previous messages)\n\nAkbar might have been a huge depart=\r\nure from his bloodthirsty \nancestors.\n\n1.So was Hemu the hindu king who fou=\r\nght valiantly...it was only a \nstroke of luck that delivered the throne to =\r\nAkbar.Some of the more \nbalanced historians have written of the battle (R C=\r\n Majumdar for \nexample in his book History of the mughals) \n\n2.Akbar for al=\r\nl his magnanimity never got one of his daughters \nmarried in reverse to the=\r\n rajputs.\n\n\n3.Jiziyah was still not lifted in akbar&#39;s regime ...only the pi=\r\nlgrim \ntax was abolished.\n\n\n4.Rana Pratap the bravest of the brave fought a=\r\nkbar all his \nlife...he fought for the people of mewar not for his personal=\r\n pride.\n\n:) Akabar could not defeat Rana pratap even after 30 yrs...\n\nNow i=\r\nn my eyes Rana Pratap was a true king ...much more kind , much \nmore brave =\r\n.\n\n\n\n\nStill Vimalananda praises him in the book....The book no doubt has \nm=\r\nany gems but still attempts a very simiplistic explanation of \nkarma .\n\nI c=\r\nan understand from a pure point of historical interest , the nath \npanthis =\r\nwere always outside society , in the 1500,1600 ,1700 era \nthey mixed freely=\r\n with the sufis so can understand the influence and \nacceptance .....\n\n\nI m=\r\night differ strongly on the historical questions which anyhow \nwould not be=\r\n relevant to this group ,a lot of proof can be furnished \non rana pratap an=\r\nd his battles with akbar but that would be an \naltogether different topic ,=\r\n my primary focus was maybe the books \nhave to be taken with a pinch of sal=\r\nt...\n\n\n\n\n\nBut the rest would be more than willing to learn from the group .=\r\n\n\n\n\n\nRegards\nVivek\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
