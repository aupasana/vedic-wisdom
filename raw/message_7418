At that event, Manish Pandit saw the same eight S=\r\niddhas who had earlier come in his dream. They were meditating on the premi=\r\nses of the Kalikambal temple!&quot;\n\nWhy did Siddas appear in the premsises of t=\r\nhe Kalikambal temple? Are these Siddhas belongs to native or kind of celest=\r\nial beings. Did they have any message again to pass on to Manish ji? Did Ma=\r\nnishji get chance to speak with them? Have you seen these Siddas?\n\nOut of c=\r\nurio i am asking, Please reply if you feel worth to answer.\n\nThank you,\nSri=\r\nni.\n\n\n\n\n"}}
