The question of what constitutes the proper derivation=\r\n of religious authority is one of the most important, and one of the most c=\r\nontentious, issues in the realm of religious and philosophical debate. To g=\r\nreater or lesser extents (though definitely mostly greater), every religiou=\r\ns sect, spiritual tradition, denomination, school of philosophy, and spirit=\r\nual leader makes the claim of having access to the truth. Indeed, for most =\r\nreligious and philosophical systems, whether religious and secular in world=\r\n-view, it is claimed, either overtly or else by obvious implication, that t=\r\nheirs is the only direct and sure means for knowing truth. Whether we speak=\r\n of Judaism, Christianity, Islam, Buddhism, Hinduism, Marxism, Science, Ath=\r\neism, or any system of thought on earth, every philosophical system claims =\r\nthat they, and only they, are in a position of bestowing truth. &quot;Only we ha=\r\nve access to the real Truth&quot;, every religious teacher claims. As a direct r=\r\nesult of such competing truth-claims, coupled with the natural variance of =\r\nsuch claims that results from multiple individuals claiming to know truth, =\r\nwe have witnessed several millennia of religious and philosophical contenti=\r\non. \n\nWhile every philosophy can attempt to claim that theirs is the only p=\r\nath to truth, however, before we can even approach the question of what dif=\r\nfering religions claim, and thus begin the process of philosophical assessm=\r\nent of these claims, first we need to answer the fundamental question of ho=\r\nw any religion can even claim to know the truth at all. For those religions=\r\n that claim to be revealing the nature of the Absolute, how is it even poss=\r\nible for the Absolute, which is infinite, to be understood by finite humans=\r\n? Before we can claim to know God, first we need to grapple with the proble=\r\nm of the very possibility of knowing God at all. The question of &quot;how can w=\r\ne claim to know anything at all?&quot; is the domain of the field of epistemolog=\r\ny, or the science of human knowledge, cognition and perception. \n\nThe scope=\r\n of the present work is not to attempt to put an end to all religious conte=\r\nntion, nor to necessarily insist on a conclusive proof that one system of r=\r\neligious/philosophical thought is in some way superior to all others. Rathe=\r\nr it is my desire that this book will greatly add to a larger general under=\r\nstanding of the basic issues of derivation of religious authority as these =\r\nissues pertain specifically to the realm of epistemology, or the systematic=\r\n study of the nature of knowing. The focus of this work is centered upon th=\r\ne little studied, and even less understood, school of Vedic epistemology. T=\r\nhough it is undoubtedly one of the most ancient systems in the world dedica=\r\nted to the study of knowledge derivation, Vedic epistemology is a developme=\r\nnt in the history of philosophy that has been routinely neglected as a fiel=\r\nd of serious study by the majority of both academic observers of the histor=\r\ny and philosophy of religion, as well as by most Hindu leaders, seekers and=\r\n lay-persons. It is my hope that this work will mark the beginning of a gre=\r\nater interest in this fascinating subject.\n\nMy book focuses directly on iss=\r\nues of epistemology, as well as determining the philosophical bounds of spi=\r\nritual knowledge. Specifically, I undertake a comparative analysis of the p=\r\nerceptual processes utilized to derive knowledge of ontologically transmate=\r\nrial realities (God, soul, etc.) in the philosophical systems of Hinduism, =\r\nBuddhism, and the whole of the Western philosophical tradition (with specia=\r\nl emphasis on Plato, Augustine and Anselm). While the ultimate goal of my b=\r\nook is conducting an examination of Vedic epistemology per se, I am purpose=\r\nfully centering the focus of this book on the theories of the 16th Century =\r\nphilosopher, Jiva Gosvami. Jiva Gosvami&#39;s epistemological theories represen=\r\nt an interesting approach in the long history of South Asian religion relat=\r\nive to the question of what, precisely, constitutes authoritative knowledge=\r\n. In many ways, Jiva both personifies radical orthodoxy, while simultaneous=\r\nly being a very original thinker. \n\nI decided to focus on the epistemologic=\r\nal ideas of this specific philosopher because his epistemological teachings=\r\n serve as a highly representative axial milieu around which to understand b=\r\noth the full scope of Hindu epistemology, as well as many of the specific i=\r\nssues and implications that arise from this subject. \n\nUnlike the majority =\r\nof Hindu philosophers, Jiva Gosvami (c.1511-c.1596) feels that the smrti li=\r\nterature is more authoritative than shruti, and thus rests the basis of his=\r\n epistemology, not on the Vedas, but on the Purana literature. Additionally=\r\n, he takes the rather unusual approach of accepting ten distinct ways of kn=\r\nowing (pramanas) as all being epistemically authoritative. Despite the fact=\r\n that Jiva Gosvami&#39;s philosophical theories represent a somewhat unique app=\r\nroach to the field of Hindu epistemology, very sparse research has thus far=\r\n been attempted in the Western world on this Indian thinker. \n\nI have sever=\r\nal aims in this present work. First, since Jiva Gosvami represents a school=\r\n of thought relatively unknown in the Western world, I will present an outl=\r\nine of his epistemological theories and place them within the greater conte=\r\nxt of Indian philosophy. This will be accomplished by surveying his theorie=\r\ns as contained in his two most important works: Tattva-sandarbha and his au=\r\ntocommentary on the same, the Sarva-samvadini. Second, I will analyze and c=\r\nritique his arguments from a philosophical perspective using propositional,=\r\n comparative, and veridical analyses. Third, I will explore the significanc=\r\ne of Jiva Gosvami&#39;s ideas for Vedanta. Lastly, I will speak about the immen=\r\nse implications of these epistemological theories for the future of epistem=\r\nology and philosophy of religion. \n\nAgain, employing Jiva Gosvami&#39;s ideas a=\r\ns a philosophical anchor and as a backdrop for the cultural milieu that rep=\r\nresented the historical height of inter-philosophical epistemological debat=\r\ne, the ultimate goal of this work is actually to present the profound insig=\r\nhts and practical efficacy of the Vedic way of knowing God. \n\nThough this m=\r\nay seem at first glance to be a rigidly academic work, it is my hope that a=\r\ncademic scholars will, in actuality, serve as only a secondary audience for=\r\n this work. My primary audience are those sincere spiritual practitioners, =\r\nyogis and yoginis, dedicated Hindus, and followers of Sanatana Dharma globa=\r\nlly who wish to have a more thorough understanding of precisely what it mea=\r\nns to know God in the Vedic tradition, and to thus deepen their own experie=\r\nnce of the presence of God in their everyday lives. \n\nAs I hope this work w=\r\nill make abundantly clear, God is not merely an interesting idea designed t=\r\no serve as the theoretical kindling of fueled academic debate. Rather, God =\r\nis the grounding ontological principle that makes all conceptual and percep=\r\ntual activities on the part of all human beings even possible. It is, indee=\r\nd, in knowing the Absolute that we have access to knowing absolute knowledg=\r\ne. \n\nThe Vedic path powerfully reveals to us the fact that God is very much=\r\n real.\n\nMoreover, as this book systematically and thoroughly explains, it i=\r\ns through the Vedic path that God can be intimately known.\n\nDharma Pravarta=\r\nka Acharya \n(Dr. Frank Morales, Ph.D.)\nThe Center for Dharma Studies\nIntern=\r\national Sanatana Dharma Society\nOmaha, Nebraska, U.S.A.\nJanuary, 2010\n\n\n\n&quot;T=\r\nhe Vedic Way of Knowing God&quot;, by Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya, is availabl=\r\ne for purchase here:\n\n\nhttp://www.dharmacentral.com/dharmastore/Vedic_Way_o=\r\nf_Knowing_God.php\n\n\nGive the gift of Dharma this holiday season. 5% Discoun=\r\nt if you purchase now!\n\n\nRevealing the profound philosophical insights of t=\r\nhe world&#39;s most ancient spiritual philosophy, this book not only boldly ans=\r\nwers the question &quot;How do I know God?&quot; from the distinctly Vedic (Hindu) pe=\r\nrspective, but also explores the further issues of what it even means to be=\r\n able to know God.
