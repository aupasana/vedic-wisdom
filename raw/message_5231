I am a strong believer that\n pra=\r\nyers to the Almighty are the ultimate answers to things not in our control.=\r\n Thank you for sharing this simple mantras with the readers; literally hund=\r\nreds would benefit from this as they seek their solace. Bhakti is what make=\r\ns people focus more on internal strengths (of individuals) and become stron=\r\nger to overcome difficulties.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am student/have been a student =\r\nof Astrology for 20+ years, and continue to use it for guidance for the fut=\r\nure, but do not expect predictions would come true as there are factorial 1=\r\n2! x 9! factorial permutations and combinations to deal with, virtually mak=\r\ning it impossible to predict correctly. But for a trained eye and the learn=\r\ned gurus, and for those who have focused more on the good lord to seek the =\r\nknowledge (with total discipline and in submitting to the Lord unconditiona=\r\nlly), this art becomes a science as they acquire &quot;vak-suddhi&quot;;\n AND they ar=\r\ne able to guide the people. I see many in this group following such discipl=\r\nine and thanks to them. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While this wonderful help is available=\r\n, I still think we need to give the members something to focus on the Lord =\r\nin terms of mantras like you have done Mr. Jay-ji. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it possi=\r\nble, Jay-ji, that we have a few simple mantras listed for the benefit of th=\r\ne members to address the common issues people face, plus to appease the lor=\r\nds of the houses (like Ganesha for ketu, Durga for rahu, Balaji for saturn =\r\netc). Mr. PVRji has listed some, but would be good to develop such list and=\r\n make them available in one place. I truly believe that would be more usefu=\r\nl and powerful than prescribing remedies which may or may not work(with pos=\r\nsible high degree of error possibilities in the charts).\n Bhakti and medita=\r\ntion always would work!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If Mr. PVR or other gurujis are reading=\r\n this, I would appreciate it if they take the leadership to develop such ma=\r\nntras and circulate for the benefit of the members.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank you v=\r\nery much!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; With deep regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; Murthy Divakaruni&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc510.mai=\r\nl.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_bl=\r\nank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-astrology%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;ved=\r\nic-astrology@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;jkumarkb&quot; &lt;jkumarkb@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear All,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chant the below mantra at =\r\nleast 108 times everyday with deep belief and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dedication.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajagopala Mantram&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna Krishna Mah=C3=83?=C3=A2??=C3=83?=C3=82yogin&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakt=C3=83?=C3=A2??=C3=83?=C3=\r\n=82n=C3=83?=C3=A2??=C3=83?=C3=82m Abhayam Kara&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Govinda Param=C3=83?=C3=A2??=C3=83?=C3=82nanda&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sarvam Me Vasha M=C3=83?=C3=A2??=C3=\r\n=83?=C3=82na Ya !!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Translation:- Krishna, oh great Yo=\r\ngi, you give shelter to your devotees.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Oh Govinda, You are the giver of Supreme Bliss.
