At one stage, you said &quot;Ahamkara isn&#39;t the dominant cause of I-ness in=\r\n Astral/Causal bodies&quot;, while I was saying ahamkara=3DI-ness. Now, you wrot=\r\ne:\n\n&gt; PHYSICAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA) =3D ASMITA =3D Physical Egotism\n&gt; ASTRAL I=\r\n-NESS (AHAMKARA) =3D MANAS =3D Astral attachments\n&gt; CAUSAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA=\r\n) =3D CHITTA =3D Causal Perceptions\n\nSo you are acknowledging that I-ness a=\r\nnd ahamkara are synonyms and referring to ahamkara at astral and causal pla=\r\nnes. It is good that you are slowly converging!\n\n* * *\n\nI did not want to d=\r\nivert from the upanishadic terminology of 19 ideas of individualized consci=\r\nousness. So I stuck to the term ahamkaara and ignored your references to Pa=\r\ntanjali. Now that there is some convergence on &quot;ahamkaara&quot;, let me address =\r\n&quot;asmita&quot; mentioned in Patanjali yoga sutras.\n\n&gt; identification of the seer =\r\nwith the instrument of\n&gt; seeing i.e. Physical senses.\n\nYou are assuming tha=\r\nt physical senses or physical body is the only instrument of seeing (or exp=\r\neriencing) .\n\nHowever, mind can see, hear, feel and experience things even =\r\nwhen it is not working with a physical body and physical senses. For exampl=\r\ne, one&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; something in a dream without the physical eyes seei=\r\nng anything.\n\nAlso, a yogi in deep meditation may see, hear, feel or experi=\r\nence something without the involvement of eyes, ears and other physical sen=\r\nses.\n\nIf such a yogi identifies with the instrument of that experience, i.e=\r\n. the mind, that too is asmita as per Patanjali&#39;s yoga sutra that you quote=\r\nd. Just as I had an issue earlier with your limiting of ahamkaara to physic=\r\nal body, I also have an issue with your limiting of asmita to physical body=\r\n.\n\nBTW, identification with physical body *as well as* identification with =\r\nmind block one from yoga (communion) with true Self. Both are due to ahamka=\r\nara as defined by upanishads. Both are due to asmita as defined by Patanjal=\r\ni.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.or=\r\ng/ homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpa=\r\nna\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish=\r\n lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.=\r\n yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http=\r\n://www.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- -\n\n---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; || OM TA=\r\nT SAT ||\n&gt; Dear Utpalji and Narasimha,\n&gt; \n&gt; If any of you is offended due t=\r\no my being explicit with words - it also shows that you people have a lot o=\r\nf scope in learning of new ideas!\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The second statement says somethin=\r\ng radical.

E.g.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. vitarka vicharanandasmita rupanugamat samprajnatah -\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n SASMITA SAMADHI\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.

In any case, what is called as Ahamkara in 24 principles of Sankhya is a=\r\nctually Asmita, which can be very-loosely pitted as Ahamkara.\n&gt; \n&gt; The idea=\r\n stated by me was on firm grounds - with reference to Patanjali Sutras and =\r\nthe words of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi. And this idea is the=\r\nre in my first mail, though not the exact table: \n&gt; \n&gt; PHYSICAL I-NESS (AHA=\r\nMKARA) =3D ASMITA =3D Physical Egotism\n&gt; ASTRAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA) =3D MANAS=\r\n =3D Astral attachments\n&gt; CAUSAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA) =3D CHITTA =3D Causal Pe=\r\nrceptions\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, one of the 2 reasons that I had given on why Astral/Ca=\r\nusal Body beings don&#39;t have sense of Asmita as a dominant sense of I-ness i=\r\ns this:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like ey=\r\nes to \n&gt; &gt; see, hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Yogi)... the sense of egoism does not take roots in the astral-body &gt; and =\r\nhence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karma.\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, Causal bodied beings can =\r\nuse thought to sense everything.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out=\r\n while the consciousness is \n&gt; &gt; associated with the Physical Body sensory =\r\nactivities or has \n&gt; &gt; Physical Karma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Lastly, extending upon this ide=\r\na further, there are beings in the Astral cosmos who have never been in Phy=\r\nsical forms - We Physical beings are not the only ones in the cycles of cre=\r\nation. While they will still have the idea of &quot;Asmita&quot; in their causal bodi=\r\nes, but they will always be repelled by the grosser-vibrations of Sensual e=\r\nxperiences in Physical Bodies/Cosmos, and hence would not incur any Physica=\r\nl Karma due to &quot;Asmita&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- -\n&gt; [ TO ALL IN THE LIST ] \n&gt; - If the above explanation =\r\nresolves the issue, well and good.

My comme=\r\nnts on that is:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. I-ness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chit=\r\nta has no innate power to Control any other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Reason:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Soul is the only Truth and controller, everything else ha=\r\ns an unreal and derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ideas co-ordinate with =\r\neach other, and not control each other. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. A new-born child o=\r\nr a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use his sense-consciousness coher=\r\nently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness derived from Manas, that coo=\r\nrdinates the senses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty to in=\r\nteract with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you have=\r\n proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of I-ne=\r\nss, not due to Buddhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Nara=\r\nsimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out o=\r\nf the 19 or 35 attributes of individualized consciousness, which one gives =\r\nthe idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness =\r\nor egosense or ego principle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I am this&quot;=\r\n limited to a physical body? Of course not! If someone says &quot;so and so pers=\r\non is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel offended or if someone says &quot;so and =\r\nso person is a great person&quot;, one may feel elated. One&#39;s ahamkara or I-ness=\r\n is identifying with the criticism or praise, even though nothing is being =\r\ndone to the physical body and only a name is being used. When somebody call=\r\ns one by name from distance (as opposed to patting on the physical body and=\r\n calling), one&#39;s consciousness may still think &quot;I am being called&quot; and one =\r\nmay turn towards the caller. As in these examples, one&#39;s I-ness does of cou=\r\nrse bind itself to more than a body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dr=\r\neam while sleeping. One may have forgotten totally about the physical body =\r\nin the dream! One may think of something else as &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may se=\r\ne oneself as a different body or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one m=\r\nay have the sense that so and so thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when =\r\nthe mind is drawn away from the physical body, there is still a notion of &quot;=\r\nI am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is a=\r\nbsolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical body=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deities like Agni do not have ahamk=\r\nara (I-ness) because they do not have physical bodies is incorrect. Of cour=\r\nse, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I am Agni and this is what I do&quot;. =\r\nIf he did not have that I-ness, he would not do everything he does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individualized consciousness do i=\r\nnteract with each other, whether we use the word &quot;control&quot; for some of thos=\r\ne interactions or not. For example, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mi=\r\nnd) judges various past experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mi=\r\nnd) and tells it what to do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas (organs=\r\n of action) and makes them do various things. My buddhi determined what to =\r\nwrite and my manas told my hands to type this and I ended up typing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is =\r\ntotally out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, t=\r\nhe logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different=\r\n parts of individualized consciousness and they play different roles while =\r\ninteracting with each other in different ways. Some of those interactions m=\r\nay be deemed to be controls.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the termin=\r\nologies, though my mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in details.

Where did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One does not &quot;read up&quot; these things in a single place.

There are several sources that speak of different aspects of this k=\r\nnowledge in slightly different terms.

Your understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1. Al=\r\nl ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the ideational o=\r\nr causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the physical body (See=\r\n point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a physical/astral=\r\n body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara like we do.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sens=\r\nory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense =\r\nof I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized=\r\n consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. Where did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a fine line between the sense of I-ness attributed =\r\nto the Individual Soul and the sense of I-ness derived through the idea of =\r\nAhamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuality=\r\n of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), while it ha=\r\ns already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Individuality of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea =\r\nof Ahamkara because &quot;What exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the =\r\nidea of Ahamkara, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t acc=\r\nount for neither controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independen=\r\nt of another, without requiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise you=\r\nr buddhi would always interfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or=\r\n the 5 functions of life-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially=\r\n, the 35 ideas of causal body are the basic causal forces and are not relat=\r\ned as cause-effect to each other. Thus, each is independent of the applicat=\r\nion of the sense of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being tw=\r\no of the Causal-ideas, their functioning as well as existence is not &quot;contr=\r\nolled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear w=\r\nhen we see those with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heavi=\r\nest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t work upon that particular idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the=\r\n entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3. =\r\nWell, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal c=\r\nosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-bo=\r\ndied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activi=\r\nties. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individualized conscious=\r\nness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as for an =\r\nastral/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An Astral-bodied being thinks of Mana=\r\ns/sense- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized consc=\r\niousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/perceptive- cons=\r\nciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; However, that individuality is of the Soul not derived from any idea=\r\n, which is why it is not lost when the Astral being loses astral consciousn=\r\ness and reincarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an examp=\r\nle, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are able to work through all the bein=\r\ngs in all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh resides in the =\r\nMooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never getting controlled b=\r\ny Ahamkara that would require them to say that this particular body is &quot;my =\r\nbody&quot; or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in Physical bodies themse=\r\nlves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodied beings, so they would att=\r\nempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bound worshipp=\r\ner. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; physical body =\r\nas well as act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of=\r\n the four antahkaranas, chitta (remembering or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; min=\r\nd) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are parts of the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sare=\r\nera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per t=\r\nhe resurrected Soul of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comp=\r\nrising Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowled=\r\nge, 5 functions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprisi=\r\nng Physical body (16 chemical elements).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as we al=\r\nl know that Physical body expires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16=\r\n elements comprising it go away at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are als=\r\no cast off as a whole in the corresponding cosmic consciousness - instead o=\r\nf different constituent ideas slipping out of it at different times. Chitta=\r\n being the staging idea for all other modifications, can be termed as the l=\r\nast to go, when the causal body is finally dropped - hence I wrote as risin=\r\ng above Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound wi=\r\nth Gross Physical vibrations, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manas with Subtle Astral vibration=\r\ns and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta with infinitely Subtle Causal Vibrations.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi being another variable, can be developed or undeveloped =\r\nirrespective of the other 34. Even illiterate Moodha, through surrender to =\r\ntheir Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkara and so on...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nBTW, Chitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store the residual imp=\r\nressions of all the past incarnations. However, being constituted of Satwa =\r\nGuna, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impres=\r\nsions, just like a container containing an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t autom=\r\natically burn it down. Sadhana is required for That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Samskara=\r\ns stored by Chitta, including those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, P=\r\nramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna =\r\n- hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my pre=\r\nvious mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by th=\r\ne Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once the Chitta calms down, clea=\r\nred of all residual impressions, only Satva Guna remains, the intuition bec=\r\nomes coherent and the Soul reflects on itself as distinct from Satva Guna o=\r\nf Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing its own nature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanakt=\r\nyore katmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer =\r\nwith the instrument of seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkar=\r\na.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes=\r\n to see, hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... th=\r\ne sense of egoism does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t =\r\ncreate Astral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sen=\r\nse everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out whi=\r\nle the consciousness is associated with the Physical Body sensory activitie=\r\ns or has Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as the =\r\ncontroller of sense-consciousness , must be overcome in Astral body, throug=\r\nh Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar i=\r\nllustrates that only those beings who cannot be tempted to go back to the p=\r\nleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted to stay permanently in the C=\r\nausal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-consciousness which is asso=\r\nciated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras also it is=\r\n mentioned in the same manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dristanushravika visha=\r\nya vitrishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That ef=\r\nfect which comes to these who have given up their thirst after objects, eit=\r\nher seen or heard, and which wills to control the objects, is non-attachmen=\r\nt.

At one stage, you said =\r\n&quot;Ahamkara isn&#39;t the dominant cause of I-ness in Astral/Causal bodies&quot;, whil=\r\ne I was saying ahamkara=3DI-ness. Now, you wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; PHYSICAL I-NE=\r\nSS (AHAMKARA) =3D ASMITA =3D Physical Egotism&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ASTRAL I-NESS (AHAMKA=\r\nRA) =3D MANAS =3D Astral attachments&lt;BR&gt;&gt; CAUSAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA) =3D C=\r\nHITTA =3D Causal Perceptions&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So you are acknowledging that I-ness an=\r\nd ahamkara are synonyms and referring to ahamkara at astral and causal plan=\r\nes. It is good that you are slowly converging!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I did no=\r\nt want to divert from the upanishadic terminology of 19 ideas of individual=\r\nized consciousness. So I stuck to the term ahamkaara and ignored your refer=\r\nences to Patanjali. Now that there is some convergence on &quot;ahamkaara&quot;, let =\r\nme address &quot;asmita&quot; mentioned in Patanjali yoga sutras.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; identif=\r\nication of the seer with the\n instrument of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; seeing i.e. Physical se=\r\nnses.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You are assuming that physical senses or physical body is the =\r\nonly instrument of seeing (or experiencing) .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, mind can see,=\r\n hear, feel and experience things even when it is not working with a physic=\r\nal body and physical senses. For example, one&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; something in=\r\n a dream without the physical eyes seeing anything.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also, a yogi in =\r\ndeep meditation may see, hear, feel or experience something without the inv=\r\nolvement of eyes, ears and other physical senses.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If such a yogi ide=\r\nntifies with the instrument of that experience, i.e. the mind, that too is =\r\nasmita as per Patanjali&#39;s yoga sutra that you quoted. Just as I had an issu=\r\ne earlier with your limiting of ahamkaara to physical body, I also have an =\r\nissue with your limiting of asmita to physical body.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;BTW, identifica=\r\ntion with physical body *as well as* identification with mind block one fro=\r\nm yoga (communion)\n with true Self. Both are due to ahamkaara as defined by=\r\n upanishads.

Here is the reason.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nIn my first mail (#2704) itself it is explicitly written, that Patanjali ha=\r\ns used the exact word &quot;asmita&quot; for Egoism - which is the I-ness (Ahamkara) =\r\nin Physical body consciousness - that causes identification of the seer wit=\r\nh the instrument of seeing i.e. Physical senses.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In P=\r\natanjali Yoga Sutras:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore katmataivasmita -6&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instrument of=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; seeing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Patanjali has used Asm=\r\nita instead of Ahamkara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; PATANJALI has not used t=\r\nhe word AHAMKARA anywhere in his PRECISE AND ESTEEMED sanskrit dissertation=\r\n on YOGA - he has chosen to use the word ASMITA everywhere. E.g.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; 1. vitarka vicharanandasmita\n rupanugamat samprajnatah -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; SASMITA SAMADHI&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2. From Lahiri Mahasayas&#39; Commentary=\r\n on Patanjali - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; avidyasmitaragadves habhinibeshah panchak=\r\nleshah&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Avidya&quot; [ignorance], &quot;asmita&quot; [egotism], &quot;raga&quot; [a=\r\nttraction or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; liking], &quot;dvesha&quot; [hatred or disliking] and &quot;abhinibe=\r\nsha&quot; [engrossment] -- these are the five types of afflictions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; Thus, using &quot;Ahamkara&quot; while talking about Sankhya and using &quot;Asmita&quot; =\r\nwhile talking about Patanjali Sutras brought in the conflict. In any case, =\r\nwhat is called as Ahamkara in 24 principles of Sankhya is actually Asmita, =\r\nwhich can be very-loosely pitted as Ahamkara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The idea sta=\r\nted by me was on firm grounds - with reference to Patanjali Sutras and the =\r\nwords of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi. And this idea is there i=\r\nn my first mail, though not the exact table: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; PHYSICAL I-N=\r\nESS (AHAMKARA) =3D ASMITA =3D\n Physical Egotism&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ASTRAL I-NESS (AHAM=\r\nKARA) =3D MANAS =3D Astral attachments&lt;BR&gt;&gt; CAUSAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA) =3D=\r\n CHITTA =3D Causal Perceptions&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Also, one of the 2 reasons =\r\nthat I had given on why Astral/Causal Body beings don&#39;t have sense of Asmit=\r\na as a dominant sense of I-ness is this:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Since astral=\r\n-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; see, he=\r\nar, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yogi)...=\r\n the sense of egoism does not take roots in the astral-body &gt; and hence =\r\ndoesn&#39;t create Astral Karma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Similarly, Causal bodied beings c=\r\nan use thought to sense everything.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism ha=\r\ns to be rooted out while the consciousness is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; associated with=\r\n the Physical Body sensory activities or has &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Physical Karma.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Lastly, extending upon this idea further, there are beings=\r\n in the Astral cosmos who have\n never been in Physical forms - We Physical =\r\nbeings are not the only ones in the cycles of creation. While they will sti=\r\nll have the idea of &quot;Asmita&quot; in their causal bodies, but they will always b=\r\ne repelled by the grosser-vibrations of Sensual experiences in Physical Bod=\r\nies/Cosmos, and hence would not incur any Physical Karma due to &quot;Asmita&quot;.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; [ TO ALL IN THE LIST ] &lt;BR&gt;&gt; - If the above explanation re=\r\nsolves the issue, well and good.

Meaning &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Aha=\r\nmkara isn&#39;t the dominant cause of I-ness in Astral/Causal bodies&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; And as a result wouldn&#39;t contribute to the acquisition of=\r\n Astral/Causal Karma.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Why is Ahamkara not domina=\r\nnt in Astral/Causal bodies ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The reason I have already given i=\r\nn the first mail in sufficient detail.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; IF THE AH=\r\nAMKARA IS NOT SUPPRESSED AFTER PHYSICAL DEATH, THE PERSON WILL KEEP CARRYIN=\r\nG THE SAME EARTHLY IDENTITY TO THE ASTRAL PLANES, AND BRING IT BACK AT REBI=\r\nRTH TO THE EARTH.

My comments on that is:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. I-ness derived from Ahamkara,Manas and Chitta=\r\n has no innate power to Control any other idea of the 35 Causal-ideas.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; Reason:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Soul is the only Truth and controll=\r\ner,\n everything else has an unreal and derived existence. Thus, all the 35 =\r\nideas co-ordinate with each other, and not control each other. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. A new-born child or a person in Hypnotic-Tranc=\r\ne, is able to use his sense-consciousness coherently due to the astral-body=\r\ns&#39; sense of I-ness derived from Manas, that coordinates the senses.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; He has no Buddhi or discriminating faculty to interact with mana=\r\ns (sensory-motor mind) and tell it what to do - as you have proposed. Thus,=\r\n Manas co-ordinates the senses due to its own sense of I-ness, not due to B=\r\nuddhi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifies.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha P=\r\nVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Na=\r\nmaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the 19 or\n 35 =\r\nattributes of individualized consciousness, which one gives the idea &quot;I am =\r\nthis&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness or egosense or =\r\nego principle!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is one&#39;s idea=\r\n of &quot;I am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of course not! If someone says =\r\n&quot;so and so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel offended or if someon=\r\ne says &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one may feel elated. One&#39;s aha=\r\nmkara or I-ness is identifying with the criticism or praise, even though no=\r\nthing is being done to the physical body and only a name is being used. Whe=\r\nn somebody calls one by name from distance (as opposed to patting on the ph=\r\nysical body and calling), one&#39;s consciousness may still think &quot;I am being c=\r\nalled&quot; and one may turn towards the caller. As in these examples, one&#39;s I-n=\r\ness does of course bind itself to more than a body.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose one gets a dream while sleeping.\n One may h=\r\nave forgotten totally about the physical body in the dream! One may think o=\r\nf something else as &quot;I&quot;. In dreams, one may see oneself as a different body=\r\n or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself, but still one may have the sense that so and=\r\n so thing is happening to &quot;me&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away from t=\r\nhe physical body, there is still a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a drea=\r\nm. That is ahamkara or I-ness or ego principle.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limited to physical body is =\r\nabsolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends beyond the physical bod=\r\ny.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, your idea that deit=\r\nies like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have physic=\r\nal bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I a=\r\nm Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he would not=\r\n do everything he does.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Mor=\r\neover, the 19 or 35 ideas of individualized consciousness do interact with =\r\neach other, whether we use the word &quot;control&quot; for some of those interaction=\r\ns or not. For example, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges va=\r\nrious past experiences, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells=\r\n it what to do. Then manas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) a=\r\nnd makes them do various things. My buddhi determined what to write and my =\r\nmanas told my hands to type this and I ended up typing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your point about &quot;what exists as a part cannot =\r\nbe the whole&quot; is totally out of place. The sense of I-ness, the memories an=\r\nd conditioning, the logical mind, the sensory-motor mind, karmendriyas etc =\r\nare all different parts of individualized consciousness and they play diffe=\r\nrent roles while interacting with each other in different ways. Some of tho=\r\nse interactions may be deemed to be\n controls.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologies, though my mail =\r\ndidn&#39;t&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in details.
