It IS possible.\n\nBelieve me, all it takes for Her is a split second to turn a fool into a \nself-realized person.\n\nYou will do yourself a big favor if you take the thoughts of &quot;extraordinary \nexperiences&quot; off your mind. These expectations are a big obstacle.\n\nIf you normally feel sad or angry or upset when someone criticizes you badly \nand you are now able to feel normal in that situation, isn&#39;t that a \n&quot;tangible&quot; sign of progress? If you normally feel elated when someone \npraises you to the sky and you are now able to feel normal in that \nsituation, isn&#39;t that a &quot;tangible&quot; sign of progress?\n\nInstead of focusing your senses outward and looking for some miracle or an \n&quot;extraordinaty experience&quot;, focus your senses inward, watch your thoughts \nand instincts closely and refine them. Try to reach a state where criticism \nand praise are the same for you.\n\nThat will put you in a good stead. THAT is real progress. If you make real \nprogress and do not bother about any &quot;extraordinary experiences&quot;, you may \nindeed have an extraordinary experience oneday! Not the one that gets you \nstuck with a sense of possessiveness or entitlement, but the one that frees \nyou.\n\n&gt; If i think rationally and take the experiences of others than it is\n&gt; quite clear that the spiritual growth invariably comes along with\n&gt; some out of the world and tangiable experiences. this some times\n&gt; temporarily disappoints me.\n\nOne can get stuck in some expectations that are unknowingly formed in the \nmind based on what one read or heard.\n\nOne can get stuck in possessiveness or a sense of entitlement over an \n&quot;extraordinary experience&quot; that actually happened to him.\n\nOne can get stuck in many ways.\n\nIf you do not want to get stuck, have no expectations. Have no sense of \nownership over anything. Surrender to Her fully, not because it will give X \nor Y or Z, but because everything is really Hers. Keep looking at yourself \nand your own actions/thoughts and refine them to make the sense of surrender \nfuller and fuller. And expect to get nothing from Her in return for that \nsurrender. That is a surefire way to succeed in one&#39;s spiritual pursuit.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, November 10, 2008 11:59 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today\n\n\nNamaste Garu,\n\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are attracted to Thakur and his teachings, benefit from\n&gt;them.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Utpal,\n&gt;\n&gt; My best wishes to all on the occasion of Ksheeraabdhi Dwaadashi!\n&gt;\n&gt; One of the two saints could be Thakur. It is also possible that\nneither is\n&gt; Thakur.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bottomline is that it does not really matter!\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are attracted to Thakur and his teachings, benefit from\nthem. Beings\n&gt; like Thakur are born out of free volition and out of compassion for\nother\n&gt; beings. They are the playmates of the Mother and are reborn as a\npart of Her\n&gt; plan. They are born to show the path to others. However, there are\nmany\n&gt; paths. In each life, they may take up a different mission and\ndemonstrate\n&gt; different paths to people through their teachings and deeds. If you\nlike the\n&gt; teachings of such a being in a specific birth, due to some rina\nwith the\n&gt; path taught in that birth, follow the teachings of that birth. Who\nelse the\n&gt; same being was in other births is not that relevant or useful.\n&gt;\n&gt; If you are attracted to the teachings of any saint - Ramakrishna\nParamahamsa\n&gt; or Shriram Sharma Acharya or Yogeshwar ji or Ramana Maharshi or\nAurobindo or\n&gt; Srila Prabhupada or Akkalkot Maharaj or Sai Baba or Kabir or\nSamartha\n&gt; Ramadas or Jnaneshwar Maharaj or Chaitanya Mahaprabhu or\nRamanujacharya or\n&gt; Raghavedra Swami or Gautama Buddha or Jesus Christ or whoever,\nfollow the\n&gt; teachings of that saint and benefit from them. Other speculative\nthings\n&gt; about them may be interesting, but can turn out to be a mere\ndistraction.\n&gt;\n&gt; Find the teachings and path that attracts you the most. Read the\nteachings.\n&gt; More importantly, try to *walk* the path. Imbibe the teachings in\nyour\n&gt; thinking and in your common sense. Your actions and thoughts should\nreflect\n&gt; the teachings. Focus on the teachings of the saint, digest them\nfully and\n&gt; base your thoughts and actions on them.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; Regarding Ramakrishna, I want to say one thing. The extent to which\nhe\n&gt; imbibed the upanishadic philosophy in his thoughts and actions, the\ndepth of\n&gt; his sense of surrender to the Mother and the absolute lack of\npersonal ego\n&gt; in him are the real miracles to me. Other miracles are useful to\ninstill\n&gt; faith and confidence in some people. But they do not do justice to\nhis\n&gt; personality. In fact, Swami Vivekananda was very conscious of\npossibly\n&gt; limiting Thakur&#39;s personality to a bunch of miracles and was\nconcerned if\n&gt; books on him would be able to do justice to his personality.\n&gt;\n&gt; If Ramakrishna Paramahamsa tranformed a bunch of youngsters into\nspiritual\n&gt; giants who affected the spirituality of generations and if Srila\nPrabhupada\n&gt; transformed many fallen souls into excellent saints who changed the\nworld,\n&gt; it was possible because of their *total* surrender to the Lord and\nthe\n&gt; zeroness of their personal ego. *That* is a true miracle.\n&gt;\n&gt; I do not want to downplay the discussion of other tangible\nmiracles. But I\n&gt; do not want people to lose track of the crux of the matter.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ramakrishna could do miracles because he had no ego and surrendered\nfully to\n&gt; Her. *She* did everything for him.\n&gt;\n&gt; As I said earlier, a person with normal ego can do some things; a\nperson\n&gt; with very little personal ego can do tremendous things; and, a\nperson with\n&gt; *no* personal ego can do *any* thing. Our goal should be to\neradicate\n&gt; personal ego through constant vigilance and total surrender.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Sunday, November 09, 2008 3:07 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is still alive today\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; one Gayatri Upaasaka told me many years back that Shri Ram Sharma\n&gt; Acharya was born as Thakur Ramkrishna in previous life.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another as intresting as well as equally confusing thing is that\n&gt; Late Shri Yogeshwarji (A Gujarati yogi) had also revealtion about\n&gt; his past life and he also indirectly indicated in his biography that\n&gt; he was Thakur Ramkrishna in the previous birth.\n&gt;\n&gt; Yours,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt;\n&gt; I know\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Shiv&quot; &lt;theblisswithin@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Respected Ashwinji\n&gt; &gt; This is a very good and inspiring thread.\n&gt; &gt; I would like to mention something that may be an interesting\n&gt; insight.\n&gt; &gt; You mentioned Pt Shriram Sharma Acharya.

His Guru then made him realise his past lives\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; gave him the work for this life.\n&gt; &gt; He took him back as in a flash to the past. He realised that he\nhad\n&gt; &gt; been born as Thakur, before that Saint Kabir and before that Guru\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; Chatrapati Shivaji, Guru Ramdass.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I will try to locate the exact link and send it.The general site\nis\n&gt; &gt; www.awgp.org I remember the book is there on pdf in English\n&gt; somewhere\n&gt; &gt; online.

This is an unbelievable experience that\nI\n&gt; &gt; have had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing\n&gt; exactly\n&gt; &gt; as was happened in my life. I am going back to the period of\n&gt; 1973/74.\n&gt; &gt; Kindly read this only when you are in religious mood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office near\n&gt; Dwarka.\n&gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post\n&gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep�?Tt; I had friendship with some\n&gt; Telephone\n&gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr.\nPatel)\n&gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of� � � shri\n&gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking\n&gt; about\n&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekly\n&gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; him and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly\n&gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30\n&gt; &gt; then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty\nhours\n&gt; &gt; and were talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--\n&gt; �?oRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; some guest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My\n&gt; son\n&gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now�?\n�. -\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be a plane\n&gt; crash\n&gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about\n&gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus,\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet\nI\n&gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwarka as was\n&gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; on the way. This was surprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super\n&gt; power\n&gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to\n&gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri\n&gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered\n&gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel�?Ts house before Thakur picture. I prayed\n&gt; him\n&gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his\n&gt; grace.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning\n&gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was\n&gt; waking\n&gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have\n&gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and\n&gt; she\n&gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. �?&quot;�?oWhy should you take such a hasty\n&gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He\n&gt; was a\n&gt; &gt; great Saint but our Guru should be living one, who can guide us,\n&gt; give\n&gt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma\n&gt; Acharya\n&gt; &gt; since you are doing Gayatri Mantra�?�--.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were right at her place as people in general not\n&gt; know\n&gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken\n&gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was\ntelling\n&gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before accepting him. I also decided\nto\n&gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that �?&quot;�?oSee, Mr. Patel\n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen him. He has never\n&gt; asked\n&gt; &gt; me where I am living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house\n&gt; within\n&gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, would you believe that my selection for Thakur\nis\n&gt; &gt; perfect?�?�--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me�?&quot;�?oHow it is possible? I don�?Tt believe.�?\n�-\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my\n&gt; &gt; decision and convince my wife. �?~I want to test your existence\n&gt; even\n&gt; &gt; today.�?T\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the\n&gt; &gt; morning with angry mood. What he told?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �?~ How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what\nhappened?\n&gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my home at\n05.30\n&gt; &gt; mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly\nThakur\n&gt; &gt; pulled my blanket and told me that-�?o Go to your friend�?Ts\n&gt; house. He\n&gt; &gt; is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his\n&gt; house�?�\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding me the way\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; your house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are\n&gt; disturbing\n&gt; &gt; him in such an early morning for such a silly things?�?T\n&gt; &gt; &gt; We both were so excited and surprised that we had no words that\n&gt; &gt; Morning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life.\n&gt; There\n&gt; &gt; were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will\n&gt; write\n&gt; &gt; it sometime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on the\n&gt; &gt; earth. This is a fact I have written and no word is added to\n&gt; &gt; exaggerate.� May Shri Thakur bless all of us.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad\n\n\n"}}
