Yo=\r\nu can break each \n          coconut Half with your both the Palms and make =\r\n3 to 4 pieces.\n\n          2) A very small bowl of Ghee (roughly 6 to 8 full=\r\n teaspoons) is \n          sufficient as &#39;Ghee Aahutis&#39; are to be given as o=\r\nnly a single drop \n          whenever it is mentioned in the Manual.\n\n     =\r\n     3) When Ghee Aahutis are specifically not mentioned, one can offer \n  =\r\n        Aaahutis of Mamara (Kurmura), Almond, Cahshewnuts, Kishmis, Daadiya=\r\n \n          etc... Now one can choose each of the above stuffs one by one f=\r\nor \n          offering as aahuti or can use single stuff.\n\n          to ela=\r\nborate, at each Swaha, one can take One Kishmis or Few Mamara \n          or=\r\n one almond or one cahsenut, or few Daadiya and offer to Agni.\n\n          I=\r\nf you have Havan Saamagri (I suppose it is mixuture of some stuff \n        =\r\n  which can be offer in to Homa fire), then it can also be offered as \n    =\r\n      Aahuti same as like other mentioned above. i.e. after swaha, take \n  =\r\n        very little &#39;Havan samgri powder and offer it.\n\n          Thus one =\r\nperson can easily perform homam as explained above because \n          first=\r\nly, one doesn&#39;t need to give Aahutis of Ghee and other stuff \n          sim=\r\nultaneously. secondly, Counting of any mantra can be done with \n          l=\r\neft fingers while offering aahutis by right hand.\n\n          2 kg of Havan =\r\nSaamagri is more than enough. in fact even 100 gms \n          will be suffi=\r\ncient if you use along with along with Kurmura etc..\n\n          4) The Homa=\r\n Fire represents Bhootagni of the person doing Homam. \n          hence it i=\r\ns suggested that Aahutis are only offered by You alone \n          while mot=\r\nher and others can sit beside you and concentrate. they \n          will gai=\r\nn lot of spiritual benefit just by attending.\n\n          5) Wooden Ladle is=\r\n ideal but in the absence of that copper one can \n          also be used.\n\n=\r\n          6) I have not much idea about the way of priest who offer ghee \n =\r\n         aahuti in Homa Agni as well as in water bowl. i think i&#39;ve also se=\r\nen \n          that during Chandi Homam of Ashtami during Navaraatri. I supp=\r\nose it \n          also must be one of the right ways. however i have comple=\r\nte faith in \n          what Narasimha has given in Manual and that also mus=\r\nt be the other \n          right way of many ways. although you can choose b=\r\netween the above \n          two, i recommend to go as per the Manual if you=\r\n are going to do as \n          per the manual given by him.\n\n          Last=\r\nly, i would suggest not to bother yourself with much \n          technicalit=\r\nies and burden of perfection. in the first few runs, \n          there are m=\r\nany things during Havan which can go imperefct. do as per \n          manual=\r\n and enjoy you Homam with your mother & others and offcourse \n          wit=\r\nh the mother of universe !!!\n\n          I hope, i gave you the answers - Be=\r\nautifully.\n\n          Warm Regards,\n\n          Utpal\n\n          --- In vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot; \n          &lt;khosladheeraj@ ...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n          &gt;\n          &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;DH=\r\nEERAJ KHOSLA&quot; \n          &gt; &lt;khosladheeraj@ &gt; wrote:\n          &gt; &gt;\n         =\r\n &gt; &gt; Namaskar Narsimhaji and others,\n          &gt; &gt; \n          &gt; &gt; I want to=\r\n do homam for chandi \n          devi.I \n          &gt; &gt; had arranged a copper=\r\n tray in square shape.Almost 1 feet by 1 \n          &gt; feet. \n          &gt; &gt; =\r\nSo is it good measurement or not ?

You can break each &lt;BR&gt;coconut Half with your \n          both the Pa=\r\nlms and make 3 to 4 pieces.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) A very small bowl of \n          Ghee =\r\n(roughly 6 to 8 full teaspoons) is &lt;BR&gt;sufficient as &#39;Ghee \n          Aahut=\r\nis&#39; are to be given as only a single drop &lt;BR&gt;whenever it is \n          men=\r\ntioned in the Manual.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3) When Ghee Aahutis are specifically \n       =\r\n   not mentioned, one can offer &lt;BR&gt;Aaahutis of Mamara (Kurmura), Almond, \n=\r\n          Cahshewnuts, Kishmis, Daadiya &lt;BR&gt;etc... Now one can choose each =\r\nof \n          the above stuffs one by one for &lt;BR&gt;offering as aahuti or can=\r\n use \n          single stuff.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;to elaborate, at each Swaha, one can t=\r\nake One \n          Kishmis or Few Mamara &lt;BR&gt;or one almond or one cahsenut,=\r\n or few \n          Daadiya and offer to Agni.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you have Havan Saam=\r\nagri (I \n          suppose it is mixuture of some stuff &lt;BR&gt;which can be of=\r\nfer in to Homa \n          fire), then it can also be offered as &lt;BR&gt;Aahuti =\r\nsame as like other \n          mentioned above. i.e. after swaha, take &lt;BR&gt;v=\r\nery little &#39;Havan samgri \n          powder and offer it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus one pe=\r\nrson can easily perform homam \n          as explained above because &lt;BR&gt;fir=\r\nstly, one doesn&#39;t need to give \n          Aahutis of Ghee and other stuff &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;simultaneously. secondly, Counting \n          of any mantra can be done =\r\nwith &lt;BR&gt;left fingers while offering aahutis \n          by right hand.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;2 kg of Havan Saamagri is more than enough. in \n          fact even 100 =\r\ngms &lt;BR&gt;will be sufficient if you use along with along \n          with Kurm=\r\nura etc..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4) The Homa Fire represents Bhootagni of the \n          pe=\r\nrson doing Homam. &lt;BR&gt;hence it is suggested that Aahutis are only \n        =\r\n  offered by You alone &lt;BR&gt;while mother and others can sit beside you \n    =\r\n      and concentrate. they &lt;BR&gt;will gain lot of spiritual benefit just by =\r\n\n          attending.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5) Wooden Ladle is ideal but in the absence of=\r\n that \n          copper one can &lt;BR&gt;also be used.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;6) I have not much=\r\n idea about \n          the way of priest who offer ghee &lt;BR&gt;aahuti in Homa =\r\nAgni as well as in \n          water bowl. i think i&#39;ve also seen &lt;BR&gt;that d=\r\nuring Chandi Homam of \n          Ashtami during Navaraatri. I suppose it &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;also must be one of the \n          right ways. however i have complete fa=\r\nith in &lt;BR&gt;what Narasimha has \n          given in Manual and that also must=\r\n be the other &lt;BR&gt;right way of many \n          ways. although you can choos=\r\ne between the above &lt;BR&gt;two, i recommend \n          to go as per the Manual=\r\n if you are going to do as &lt;BR&gt;per the manual \n          given by him.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;Lastly, i would suggest not to bother yourself \n          with much &lt;BR&gt;=\r\ntechnicalities and burden of perfection. in the first \n          few runs, =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;there are many things during Havan which can go \n          imperefct. d=\r\no as per &lt;BR&gt;manual and enjoy you Homam with your mother \n          &amp; o=\r\nthers and offcourse &lt;BR&gt;with the mother of universe \n          !!!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I=\r\n hope, i gave you the answers - Beautifully.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Warm \n          Regards=\r\n,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yaho=\r\nogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot; \n          &lt;BR&gt;&lt;khosladheeraj@ ...&gt=\r\n; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A \n          href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%4=\r\n0yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank \n          rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ y=\r\nahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot; \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;khosladheeraj=\r\n@ &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          Namaskar Narsimhaji and =\r\nothers,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I want to \n          do homam for chandi=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;devi.I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; had arranged a copper \n          tray in square s=\r\nhape.Almost 1 feet by 1 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; feet. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          So is it go=\r\nod measurement or not ?

I have arranged 2 kg of havan \n      =\r\n    samagri, 1 kg dry &lt;BR&gt;&gt; coconuts &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; etc..So how to \n     =\r\n     divide this in ratio as per single day &lt;BR&gt;process.How &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n          much ghee in grams per havana.ALthough i am reading your pdf &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nnotes \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on homam again and again but doing practical=\r\n things r \n          difficult &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; need much more fo=\r\ncus and \n          methodology.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Although by God =\r\ngrace and your \n          encouragement to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; people for doing h=\r\nomams, even i myself \n          get transformed towards &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; homam=\r\n ,so thanks for that. But i \n          need your step by step guidance &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; as &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; everything \n          is not included in your notes( =\r\nalthough its best &lt;BR&gt;notes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &gt; on homam). Its my weak=\r\nness actually.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In norma=\r\nl homams by priests in India ,they do &lt;BR&gt;swaha \n          &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wi=\r\nth ghee in fire aswell in water.So tell me, I mean \n          after they &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; pour &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ghee through spoon in agni \n          ,they immed=\r\niately pour one drop of &lt;BR&gt;ghee &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in water \n          too. So =\r\nis it correct way or not ?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n          &=\r\ngt; If single person is doing a homam then how to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; manage \n        =\r\n  &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ahutis of ghee and samagri both and of course mantra \n     =\r\n     mala or &lt;BR&gt;notes &lt;BR&gt;&gt; u &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; provided ?
