While reciti=\r\nng the mantra, with a spoon take water into the palm from the water pot. Wh=\r\nen collecting the water into the palm, do not keep the hand flat (parallel =\r\nto the ground) as water might drop off.  Make the hand bowl-shaped. At the =\r\ntime of releasing the water, use one of the 3 appropriate ways to release t=\r\nhe water. \n&gt;      During the conclusion when you need to throw away the wat=\r\ner from the water pot, use the empty container. You can also some fresh wat=\r\ner from the second container to thoroughly clean the water pot. Now take th=\r\ne fresh water from the second container into the water pot and wrap up with=\r\n the last few mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Ravi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; __________________=\r\n______________\n&gt; From: m540i98 &lt;m540i98@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, April 15, 2009 7:21:21 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n A requst for another video\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; May I r=\r\nequest you to do a video of tarparna also. specially how one\n&gt; drops or off=\r\ners water.
