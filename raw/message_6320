The very longing for sannyasa shows that there is=\r\n growth of spirituality. Deluded people bring various vain arguments: =E2=\r\n=80=9CMohammed was a householder, Nanak was a householder, Rama married, Kr=\r\nishna married, and Ramakrishna Paramahansa married!=E2=80=9D Delusion!

The Bhagavata says that actual fire is not so dange=\r\nrous, burning charcoal is not so dangerous, as the company of worldly perso=\r\nns, worldly things! Worldly people always talk against sannyasa, against re=\r\nnunciation and tapas! Even a cobra is not so very dangerous as these delude=\r\nd people! \n\n\n"}}
