Krishna&#39;s=\r\n beeja akshara is Kleem while Kali&#39;s beeja akshara is Kreem. Whereas, Rama =\r\nis equated to Taaraa, the Raama Naama is called the Taaraka mantra. Taaraa =\r\nmeans crossing and she is the one who helps us cross-over from the material=\r\n plane to the spiritual plane. Raama also had to cross the ocean to get Sit=\r\na. Esoterically, Raama is the soul, Lakshmana is the single-pointed concent=\r\nration (lakshya-mana) and Sita is the Kundalini Shakti. Raavana who stands =\r\nfor our material desires steals Sita and takes her away to Lanka, stands fo=\r\nr how our material desires makes the kundalini remain in the mooladhara. Th=\r\ne beeja akshara of Mooladhaara is Lam, which is what Lanka is.\n\nMunda Maala=\r\n tantra has other parallels (equating Das Mahaavidya & Das Avataara) too, s=\r\nome of which makes sense and some of them dont.\n\nHope this helps.\n\nThanks\nN=\r\narayan\n\n\n\n"}}
