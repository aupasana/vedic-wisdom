I suggest sticking to gold, silver, copper, bronze, brass, clay etc. \nBut if one has access only to an aluminum or iron havan kunda (or tray), one \nmay do in it.\n\nWrapping the copper havan kund with aluminum foil so that the havan kund \nremains &quot;clean&quot; is also not a great idea. A bit of aluminum mixes with the \nfire slowly and that is not a great idea. Fire should come in contact with \nauspicious materials only.\n\nQuick burning logs containing artificial materials are also not a good idea. \nPlain firewood is better. Many people are doing homam with mainly dry \ncoconut.\n\nBrahma is invoked in a small silver bowl with water with darbhas placed on \nit and a small pooja is done to him and the bowl is placed on the south. \nVaruna is also invoked in another bowl. The procedure I give in the manuals \ngets rid of some steps to simplify. Things like Brahma pooja, Varuna pooja, \nAajya suddhi, punyaaha vaachana etc are all skipped. There are many steps \ngiven in tradition and different priests pick different sets of those steps. \nThere are different procedures in vogue, having some common features and \nsome differences. Doing all the steps makes it long. Not every step is \nequally important. If the main homam is 3 hours, having an overhead of 45 \nmin may be ok. But, if the main homam is 20 min, overhead has to be 5 min. \nAnd, a 20-30 min homam done everyday or every week is far more effective \nthan a 3-4 hour homam done rarely.\n\nTarpana is not necessary for all deities. You can skip it for Mahaganapathi \nhomam also. When you do tarpana, you can do it with milk or just water (in \nwhich a few akshatas were added).\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;m540i98&quot; &lt;m540i98@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, November 21, 2008 8:24 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Aluminium trays and some need some clarifications \nfor related stuff for homans\n\n\nNamaste\n\nIn the US a lot of priest do use aluminium trays for conducting homams\nIn fact when I started doing homans I also used aluminium trays till\nI got a copper kunda. We had in the past done a couple of homans in\nthe home and both times the priest(different) used aluminium trays\nand inthat they poured first sand and then on top of sand they used\ndry coconut and in the US we also get something called quick burning\nfire logs I suppose they contain some wood and the same material they\nuse to make candles, Oops I forgot the name of this material and some\nother things.\n\nSo I also when I started did use initially aluminium trays and also\nquick burning log along with coconut.\n\nFurther more I have actually wrapped the copper kunda with aluminium\nfoil so that the kunda remains clean. May be I should remove the\naluminium foil.\n\nAny conclusive guidance about wrapping haven kunda with aluminium foil\nand usage of quick burning log in the homa is appreciated.\n\nFurther I think there are few other things that are also needed, I am\nnote sure or understand their usage\n\nSuchi, srava, proksani and pranita and sphya. I have no understanding\nof these items as to how to use them. again any more information very\nmuch appreciated\n\nFurther I read somewhere that one needs to also invoke brahma for the\nentire time from start till poornahuti is done and is to be seated on\nthe south side, I am not sure how to do it.\n\nTarpana in the Ganapati homan, there is tarpana details but others\nlike laxmi or krishna or saani homan manuals do not seem to have or I\nmissed it. Do we need to do tarpana always with milk for all homans.\nI suppose so. Again some clarification would go long way\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, aparajita Vidya\n&lt;aparajita_vidya@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; �\n&gt; So aluminium aslo should not be considered a good thing as it means\nrahu...\n&gt; �\n&gt; -Best Wishes\n&gt; � Aparajita\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Fri, 21/11/08, Sanjay Prabhakaran &lt;sanjaychettiar@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Sanjay Prabhakaran &lt;sanjaychettiar@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Iron Homkunda\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, 21 November, 2008, 5:21 AM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; || Om Gurave Namah ||\n&gt; Dear Aparajita,\n&gt; � I dont know the sanskrit name for Aluminium.
