It is nice and I am sure s=\r\nelf-inquiry is a very valid path.\n\nHowever I have a small but crucial disag=\r\nreement.\n\n&lt;&lt;No, God will never appear before us. As we have seen in self-re=\r\nalisation, we have to realise the Brahmam by destroying maya.=C2=A0&gt;&gt;\n\n\nThi=\r\ns is not mandatory at all. Infact God can very well appear before a seeker =\r\nin a multitude of forms and sometimes in a form that is seemingly infinite.=\r\n Again God can come to a seeker not as a form but as a Light. Etc. Many pos=\r\nsibilities. That is why it is called God. He/She/it is beyond ALL limits, y=\r\net it rejects no option, that humans may impose on it through their minds o=\r\nr their experiences, spiritual or otherwise.\n\nThis thing called God is best=\r\n described by one adjective - Infinite. And the basic character of Infinity=\r\n is that it can&#39;t be totally understood by anyone. You can only understand =\r\nsome parts of it, every the entirety. Being Infinite, it is beyond restrict=\r\nions. So it is both with form and without form. And at times even simultane=\r\nously. [Sounds illogical no? But Infinity was anyway, even in mathematics, =\r\nnever within the purview of normal logic.]\n\nIt is only the limitations of t=\r\nhe seeker which limits the experience of God in all its totality. He/She/It=\r\n is the sum total of all that is imaginable, all that is difficult to imagi=\r\nne and all that just cannot be humanly imagined. Forms, therefore, get incl=\r\nuded inside it.\n\nOf forms again there are various characteristics. Not all =\r\nforms are similar. The same devata can appear in two different nature of fo=\r\nrm depending on the seeker, one maybe more sutble than the other.\n\nBasicall=\r\ny noting every single possibility makes it tremendously complicated, but bo=\r\nttomline is that God is both with form and also without form. And one is no=\r\nt necessarily higher than the other aspect of God.\n\nThat&#39;s my view. Feel fr=\r\nee to disagree. No imposition.\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n\nI have a hu=\r\nndred lives before me yet/ To grasp thee in, O spirit ethereal, / Be sure I=\r\n will with heart insatiate/ Pursue thee like a hunter through them all.-Sri=\r\n Aurobindo\n\n\n\nOn Tuesday, 7 January 2014 2:37 PM, &quot;aks_day@...&quot; &lt;aks_=\r\nday@...&gt; wrote:\n \n=C2=A0 \nHi All, \n\nOne really short simple summary o=\r\nf the path\nhttp://www.manblunder.com/2009/01/path.html\nhttp://www.manblunde=\r\nr.com/2009/01/final-destination.html\n\n\nTHE PATH\nWe\nhave seen a few steps to=\r\nwards self-realisation. Now let us discuss its\nimplementation. \n=C2=A0\nMedi=\r\ntation\nis the entry door for self-realisation. Normally, when we sit for me=\r\nditation,\nwe make so many preparations, like breathing exercises, bending a=\r\nnd stretching\nexercises, etc. We begin our meditation, as if God is going t=\r\no appear before\nus. No, God will never appear before us. As we have seen in=\r\n self-realisation,\nwe have to realise the Brahmam by destroying maya. The f=\r\nirst step in\nmeditation is to question ourselves. This is Ramana Maharishi=\r\n=E2=80=99s teaching.\nWe have to enquire =E2=80=9Cwho I am=E2=80=9D. Think a=\r\nbout our origin, how we had come to this\nearth, who would have created us a=\r\nnd why we have come to this earth. It is\ndifficult to find answers to these=\r\n questions in the beginning. But when we\nprobe deep into our self, we will =\r\nget answers one by one. Only after getting\nanswers for these questions, we =\r\ncan think of realizing the Brahmam. During\nthis, we need not necessarily lo=\r\nok into the basic aspects of meditation. When\nwe are set to seriously think=\r\n about the cause of our existence in this earth,\nit is only the beginning o=\r\nf the process of realisation. During these initial\nstages, we are neither g=\r\noing to drive away our thoughts, nor manifest anything.\nBagwan Ramakrishna =\r\nParamahamsa showed the form of Mother Kali to Vivekananda.\nVivekananda did =\r\nhave the vision of the Mother Kali. When we are talking of\nBrahman as the f=\r\normless, how can Bagwan Ramakrishna show the divine Mother in\nflesh and blo=\r\nod? That is because of the power of manifestation of Ramakrishna\nParamahams=\r\na. That kind of manifestation is extremely difficult for people like\nus, as=\r\n we have our own karmas to perform. The utmost concentration is necessary\nf=\r\nor such manifestation. \n=C2=A0\nNow a\ndays it has become a fashion to get ou=\r\nrselves associated with Kundalini yoga.\nExcept you, nobody can ever raise y=\r\nour kundalini energy. Even if you practice\nfor years, self realisation thro=\r\nugh kundalini yoga is ruled out, as there are\nno proper gurus. So, let us n=\r\not be under the impression that kundalini yoga\nwill pave the way for quick =\r\nself realisation. It is a misconcept. Realisation cannot be achieved quickl=\r\ny. It will take its own time, in many births. \n=C2=A0\nWhen\nwe start probing=\r\n deeper and deeper into our own self, we will first realise our\nconcern for=\r\n all living beings. We will start feeding the animals and birds with\nour ow=\r\nn hands. Then, we will start feeding the poor and hungry humans. Tears\nwill=\r\n roll down our eyes when we feel and see their happiness. If we decide to\nd=\r\no the feeding with pomp and vanity, we only add our bad karmas. If we decid=\r\ne\nto feed them through our servants, again there is no use. No doubt, their=\r\n\nhunger will be satisfied. But we will not get that everlasting happiness. =\r\nThis\nhappiness will subsequently blossom into eternal bliss. This is the fi=\r\nrst step\nin realisation. We cannot attain this stage by sitting in so calle=\r\nd meditation\nfor hours together. The ultimate stage in meditation is that w=\r\ne should be\nmeditating perpetually. We need no separate time to meditate. M=\r\neditation will\nbe happening always. So, in the initial stages of self reali=\r\nsation, we will\nhave concern for others. The concept of co-existence will b=\r\ne realised. This in\nturn will lead us to internal rejoice. We will take par=\r\nt in others happiness\nand sorrow. The hatred will not be there. Eternal lov=\r\ne will start engulfing us.\nWe all know that love is God. Then what next? Ho=\r\nw do we proceed further? \n=C2=A0\nFrom\nthe initial level we are now going to=\r\n move to the middle level.\nWe have learnt to love others, thereby making ou=\r\nr inner self to rejoice. Next\nstep is to focus our attention on some form. =\r\nWe should remember here that Brahmam\nis formless. But for the purpose of ou=\r\nr concentration and focus, let us\nmanifest some form of a deity, like Ramak=\r\nrishna Paramahamsa had done. We have\nto manifest a very clear form of the d=\r\neity, which is usually called =E2=80=9CIshta\nDevata=E2=80=9D. We can use ou=\r\nr imaginative power to give a form to this deity. For\nexample, the deity=E2=\r\n=80=99s complexion is blue. He or she has four or two hands. The\ncrown on t=\r\nhe head, the dress they wear, the weapons they hold and all such\nminute det=\r\nails. Constant and regular manifestation over a period of time will\nmake th=\r\ne deity real for us. By regularly practicing this manifestation, we can\nsta=\r\nrt two way communications with the deity. This is absolutely possible and\nd=\r\nepends upon the power of our sadhana (practice). Initially, we may not be a=\r\nble\nto decipher the communication from the deity. But over a period of time=\r\n, we can\nunderstand. Since, the deity is created by our own manifestation; =\r\nthe\ncommunication will be in a language known to us. Here the frequency and=\r\n\ndedication are very important. \nLet\nus understand that this is not the fin=\r\nal stage of realisation and only a middle\nlevel. Let us also not confuse be=\r\ntween Brahmam, which is Supreme and formless\nand our Ishta Devata, to whom =\r\nwe have given a form to our liking. \n=C2=A0\nThis\nmiddle level mainly emphas=\r\nizes on sadhana. We can also set specific times in a\nday to do this sadhana=\r\n. At least two sessions of half an hour a day is the\nminimum. Two things ar=\r\ne important. One is that our stomach should not be full.\nSecond, no disturb=\r\nance during this time. \n=C2=A0\nIf we\nare able to achieve our goals in the f=\r\nirst and the middle stages, the third and\nfinal stage of realizing the Brah=\r\nmam will be easier. This stage will be\ndiscussed subsequently.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n=C2=A0\nTHE\nFINAL DESTINATION \n=C2=A0\nAfter\nthoroughly understanding the=\r\n first two stages, we have to enter into the third\nstage. We have already s=\r\neen that Ishta Devata is important in one=E2=80=99s spiritual\nprogress. Thi=\r\ns Ishta Devata alone will take us to the ultimate stage. Ishta\nDevata is li=\r\nke a Guru. We will get instructions from Ishta Devata quite often,\nwhen we =\r\nare nearing the final stage. So what is this final stage? This is\nnothing b=\r\nut identifying ourselves with Brahman, the God. We have already learnt\nto i=\r\ndentify ourselves with our Ishta Devata, to whom we have a form. But\nBrahma=\r\nm does not have a form. He is the cause of the creation of the Universe.\nWe=\r\n have to identify ourselves with the formless, which is by no means an easy=\r\n\ntask. \n=C2=A0\nThe\nfirst thing in the final stage is understand the clear d=\r\nistinction between the\nBrahman and the maya. We have already seen that maya=\r\n is surrounding the Brahman\nas a sheath. So, for knowing the Brahman we hav=\r\ne to go past this sheath. Maya\ncontrols all our deeds and actions. It makes=\r\n us to laugh and cry. But Brahman\ndoes not act. You can know a table as tab=\r\nle on seeing the table, as it has a\nform. The knowing a table as a table is=\r\n the work of Maya, the illusion. But in\nthe case of the Brahman, we have to=\r\n realise something that is the Supreme in\nthis universe which does not have=\r\n a form. We have to visualize the form\nof the formless. How do we go about =\r\nit? =E2=80=9CAham Brahmam asmi=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Ctat\ntwam asi=E2=80=9D =\r\nare the two famous sayings from the Vedas. Both have the same\nmeaning. Aham=\r\n means =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99. Asmi means existing. Te literal meaning is =\r\n=E2=80=9CI am\nexisting as Brahmam=E2=80=9D. Tat means =E2=80=98that=E2=80=\r\n=99. Twam means =E2=80=98you=E2=80=99. Asi means existing.\nThe literal mean=\r\ning is =E2=80=9Cyou are existing as that=E2=80=9D. Here =E2=80=98that=E2=80=\r\n=99 means Brahmam. \n=C2=A0\nThe\ninitial two stages help us here. The first s=\r\ntage is the universal love, the\nconcern for others. The second stage is sad=\r\nhana with manifestation. The third and\nfinal stage is realizing us as God. =\r\nUnless somebody has gone through the first\ntwo stages meticulously, the fin=\r\nal stage is just not possible. \n=C2=A0\nNow\nlet us enter into the final stag=\r\ne. The first thing in the final stage is to get\naway from the attachment. T=\r\nhe =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 concept should be completely taken away from\nyour co=\r\nnsciousness. If we have leftover ego, nothing will work for us. We must\ndev=\r\nelop the attitude that God will take care of everything. We must also\nunder=\r\nstand that whatever one does, that will be the will of God only. The\naction=\r\ns are controlled by the God and not by the individual. If somebody hurts\nus=\r\n, we should think that the God has decided to hurt us at this appointed tim=\r\ne\nand the God has done that act of hurting through that person. In the fina=\r\nl\nstage only our mind alone need to work. There should be no thoughts in ou=\r\nr mind\nother than the thought of the form of the formless. The absolute pur=\r\nity of our\nmind is essential. Even a small distraction will spoil everythin=\r\ng. That is why\nduring this period ancient saints went to mountains and fore=\r\nsts just to focus\ntheir attention on Brahman. It is extremely difficult to =\r\nfocus on something\nthat does not have a form. Only at this stage the true m=\r\neditation is to be\npracticed. For a true meditation, no particular posture =\r\nis required. We can lie\ndown on the floor and meditate. The form of the Ish=\r\nta Devata, our Guru should\ndisappear. There will me no more Guru. No more t=\r\neaching. No more chanting. No\nmore rituals. We need to do nothing. From her=\r\ne on every activity will be\ndifferent for each individual. It bill be nothi=\r\nng but total bliss; total\nananda, the Oneness. \n=C2=A0\nOnce\nwe follow these=\r\n principles, the exact realisation will happen at any time and\nwill take on=\r\nly a few seconds. Only for these few seconds, we have to take so\nmany birth=\r\ns. From the moment of realisation, we will be different. We will not\nbe jus=\r\nt humans. We will be part of Creation. We will merge with Him. But please\nu=\r\nnderstand that we can only merge with Him and not become God. God is all\nal=\r\none. He does not need anybody. \n\nFrom this moment onwards, we can pray for =\r\nothers. What ever we say will come\ntrue. For a moment if our ego takes over=\r\n, everything will be lost. We have then\nto undergo the ordeal of births aft=\r\ner births. We live like others, we do\neverything like others. But we are di=\r\nfferent. The bliss will be reflected in\nour body. Body will shine. Our spee=\r\nch will be different. We will not take\ncredit for anything. Now one can say=\r\n =E2=80=9CAham Brahmam asmi=E2=80=9D.

Now let us discuss its\nimpleme=\r\nntation. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147Mso=\r\nNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;Meditation\nis the entry door f=\r\nor self-realisation. Normally, when we sit for meditation,\nwe make so many =\r\npreparations, like breathing exercises, bending and stretching\nexercises, e=\r\ntc. We begin our meditation, as if God is going to appear before\nus. No, Go=\r\nd will never appear before us. As we have seen in self-realisation,\nwe have=\r\n to realise the Brahmam by destroying maya. &lt;u&gt;The first step in\nmeditation=\r\n is to question ourselves.&lt;/u&gt; This is Ramana Maharishi=E2=80=99s teaching.=\r\n\nWe have to enquire =E2=80=9Cwho I am=E2=80=9D. Think about our origin, how=\r\n we had come to this\nearth, who would have created us and why we have come =\r\nto this earth. It is\ndifficult to find answers to these questions in the be=\r\nginning. But when we\nprobe deep into our self, we will get answers one by o=\r\nne. Only after getting\nanswers for these questions, we can think of realizi=\r\nng the Brahmam. During\nthis, we need not necessarily look into the basic as=\r\npects of meditation. When\nwe are set to seriously think about the cause of =\r\nour existence in this earth,\nit is only the beginning of the process of rea=\r\nlisation. During these initial\nstages, we are neither going to drive away o=\r\nur thoughts, nor manifest anything.\nBagwan Ramakrishna Paramahamsa showed t=\r\nhe form of Mother Kali to Vivekananda.\nVivekananda did have the vision of t=\r\nhe Mother Kali. When we are talking of\nBrahman as the formless, how can Bag=\r\nwan Ramakrishna show the divine Mother in\nflesh and blood? That is because =\r\nof the power of manifestation of Ramakrishna\nParamahamsa. That kind of mani=\r\nfestation is extremely difficult for people like\nus, as we have our own kar=\r\nmas to perform. The utmost concentration is necessary\nfor such manifestatio=\r\nn. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;f=\r\nont-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpac=\r\ning&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;Now a\ndays it has become a fashion t=\r\no get ourselves associated with Kundalini yoga.\nExcept you, nobody can ever=\r\n raise your kundalini energy. Even if you practice\nfor years, self realisat=\r\nion through kundalini yoga is ruled out, as there are\nno proper gurus. So, =\r\nlet us not be under the impression that kundalini yoga\nwill pave the way fo=\r\nr quick self realisation. It is a misconcept. &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Realisation&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\ncan=\r\nnot be achieved quickly. It will take its own time, in many births. &lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:1=\r\n2.0pt;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;When\nwe start probing deeper and deeper into o=\r\nur own self, we will first realise our\nconcern for all living beings. We wi=\r\nll start feeding the animals and birds with\nour own hands. Then, we will st=\r\nart feeding the poor and hungry humans. Tears\nwill roll down our eyes when =\r\nwe feel and see their happiness. If we decide to\ndo the feeding with pomp a=\r\nnd vanity, we only add our bad karmas. If we decide\nto feed them through ou=\r\nr servants, again there is no use. No doubt, their\nhunger will be satisfied=\r\n. But we will not get that everlasting happiness. This\nhappiness will subse=\r\nquently blossom into eternal bliss. This is the first step\nin realisation. =\r\nWe cannot attain this stage by sitting in so called meditation\nfor hours to=\r\ngether. The ultimate stage in meditation is that we should be\nmeditating pe=\r\nrpetually. We need no separate time to meditate. Meditation will\nbe happeni=\r\nng always. So, in the initial stages of self realisation, we will\nhave conc=\r\nern for others. The concept of co-existence will be realised. This in\nturn =\r\nwill lead us to internal rejoice. We will take part in others happiness\nand=\r\n sorrow. The hatred will not be there. Eternal love will start engulfing us=\r\n.\nWe all know that love is God. Then what next? How do we proceed further? =\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;From\nthe initial level we are now going=\r\n to move to the &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;middle level&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt;.\nWe have learnt to love others, =\r\nthereby making our inner self to rejoice. Next\nstep is to focus our attenti=\r\non on some form. We should remember here that &lt;b&gt;&lt;u&gt;Brahmam\nis formless&lt;/u&gt;=\r\n&lt;/b&gt;. But for the purpose of our concentration and focus, let us\nmanifest s=\r\nome form of a deity, like Ramakrishna Paramahamsa had done. We have\nto mani=\r\nfest a very clear form of the deity, which is usually called =E2=80=9CIshta=\r\n\nDevata=E2=80=9D. We can use our imaginative power to give a form to this d=\r\neity. For\nexample, the deity=E2=80=99s complexion is blue. He or she has fo=\r\nur or two hands. The\ncrown on the head, the dress they wear, the weapons th=\r\ney hold and all such\nminute details. Constant and regular manifestation ove=\r\nr a period of time will\nmake the deity real for us. By regularly practicing=\r\n this manifestation, we can\nstart two way communications with the deity. Th=\r\nis is absolutely possible and\ndepends upon the power of our sadhana (practi=\r\nce). Initially, we may not be able\nto decipher the communication from the d=\r\neity. But over a period of time, we can\nunderstand. Since, the deity is cre=\r\nated by our own manifestation; the\ncommunication will be in a language know=\r\nn to us. Here the frequency and\ndedication are very important. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt=\r\n;&quot;&gt;Let\nus understand that this is not the final stage of realisation and on=\r\nly a middle\nlevel.

We can also set specific times in a\nday to do this sadhana=\r\n. At least two sessions of half an hour a day is the\nminimum. Two things ar=\r\ne important. One is that our stomach should not be full.\nSecond, no disturb=\r\nance during this time. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpaci=\r\nng&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yi=\r\nv8758927147MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;If we\nare able t=\r\no achieve our goals in the first and the middle stages, the third and\nfinal=\r\n stage of realizing the Brahmam will be easier.

We have already seen that Ishta Devata is important in on=\r\ne=E2=80=99s spiritual\nprogress. This Ishta Devata alone will take us to the=\r\n ultimate stage. Ishta\nDevata is like a Guru. We will get instructions from=\r\n Ishta Devata quite often,\nwhen we are nearing the final stage. So what is =\r\nthis final stage? This is\nnothing but identifying ourselves with Brahman, t=\r\nhe God. We have already learnt\nto identify ourselves with our Ishta Devata,=\r\n to whom we have a form. But\nBrahmam does not have a form. He is the cause =\r\nof the creation of the Universe.\nWe have to identify ourselves with the for=\r\nmless, which is by no means an easy\ntask. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8=\r\n758927147MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt=\r\n;&quot;&gt;The\nfirst thing in the final stage is understand the clear distinction b=\r\netween the\nBrahman and the maya. We have already seen that maya is surround=\r\ning the Brahman\nas a sheath. So, for knowing the Brahman we have to go past=\r\n this sheath. Maya\ncontrols all our deeds and actions. It makes us to laugh=\r\n and cry. But Brahman\ndoes not act. You can know a table as table on seeing=\r\n the table, as it has a\nform. The knowing a table as a table is the work of=\r\n Maya, the illusion. But in\nthe case of the Brahman, we have to realise som=\r\nething that is the Supreme in\nthis universe which does not have a form. &lt;b&gt;=\r\n&lt;u&gt;We have to visualize the form\nof the formless.&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/b&gt; How do we go abou=\r\nt it? =E2=80=9CAham Brahmam asmi=E2=80=9D and =E2=80=9Ctat\ntwam asi=E2=80=\r\n=9D are the two famous sayings from the Vedas. Both have the same\nmeaning. =\r\nAham means =E2=80=98I am=E2=80=99. Asmi means existing. Te literal meaning =\r\nis =E2=80=9CI am\nexisting as Brahmam=E2=80=9D. Tat means =E2=80=98that=E2=\r\n=80=99. Twam means =E2=80=98you=E2=80=99. Asi means existing.\nThe literal m=\r\neaning is =E2=80=9Cyou are existing as that=E2=80=9D. Here =E2=80=98that=E2=\r\n=80=99 means Brahmam. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacin=\r\ng&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv=\r\n8758927147MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;The\ninitial two s=\r\ntages help us here. The first stage is the universal love, the\nconcern for =\r\nothers. The second stage is sadhana with manifestation. The third and\nfinal=\r\n stage is realizing us as God. Unless somebody has gone through the first\nt=\r\nwo stages meticulously, the final stage is just not possible. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt;=\r\n&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;Now\nlet us enter into the final stage. The first thi=\r\nng in the final stage is to get\naway from the attachment. The =E2=80=98I=E2=\r\n=80=99 concept should be completely taken away from\nyour consciousness. If =\r\nwe have leftover ego, nothing will work for us. We must\ndevelop the attitud=\r\ne that God will take care of everything. We must also\nunderstand that whate=\r\nver one does, that will be the will of God only. The\nactions are controlled=\r\n by the God and not by the individual. If somebody hurts\nus, we should thin=\r\nk that the God has decided to hurt us at this appointed time\nand the God ha=\r\ns done that act of hurting through that person. In the final\nstage only our=\r\n mind alone need to work. There should be no thoughts in our mind\nother tha=\r\nn the thought of the form of the formless. The absolute purity of our\nmind =\r\nis essential. Even a small distraction will spoil everything. That is why\nd=\r\nuring this period ancient saints went to mountains and forests just to focu=\r\ns\ntheir attention on Brahman. It is extremely difficult to focus on somethi=\r\nng\nthat does not have a form. Only at this stage the true meditation is to =\r\nbe\npracticed. For a true meditation, no particular posture is required. We =\r\ncan lie\ndown on the floor and meditate. The form of the Ishta Devata, our G=\r\nuru should\ndisappear. There will me no more Guru. No more teaching. No more=\r\n chanting. No\nmore rituals. We need to do nothing. From here on every activ=\r\nity will be\ndifferent for each individual. It bill be nothing but total bli=\r\nss; total\nananda, the Oneness. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147Ms=\r\noNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:12.0pt;&quot;&gt;Once\nwe =\r\nfollow these principles, the exact realisation will happen at any time and\n=\r\nwill take only a few seconds. Only for these few seconds, we have to take s=\r\no\nmany births. From the moment of realisation, we will be different. We wil=\r\nl not\nbe just humans. We will be part of Creation. We will merge with Him. =\r\nBut please\nunderstand that we can only merge with Him and not become God. G=\r\nod is all\nalone. He does not need anybody. &lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;\n&lt;br clear=3D=\r\n&quot;none&quot;&gt;\nFrom this moment onwards, we can pray for others. What ever we say =\r\nwill come\ntrue. For a moment if our ego takes over, everything will be lost=\r\n. We have then\nto undergo the ordeal of births after births. We live like o=\r\nthers, we do\neverything like others. But we are different. The bliss will b=\r\ne reflected in\nour body. Body will shine. Our speech will be different. We =\r\nwill not take\ncredit for anything. Now one can say =E2=80=9CAham Brahmam as=\r\nmi=E2=80=9D. Those who realise\nthis become Brahman, that is merges with the=\r\n Brahman.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv8758927147MsoNoSpacing&quot;&gt;&lt;span
