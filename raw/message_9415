Suppose they become stup=\r\nid and decide to \n&quot;move&quot; that wall somewhere else. Suppose the house is the=\r\nn ruined by the river.\n=C2=A0\nIs it that I became wrathful because a wall w=\r\nith &quot;my \npicture&quot; painted on it was moved (suggesting that I am so attached=\r\n to that picture)? Or is it that I loved them, but they \nwere stupid enough=\r\n to remove their protection and paid for it?\n=C2=A0\n(2)\nThe word &quot;dhArI&quot; is=\r\n from the root &quot;dhR&quot;, which means to hold, maintain, preserve. The word &quot;dh=\r\nArI&quot; literally means one who holds things together. Dhaari Devi stands for =\r\nthe\n protective force that holds various complex forces in a delicate \nequi=\r\nlibrium. Because this temple contains the upper half of the torso \nand the =\r\nbottom half is worshipped at another location as &quot;Kaali&quot;, people may think =\r\nof her as Kaali. But the goddess who was moved is the goddess of protection=\r\n and balance. This is a case of withdrawal of protection in a delicate equi=\r\nlibrium rather than wrath, thought it may seem like the latter.\n=C2=A0\n(3) =\r\nSome deities like Kaali, Bhairavi, Dhoomavati etc may indeed by associated =\r\nwith fierce destruction. However, the stereotypical image some people may h=\r\nave of such deities as wrathful, out-of-control, irritable persons is inacc=\r\nurate.\n=C2=A0\nEveryday billions of cells in our bodies become useless. They=\r\n block other good cells from functioning. Body has an elaborate system to &quot;=\r\nkill&quot; them, flush them out of the system and recycle the elements in them, =\r\ni.e. create new cells. This is a natural process and one without which life=\r\n is will be far less pleasant/sustainable. The force behind this natural pr=\r\nocess is not irritable or angry. It is just something very thoughtful, wise=\r\n and elaborate. But, if we personify that force, its actions of killing bil=\r\nlions of cells and flushing them out may indeed make it look like an angry =\r\nand irritable person!\n=C2=A0\nDeities such as Kaali and Bhairavi are personi=\r\nfications of the forces behind this natural process of destruction, elimina=\r\ntion and recycling, within the &quot;macrocosm&quot;. Remove the stereotypes from you=\r\nr mind to gain a better understanding of these deities and genuine love for=\r\n them (and not fake love out of necessity and fear).\n=C2=A0\n(4) First of al=\r\nl, let us accept that shifting a temple that was established specifically f=\r\nor protecting this region was an unwise and bad karma. Yet, it is not 100% =\r\nclear whether what happened is a direct consequence. In this case, it may v=\r\nery well be. But the bigger point I want to make is that we do not really k=\r\nnow which karmaphala is arising from which karma. We often draw convenient =\r\nconclusions based on our beliefs, agendas and conditioning.\n=C2=A0\nFor exam=\r\nple, when hurricane Sandy happened in northeast US, some Christian conserva=\r\ntive commentators in US said that states that were legalizing gay marriage =\r\nwere facing the wrath of God! They probably believed it genuinely. It was p=\r\nerhaps perfectly logical for the image of &quot;god&quot; constructed in their own mi=\r\nnds to do it!! But, it may be a silly idea given the image of god construct=\r\ned in the mind of someone else.\n=C2=A0\nGod is infinite and un-knowable. We =\r\nall have an *evolving* finite image of god in our finite and conditioned mi=\r\nnds based on our own *evolving* sense of good and bad, strong and weak, des=\r\nirable and undesirable, etc. It is wise not to second guess god and associa=\r\nte specific karmas with specific karmaphalas, for we can never know with ce=\r\nrtainty.\n=C2=A0\nHaving said that, a bad karma can be avoided whether or not=\r\n it caused a specific karma phala or not!\n=C2=A0\n(5) Though everyday billio=\r\nns of new cells are created in our bodies, billions of old cells are killed=\r\n and flushed out and trillions of cells sustained, some periods before peri=\r\nodic rejuvenation bring more destruction than usual.\n=C2=A0\nI do believe th=\r\nat the world is going through such a &quot;Kaali phase&quot; right now. It probably w=\r\nill continue for another decade or less. However, relocation of a temple is=\r\n very small problem compared to bigger problems that the Mother of fine bal=\r\nance must handle in this world right now, to come up with a more sustainabl=\r\ne equilibrium!\n=C2=A0\nHuman beings are arrogantly and foolishly ruining the=\r\nir own environment, under the delusion that it is ok. A powerful minority i=\r\ns spreading unnatural and unsustainable lifestyles everywhere in the world,=\r\n under the delusion of speading &quot;civilization&quot; and &quot;development&quot;. The food =\r\npeople eat, the drinks people dump in their bodies and the air people breat=\r\nhe, are increasingly polluted with dangerous chemicals.\n=C2=A0\nIn the inter=\r\nest of the sustenance of earth and life on it, some drastic changes MUST be=\r\n made. The changes kicked off by the force of Kaali will continue to unrave=\r\nl over the years. It may be painful, but it may in the long run result in a=\r\n more sustainable equilibrium.\n=C2=A0\nDuring this phase, it may not be help=\r\nful or useful to put the microscope on specific events. It is better to dev=\r\nelop a balanced attitude of compassionate detachment and just pray for peac=\r\ne. Also, as more and more sadhakas do intense sadhana, it may smooth out so=\r\nme of the painful changes.\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrolog=\r\ny & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n\n\n&gt;________________________________\n&gt; From: &quot;ash_iitd@...&quot; &lt;ash_iitd@=\r\nyahoo.com&gt;\n&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;Sent: Friday, June 28, 2013 =\r\n2:32 PM\n&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Uttarakhand tragedy\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;R=\r\nespected Sir,\n&gt;I understand this quite well and in some way agrees with you=\r\n, but my doubt is still there?

But it is less apt, for the following reasons:\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;(1) The word &quot;=\r\ntu&quot; indicates some irony or contrast. If you say &quot;He rules the bridge of dh=\r\narma. Then again, he destroys the path of adharma&quot;, there is no such contra=\r\nst. Basically, I see &quot;tu&quot; as a misfit there.\n&gt;(2) Bhairava is not necessari=\r\nly a deity destroying adharma. In fact, he stands more for liberation and f=\r\nor destroying the distinction in one&#39;s mind between dharma and adharma. For=\r\n example, he is depicted as roaming around naked drinking wine.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;BT=\r\nW, observe the imagery. Line before says &quot;dharma setu pAlakaM&quot; - the ruler =\r\nof the bridge of dharma. Dharma is merely seen as a bridge here. Bridge to =\r\nwhat? Obviously bridge over the sea of samsara and into infinite freedom. B=\r\nhairava not only controls the bridge, but his main purpose is to take one i=\r\nnto infinite freedom from that bridge. Thus, swadharma mArga nAshakaM fits =\r\nnicely following that line.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;BTW, some people may be tempted to wor=\r\nship and Bhairava and emulate him by drinking wine or roaming naked in a sm=\r\nashan. That may not necessarily liberate one. Please note that Bhairava is =\r\nnot free becausehe drinks wine and roams naked. He is already free and does=\r\n those things becausehe is free. In any case, even Bhairava, the deity of d=\r\nestroying right-wrong distinctions in mind and ringing in liberation is des=\r\ncribed as &quot;dharma setu palaka&quot;! Dharma is very important. Until you reach t=\r\nhe shore of infinite freedom, you HAVE to stay afloat of the ocean of samsa=\r\nra, by getting atop the bridge of dharma! Otherwise you will sink in the oc=\r\nean of samara, toppled by the waves of delusion. Though one needs to jump o=\r\nff the bridge in the end, &quot;the end&quot; is not anywhere near for most people on=\r\n earth and they better realize it!\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;This is why I (@homam108) twe=\r\neted a few weeks back that moksha is irrelevant to 99.9999% people. Instead=\r\n of reading and thinking about moksha, think about dharma and do your dharm=\r\na.\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;--------\n&gt;Astrology & Spirituality =\r\nResources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;--------\n&gt;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;_______=\r\n_________________________\n&gt;&gt; From: Acharyulu &lt;acharyulug@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;To: v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;&gt;Sent: Thursday, June 6, 2013 12:13 AM\n&gt;&gt;Subj=\r\nect: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: doubt about svadharma\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;Dea=\r\nr Narasimha Garu,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0In many of the texts that I came acr=\r\noss it was &quot;twadharma maarga naasakam&quot;.

But he=\r\n also said in the last chapter &quot;Roundly give up all dharmas and surrender u=\r\nnto Me&quot;.

Eventually, one should be able to perfor=\r\nm swadharma without attachment to its fruits and later without even the sen=\r\nse of doership! Then comes a stage when one is not even attached to the ide=\r\na that &quot;this is my dharma. I must do this&quot;. Whatever Nature has placed one =\r\nin a position to do, one does it detachedly, with neither sadness/disappoin=\r\ntment nor with happiness/excitement, but with the spirit of &quot;this is what S=\r\nupreme Lord is doing through me at this instant&quot;. One overcomes the notions=\r\n that &quot;I am so and so. I need to do so and so&quot;, gives up one&#39;s own will and=\r\n flows like a light leaf in the wind of samsara. Wherever one flows and wha=\r\ntever objects one touches, one sees it as the will of Supreme Lord and has =\r\nno notions of one&#39;s own will or one&#39;s own duties. That is the state of libe=\r\nrated enlightenment.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Bhairava is extolled in Bhairavashtak=\r\nam as the one who brings that state. Krishna also teaches to get to that st=\r\nate, but he does so in the last chapter of Bhagavad Gita. Before you get th=\r\nere, however, you may have to follow the instructions in previous chapters!=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;A lot of modern Hindu philosophy taught by many modern gurus,=\r\n especially of the Vedantic bent, is based on the final target rather than =\r\nthe path(s) one needs to walk, to get to the target. It assumes that you ar=\r\ne already close to the target. It ends up misleading and creating wrong not=\r\nions in unprepared sadhakas like &quot;all is delusion&quot;, &quot;everything is the same=\r\n&quot;, &quot;what you do does not matter&quot;. The greatness of Bhagavad Gita is that it=\r\n talks about the path(s) as well as the target and has something relevant t=\r\no everyone.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Best regards,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Narasimha\n&gt;&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt;&gt;-----=\r\n---\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;________________________________\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; From: &lt;=\r\ndeleted&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;To: pvr108@... \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Sent: Wednesday, June 5, 2013 12:16 =\r\nPM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: doubt about svadharma\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;in gita krishna s=\r\nays follow svadharma, while in bhairava stotram by sankaracharya he is desc=\r\nribed as svadharma marga nashakam , could you please explain this conflict,=\r\n if you have the time.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\r\n--61789334-1756422807-1372609198=:70362\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv3099169944yui_3_7_=\r\n2_29_1372387466197_54&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv3099169944yui_3_7_2_29_1372387466197_=\r\n187&quot;&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;A 2 cents on a few different points rela=\r\nted to this topic.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yui_3_7_2_33_1372387466197=\r\n_56&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, hel=\r\nvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot; id=3D&quot;y=\r\niv3099169944yui_3_7_2_29_1372387466197_190&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv3099169944yui_3_=\r\n7_2_29_1372387466197_187&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv3099169944yui=\r\n_3_7_2_29_1372387466197_57 yui_3_7_2_33_1372387466197_58&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv30991699=\r\n44yui_3_7_2_29_1372387466197_58&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px=\r\n;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transpare=\r\nnt;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv3099169944yui_3_7_2_29_1372387466197_=\r\n187&quot;&gt;(1)\n Suppose some of my children are living in a house that is right n=\r\next to\n a big river and a big wall with my picture painted on it is protect=\r\ning the&nbsp;\nhouse from the river water. Suppose they become stupid and de=\r\ncide to \n&quot;move&quot; that wall somewhere else. Suppose the house is then ruined =\r\nby the\n river.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Is it that I became wrathful because a wall wit=\r\nh &quot;my \npicture&quot; painted on it was moved (suggesting that I am so attached t=\r\no that picture)? Or is it that I loved them, but they \nwere stupid enough t=\r\no remove their protection and paid for it?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;(2)\nThe word &quot;dhArI=\r\n&quot; is from the root &quot;dhR&quot;, which means to hold, maintain, preserve. The word=\r\n &quot;dhArI&quot; literally means one who holds things together. Dhaari Devi stands =\r\nfor the\n protective force that holds various complex forces in a delicate \n=\r\nequilibrium. Because this temple contains the upper half of the torso \nand =\r\nthe bottom half is worshipped at another location as &quot;Kaali&quot;, people may th=\r\nink of her as Kaali. But the goddess who was moved is the goddess of protec=\r\ntion and balance. This is a case of withdrawal of protection in a delicate =\r\nequilibrium rather than wrath, thought it may seem like the latter.&lt;br&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;br&gt;(3) Some deities like Kaali, Bhairavi, Dhoomavati etc may indeed by a=\r\nssociated with fierce destruction. However, the stereotypical image some pe=\r\nople may have of such deities as wrathful, out-of-control, irritable person=\r\ns is inaccurate.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Everyday billions of cells in our bodies beco=\r\nme useless. They block other good cells from functioning. Body has an elabo=\r\nrate system to &quot;kill&quot; them, flush them out of the system and recycle the el=\r\nements in them, i.e. create new cells. This is a natural process and one wi=\r\nthout which life is will be far less pleasant/sustainable. The force behind=\r\n this natural process is not irritable or angry. It is just\n something very=\r\n thoughtful, wise and elaborate. But, if we personify that force, its actio=\r\nns of killing billions of cells and flushing them out may indeed make it lo=\r\nok like an angry and irritable person!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Deities such as Kaali a=\r\nnd Bhairavi are personifications of the forces behind this natural process =\r\nof destruction, elimination and recycling, within the &quot;macrocosm&quot;. Remove t=\r\nhe stereotypes from your mind to gain a better understanding of these deiti=\r\nes and genuine love for them (and not fake love out of necessity and fear).=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;(4) First of all, let us accept that shifting a temple that w=\r\nas established specifically for protecting this region was an unwise and ba=\r\nd karma. Yet, it is not 100% clear whether what happened is a direct conseq=\r\nuence. In this case, it may very well be. But the bigger point I want to ma=\r\nke is that we do not really know which karmaphala is arising from which kar=\r\nma. We often draw convenient conclusions based on our\n beliefs, agendas and=\r\n conditioning.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;For example, when hurricane Sandy happened in n=\r\northeast US, some Christian conservative commentators in US said that state=\r\ns that were legalizing gay marriage were facing the wrath of God! They prob=\r\nably believed it genuinely. It was perhaps perfectly logical for the image =\r\nof &quot;god&quot; constructed in their own minds to do it!! But, it may be a silly i=\r\ndea given the image of god constructed in the mind of someone else.&lt;br&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;br&gt;God is infinite and un-knowable. We all have an *evolving* finite ima=\r\nge of god in our finite and conditioned minds based on our own *evolving* s=\r\nense of good and bad, strong and weak, desirable and undesirable, etc. It i=\r\ns wise not to second guess god and associate specific karmas with specific =\r\nkarmaphalas, for we can never know with certainty.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Having said=\r\n that, a bad karma can be avoided whether or not it caused a specific karma=\r\n phala or not!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;(5) Though everyday\n billions of new cells are =\r\ncreated in our bodies, billions of old cells are killed and flushed out and=\r\n trillions of cells sustained, some periods &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv309916994=\r\n4yui_3_7_2_29_1372387466197_187&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv3099169944yui_3_7_2_29_1372=\r\n387466197_187&quot;&gt;before periodic rejuvenation bring &lt;/span&gt;more destruction t=\r\nhan usual.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I do believe that the world is going through such a=\r\n &quot;Kaali phase&quot; right now. It probably will continue for another decade or l=\r\ness. However, relocation of a temple is very small problem compared to bigg=\r\ner problems that the Mother of fine balance must handle in this world right=\r\n now, to come up with a more sustainable equilibrium!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Human be=\r\nings are arrogantly and foolishly ruining their own environment, under the =\r\ndelusion that it is ok. A powerful minority is spreading unnatural and unsu=\r\nstainable lifestyles everywhere in the world, under the delusion of speadin=\r\ng &quot;civilization&quot; and &quot;development&quot;. The food\n people eat, the drinks people=\r\n dump in their bodies and the air people breathe, are increasingly polluted=\r\n with dangerous chemicals.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In the interest of the sustenance o=\r\nf earth and life on it, some drastic changes MUST be made. The changes kick=\r\ned off by the force of Kaali will continue to unravel over the years. It ma=\r\ny be painful, but it may in the long run result in a more sustainable equil=\r\nibrium.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;During this phase, it may not be helpful or useful to =\r\nput the microscope on specific events. It is better to develop a balanced a=\r\nttitude of compassionate detachment and just pray for peace. Also, as more =\r\nand more sadhakas do intense sadhana, it may smooth out some of the painful=\r\n changes.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Ast=\r\nrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div\n class=3D&quot;yiv3099169944yui_3_7_2_29_1372387466197_59 yui_3_7_2_3=\r\n3_1372387466197_59&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv3099169944yui_3_7_2_29_1372387466197_60&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, =\r\nsans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;/s=\r\npan&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 12px=\r\n; font-family: Arial; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal; fo=\r\nnt-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 2=\r\n55); margin-left: 5px; margin-top: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;  &lt;div style=3D=\r\n&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new york, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;=\r\n&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;ash_iitd@...&quot; &lt;a=\r\nsh_iitd@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span\n style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;=\r\n&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Friday, June 28, 2013 2:32 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font=\r\n-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Uttarakhand tragedy&lt;=\r\nbr&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;div class=3D&quot;y_msg_container&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv6077629=\r\n048&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n   =\r\n &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv6077629048ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRespec=\r\nted Sir,&lt;br&gt;I understand this quite well and in some way agrees with you, b=\r\nut my doubt is still there?

In fact, he stands more for liberation and for des=\r\ntroying the distinction &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;in one&#39;s mind &lt;/span&gt;between dha=\r\nrma and adharma. For example, he is depicted as roaming around naked drinki=\r\nng wine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;f=\r\nont-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-s=\r\ntyle:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);fon=\r\nt-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:=\r\ntransparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;BTW, observe the imagery. Line before=\r\n\n says\n &quot;dharma setu pAlakaM&quot; - the ruler of the bridge of dharma. Dharma i=\r\ns merely seen as a bridge here. Bridge to what? Obviously bridge over the s=\r\nea of samsara and into infinite freedom. Bhairava not only controls the bri=\r\ndge, but his main purpose is to take one into infinite freedom from that br=\r\nidge. Thus, swadharma mArga nAshakaM fits nicely following that line.&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:ari=\r\nal, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333=\r\npx;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;fo=\r\nnt-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;BTW, some people may be tempted to worship and Bhai=\r\nrava and emulate him by drinking wine or roaming naked in a smashan. That m=\r\nay not necessarily liberate one. Please note that Bhairava is not free &lt;spa=\r\nn style=3D&quot;font-style:italic;&quot;&gt;because&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; he drinks wine\n and roa=\r\nms naked. He is already free and does those things &lt;span style=3D&quot;font-styl=\r\ne:italic;&quot;&gt;because&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt; he is free.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In any case, even=\r\n Bhairava, the deity of destroying right-wrong distinctions in mind and rin=\r\nging in liberation is described as &quot;dharma setu palaka&quot;! Dharma is very imp=\r\nortant. Until you reach the shore of infinite freedom, you HAVE to stay afl=\r\noat of the ocean of samsara, by getting atop the bridge of dharma! Otherwis=\r\ne you will sink in the ocean of samara, toppled by the waves of delusion. T=\r\nhough one needs to jump off the bridge in the end, &quot;the end&quot; is not anywher=\r\ne near for most people on earth and they better realize it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;font-family:arial, he=\r\nlvetica, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13.3333px;fon=\r\nt-family:arial, helvetica,\n sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-st=\r\nyle:normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;This is why I (@homam108) tweeted a few weeks back that =\r\nmoksha is irrelevant to 99.9999% people.
