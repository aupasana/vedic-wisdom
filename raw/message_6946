However, I have some questions and comments. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; 1. W=\r\nhile I have no doubt about your point that castes are portable and not dete=\r\nrmined by birth is a very valid one and hard to argue about, example of Vis=\r\nhwamitra is a far better one than that of Valmiki! The reason being, as Sri=\r\n Chaganti Koteshwara Rao, an eminent scholar in his 42 day Ramayana Pravach=\r\nanam says, Valmiki is not a tribal by birth but he is Son of Prachetana, a =\r\nbrahmin of Bharadwajasa Gotra and his name was Agni Sarma! How he became a =\r\nhunter and eventually became a great sage is a different story but I believ=\r\ned that he=C2=A0was not a sudra by birth, based on his lectures. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; 2. Also he goes on to say that his Disciple Bharadwaja is not the same as=\r\n the Bharadwaja of Saptarishi set! Agni Sarma himself (Valmiki&#39;s original n=\r\name) is of Bharadwajasa Gotra, according to him! It is quite possible that =\r\neven in olden days, different people shared the same name! I would like to =\r\nhear your views on this. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I am completely in agreement that homa=\r\nm is a very powerful sadhana and ever since I started doing it daily ( from=\r\n the last fifteen days), I can see that my confidence in handling everythin=\r\ng has increased manifold! I am just doing Ganapathi homam along with Sandhy=\r\na vandanam and I find this practise a pretty beautiful one. But I am not ab=\r\nle to control my anger at all! I am very short tempered person and cannot t=\r\nolerate delays and keep yelling at my kids and wife a lot! I am not seeing =\r\nthat homam is helping me there, but I just enjoy the ritual itself and keep=\r\n thinking that my clarity is increasing because of this. I had quite a few =\r\nmaterial setbacks but keep thing that my bad karma is getting burnt and nev=\r\ner doubted the positive effects of homam for a minute! Please let me know i=\r\nf my thinking is right!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Nagraj\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 7/21/11, Nara=\r\nsimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] RE: Non Brahmin,Completed 108 Ganapathi Homams --Do=\r\nnt you think this is Guru Krupa?\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date:=\r\n Thursday, July 21, 2011, 2:01 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Sri=\r\nnivas,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I am glad you are doing homam and overcame drinking, smok=\r\ning etc. It is very inspiring and can inspire others too to overcome weakne=\r\nsses. Overcoming external weaknesses such as drinking, smoking, drugs etc a=\r\nnd internal weaknesses such as lust, anger, jealosy etc, is the true sign o=\r\nf one&#39;s progress with a sadhana. You are definitely on the right path and k=\r\neep going!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As Vimalananda says, nature conspires to help one who=\r\n truly wants to learn and do a sadhana!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; As some people have already pointed out, one&#39;s varna is decided by on=\r\ne&#39;s aptitude and attitude. Valmiki must&#39;ve been a great brahmin in previous=\r\n lives, but some karmas made him take birth as a shoodra and eventually his=\r\n original samskaras took over and he became a brahmin, a rishi and a mahars=\r\nhi. He even taught brahma jnana to Bharadwaja, one of the saptarshis!\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; Similarly, if one is drawn to fire, does homam over a period of time =\r\nand overcomes some weaknesses, obviously strong samskaras are present from =\r\nprevious lives. If they are allowed to dominate, one will make progress. On=\r\ne becomes a true brahmana with sadhana. As one realizes true knowledge inte=\r\nrnally, one may even become worthy of teaching spiritual knowledge to other=\r\ns, including brahmanas by birth!\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Not o=\r\nnly non-brahmins from India, but people not born in India/Hinduism are doin=\r\ng homam regularly. Some of them are (will be) making great progess too. As =\r\na result, a strong Brahmin (true!) class will be established across the wor=\r\nld and that will increase dharma on earth.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Just yesterday night,=\r\n one Russian origin CS professor from Canada who was in Boston as a visitin=\r\ng scholar at MIT came to my house and learned homam. He did Ganapathi homam=\r\n at my house with my help and plans to do it in Canada. He has Jupiter in P=\r\nisces in 12th house and I got a nice feeling when he was doing homam. There=\r\n were also several good omens, making me think he is relatively well-prepar=\r\ned for sadhana.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; A dirty golden vessel is more valuable than a br=\r\nightly shining copper vessel that is gold-plated! You just need to clean th=\r\ne former..\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; This homam movement is in=\r\n nascent stages yet. Once a critical mass of sadhakas accumulates and peopl=\r\ne start making progress, it will spread like a wildfire. There is no hurry =\r\nand there is need to feel pressure, for these things happen due to the will=\r\n of higher beings. We are all merely instruments.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I tend to thin=\r\nk that there are blessings of some great saints/yogis behind this. When we =\r\ndid Shata Chandi homam at Chennai in March 2006, we casually selected a muh=\r\nurta for the sankalpa of the week-long ritual, so that maha-poornahuti happ=\r\nens on an Ashtami day. It was during this week that Manish received a comma=\r\nnd from the divine Mother to spread homam. When I and Manish took the sanka=\r\nlpa at the temple on the first day, it was Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s lunar =\r\nbirthday and it was within 5 min from the exact time when the angle between=\r\n Sun and Moon matched that at his birth. When I started daily homam about 5=\r\n-6 months later, as a precursor to publishing the manuals a few months late=\r\nr, there was another coincidence. It was exactly 120 lunar years since Rama=\r\nkrishna left his physical body. Moreover, I had a vision of Ramakrishna Par=\r\namahamsa a day before Manish had the vision of divine Mother, during that w=\r\neek of Shata Chandi at the Kali temple in Chennai. I\n&gt;  am not attached to =\r\nforms and I rarely get visions.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Several months before that, in l=\r\nate 2005, I had an interesting dream that actually felt real (i.e. not like=\r\n a dream). In the dream, there was a strong and pleasant naad (buzz) that u=\r\nsed to accompany my Kundalini rises through sushumna during those days. It =\r\nwas dark and there was a huge fire. I was sitting in front of the fire. A p=\r\nerson with a powerful persona, whom I had never seen before, sat in front o=\r\nf me. He was teaching me some yoga involving fire and what yoga means etc. =\r\nHe taught several things in Sanskrit. Suddenly he changed into Manish. Then=\r\n shakti came down, naad stopped, &quot;dream&quot; ended, and I was aware of my body =\r\nlying on bed. The face of the person I saw was vivid in my mind. I did not =\r\nknow who it was. I mentioned this dream to Manish a week or two later. He s=\r\naid he did not know who it was, but asked me a week later to check out the =\r\nphoto of a specific yogi. When I did a search on the internet, I found a ph=\r\noto (apparently the only photo\n&gt;  available of that yogi). It looked very c=\r\nlose to what I saw in my dream, except that the person in my dream seemed l=\r\nike a slightly younger version of that photo. This was a famous yogi from t=\r\nhe parampara of Mahavatar Babaji. As I had never seen his photo before that=\r\n or read much about that lineage or their teachings, his coming in my dream=\r\n was strange. Also, teaching me some yoga involving fire was strange, becau=\r\nse homam movement did not start then and I was not thinking of fire or fire=\r\n ritual at all.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; There are some signs like this, which make me th=\r\nink that we are being used as instruments in a big &quot;project&quot; designed by so=\r\nme great yogis in higher realms. It seems to me like this project has an im=\r\nportant purpose and will help MANY people in their quest for god, in the co=\r\nming decades and centuries.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =C2=A0 Free J=\r\nyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot;=\r\n ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that=\r\n make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Sp=\r\nirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =C2=A0 Jyotish wri=\r\ntings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -----------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; On Thu, Ju=\r\nl 21, 2011 at 4:42 AM, srinivas wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0 Hi: \n&gt; \n&gt; I am a n=\r\non Brahmin, fortunately I came across Homam manuals/videos in internet.
