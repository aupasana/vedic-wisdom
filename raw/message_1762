Individual mind is represented by \nMoon. When the light of the soul is visible fully, it is the day spiritually \nspeaking. When the light of the soul is not visible fully and visible in an \nindirect way as reflected by the mind (just as Sun&#39;s light is reflected by \nMoon), it is the night spiritually speaking.\n\nWhen the mind is absorbed in all attractions and repulsions, nice sense \nexperiences, pleasures and pains etc and one is unable to see true Self in \nall, light of the soul is not reaching one and a limited amount of that \nlight is reaching one as reflected by the mind. Spiritually speaking, this \nis a night.\n\nYes, veda mantras are better read at day than at night. But the day and \nnight meant there are as above. If one&#39;s self-awareness is completely \nthrough the relfective mind which is caught in sense experiences and has \nonly a limited understanding of the universe, then one will not be able to \nexperience or understand veda mantras and most higher mantras. Only one \ntranscending sense experiences and having a higher self-awareness is living \nin spiritual &quot;daytime&quot; will be able to experience and understand veda \nmantras.\n\nThis way, most people are living in dark night all the time and unable to \nexperience or understand veda mantras.\n\nWhether it is daytime or night time physically matters very little. If night \ntime is convenient for you, I suggest not worrying and reading/listening to \nveda mantras at night.\n\nPractically speaking, there is a caveat: If there is ANY sense of guilt or \nyour mind has a sense that you are doing something wrong, then don&#39;t do it. \nThat sense of guilt will corrupt everything. If you can genuinely convince \nyourself that there is nothing wrong it, then do it.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;kritels&quot; &lt;kritels@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Wednesday, April 29, 2009 2:54 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Reading of Mantras during night time\n\n\n&gt; Sri Narasimha Garu and Others,\n&gt;\n&gt; Can we read the Veda mantras during the night time?\n&gt;\n&gt; Typically in today&#39;s busy world we are all occupied with work during most \n&gt; of the day. Before sleeping, if one wishes to do some japa mentally with a \n&gt; veda mantra wil it be fine?\n&gt; Are there any restrictions on the kind of dieties that one should not be \n&gt; performing during the night time ( i remember Narasimha cautioning earlier \n&gt; from performing chandi homam during the night). In general any \n&gt; pre-cautions are to be taken if we have to read/do japa with veda mantra \n&gt; during the night time.\n&gt;\n&gt; Can i read veda mantras while sleeping on bed? (not in a casual way by any \n&gt; means)\n&gt;\n&gt; I some times put on the some vedic chants during night and while listening \n&gt; to them sleep, the chants go on till the morning until i wakes up again. \n&gt; Is this is an acceptable way?\n&gt;\n&gt; Kindly give me your thoughts on this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; KK\n\n\n"}}
