It was in \n2006 that I had been doing the japa of a certain mantra for a=\r\nlmost the \nwhole year. I had come across the mantra in a strange way, but n=\r\none \nthe less I kept chanting the mantra. The deity is Lord Bhairav. \n\nAt t=\r\nhe end of that year suddenly due to some events I got an chance to \nvisit t=\r\nhe kumb mela as well as the Kal Bhairav and Vatuk Bhairav \ntemples in Kasi.=\r\n After I came back from there, I wanted to learn how \nto do a homa, but I c=\r\nould not find anyone to teach me the same. So one \nday I decided on doing a=\r\n homa in my own way, which I realized after \nreading your homa manuals, was=\r\n ridden with innumerable mistakes. \n\nThe basic procedure I followed was dra=\r\nwing the yantra of the deity in \nthe homa kunda, then praying to my deity, =\r\nLord Ganapati and the Divine \nMother to forgive all mistakes. And next I wo=\r\nuld straight away start \noff with the main mantra and its ahuti in fire. Th=\r\nat used to me the \nmajor part of the homa. And I loved watching the peculia=\r\nr behaviour of \nthe fire in the homa kunda. \n\nI had done this kind of (comp=\r\nletely wrong) homa at least ten/fifteen \ntimes in the last one year.. \n\nAft=\r\ner reading the homa manuals I have understood the innumerable \nmistakes tha=\r\nt I had done in the name of doing a homa. But somehow I \nliked the experine=\r\nces very much. \n\nI wanted to ask you, can I continue the way I was doing or=\r\n is there \nsomething I need to do to rectify all the mistakes that I have \n=\r\ncommited till now.. Waiting for your guidance..\n\n-Regards\n Rajarshi\n\n\n\n\n"}}
