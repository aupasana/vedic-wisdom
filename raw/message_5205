Th=\r\ne greater sign of evolution is invention of the square.\n\nMany have seen and=\r\n seen a lot in the artefacts of Harappa. There are bulls, heifers, oxen, ho=\r\nrns, fish, crabs, ligatured animals - What is significantly missing is the =\r\ncow!! And for that matter female signs are very very few. WHY?\n\nIs this a c=\r\nase of male dominance and gender discrimination. Yes it is. Why, I think th=\r\nat is and was the pattern in vaidik study - meaning sanskrit study. I think=\r\n the seals are convoction degree certificates and the finds are from ancien=\r\nt university sites. In which was taught science, pure and applied science a=\r\nnd technology.\n\nGiven the security and hardship reasons of those days it sh=\r\nould be understandable of the relative rarity of the females in vaidika cer=\r\nemony and yaj~ja. However it was amply made up in day day to day lives and =\r\nout side the university / ashrams in temples and families.\n\nThere is a figu=\r\nre with three horns - those that do not know sanskrit can never guess what =\r\nit is - Agni (fire) is atrributed the name trishru~gga. \n\nregards\n\n\n\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
