I want to mention a small story about his p=\r\nast. This is an incident that had a profound impact on his spiritual evolut=\r\nion in this life.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhen Manish was young, he was not=\r\n exactly spiritual. His mother was highly spiritual and religious and he na=\r\nturally knew some prayers, but did not do much spiritual sadhana. He would =\r\nrace motor bikes outside Pune with friends and lead a licentious lifestyle.=\r\n\n \nWhen in college, he got bad marks in one subject in exams and wanted to =\r\ngo to college oneday to fight and increase his marks. When he was about to =\r\nleave house, a teenaged Brahmin in orange clothes and having good tejas in =\r\nface came to his house. He asked Manish where he was going. He then said, &quot;=\r\ndo not go out today. Going out today will ruin your life. Just stay home an=\r\nd think of god. I will make sure that your marks with be increased. Leave i=\r\nt to me and don&#39;t worry about it.&quot; He then strongly suggested to Manish tha=\r\nt he should wear a diamond ring on his right hand index finger and it would=\r\n change his life. Interestingly, Manish has Meena lagna and Venus is a male=\r\nfic for him. Though Venus is in Thula (8th house) with 3 other planets, peo=\r\nple would normally avoid diamond in this case to be safe. Moreover, most pe=\r\nople do not put diamond on index finger, which is associated with Jupiter, =\r\nan enemy of Venus. So nobody would normally recommend him diamond, that too=\r\n on the index finger. This is an unusual suggestion.\n \nThat brahmin boy the=\r\nn asked Manish to give him tea or sugar with his hand and said that this ac=\r\nt would do him good. There was no tea at their house and Manish fed him som=\r\ne sugar. He ate it and left after saying, &quot;when you come to Shirdi next, co=\r\nme to so and so room in so and so place. That is where I live. Also, I need=\r\n to give a glass of water to your mother. Please come to Shirdi with her.&quot;\n=\r\n \n*        *        *\n \nBarely a minute after he left, Manish had a questio=\r\nn and ran to the door of his compound wall. He found no person in orange cl=\r\nothes walking on the road. He asked the persons standing outside whether th=\r\ney could tell him in which direction a person who came out of the house in =\r\norange clothes had gone. They said nobody went in or came out of the house =\r\nin an hour. Manish went around the area to check if anybody saw a young Bra=\r\nhmin in orange clothes. Nobody in that area saw anyone like that. So this s=\r\neemed like a miracle. Manish was puzzled.\n \nLater his marks in the exam wer=\r\ne automatically increased and his problem was solved by itself, without his=\r\n doing anything.\n \n*        *        *\n \nA few months later, they went to S=\r\nhirdi. They wanted to meet that young Brahmin. They went to the place he me=\r\nntioned. Manish&#39;s mother was waiting downstairs and they went upstairs to t=\r\nhe room number mentioned by him to find out. Surprisingly, there was nobody=\r\n in that room and there was a life size picture of Shirdi Sai Baba on a wal=\r\nl. When they asked, they were told that that room had always been empty and=\r\n only the picture was there. Nobody ever lived in that room.\n \nWhen they ca=\r\nme downstairs, Manish&#39;s mother told them that she suddenly became very thir=\r\nsty and a young man in white clothes came, made her drink some water from h=\r\nis hands and left in a hurry.\n \n*        *        *\n \nAfter this, Manish di=\r\nd buy a diamond ring as suggested by the divine visitor and wore it on his =\r\nright hand index finger. He still wears it. Perhaps wearing a strong moksha=\r\n trikona lord&#39;s gem on the moksha finger (the four fingers represent the 4 =\r\npurusharthas and thumb shows self) strengthens moksha trikona. Though this =\r\nwas an unusual (and risky) suggestion, perhaps this is very appropriate in =\r\nthis case for spiritual progress.\n \nSoon after this, another miraculous inc=\r\nident involving a deity happened, which I do not want to mention now. Then =\r\nstarted his spiritual transformation. Manish became very serious about spir=\r\nitual sadhana after that and started spending many hours everyday in spirit=\r\nual sadhana. He had visions - internal and external - of many deities and s=\r\npecial beings, including Shirdi Sai Baba too, and had many experiences. His=\r\n life changed completely after this experience.\n \n*        *        *\n \nTod=\r\nay many people do not believe that miraculous and magical things can happen=\r\n. When they hear unbelievable stories about saints like Sai Baba, Raghavend=\r\nra Swami, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swami, Mahavatar Babaji, Jnanes=\r\nhwar Maharaj etc, the modern minds trained in rational thinking assume that=\r\n the stories are made up by someone. Healthy skepticism is justified becaus=\r\ne many fake people are there today, who abuse people&#39;s faith. However, abso=\r\nlute cynicism is wrong. Such things are possible.\n \nBut one word on miracle=\r\ns and siddhis. Miracles and siddhis are secondary to self-realization. The =\r\nimportant thing is to do spiritual sadhana, realize self, and live as a lib=\r\nerated person (jeevanmukta) continuing to discharge the job assigned to one=\r\n by Nature, with an equanimous mind and neither attraction nor repulsion to=\r\n anything. Nature assigns different jobs to different persons. Personalitie=\r\ns like Sai Baba, Ramana Maharshi, Raghavendra Swami, Aurobindo, Ramakrishna=\r\n Paramahamsa, Jnaneshwar Maharaj, Trilinga Swami, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Ram=\r\nanujacharya, Madhwacharya, Adi Shankara etc did different jobs on this eart=\r\nh, but what is common between them is that they completely overcame their l=\r\nimited personalities, became realized and then went on to fulfill the tasks=\r\n given to them by the Power that runs the universe, with an equanimous mind=\r\n.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana=\r\n\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish less=\r\nons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Window=\r\ns): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http=\r\n://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------- \n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_03F9_01C9E227.72E5BB30\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3527&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I mentioned my guru Dr Manish Pandit and the \ncom=\r\nmand of the Divine Mother when she appeared before him in March 2006 \nregar=\r\nding teaching simple homam procedures to people.
