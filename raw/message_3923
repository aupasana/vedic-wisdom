It is already going on, even before one starts a formal spiritual sadhana such as homam or japam.\n \nWhen one&#39;s husband or wife says something one does not appreciate and one becomes angry and feels like fighting, it is god testing one (using the husband or wife as the instrument). When one feels greedy for a propery or jealous about the achievements of a friend, it is god testing one (using the property or friend as an instrument).\n \nIrrespective of whether one does sadhana or not and whether one wants to progress spiritually or not, god is continuously testing one.\n \nIf one is studying in 5th grade/class/standard, one&#39;s exams are at that level. When one passes the 5th grade and goes to sixth, one will start getting exams at that level. Similarly, as one&#39;s control over mind improves a little, the tests may be at a slightly different level. But, all of us are tested all the time.\n \nAlso, do not worry about punishment etc. If one fails the test in the 5th grade, one remains there and does not advance to the 6th grade. Of course, one expecting to go to the 6th grade and exicted about it may see as a punishment. But it is not disastrous. One keeps stydying in the 5th grade till one knows it well.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- prm7782 &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Respected Sri Narsimha Sir,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks on explaining all about what shakti is. That was very helpful. \n&gt; \n&gt; There are constant discussions on how god tests his disciples. I am curious to know at what point testing begins. What if a sadhak fails? How severely does he get punished? Finally can god whom we pray so much punish us so badly.\n&gt; \n&gt; There are people who feel the need of guru. I feel like sharing something about my experience with respect to it. I have a small side business and any money I get from it gives me happiness as lot of hard work is involved. When I started the homam it was  doing ok business. After starting homam the business picked up. Oneday I got vulgar thoughts in mind and the business went down immediately. I found out my mistake worked on it. My business picked up again then I started getting greedy for more money. Down went the business again. I worked on controlling my mind towards temptation of money. Business picked up again. After a very long time I had a heavy fight with my husband the other day hurled abuses and now my business is down again. I know this time God wants me to work on anger.\n&gt; How beautifully God is acting guru and taming me? Simply amazing!!\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Priya\n\n\n"}}
