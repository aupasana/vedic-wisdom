It happe=\r\nned in a Western country with nobody knowledgeable in Bharatavarsha traditi=\r\nons nearby. We did everything as per laws and injunctions of that particula=\r\nr country. On my behalf besides praying to Almighty I had put into his grav=\r\ne vibhuti and poured Ganga water which I had since my pilgrimage to Badrina=\r\nth for Shraaddha ceremony during Pitru Paksha this year. Also I burn a cand=\r\nle before my father&#39;s photo every day praying for his happy afterlife (he w=\r\nas a virtuous person). Nevertheless I feel an urge to know more and do more=\r\n as per our Hindu tradition. \n\nI would be extremely grateful for any clarif=\r\nication on the subject. Also if you are knowledgeable of any useful website=\r\ns containing first-hand in-depth information (not superficials or superstit=\r\nions) they are welcomed also. I&#39;m sorry if the subject was already covered =\r\nin previous topics. In this case, please, let me know the message number if=\r\n possible.\n\nWith Love to all,\nManeesha\n\n\n"}}
