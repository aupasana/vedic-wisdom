M=\r\ny specific question is if non-duality is the final stage, who attained it s=\r\no far ? Whosoever attained, how could they be in duality later !\nAll the ga=\r\nnas who are with Lord Shiva, they are present with him; they see him as mah=\r\nAkAla and yet are separate from him ? \n\nAnyways, non-duality is good to rea=\r\nd, just impossible to comprehend. For ex: some of the heinious crimes in th=\r\ne world are part of the negativity and how could any one see it without the=\r\n dual nature as &quot;negative&quot; and just neutral ?\n\nT\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;Dr. A.

But I feel that these tw=\r\no are different and co-existing properties of God.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When we talk ab=\r\nout a coin. we say that this is a coin of such and such denomination. It ha=\r\ns a head and tail. when we go deeper we get to know that coin is all made o=\r\nf nickel. it is insignificant to know whether it has head or tail. importan=\r\nt is that it is all nickel. When we go further deep we realise that there i=\r\ns nothing but protons and electrons and neutrons. And these are the same pr=\r\notons/electrons and neutrons which make whole universe.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When we th=\r\nink as head and tail, at this stage we are just introduced to a deity. We s=\r\nee His form keep faith on His form. When we go deeper we realise that This =\r\ndeity fills whole universe and this whole universe is accomodated by the de=\r\nity. This stage resembles to the stage where we see coin as a piece of nick=\r\nel. When we further go deeper, we realise that the deity is nothing but man=\r\nifestation of that nirvikar brahma. And this Nirvikar brahma is the one who=\r\n fills all the universe and all the deities are manifestation of that Nirvi=\r\nkar brahma alone. At this stage one understand that there is no difference =\r\nbetween these deities.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You can think of different deities as coins=\r\n of different currencies/countries. Coin of any country can be used to buy =\r\nclothes/food etc and all of them are as valuable. all of them are made of d=\r\nifferent alloys/metals. But all of them are made of same protons/electrons =\r\nand neutrons.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; These three different properties are not same contra=\r\ndicting properties. But they are all three different properties. Same coin =\r\nhave head and tail. Same coin is made of nickel and same coin is made of ne=\r\nutrons etc. So these are not confusing but well explaining I think.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Sorry if I confused you further. I usually do so. In short I can say that=\r\n Duality and Non-duality these should not be confused as contradictory. but=\r\n they are two different properties of same god.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sorry for the mist=\r\nakes\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Deep regards\n&gt; &gt; with the grace of Lord krishna\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste T,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is confusing !\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;Which is wh=\r\ny, I understand only duality to follow :-)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; You removed your co=\r\nnfusion by writing last statement :-).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is all duality and only dua=\r\nlity till there is an experience of oneness...even if a small tiny one.
