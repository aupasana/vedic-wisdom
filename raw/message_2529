Of course, that helps. But, it is possible to squander that money and end up with a zero balance later.\n \nSimilarly, one without a rich father may open a bank account with a very small opening balance. But, if one works hard, one may end up very rich.\n \nYour question is akin to asking whether a person who does not have a rich father can open a bank account. Of course, he can. He should open an account and work really hard to grow it.\n \nSecondly, there are very very few people who have a good amount of shakti with any mantra and the capability to transfer some of it to someone else.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- gigarm2003 &lt;gigarm2003@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Respected members.\n&gt; I have heard that a Mantra to be effective has to be assigned by a Guru, because\n&gt; he can send His Shakti to the devotee.\n&gt; But sometimes for some people is not possible to meet a Guru personally for many\n&gt; reasons (distance karma etc)\n&gt; Can someone pick a mantra, chanting it with bhakti and have some benefit, even\n&gt; without a Guru guidance ?\n&gt; I would appreciate your opinion about my question.\n&gt; Thank you\n&gt; Armando\n&gt; \n&gt; Italy\n\n\n"}}
