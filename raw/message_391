Suppose one is digging with a spade to find \nwater. Spade is a tool and represents a mantra or a maalaa or an idol etc. \nDigging represents sadhana and search for god. Finding water is finding god. \nA guru is one who helps one in the process of digging and enables one to \nfind water. If one is using a bad spade, he may give a good spade. If one is \ndigging inefficiently, he may teach a better and smarter way to dig. If one \nis digging in a wrong place, he may show where to dig (which god to worship) \nfor faster results. So, a guru should simply help one in finding god. \nExactly what help is needed depends on the situation. It is neither \nnecessary nor sufficient to give a mantra.\n\nSome gurus give mantras or other objects such as idols or maalas etc and \ntransfer some of their sadhana through that medium. In my experience that I \nmentioned, my guru sent me a rudraksha maalaa he specially made for me and \nhe tranferred some of his sadhana and acquired purity to me through that \nmedium and that made some things possible for me.\n\nWhen Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) went to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, he \ntouched Narendranath&#39;s chest with his foot and Narendranath went into \nsamadhi. Ramana Maharshi just glanced at Ganapathi Muni silently and all of \nlatter&#39;s questions were answered. There are different gurus, different \nsishyas, different karmas, different rinas and different relationships.\n\n&gt; Or is it that since it is from a book, I cannot call him as my Guru and I\n&gt; dont have a guru yet? Should I think that a guru is yet to come for me?\n\n:-) Two things. Books and emails such as this one are not just words. They \nconsist of words at the gross level and thoughts at a subtler level. \nDepending on the energy (purity) level of the person composing those books \nor emails, some energy is placed in the words and the thoughts behind them. \nDepending on your own capacity to receive and your own rinas with the \nauthor, you may grasp some of that energy, get the right thoughts from the \nwords and benefit from them. The words themselves are just useless. It is \nthe thoughts and energy behind them that may actually benefit someone and \nhelp in internal purification.\n\nSecondly, one can have many gurus, though one ideally wants one guru who \ntakes care of it all. Dattatreya had many gurus.\n\n&gt; Is it necessary that a Guru should be alive and should directly speak\n&gt; to us and give a mantra to consider him as out Guru?\n\nLet me deviate a bit. I was once meditating in the garbhalaya of a temple, \nsitting directly in front of a yogi. We were both meditating on Savitri \nGayatri mantra. After half hour or so, I lost normal awareness of my body \nand I felt like I was some all-pervading orange light. I saw that there was \na person at the center of that light, who was emiting that light. When I \nlooked closer, it was that yogi (who was sitting in front of me and \nmeditating). After a little time, he suddenly changed into another person \nthat I could recognize. This was a very famous spiritual giant from the past \nand he was not alive then. I wondered &quot;why did X change into Y&quot;. That \ndisturbed my focus and my regular self-awareness returned and I became aware \nthat I was Narasimha meditating in that garbhalaya and X was sitting in \nfront of me. I opened my eyes. At the same time, that yogi also opened his \neyes. Without my saying anything, he asked &quot;you saw me, no?&quot; I was surprised \nthat he knew it. However, what baffled me the most was why he transformed \ninto Y. I stuttered, &quot;but...&quot;. Without my finishing it, he remarked, &quot;you \nsee Narasimha, the blessings of my guru of last life are still with me. That \nis why you saw him in me!&quot; He not only knew what I saw, but explained it \nsuccintly. This yogi attributes a lot of progress he made in this life to \nhis past life guru (in addition to current life guru of course). His \ngratitude to his past life guru is immense. Existence of such people \nconvinces me fully that when a spiritual giant comes and goes, his thoughts \nand his energy linger on earth for a long time and those who are \nsufficiently pure and receptive can actually receive from them. The body in \nwhich the soul lived may decay, but Maharshi Vasishtha teaches that thoughts \nof the person never die and stay in space for ever and may guide many.\n\nBottomline: You can consider anybody as your guru. If you are lucky, that \nperson will also consider you as a sishya and have a more active \nrelationship. A more active guru may even take some really blocking karmas \nfrom a disciple to speed up purification and progress. Thus, it is \nbeneficial to have such a guru. But, when you are talking about a spiritual \ngiant, even a passive (from his/her side) relationship is immensely \nbeneficial.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nRespected Sir,\n\nThis mail was really worth reading.\nBut I have a few doubts. Is the criteria for accepting somebody as\nour Guru that the person must give us a mantra/or ask us to chant\nsome specific mantra?\nWhat if we are already chanting some mantra?\nI have been chanting Shiv mantra since my childhood, as I had a some\nkind of affinity towards Shiv and Shiv mantra(like in dreams I would\nsee myself chanting shive mantra, or when I get up in the morning the\nmantra would come to my mind automatically, even if I was not\nthinking about it). But I never practised chanting the mantra till I\nI read about meditation and mantra from a book written by Swami\nChinmayananda(when I was in 8th or 9th std). Since then I thought of\nSwami Chinmayananda as my spritual Guru. More than that I grew up\nreading Swamiji&#39;s books and listening to his Geeta classes whenever\nhe came to my native place. So is it right to consider him as my Guru\nbecause I got the mantra from his book and started chanting after\nreading the book? Or is it that since it is from a book, I cannot\ncall him as my Guru and I dont have a guru yet? Should I think that a\nguru is yet to come for me?\nIs it necessary that a Guru should be alive and should directly speak\nto us and give a mantra to consider him as out Guru? I know, I am\nputting the same question in different ways, but still, these are my\ndoubts.\n\nPlease let me know your comments on this.\n\nWith respects,\n&lt;deleted&gt;\n\n\n"}}
