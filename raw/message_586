In the mi=\r\nddle of the homa, during the\nhoma if the fire goes out, like there is no bo=\r\ndy of the fire in the\nkunda then but only the red embers, which sometimes i=\r\nnspite of\ndropping ghee does not light up again but goes only creating heav=\r\ny\nsmoke. What should one do in such a situation. Light the fire again\nfrom =\r\nthe lamp? Or leave the homa incomplete.\n&gt; Also is this some kind of an inau=\r\nspicious sign? \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This above=\r\n all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - Hamlet\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sun, 2/11/08, Narasi=\r\nmha P.V.R.

It is thrown away. If you live in =\r\nwoods, throw\nit away \n&gt; in the open so animals can eat it. Otheriwse, throw=\r\n it in garbage.\n&gt; \n&gt; On the other hand, &quot;naivedyam&quot; offered to god can be c=\r\nonsumed by\npeople as \n&gt; prasad.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) Either is fine. They symbolize the=\r\n path of shakti moving from\nyou to the \n&gt; fire and vice versa.\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) Eit=\r\nher is fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) Whether it is our bodies or flowers/akshatas used in =\r\na pooja,\neverything \n&gt; has a purpose and it has to go when its purpose is s=\r\nerved. That&#39;s\nthe nature \n&gt; of life. While the flowers and akshatas are use=\r\nd in homam, they are \n&gt; sacrosanct and should be handled with care, love an=\r\nd respect. After\nthey \n&gt; serve their purpose, they have to be disposed of h=\r\nowever one can.\nThrowing \n&gt; in garbage is fine if you ask me. Another way i=\r\ns to collect them in\na bag \n&gt; until you accumulate a good amount and burn t=\r\nhem oneday. If you have\na local \n&gt; temple, you can go and see if you can th=\r\nrow them wherever they throw\nthe \n&gt; flowers etc they use at the temple.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; The ashes from the homam are considered sacred. They contain *some*\nof th=\r\ne \n&gt; energy generated from the homam. The best way to dispose the ashes\nis =\r\nto \n&gt; throw them into a flowing stream of water (a river or an ocean). This=\r\n \n&gt; ensures that the energy is not localized to one place and is\ndistribute=\r\nd \n&gt; back to the Nature. Another thing some people do is to dig a deep\npit =\r\nin the \n&gt; yard and bury the ashes. It restricts the energy to the place and=\r\n not a \n&gt; great idea. Please remember that the energy in the ashes is only =\r\na\n*part* of \n&gt; the energy generated. Some energy is also within the person\n=\r\nperforming homam \n&gt; and helps to purify the person. Giving some part back t=\r\no the nature\nis a \n&gt; very good idea.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Ho=\r\nmam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yo=\r\nurself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://gro=\r\nups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ve=\r\ndicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.V=\r\nedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJag=\r\nan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- - \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_patha=\r\nk@ yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Saturday, Nove=\r\nmber 01, 2008 7:18 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] questions w.r.t.

If o=\r\nne takes\n&gt; &gt; a Dray coconut Half and presses it by holding in both Palms, i=\r\nt&#39;ll\n&gt; &gt; break in to 3 to 4 pieces. if required, one can further make one o=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; two pieces from those again by breaking it by using palms. I&#39;ve\n&gt; &gt; e=\r\nxperinced that those pieces works out to be very useful (Size wise)\n&gt; &gt; to =\r\nsustain fire for long time hence one can concentrate more in\n&gt; &gt; reciting M=\r\nantra then worrying about sustainance of fire. the another\n&gt; &gt; important ad=\r\nvantage is that use of Knife can be completely avoided.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; just one in=\r\nput if it helps some..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt; &gt; utpal\n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Add more friends to your messenger and=\r\n enjoy!
