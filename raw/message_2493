Therefore the waking state is\nuni=\r\nversally taken to be real. But this is wrong. For do you not experience\nthe=\r\n same extent of permanency and purposefulness in dreams as in the wakeful\ns=\r\ntate?\n\nWakeful consciousness does not intervene in dreams nor does\ndream-co=\r\nnsciousness intervene in the wakeful state, while the two factors =97\nendur=\r\ning nature and purposefulness =97 are common to both.\n\nExamine your past dr=\r\neams and past waking experiences in the light of these\nfacts and see for yo=\r\nurself.\n\nAgain, note the appearance of reality in magical phenomena and the=\r\n seemingly\npurposeful actions of magical creations. Does reality rest on th=\r\ne slender\nbasis of such appearances?\n\nThe confusion is due to want of discr=\r\nimination between the real and the\nunreal among ignorant folk. Ignorantly i=\r\nndeed do they say that the wakeful\nuniverse is real.\n\nThe existence of Real=\r\nity is self-evident and does not require other aids to\nreveal it. Unreality=\r\n is the contrary.\n\nIf you say, however, that a thing is real until and unle=\r\nss its existence is\ncontradicted, consider the example of a coil of rope be=\r\ning mistaken for a\nsnake. The fancied snake would according to you be real =\r\nin the interval\nantecedent to correct knowledge, but that is absurd.\n\nThe m=\r\nost important of the qualifications is the desire for emancipation.\nNothing=\r\n can be achieved without it. Study of philosophy and discussion on\nthe subj=\r\nect with others are thoroughly useless, being no better than the\nstudy of a=\r\nrts. For the matter of that, one might as well hope for salvation\nby a stud=\r\ny of sculpture and the practice of that art. The study of\nphilosophy in the=\r\n absence of a longing for salvation, is like dressing up a\ncorpse.\n\nThe fru=\r\nit of Self-realisation is the end of all misery here and hereafter\nand abso=\r\nlute fearlessness. That is called Emancipation.\n\n\n[Note: There is an end of=\r\n misery in sleep; but the potentiality of misery is\nnot ended. Realisation =\r\ndestroys the cause of misery and sets the man free\nforever.]\n\nWhat is perce=\r\nived in the world as being apart from the Self is also clearly\nseen to be p=\r\nerishable. What is perishable must certainly involve fear of\nloss.\n\nWhat is=\r\n the use of hundreds of efforts in the absence of a real and\nunswerving des=\r\nire for emancipation? That is the sole requisite and nothing\nelse.\n\nThe int=\r\nellect is ordinarily befouled by evil propensities and so nothing\ngood flou=\r\nrishes there. Consequently,people are boiled in the seething\ncauldron of bi=\r\nrths and deaths. Of these evil propensities, the first is want\nof faith in =\r\nthe revelations made by the Guru and in the sastras; the second\nis addictio=\r\nn to desires; and the third is dullness (i.e., inability to\nunderstand the =\r\nrevealed truth). This is a brief statement of them.\n\nOf these, want of fait=\r\nh is betrayed by one=92s doubts regarding the truth of\nthe statements and b=\r\ny failure to understand them. The doubt arises whether\nthere is moksha; and=\r\n later misunderstanding leads to its denial. These two\nare sure obstacles t=\r\no any sincere efforts being made for realisation.\n\nThe second propensity, n=\r\namely desire,prevents the intellect from following\nthe right pursuit.For th=\r\ne mind engrossed in desire cannot engage in a\nspiritual pursuit. The abstra=\r\nction of a lover is well known to all; he can\nhear or see nothing in front =\r\nof him. Anything said in his hearing is as good\nas not said. Desire must th=\r\nerefore be first overcome before aspiring for\nspiritual attainment. That ca=\r\nn be done only by dispassion. This propensity\nis manifold, being in the for=\r\nms of love, anger,greed, pride, jealousy, etc. The\nworst of them is pursuit=\r\n of pleasure which, if destroyed, destroys all else.\nPleasure may be subtle=\r\n or gross. Neither of these must be indulged in, even\nin thought. As soon a=\r\ns the thought of pleasure arises, it must be dismissed\nby the willpower dev=\r\neloped by dispassion.\n\nThere is no accomplishment equal to Self-realisation=\r\n,which is alone capable\nof ending all misery, because it is the state of et=\r\nernal Bliss.\n\nHe who is, from his own experience, capable of appreciating t=\r\nhe states of\nother Jnanis, including the best among them, is certainly a pe=\r\nrfect Sage. He\nwho is not influenced by happiness or misery, by pleasure or=\r\n pain,by\ndesires, doubts or fear, is a perfect Sage. He who realises pleasu=\r\nre, pain\nand every other phenomenon to be in and of the Self, is a perfect =\r\nSage. He\nwho feels himself pervading all =97 be they ignorant or emancipate=\r\nd =97 is a\nperfect Sage. He who, knowing the trammels of bondage, does not =\r\nseek release\nfrom them and remains in peace, is a perfect Sage.\n\nAn intense=\r\n devotee, though endowed with only a little discipline of other\nkinds (e.g.=\r\n, dispassion), can readily understand the truth though only\ntheoretically, =\r\nand expound it to others. Such exposition helps him to imbue\nthose ideas an=\r\nd so he absorbs the truth. This ultimately leads him to\nidentify all indivi=\r\nduals with Siva and he is no longer affected by pleasure\nor pain. All-round=\r\n identification with Siva makes him the best of Jnanis and\na Jivanmukta (em=\r\nancipated here and now). Therefore bhakti yoga (the way of\ndevotion) is the=\r\n best of all and excels all else.\n\nInvestigation cuts at the root of ignora=\r\nnce.Dispassion develops\ninvestigation. Disgust for the pleasures of life ge=\r\nnerates dispassion\ntowards them.\n\nInvestigation is analysis conducted withi=\r\nn oneself, discriminating the\nnon-self from the Self, stimulated by a stern=\r\n, strong and sincere desire to\nrealise the Self. Dispassion is non-attachme=\r\nnt to surroundings. This results\nif the misery consequent on attachment is =\r\nkept in mind.\n\nFear holds a man possessed of enormous wealth; misery, of a =\r\nlarge family;\nand poverty, of insatiable desires.\n\nThe man with no attachme=\r\nnts is free from fear; the one with controlled mind\nis free from misery;the=\r\n Self-realised man is never needy.\n\n\nJust as an actor is not really affecte=\r\nd by the passions which he displays on\nthe stage, so also this Jnani, alway=\r\ns aware of his perfection, is not\naffected by the seeming pleasures and pai=\r\nns which he regards as a mere\nillusion, like the horns of a hare.\n\nThe high=\r\nest Jnani makes no difference between samadhi and worldly\ntransactions. He =\r\nnever finds anything apart from the Self and so there is no\nlapse for him.\n=\r\n\nThe state of the Jnani is said to be identical with that of Siva. There is=\r\n\nnot the least difference between them. Therefore karma cannot besmear a\nJn=\r\nani.\n\nSource: TRIPURA RAHASYA OR THE MYSTERY BEYOND THE TRINITY Translated =\r\nby\nSWAMI SRI RAMANANANDA SARASWATHI (Munagala S.
