Fierce deities like=\r\n Chandi can indeed cause some disturbances \n&gt; in material life. Though it i=\r\ns for good in the long run, it can be \n&gt; uncomfortable until things settle =\r\ndown. If you stick to Mahaganapathi, \n&gt; things will be more controlled, mea=\r\nsured and balanced. The high voltage \n&gt; of Chandi may or may not be digesti=\r\nble to all.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, interestingly, a lot of good people who used to b=\r\ne laymen in \n&gt; spiritual matters 5 years back are doing regular Chandi homa=\r\nm now. This \n&gt; is honestly quite amazing and should have an impact on dharm=\r\na in the \n&gt; world.\n&gt; \n&gt; Stick to Mahaganapathi homam for a few months atlea=\r\nst, before \n&gt; considering something else.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do not ask for specific resu=\r\nlts and let god decide the best for you. Do \n&gt; homam with a sense of surren=\r\nder, devotion and sacredness.\n&gt; \n&gt; All the best!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Naras=\r\nimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n=\r\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do I=\r\nt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;            =\r\n        http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference=\r\n: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyot=\r\nishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; ---------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Jun 29=\r\n, 2011 at 10:51 PM, AM2178 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste, Please tell me how can I co=\r\nnvince my parents that doing homam \n&gt; is safe for me?
