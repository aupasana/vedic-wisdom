The frightened devotees beat upon their plates and drums to drive=\r\n\n&gt; her\n&gt; &gt; away. But she quenched her thirst unconcerned and then went on h=\r\ner way\n&gt; with\n&gt; &gt; a roar. Ramana said astonished,=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93Why d=\r\no you worry so much? The leopard\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; intimated to me by the first roar th=\r\nat she was coming here. After\n&gt; drinking\n&gt; &gt; water she told me by another r=\r\noar that she was going. She went her own\n&gt; way.She\n&gt; &gt; never meddled with y=\r\nour affairs. Why are you so scared? This mountain is\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; home of thes=\r\ne wild animals, and we are their guests. That being so, is it\n&gt; &gt; right on =\r\nyour part to drive them away?=C3=A2=E2=82=AC\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ramana was equally fea=\r\nrless with regard to scorpions. Vasudeva Sastri\n&gt; &gt; recounts, =C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC=C5=93One day, when we were at Skandashram, I was aghast to find a\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\ncorpion climbing up over Bhagavan=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s body in the fron=\r\nt and another at\n&gt; the\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; same time climbing down his back. I was terrif=\r\nied and wanted to do\n&gt; &gt; something. But Bhagavan remained calm, as if nothi=\r\nng happened, and the\n&gt; two\n&gt; &gt; scorpions, after crawling over his body as i=\r\nf over a wall, eventually\n&gt; left\n&gt; &gt; him. After they left,Bhagavan explaine=\r\nd to us, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9CThey crawl over you\n&gt; just as\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; they woul=\r\nd crawl on the floor or a wall or tree. Do they crawl over\n&gt; &gt; these,stingi=\r\nng as they go? It is only because you fear them and do\n&gt; &gt; something,that t=\r\nhey fear you and do something in return=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2.=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, in so far as concerns insects which were a nuisance=\r\n to people,\n&gt; Sri\n&gt; &gt; Ramana did not object to killing them. When once a wh=\r\nole army of black\n&gt; ants\n&gt; &gt; invaded the Hall through the water drain,he to=\r\nld Annamalai Swami to\n&gt; detect\n&gt; &gt; where they were coming from and to put a=\r\nn end to it. The hole was\n&gt; cemented\n&gt; &gt; over without further ado. He also =\r\nused to pluck blood-sucking insects out\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; the coats of the dogs and =\r\nthrow them into the gleaming coals. Similarly\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; did not object if de=\r\nvotees killed mosquitoes or used insecticide in the\n&gt; &gt; cowshed.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ma=\r\nharshi had the same compassionate attitude towards plants as towards\n&gt; &gt; an=\r\nimals. One day workers had been deputed to gather mangoes from one of\n&gt; the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; trees. But instead of climbing up the tree and picking them one by one=\r\n,\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; knocked them down with\n&gt; &gt; sticks. In this way a large number =\r\nof leaves were knocked down along with\n&gt; &gt; the fruit. Ramana, who was as us=\r\nual sitting in the Hall,heard the beating\n&gt; &gt; and sent a message via his at=\r\ntendants that it should stop at once. When\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; later passed by the tre=\r\ne and saw the mango leaves in heaps on the floor,\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; cried out harshl=\r\ny, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93In return for giving us fruit, is the tree to be\n&gt; =\r\nbeaten\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; with sticks? Who gave you this work? Instead of beating the tr=\r\nee, you\n&gt; might\n&gt; &gt; as well cut it to the roots. You need not gather the fr=\r\nuit. Go away!=C3=A2=E2=82=AC\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When one of the attendants beat the mo=\r\nnkeys, because they had stolen\n&gt; nuts,\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan rebuked him, =C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=C5=93You are not beating the monkeys, you are beating\n&gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; The =\r\npain is mine.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The monkeys often stole the fruit whic=\r\nh devotees had brought as a food\n&gt; &gt; offering, if the latter were not caref=\r\nul or were meditating.One of the\n&gt; &gt; attendants was entrusted with the task=\r\n of receiving the fruit from the\n&gt; &gt; visitors. One day he was sitting with =\r\neyes closed, a basket full of fruit\n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt; his side, listening to the rad=\r\nio. In the mean\n&gt; &gt; time the monkeys were freely helping themselves to the =\r\ncontents of the\n&gt; &gt; basket. When people in the Hall tried to chase the monk=\r\neys away, Ramana\n&gt; &gt; joked, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93When these attendants are =\r\nimmersed in deep meditation, the\n&gt; monkeys\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; come and see to the work o=\r\nf the attendants. Someone has to look after the\n&gt; &gt; work! The attendants pu=\r\nt the fruit into the basket, the monkeys put the\n&gt; &gt; fruit into their stoma=\r\nchs; that is all the difference. While people\n&gt; forget\n&gt; &gt; themselves while=\r\n listening to the music over the radio the monkeys busy\n&gt; &gt; themselves in e=\r\nnjoying the sweet juice of the fruit. That is good,\n&gt; isn=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=\r\n=84=A2t\n&gt; &gt; it!=C3=A2=E2=82=AC\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The monkey mothers liked to come wit=\r\nh their babies, to show them to\n&gt; Ramana\n&gt; &gt; full of pride. Suri Nagamma re=\r\nports, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93Yesterday a monkey with her baby\n&gt; stood\n&gt; &gt; in=\r\n the window by the side of Bhagavan=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s sofa. Bhagavan=\r\n was reading\n&gt; something\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and so did not notice\n&gt; &gt; it. After a while,=\r\n the monkey screeched and one of the attendants tried\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; drive her aw=\r\nay by shouting, but she would not go.Bhagavan then looked up\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; said=\r\n, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9CWait! She has come here to show her baby to Bhagavan=\r\n; do not all\n&gt; the\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; people bring their children to show them? For her,=\r\n her child is equally\n&gt; &gt; dear. Look how young that child is.=C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC=E2=84=A2 So saying, Bhagavan turned towards\n&gt; her,\n&gt; &gt; and said in an e=\r\nndearing tone, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9CHullo! So you have brought your child?\n=\r\n&gt; That\n&gt; &gt; is good!=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2 And, giving her a plantain, he =\r\nsent her away.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sri Ramana felt a deep admiration for=\r\n the monkey tribes and was convinced\n&gt; &gt; that tapas was not unknown to them=\r\n. Once he said, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93I have known\n&gt; something\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; about t=\r\nheir organisation, their kings, laws,regulations. Everything is so\n&gt; &gt; perf=\r\nect and well-organised. So much intelligence behind it all. I even\n&gt; know\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; that tapas is not unknown to monkeys. A monkey whom we used to call\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9CMottaipaiyan=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2 was once oppresse=\r\nd and ill-treated by a gang. He went\n&gt; away\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; into the forest for a few=\r\n days, did tapas, acquired strength and\n&gt; returned.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When he came an=\r\nd sat on a bough and shook it, all the rest of the\n&gt; monkeys,\n&gt; &gt; who had p=\r\nreviously ill-treated him and of whom he was previously mortally\n&gt; &gt; afraid=\r\n, were now quaking before him. Yes, I am clear that tapas is well\n&gt; &gt; known=\r\n to monkeys.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One day when Ramana inadvertently bumpe=\r\nd against a sparrow=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s nest, an\n&gt; egg\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; fell out =\r\nand cracked. He was dismayed and cried out to his attendant\n&gt; &gt; Madhava, =\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93Look, look what I have done today! Oh,the poor mother =\r\nwill be\n&gt; so\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sorrow-stricken, perhaps angry with me also, at my causi=\r\nng the\n&gt; destruction\n&gt; &gt; of her expected little one! Can the cracked eggshe=\r\nll be pieced together\n&gt; &gt; again? Let us try!=C3=A2=E2=82=AC\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; So sayi=\r\nng he took a piece of wet cloth, wrapped it around the broken egg\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n laid it back into its nest. Each third hour he took it out again, removed\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; the cloth, took it in his hand and glanced at it for a few minutes. Sev=\r\nen\n&gt; &gt; days later, after taking the egg from its nest, he announced with th=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; astonishment of a schoolboy, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93Look what a\n&gt; &gt; won=\r\nder! The crack has closed.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC Some days later he found the egg =\r\nhatched\n&gt; out,\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the little bird had come out. With a face beaming with=\r\n joy he took the\n&gt; &gt; nestling into his hand, stroked and caressed it and ha=\r\nnded it to the\n&gt; others,\n&gt; &gt; that they could also admire it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One da=\r\ny some new born squirrels had fallen out of their nest and landed\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nRamana=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s couch. Their eyes were still closed and the=\r\ny were very tiny.\n&gt; The\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; mother, however, did not take them back. But =\r\nhow should one feed such\n&gt; tiny\n&gt; &gt; things? The squirrels laid in Ramana=C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s palm. His face was glowing with\n&gt; love\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; and aff=\r\nection towards them. The devotees looked on helplessly, but he was\n&gt; &gt; happ=\r\ny and cheerful. He asked for some cotton and made a soft bed for\n&gt; &gt; them.T=\r\nhen he took a piece of the cotton, rolled it up so that the end\n&gt; looked\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; like a sharp needle, dipped it into some milk and trickled it in their\n&gt; =\r\ntiny\n&gt; &gt; mouths. This he did repeatedly. He looked after them with great ca=\r\nre and\n&gt; &gt; love until they grew up and started running around. They did not=\r\n run\n&gt; away,\n&gt; &gt; however, but always ran around their =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9C=\r\nmother=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Something similar happened, when =\r\na cat ate the mother of some young\n&gt; &gt; squirrels. Again Ramana took on the =\r\ntask of caring for the young. As he\n&gt; &gt; liked to use daily events to teach =\r\nhis devotees he said to them, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93These\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; little ones =\r\ndo not know that wisdom lies in remaining in their nest. They\n&gt; &gt; keep atte=\r\nmpting to come out. All trouble lies outside but they cannot\n&gt; remain\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nithin. Similarly if the mind is not externalised, but remains sunk in\n&gt; the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Heart then there would only be happiness. But the mind keeps moving\n&gt; =\r\nout.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC\n&gt; &gt; When Rangaswami asked, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93What is=\r\n the path for keeping it inward?=C3=A2=E2=82=AC ,\n&gt; Bhagavan\n&gt; &gt; said, =C3=\r\n=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93It is exactly the same as what I am doing now. Each time =\r\na young\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; squirrel comes out, I keep putting it back into its nest. Whe=\r\nn I go on\n&gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; it, it learns the happiness of staying in the nest.=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shantamma reports, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93Once Lakshm=\r\ni came into the Hall. She was pregnant\n&gt; at\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; that time. It was after l=\r\nunch time, when Bhagavan was reading the\n&gt; &gt; newspapers. Lakshmi came near =\r\nand started licking the papers. Bhagavan\n&gt; &gt; looked up and said: =C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=CB=9CWait a little, Lakshmi.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2 But Lakshmi wen=\r\nt on\n&gt; licking.\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan laid his paper aside, put his hands behind Lak=\r\nshmi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s horns and\n&gt; his\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; head against hers. Like=\r\n this they stayed for quite a long time. I stood\n&gt; &gt; nearby looking at the =\r\nwonderful scene. After some ten minutes or so,\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan turned to me an=\r\nd said: =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9CDo you know what Lakshmi is doing? She\n&gt; is\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; samadhi.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2 I looked at her and tears were fl=\r\nowing in streams down her\n&gt; broad\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; cheeks. Her breathing had stopped a=\r\nnd her eyes were fixed on Bhagavan.\n&gt; After\n&gt; &gt; some time Bhagavan changed =\r\nhis position and asked: =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9CLakshmi, how do you\n&gt; feel\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n now?=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2 Lakshmi moved backwards, as if reluctant to t=\r\nurn her tail towards\n&gt; &gt; Bhagavan,walked round the Hall and went out.=C3=A2=\r\n=E2=82=AC\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Several dogs lived in the Ashram. The most famous was Jac=\r\nkie,who was\n&gt; later\n&gt; &gt; buried in the Ashram compound alongside the deer Va=\r\nlli and a crow. He did\n&gt; &gt; not much like playing and did not join the other=\r\n dogs, but would sit in\n&gt; &gt; front of Sri Ramana, fixing his gaze on his eye=\r\ns incessantly. He would\n&gt; also\n&gt; &gt; not start eating until Ramana had taken =\r\na mouthful of food. One day when\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; stray dog entered the Ashram throu=\r\ngh the back door, Jackie started\n&gt; barking.\n&gt; &gt; Ramana calmed him saying, =\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93You just close your eyes. You just close\n&gt; your\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\neyes. You just close your eyes. If you do this you will not be able to\n&gt; se=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; the dog.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC At once Jackie closed his eyes.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One=\r\n day Jackie was attacked by a ferocious pig and was seriously injured.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHis stomach was torn open and the intestines came out. It required a lot\n&gt; =\r\nof\n&gt; &gt; stitches to close it up and afterwards Jackie was carried to a manta=\r\npam\n&gt; &gt; opposite the Ashram to recover. At the same time Kunju Swami was\n&gt; =\r\nsuffering\n&gt; &gt; from a severe abscess on his foot and was also staying in the=\r\n same\n&gt; mantapam.\n&gt; &gt; When Sri Ramana came to visit them, Kunju Swami was c=\r\nrying out in pain\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; fell at Maharshi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s feet.=\r\n But Ramana said to him, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93See, how Jackie is\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sile=\r\nntly bearing his pain after such a major operation, without so much\n&gt; as a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; whimper!=C3=A2=E2=82=AC This was helpful to Kunju Swami and his pain be=\r\ncame bearable\n&gt; for\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; him.

Bu=\r\nt she quenched her thirst unconcerned and then went on her way with&lt;br&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&gt; a roar. Ramana said astonished,=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93Why do you worr=\r\ny so much? The leopard&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; intimated to me by the fi=\r\nrst roar that she was coming here.

This mountain is the&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; home of these wild animals, and we are their guests. That being so,=\r\n is it&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; right on your part to drive them away?=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Ramana was equally fearless with reg=\r\nard to scorpions. Vasudeva Sastri&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; recounts, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=\r\n=C5=93One day, when we were at Skandashram, I was aghast to find a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n scorpion climbing up over Bhagavan=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s body in the fr=\r\nont and another at the&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; same time climbing down h=\r\nis back. I was terrified and wanted to do&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; something. But Bhagavan =\r\nremained calm, as if nothing happened, and the two&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; scorpions, afte=\r\nr crawling over his body as if over a wall, eventually left&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nhim. After they left,Bhagavan explained to us, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9CThey cr=\r\nawl over you just as&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; they would crawl on the flo=\r\nor or a wall or tree. Do they crawl over&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; these,stinging as they go=\r\n? It is only because you fear them and do&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; something,that the=\r\ny fear you and do something in return=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2.=C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC &lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; However, in so far as concerns in=\r\nsects which were a nuisance to people, Sri&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Ramana did not object t=\r\no killing them. When once a whole army of black ants&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; invaded the H=\r\nall through the water drain,he told Annamalai Swami to detect&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; wher=\r\ne they were coming from and to put an end to it. The hole was cemented&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; over without further ado. He also used to pluck blood-sucking insects =\r\nout of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the coats of the dogs and throw them into the gleaming coal=\r\ns. Similarly he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; did not object if devotees killed mosquitoes or us=\r\ned insecticide in the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; cowshed.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Maharshi had the=\r\n same compassionate attitude towards plants as towards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; animals. On=\r\ne day workers had been deputed to gather mangoes from one of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; t=\r\nrees. But instead of climbing up the tree and picking them one by one, they=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; knocked them down with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sticks. In this way a large numbe=\r\nr of leaves were knocked down along with&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the fruit. Ramana, who wa=\r\ns as usual sitting in the Hall,heard the beating&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and sent a messag=\r\ne via his attendants that it should stop at once. When he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; later pa=\r\nssed by the tree and saw the mango leaves in heaps on the floor, he&lt;br&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&gt; cried out harshly, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93In return for giving us fru=\r\nit, is the tree to be beaten&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; with sticks? Who ga=\r\nve you this work? Instead of beating the tree, you might&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; as =\r\nwell cut it to the roots. You need not gather the fruit. Go away!=C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC &lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; When one of the attendants bea=\r\nt the monkeys, because they had stolen nuts,&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; Bhagavan rebuke=\r\nd him, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93You are not beating the monkeys, you are beatin=\r\ng me.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The pain is mine.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC &lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The monkeys often stole the fruit which devotees had brought as =\r\na food&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; offering, if the latter were not careful or were meditating=\r\n.One of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; attendants was entrusted with the task of receiving th=\r\ne fruit from the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; visitors. One day he was sitting with eyes closed=\r\n, a basket full of fruit at&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; his side, listening to the radio. In t=\r\nhe mean&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; time the monkeys were freely helping themselves to the con=\r\ntents of the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; basket. When people in the Hall tried to chase the mo=\r\nnkeys away, Ramana&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; joked, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93When these at=\r\ntendants are immersed in deep meditation, the monkeys&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; come and see to the work of the attendants. Someone has to look after=\r\n the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; work! The attendants put the fruit into the basket, the monke=\r\nys put the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; fruit into their stomachs; that is all the difference. =\r\nWhile people forget&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; themselves while listening to the music over t=\r\nhe radio the monkeys busy&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; themselves in enjoying the sweet j=\r\nuice of the fruit. That is good, isn=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; it!=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC &lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The monkey mothers li=\r\nked to come with their babies, to show them to Ramana&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; full o=\r\nf pride. Suri Nagamma reports, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93Yesterday a monkey with=\r\n her baby stood&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in the window by the side of Bhagavan=C3=A2=E2=82=\r\n=AC=E2=84=A2s sofa. Bhagavan was reading something&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; and so did not notice&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; it. After a while, the monkey screeched a=\r\nnd one of the attendants tried to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; drive her away by shouting, but =\r\nshe would not go.Bhagavan then looked up and&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; said, =C3=A2=E2=\r\n=82=AC=CB=9CWait! She has come here to show her baby to Bhagavan; do not al=\r\nl the&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; people bring their children to show them? =\r\nFor her, her child is equally&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; dear. Look how young that chil=\r\nd is.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2 So saying, Bhagavan turned towards her,&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; and said in an endearing tone, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9CHullo! So you have =\r\nbrought your child? That&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is good!=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2 And, giv=\r\ning her a plantain, he sent her away.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC &lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sri Ramana felt a deep admiration for the monkey tribes and=\r\n was convinced&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; that tapas was not unknown to them. Once he s=\r\naid, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93I have known something&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n about their organisation, their kings, laws,regulations. Everything is so&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; perfect and well-organised. So much intelligence behind it all. I =\r\neven know&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that tapas is not unknown to monkeys. A monkey whom we u=\r\nsed to call&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9CMottaipaiyan=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=\r\n=E2=84=A2 was once oppressed and ill-treated by a gang. He went away&lt;div cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; into the forest for a few days, did tapas, acquired st=\r\nrength and returned.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; When he came and sat on a bough and=\r\n shook it, all the rest of the monkeys,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; who had previously ill-tre=\r\nated him and of whom he was previously mortally&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; afraid, were now q=\r\nuaking before him. Yes, I am clear that tapas is well&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; known =\r\nto monkeys.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One day when Ramana inadvert=\r\nently bumped against a sparrow=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s nest, an egg&lt;div cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; fell out and cracked. He was dismayed and cried out to=\r\n his attendant&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; Madhava, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93Look, look what=\r\n I have done today! Oh,the poor mother will be so&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; sorrow-stricken, perhaps angry with me also, at my causing the destructio=\r\nn&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of her expected little one! Can the cracked eggshell be pieced t=\r\nogether&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; again? Let us try!=C3=A2=E2=82=AC &lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;=\r\nim&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; So saying he took a piece of wet cloth, wrapped it arou=\r\nnd the broken egg and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; laid it back into its nest. Each third hour =\r\nhe took it out again, removed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the cloth, took it in his hand and g=\r\nlanced at it for a few minutes. Seven&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; days later, after taking the=\r\n egg from its nest, he announced with the&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; astonishment of a =\r\nschoolboy, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93Look what a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; wonder! The crack has =\r\nclosed.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC  Some days later he found the egg hatched out,&lt;div c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the little bird had come out. With a face beaming wit=\r\nh joy he took the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; nestling into his hand, stroked and caressed it =\r\nand handed it to the others,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that they could also admire it.&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One day some new born squirrels had fallen out of their nest =\r\nand landed on&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; Ramana=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s couch. Their e=\r\nyes were still closed and they were very tiny. The&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; mother, however, did not take them back. But how should one feed such ti=\r\nny&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; things? The squirrels laid in Ramana=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=\r\n=A2s palm. His face was glowing with love&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and af=\r\nfection towards them. The devotees looked on helplessly, but he was&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; happy and cheerful. He asked for some cotton and made a soft bed for&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; them.Then he took a piece of the cotton, rolled it up so that the end =\r\nlooked&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; like a sharp needle, dipped it into some milk and trickled =\r\nit in their tiny&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; mouths. This he did repeatedly. He looked after t=\r\nhem with great care and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; love until they grew up and started runnin=\r\ng around. They did not run away,&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; however, but always ran aro=\r\nund their =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9Cmother=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2.&lt;div class=3D=\r\n&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Something similar happened, when a cat ate the mot=\r\nher of some young&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; squirrels. Again Ramana took on the task of cari=\r\nng for the young. As he&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; liked to use daily events to teach h=\r\nis devotees he said to them, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93These&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; little ones do not know that wisdom lies in remaining in their nest=\r\n. They&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; keep attempting to come out. All trouble lies outside but t=\r\nhey cannot remain&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; within. Similarly if the mind is not externalise=\r\nd, but remains sunk in the&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; Heart then there would only be ha=\r\nppiness. But the mind keeps moving out.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; When Ranga=\r\nswami asked, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93What is the path for keeping it inward?=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC , Bhagavan&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; said, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93It is exactl=\r\ny the same as what I am doing now. Each time a young&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; squirrel comes out, I keep putting it back into its nest. When I go on=\r\n doing&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; it, it learns the happiness of staying in the nest.=\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Shantamma reports, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=\r\n=93Once Lakshmi came into the Hall. She was pregnant at&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; that time. It was after lunch time, when Bhagavan was reading the&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; newspapers. Lakshmi came near and started licking the papers. Bhaga=\r\nvan&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; looked up and said: =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9CWait a little, =\r\nLakshmi.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2 But Lakshmi went on licking.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Bhag=\r\navan laid his paper aside, put his hands behind Lakshmi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=\r\n=84=A2s horns and his&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; head against hers. Like th=\r\nis they stayed for quite a long time. I stood&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; nearby looking at th=\r\ne wonderful scene. After some ten minutes or so,&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; Bhagavan tu=\r\nrned to me and said: =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9CDo you know what Lakshmi is doing=\r\n? She is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; samadhi.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2 I looked at =\r\nher and tears were flowing in streams down her broad&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; cheeks. Her breathing had stopped and her eyes were fixed on Bhagavan.=\r\n After&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; some time Bhagavan changed his position and asked: =\r\n=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=CB=9CLakshmi, how do you feel&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; now?=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=\r\n=E2=84=A2 Lakshmi moved backwards, as if reluctant to turn her tail towards=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Bhagavan,walked round the Hall and went out.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC &lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Several dogs lived in the Ashram. The most=\r\n famous was Jackie,who was later&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; buried in the Ashram compound alo=\r\nngside the deer Valli and a crow. He did&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; not much like playing and=\r\n did not join the other dogs, but would sit in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; front of Sri Ramana=\r\n, fixing his gaze on his eyes incessantly. He would also&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; not start=\r\n eating until Ramana had taken a mouthful of food. One day when a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nstray dog entered the Ashram through the back door, Jackie started barking.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; Ramana calmed him saying, =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93You just clo=\r\nse your eyes. You just close your&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; eyes. You just=\r\n close your eyes. If you do this you will not be able to see&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n the dog.=C3=A2=E2=82=AC  At once Jackie closed his eyes.&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One day Jackie was attacked by a ferocious pig and was =\r\nseriously injured.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; His stomach was torn open and the intestines ca=\r\nme out. It required a lot of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; stitches to close it up and afterward=\r\ns Jackie was carried to a mantapam&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; opposite the Ashram to recover.=\r\n At the same time Kunju Swami was suffering&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; from a severe abscess =\r\non his foot and was also staying in the same mantapam.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; When Sri Ra=\r\nmana came to visit them, Kunju Swami was crying out in pain and&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; fell at Maharshi=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2s feet. But Ramana said to him,=\r\n =C3=A2=E2=82=AC=C5=93See, how Jackie is&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; silentl=\r\ny bearing his pain after such a major operation, without so much as a&lt;br&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&gt; whimper!=C3=A2=E2=82=AC  This was helpful to Kunju Swami and his =\r\npain became bearable for&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; him. Ramana stroked Jac=\r\nkie and enquired if the meal had been brought and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; then left both p=\r\natients.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Source: Ramana Maharshi: His Life A biography b=\r\ny Gabriele Ebert&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -- &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&gt; =C3=A0=C2=B0&quot;=\r\n=C3=A0=C2=B0=E2=80=9A  =C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=A8=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=AE=C3=A0=C2=B1=E2=\r\n=80=B9  =C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=AD=C3=A0=C2=B0=E2=80=94=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B5=C3=A0=C2=\r\n=B0=C2=A4=C3=A0=C2=B1=E2=80=A1  =C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B6=C3=A0=C2=B1 =C3=A0=C2=B0=\r\n=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=B1=E2=82=AC  =C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=AE=C3=A0=C2=\r\n=B0=C2=A3=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=BE=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=AF&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=AA=\r\n=C3=A0=C2=B1 =C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B6=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=BE=C3=A0=\r\n=C2=B0=E2=80=9A=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=A4=C3=A0=C2=B1   =C3=A0=C2=B0=C5=93=C3=A0=C2=\r\n=B0=C2=B2=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B8=C3=A0=C2=B1=E2=80=9A=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=A4=C3=A0=C2=\r\n=B1 =C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=B0=E2=80=9A&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=AA=C3=\r\n=A0=C2=B1 =C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=B1=E2=80=A1=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=AE=C3=A0=\r\n=C2=B1=E2=80=A1 =C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B6=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=BE=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B6=C3=\r\n=A0=C2=B1 =C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B5=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=A4=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=AE=C3=A0=C2=\r\n=B1 &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;co=\r\nlor:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd1b124a6400504802bfad2--\r\n\n"}}
