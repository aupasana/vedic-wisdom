Did God not anticipate the problems of having\n&gt; different=\r\n faiths? Or is it that He/She/IT wants us to go through\n&gt; these problem and=\r\n overcome our weakness to realize Self/God? \n \nWhen god comes to earth to e=\r\nstablish some measure of dharma, he is bound by the limitations of the time=\r\n and the place where he comes. Even god has to obey some limits of desa-kaa=\r\nla-paatra and that limits the amount of knowledge he can leave. Moreover, t=\r\nhe knowledge left by god (or a god-realized person) can slowly become corru=\r\npted by generations of followers who have a lower level of understanding. A=\r\n point will come when the knowledge is too corrupted to be useful anymore.\n=\r\n \nWords are just words. They have no absolute meaning. Based on our life ex=\r\nperiences, different words and sequences of words evoke different thoughts =\r\nin our mind. The process of transmitting one&#39;s thoughts to another person u=\r\nsing written words as a medium is imperfect, especially when two people are=\r\n separated by different times, cultures and thinking styles. Thus, as time =\r\npasses on, the thoughts evoked by the same set of words may change. What Je=\r\nsus or his disciples had in mind when Biblical texts were spoken 2000 years=\r\n back and how people understand those texts today can be significantly diff=\r\nerent. Religions and people&#39;s understanding become stale with time. Then go=\r\nd will have to find an appropriate time and come back or send somebody agai=\r\nn.\n \nEven though conflicts between some religions have created strife for s=\r\neveral people (and even some killings), it is still better than no relgion.=\r\n However imperfect, those religions ensured that some minimum level of dhar=\r\nma was maintained in the world. Without those religions, life may have been=\r\n more chaotic in some parts of the world.\n \nThere is one more thing. There =\r\nare different gunas in this world. People with too much of tamas and rajas,=\r\n even when they come in contact with sattwa, cannot become sattwik. When su=\r\nch people get involved in a religion or take charge, they corrupt it and en=\r\ngage in unfortunate acts in the name of religion. Really sattwik people in =\r\nall religions co-exist peacefully and practice their faith. It is the peopl=\r\ne with tamas and rajas who create strife. God cannot do anything about it.\n=\r\n \nGod acts through us. He either has to come down to earth to fix things or=\r\n he uses us to do it. For him to come down, adharma has to cross some thres=\r\nhhold.\n \nWhen we say that god does everything in the world, we are taking a=\r\nbout non-duality. The One Supreme Cosmic Being is the sum of all of us and =\r\nhe does all that all of us do. But, at the level of non-duality, there is n=\r\no good and bad. The good and bad we see is at the level of duality. The god=\r\ns who operate under the framework of duality, unlike the Supreme Cosmic Bei=\r\nng, are restricted in their operations. They have to obey the rules of Natu=\r\nre. They cannot change the world as they want. They can only do what the cu=\r\nrrent time allows. If the current time allows a lot of rajasik and tamasik =\r\npeople to control the world and if the current time does not allow god to c=\r\nome to earth, god will have to wait.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam You=\r\nrself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcas=\r\nt.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri J=\r\nagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Messa=\r\nge ----- \n  From: Murahari Vadapalli \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n =\r\n Sent: Monday, June 01, 2009 4:53 AM\n  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Multiple God=\r\ns and Conflicts\n\n        Namaste, \n\n        Scriptures and other great peop=\r\nle who have understood the essence of these scriptures say that God is ever=\r\nywhere.
