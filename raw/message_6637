They are called Dasanami sa=\r\nnnyasins, i.e., sannyasins with ten names. The credit of vigorous insistenc=\r\ne on the necessity for sannyasa goes solely to the adorable advaitic sannya=\r\nsin, the glorious Shankara!\n\nGlory, glory to the Sages, the gurus, the sann=\r\nyasins, who have opened our eyes from sleep, who have widened our hearts, b=\r\nrightened our intellects and immersed us in Supreme knowledge!\n\n\n"}}
