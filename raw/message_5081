Samadhi literally=\r\n means concentration and focus of awareness. In its normal state, mind is v=\r\nibrating with too many thoughts and notions. In any state of samadhi, most =\r\nof these thoughts and notions disappear and mind achieves a high degree of =\r\nfocus.\n \nThe focus can be on a physical object perceived through senses (e.=\r\ng. an idol or the physical sound of a mantra) or a subtle object perceived =\r\nby the subtle perception (a deity or the subtle vibration of a mantra). The=\r\n focus can be on the gross/subtle object or on the act of perceiving the ob=\r\nject or on the perceiver (all the three exist within one&#39;s consciousness as=\r\n three different things). One&#39;s self-awareness can identify with one object=\r\n and focus its attention on another object (&quot;I am Rajarshi with so and so q=\r\nualities and I am aware of Bhairava with so and so qualities&quot;). Or, one&#39;s s=\r\nelf-awareness can identify with that object (&quot;I am Bhairava with so and so =\r\nqualities&quot;). Please note that all these samadhis are within the field of du=\r\nality. There is still a sense of &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;this is the rest&quot;, i.e. t=\r\nhere is differentiation.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe next state is what mos=\r\nt people refer to as samadhi. This is a state where mind is absorbed in non=\r\n-dual Self, i.e. without any differentiation. When there are no notions of =\r\n&quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;this is the rest&quot;, there are no thoughts, no opposites and=\r\n there is only Sat-Chid-Ananda (the bliss of just being).\n \n*        *     =\r\n   *\n \nNow, let me come to what Vimalananda says!\n \nThe non-dual Self is Sh=\r\niva (or Purusha or Narayana). The field of duality is Shakti (or Prakriti o=\r\nr Narayani). Though one may normally think that Shiva and Shakti are differ=\r\nent, are they really different?!\n \nBecause of our notion that Shiva and Sha=\r\nkti are different, we can either be with Shakti or with Shiva at a time but=\r\n not with both at the same time. A yogi who has objectification and the sen=\r\nse of &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;this is the rest&quot; is in the domain of Shakti. When o=\r\nne overcomes objectification and reaches non-dual samadhi, one is in the do=\r\nmain of Shiva. When one leaves that state and one&#39;s egosense (&quot;this is I&quot; a=\r\nnd &quot;this is the rest&quot;) returns, one will *leave* the domain of Shiva and re=\r\n-enter the field of Shakti. One is prone to be deluded by duality again! Th=\r\nat is what Vimalananda is saying.\n \nIf one can be with Shiva *and* Shakti a=\r\nt the *same time*, then one is then not enamored or deluded by any aspect o=\r\nf Shakti. When a small aspect of Shakti enamors/deludes one (&quot;this is I&quot;, &quot;=\r\nthat is beautiful&quot;, &quot;that is ugly&quot;, &quot;I like that&quot; etc), one is unable to pe=\r\nrceive the entire field of Shakti. This is just like a person tied to a roc=\r\nk in the ocean not being able to swim the entire ocean. When one is not bou=\r\nnd by any object in the field of Shakti and not attracted or repelled by an=\r\nything, then one can navigate the entire field, i.e. all space-time combina=\r\ntions. This is possible only if one has perfect mastery over Shakti. That c=\r\nomes only when one has zero attachment to anything in the field of Shakti. =\r\nThat comes only when one is with Shiva enough and eventually becomes like S=\r\nhiva. If a yogi reaches non-dual samadhi, stays in it for a long time and h=\r\nappens to come back to the field of duality, then one may become like Shiva=\r\n and work with Shakti with zero attachment and perfect mastery. One is awar=\r\ne of the entire field of duality - all spaces and times - and yet unattache=\r\nd to anything. That is because one perceives the underlying non-dual Self e=\r\nven as senses perceive various objects of duality.\n \nFor most people, this =\r\nis out of bounds. One either experiences non-dual samadhi for a short durat=\r\nion and cannot sustain it longer and comes back to be deluded by duality ag=\r\nain, or one stays in non-dual samadhi for a long time and does not come bac=\r\nk (like a salt doll that goes to survey the depth of ocean melting in the o=\r\ncean, to borrow words from Ramakrishna Paramahamsa). Exceptions like Ramakr=\r\nishna Paramahamsa or Sai Baba, who spent enough time in non-dual samadhi an=\r\nd yet came back to live in the world, are so rare in this age.\n \n*        *=\r\n        *\n \nLet me put this in terms of Kundalini now. When Kundalini is in=\r\n moolaadhaara, our self-awareness identifies with the physical body and is =\r\naware of the physical world around us. As Kundalini goes to various places =\r\nin the subtle body (there are thousands of nadis and chakras!), one is awar=\r\ne of various realities that are out there in this universe. For example, on=\r\ne world (realm of awareness) may be reverberating with the sound of a parti=\r\ncular beejaakshara and filled with a particular light and every being in th=\r\nat world may be a small particle in that light reverberating with that soun=\r\nd. Like that, there are many worlds out there (within us) and one can enter=\r\n a samadhi through any of them, when Kundalini reaches a corresponding plac=\r\ne.\n \nWhen Kundalini reaches sahasrara, one&#39;s self-awareness is with Shiva. =\r\nShakti loses herself to Shiva and there is no objectification that is the h=\r\nallmark of Shakti. If shakti comes back from sahasrara to a lower chakra, o=\r\nne&#39;s self-awareness is again deluded by duality. However, if shakti comes b=\r\nack from sahasrara to mooladhara *accompanied by* Shiva, then one is aware =\r\nof duality and non-dual Self at the same time. One lives as a liberated sag=\r\ne, using the body as an instrument to fulfil the will of Nature (since ther=\r\ne is no longer any individual will).\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish So=\r\nftware, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourse=\r\nlf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://S=\r\naraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n-=\r\n--- hramalingam@... wrote: \n&gt; The Samadi is nothing but killing the m=\r\nind and the entire thought process\n&gt; This will answer all your questions\n&gt; =\r\nSent from my BlackBerry=C2=AE on Reliance Mobile, India&#39;s No. 1 Network.

What is the use of these spurting samadhis, anyway? Fine=\r\n you go off into \n&gt; a trance, but when you drop back down to earth, you are=\r\n just as you were before. \n&gt; That sort of samadhi is always seperate from t=\r\nhe normal waking &#39;you&#39;. I think it \n&gt; is much better to retain consciousnes=\r\ns on this plane even while you shift your \n&gt; main focus to other realities.=\r\n Here I am playing chess with you, but as I play I \n&gt; can go to America to =\r\ncheck how your parents are doing, or I can visit Patala \n&gt; (the underworld)=\r\n, or the planet Venus, or my Guru Maharaj, or whatever I please, \n&gt; and sti=\r\nll sit here acting as if I know nothing. \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; To be truly aware you ha=\r\nve to know what is happening far away today, what had \n&gt; happened here long=\r\n ago, and what is going to happen anywhere in the cosmos \n&gt; during  the com=\r\ning decades. But all the while you continue to function \n&gt; effectively in t=\r\nhis time, space and causality. Awareness on all levels at all \n&gt; times - TH=\r\nAT sort of enlightenment has some use.&quot; - (Vimalananda) Aghora III The \n&gt; l=\r\naw of Karma.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;   Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; You are not in=\r\ncorrect, but not fully correct. Moreover, it is tough to capture \n&gt; some of=\r\n these ideas in words, as words convey slightly different meaning to \n&gt; dif=\r\nferent people, based on their life experiences and predispositions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Ye=\r\ns, there is no formula that ensures self-realization in a certain amount of=\r\n \n&gt; time and it comes to one through the grace of God. However, grace of Go=\r\nd does \n&gt; not come to just about anyone - it comes to one who is *ready* to=\r\n receive it. \n&gt; One becomes ready to receive it, through the effort put in =\r\nthis life and all \n&gt; previous lives, to overcome weaknesses and conditionin=\r\ng. So effort and sadhana \n&gt; are not useless. The effort we are talking abou=\r\nt here is not effort to acquire \n&gt; something, but effort to give up somethi=\r\nng.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though it is not incorrect, the view that things are given only by=\r\n God&#39;s grace \n&gt; can, when misunderstood, promote inaction. God&#39;s grace does=\r\n not come to a lazy \n&gt; person doing nothing and waiting for God&#39;s grace. Go=\r\nd&#39;s grace does not work \n&gt; arbitrarily. God&#39;s grace comes to one who has pe=\r\nrfect surrender to God. Perfect \n&gt; surrender does not come automatically. T=\r\nhough effort and sadhana do not \n&gt; guarantee perfect surrender in a certain=\r\n amount of time, they do bring it \n&gt; eventually.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; whatever=\r\n one does it is based on past karmas only\n&gt; \n&gt; Fruits of past karmas decide=\r\n one&#39;s current situation and constrain one&#39;s current \n&gt; karmas (actions). B=\r\nut they do not completely decide one&#39;s current karmas. One&#39;s \n&gt; current kar=\r\nma is in one&#39;s hands (within the constraints).\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, one can ask:=\r\n Does one have a free will that acts or does an \n&gt; all-pervading shakti act=\r\n through one? I am quoting a small portion from \n&gt; vedic-wisdom message 500=\r\n9 \n&gt; (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/5009) below:\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nAll pervading shakti works through all of us and expresses through all of o=\r\nur \n&gt; desires, actions and knowledge. But then, some universal rules of act=\r\nion and \n&gt; reaction govern how this works. Under the push of one&#39;s own prev=\r\nious karmas, one \n&gt; is placed in situations that are conducive to certain d=\r\nesires, actions and \n&gt; awareness. The current karmas in those situations ma=\r\ny further modify the \n&gt; momentum of the push (reaction) from previous actio=\r\nns. Though one&#39;s current \n&gt; desires, actions and awareness are actually the=\r\n work of the all pervading \n&gt; shakti, they are also one&#39;s work in a way. It=\r\n depends on how we look at it and \n&gt; how we abstract it. Though Ganges wate=\r\nr in a bucket, Ganges water in a small \n&gt; cup, Ganges water in a cup in hot=\r\n weather and Ganges water in a cup in freezing \n&gt; weather are all Ganges wa=\r\nter, they are different too. One is more, one is less, \n&gt; one is warm and o=\r\nne is icy. Similarly, the work of all pervading shakti is\n&gt; different when =\r\nexpressed through different vessels (people) in different \n&gt; situations.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; As long as one actually feels internally (despite what one may say or pr=\r\netend \n&gt; externally) that one&#39;s desires, actions and knowledge are one&#39;s ow=\r\nn, one is \n&gt; performing karmas and is bound to receive their kaarmik reacti=\r\nons. Only when the\n&gt; realization that it is all the work of the all pervadi=\r\nng shakti becomes full and \n&gt; completely internalized, does one become free=\r\n from the cycle of actions and \n&gt; reactions. Until then, all pervading shak=\r\nti acts through one to give appropriate \n&gt; reactions to actions one thinks =\r\none is performing.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; In astrological terms, horoscope is the =\r\nsum total of previous karmas, whose \n&gt; fruits one will have to face. They s=\r\nhow the circumstances faced by one. They do \n&gt; not and cannot determine wha=\r\nt actions one engages in, though certain actions are \n&gt; more likely in cert=\r\nain circumstances.\n&gt; \n&gt; Destiny is the sum total of the reactions to the ac=\r\ntions committed by one&#39;s free \n&gt; will. Today&#39;s actions of free will become =\r\ndestiny tomorrow (i.e. on a future \n&gt; date or in a future life).\n&gt; \n&gt; Best =\r\nregards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- hramalingam@... wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Samadi sta=\r\nte is not like getting a degree by hardwork It comes to certain \n&gt; &gt;people =\r\nby the Grace of GOD Till GOD or Soul decides to reveal the Samadi state \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;whatever one does it is based on past karmas only\n&gt; &gt; Ramanapatham\n&gt; &gt; Sen=\r\nt from my BlackBerry=C2=AE on Reliance Mobile, India&#39;s No. 1 Network.

However, we \n&gt; &gt;cannot compare ourselv=\r\nes with special beings and we should follow rules and \n&gt; &gt;austerities laid =\r\nout in tradition. Tendulkar may score a century with a terrible \n&gt; &gt;backach=\r\ne, but we should not walk out to bat with a backache and should try to be \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;healthy. After all, we may not be able to score runs well even when in p=\r\nerfect \n&gt; &gt;health!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, it must be realized =\r\nthat external rules are only meant as a \n&gt; &gt;*catalyst* in enabling internal=\r\n transformation. The goal of all sadhana - \n&gt; &gt;meditation, japam, homam, bh=\r\najan, service to others etc - is internal \n&gt; &gt;transformation. If the intern=\r\nal attitude is not getting refined, sadhana is yet \n&gt; &gt;to work.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * =\r\n* *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If a room has a window outside of which there is heavy wind th=\r\nat is constantly \n&gt; &gt;blowing a lot of dirt into the room, sweeping the room=\r\n with a broom does not \n&gt; &gt;eliminate dirt. First close the window or stop t=\r\nhe wind. Similarly, praanaayaama \n&gt; &gt;is not enough to purify the nadis and =\r\ngive mental purity, if mind (room) is \n&gt; &gt;attached to the objects perceived=\r\n by senses (window).\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one reads scriptures and te=\r\nachings of saints, contemplates on them, \n&gt; &gt;constantly analyzes inner moti=\r\nves behind various actions by oneself and tries to \n&gt; &gt;change one&#39;s own thi=\r\nnking slowly, this process of contemplation and \n&gt; &gt;introspection will augm=\r\nent one&#39;s external sadhana (such as meditation, japam, \n&gt; &gt;homam, bhajan, s=\r\nervice etc) and purifies one faster.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, it=\r\n is useless to think in terms of Kundalini, awakening Kundalini \n&gt; &gt;and rai=\r\nsing Kundalini. Such thoughts are almost guaranteed to either block \n&gt; &gt;Kun=\r\ndalini from rising or from reaching the highest it can.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini =\r\nshakti is essentially a symbol of one&#39;s own self-awareness. Though \n&gt; &gt;one =\r\nis the infinite Self (Purusha), one is &quot;aware&quot; of a limited object in the \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;field of duality (Shakti) springing in Self as &quot;self&quot;. That is why Kunda=\r\nlini \n&gt; &gt;shakti is worshipped as a form of the divine Mother (Shakti). This=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;self-awareness is normally &quot;sleeping&quot;, i.e. one assumes that one is so=\r\n and so \n&gt; &gt;person and so and so body without questioning &quot;who am I&quot;. That =\r\nis why Kundalini \n&gt; &gt;is portrayed as sleeping in Mooladhara chakra (bhuloka=\r\n or physical realm). As \n&gt; &gt;Kundalini awakens and rises to other chakras (o=\r\nther lokas or realms of \n&gt; &gt;awareness), one&#39;s understanding of who one is g=\r\nets refined. When Kundalini \n&gt; &gt;reaches sahasrara, one is aware of true Sel=\r\nf.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one thinks &quot;I am this body. There is a Kundalini shakti at s=\r\no and so point \n&gt; &gt;in this body. It should now rise to so and so point in t=\r\nhis body&quot;, it will focus \n&gt; &gt;and limit one&#39;s self-awareness to the *physica=\r\nl body* and hence one&#39;s Kundalini \n&gt; &gt;will remain in moolaadhaara! For Kund=\r\nalini to truly rise, one needs to \n&gt; &gt;completely forget about the physical =\r\nbody and stop thinking in terms of it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way, *very few* peop=\r\nle actually experience Kundalini in higher chakras, \n&gt; &gt;though many talk ab=\r\nout it. Kundalini is in Moolaadhaara chakra or atmost \n&gt; &gt;Swadhishthana cha=\r\nkra in most yogis, even advanced and awakened ones.

Some may mistaken it for Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you want=\r\n a good score in the examination, study well. Stop thinking too much \n&gt; &gt;ab=\r\nout (and anticipating) the examination and focus on the subject instead. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;Study, study, study. Similarly, forget about kundalini, forget about chak=\r\nras, \n&gt; &gt;forget about the body even. Do sadhana, do sadhana and do sadhana.=\r\n Read \n&gt; &gt;scriptures and teachings of great saints. Instead of looking exte=\r\nrnally and \n&gt; &gt;judging others, observe your own actions and thoughts, analy=\r\nze what is driving \n&gt; &gt;them and consciously try to eliminate wrong motives =\r\nthat stem from false ego, \n&gt; &gt;adharma and arishadvarga (lust, anger, greed,=\r\n delusion, wantonness, jealosy), \n&gt; &gt;i.e. put to use the knowledge of scrip=\r\ntures and the teachings of saints.
