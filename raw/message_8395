Those who kn=\r\now dont write and those who write dont know.

The system is designed to kee=\r\np you subservient and perpetuate itself.  Life is way too short to waste it=\r\n.  Seek for a way out!  Sorcery and Tantra is about Freedom, especially fre=\r\nedom from mental shackles.  It will give you the edge you need to get ahead=\r\n in life.  Seek for freedom from the Matrix and its archons.  Emancipate yo=\r\nurself even if it is only mentally!  You are a spark of the Divine and are =\r\nmeant for greater things than this!&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are couple of FB forum =\r\nbut they mostly dish around sadhanas for solving issues and provide less th=\r\neory on tantra. one guy post his tantra sadhana journey, all i can say is t=\r\nhat on that path fanatics only reach such high levels.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; and if=\r\n you want to read about bhairavies \n&gt; &gt; (good interpretation must otherwise=\r\n ull get lost in words)\n&gt; &gt; Diaries of a Bhairavi\n&gt; &gt; http://www.newrealiti=\r\nes.com/index.php/component/content/category/170-diaries-of-bhairavi?start=\r\n=3D50\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; there are enough clues to find her out. she is a dancer in j=\r\nakarta i guess. she teaches some basic classes also and quite accessible.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; in case you find any good links do share.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sunrise_1080&quot; &lt;sunrise_108=\r\n0@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Rajarshi ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Than=\r\nk you for the very interesting information about tantra, a subject I know v=\r\nery little about. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It sounds fascinating. Making an idol of Du=\r\nrga from the mud collected from the house of a widow and a prostitute! I in=\r\nterpret that ritual to demonstrate that Durga abides in the heart of a pros=\r\ntitute as much as she does in the heart of a saint, and so the soil from bo=\r\nth their houses is equally sacred. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m glad to hear you say t=\r\nhat tantra has so many women of high spiritual calibre...that&#39;s very inspir=\r\ning. What a pity we don&#39;t hear much about them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I recently rea=\r\nd a wonderful book about the women saints of India, called &quot;Daughters of th=\r\ne Goddess&quot;, written by an American devotee of the Goddess (Linda Johnsen). =\r\nShe asked the same question &quot;Where are the women saints of India?&quot;. A Pandi=\r\nt ji replied, &quot;just because they don&#39;t stand on public stages and give semi=\r\nnars, doesn&#39;t mean they don&#39;t exist!&quot;. Linda then went on a pilgrimage to I=\r\nndia and met Ammachi (of Kerala), Anandi Ma and other living realised saint=\r\ns in the female form. I&#39;ve met Amma, but would love to meet some of the yog=\r\ninis and Bhairavis you mention.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m curious about tantra and w=\r\nould like to learn more about it. I like Japa as my main spiritual practice=\r\n,  but I&#39;m open to learning about other paths (tantra probably includes Jap=\r\na for all I know). And learning more about Goddess worship would be great. =\r\nI see Durga as my spiritual guide, keeping me on the path, doing the Sadhan=\r\na with me (because I&#39;m too lazy to do it on my own), and Hari as the goal (=\r\nactually they&#39;re the same in my head and are both my goal as my divine pare=\r\nnts). The cowherd girls of yore, clever girls, knew that the Goddess alone =\r\ncould give them Hari...as we all know, they famously worshipped Katyayani a=\r\nsking for Krishna, and She gave Him to them! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please could you=\r\n reccommend some articles/books on tantra. I would love to have a read and =\r\neducate myself on this, and may be even, add something to my practice. My o=\r\nnly worhip of Durga currently (aside from abusing and praising her alternat=\r\nely) is repeating her mantra Om Dum Durgayai Namaha (or Om Shri Durgayai Na=\r\nmaha) randomly. (My main mantra that I got intiated into from a Swami of th=\r\ne Sivananda tradition is Om Namo Narayanaya.) And I have recently added hom=\r\nams to my practice, albeit only once in 2 weeks, and I worship both her and=\r\n Hari with it (it&#39;s not a perfect homam technique wise, but I try and put a=\r\n bit of heart in it. And if I can&#39;t find any heart, I blame Durga for not g=\r\niving me any! She gets a lot of abuse from me I&#39;m afraid, but as she made m=\r\ne, it&#39;s her own fault). \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks again for the message, and her=\r\ne&#39;s to tantra, the path that treats women as equals! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aparna\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
