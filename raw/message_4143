Some of them are meaningful to an =\r\nextent and some of them are simply made up over the last few millennia by i=\r\nntellectuals.\n\nHowever, if one is doing a daily or weekly homam for the ple=\r\nasure of a deity, one can and should ignore these technicalities.\n\nThere ar=\r\ne some traditional brahmanas who have been doing a Ganpathi homam everyday =\r\nas a sadhana for many generations and they do not look at these technicalit=\r\nies.\n\n* * *\n\nIf Agni (fire god) leaves earth completely and goes to heavens=\r\n (aakaasha) or netherworld (paataala), there would be no activity on earth.=\r\n You cannot breathe, digest food, think or move your body. Even flow of sig=\r\nnals in the nerves requires Agni. Agni is present everywhere at all times. =\r\nEven during his residence in heavens or netherworld, Agni is certainly capa=\r\nble of acting on earth, receiving our oblations here on earth and making th=\r\nem reach various deities.\n\n* * *\n\nIf you want to get your father (or mother=\r\n) to buy you a car or to give you money to start a business, you may want t=\r\no pick a good time to see him and talk about it (e.g. when he is not tired =\r\nafter quarrel with someone and when he is in a good mood). Of course, even =\r\nwhen you think you picked a good time, it may be a bad time and your father=\r\n may not be in a good mood. However, if you do not have any such agendas an=\r\nd only want to tell your father &quot;I love you&quot; and take whatever he gives, yo=\r\nu can do it anytime. In fact, the latter kind of child will be favored by p=\r\narents over the long run and will get whatever the parents have to give.\n\nS=\r\nimilarly, if you want to get a specific material result, there are several =\r\ntechnicalities to bother about. Even when you bother about them, you may no=\r\nt get it right. As I keep emphasizing now and then, there are many corrupti=\r\nons in our understanding of the technicalities and the art of getting speci=\r\nfic material results through rituals is nearly extinct. The best approach i=\r\ns to surrender to your deity, use homam or meditation to express your love =\r\nand surrender and take whatever you are given in return as a prasad. Such a=\r\n person will be favored by deities over the long run.\n\n* * *\n\nNamaste Ramak=\r\nishore,\n\nDifferent points of space and different points of time have a diff=\r\nerent quality to them. Sadhana in Boston is not the same as sadhana in Girn=\r\nar hills or Arunachala hills. Sadhana on a Chauturthi is not the same as sa=\r\ndhana on Pournima.\n\nIf one is doing a specific sadhana occasionally (e.g. a=\r\n monthly Satya Narayana pooja or a monthly Chandi homam or a monthly Krishn=\r\na homam), it is not a bad idea to pick a day/time that is aligned with the =\r\nenergy of that deity.\n\nHowever, one can only make so much progress with occ=\r\nasional sadhana. To make real progress and to experience divinity, more int=\r\nense sadhana is needed. If one is into serious sadhana with a mantra/deity,=\r\n one can do it every day and at all times.\n\n* * *\n\nA lot of beggars may be =\r\nstanding at the gate of a king&#39;s palace, waiting for the king to see them w=\r\nhen leaving/entering the palace and give them some money. That king may be =\r\nknown to step out of the house to go to a specific place on every so and so=\r\n day and there may be a bigger crowd of beggars gathering at his gate on th=\r\nat day. But, by standing at the gate on that day along with so many beggars=\r\n, you may or may not be able to get something from the king. On the other h=\r\nand, if you simply stand at the gate everyday, king&#39;s eyes may fall on you =\r\nsomeday!\n\nHave the attitude of a beggar, surrender to the deity, keep doing=\r\n your chosen sadhana everyday and patiently wait for the deity&#39;s grace. Tha=\r\nt is a sureshot formula for success.\n\n* * *\n\nThe issue of auspicious days a=\r\nnd times is a double edged sword. While a particular day may be more auspic=\r\nious than other days, it may or may not mean much to one. For example, if a=\r\n particular cricket pitch is easier to bat on, you cannot expect to go ther=\r\ne and score a century. International cricketers such as Tendulkar, Gambhir =\r\nand Sehwag may score more runs there than at other places, but you may stil=\r\nl get out cheaply.\n\nInstead of helping, sadhana done on a particularly good=\r\n day can sometimes bog one down with false pride and expectancy. I remember=\r\n one incident.\n\nA few years ago, I decided oneday in spring that I wanted t=\r\no spend the coming Saturday meditating with the Gayatri mantra for the whol=\r\ne day. I got that intention from nowhere and did not look at anything like =\r\ntithi, my horoscope etc. I simply decided to go ahead. I mentioned it to Ma=\r\nnish and he said, &quot;excellent, go ahead&quot;. I meditated with Gayatri mantra fr=\r\nom 5 am till 9:30 pm, getting up only a few times for 2-minute breaks and h=\r\naving a fistful of saattwik food for lunch in the middle of the day. When I=\r\n finished in the night, I was in a nice state.\n\nNext morning, I realized th=\r\nat the previous day was Akshaya Tritiya (Vaisakha Sukla Tritiya, birthday o=\r\nf Ganga and Parasurama and the day Tretayuga started). It is said that spir=\r\nitual sadhana done on Akshaya Tritiya is 1,000 times more effective than a =\r\nnormal day. I was excited that the day I picked at random happened to be an=\r\n auspicious day.\n\nI mentioned it to Manish. He said, &quot;I knew it was Akshaya=\r\n Tritiya even when you mentioned the intention to me&quot;. I asked him why he d=\r\nid not tell that to me then. He curtly remarked, &quot;knowing you were doing th=\r\nis sadhana on Akshaya Tritiya would not have helped and would have instead =\r\ndistracted you.&quot;\n\nHe was right. As such, I was a little &quot;proud&quot; of the sadh=\r\nana - spending the whole day in japam. There was a bit of excitement and ex=\r\npectancy that was present as an undercurrent and somewhat distracted my foc=\r\nus on the mantra. Had I known that I was doing it on a day when sadhana is =\r\nsupposed to be 1,000 times more effective, that undercurrent of useless exc=\r\nitement would&#39;ve been higher and distracted me even more!\n\nBottomline: Thum=\r\nbrules of all kinds exist. But what really matters is the state of your min=\r\nd. Sometimes, doing a sadhana on an auspicious day can create excitement an=\r\nd expectancy and distract one. Doing the same sadhana everyday and patientl=\r\ny waiting for it to succeed oneday is perhaps a simpler and more foolproof =\r\nstrategy.

I increasingly find that astrology is only serving to disco=\r\nurage the masses rather than pointing them in the direction of worship of d=\r\nivinity. \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope you could throw some light on this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Vemp=\r\narla Ram Kishore \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      __________________________________________=\r\n________________________\nThe new Internet Explorer=C2=AE 8 - Faster, safer,=\r\n easier.

He said, &quot;I k=\r\nnew it was Akshaya Tritiya even when you mentioned the intention to me&quot;. I =\r\nasked him why he did not tell that to me then. He curtly remarked, &quot;knowing=\r\n you were doing this sadhana on Akshaya Tritiya would not have helped and w=\r\nould have instead distracted you.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He was right. As such, I was a li=\r\nttle &quot;proud&quot; of the sadhana - spending the whole day in japam. There was a =\r\nbit of\n excitement and expectancy that was present as an undercurrent and s=\r\nomewhat distracted my focus on the mantra. Had I known that I was doing it =\r\non a day when sadhana is supposed to be 1,000 times more effective, that un=\r\ndercurrent of useless excitement would&#39;ve been higher and distracted me eve=\r\nn more!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline: Thumbrules of all kinds exist. But what really m=\r\natters is the state of your mind. Sometimes, doing a sadhana on an auspicio=\r\nus day can create excitement and expectancy and distract one. Doing the sam=\r\ne sadhana everyday and patiently waiting for it to succeed oneday is perhap=\r\ns a simpler and more foolproof strategy.
