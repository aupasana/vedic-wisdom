All other procedures are just in name and placebo&#39;s.\n\nRather=\r\n than worry about Prana Prathisthapana of the Idol...I would suggest comple=\r\nte surrender and forming an personal relationship with the Idol.By  which I=\r\n mean if you are able to visualize the idol or the particular form of god d=\r\nown to the minutest details when you meditate it might help you immensely i=\r\nn transforming your mind.\n\n(7) are the yantras available in the market good=\r\n enough or should one make one&#39;s\nown yantra? if yes, then please guide with=\r\n regard to shree, gayatri and\nmahamrityunjay yantras?\n\n\nThe best yantra one=\r\n can make is transforming one&#39;s own body. This piece of mechanism is simply=\r\n amazing and was created with extreme care by the creator. Simply sitting a=\r\nt one place and meditating with one particular mantra everyday at the same =\r\ntime as Narasimha Ji has mentioned will help one immensely.\n\nAgain it is ju=\r\nst my personal opinion, none of the stuff advertised on TV works.\n\nIf you a=\r\nre seriously interested ,there is an temple in Andhra Pradesh ( Devipuram )=\r\n who build limited Sri Meru&#39;s ( 3D form of Sri Chakra) using precise instru=\r\nments in limited quantities. They are also energized by an living master Am=\r\nritananda Natha .They only charge a nominal fee , do not advertise much and=\r\n do not scare people with million rules. There are a few rules of cleanline=\r\nss and if possible chanting one&#39;s favourite mantra. They do not claim this =\r\nYantra will bestow material prosperity, it is only for spiritual upliftment=\r\n.\n\nIf interested please go through this link.\n\n http://www.devipuram.com/in=\r\ndex.php?option=3Dcom_content&view=3Darticle&id=3D78&Itemid=3D164\n\nIf you ar=\r\ne apprehensive and want to experiment..there is a nice powerpoint on the sa=\r\nme site with explanation to draw an 2D Sri chakra everyday.I beleive that p=\r\nractise also purifies one immensely.\n\nI apologize beforehand if my views of=\r\nfend any of the group members.\n\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore\n\n--- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;jha.dolly&quot; &lt;jha.dolly@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; dear friend=\r\ns,\n&gt; \n&gt; need answers to a few of my queries. hope to get guidance from expe=\r\nrinced sadhaks like you. here they go:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1)i have a friend whose life s=\r\neems to be a mess for quite some time now and some people have suggested to=\r\n her that she was born under something called &quot;Mool Nakshtra&quot; and there was=\r\n supposed to be a pooja done for it after 20 days of her birth which was no=\r\nt done hence these problems in her life.\n&gt; \n&gt; can any of you please clarify=\r\n what this thing is about and which pooja should now  be done by/for her to=\r\n stabilise her life.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2)also,is there ay upcoming auspicious day when =\r\ni can start my daily jaap and havan for the rest of my life?\n&gt; \n&gt; (3)also i=\r\nf i want to light a lifelong lamp for myself(as suggested by sri narasimha =\r\nji)then when should i do it? what  could be a possible auspicious occason f=\r\nor it? and what are its dos and donts?\n&gt; \n&gt; (4)if i begin by doing the ganp=\r\nati havan then for how many days/ months should i do it before going on to =\r\nthe havan of other deiities?\n&gt; \n&gt; (5) what exactly is the difference in mea=\r\nning and purpose of mantras chanted as &quot;gam&quot; and &quot;gang&quot;?\n&gt; \n&gt; (6)what is th=\r\ne &quot;Exact Procedure&quot; and mantras for the praan pratishtha of mahamrityunjay =\r\nyantra or  shiva idol? what are the dos and donts of it?\n&gt; \n&gt; (7) are the y=\r\nantras available in the market good enough or should one make one&#39;s own yan=\r\ntra? if yes, then please guide with regard to shree, gayatri and mahamrityu=\r\nnjay yantras?\n&gt; \n&gt; phew!!!too many questions....but i am only a baby in thi=\r\ns field...so please bear with me and help me guys :) \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; awaiting your=\r\n response.\n&gt; \n&gt; thanks and regards,\n&gt; dolly.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
