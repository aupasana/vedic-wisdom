Learn to=\r\n make the whole world your own. No one\nis a stranger, my child; the whole w=\r\norld is your own.\n\nSwami Vivekananda -- This is the gist of all worship -- =\r\nto be pure and to do\ngood to others. He who sees Siva in the poor, in the w=\r\neak, and in the\ndiseased, really worships Siva, and if he sees Siva only in=\r\n the image, his\nworship is but preliminary. He who has served and helped on=\r\ne poor man seeing\nSiva in him, without thinking of his cast, creed, or race=\r\n, or anything, with\nhim Siva is more pleased than with the man who sees Him=\r\n only in temples.\n\nBuddha -- Goodwill toward all beings is the true religio=\r\nn; cherish in your\nhearts boundless goodwill to all that lives.\n\nGuru Nanak=\r\n -- God is one, but He has innumerable forms. He is the Creator of\nall and =\r\nHe Himself takes the human form.\n\nJesus Christ -- But I say unto you, love =\r\nyour enemies, bless them that curse\nyou, do good to them that hate you, and=\r\n pray for them which despitefully use\nyou, and persecute you. That you may =\r\nbe the children of your Father which is\nin heaven; for he makes his sun to =\r\nrise on the evil and on the good, and\nsends rain on the just and on the unj=\r\nust.\n\nJudaism -- You shall not hate your brother in your heart, but you sha=\r\nll\nreason with your neighbor, lest you bear in sin because of him. You shal=\r\nl\nnot take vengeance or bear any grudge against the sons of your own people=\r\n,\nbut you shall love your neighbor as yourself.\n\nKrishna -- He who sees the=\r\n Supreme Lord abiding alike in all beings, and not\nperishing when they peri=\r\nsh - verily, he alone sees.\n\nMohammed -- All God=E2=80=99s creatures are Hi=\r\ns family; and he is the most beloved\nof God who tries to do most good to Go=\r\nd=E2=80=99s creatures.\n\nNative American -- Every dawn as it comes is a holy=\r\n event, and every day is\nholy, for the light comes from your Father, Wakan-=\r\nTanka; and also always\nremember that the two-leggeds and all other peoples =\r\nwho stand upon this\nearth are sacred and should be treated as such.\n\nRama -=\r\n- It is the shadow of the Paramatman that you see reflected in all the\nlivi=\r\nng beings as the Jivatman. Don=E2=80=99t you see the great sky reflected in=\r\n each\nand every lake or river?\n\nSankara -- Vishnu alone it is who dwells in=\r\n you, in me, in everything; Empty\nof meaning is your wrath, and the impatie=\r\nnce you reveal. Seeing yourself in\neveryone, have done with all diversity.\n=\r\n\nVedas -- The wise man beholds all beings in the Self, and the Self in all\n=\r\nbeings; for that reason he does not hate anyone.\n\nZoroaster -- Forget self =\r\nand identify Ahura Mazda in every being and in\neverything.\n\n\nGOD IS WITHIN =\r\nYOU\n\nSri Ramakrishna -- Do you know what I see? I see Him as all. Men and o=\r\nther\ncreatures appear to me only as hollow forms, moving their heads and ha=\r\nnds\nand feet, but within is the Lord Himself.\n\nHoly Mother -- When one real=\r\nizes God, He grants knowledge and illumination\nfrom within; one knows it on=\r\neself. In the fullness of one=E2=80=99s spiritual\nrealization one will find=\r\n that He who resides in one=E2=80=99s heart, resides in the\nhearts of other=\r\ns as well - the oppressed, the persecuted, the untouchable,\nand the outcast=\r\n.\n\nSwami Vivekananda -- It is impossible to find God outside of ourselves. =\r\nOur\nown souls contribute all of the divinity that is outside of us. We are =\r\nthe\ngreatest temple. The objectification is only a faint imitation of what =\r\nwe\nsee within ourselves.\n\nBuddha -- The subject on which I meditate is trut=\r\nh. The practice to which I\ndevote myself is the truth. The topic of my conv=\r\nersation is truth. My\nthoughts are always in truth. For lo! my self has bec=\r\nome the truth.\n\nGuru Nanak -- As fragrance abides in the flower,\nAs the ref=\r\nlection is within the mirror,\nSo doth thy Lord abide within thee,\nWhy searc=\r\nh Him without?\n\nJesus Christ -- Being asked by the Pharisees when the kingd=\r\nom of God was\ncoming, he answered them, &quot;The kingdom of God is not coming w=\r\nith signs to be\nobserved; nor will they say, =E2=80=98Lo, here it is!=E2=80=\r\n=99 or =E2=80=98There!=E2=80=99 for behold, the\nkingdom of God is within yo=\r\nu.&quot;\n\nJudaism -- Create in me a clean heart, O God, and put a new and right =\r\nspirit\nwithin me. Cast me not away from thy presence, and take not the holy=\r\n Spirit\nfrom me.\n\nKrishna -- I am the Self, O Gudekesa, seated in the heart=\r\ns of all creatures.\nI am the beginning, the middle, and the end of all bein=\r\ngs.\n\nMohammed -- He who knows his own self, knows God.\n\nNative American -- =\r\nThe first peace, which is most important, is that which\ncomes within the so=\r\nuls of men when they realize their relationship, their\noneness, with the un=\r\niverse and all its Powers, and when they realize that at\nthe center of the =\r\nuniverse dwells Wakan-Tanka, and that this center is\nreally everywhere, it =\r\nis within each of us. This is the real Peace, and the\nothers are but reflec=\r\ntions of this. The second peace is that which is made\nbetween two individua=\r\nls, and the third is that which is made between two\nnations. But above all =\r\nyou should understand that there can never be peace\nbetween nations until t=\r\nhere is first known that true peace which, as I have\noften said, is within =\r\nthe souls of men.\n\nRama -- Think that you are Parabrahman, you have no atta=\r\nchment, you are\nall-knowing and you are pure. Always feel like this and est=\r\nablish your\noneness with the Paramatman and derive bliss within yourself wi=\r\nthout caring\nto know what is outside of you.\n\nSankara -- Cherish your Guru=\r\n=E2=80=99s lotus feet and free yourself without delay\nfrom the enslavement =\r\nto this world. Curb your senses and your mind and see\nthe Lord within your =\r\nheart.\n\nVedas -- There is one Supreme Ruler, the inmost Self of all beings,=\r\n who\nmakes His one form manifold. Eternal happiness belongs to the wise, wh=\r\no\nperceive Him within themselves - not to others.\n\nZoroaster -- One need no=\r\nt scale the heights of the heavens nor travel along\nthe highways of the wor=\r\nld to find Ahura Mazda. With purity of mind and\nholiness of heart one can f=\r\nind Him in one=E2=80=99s own heart.\n\n\nPERSEVERE IN YOUR SEARCH FOR GOD\n\nSri=\r\n Ramakrishna -- There are pearls in the deep sea, but one must hazard all\nt=\r\no find them. If diving once does not bring you pearls, you need not\ntherefo=\r\nre conclude that the sea is without them. Dive again and again. You\nare sur=\r\ne to be rewarded in the end. So is it with the finding of the Lord in\nthis =\r\nworld. If your first attempt proves fruitless, do not lose heart.\nPersevere=\r\n in your efforts. You are sure to realize Him at last.\n\nHoly Mother -- Cont=\r\ninue to pray without losing heart. Everything will happen\nin time.\n\nSwami V=\r\nivekananda -- To succeed, you must have tremendous perseverance,\ntremendous=\r\n will. &quot;I will drink the ocean,&quot; says the persevering soul, &quot;at my\nwill mou=\r\nntains will crumble up.&quot; Have that sort of energy, that sort of\nwill, work =\r\nhard, and you will reach the goal.\n\nBuddha -- Search with sincerity and per=\r\nsevere in your search. In the end you\nwill find the Truth.\n\nGuru Nanak -- D=\r\nwell on Him day after day, That thou mergest imperceptibly in\nHis Name.\n\nJe=\r\nsus Christ -- And he told them a parable, to the effect that they ought\nalw=\r\nays to pray and not lose heart. He said, &quot;In a certain city there was a\njud=\r\nge who neither feared God nor regarded man; and there was a widow in that\nc=\r\nity who kept coming to him and saying, =E2=80=98Vindicate me against my adv=\r\nersary.=E2=80=99\nFor a while he refused; but afterward he said to himself, =\r\n=E2=80=98Though I neither\nfear God nor regard man, yet because the widow bo=\r\nthers me, I will vindicate\nher, or she will wear me out by her continual co=\r\nming=E2=80=99.&quot;\n\nJudaism -- Blessed is the man who walks not in the counsel=\r\n of the wicked,\nnor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the seat of s=\r\ncoffers; but his\ndelight is the law of the Lord, and on his law he meditate=\r\ns day and night.\nHe is like a tree planted by streams of water, that yields=\r\n its fruit in its\nseason, and its leaf does not wither. In all that he does=\r\n, he prospers.\n\nKrishna -- I am easy of access to that ever steadfast yogi =\r\nwho, O Partha,\nconstantly meditates on Me and gives no thought to anything =\r\nelse.\n\nMohammed -- Seek knowledge from the cradle to the grave.\n\nNative Ame=\r\nrican -- It may be that we shall receive no vision or message from\nthe Grea=\r\nt Spirit the first time that we lament [cry for a vision], yet we\nmay try m=\r\nany times, for we should remember that Wakan-Tanka is always\nanxious to aid=\r\n those who seek Him with a pure heart. But of course much\ndepends on the na=\r\nture of the person who cries for a vision, and upon the\ndegree to which he =\r\nhas purified and prepared himself.\n\nRama -- Keeping company with My devotee=\r\ns, always serving Me and My Bhaktas,\nfasting on Ekadasi, celebrating the fe=\r\nstivals connected with Me, hearing,\nreading and expounding My glories, wors=\r\nhipping Me with continuous devotion,\nand singing of My excellences: If one =\r\nfollows these precepts daily, one gets\npure devotion.\n\nSankara -- The Atman=\r\n that is Absolute Existence and Knowledge, can not be\nrealized without cons=\r\ntant practice. So one seeking Knowledge should meditate\nupon Brahman for th=\r\ne attainment of the desired goal.\n\nVedas -- This Atman, resplendent and pur=\r\ne, whom the sinless sannyasins\nbehold residing within the body, is attained=\r\n by unceasing practice of\ntruthfulness, austerity, right knowledge, and con=\r\ntinence.\n\nZoroaster -- Exert ceaselessly for the Glory of Ahura Mazda and f=\r\nor the good\nof the Universe.\n\n\nTRUST COMPLETELY IN GOD\n\nSri Ramakrishna -- =\r\nWhat are you to do when you are placed in the world? Give\nup everything to =\r\nHim, resign yourself to Him, and there will be no more\ntrouble for you. The=\r\nn you will come to know that everything is done by His\nwill.\n\nHoly Mother -=\r\n- If anyone surrenders himself totally at his feet, the Master\nwill see tha=\r\nt everything is set right.\n\nSwami Vivekananda -- Stand up for God; let the =\r\nworld go.\n\nBuddha -- Surrender the grasping disposition of your selfishness=\r\n, and you\nwill attain to that sinless calm state of mind which conveys perf=\r\nect peace,\ngoodness, and wisdom.\n\nGuru Nanak -- He who gives himself up to =\r\nHis supreme will, wins the goal. No\nother action counts in achieving this e=\r\nnd.\n\nJesus Christ -- Therefore do not be anxious, saying, =E2=80=98What sha=\r\nll we eat?=E2=80=99\nor, =E2=80=98What shall we drink?=E2=80=99 or, =E2=80=\r\n=98What shall we wear?=E2=80=99 For the Gentiles seek\nall these things; and=\r\n your heavenly Father knows that you need them all. But\nseek first his king=\r\ndom and his righteousness, and all these things shall be\nyours as well.\n\nJu=\r\ndaism -- The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want; he makes me lie down\nin=\r\n green pastures. He leads me beside still waters; he restores my soul. He\nl=\r\neads me in paths of righteousness for his names sake.\nEven though I walk th=\r\nrough the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no\nevil; for thou art with =\r\nme; thy rod and thy staff, they comfort me.\n\nKrishna -- Fixing your heart o=\r\nn Me, you will overcome every difficulty by My\ngrace; but if from self-conc=\r\neit you do not listen to Me, you shall perish\nutterly.\n\nMohammed -- If you =\r\nrely upon God as He ought to be relied upon, He will\nprovide you as He prov=\r\nides the birds: they go out empty and hungry in the\nmorning and come back b=\r\nig-bellied at eventide.\n\nNative American -- All things give thanks to You, =\r\nO Wakan-Tanka, who are\nmerciful, and who help us all. We ask all this of Yo=\r\nu because we know that\nYou are the only One, and that You have power over a=\r\nll things!\n\nRama -- Do not be overjoyed if you get a fortune, neither shoul=\r\nd you be\ndejected if you lose it. Your mind should be well balanced. I, Ram=\r\na, am the\nlife of all souls. Your mind should be fixed on Me alone.\n\nSankar=\r\na -- I know no Mantra, Yantra, or Stotra; I know no invocation or\ncontempla=\r\ntion; I know no stories in your praise; I know not Mudras, not even\nhow to =\r\ncry out; I simply know that to run to you, Mother, destroys all\ndistress.\n\n=\r\nVedas -- Children pursue outer pleasures and fall into the net of widesprea=\r\nd\ndeath; but calm souls, having known what is unshakable Immortality, do no=\r\nt\ncovet any uncertain thing in this world.\n\nZoroaster -- Trust in God and d=\r\no the Right.\n\n\nLOVE OF GOD IS ESSENTIAL\n\nSri Ramakrishna -- Unalloyed love =\r\nof God is the essential thing. All else is\nunreal.\n\nHoly Mother -- One=E2=\r\n=80=99s love of God depends entirely upon one=E2=80=99s inner feelings.\nLov=\r\ne of God is the essential thing.\n\nSwami Vivekananda -- Giving up all other =\r\nthoughts, with the whole mind day\nand night worship God. Thus being worship=\r\nped day and night, He reveals\nhimself and makes His worshippers feel His pr=\r\nesence.\n\nBuddha -- That which is most needed is a loving heart.\n\nGuru Nanak=\r\n -- God is not pleased by obstinate penance nor by many religious\ngarbs. He=\r\n who fashioned the vessel of the body and poured into it, His\nambrosial gif=\r\nts, will only be satisfied with man=E2=80=99s love and service.\n\nJesus Chri=\r\nst -- &quot;Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?&quot; And he\nsaid to =\r\nhim, &quot;You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, and with\nall yo=\r\nur soul, and with all your mind. This is the great and first\ncommandment.&quot;\n=\r\n\nJudaism -- Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one; and you shal=\r\nl\nlove the Lord your God with all your heart, and with all your soul, and w=\r\nith\nall your might.\n\nKrishna -- But the great-souled men, O Partha, who are=\r\n endowed with the\ndivine nature, worship Me with undisturbed minds, knowing=\r\n that I am\nimmutable and the origin of all beings. Ever glorifying Me, alwa=\r\nys striving\nwith self-control, remaining firm in their vows, bowing before =\r\nMe, they\nworship Me with love and unwavering steadiness.\n\nMohammed -- Whoev=\r\ner loves to meet God, God loves to meet him.\n\nNative American -- Wakan-Tank=\r\na, help us to walk the sacred path of life\nwithout difficulty, with our min=\r\nds and hearts continually fixed on You!\n\nRama -- Devotion is the only thing=\r\n that is essential to worship Me. It is\nimpossible for a person to see Me b=\r\ny the merit of sacrifice, austerity,\ncharity, or by the study of Vedas or b=\r\ny performing the scriptural rites, if\nhe is devoid of devotion to Me.\n\nSank=\r\nara -- Among things conducive to liberation, devotion alone holds the\nsupre=\r\nme place. The seeking after one=E2=80=99s real nature is designated as\ndevo=\r\ntion.\n\nVedas -- Under a golden brilliance the face of Truth lies hidden. Do=\r\n Thou, O\nProtector, withdraw this cover, that I, devoted to Truth alone, ma=\r\ny realize\nit.\n\nZoroaster -- As the Fire on the censer consumes sandalwood s=\r\no let the Fire\nburning within you consume your heart with love for Ahura Ma=\r\nzda.\n\n--- from ramakrishna.org\n\nSource: http://www.arunachala-ramana.org/fo=\r\nrum/index.php?topic=3D6250.msg0\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=\r\n=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=\r\n=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=\r\n=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--0016e6541bb89e671e04acb7188e\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;SEE GOD IN ALL&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sr=\r\ni Ramakrishna -- I have now come to a stage of realization in which I see t=\r\nhat God is walking in every human form and manifesting Himself alike throug=\r\nh the sage and the sinner, the virtuous and the vicious.

In the fullness of one=E2=80=99s spiritual =\r\nrealization one will find that He who resides in one=E2=80=99s heart, resid=\r\nes in the hearts of others as well - the oppressed, the persecuted, the unt=\r\nouchable, and the outcast.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Swami Vivekananda -- It is impossible t=\r\no find God outside of ourselves. Our own souls contribute all of the divini=\r\nty that is outside of us. We are the greatest temple. The objectification i=\r\ns only a faint imitation of what we see within ourselves.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Buddha -=\r\n- The subject on which I meditate is truth. The practice to which I devote =\r\nmyself is the truth. The topic of my conversation is truth. My thoughts are=\r\n always in truth.

This is the real Peace, and the others are but reflections of=\r\n this. The second peace is that which is made between two individuals, and =\r\nthe third is that which is made between two nations. But above all you shou=\r\nld understand that there can never be peace between nations until there is =\r\nfirst known that true peace which, as I have often said, is within the soul=\r\ns of men.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Rama -- Think that you =\r\nare Parabrahman, you have no attachment, you are all-knowing and you are pu=\r\nre.

If diving once does not bring you pearls, you need not theref=\r\nore conclude that the sea is without them. Dive again and again. You are su=\r\nre to be rewarded in the end. So is it with the finding of the Lord in this=\r\n world. If your first attempt proves fruitless, do not lose heart. Persever=\r\ne in your efforts. You are sure to realize Him at last.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Hol=\r\ny Mother -- Continue to pray without losing heart. Everything will happen i=\r\nn time.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Swami Vivekananda -- To succeed, you must have tremendous pe=\r\nrseverance, tremendous will. &quot;I will drink the ocean,&quot; says the p=\r\nersevering soul, &quot;at my will mountains will crumble up.&quot; Have tha=\r\nt sort of energy, that sort of will, work hard, and you will reach the goal=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Buddha -- Search with sincerity and persevere in your search.

He said, &quot;In a certain city there was a judge who n=\r\neither feared God nor regarded man; and there was a widow in that city who =\r\nkept coming to him and saying, =E2=80=98Vindicate me against my adversary.=\r\n=E2=80=99 For a while he refused; but afterward he said to himself, =E2=80=\r\n=98Though I neither fear God nor regard man, yet because the widow bothers =\r\nme, I will vindicate her, or she will wear me out by her continual coming=\r\n=E2=80=99.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Judaism -- Blessed is the man who walks not in th=\r\ne counsel of the wicked, nor stands in the way of sinners, nor sits in the =\r\nseat of scoffers; but his delight is the law of the Lord, and on his law he=\r\n meditates day and night. He is like a tree planted by streams of water, th=\r\nat yields its fruit in its season, and its leaf does not wither. In all tha=\r\nt he does, he prospers.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Krishna -- I am easy of access to that eve=\r\nr steadfast yogi who, O Partha, constantly meditates on Me and gives no tho=\r\nught to anything else.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mohammed -- Seek knowledge from the cradle to=\r\n the grave.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Native American -- It may be that we shall receive no vi=\r\nsion or message from the Great Spirit the first time that we lament [cry fo=\r\nr a vision], yet we may try many times, for we should remember that Wakan-T=\r\nanka is always anxious to aid those who seek Him with a pure heart. But of =\r\ncourse much depends on the nature of the person who cries for a vision, and=\r\n upon the degree to which he has purified and prepared himself.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Ra=\r\nma -- Keeping company with My devotees, always serving Me and My Bhaktas, f=\r\nasting on Ekadasi, celebrating the festivals connected with Me, hearing, re=\r\nading and expounding My glories, worshipping Me with continuous devotion, a=\r\nnd singing of My excellences: If one follows these precepts daily, one gets=\r\n pure devotion.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Sankara -- The Atman that is Absolute Existence an=\r\nd Knowledge, can not be realized without constant practice.

No other action counts in achieving this end.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Jesus Christ=\r\n -- Therefore do not be anxious, saying, =E2=80=98What shall we eat?=E2=80=\r\n=99 or, =E2=80=98What shall we drink?=E2=80=99 or, =E2=80=98What shall we w=\r\near?=E2=80=99 For the Gentiles seek all these things; and your heavenly Fat=\r\nher knows that you need them all. But seek first his kingdom and his righte=\r\nousness, and all these things shall be yours as well.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Judaism -- T=\r\nhe Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want; he makes me lie down in green pas=\r\ntures.

Love of God is the essential thing.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Swami Vivekananda -- Givi=\r\nng up all other thoughts, with the whole mind day and night worship God.
