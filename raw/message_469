If you do not know the \n\nright deity, just doin=\r\ng some sadhana is definitely better than waiting. Pick \n\nwhatever deity see=\r\nms natural to you and do sadhana.\n\n\n\nPlease remember that sadhana for spiri=\r\ntual progress is different from \n\nsadhana for specific material benefits. N=\r\no matter which deity you worship, \n\nsadhana performed for spiritual progres=\r\ns never goes waste. However, \n\nsometimes it may be necessary to experience =\r\nthe results of some bad karmas \n\nbefore some good things happen. Imagine al=\r\nl your karmas lying in a pile in a \n\nbasket. Suppose some of the really goo=\r\nd karmas that will enable you to do \n\nserious sadhana and experience great =\r\nthings lie at the bottom or middle of \n\nthe pile. When you start sadhana, s=\r\nuppose god decides to give you the fruits \n\nof those auspicious karmas. Ima=\r\ngine him reaching into the pile and \n\nretrieving those karmas. In the proce=\r\nss, some other karmas may spill over \n\nand give their fruits. Some of those=\r\n may be undesirable. So what? They had \n\nto be experienced sometime or the =\r\nother, anyway!\n\n\n\nA serious sadhaka should never be disheartened by a few s=\r\neemingly \n\nundesirable results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just kee=\r\np going.\n\n\n\nOne gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a very good=\r\n \n\npriest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few days, he=\r\n was \n\nlaid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He continued his sa=\r\ndhana \n\nand used the break to go on an extended trip to India and make a pi=\r\nlgrimage \n\nto some nice places. He participated in the Shata Chandi homam w=\r\ne conducted \n\nat the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He met my=\r\n guru and got \n\nthe opportunity to be his room mate for a week when we stay=\r\ned at the house \n\nof a priest during the homam. He could observe and intera=\r\nct with my guru \n\nvery closely. Most importantly, when my guru had a vision=\r\n of the Mother on \n\n2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She told him to start =\r\nthe work on spreading \n\nhomam in the world, this gentleman was present ther=\r\ne. Though he could not \n\nsee the Mother, he actually smelled something out =\r\nof the world and was \n\nbaffled. He knew something was going on, but did not=\r\n know what. The temple \n\nwas closed at the time and my guru and this gentle=\r\nmen were the only people \n\non the premises when the Mother appeared. Even t=\r\nhough he could not see the \n\nMother, it was most fortunate of him to be pre=\r\nsent there at *that* crucial \n\nmoment. That is enough to mould the rest of =\r\nhis life.\n\n\n\nYou never know how, when and where the grace of god falls on y=\r\nou. \n\nCalculations and logic are useless when it comes to the grace of god.=\r\n Just \n\nsurrender and keep doing whatever sadhana you picked. If it needs \n=\r\n\nfine-tuning, somebody will appear to tell you that. Any bad things that \n\n=\r\nhappen when doing a spiritual sadhana should be viewed as nature settling \n=\r\n\nsome debts so that you are prepared to receive the fruits of some really \n=\r\n\nauspicious karmas.\n\n\n\nAs Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have &quot;sraddha an=\r\nd saburi&quot;. Have devotion \n\nand patience. There is no limit to what you can =\r\nget then.\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nNarasimha\n\n------------ --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- -\n\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAs=\r\nt rologer.org/ homam\n\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rolog=\r\ner.org/ tarpana\n\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdo=\r\nm\n\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n\nFree J=\r\nyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n\nSri Jagannath C=\r\nentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n\n------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n\n\n----- Original Message ----- \n=\r\n\n&gt; Namaste Sir\n\n&gt; what you said makes a lot sense and it was marvellous\n\n&gt; =\r\nbut i have some small doubts\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; Leaving astrology aside and those who do=\r\n not have a guru\n\n&gt; how can they chooose a particular form of GOD\n\n&gt; bcoz i=\r\nn second part of AGHORA, Vimalanda, said choosing right deity\n\n&gt; is very im=\r\nportant, as the analogy he gave of a person\n\n&gt; who is greedy and worships L=\r\nAKSHMI , may increase his greed\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; One thing more\n\n&gt; we have so many dei=\r\nties  that on diwali i would like to worship\n\n&gt; Lakshmi and Kali\n\n&gt; in nava=\r\nratri (nowadays) we would worship Durga\n\n&gt; on janmashtami we would fast for=\r\n KRISHNA\n\n&gt; an on MAHASHIVARATRI for SHIVA\n\n&gt; like this\n\n&gt; with hte change =\r\nin festival the deity changes\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; though everybody knows GOD is ONE but i=\r\nt becomes difficult to get\n\n&gt; out of this\n\n&gt; mould and if i didnt worship h=\r\ner may be that GOD/GODDESS may become\n\n&gt; angry\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; I Know,this is my fool=\r\nishness but stiil this thing hangs in the mind\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; One thing more\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; S=\r\nuppose if i choose a deity and something wrong happens\n\n&gt; (materiallistical=\r\nly )\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; what should i consider that my deity was helping me to clear my\n=\r\n\n&gt; DEBTS/WRONG DEEDS\n\n&gt; or the NATURE was telling me to change the DEITY as=\r\n I  am not fit\n\n&gt; for that DEITY\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; and sometimes you feel\n\n&gt; o what am =\r\ni doing does this really works\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; and one thing more\n\n&gt;\n\n&gt; what if we go=\r\n on doing our pooja and someday\n\n&gt; something like what happened to Pt.

I will\n\n&gt; continue in\n\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nthe same vein for a little more time.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; I had a dream a couple of yea=\r\nrs ago early in the morning. In the\n\n&gt; dream,\n\n&gt;&gt; there was a big ritual fi=\r\nre. My guru Manish Pandit and I were\n\n&gt; sitting in\n\n&gt;&gt; front of the fire. H=\r\ne was teaching me some pranayama techniques in\n\n&gt; the\n\n&gt;&gt; dream. Suddenly, =\r\nhe changed into somebody else that I could not\n\n&gt; recognize.\n\n&gt;&gt; It was not=\r\n anybody I had seen before.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; I mentioned this dream to my guru after=\r\n a couple of weeks. First\n\n&gt; he said he\n\n&gt;&gt; did not know who the other pers=\r\non was and said he would&#39;ve\n\n&gt; probably known if\n\n&gt;&gt; I had mentioned the dr=\r\neam soon after it had happened. I left it\n\n&gt; there.\n\n&gt;&gt; However, when we ta=\r\nlked in the next weekend, he referred to my\n\n&gt; dream and\n\n&gt;&gt; said he had an=\r\n idea who it was. He gave me a name and asked me to\n\n&gt; search on\n\n&gt;&gt; the in=\r\nternet for his photo and see if he was the person I saw in\n\n&gt; my dream.\n\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n It was a guru from the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda (before\n\n&gt; him). T=\r\nhough\n\n&gt;&gt; he is apparently well-known, I was not knowledegable about this\n\n=\r\n&gt; lineage and\n\n&gt;&gt; did not see his picture before. I searched on the interne=\r\nt and\n\n&gt; found a\n\n&gt;&gt; photo. Interestingly, the photo was very close to the =\r\nperson I saw\n\n&gt; in my\n\n&gt;&gt; dream. The person that Manish transformed into in=\r\n my dream looked\n\n&gt; like a\n\n&gt;&gt; slightly younger version of that photo.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; When I confirmed this to Manish, he only smiled and\n\n&gt; said, &quot;Narasimha=\r\n, there\n\n&gt;&gt; are so many links between various lineages. Leave it for now.&quot;\n=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; Of course, I do not know much about kriya yoga or about the\n\n&gt; line=\r\nage of\n\n&gt;&gt; Paramahamsa Yogananda. Our lineage of this life starts from\n\n&gt; D=\r\nattatreya. We\n\n&gt;&gt; have a special attachment to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and =\r\nhis\n\n&gt; lineage and got\n\n&gt;&gt; a lot of our knowledge, inspiration and perhaps =\r\nexperience from\n\n&gt; them. We do\n\n&gt;&gt; not have any direct link to the lineage =\r\nof Paramahamsa Yogananda.\n\n&gt; But,\n\n&gt;&gt; Manish thought there were some other =\r\nindirect links. Moreover, he\n\n&gt; guessed\n\n&gt;&gt; who I saw, even though I myself=\r\n had no idea who I saw, and he\n\n&gt; guessed\n\n&gt;&gt; correctly. That should count =\r\nfor something!\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; I will not be surprised if there are indeed subtle c=\r\nonnections\n\n&gt; between\n\n&gt;&gt; several lineages that seem disjoint today.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; By the way, Swami Vivekananda also appeared in the prison cell of\n\n&gt; Sri\n=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; Aurobindo (who wrote brilliant commentaries on Veda and Upanishad)\n\n&gt; a=\r\nnd\n\n&gt;&gt; imparted him some Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; *     =\r\n   *        *\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; An interesting coincidence is that a swamiji from Pur=\r\ni contacted\n\n&gt; me within a\n\n&gt;&gt; few days after I saw that photo. His guru an=\r\nd Paramahamsa\n\n&gt; Yogananda were\n\n&gt;&gt; co-disciples of the same guru (Yukteshw=\r\nar Maharaj). He is the\n\n&gt; keeper of\n\n&gt;&gt; some astrological knowledge that hi=\r\ns guru received from Yukteshwar\n\n&gt; Maharaj.\n\n&gt;&gt; He visited me after a month=\r\n, discussed that knowledge and spent a\n\n&gt; day at my\n\n&gt;&gt; house. Thus, some s=\r\nmall connection was made with a representative\n\n&gt; of that\n\n&gt;&gt; lineage soon =\r\nafter the dream. After all, some karmik debts may\n\n&gt; have been\n\n&gt;&gt; there...=\r\n\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; I want to make one thing clear.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; Some things I mention like this may give the impression that my\n\n&gt; guru h=\r\nas\n\n&gt;&gt; some psychic abilities or siddhis. That may indeed be true. But he\n\n=\r\n&gt; always\n\n&gt;&gt; downplays those things and attaches no importance whatsoever. =\r\nHe\n\n&gt; says,\n\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I am a useless person and lower than dirt and c=\r\napable\n\n&gt; of\n\n&gt;&gt; nothing. It is all Her power. She is the connection betwee=\r\nn every\n\n&gt; entity in\n\n&gt;&gt; this universe. She may choose an idiot like me as =\r\nan instrument\n\n&gt; sometimes\n\n&gt;&gt; and do something using me. I have no special=\r\n abilities of any\n\n&gt; kind. Any\n\n&gt;&gt; coincidences you find are just Her grace=\r\n and not due to me.&quot;\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; I realized in time that this simplicity, humil=\r\nity and lack of ego\n\n&gt; is not\n\n&gt;&gt; fake. I also realized that this lack of e=\r\ngo is what enabled him to\n\n&gt; do things\n\n&gt;&gt; that sound impossible or difficu=\r\nlt. In fact, I realized that many\n\n&gt; great\n\n&gt;&gt; saints in the past were like=\r\n this. Several magical things happened\n\n&gt; through\n\n&gt;&gt; them, but they did no=\r\nt find any pride in them and retained their\n\n&gt; humility\n\n&gt;&gt; and sense of su=\r\nrrender to their chosen form of god and believed\n\n&gt; that god\n\n&gt;&gt; was the do=\r\ner of all things and they were mere instruments.\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; The day you also s=\r\ntart believing that, not for the sake of\n\n&gt; lecturing or\n\n&gt;&gt; posturing, but=\r\n from the deep cores of your heart, your sadhana\n\n&gt; will bear\n\n&gt;&gt; fruit.\n\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n\n&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- -\n\n&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAst rologer.org/ homam\n\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst =\r\nrologer.org/ tarpana\n\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedi=\r\nc- wisdom\n\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. =\r\nnet\n\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n\n&gt;&gt; ----=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; -----=\r\n Original Message ----- \n\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;=\r\nvedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, September 29, 2008 5:54 P=\r\nM\n\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Yogananda (Re: Dharma)\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt;\n\n&gt;&gt; --- In ved=\r\nic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

If you do not know the &lt;br&gt;\nright d=\r\neity, just doing some sadhana is definitely better than waiting. Pick &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\nwhatever deity seems natural to you and do sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPlease remembe=\r\nr that sadhana for spiritual progress is different from &lt;br&gt;\nsadhana for sp=\r\necific material benefits. No matter which deity you worship, &lt;br&gt;\nsadhana p=\r\nerformed for spiritual progress never goes waste. However, &lt;br&gt;\nsometimes i=\r\nt may be necessary to experience the results of some bad karmas &lt;br&gt;\nbefore=\r\n some good things happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in a pile in a &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nbasket. Suppose some of the really good karmas that will enable you to do =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nserious sadhana and experience great things lie at the bottom or middl=\r\ne of &lt;br&gt;\nthe pile. When you start sadhana, suppose god decides to give you=\r\n the fruits &lt;br&gt;\nof those auspicious karmas. Imagine him reaching into the =\r\npile and &lt;br&gt;\nretrieving those karmas. In the process, some other karmas ma=\r\ny spill over &lt;br&gt;\nand give their fruits. Some of those may be undesirable. =\r\nSo what? They had &lt;br&gt;\nto be experienced sometime or the other, anyway!&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nA serious sadhaka should never be disheartened by a few seemingly &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nundesirable results after starting a spiritual sadhana. Just keep going.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nOne gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a very good &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\npriest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few days, he=\r\n was &lt;br&gt;\nlaid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He continued his=\r\n sadhana &lt;br&gt;\nand used the break to go on an extended trip to India and mak=\r\ne a pilgrimage &lt;br&gt;\nto some nice places. He participated in the Shata Chand=\r\ni homam we conducted &lt;br&gt;\nat the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 200=\r\n6. He met my guru and got &lt;br&gt;\nthe opportunity to be his room mate for a we=\r\nek when we stayed at the house &lt;br&gt;\nof a priest during the homam. He could =\r\nobserve and interact with my guru &lt;br&gt;\nvery closely. Most importantly, when=\r\n my guru had a vision of the Mother on &lt;br&gt;\n2006 March 3 afternoon, in whic=\r\nh She told him to start the work on spreading &lt;br&gt;\nhomam in the world, this=\r\n gentleman was present there. Though he could not &lt;br&gt;\nsee the Mother, he a=\r\nctually smelled something out of the world and was &lt;br&gt;\nbaffled. He knew so=\r\nmething was going on, but did not know what. The temple &lt;br&gt;\nwas closed at =\r\nthe time and my guru and this gentlemen were the only people &lt;br&gt;\non the pr=\r\nemises when the Mother appeared. Even though he could not see the &lt;br&gt;\nMoth=\r\ner, it was most fortunate of him to be present there at *that* crucial &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nmoment. That is enough to mould the rest of his life.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nYou never k=\r\nnow how, when and where the grace of god falls on you. &lt;br&gt;\nCalculations an=\r\nd logic are useless when it comes to the grace of god. Just &lt;br&gt;\nsurrender =\r\nand keep doing whatever sadhana you picked. If it needs &lt;br&gt;\nfine-tuning, s=\r\nomebody will appear to tell you that. Any bad things that &lt;br&gt;\nhappen when =\r\ndoing a spiritual sadhana should be viewed as nature settling &lt;br&gt;\nsome deb=\r\nts so that you are prepared to receive the fruits of some really &lt;br&gt;\nauspi=\r\ncious karmas.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nAs Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have &quot;sraddha an=\r\nd saburi&quot;. Have devotion &lt;br&gt;\nand patience. There is no limit to what you c=\r\nan get then.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBest regards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n------------ --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: =\r\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Y=\r\nourself: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nSpirit=\r\nuality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/=\r\na&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blan=\r\nk&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;=\r\n/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_=\r\nblank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/a=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n----- Original Message ----- &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sir&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; what you =\r\nsaid makes a lot sense and it was marvellous&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; but i have some small=\r\n doubts&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Leaving astrology aside and those who do not have=\r\n a guru&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; how can they chooose a particular form of GOD&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; bco=\r\nz in second part of AGHORA, Vimalanda, said choosing right deity&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; i=\r\ns very important, as the analogy he gave of a person&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; who is greedy=\r\n and worships LAKSHMI , may increase his greed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One thing =\r\nmore&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; we have so many deities  that on diwali i would like to worsh=\r\nip&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Lakshmi and Kali&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in navaratri (nowadays) we would wors=\r\nhip Durga&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; on janmashtami we would fast for KRISHNA&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; an on =\r\nMAHASHIVARATRI for SHIVA&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; like this&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; with hte change in fes=\r\ntival the deity changes&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; though everybody knows GOD is ONE=\r\n but it becomes difficult to get&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; out of this&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; mould and if=\r\n i didnt worship her may be that GOD/GODDESS may become&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; angry&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I Know,this is my foolishness but stiil this thing hangs in t=\r\nhe mind&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; One thing more&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Suppose if i cho=\r\nose a deity and something wrong happens&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; (materiallistically )&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; what should i consider that my deity was helping me to clear =\r\nmy&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; DEBTS/WRONG DEEDS&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; or the NATURE was telling me to chan=\r\nge the DEITY as I  am not fit&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; for that DEITY&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and=\r\n sometimes you feel&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; o what am i doing does this really works&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and one thing more&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; what if we go on doing ou=\r\nr pooja and someday&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; something like what happened to Pt.

In the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; dream,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; there was a big ritual fire. My guru Manish Pandit an=\r\nd I were&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sitting in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; front of the fire. He was teachin=\r\ng me some pranayama techniques in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; dream. Suddenly=\r\n, he changed into somebody else that I could not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; recognize.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt; It was not anybody I had seen before.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I me=\r\nntioned this dream to my guru after a couple of weeks. First&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; he sa=\r\nid he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; did not know who the other person was and said he would&#39;=\r\nve&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; probably known if&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I had mentioned the dream soon a=\r\nfter it had happened. I left it&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; there.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However, when =\r\nwe talked in the next weekend, he referred to my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; dream and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt; said he had an idea who it was. He gave me a name and asked me to&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; search on&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; the internet for his photo and see if he was t=\r\nhe person I saw in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; my dream.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; It was a guru from the l=\r\nineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda (before&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; him). Though&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\nhe is apparently well-known, I was not knowledegable about this&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; li=\r\nneage and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; did not see his picture before. I searched on the in=\r\nternet and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; found a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; photo. Interestingly, the photo wa=\r\ns very close to the person I saw&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; in my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; dream. The per=\r\nson that Manish transformed into in my dream looked&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; like a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n;&gt; slightly younger version of that photo.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Whe=\r\nn I confirmed this to Manish, he only smiled and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; said, &quot;Narasimha,=\r\n there&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; are so many links between various lineages. Leave it fo=\r\nr now.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Of course, I do not know much about kriya=\r\n yoga or about the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lineage of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Paramahamsa Yogananda. =\r\nOur lineage of this life starts from&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dattatreya. We&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; h=\r\nave a special attachment to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and his&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lineag=\r\ne and got&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; a lot of our knowledge, inspiration and perhaps expe=\r\nrience from&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; them. We do&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; not have any direct link to t=\r\nhe lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; But,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Manish thou=\r\nght there were some other indirect links. Moreover, he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; guessed&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; who I saw, even though I myself had no idea who I saw, and he&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; guessed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; correctly. That should count for something!&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I will not be surprised if there are indeed subtle co=\r\nnnections&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; between&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; several lineages that seem disjoint=\r\n today.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; By the way, Swami Vivekananda also appear=\r\ned in the prison cell of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sri&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Aurobindo (who wrote bri=\r\nlliant commentaries on Veda and Upanishad)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; impart=\r\ned him some Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *=\r\n        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; An interesting coincidence is =\r\nthat a swamiji from Puri contacted&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; me within a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; few da=\r\nys after I saw that photo. His guru and Paramahamsa&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Yogananda were=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; co-disciples of the same guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). He is the=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; keeper of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; some astrological knowledge that his guru =\r\nreceived from Yukteshwar&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Maharaj.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; He visited me after=\r\n a month, discussed that knowledge and spent a&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; day at my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt; house. Thus, some small connection was made with a representative&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; of that&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; lineage soon after the dream. After all, some karm=\r\nik debts may&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; have been&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; there...&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I want to make one thing=\r\n clear.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Some things I mention like this may give =\r\nthe impression that my&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; guru has&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; some psychic abilitie=\r\ns or siddhis. That may indeed be true. But he&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; always&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\ndownplays those things and attaches no importance whatsoever. He&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; s=\r\nays,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I am a useless person and lower than dirt and=\r\n capable&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; nothing. It is all Her power. She is the =\r\nconnection between every&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; entity in&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; this universe. She=\r\n may choose an idiot like me as an instrument&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; sometimes&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&g=\r\nt; and do something using me. I have no special abilities of any&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; k=\r\nind. Any&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; coincidences you find are just Her grace and not due =\r\nto me.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I realized in time that this simplicity, =\r\nhumility and lack of ego&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; is not&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; fake. I also realized=\r\n that this lack of ego is what enabled him to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; do things&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&g=\r\nt; that sound impossible or difficult. In fact, I realized that many&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; great&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; saints in the past were like this. Several magical th=\r\nings happened&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; through&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; them, but they did not find any=\r\n pride in them and retained their&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; humility&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and sense =\r\nof surrender to their chosen form of god and believed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; that god&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; was the doer of all things and they were mere instruments.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The day you also start believing that, not for the sake=\r\n of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; lecturing or&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; posturing, but from the deep cores o=\r\nf your heart, your sadhana&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; will bear&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; fruit.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --------=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Do a =\r\nShort Homam Yourself: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blan=\r\nk&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rolo=\r\nger.org/ tarpana&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://grou=\r\nps. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.c=\r\nomcast.net&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyot=\r\nish software (Windows): &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;=\r\nDinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow=\r\n&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Monday, September 29, 200=\r\n8 5:54 PM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Yogananda (Re: Dharma)&lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_bla=\r\nnk&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroup=\r\ns. com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.
