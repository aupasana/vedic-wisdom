Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Raj=\r\narshi,\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Very nice to hear from you!\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The &quot;unmistakeable&quot; link=\r\n to the *physical* evolution of life on earth does not imply an increasing =\r\nsequence of *spiritual* perfection, as you cannot directly map the physical=\r\n to the spiritual. More importantly, if your understanding is correct, why =\r\nisn&#39;t perfection occurring in the FINAL incarnation but occurring well befo=\r\nre?\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; First, =\r\nregarding Krishna being a &quot;poornavatara&quot;, SrimadBhagavatam (SB) does not sa=\r\ny that Rama is not one. In fact, Parasara, father of Vyasa, explicitly ment=\r\nioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha are &quot;poornavataras&quot;\n&gt;  (used=\r\n that exact expression) while other avataras have some amount of jivatmamsa=\r\n too (though paramatmamsa dominates jivatmamsa).\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Secondly, after de=\r\nscribing the avataras, SB says that there are in fact innumerable avataras =\r\nand that all rishis, munis, manus, demigods etc are avataras of Supreme Lor=\r\nd. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 then proceeds to say &quot;these avatara=\r\ns are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himself.&quot; I question if the deduction =\r\nthat Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and Rama is not is accurate! It only s=\r\neems to say that all these rishis, manus, demigods etc are partial. As I sa=\r\nid above, Pararsara explicitly said that both Rama and Krishna are poornava=\r\ntaras.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Third, let us ask a very fundamental question: What exactly =\r\ndoes it mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; While SB talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord =\r\nHimself&quot; in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of Supreme Lord, who is =\r\nin\n&gt;  reality formless (arUpa) and of the nature of pure consciousness (chi=\r\ndAtman), are manufactured by the qualities of Maya&quot;. In the next verse, it =\r\nfurther compares forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt in air. Just as sk=\r\ny *contains* clouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *contains* forms and=\r\n is beyond them. So, again, what is the meaning of a specific form that des=\r\ncended on earth being &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I am afraid people may be misinterpre=\r\nting this notion based on their fancies and conditioning..\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; All bein=\r\ngs are made up of paramatma (supreme/absolute being) and jivatma (living/re=\r\nlative being). The latter portion is dominant in us and is responsible for =\r\ndesires and rebirth. Great avataras descend from a higher portion of parama=\r\ntma. Very rarely avataras descend entirely from paramatma without ANY jivat=\r\nma portion. Rama and Krishna are specific examples given by Parasara.\n&gt; =A0=\r\n\n&gt; They are entirely divine, but they do not encapsulate the entire divinit=\r\ny!!!! After all,\n&gt;  &quot;entire divinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form ju=\r\nst as no cloud can contain the entire sky. They take part in the drama obey=\r\ning and executing the divine will but NOT altering it. This applies to Kris=\r\nhna as well as Rama.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =\r\n*\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do not\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His\n&gt; &gt; realization, t=\r\nhe one he advocated, is a static realization,\n&gt; &gt; an end in a void.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt;=\r\n First, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. =\r\nIf he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your co=\r\nncept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you =\r\ntheorize.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Secondly, as per Parasara,\n&gt;  Buddha corresponds to Mercu=\r\nry, who personifies logical mind and the spirit of investigation and compre=\r\nhension. Logical mind and its spirit of comprehension are inherently fallib=\r\nle. Even a perfected spirit of comprehension is not capable of grasping the=\r\n Absolute Reality completely, for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder=\r\n it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an attempt to comprehend! That is wh=\r\nat Buddha ended up doing. However, logical mind has a great appeal in the A=\r\nge of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spi=\r\nritual force in this world in this age.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; If you dismiss Parasara&#39;s linking of planets t=\r\no avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely sure that the verse=\r\ns of SB you are relying on are perfect? (In any case, it&#39;s a different matt=\r\ner that you are only taking some SB verses and ignoring some as I showed!.)=\r\n\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The bottomline as far as I am concerned is that Pararsara&#39;s list a=\r\nctually makes amazingly coherent esoteric sense. The nature of each aspect =\r\nof consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit of=\r\n patience & persistence, Venus - spirit of happiness etc) and the story of\n=\r\n&gt;  corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meaningful connection, esoteric=\r\nally speaking. After all, esoterically is how you really need to understand=\r\n any higher scriptures and notions in them.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; If we take scriptures l=\r\niterally instead and draw lopsided conclusions, some would conclude that Sh=\r\niva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would concl=\r\nude that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and s=\r\no on.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; On a =\r\ndifferent note, someone may think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior to T=\r\nara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declared them to be es=\r\nsentially the same and some scriptures even prohibited differentiating betw=\r\neen them. As I see it, the difference between them is too subtle for even r=\r\nishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing\n&gt;  some significant difference b=\r\netween them are, I am afraid, merely projecting their own conditioning. Sam=\r\ne in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were=A0 perfectly detached and full=\r\ny divine karma yogis.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; If we think about it, perfected mind (paramat=\r\nma aspect represented by Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect represented by Su=\r\nn) are not really that different. So I am afraid Krishna and Rama are not t=\r\nhat different, though the specifics of their stories may be different.\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; One last word though. If someone truly believes that Krishna is super=\r\nior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I am very happy for such=\r\n a person. My arguments are more for the sake of sharing thinking/knowledge=\r\n and pushing the boundaries of understanding in the long run, than changing=\r\n the minds of anyone in the short run. In the end, everyone of us will have=\r\n to go through one&#39;s own cycles of various tamasik, rajasik and saattwik st=\r\nages of evolution before one starts grasping some fistfuls of Reality. Thes=\r\ne concepts are too subtle for anyone to convince others or be absolutely co=\r\nnfident oneself!\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Krishnarpanamastu,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrol=\r\nogy & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;r=\r\najarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com&gt; \n&gt; &gt;Sent: Saturday, May 4, 2013 7:34 AM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Comparing Dasavataras!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=A0 \n&gt; &gt;Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Jai=\r\n Ma!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I have a different view point. Let me write down as I s=\r\nee it, in point by point manner.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;1. In the Bhagwata Purana, ther=\r\ne are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara i=\r\ns the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayan=\r\na,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes o=\r\nntu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, =\r\nVyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the Supr=\r\neme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;2. Of these various=\r\n possible Avataras, 10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded sp=\r\necial mention and significance across various Hindu spiritual literature, s=\r\npecially those which were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[Wh=\r\nen Krshna was alive, it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtail=\r\ned the full effect of Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow=\r\n. All Puranas were composed after this, hence these are scriptures of the K=\r\nali-Yuga, as are Tantras]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed se=\r\nquence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama=\r\n, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of=\r\n the form and sequence of these main avatars with the evolution of life on =\r\nearth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-=\r\nanimal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form who immediately ta=\r\nkes possession of this earth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajas=\r\nhik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Av=\r\natara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that =\r\nspirituality is not to be separated into another world, but is a progressiv=\r\ne realization of the various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent=\r\n in the consciousness and its development through various life-forms. Large=\r\nr spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s gra=\r\nnd design for life on earth.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;4. In this specifc context, I am on=\r\nly focusing on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my content=\r\nion that if one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state=\r\n of liberation of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hind=\r\nuism, any Devata can lead a person to any depth of realization. And each on=\r\ne of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be co=\r\nnsider super-massive spiritual dynamos.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=A05. Of these, natu=\r\nrally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they represent a stage of ev=\r\nolution, both inside as well as outside, which society can relate of much e=\r\nasier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind.=\r\n A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to transform the anima=\r\nl tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a=\r\n greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can b=\r\ne instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and =\r\nwill change only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayan=\r\na, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did ha=\r\nve a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled b=\r\ny Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end=\r\n of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that=\r\n he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it was\n&gt;  the Dharma to do so, and=\r\n to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma of that age when he l=\r\nived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to =\r\nthe genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as a =\r\nscribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferences to it=\r\n anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated =\r\ninto his killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, suc=\r\nh that no personal consideration or emotions or passions can overturn the R=\r\najadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader must be!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Krshn=\r\na, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking h=\r\nis=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singular and constant deta=\r\nchment from situations, from people, from environment,\n&gt;  from circumstance=\r\ns that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana f=\r\nor Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents, his village-folks who so l=\r\noved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for him to leave the=\r\n shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village life and head into=\r\n an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then=\r\n he understood that they won&#39;t understand, he promised he will return back =\r\nonce his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, whe=\r\nn the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their dance, he oblige=\r\nd. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and possessive of Kr=\r\nshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to =\r\neveryone equally and no one has any special right over him. When Shishupala=\r\n abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smilin=\r\ng and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was\n&gt;  over, he swiftly cut off =\r\nShishupala&#39;s head and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairl=\r\ny accused Krshna of being a revolutionist and charlatan, Krshna did not kil=\r\nl him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black magici=\r\nan, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly =\r\nof kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he wa=\r\ns back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there on=\r\ne instance of his going overboard, never a single shade of depression, equi=\r\nvocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what others=\r\n say or think of him. And then right in the middle of the greatest war he h=\r\nad the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. =\r\nThat is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma=\r\n-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the ac=\r\ntion nor the results belong to the\n&gt;  instrument. When running away from th=\r\ne battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear a=\r\npart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or =\r\ngetting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, k=\r\nnew exactly how the situations must be lined up which would cause the destr=\r\nuction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational =\r\nthinking. But happens when one is constantly and consciously connected to t=\r\nhe Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situations in the =\r\nRama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the A=\r\ndhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a diffe=\r\nrent picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking=\r\n Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demol=\r\nishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the =\r\nRamayana and the Mahabharata,\n&gt;  the picture that emerges is very clear. Ra=\r\nma is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great c=\r\nharacteristics of satwa, chief of which is self-control, as well as the occ=\r\nasional sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least =\r\nuntil Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true=\r\n saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna =\r\nwas gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this world - man, women, =\r\ndeva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affected any trace=\r\n of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the most trying sit=\r\nuations.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But I do=\r\n not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, th=\r\ne one he advocated, is a static realization, an end in a void. This is clea=\r\nrly denying of the reality of this earth. I find this not in tune with what=\r\n either Rama or Krshna\n&gt;  espoused. None of them negated this world. If neg=\r\nation of this world and life is the final aim, then why send so many avatar=\r\ns at crucial stages of evolutionary development? If the spiritual impact on=\r\n masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zo=\r\nrathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But do they fit in th=\r\ne scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a =\r\nmost logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in parts of Indi=\r\na, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and=\r\n holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of life as well as insi=\r\nde of life. That is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual phil=\r\nosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence=\r\n and realization.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;7. The original literature of the Nath Yogis used =\r\nto mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological functions. 6 insid=\r\ne the human body\n&gt;  and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most people, even=\r\n seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - =\r\ncorrespond to the full power and force of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly=\r\n, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or allow the conscio=\r\nusness to explore and express itself is various possiblities, are 9 in numb=\r\ner. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore the chief Ava=\r\ntars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in number. And the nin=\r\nth of the sequence is yet to come.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;8. I cannot comment on which grah=\r\na would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says, ho=\r\nwever, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one cannot rule =\r\nout some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual misrepresentati=\r\non in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not yet appea=\r\nred. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora books, =\r\nNishkalanka\n&gt;  - the stainless one. There is only one thing which is perfec=\r\ntly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in =\r\nthe full and complete purity and might and force and strength of the Atmah.=\r\n By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away opposing f=\r\norces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna used =\r\ndiplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I=\r\n am speculating, won&#39;t even need that. The white horse and that sword is a =\r\nmetaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify the various err=\r\nors and corruptions that beset our age. \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Well, this is how I look at=\r\n the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but =\r\nI am reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;-=\r\nRegards\n&gt; &gt;=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmab=\r\nuddhayah |\n&gt; &gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

A learned=\r\n friend wrote that &quot;Krshna is the God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous Avatars are a build-u=\r\np to this stage&quot; and &quot;Buddha after Krshna is like going back from the linea=\r\nr progression of spirituality that the Avatars manifest one after the other=\r\n upto Krshna&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;I want to emphatically disagree with this notion t=\r\nhat Dasavatars of a &quot;linear progression of spirituality..upto Krshna&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;Each avata=\r\nra represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfected form.\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;Maharshi =\r\nParasara equated dasavataras with planets. For example, Rama, Krishna and\n&gt;=\r\n  Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively.\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;We also\n&gt;  know=\r\n that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, Saturn, Rahu and Ketu are p=\r\nersonifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/drive, learning spirit, wi=\r\nsdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being happy, patience/discipline, =\r\nspirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detachment (respectively).\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;Correspondingly, each avatara is an expression of that aspect of Sup=\r\nreme in a perfected form. Each story is an example of how that aspect opera=\r\ntes.\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;Lord Rama&#39;s story is a perfected example of how soul operate=\r\ns. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected example of how mind operates. Lord V=\r\namana&#39;s story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discrimination operates.=\r\n Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a perfected example of how energy/drive/initiati=\r\nve operates.\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, energy=\r\n in us,\n&gt;  learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline=\r\n/patience in us - all these are different manifestations of the same Self. =\r\nHowever, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has different q=\r\nualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;We MAY focus on one aspect of us first, perfect it and then perfect=\r\n other aspects through it. But, we need balance between all aspects in the =\r\nend. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable a=\r\nnd are in a balance working together in the Cosmos.\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;One who is fascinated by the q=\r\nualities of soul may like the story that demonstrates how soul operates; on=\r\ne who is fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the story that demons=\r\ntrates how mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the qualities of wis=\r\ndom may like the story that\n&gt;  demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on.=\r\n But this is just a matter of taste and subjective preference.\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;Let us focus on Ra=\r\nma and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a representative of god=\r\n in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It is the higher self and h=\r\nas no agendas, no likes or dislikes.\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;Once mind fancies a separate=\r\n existence with some agendas/desires, soul supports the individualized cons=\r\nciousness stemming from that fancy and sees it as its dharma. It lends stre=\r\nngth and support to EVERY aspect of this individualized consciousness (e.g.=\r\n mind, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyment, discipline etc). It =\r\nsupports them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its ow=\r\nn! It impassionately witnesses and records all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas =\r\nso that Laws of Nature give proper fruits later\n&gt;  on. It does all that des=\r\npite full awareness that it is neither doing those karmas nor receiving the=\r\n fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individualized consciousness ente=\r\nrtain the notion that they are doing things and begetting the fruits, soul =\r\nsupports them fully in this play. It sees that as its dharma and does it im=\r\npassionately.\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;Now, does this sound exciting? Perhaps not to all. =\r\nThis functionality of an impassionate witness supporting the play, may not =\r\nseem interesting enough to some.\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;On the other hand, mind has like=\r\ns, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursuing those agendas, getting t=\r\nhings and achieving things. Movement of mind is what keeps the individualiz=\r\nation going!!! Though soul is the support for everything else in the indivi=\r\ndualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing its dharma impassionately. =\r\nIt is mind that keeps the individualization going and brings in agendas and=\r\n passion and even decides/affects\n&gt;  every entity&#39;s dharma. That way, mind =\r\nis really the &quot;boss&quot; of the individualization. No wonder Krishna&#39;s life app=\r\neals more to one who may be excited by this description!\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;Lord Krishna is obviousl=\r\ny awe-inspiring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in perspective.\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;Rama&#39;=\r\ns life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma J=\r\nnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was his &quot;dhar=\r\nma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given kingdom. At t=\r\nhe last moment, his father banished him to forest at the behest of his step=\r\n-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had no complaints. Th=\r\nough his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty to various degree=\r\ns, he himself supported and consoled all three and followed his dharma impa=\r\nssionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest\n&gt;  with Lakshmana and=\r\n going after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately=\r\n when Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her =\r\nand fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her o=\r\nr faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every life situation=\r\n with no complaints and did the best possible action then. Even as he kille=\r\nd Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma=\r\n. Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some su=\r\nbjects that were going to disappear with Ravana!\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;Rama is a perfec=\r\nt example of a liberated man with no desires or agendas who impassionately =\r\ndischarges one&#39;s dharma arising from the momentum of karmas before liberati=\r\non. THAT is basically what soul does!\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;As another example, let us look at Lord\n&gt;  V=\r\naamana. His story is a perfect demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination o=\r\nperates.\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;He was born as a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cos=\r\nmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king with many great qualities.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt;Wisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unassuming. When one is d=\r\noing good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment=\r\n), one&#39;s discrimination is not pleased until that pride is suppressed. When=\r\n wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, then demonic qualities are comple=\r\ntely suppressed.\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;Please think about the other avataras. The stories can be underst=\r\nood as perfect demonstrations of how various aspects of our consciousness o=\r\nperate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara.\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;Let us not compare=\r\n Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them separately. Of course, if you are =\r\nmore\n&gt;  attracted to one of them, please think about that avatara more and =\r\ndevelop devotion. They are ALL capable of relieving us from samsara.\n&gt; &gt;=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;By the way, h=\r\nappy Hanumajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are different sc=\r\nhools of thought).\n&gt; &gt;=A0\n&gt; &gt;Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;Astr=\r\nology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n&gt; &gt;--------=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
