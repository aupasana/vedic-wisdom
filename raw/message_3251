Als=\r\no I agree to the point that a meat eater, if he were to eat veg food for so=\r\nme months while reading the scriptures would feel spiritually benefited. On=\r\ne year back I had tried it for 108 days and I definitely felt some positive=\r\n=A0effects like a sense of purity of the mind.\n=A0\nNarasimha said:\n=A0\nEati=\r\nng meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and identification with bo=\r\ndy and makes spiritual progress more difficult. After all, if one is eating=\r\n flesh of an animal that was highly attached to its body, the quality of bo=\r\ndy attachment will become denser in one. This is not conducive to spiritual=\r\n progress.\n=A0\nWith due respect to everyone, I am not=A0convinced of the ab=\r\nove lines though I agree that for a meat eater, turning vegetarian is spiri=\r\ntually beneficial. I have a different explanation. A meat eater is basicall=\r\ny addicted to the taste of meat. When he forgoes the same, it requires a de=\r\ngree of will-power and a conscious sense of direction in the mind. Like ove=\r\nrcoming any addiction with a clear sense of purpose that I am doing it to h=\r\nelp me spiritually benefit. This in turn, when successfully done, creates a=\r\n sense of purity in the mind. The reason for the purity is not so much abou=\r\nt eating veg food, but more due to the mental force created by conscious ab=\r\nstinence from non veg food. \n=A0\nSimilarly, a regular=A0vegeterian, if he o=\r\nr she were to shift to a diet of ONLY milk and fruits for some months=A0- w=\r\nhich is not his staple diet -=A0 would feel a similar effect. As I see it, =\r\ngeneration of will power is teh first conscinous effect of the=A0beauty of =\r\nsadhana. This sense of mental purity maybe - I am not sure - related to the=\r\n generation of more bhutaagni. That which jolts you out of your normal regu=\r\nlarized habits will create a force in the mind which is beneficial.\n=A0\nSpe=\r\naking of ego, for an average man not engaging in any specific spiritual=A0p=\r\nursuit (sadhana), I have really not encountered any difference between peop=\r\nle who are strict vegeterians from birth or people who have an omnivorous d=\r\niet. That is why I am not at all convinced that an omnivorous diet for an n=\r\normal human being blocks or aids him in any way any more than a vegeterian =\r\ndiet does. =A0BUT abstinence in any form and any degree,=A0is=A0a GREAT too=\r\nl for spiritual benefit.\n=A0\nI hope I expressed my view point clearly.\n=A0\n=\r\nDear Utpal,\n=A0\nDo not think that I&#39;ll be offended or misunderstand you to =\r\nbe a cruel hearted etc...\n=A0\nThanks!:)\n=A0\nVegterianism is related to Comp=\r\nession against cruelty.

I ju=\r\nst saw a few mails from the vegetarianism thread. Just a few quick points.\n=\r\n\n* * *\n\nSelf-identification of human beings and animals with body and body =\r\nparts is much much stronger and denser than that of plants and trees. Self-=\r\nidentification of plants and trees is very subtle. When a leaf or flower or=\r\n fruit is plucked or cut off from a plant or tree, the emotion experienced =\r\nby it is very subtle. On the other hand, if a body part is cut off in an an=\r\nimal or a human being, the emotion experienced is much stronger. Even after=\r\n death, an animal may identify with the body and think of it as &quot;I&quot;.\n\nThe k=\r\naarmik debt formed by eating the flesh of an animal, which the animal&#39;s min=\r\nd considers as a part of &quot;I&quot; and is highly attached to, is much bigger than=\r\n the kaarmik debt formed by eating leaves, vegetables or fruits of a\n plant=\r\n or a tree or killing bacteria.\n\nAs long as we live in a physical body, cre=\r\nation of new kaarmik debts is inevitable. But we strive to minimize the deb=\r\nts we create newly.\n\n* * *\n\nYou are what you eat. Our body and various chem=\r\nicals and hormones in it are formed based on what we eat.\n\nMeat is highly t=\r\naamasik. Eating meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and identific=\r\nation with body and makes spiritual progress more difficult. After all, if =\r\none is eating flesh of an animal that was highly attached to its body, the =\r\nquality of body attachment will become denser in one. This is not conducive=\r\n to spiritual progress.\n\n* * *\n\nIt is possible that a spiritual giant from =\r\npast ate meat and yet remained fully saattwik. However, it is not easy to e=\r\nmulate such a person. One wanting to overcome identification with the body =\r\nand make spiritual progress, is better off eating saattwik food (simple veg=\r\netables, fruits, greens,\n grains etc with mild spices).\n\nIf a meat-eating p=\r\nerson stops eating meat and eats cooked vegetables, greens and lentils/dals=\r\n (for protein) for several months, while trying to read spiritual literatur=\r\ne and trying to make spiritual progress, one will see that it makes a big d=\r\nifference.\n\n* * *\n\nSomeone mentioned that Vyasa liked fish, Radha cooked de=\r\ner for Krishna etc. In matters like this, there is a lot of misguided propa=\r\nganda in modern India. Assertions not backed by specific quotes from classi=\r\ncs or scriptures that can be verified by scholars are best ignored.\n\nSwami =\r\nVivekananda and Aurobindo may have given a clarion call to Indians to be mo=\r\nre pro-active and energetic. But that does not require eating meat. It is w=\r\nrong to attribute to them support of meat eating.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n=\r\n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\r\n--0-119047622-1260835583=:35475\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;Namaste Rajarshi,&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When a being i=\r\ns not established in Brahman, but established in duality, such a being has =\r\nnotions of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;others&quot;.

Also I agree to the =\r\npoint that a meat eater, if he were to eat veg food for some months while r=\r\neading the scriptures would feel spiritually benefited. One year back I had=\r\n tried it for 108 days and I definitely felt some positive&nbsp;effects lik=\r\ne a sense of purity of the mind.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Narasimha sai=\r\nd:&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Eating meat increases tamas in one. It =\r\nincreases ego and identification with body and makes spiritual progress mor=\r\ne difficult. After all, if one is eating flesh of an animal that was highly=\r\n attached to its body, the quality of body attachment will become denser in=\r\n one. This is not conducive to spiritual progress.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;With due respect to everyone, I am not&nbsp;convinced of=\r\n the above lines though I agree that for a meat eater, turning vegetarian i=\r\ns &lt;em&gt;spiritually&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;beneficial&lt;/em&gt;. I have a different explanation.=\r\n A meat eater is basically addicted to the taste of meat. When he forgoes t=\r\nhe same, it requires a degree of will-power and a conscious sense of direct=\r\nion in the mind. Like overcoming any addiction with a clear sense of purpos=\r\ne that I am doing it to help me spiritually benefit. This in turn, when suc=\r\ncessfully done, creates a sense of purity in the mind. The reason for the p=\r\nurity is not so much about eating veg food, but more due to the mental forc=\r\ne created by conscious abstinence from non veg food. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Similarly, a regular&nbsp;vegeterian, if he or she were to shift to=\r\n a diet of ONLY milk and fruits for some months&nbsp;- which is not his sta=\r\nple diet -&nbsp; would feel a similar effect. As I see it, generation of wi=\r\nll power is teh first conscinous effect of the&nbsp;beauty of sadhana. This=\r\n sense of mental purity maybe - I am not sure - related to the generation o=\r\nf more bhutaagni. That which jolts you out of your normal regularized habit=\r\ns will create a force in the mind which is beneficial.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Speaking of ego, for an average man not engaging in any specific s=\r\npiritual&nbsp;pursuit (sadhana), I have really not encountered any differen=\r\nce between people who are strict vegeterians from birth or people who have =\r\nan omnivorous diet. That is why I am not at all convinced that an omnivorou=\r\ns diet for an normal human being blocks or aids him in any way any more tha=\r\nn a vegeterian diet does. &nbsp;BUT abstinence in any form and any degree,&=\r\nnbsp;is&nbsp;a GREAT tool for spiritual benefit.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;I hope I expressed my view point clearly.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;D=\r\near Utpal,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Do not think that I&#39;ll be offen=\r\nded or misunderstand you to be a cruel hearted etc...&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Thanks!:)&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;Vegterianism is rel=\r\nated to Compession against cruelty. Dharma (Non Violence)&lt;br&gt;against Adhara=\r\nma (Killing Innocent creatures).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;I get what you mean thought I do see dharma/adharma that way. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;your second Para and some writings in your earlier me=\r\nssage gives me impression that you are heavily philosophising. Karama, Desh=\r\n/kaal etc... does not appeal me. to be very honest.&nbsp;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nem&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;In my opinon, if one can justify eating&nbsp;=\r\npopular meat of&nbsp;chicken, etc..&nbsp;then anything under the Sun is eat=\r\nable.&nbsp; with that logic, those people who choose to eat Crab, Snakes, i=\r\nnsects, cocroaches are perfectly alright. even people who have started eati=\r\nng human flesh are also acceptable and not doing anything wrong as per the =\r\n&#39;their&#39; thinking.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;To talk ab=\r\nout Karma, Conditioning, Culture&nbsp;etc..., and&nbsp;try to&nbsp;make qua=\r\nlity judgements by the logic of &#39;Direct killing&#39; and &#39;eating meat of alread=\r\ny dead&#39; does not go well with me.&nbsp;it is&nbsp;just a philosophy to cove=\r\nr up.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I guess I will just have t=\r\no&nbsp;agree to disagree with you. We look at things differently: )&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;One more&nbsp;point I would like to question. Some of the other mails ment=\r\nioned that people (non-vegeterians)&nbsp;should get out of the &#39;addiction&#39; =\r\nof taste for non-veg. While I agree that non-veg food is addictive to one w=\r\nho eats it, I would like to ask, is not vegeterian food addictive to one wh=\r\no is a thorough bred vegetarian? Or are we implying that those who eat veg =\r\nfood - vegeterains by birth - are not &#39;addicted&#39; to food at all, and do not=\r\n enjoy the food they eat? &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Ordinary we are all=\r\n addicted to food, veg or non-veg, and eat for our palates as much as for o=\r\nur stomachs, or so I thought.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;stro=\r\nng&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size: 10pt; color: navy; font-family: Verdan=\r\na;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot; face=3D&quot;Courier&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000=\r\n07f&quot;&gt;There is no intoxication greater than the sweet name of God&lt;/font&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/font&gt;- Vimalananda.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/st=\r\nrong&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Sun, 13/12/09, pvr108 &lt;i&gt;&lt;pvr108@yahoo. com&=\r\ngt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, =\r\n16, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: pvr108 &lt;pvr108@yahoo. com&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] On the Vegetarianism Thread&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;br&gt;=\r\nDate: Sunday, 13 December, 2009, 4:22 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1212485859&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I have bee=\r\nn extremely busy at work for a while now and will continue to be, working l=\r\nong hours everyday. I just saw a few mails from the vegetarianism thread. J=\r\nust a few quick points.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Self-identification of human be=\r\nings and animals with body and body parts is much much stronger and denser =\r\nthan that of plants and trees. Self-identification of plants and trees is v=\r\nery subtle. When a leaf or flower or fruit is plucked or cut off from a pla=\r\nnt or tree, the emotion experienced by it is very subtle. On the other hand=\r\n, if a body part is cut off in an animal or a human being, the emotion expe=\r\nrienced is much stronger. Even after death, an animal may identify with the=\r\n body and think of it as &quot;I&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The kaarmik debt formed by eating the =\r\nflesh of an animal, which the animal&#39;s mind considers as a part of &quot;I&quot; and =\r\nis highly attached to, is much bigger than the kaarmik debt formed by eatin=\r\ng leaves, vegetables or fruits of a\n plant or a tree or killing bacteria.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;As long as we live in a physical body, creation of new kaarmik debts =\r\nis inevitable. But we strive to minimize the debts we create newly.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;You are what you eat. Our body and various chemicals and hormo=\r\nnes in it are formed based on what we eat.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Meat is highly taamasik. =\r\nEating meat increases tamas in one. It increases ego and identification wit=\r\nh body and makes spiritual progress more difficult. After all, if one is ea=\r\nting flesh of an animal that was highly attached to its body, the quality o=\r\nf body attachment will become denser in one. This is not conducive to spiri=\r\ntual progress.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It is possible that a spiritual giant fr=\r\nom past ate meat and yet remained fully saattwik. However, it is not easy t=\r\no emulate such a person. One wanting to overcome identification with the bo=\r\ndy and make spiritual progress, is better off eating saattwik food (simple =\r\nvegetables, fruits, greens,\n grains etc with mild spices).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If a meat=\r\n-eating person stops eating meat and eats cooked vegetables, greens and len=\r\ntils/dals (for protein) for several months, while trying to read spiritual =\r\nliterature and trying to make spiritual progress, one will see that it make=\r\ns a big difference.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;* * *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Someone mentioned that Vyasa liked =\r\nfish, Radha cooked deer for Krishna etc. In matters like this, there is a l=\r\not of misguided propaganda in modern India. Assertions not backed by specif=\r\nic quotes from classics or scriptures that can be verified by scholars are =\r\nbest ignored.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Swami Vivekananda and Aurobindo may have given a clari=\r\non call to Indians to be more pro-active and energetic. But that does not r=\r\nequire eating meat. It is wrong to attribute to them support of meat eating=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;=\r\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n \n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/=\r\ntr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-119047622-1260835583=:35475--\r\n\n"}}
