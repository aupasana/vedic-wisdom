Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; A fantastic question =\r\nand one that downplays the importance of religion and rituals in the minds =\r\nof intelligent and rational people! Hence a very important question to answ=\r\ner..\n&gt;  \n&gt; To answer it, I will go back to the analogy I gave just a few da=\r\nys back:\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1673 (Why=\r\n rituals)\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The child is taught by parents to=\r\n say things like &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;sorry&quot; in different situations. I compare=\r\nd it to engaging in rituals and repeating mantras without understanding. I =\r\nsaid that the child slowly understands the true meaning with experience and=\r\n feels the emotions represented by those words when saying them. I compared=\r\n it to a sadhaka experiencing spiritual truths represented by the rituals a=\r\ns he gains experience and becomes more ready.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Now, think about this. =\r\nParents speaking different languages teach different words to the child. A =\r\nparent speaking English may teach &quot;I am sorry&quot;. A parent speaking Hindi may=\r\n teach &quot;mujhe maaf keejiye&quot;. Another Hindi speaking person may teach &quot;mujhe=\r\n maaf karo&quot;. A parent speaking Telugu may teach &quot;nannu kshaminchandi&quot;. Anot=\r\nher Telugu speaking person may teach &quot;nannu kshaminchu&quot;. And so on. The wor=\r\nds are different. But they represent the same thought and emotion.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ac=\r\ntually, at one level, the meaning is slightly different in each case, depen=\r\nding on the peculiarities and cultural context of the language used. For ex=\r\nample, the English expression has &quot;I&quot; as the subject and one is talking abo=\r\nut how one feels. The Hindi and Telugu expressions have the other person as=\r\n the subject and asking him to forgive. The amount of respect shown is diff=\r\nerent in different expressions. Thus, the exact meaning is slightly differe=\r\nnt. Thus, children speaking different languages may visualize something sli=\r\nghtly different as their understanding of the languages improves. However, =\r\nthese differences are minor. As one delves deeper, the basic emotions assoc=\r\niated with these different expressions is the same in different languages a=\r\nnd one will feel those emotions with compassion as one masters the language=\r\n.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, deities, rituals and mantras used in different religious=\r\n traditions may be different, but they may represent the same divine energy=\r\n and the same spiritual experiences. Just as the immeidate visualization of=\r\n an expression in the mind of a child may change based on cultural context =\r\nand grammar that one is exposed to, the immeidate imagination of a deity&#39;s =\r\ngross/external form in the mind of a sadhaka may change based on the religi=\r\nous paradigms and spirutal context that one is exposed to. However, these d=\r\nifferences are minor. As one delves deeper, the basic energies and experien=\r\nces represented by various deities and rituals are the same in different re=\r\nligious traditions and one will experience the same spiritual truths as one=\r\n masters one&#39;s path.\n&gt;  \n&gt; No wonder Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa=\r\n vadanti&quot; (Truth is One, but the learned say it differently).\n&gt;  \n&gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; One language may have a lot of different words for an ob=\r\nject with slight variation whereas another language may have fewer words. A=\r\ns an example, a language spoken near equator may have a single word for &quot;sn=\r\now&quot;, &quot;ice&quot;, &quot;dew&quot;, &quot;mist&quot; etc, whereas English has so many words. Native la=\r\nnguage of Alaskans, who live in snow and ice most of the year, has many mor=\r\ne words than English for slightly different kinds of snow, whereas English =\r\ncalls all of them as &quot;snow&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, religious traditions that exp=\r\nlored slightly different kinds of the same divine energy may have personifi=\r\ned those energies as different deities. So some religions may have more dei=\r\nties than some other religions. Some religions may have a lot of deities fo=\r\nr different variations of a similar purpose, whereas another religion may h=\r\nave only one deity.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; If communication can be=\r\n internalized and we can communicate with our emotions, we do not need lang=\r\nuage and we will all be on the same page always. But we cannot communicate =\r\nwith our internal emotions and need an external method. So language is need=\r\ned. But language can divide.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Similarly, spiritual truths are internal=\r\n (like our emotions). In order to express them and transmit them to others,=\r\n we need deities, mantras, rituals and religion. But religion can divide.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; One child may say &quot;I am sorry&quot; and another may say another expression =\r\nmeaning the same thing and they may argue who is right. One may say &quot;my fat=\r\nher said this is correct&quot; and another may say &quot;my mother said this is corre=\r\nct&quot; and they may fight on who is correct. People fighting over whose religi=\r\non is superior and trying to &quot;convert&quot; others are like such children. Unfor=\r\ntunately, my &quot;child and language&quot; analogy is too mild in this area and the =\r\nfights between religions have been far worse than two children arguing abou=\r\nt their language. Countless people have been murdered in the name of religi=\r\non.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Instead of arguing which expression is correct and finding fault =\r\nwith others, children learning should focus on the true meaning of what the=\r\ny saying and try to understand what exactly their expression means and feel=\r\n the correct emotions when they say things. Similarly, instead of fighting =\r\nwith others on religion, one should try to understand one&#39;s own religion be=\r\ntter and experience the spiritual truths represented in that religion.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; One may think there is a Christian god, an Isla=\r\nmic god, a Hindu god etc and they are responsible for respective religions =\r\nand societies. That is not true.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one believes that there is a supr=\r\neme deity (whatever the name you use to describe) who creates all beings, t=\r\nhen one has to realize that Vyasa, Buddha, Christ, Propher Mohammed and Mah=\r\navira were sent to this earth by that same supreme deity and different reli=\r\ngions came into being only because that supreme deity willed so! Each relig=\r\nion serves a useful purpose at a given place and a time. When a religion&#39;s =\r\ntime is up, it goes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Some may say that exte=\r\nrnal forms of deities who personify different aspects of divine energy runn=\r\ning the universe are a creation of the mind. However, they are not a creati=\r\non of the current state of mind. Mind has accumulated many layers of condit=\r\nioning though many lives. Thus, one may not have ever seen or thought about=\r\n or imagined a specific form of a deity in this life, but may have a vision=\r\n of that form, on account of conditioning accumulated through many lives. A=\r\nn example is the boy mentioned in the following message:\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://group=\r\ns.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/761\n&gt;  \n&gt; He had not read about some=\r\n of the avataras of Vishnu he saw above the fire. But he saw them and could=\r\n describe them. This is because those forms represent a personification of =\r\na certain energy and his mind imagined that energy in that form in a previo=\r\nus life. The memory stayed with the mind (though not consciously) and it ca=\r\nn come back anytime. So, though he did not know about that form, that form =\r\nappeared before him.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Swami Vivekananda famously said (paraphrased), &quot;=\r\na human being imagines god as a super human being with many hands and heads=\r\n. If a buffalo imagines god, it may imagine god as a super buffalo with man=\r\ny horns&quot;. Though he is right in a sense, it is misleading too. It may incor=\r\nrectly trivialize external forms. Though external forms are a work of the m=\r\nind, that does not make them unimportant.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Until one learns how to fee=\r\nl sorry and show that feeling, saying &quot;I am sorry&quot; as a ritual is an import=\r\nant habit. Not teaching a child words because he cannot anyway understand t=\r\nheir correct meaning is wrong. The child should be taught even if he does n=\r\not understand. He will understand the true meaning later Similarly, though =\r\nthe energy represented by a form is more basic than a specific external for=\r\nm associated with that energy, many people will reach that energy only by i=\r\nmagining that form and worshipping that form. So, if one&#39;s mind tends to im=\r\nagine a form, one should imagine the form and worship that form.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thou=\r\ngh we say that forms of deities and mystical experiences are a creation of =\r\nmind, that is in a vedantic sense, i.e. the entire manifested universe is a=\r\n creation of the mind (over many lives). Only Brahman is real and not creat=\r\ned by the mind. Everything else is a creation of the mind over the time. If=\r\n we say that a form of a deity or an experience is an imagination of the mi=\r\nnd, it does not mean it is a hallucination. Mind is connected to its field =\r\nof experience. Various minds in its field of experience are connected to it=\r\n. For example, the experience described in the following message was indepe=\r\nndently &quot;observed&quot; by two people. Human mind can imagine things and halluci=\r\nnate, but two minds observing the same thing is different from a typical ha=\r\nllucination:\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; Most divine forms and divine experiences chronicled in sacred texts of=\r\n various religions have been independently experienced by multiple people.\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; When someone looks sad, one person may say =\r\n&quot;he is sad&quot;. Another person may say &quot;woh dukhi hai&quot;. Another person may say=\r\n &quot;vaadu baadha padutunnaadu&quot;. Similarly, when a divine energy is present in=\r\n a place, one may perceive the energy as deity X and another may perceive i=\r\nt as a deity Y. Just as the expression one uses to describe the feeling one=\r\n perceives is based on the language one knows, similarly the form mentioned=\r\n by one to describe the enegy one perceives depends on the conditioning of =\r\none&#39;s mind and the religious tradition one is exposed to.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I know one =\r\nperson who does Chandi homam. When he finishes the homam, he calls back the=\r\n Divine Mother into his heart by showing the fire with his hands and motion=\r\ning the hands towards his heart (with eyes closed). When he does it, he jus=\r\nt perceives a nice energy around him and feels peaceful and happy. When he =\r\nwas doing this oneday, a gentleman was visiting and sitting right behind hi=\r\nm. His eyes were closed and he was meditating. When the above happened, he =\r\nwas baffled and opened his eyes to see what was going on. He had a vision o=\r\nf a dark goddess who was jumping towards him along with a big pile of kumku=\r\nm (vermillion powder) all around Her. He was overwhelmed by the vision and =\r\nopened his eyes. But the person who did homam perceived only some nice ener=\r\ngy and no specific form. Thus, the same energy may be perceived by differen=\r\nt people in a different form. One person may perceive only some energy and =\r\nanother may perceive a specific form. Yet another may perceive a different =\r\nform. The exact perception is based on the conditioning of the mind. But th=\r\ne energy itself is uniform, though the form is not.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *       =\r\n *\n&gt;  \n&gt; I have covered various aspects related to this topic.
