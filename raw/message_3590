Intention/desire is a powerful thing. It controls our mind =\r\nand our actions. Because of its power and control over the mind, it is comp=\r\nared to a king.\n\nSamaadhi means focus or concentration. Businessman named S=\r\namaadhi is a metaphor for one&#39;s focus and concentration. While desires typi=\r\ncally excite mind into an active mode, focus (on anything) typically tricks=\r\n the mind and soothes it. That is why it is compared to a vaisya (a busines=\r\nsman), who knows what he wants and mesmerizes people into giving it to him.=\r\n\n\nMedhas means intelligence. Rishi named Medhas is a metaphor for intellige=\r\nnce. While one&#39;s desires and focus may be deluded and run after material th=\r\nings, one&#39;s intelligence is firmly established in god and clear about what =\r\nis what. No confusion. That is why intelligence is compared to a rishi!\n\n*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nIf one desires a luxury car, wife&#39;s happiness, son&#39;s profes=\r\nsional success and other material things like that, one&#39;s intelligence cann=\r\not really educate and direct the desire within one towards finding Self. Si=\r\nmilarly, if one&#39;s concentration is directed at work and various mundane tas=\r\nks, intelligence cannot really educate and direct one&#39;s concentration towar=\r\nds finding Self.\n\nSimilarly, when king Suratha and businessman Samadhi were=\r\n pre-occupied with their families, their kingdom, wealth etc, rishi Medhas =\r\ncould not really direct them towards the divine Mother.\n\nOnce the king and =\r\nthe businessman were forced to turn away from their families etc, they land=\r\ned up at the ashram of rishi Medhas and he could educate them on how to fin=\r\nd the divine Mother.\n\nSimilarly, when one&#39;s desire and concentration are tu=\r\nrned away from the regular things they are usually centred around (sense ob=\r\njects and material things), then intelligence can direct one&#39;s desire and c=\r\noncentration towards finding the Self.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nOf course, desire =\r\nand concentration turning away from material things and approaching intelli=\r\ngence for guidance is the *beginning* of the thirteen chapters of Chandipat=\r\nh. The rest is how intelligence instructs them on finding Self. All the sto=\r\nries are a metaphorical representation of various phases and challenges enc=\r\nountered as one strives to find Self.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nThe last (13th) ch=\r\napter says that the king and the businessman worshipped the divine Mother a=\r\nfter the instruction from the rishi and She appeared before them. The divin=\r\ne Mother gave them boons.\n\nKing got a boon that he will get back his kingdo=\r\nm and be born as the son of Sun named Saavarni. Businessman got a boon that=\r\n he will get absolute knowledge and liberation. Now let us understand what =\r\nthat means.\n\nWhen one&#39;s desire and focus are directed to Self-realization, =\r\none finally realizes Self.\n\nOne&#39;s power of concentration always becomes one=\r\n with the object of concentration when it succeeds. When one&#39;s power of con=\r\ncentration is not directed at a mundane object/task but not imperishable Se=\r\nlf, one&#39;s concentration merges with the imperishable Self. That is why the =\r\nbusinessman named Samadhi got absolute knowledge and liberation.\n\nA Self-re=\r\nalized person becomes a jeevanmukta (liberated while living) and his power =\r\nof concentration is directed at god even as he pursues many things. He may =\r\n&quot;want&quot; to build a temple or spread dharma or destroy a kingdom or establish=\r\n a new kingdom or whatever, but, despite his apparent activities, focus of =\r\nhis mind is on Self. One is an instrument of infinite divine Will and engag=\r\nes in various actions non-volitionally. The intentions/desires of such a pe=\r\nrson are not his, but those of Nature. When he gets an intention to do some=\r\nthing, he non-volitionally engages in an action, with a full and deep under=\r\nstanding that the objects he is interacting with during that action are jus=\r\nt projections of Self.\n\nThis is the meaning of king Suratha being reborn as=\r\n the son of Sun. The intentions/desires within one are now coming from Natu=\r\nre/Self and not from one&#39;s own conditioning (which is non-existent now). Th=\r\nat is the meaning of Suratha being reborn as the son (coming from) of Sun (=\r\nSelf).\n\nSaavarni is the name of the reborn king. Some people may translate =\r\n&quot;saavarni&quot; to mean &quot;one having the same color&quot;, but my translation is &quot;the =\r\ntransparent one&quot;. The desires/intentions behind the actions of a jeevanmukt=\r\na are transparent, i.e. free from any conditioning or individual agenda. Su=\r\nch a person may engage in many kinds of actions, but the power of concentra=\r\ntion of such a person never wavers from Self!\n\nThus, the ending of the stor=\r\ny metaphorically represents what happens to the desires/intentions and the =\r\npower of concentration/focus within one, after they have been directed at f=\r\ninding Self, one finds Self and becomes liberated while living.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n\nThis is very high philosophy. Whatever little I could understand, I =\r\ntried to express it in simple words. I hope it made some sense to some of y=\r\nou. If this is confusing, please do not worry. Bookish knowledge and intell=\r\nectual understanding helps only a little. Do sadhana.
