Blind faith should be turned into rational faith and reason should=\r\n be turned into experience. As a pitiable instance at the present day, it m=\r\nay be pointed out that the most treacherous kind of =E2=80=9Ccomfortable re=\r\nligion=E2=80=9D and comfortable philosophy is being preached by many of the=\r\n ultra-rationalists and pedants, and it has become a fashion and a cunning =\r\npleasure to talk against renunciation, against the order of sannyasa. =E2=\r\n=80=9CRenounce the ego, there is no need of abandoning family and society; =\r\nUpanishads declare like that; Gita says like that=E2=80=9D=E2=80&quot;this is th=\r\ne perverted interpretation of the man of vanity and attachment, lust and gr=\r\need! Man is ashamed to admit his folly in not abstaining from the loathsome=\r\n sensual enjoyments; he wants to lead a cowardly life of sense-indulgence, =\r\nand tries to protect himself within the fort of crooked commentaries on the=\r\n philosophical scriptures. He uses philosophical argument to justify worldl=\r\ny enjoyment. Even a devil has begun to quote the authentic scriptures in or=\r\nder to fulfil its desires and ambitions. Examples of Janakas and Vashisthas=\r\n are cited as indisputable and authoritative justification for adherence to=\r\n family life. \n\n\n"}}
