After all, most people who believe in God\n=\r\nlook at him as a limited being to barter with. All of our biases and\nassump=\r\ntions are most apparent when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion\nhas sim=\r\nply served to formalize these biases.\n\nWhile being mired in this word of du=\r\nality, we think that an ounce of\ninsincere prayer can undo the whole weight=\r\n of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in\nthroughout the day. And we lay this bias on o=\r\nur God. No wonder that others\nlook at all the suffering in the world and la=\r\nugh at this concept of God. We\n&quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n\nWe all hav=\r\ne plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of\nasking for t=\r\nhe strength to be steadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits,\nwe ask God =\r\nto burn &quot;paapa&quot; and leave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. It is us &quot;God\nbelievers&quot; who =\r\nlook at our lives, ignoring all the &quot;paapa phala&quot;. We look\nat one or two in=\r\nstances of &quot;punya phala&quot; and declare our prayers to be\nsuccessful. However,=\r\n an impartial observer sees it for what it is, and\nlaughs at us. We &quot;God be=\r\nlievers&quot; are the culprit.\n\nFor the most part, our bhakti is weak. When we a=\r\nre engaged in spiritual\npractices, our bhakti is particularly weak, and we =\r\ncount the seconds and\nminutes. When engaged in worldly pursuits, our bhakti=\r\n is strong, and time\nreally flies. And yet, we expect God to reward our wea=\r\nk spiritual bhakti\nand ignore our strong worldly bhakti. An impartial obser=\r\nver sees it for\nwhat it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the cu=\r\nlprit.\n\nThe best way to bring about new waves of bhakti is not to look at t=\r\nhe\n&quot;non-believers&quot; and try to convert them. All we have to do is try to\neli=\r\nminate our lack of belief, and be honest with ourselves. If we can\ntransfor=\r\nm ourselves, the world will be served.\n\nIf we see God as the limitless powe=\r\nr that he is, he is difficult to define.\nIt is difficult to capture him wit=\r\nhin a religion. Religion should see\nitself as a stepping-stone, and should =\r\nask each of us to _eventually_ place\nour feet on top of it to reach the hig=\r\nher goals. Unfortunately, most\nreligions ask us to accept them without ques=\r\ntion. They ask us to place our\nheads on them with reverence, and try to pre=\r\nvent the spiritually advanced\nfrom going any farther.\n\nsasneham,\n\n   ajit\n\r\n--bcaec53d5ed7ec330c04c57635e7\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nDear Prasanth,&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt; To those who say that they don=92t b=\r\nelieve in any religion&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In genera=\r\nl, many of those who don&#39;t believe in religion or God are being more ho=\r\nnest than those who do.
