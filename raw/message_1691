Most of our puranic st=\r\nories are made fun of by others. \n\nWell in most of the cases these question=\r\ns are of malicious intent, those don&#39;t bother me much, but at some point so=\r\nmeone ask&#39;s these questions genuinely.\n=A0\nI tried reading different opinio=\r\nns of different respected saints and I found one explanation in the introud=\r\nuctory chapters on Sri Aurobindo&#39;s &quot;Secrets of the Vedas&quot;.\n=A0\nHe opines in=\r\ndirectly that the Puranas are definitely a toned down version of what used =\r\nto be the Vedic knowledge. This was made this way for the oridinary people =\r\nto understand and not leave the folds of Hinduism. The threat then was Budd=\r\nhism. That is why not only these stories were &quot;made&quot; which were based on de=\r\neper spiritual symbolism generated from the Vedas but even the lagugae was =\r\nmodified and made easier. The sanskrit of the Vedas is different from the s=\r\nanskrit of the puranic age.\n=A0\nThe reason Buddism could become such a thre=\r\nat to Hinduism was because the people (priests)=A0had reducded the Vedas to=\r\n a book of mere rituals. The Vedas are both internal and external, but the =\r\npriests took over the religion from the sages/mystics and reduced/neglected=\r\n/forgot the internal and=A0relied solely on the external. That is why Buddh=\r\na rejected the Vedas.\nInfact as per Sri Aurobindo, the comng of Buddha was =\r\na wrong step in the cycle of evolution. He is not the next automatic choice=\r\n after Krishna and that, Kalki will recitify the mistake of Buddha. However=\r\n, the coming of Buddha was in a reverse way, needed to hasten the overall s=\r\npiritual evolution of this world by increasing the distance between God and=\r\n man. \n=A0\nSo essentially, the Purans were somewhat like comemrcial Bollywo=\r\nod movies as compared to the Vedas which were the Art films.\n=A0\nMy persona=\r\nl take on this: As far as they are able to induce spirituality in an very a=\r\nverage ordinary person from a village they are excellent. But at the same t=\r\nime, if a Hindu who is not aware of the comprehensive nature of his own scr=\r\niptures, a poor, uneducated man,=A0is told that his idols are mere stones a=\r\nnd his stories are cock and bull whereas God must be necessarily much beyon=\r\nd all this, the idea of a single God, would be enough reason to make him sw=\r\nitch religions. It would sound very logical to him. Infact, this is how it =\r\noften happens.\n=A0\nSolution: I have no clue. Maybe it is time we need to le=\r\narn our religion better. And the whole host of Babas and Swamis on televisi=\r\non would do well to try and educate their followers about the comprehensive=\r\n/all inclusive=A0nature of Hinduism instead of mere reciting the stories fr=\r\nom teh Puranas.\n=A0\n-Regards\n=A0Rajarshi\n=A0\n=A0\n=A0\n=A0\n=A0\n\nThe upsurge (=\r\nof consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n\n--- On Fri, 24/4/09, utpal pat=\r\nhak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@yaho=\r\no.com&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Our Deities and their stories (Deities i=\r\nn different religions!)\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nDate: Friday, 24 A=\r\npril, 2009, 10:02 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNamaste Narasimha Garu and friends,\n\nRajarshi&#39;=\r\ns question was in some aspect similar to one question i was asked about a m=\r\nonth ago. while traveling back to home from office, one person asked me tha=\r\nt what is these stories of our Gods such as Ganapati and his story of being=\r\n Shiva&#39;s son and cutting of head and replaced by elephant head etc...\nStori=\r\nes of Vishnu and like wise many gods and goddesses.

Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namast=\r\ne,\n&gt; \n&gt; A fantastic question and one that downplays the importance of relig=\r\nion and rituals in the minds of intelligent and rational people! Hence a ve=\r\nry important question to answer..\n&gt; \n&gt; To answer it, I will go back to the =\r\nanalogy I gave just a few days back:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/v=\r\nedic- wisdom/message/ 1673 (Why rituals)\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The child is taugh=\r\nt by parents to say things like &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;sorry&quot; in different situat=\r\nions. I compared it to engaging in rituals and repeating mantras without un=\r\nderstanding. I said that the child slowly understands the true meaning with=\r\n experience and feels the emotions represented by those words when saying t=\r\nhem. I compared it to a sadhaka experiencing spiritual truths represented b=\r\ny the rituals as he gains experience and becomes more ready.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, thin=\r\nk about this. Parents speaking different languages teach different words to=\r\n the child. A parent speaking English may teach &quot;I am sorry&quot;. A parent spea=\r\nking Hindi may teach &quot;mujhe maaf keejiye&quot;. Another Hindi speaking person ma=\r\ny teach &quot;mujhe maaf karo&quot;. A parent speaking Telugu may teach &quot;nannu kshami=\r\nnchandi&quot; . Another Telugu speaking person may teach &quot;nannu kshaminchu&quot;. And=\r\n so on. The words are different. But they represent the same thought and em=\r\notion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, at one level, the meaning is slightly different in ea=\r\nch case, depending on the peculiarities and cultural context of the languag=\r\ne used. For example, the English expression has &quot;I&quot; as the subject and one =\r\nis talking about how one feels. The Hindi and Telugu expressions have the o=\r\nther person as the subject and asking him to forgive. The amount of respect=\r\n shown is different in different expressions. Thus, the exact meaning is sl=\r\nightly different. Thus, children speaking different languages may visualize=\r\n something slightly different as their understanding of the languages impro=\r\nves. However, these differences are minor. As one delves deeper, the basic =\r\nemotions associated with these different expressions is the same in differe=\r\nnt languages and one will feel those emotions with compassion as one master=\r\ns the language.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, deities, rituals and mantras used in differ=\r\nent religious traditions may be different, but they may represent the same =\r\ndivine energy and the same spiritual experiences. Just as the immeidate vis=\r\nualization of an expression in the mind of a child may change based on cult=\r\nural context and grammar that one is exposed to, the immeidate imagination =\r\nof a deity&#39;s gross/external form in the mind of a sadhaka may change based =\r\non the religious paradigms and spirutal context that one is exposed to. How=\r\never, these differences are minor. As one delves deeper, the basic energies=\r\n and experiences represented by various deities and rituals are the same in=\r\n different religious traditions and one will experience the same spiritual =\r\ntruths as one masters one&#39;s path.\n&gt; \n&gt; No wonder Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vip=\r\nraa bahudhaa vadanti&quot; (Truth is One, but the learned say it differently) .\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; One language may have a lot of different words for an objec=\r\nt with slight variation whereas another language may have fewer words. As a=\r\nn example, a language spoken near equator may have a single word for &quot;snow&quot;=\r\n, &quot;ice&quot;, &quot;dew&quot;, &quot;mist&quot; etc, whereas English has so many words. Native langu=\r\nage of Alaskans, who live in snow and ice most of the year, has many more w=\r\nords than English for slightly different kinds of snow, whereas English cal=\r\nls all of them as &quot;snow&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, religious traditions that explore=\r\nd slightly different kinds of the same divine energy may have personified t=\r\nhose energies as different deities. So some religions may have more deities=\r\n than some other religions. Some religions may have a lot of deities for di=\r\nfferent variations of a similar purpose, whereas another religion may have =\r\nonly one deity.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; If communication can be internalized and we=\r\n can communicate with our emotions, we do not need language and we will all=\r\n be on the same page always. But we cannot communicate with our internal em=\r\notions and need an external method. So language is needed. But language can=\r\n divide.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, spiritual truths are internal (like our emotions).=\r\n In order to express them and transmit them to others, we need deities, man=\r\ntras, rituals and religion. But religion can divide.\n&gt; \n&gt; One child may say=\r\n &quot;I am sorry&quot; and another may say another expression meaning the same thing=\r\n and they may argue who is right. One may say &quot;my father said this is corre=\r\nct&quot; and another may say &quot;my mother said this is correct&quot; and they may fight=\r\n on who is correct. People fighting over whose religion is superior and try=\r\ning to &quot;convert&quot; others are like such children. Unfortunately, my &quot;child an=\r\nd language&quot; analogy is too mild in this area and the fights between religio=\r\nns have been far worse than two children arguing about their language. Coun=\r\ntless people have been murdered in the name of religion.\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead of ar=\r\nguing which expression is correct and finding fault with others, children l=\r\nearning should focus on the true meaning of what they saying and try to und=\r\nerstand what exactly their expression means and feel the correct emotions w=\r\nhen they say things. Similarly, instead of fighting with others on religion=\r\n, one should try to understand one&#39;s own religion better and experience the=\r\n spiritual truths represented in that religion.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; One may thi=\r\nnk there is a Christian god, an Islamic god, a Hindu god etc and they are r=\r\nesponsible for respective religions and societies. That is not true.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nf one believes that there is a supreme deity (whatever the name you use to =\r\ndescribe) who creates all beings, then one has to realize that Vyasa, Buddh=\r\na, Christ, Propher Mohammed and Mahavira were sent to this earth by that sa=\r\nme supreme deity and different religions came into being only because that =\r\nsupreme deity willed so! Each religion serves a useful purpose at a given p=\r\nlace and a time. When a religion&#39;s time is up, it goes.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Som=\r\ne may say that external forms of deities who personify different aspects of=\r\n divine energy running the universe are a creation of the mind. However, th=\r\ney are not a creation of the current state of mind. Mind has accumulated ma=\r\nny layers of conditioning though many lives. Thus, one may not have ever se=\r\nen or thought about or imagined a specific form of a deity in this life, bu=\r\nt may have a vision of that form, on account of conditioning accumulated th=\r\nrough many lives. An example is the boy mentioned in the following message:=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 761\n&gt; \n&gt; He ha=\r\nd not read about some of the avataras of Vishnu he saw above the fire. But =\r\nhe saw them and could describe them. This is because those forms represent =\r\na personification of a certain energy and his mind imagined that energy in =\r\nthat form in a previous life. The memory stayed with the mind (though not c=\r\nonsciously) and it can come back anytime. So, though he did not know about =\r\nthat form, that form appeared before him.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Vivekananda famously s=\r\naid (paraphrased) , &quot;a human being imagines god as a super human being with=\r\n many hands and heads. If a buffalo imagines god, it may imagine god as a s=\r\nuper buffalo with many horns&quot;. Though he is right in a sense, it is mislead=\r\ning too. It may incorrectly trivialize external forms. Though external form=\r\ns are a work of the mind, that does not make them unimportant.\n&gt; \n&gt; Until o=\r\nne learns how to feel sorry and show that feeling, saying &quot;I am sorry&quot; as a=\r\n ritual is an important habit. Not teaching a child words because he cannot=\r\n anyway understand their correct meaning is wrong. The child should be taug=\r\nht even if he does not understand. He will understand the true meaning late=\r\nr Similarly, though the energy represented by a form is more basic than a s=\r\npecific external form associated with that energy, many people will reach t=\r\nhat energy only by imagining that form and worshipping that form. So, if on=\r\ne&#39;s mind tends to imagine a form, one should imagine the form and worship t=\r\nhat form.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though we say that forms of deities and mystical experiences=\r\n are a creation of mind, that is in a vedantic sense, i.e. the entire manif=\r\nested universe is a creation of the mind (over many lives). Only Brahman is=\r\n real and not created by the mind. Everything else is a creation of the min=\r\nd over the time. If we say that a form of a deity or an experience is an im=\r\nagination of the mind, it does not mean it is a hallucination. Mind is conn=\r\nected to its field of experience. Various minds in its field of experience =\r\nare connected to it. For example, the experience described in the following=\r\n message was independently &quot;observed&quot; by two people. Human mind can imagine=\r\n things and hallucinate, but two minds observing the same thing is differen=\r\nt from a typical hallucination:\n&gt; \n&gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic-=\r\n wisdom/message/ 951\n&gt; \n&gt; Most divine forms and divine experiences chronicl=\r\ned in sacred texts of various religions have been independently experienced=\r\n by multiple people.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; When someone looks sad, one person may=\r\n say &quot;he is sad&quot;. Another person may say &quot;woh dukhi hai&quot;. Another person ma=\r\ny say &quot;vaadu baadha padutunnaadu&quot; . Similarly, when a divine energy is pres=\r\nent in a place, one may perceive the energy as deity X and another may perc=\r\neive it as a deity Y. Just as the expression one uses to describe the feeli=\r\nng one perceives is based on the language one knows, similarly the form men=\r\ntioned by one to describe the enegy one perceives depends on the conditioni=\r\nng of one&#39;s mind and the religious tradition one is exposed to.\n&gt; \n&gt; I know=\r\n one person who does Chandi homam. When he finishes the homam, he calls bac=\r\nk the Divine Mother into his heart by showing the fire with his hands and m=\r\notioning the hands towards his heart (with eyes closed). When he does it, h=\r\ne just perceives a nice energy around him and feels peaceful and happy. Whe=\r\nn he was doing this oneday, a gentleman was visiting and sitting right behi=\r\nnd him. His eyes were closed and he was meditating. When the above happened=\r\n, he was baffled and opened his eyes to see what was going on. He had a vis=\r\nion of a dark goddess who was jumping towards him along with a big pile of =\r\nkumkum (vermillion powder) all around Her. He was overwhelmed by the vision=\r\n and opened his eyes. But the person who did homam perceived only some nice=\r\n energy and no specific form. Thus, the same energy may be perceived by dif=\r\nferent people in a different form. One person may perceive only some energy=\r\n and another may perceive a specific form. Yet another may\n perceive a diff=\r\nerent form. The exact perception is based on the conditioning of the mind. =\r\nBut the energy itself is uniform, though the form is not.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n have covered various aspects related to this topic.

It would sound very logical to him. Infact, this is how it often happens.=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Solution: I have no clue. Maybe it is time we=\r\n need to learn our religion better. And the whole host of Babas and Swamis =\r\non television would do well to try and educate their followers about the co=\r\nmprehensive/all inclusive&nbsp;nature of Hinduism instead of mere reciting =\r\nthe stories from teh Puranas.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3DMsoN=\r\normal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; FONT-FAMILY: Ver=\r\ndana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D#00007f&gt;T=\r\nhe upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Shiva Sutra&lt;/SPAN=\r\n&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Fri, 24/4/09, utpal p=\r\nathak &lt;I&gt;&lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;PADDING-LEFT: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px; BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px s=\r\nolid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [ve=\r\ndic-wisdom] Re: Our Deities and their stories (Deities in different religio=\r\nns!)&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Friday, 24 April, 2009, 1=\r\n0:02 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv2101890818&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste =\r\nNarasimha Garu and friends,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Rajarshi&#39;s question was in some aspect s=\r\nimilar to one question i was asked about a month ago. while traveling back =\r\nto home from office, one person asked me that what is these stories of our =\r\nGods such as Ganapati and his story of being Shiva&#39;s son and cutting of hea=\r\nd and replaced by elephant head etc...&lt;BR&gt;Stories of Vishnu and like wise m=\r\nany gods and goddesses.

Hence a very imp=\r\nortant question to answer..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To answer it, I will go back t=\r\no the analogy I gave just a few days back:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1673&quot;\n target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 1673&lt;/A&gt;=\r\n (Why rituals)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The child is taught =\r\nby parents to say things like &quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;sorry&quot; in different situatio=\r\nns. I compared it to engaging in rituals and repeating mantras without unde=\r\nrstanding. I said that the child slowly understands the true meaning with e=\r\nxperience and feels the emotions represented by those words when saying the=\r\nm. I compared it to a sadhaka experiencing spiritual truths represented by =\r\nthe rituals as he gains experience and becomes more ready.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Now, think about this. Parents speaking different languages teach differen=\r\nt words to the child. A parent speaking English may teach &quot;I am sorry&quot;. A p=\r\narent speaking Hindi may teach &quot;mujhe maaf keejiye&quot;. Another Hindi speaking=\r\n person may teach &quot;mujhe maaf karo&quot;. A parent speaking Telugu may teach &quot;na=\r\nnnu kshaminchandi&quot; . Another Telugu speaking person\n may teach &quot;nannu ksham=\r\ninchu&quot;. And so on. The words are different. But they represent the same tho=\r\nught and emotion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Actually, at one level, the meaning is s=\r\nlightly different in each case, depending on the peculiarities and cultural=\r\n context of the language used. For example, the English expression has &quot;I&quot; =\r\nas the subject and one is talking about how one feels. The Hindi and Telugu=\r\n expressions have the other person as the subject and asking him to forgive=\r\n. The amount of respect shown is different in different expressions. Thus, =\r\nthe exact meaning is slightly different. Thus, children speaking different =\r\nlanguages may visualize something slightly different as their understanding=\r\n of the languages improves. However, these differences are minor. As one de=\r\nlves deeper, the basic emotions associated with these different expressions=\r\n is the same in different languages and one will feel those emotions with c=\r\nompassion as one masters the\n language.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similarly, deities=\r\n, rituals and mantras used in different religious traditions may be differe=\r\nnt, but they may represent the same divine energy and the same spiritual ex=\r\nperiences. Just as the immeidate visualization of an expression in the mind=\r\n of a child may change based on cultural context and grammar that one is ex=\r\nposed to, the immeidate imagination of a deity&#39;s gross/external form in the=\r\n mind of a sadhaka may change based on the religious paradigms and spirutal=\r\n context that one is exposed to. However, these differences are minor. As o=\r\nne delves deeper, the basic energies and experiences represented by various=\r\n deities and rituals are the same in different religious traditions and one=\r\n will experience the same spiritual truths as one masters one&#39;s path.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; No wonder Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudhaa vadanti&quot; (Trut=\r\nh is One, but the learned say it differently) .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One\n language may have a lot of different words for an object =\r\nwith slight variation whereas another language may have fewer words. As an =\r\nexample, a language spoken near equator may have a single word for &quot;snow&quot;, =\r\n&quot;ice&quot;, &quot;dew&quot;, &quot;mist&quot; etc, whereas English has so many words. Native languag=\r\ne of Alaskans, who live in snow and ice most of the year, has many more wor=\r\nds than English for slightly different kinds of snow, whereas English calls=\r\n all of them as &quot;snow&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similarly, religious traditions th=\r\nat explored slightly different kinds of the same divine energy may have per=\r\nsonified those energies as different deities. So some religions may have mo=\r\nre deities than some other religions. Some religions may have a lot of deit=\r\nies for different variations of a similar purpose, whereas another religion=\r\n may have only one deity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If commun=\r\nication can be internalized and we can communicate with our emotions, we do=\r\n not need\n language and we will all be on the same page always. But we cann=\r\not communicate with our internal emotions and need an external method. So l=\r\nanguage is needed. But language can divide.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Similarly, spi=\r\nritual truths are internal (like our emotions). In order to express them an=\r\nd transmit them to others, we need deities, mantras, rituals and religion. =\r\nBut religion can divide.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One child may say &quot;I am sorry&quot; an=\r\nd another may say another expression meaning the same thing and they may ar=\r\ngue who is right. One may say &quot;my father said this is correct&quot; and another =\r\nmay say &quot;my mother said this is correct&quot; and they may fight on who is corre=\r\nct. People fighting over whose religion is superior and trying to &quot;convert&quot;=\r\n others are like such children. Unfortunately, my &quot;child and language&quot; anal=\r\nogy is too mild in this area and the fights between religions have been far=\r\n worse than two children arguing about their language. Countless people hav=\r\ne\n been murdered in the name of religion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Instead of argui=\r\nng which expression is correct and finding fault with others, children lear=\r\nning should focus on the true meaning of what they saying and try to unders=\r\ntand what exactly their expression means and feel the correct emotions when=\r\n they say things. Similarly, instead of fighting with others on religion, o=\r\nne should try to understand one&#39;s own religion better and experience the sp=\r\niritual truths represented in that religion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One may think there is a Christian god, an Islamic god, a Hindu g=\r\nod etc and they are responsible for respective religions and societies. Tha=\r\nt is not true.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If one believes that there is a supreme dei=\r\nty (whatever the name you use to describe) who creates all beings, then one=\r\n has to realize that Vyasa, Buddha, Christ, Propher Mohammed and Mahavira w=\r\nere sent to this earth by that same supreme deity and different\n religions =\r\ncame into being only because that supreme deity willed so! Each religion se=\r\nrves a useful purpose at a given place and a time. When a religion&#39;s time i=\r\ns up, it goes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some may say that ex=\r\nternal forms of deities who personify different aspects of divine energy ru=\r\nnning the universe are a creation of the mind. However, they are not a crea=\r\ntion of the current state of mind. Mind has accumulated many layers of cond=\r\nitioning though many lives. Thus, one may not have ever seen or thought abo=\r\nut or imagined a specific form of a deity in this life, but may have a visi=\r\non of that form, on account of conditioning accumulated through many lives.=\r\n An example is the boy mentioned in the following message:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/761&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/mess=\r\nage/ 761&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He had not read about some of the\n avataras o=\r\nf Vishnu he saw above the fire. But he saw them and could describe them. Th=\r\nis is because those forms represent a personification of a certain energy a=\r\nnd his mind imagined that energy in that form in a previous life. The memor=\r\ny stayed with the mind (though not consciously) and it can come back anytim=\r\ne. So, though he did not know about that form, that form appeared before hi=\r\nm.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Swami Vivekananda famously said (paraphrased) , &quot;a huma=\r\nn being imagines god as a super human being with many hands and heads. If a=\r\n buffalo imagines god, it may imagine god as a super buffalo with many horn=\r\ns&quot;. Though he is right in a sense, it is misleading too. It may incorrectly=\r\n trivialize external forms. Though external forms are a work of the mind, t=\r\nhat does not make them unimportant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Until one learns how t=\r\no feel sorry and show that feeling, saying &quot;I am sorry&quot; as a ritual is an i=\r\nmportant habit. Not teaching a child words because he\n cannot anyway unders=\r\ntand their correct meaning is wrong. The child should be taught even if he =\r\ndoes not understand. He will understand the true meaning later Similarly, t=\r\nhough the energy represented by a form is more basic than a specific extern=\r\nal form associated with that energy, many people will reach that energy onl=\r\ny by imagining that form and worshipping that form. So, if one&#39;s mind tends=\r\n to imagine a form, one should imagine the form and worship that form.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though we say that forms of deities and mystical experiences a=\r\nre a creation of mind, that is in a vedantic sense, i.e. the entire manifes=\r\nted universe is a creation of the mind (over many lives). Only Brahman is r=\r\neal and not created by the mind. Everything else is a creation of the mind =\r\nover the time. If we say that a form of a deity or an experience is an imag=\r\nination of the mind, it does not mean it is a hallucination. Mind is connec=\r\nted to its field of experience. Various minds\n in its field of experience a=\r\nre connected to it. For example, the experience described in the following =\r\nmessage was independently &quot;observed&quot; by two people. Human mind can imagine =\r\nthings and hallucinate, but two minds observing the same thing is different=\r\n from a typical hallucination:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http=\r\n://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 951&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Most divine forms and divine experiences chronicled in sacred texts of var=\r\nious religions have been independently experienced by multiple people.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When someone looks sad, one person may =\r\nsay &quot;he is sad&quot;. Another person may say &quot;woh dukhi hai&quot;. Another person may=\r\n say &quot;vaadu baadha padutunnaadu&quot; . Similarly, when a divine energy is prese=\r\nnt in a place, one may perceive the energy as deity X and another may perce=\r\nive it as a deity Y. Just as the expression\n one uses to describe the feeli=\r\nng one perceives is based on the language one knows, similarly the form men=\r\ntioned by one to describe the enegy one perceives depends on the conditioni=\r\nng of one&#39;s mind and the religious tradition one is exposed to.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; I know one person who does Chandi homam. When he finishes the homam, =\r\nhe calls back the Divine Mother into his heart by showing the fire with his=\r\n hands and motioning the hands towards his heart (with eyes closed). When h=\r\ne does it, he just perceives a nice energy around him and feels peaceful an=\r\nd happy. When he was doing this oneday, a gentleman was visiting and sittin=\r\ng right behind him. His eyes were closed and he was meditating. When the ab=\r\nove happened, he was baffled and opened his eyes to see what was going on. =\r\nHe had a vision of a dark goddess who was jumping towards him along with a =\r\nbig pile of kumkum (vermillion powder) all around Her. He was overwhelmed b=\r\ny the vision and opened his eyes. But\n the person who did homam perceived o=\r\nnly some nice energy and no specific form. Thus, the same energy may be per=\r\nceived by different people in a different form. One person may perceive onl=\r\ny some energy and another may perceive a specific form. Yet another may per=\r\nceive a different form. The exact perception is based on the conditioning o=\r\nf the mind. But the energy itself is uniform, though the form is not.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I have covered various aspects related t=\r\no this topic.
