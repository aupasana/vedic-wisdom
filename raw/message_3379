I will broadly classify i=\r\nt in 3 groups:\n=A0\n(1) Dual Realization: One can experience closeness to de=\r\nities, oneness to deities etc and realize aspects of Self from a dual persp=\r\nective.\n=A0\n(2) Non-dual Realization: One can merge in non-dual Self. This =\r\nis Nirvikalpa samadhi.\n=A0\nWhen one goes to Nirvikalpa samadhi, one may eit=\r\nher come back and deal with duality again or merge in it forever. If it is =\r\nthe latter, that (i.e. realization of non-dual Self) is the &quot;final realizat=\r\nion&quot; for *that being*.\n=A0\n(3) Realization of Non-difference between Dualit=\r\ny and Non-duality: This is what one pursues if one has to deal with duality=\r\n after merging in non-dual Self. This is an open-ended process. Non-duality=\r\n is the simple underlying Truth in all, but its challenge is that it is imp=\r\nerceptible and reached by subduing I-ness and perception. Duality is percep=\r\ntible, but its challenge is that it has infinite variety and is pursued thr=\r\nough an I-ness and its perception. Keeping an I-ness alive and realizing th=\r\ne oneness of the two is an infinite process with no single event signaling =\r\na &quot;perfect&quot; realization. Rishis and deities are pursuing it constantly.\n=A0=\r\n\nWhen some gods or rishis are back on earth, they may come back to duality =\r\nafter Nirvikalpa samadhi and proceed to deal with the oneness of duality or=\r\n non-dual Self. When some other classes of beings reach Nirvikalpa samadhi,=\r\n they do not come back. As Ramakrishna says, this is like a salt doll that =\r\ngoes to survey the depth of the ocean merging in ocean before reaching the =\r\nocean bed.\n=A0\n*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n=A0\nOne cann=\r\not question why some characters in one&#39;s dream last for the entire dream an=\r\nd some characters last a short time. It is the prerogative of the dreamer. =\r\nSimilarly, we are all dream objects in Supreme Cosmic Being&#39;s long dream ca=\r\nlled Creation and we cannot question why some beings are meant to merge in =\r\nnon-dual self and some are meant to last further.\n=A0\nWhen Adwaita teaches =\r\nthe universe is unreal, it is correct. We are just dream characters. But th=\r\nen, it is also correct that different dream characters have different roles=\r\n to play *within* the dream. Some take part in the dream till the end knowi=\r\nng it is a dream. Some exit the dream once they realize it is immaterial. S=\r\nome take part in the dream without knowing it is a dream and become quite w=\r\norried.

It is a significant step in =\r\none&#39;s spiritual evolution, but still not the ultimate.&quot; - Sadhguru\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n There are various types of samadhis. For the sake of understanding, samadh=\r\nis have been classified into eight forms. Of these eight, they have been br=\r\noadly categorized as savikalpa and nirvikalpa, samadhis with attributes or =\r\nqualities and samadhis without attributes or qualities. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We see wi=\r\nth Isha Yoga, people go into different types of samadhis. Here it is common=\r\n to witness both savikalpa and nirvikalpa types. Samadhi is a certain state=\r\n of equanimity where the intellect goes beyond its normal function of discr=\r\nimination. This, in turn, loosens one from his physical body. In samadhi st=\r\nates, one becomes loose inside the body or there is a space between what is=\r\n you and your body. These samadhis, by themselves have no great significanc=\r\ne in terms of Realization. Experiencing a certain type of samadhi, does not=\r\n mean you are released from Existence. It is just a new level of experience=\r\n. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is like when you were a child, you had one level of experien=\r\nce, once you moved into your adulthood, you have another level of experienc=\r\ne. The same things that you have experienced at a particular point in your =\r\nlife, after a few years, you experience them in a totally different way. So=\r\n, you have moved from one level of experience to another level of experienc=\r\ne. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Samadhis are just like this. You are moving from one level of =\r\nexperience to another level of experience in a much more significant and de=\r\neper sense. Still, it is just another level of experience.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Somebod=\r\ny may go into a certain level of samadhi and stay there for years because i=\r\nt is enjoyable. There is no space or time. There are no bodily problems. He=\r\n has broken the physical and psychological barriers to some extent. But thi=\r\ns is only temporary. The moment he comes out, again he gets hungry, he has =\r\nto sleep, and again everything comes back. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Samadhi definitely has=\r\n its benefits. There are many things it has to offer for an individual, but=\r\n this doesn&#39;t really take you closer to Realization, as such. Compared to a=\r\n man who is sober, a man who is slightly drunk, has a different level of ex=\r\nperience, but he has to come down at some point. All samadhis, I would say,=\r\n are a way of getting high without any external chemicals. Now, by going in=\r\nto these states, it opens up a new dimension for you, but it doesn&#39;t leave =\r\nany great transformation behind. It doesn&#39;t leave you permanently transform=\r\ned. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; You have not moved into another reality. In the same reality,=\r\n your level of experiences has deepened. You have experienced the same thin=\r\ngs in a little deeper sense. You have not become free from the mind. \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Now, somebody meditates for 12 years and comes out. Even after 12 years=\r\n, he may not be a realized being, but, maybe he is a little closer. When yo=\r\nu go into another reality and stay there for long hours or long years, the =\r\ngrip of this reality is broken on you. Now, you have come to an experientia=\r\nl understanding that, this is not it. Not just an intellectual understandin=\r\ng, you have seen experientially that this is not it. That is the whole purp=\r\nose of long meditations. But most realized beings never went into samadhi s=\r\ntates. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Gautama never sat for 12 years in one place. Many of his d=\r\nisciples, many Buddhist monks went into very long meditations. They never c=\r\name out for years, but Gautama himself never went, because he saw it is not=\r\n necessary. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He practiced and experienced all the eight kinds of s=\r\namadhis before his enlightenment and he discarded them. He said, &quot;This is n=\r\not it&quot;. This is not going to take you any closer to realization. It is just=\r\n moving into a higher level of experience and probably you will get more ca=\r\nught up, because it is more beautiful than the current reality. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I=\r\nf the goal is set, if you&#39;ve made realization the top priority in your life=\r\n, then every thing else which doesn&#39;t take you one step closer is meaningle=\r\nss. Let&#39;s say you are climbing the Mount Everest, you will not take one ste=\r\np sideways, because every ounce of energy is needed. Now, if you have to tr=\r\nanscend your own consciousness, you need every ounce of what you have and i=\r\nt&#39;s not enough. So, any action that we perform, we don&#39;t want it to be a si=\r\ndewinder.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; We have created powerful consecrated spaces where experi=\r\nencing samadhi states comes very naturally. There are samadhis that are ver=\r\ny pleasant, blissful, and ecstatic and there are samadhis that are beyond t=\r\nhis. Those who go into samadhi states beyond pleasant or unpleasant, or nir=\r\nvikalpa, we always keep them in protected states as their contact with the =\r\nbody has become very minimal. The smallest disturbance, like a sound or a p=\r\ninprick would dislodge them from their body. These states are maintained fo=\r\nr certain periods to establish the distinction between you and the body. It=\r\n is a significant step in one&#39;s spiritual evolution, but still not the Ulti=\r\nmate.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedi=\r\nc_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; [&quot;When I am in Nirvika=\r\nlpa samadhi, there is no experience.

There are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different k=\r\ninds of samadhi and they can be experienced differently by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different =\r\npeople, as you said. You correctly questioned how different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people ca=\r\nn describe &quot;Nirvikalpa samadhi&quot; differently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The issue =\r\nis this. Nirvikalpa samadhi is a state of being where there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is no &quot;ex=\r\nperiencer&quot;, nothing &quot;to experience&quot; and also no act of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;experiencing&quot;=\r\n. In other words, there is no observer (subject), observed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (object) a=\r\nnd observing (action). All merge into one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When I-ness =\r\n(the sense that &quot;this is I. There are others. I can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; observe them&quot;) di=\r\nsappears, what is the basis for any objectification in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the Supreme Co=\r\nsmic Essence? If there is no objectification, how can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there be any ex=\r\nperience or observation? If there is no observation and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experience, h=\r\now can you describe Nirvikalpa samadhi?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is t=\r\nhat there is nothing to describe in Nirvikalpa samadhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding Nir=\r\nvikalpa samadhi, Manish once said to me: &quot;When I am in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nirvikalpa sam=\r\nadhi, there is no experience. Thus, anything I say about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;experie=\r\nnce&quot; of Nirvikalpa samadhi is actually the observation of an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I-ness a=\r\ns it is being torn down or being reconstructed, i.e. just before\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or a=\r\nfter Nirvikalpa samadhi but not *during* it.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is e=\r\nssentially the problem with &quot;describing&quot; Nirvikalpa samadhi!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2=A0 *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0=\r\n *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In terms of the diamond analogy quoted by Kishore, w=\r\nhat different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yogis are saying about the &quot;experience&quot; of Nirvikalpa s=\r\namadhi says more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; about the path they are taking into the inside of th=\r\ne diamond, rather\n&gt; &gt; &gt; than describing the inside of the diamond itself. O=\r\nne may think &quot;nothing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really exists apart from Brahman - all this I a=\r\nm perceiving is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; delusion&quot;. Another may think &quot;all I perceive is act=\r\nually Brahman&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Another may think &quot;all that I perceive is actually a =\r\nminute part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna&quot;. And so on. Once one is able to focus I-ness =\r\non a specific\n&gt; &gt; &gt; thought and everything else disappears from the mind, o=\r\nne is in samadhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once that I-ness also disappears, one is in Nirvika=\r\nlpa samadhi. However,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one can only describe the last thought on which=\r\n I-ness was focused prior\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to Nirvikalpa samadhi and NOT the Nirvikalp=\r\na samadhi itself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some yogis prefer the stage just befo=\r\nre Nirvikalpa samadhi where a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trace of I-ness is left in an intense f=\r\nocus on one thought, to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi itself. In the former, the=\r\nre is an experience and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bliss - some rasa (juice). In the latter, the=\r\nre is no experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddha is a grea=\r\nt jnaani and his statement is perfect. However, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; who is not at Bud=\r\ndha&#39;s wavelength can easily misunderstand it. If an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; observer exists a=\r\nnd observes &quot;void&quot;, that is different. What we are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; talking about here=\r\n is the absence of observer, i.e. merging of observer,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; observed and t=\r\nhe act of observing into one, without ANY distinction\n&gt; &gt; &gt; whatsoever betw=\r\neen them. Is &quot;void&quot; the right word to describe that state\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or is &quot;ever=\r\nything&quot; the right word? Is there a good way to describe it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Problem i=\r\ns that the word &quot;void&quot; may make people imagine a scenario where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there=\r\n is an observer, but a void to observe.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesson=\r\ns, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homa=\r\nm and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 =C2 =C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n =C2 =C2 =C2=A0 Films that make a difference:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://SaraswatiFilms.o=\r\nrg\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2=A0 Spirituality:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/g=\r\nroup/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 12/29/09, rajarshi n=\r\nandy rajarshi14@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy rajarshi14@\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Su=\r\nbject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Samadhi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Tuesday, December 29, 2009, 1:27 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I understand the example given in that superb mail, yet=\r\n some confusion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; exist (in my understanding) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See=\r\n, Sri Ramakrishna, when he was asked about Nirvikalpa Samadhi said\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he=\r\n cannot describe it in words like the salt doll example provided by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; H=\r\nari.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After all, Rigveda says &quot;ekam sat vipraa bahudha=\r\na vadanti&quot;, which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; means\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Truth is One, but the learned call=\r\n differently&quot; .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; True. Now I see this line in different =\r\nways - 1) As different saints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have mentioned different sadhanas/paths=\r\n to achieve God. 2) Secondly as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; you mentioned, that Truth is One, but=\r\n saints call it differently.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From=C2 from the diamond a=\r\nnalogy I understand that if=C2 X reaches a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; certain face of the diamon=\r\nd and Y reaches another face of the diamond,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they percieve it differe=\r\nntly, thought both faces are the same diamond,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; just different aspects=\r\n. This is OK. This can be equal to savikalpa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; samadhi and may be exper=\r\nienced differently depending upon the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; individual.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Now\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As you break through any face of the diamond\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; and jump into the interior of the diamond, you no longer perceive\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; the faces=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the diamond or the world outside. There are n=\r\no longer any objects\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attributes.=C2=A0 There is no I-nes=\r\ns or It-ness or experience. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; experiencer,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experienced an=\r\nd experience all merge into one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) This seems logical =\r\nand is also the main cause of my confusion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When=C2 we say that we en=\r\nter the middle of the diamond, when duality is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; no more, then how can =\r\nit=C2 be experienced differently by different\n&gt; &gt; &gt; people? Shouldn&#39;t it be=\r\n=C2=A0 the same? I thought, whichever face of teh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; diamond you chose a=\r\ns your entry point, the middle of teh diamond should\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feel and look ex=\r\nactly similar. Please correct me if I am wrong in my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; understanding.=\r\n=C2 =C2 And yet these three spiritual gaints have spoken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; differently =\r\nof their realizations. If duality itself does not exist,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; then how can=\r\n the field of possiblity at all arise? Which means, how can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; there be =\r\na difference in the &quot;perception&quot; of the same One final Truth?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Not to mention the query about whether, that which is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; trans=\r\ncendental in its basic nature (Truth/One/Middle of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; diamond),=C2 c=\r\nan=C2 at all be=C2 described from within the field of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; duality? Then I=\r\n wonder why these three people - saints of highest order\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - try to des=\r\ncribe it when all descriptions are from within duality...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Considering the above, I understand the wisdom (theoritically) of why\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna refused to describe Nirvikalpa Samadhi.=C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; I also wonder whether=C2 the three saints, Sri Ramana Maharishi, Sri\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo and Lord Buddha were speaking from teh same realization of=C2=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the One/Truth, or was it different kinds of realizations. By this I\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mean, can it be possible that there are different intermediate or not=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; properly documented stages of samadhi apart from the standard=C2\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; savikalpa/nirvikalp a/sajaha?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS: I can understand t=\r\nhat maybe Buddha did not mention a void per se,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he probably mentioned=\r\n that there is nothing - for lack of any better\n&gt; &gt; &gt; words -=C2 and stoppe=\r\nd further discussion.

I will broadly classify it in 3 groups:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;(1) Dual=\r\n Realization: One can experience closeness to deities, oneness to deities e=\r\ntc and realize aspects of Self from a dual perspective.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;(2) No=\r\nn-dual Realization: One can merge in non-dual Self. This is Nirvikalpa sama=\r\ndhi.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When one goes to Nirvikalpa samadhi, one may either come =\r\nback and deal with duality again or merge in it forever. If it is the latte=\r\nr, that (i.e. realization of non-dual Self) is the &quot;final realization&quot; for =\r\n*that being*.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;(3) Realization of Non-difference between Dualit=\r\ny and Non-duality: This is what one pursues if one has to deal with duality=\r\n after merging in non-dual Self. This is an open-ended process. Non-duality=\r\n is the simple underlying Truth in all, but its challenge is that it is\n im=\r\nperceptible and reached by subduing I-ness and perception. Duality is perce=\r\nptible, but its challenge is that it has infinite variety and is pursued th=\r\nrough an I-ness and its perception. Keeping an I-ness alive and realizing t=\r\nhe oneness of the two is an infinite process with no single event signaling=\r\n a &quot;perfect&quot; realization. Rishis and deities are pursuing it constantly.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When some gods or rishis are back on earth, they may come back t=\r\no duality after Nirvikalpa samadhi and proceed to deal with the oneness of =\r\nduality or non-dual Self. When some other classes of beings reach Nirvikalp=\r\na samadhi, they do not come back. As Ramakrishna says, this is like a salt =\r\ndoll that goes to survey the depth of the ocean merging in ocean before rea=\r\nching the ocean bed.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One cannot qu=\r\nestion why some characters in one&#39;s dream last for the entire\n dream and so=\r\nme characters last a short time. It is the prerogative of the dreamer. Simi=\r\nlarly, we are all dream objects in Supreme Cosmic Being&#39;s long dream called=\r\n Creation and we cannot question why some beings are meant to merge in non-=\r\ndual self and some are meant to last further.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When Adwaita tea=\r\nches the universe is unreal, it is correct. We are just dream characters. B=\r\nut then, it is also correct that different dream characters have different =\r\nroles to play *within* the dream. Some take part in the dream till the end =\r\nknowing it is a dream. Some exit the dream once they realize it is immateri=\r\nal. Some take part in the dream without knowing it is a dream and become qu=\r\nite worried.

It is a significant step in one&#39;s spiritual evolution, but sti=\r\nll not the ultimate.&quot; - Sadhguru&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; There are vario=\r\nus types of samadhis. For the sake of understanding, samadhis have been cla=\r\nssified into eight forms. Of these eight, they have been broadly categorize=\r\nd as savikalpa and nirvikalpa, samadhis with attributes or qualities and sa=\r\nmadhis without attributes or qualities. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; We see =\r\nwith Isha Yoga, people go into different types of samadhis. Here it is comm=\r\non to witness both savikalpa and nirvikalpa types. Samadhi is a certain sta=\r\nte of equanimity where the intellect goes beyond its normal function of dis=\r\ncrimination. This, in turn, loosens one from his physical body. In samadhi =\r\nstates, one becomes loose inside the body or there is a space between what =\r\nis you and your body. These samadhis, by themselves have no great significa=\r\nnce in terms of\n Realization. Experiencing a certain type of samadhi, does =\r\nnot mean you are released from Existence. It is just a new level of experie=\r\nnce. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; It is like when you were a child, you had =\r\none level of experience, once you moved into your adulthood, you have anoth=\r\ner level of experience. The same things that you have experienced at a part=\r\nicular point in your life, after a few years, you experience them in a tota=\r\nlly different way. So, you have moved from one level of experience to anoth=\r\ner level of experience. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Samadhis are just like =\r\nthis. You are moving from one level of experience to another level of exper=\r\nience in a much more significant and deeper sense. Still, it is just anothe=\r\nr level of experience.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Somebody may go into a ce=\r\nrtain level of samadhi and stay there for years because it is enjoyable. Th=\r\nere is no space or time. There are no bodily problems. He has broken the ph=\r\nysical\n and psychological barriers to some extent. But this is only tempora=\r\nry. The moment he comes out, again he gets hungry, he has to sleep, and aga=\r\nin everything comes back. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Samadhi definitely ha=\r\ns its benefits. There are many things it has to offer for an individual, bu=\r\nt this doesn&#39;t really take you closer to Realization, as such. Compared to =\r\na man who is sober, a man who is slightly drunk, has a different level of e=\r\nxperience, but he has to come down at some point. All samadhis, I would say=\r\n, are a way of getting high without any external chemicals. Now, by going i=\r\nnto these states, it opens up a new dimension for you, but it doesn&#39;t leave=\r\n any great transformation behind. It doesn&#39;t leave you permanently transfor=\r\nmed. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; You have not moved into another reality. I=\r\nn the same reality, your level of experiences has deepened. You have experi=\r\nenced the same things in a little deeper sense. You have not become free\n f=\r\nrom the mind. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Now, somebody meditates for 12 ye=\r\nars and comes out. Even after 12 years, he may not be a realized being, but=\r\n, maybe he is a little closer. When you go into another reality and stay th=\r\nere for long hours or long years, the grip of this reality is broken on you=\r\n. Now, you have come to an experiential understanding that, this is not it.=\r\n Not just an intellectual understanding, you have seen experientially that =\r\nthis is not it. That is the whole purpose of long meditations. But most rea=\r\nlized beings never went into samadhi states. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Ga=\r\nutama never sat for 12 years in one place. Many of his disciples, many Budd=\r\nhist monks went into very long meditations. They never came out for years, =\r\nbut Gautama himself never went, because he saw it is not necessary. &lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; He practiced and experienced all the eight kinds of sa=\r\nmadhis before his enlightenment and he discarded them. He said,\n &quot;This is n=\r\not it&quot;. This is not going to take you any closer to realization. It is just=\r\n moving into a higher level of experience and probably you will get more ca=\r\nught up, because it is more beautiful than the current reality. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If the goal is set, if you&#39;ve made realization the top pri=\r\nority in your life, then every thing else which doesn&#39;t take you one step c=\r\nloser is meaningless. Let&#39;s say you are climbing the Mount Everest, you wil=\r\nl not take one step sideways, because every ounce of energy is needed. Now,=\r\n if you have to transcend your own consciousness, you need every ounce of w=\r\nhat you have and it&#39;s not enough. So, any action that we perform, we don&#39;t =\r\nwant it to be a sidewinder.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; We have created powe=\r\nrful consecrated spaces where experiencing samadhi states comes very natura=\r\nlly. There are samadhis that are very pleasant, blissful, and ecstatic and =\r\nthere are samadhis that are beyond this. Those who go\n into samadhi states =\r\nbeyond pleasant or unpleasant, or nirvikalpa, we always keep them in protec=\r\nted states as their contact with the body has become very minimal. The smal=\r\nlest disturbance, like a sound or a pinprick would dislodge them from their=\r\n body.

If there is no objectification, how can&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; there be any experience or observation? If there is no observat=\r\nion and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; experience, how can you describe Nirvikalpa samad=\r\nhi?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that th=\r\nere is nothing to describe in Nirvikalpa samadhi.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Regardi=\r\nng Nirvikalpa samadhi, Manish\n once said to me: &quot;When I am in&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no experience. Thus, anything I say about=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the &quot;experience&quot; of Nirvikalpa samadhi is actually the o=\r\nbservation of an&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I-ness as it is being torn down or being=\r\n reconstructed, i.e. just before&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; or after Nirvikalpa sama=\r\ndhi but not *during* it.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n This is essentially the problem with &quot;describing&quot; Nirvikalpa samadhi!&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2&=\r\nnbsp; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; =C2&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In terms of the diamond analogy quoted =\r\nby Kishore, what different&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; yogis are saying about the &quot;ex=\r\nperience&quot; of Nirvikalpa samadhi says more&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; about the path =\r\nthey are taking into the inside of the diamond, rather&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\nan describing the inside of the diamond\n itself. One may think &quot;nothing&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; really exists apart from Brahman - all this I am perceiving =\r\nis a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; delusion&quot;. Another may think &quot;all I perceive is actu=\r\nally Brahman&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Another may think &quot;all that I perceive is =\r\nactually a minute part of&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna&quot;. And so on. Once one i=\r\ns able to focus I-ness on a specific&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; thought and everythi=\r\nng else disappears from the mind, one is in samadhi.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Once=\r\n that I-ness also disappears, one is in Nirvikalpa samadhi. However,&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; one can only describe the last thought on which I-ness was focu=\r\nsed prior&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; to Nirvikalpa samadhi and NOT the Nirvikalpa sa=\r\nmadhi itself.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some yogis =\r\nprefer the stage just before Nirvikalpa samadhi where a&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nrace of I-ness is left in an intense focus on one thought, to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Nirvikalpa samadhi itself. In\n the former, there is an experience and&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; bliss - some rasa (juice).

Is &quot;void&quot; the r=\r\night word to describe that state&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; or is &quot;everything&quot; the r=\r\night word?
