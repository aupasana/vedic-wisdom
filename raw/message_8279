True, atma cannot be poluted a=\r\nnd is beyond desires and actions. But most people do not identify with atma=\r\n. They\n identify with a perishable body. So all the talk of &quot;all is atma an=\r\nd atma is pure&quot; is just theory.\n=C2=A0\nAtma is like an ocean in which waves=\r\n and rippes arise and move. Ocean does not get shattered when ripples hit e=\r\nach other and stays the same. But bodies, minds and other perishable object=\r\ns arising in atma are like waves and ripples arising and moving in ocean. T=\r\nhey increase, decrease, get shattered etc. One identifying with the ocean o=\r\nf atma is beyond happiness and sadness. One identifying with the ripple of =\r\na body will experience happiness, sadness etc.\n=C2=A0\nSuppose one is watchi=\r\nng a movie and knows that it is not real and just a movie. Still, when a re=\r\nally scary scene comes, one may be startled. Mere intellectual understandin=\r\ng that it is not real and just a movie, is not enough. It has to be ingrain=\r\ned fully in one&#39;s instincts. Similarly, intellectually knowing that all thi=\r\ns is a play and not real, is not enough. When some really\n pleasurable and =\r\npainful event happens, one WILL identify with the body and experience somet=\r\nhing.\n=C2=A0\nIf Shankara was fully enlightened before that episode (we don&#39;=\r\nt know that for sure), then the action would not have bound him. Otherwise,=\r\n it would&#39;ve created a rina. If he experienced some pleasure, he would crea=\r\nte a new rina to the queen, to various deities (!) who live within one&#39;s co=\r\nnsciousness and operate various parts of one&#39;s body and mind, and to variou=\r\ns beings in his virya who may have been significantly affected. He would ha=\r\nve to pay those debts back later.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThere is not=\r\nhing absolutely sacred or dirty about any action. It is the intent and atti=\r\ntude of the actor that makes an action sacred or dirty. Self-centered actio=\r\nns are more dirty than selfless actions geared at others. More so, the dens=\r\ner and more selfish one&#39;s\n conditioning. \n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n&gt; b=\r\nut knowing this still he performed his rituals for his mother?did he do\n&gt; t=\r\nhis for love or respect or pity or just to balance his runa?\n=C2=A0\nOnly st=\r\nill ocean does not have any ripples or their movement. Similarly only umman=\r\nifest atma (Self after dissolution/pralaya and before new srishti/creation)=\r\n does not have any objects and actions within it. Atma during a srishti cyc=\r\nle does have many objects within it and many actions between them.\n=C2=A0\nT=\r\nhus, realizing Self does NOT mean sitting still in a forest and doing nothi=\r\nng. Various bodies keep doing various actions. A realized person identifies=\r\n with atma and actions by various people seem to him/her like his/her actio=\r\nns. One does not particularly identify with what one&#39;s old body specificall=\r\ny does (based on previous momentum).\n=C2=A0\nNature uses\n such realized peop=\r\nle to set good examples for the world. So they do engage in some actions. T=\r\nhey have no pride or shame, no happiness or sadness and do whatever spontan=\r\neously occurs to them.\n=C2=A0\nShankara performing last rites for mother wou=\r\nld&#39;ve made Mother happy. Moreover, it would set an example for future. One&#39;=\r\ns interaction with the world is give & take. We give things to others and t=\r\nake things from them. True renunciation is in renouncing what we take. Ther=\r\ne is no need to renounce giving. As the prevant notion of sannyasa was to c=\r\nut off from the world, Shankara demonstrated giving others (e.g. mother) sa=\r\nnnyasa.\n=C2=A0\nSwami Vivekananda and Swami Sivananda took this further. The=\r\ny engaged in a lot of service for the society, unlike other sannyasis who l=\r\nock themselves in isolation.\n=C2=A0\nOf course, if the act of &quot;giving&quot; incre=\r\nases pride (i.e. you are &quot;taking&quot; something in return of what you are givin=\r\ng!!!), then a sannyasi\n better isolate oneself from the world and neither g=\r\nive nor take (except absolute essentials for survival). But, when one progr=\r\nesses beyond some level, it is a good idea to &quot;give&quot; what one is in a posit=\r\nion to give others.\n=C2=A0\nThe purpose of life is to give and not to take, =\r\nthough some taking is unavoidable in the process of giving.

As long as one is alive, the force that runs one&#39;s existence creates tho=\r\nughts in the mind. This force is based on the momentum from various notions=\r\n one was exposed to and various desires one entertained, during various liv=\r\nes. It is called &quot;mental conditioning&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nCan it be controlled?

They engaged in a lot of=\r\n service for the society, unlike other sannyasis who lock themselves in iso=\r\nlation.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Of course, if the act of &quot;giving&quot; increases pride (i.e=\r\n. you are &quot;taking&quot; something in return of what you are giving!!!), then a s=\r\nannyasi\n better isolate oneself from the world and neither give nor take (e=\r\nxcept absolute essentials for survival). But, when one progresses beyond so=\r\nme level, it is a good idea to &quot;give&quot; what one is in a position to give oth=\r\ners.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The purpose of life is to give and not to take, though so=\r\nme taking is unavoidable in the process of giving. Focus on what you give a=\r\nnd not on what you take.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; can=\r\n one achieve moksha still in family life&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Yes.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;You=\r\n are still not old enough. Focus on your studies for the next 3-4 years.

As long as one is alive, the force =\r\nthat runs one&#39;s existence creates thoughts in the mind. This force is based=\r\n on the momentum from various notions one was exposed to and various desire=\r\ns one entertained, during various lives. It is called &quot;mental conditioning&quot;=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Can it be controlled? Yes, in the sense that one can add new=\r\n notions and new desires to this driving force and the its direction can be=\r\n slowly refined over time.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Mind is the problem and mind is the=\r\n key to the solution as well. Use mind to change the direction of mind.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;I don&#39;t know about 100%, but I do not know one can modify one&#39;s t=\r\nhinking over time.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;A=\r\nstrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;br&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;,&lt;br&gt;if atma is in us and atma is the part of akhand=\r\na jyoti swaroop[the god-all in one fire form] and the man knew\n that pleasu=\r\nre of the realization like sankara did....&lt;br&gt;if he didnt go to the queen f=\r\nor mere enjoyment of sex ,if he didnt indulge himself mindfully in the deed=\r\n?&amp;enjoy it,he went only for a reason he is not the karman,atma cannot b=\r\ne polluted,realising this sankara went to the queen&amp;thus he is still as=\r\n sacred as ever?&lt;br&gt;but knowing this still he performed his rituals for his=\r\n mother?did he do this for love or respect or pity or just to balance his r=\r\nuna?&lt;br&gt;i have read&#39;&#39;ruaanubandha ruupena pasu patni sutaalayah&quot;did he want=\r\n to balance his runa?or..but still he is a sarvasanghaparityagi...why may h=\r\ne have done it?what may he be telling us through this deed?&lt;br&gt;&lt;deleted&=\r\ngt;&lt;br&gt;[&lt;deleted&gt; can one achieve moksha still in family life if he r=\r\neally realises atman if the above assumption is true..then how can one real=\r\nise atman?is it a feeling or a substratum?what is it made upof?&lt;br&gt;still ia=\r\nm in silly thoughts....ya can man controll his\n thoughts100%?]&lt;br&gt;iam extre=\r\nmely sorry...but...i couldnt resist asking you for &lt;deleted&gt;&lt;br&gt;reall=\r\ny sorry for bothering...&lt;br&gt;namaskaram....&lt;br&gt;good night...&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;&lt;d=\r\neleted&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquot=\r\ne&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--1411505736-1849355759-1338262932=:9589--\r\n\n"}}
