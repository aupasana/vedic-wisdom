The &quot;H&quot; in &quot;naH&quot; is a visarga (written i=\r\nn &gt;Sanskrit as &quot;:&quot; and notated in itrans as &quot;H&quot;). Visarga &gt;means &quot;letting g=\r\no&quot;. You are supposed to let air go from you lungs &gt;in a quick exhalation.\n\n=\r\n&gt; differently in &quot;raamaH&quot;, &quot;hariH&quot; and &quot;guruH&quot;. The same symbol\n&gt; &quot;H&quot; or &quot;:=\r\n&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; in the 3 words, respectively \n&gt; (i.e=\r\n. raamaha, harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If you pronounce it as \n&gt; lettin=\r\ng air go, without adding any vowel, it sounds identical in the 3 \n&gt; words.\n=\r\n\nI had this query in my mind since long time but i didn&#39;t ask you. also in =\r\nthe past, few questions which i wanted to ask you but didn&#39;t has been alway=\r\ns answered by you by means of this forum.\n\nNow coming back to the Visarga -=\r\n \nI was convinced when i read your above paragraph regarding pronunciation =\r\nof Visarga (:, Ha). Technical also it looked correct.\n\nbut when i was recit=\r\ning CP yesterday i was having some doubts which are mentioned below along w=\r\nith some other related queries.\n\n1) I came across Deva Uchu: in the 4th cha=\r\npter. Now i am convinced about DevaaH, RaamaH. IN This two words when you l=\r\net go the air, you can naturally (effortlessly-without affecting the flow) =\r\npronuonce Ha (Not Haa). and i thought it is the same for others but when i =\r\ncame across Uchu:, i was in doubt for the consistency of the rule. What i m=\r\nean here is that when i pronounce Uchu and then let go the air, the natural=\r\n pronunciation seems to be &#39;Hu&#39;. for Uchu--Ha, i have to do some extra effo=\r\nrts. it does not seem natural.\nLikewise for the word, Devaei:, when you let=\r\n go, natural following voice seems to be &#39;Hi..&#39;\nSurprisingly for Dewaa:, Ha=\r\n seems to follow naturally and no need for Haa.\n\n2) More importantly, when =\r\ni recite CP or any other Shlokaas, i have found that, many a times it obstr=\r\nuct the rythm when you try to pronounce Visargaas. Especially when Visarga =\r\ncome in between a shloka. what is the basic purpose of the Visarga in Sansk=\r\nrit language? and what if i avoid some of the Visargaas which obstruct the =\r\nflow?. \n\n\nPlease ignore if these questions are like unnecessary hair splitt=\r\ning analysis because I also feel that way at the moment. But I thought of a=\r\nsking you finally because the topic is relevant and the points I mentioned =\r\nare practically experienced.\n\nYours,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I cannot=\r\n point to any audio that I found satisfactory.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please buy the book &quot;Ma=\r\nntrapushpam&quot; by Ramakrishna Mutt. It gives Gayatri \n&gt; mantra with intonatio=\r\nn marked correctly. It has many other veda mantras too.\n&gt; \n&gt; I will point o=\r\nut a few standard mistakes I have seen people make:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) People normall=\r\ny pronounce anudattas and svaritas (letters with lines \n&gt; below or above) c=\r\norrectly, but mess up when a few udattas come in a row. For \n&gt; example, all=\r\n the three letters in &quot;dheemahi&quot; are without any lines below or \n&gt; above. T=\r\nhey have to be pronounced in the same pitch. People end up \n&gt; introducing s=\r\nome pitch variation and mispronouncing them. In veda mantras, \n&gt; pronouncin=\r\ng all udattas in the same pitch is the most important thing. Do \n&gt; not stre=\r\nss any letter or take the pitch up/down when pronouncing a string of \n&gt; uda=\r\nttas.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) The last syllable of &quot;prachodayaat&quot; is &quot;yaat&quot;. It is suppose=\r\nd to be one \n&gt; syllable. When you pronounce it correctly, &quot;t&quot; is hardly aud=\r\nible. If you \n&gt; artificially add an vowel at the end of it and make it &quot;pra=\r\nchodayaatu&quot;, you \n&gt; will end up introducing an extra syllable (&quot;tu&quot;) and me=\r\nss up everything. A \n&gt; lot of people do not pronounce &quot;t&quot; correctly. Probab=\r\nly some guru sometime \n&gt; back started the practice of adding a brief vowel =\r\nat the end of words ending \n&gt; in a consonant, so that his sishyas could lis=\r\nten clearly what consonant he \n&gt; was saying. Unfortunately, it became a sta=\r\nndard practice. This is good for \n&gt; teaching, but wrong for sadhana. If a w=\r\nord ends in a consonant, end it with \n&gt; a consonant (which cannot be heard =\r\nclearly unless one tried hard) and do NOT \n&gt; add a brief vowel after that c=\r\nonsonant.\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) Take &quot;dhiyo yo naH&quot;. The &quot;H&quot; in &quot;naH&quot; is a visarga (writ=\r\nten in Sanskrit \n&gt; as &quot;:&quot; and notated in itrans as &quot;H&quot;). Visarga means &quot;let=\r\nting go&quot;. You are \n&gt; supposed to let air go from you lungs in a quick exhal=\r\nation. Pronunciation \n&gt; of &quot;naH&quot; is very close to &quot;nah&quot; though slightly dif=\r\nferent. Again, this is \n&gt; supposed to be one syllable. A lot of people, esp=\r\necially south Indians, make \n&gt; it &quot;naha&quot;. Due to extra vowel added (a), an =\r\nextra syllable (ha) is added to \n&gt; the mantra and that messes up everything=\r\n. Again this is wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this style of mispronouncing visarga, the sa=\r\nme symbol &quot;H&quot; is pronounced \n&gt; differently in &quot;raamaH&quot;, &quot;hariH&quot; and &quot;guruH&quot;=\r\n. The same symbol\n&gt; &quot;H&quot; or &quot;:&quot; is pronounced as &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; in the =\r\n3 words, respectively \n&gt; (i.e. raamaha, harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If =\r\nyou pronounce it as \n&gt; letting air go, without adding any vowel, it sounds =\r\nidentical in the 3 \n&gt; words.\n&gt; \n&gt; Watch out for these 3 common mistakes.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; However, as I keep saying, the pronunciation is only a small percentage =\r\nof \n&gt; it. Creating the right mental images and the perfect mental focus is =\r\nmore \n&gt; important. If you lose awareness of your body, successfully shut do=\r\nwn all \n&gt; other thoughts in the mind and achieve a perfect mental focus on =\r\nany veda \n&gt; mantra with correct pronunciation, it will be a fantastic exper=\r\nience. Please \n&gt; note that correct pronunciation is not difficult to achiev=\r\ne, but the other \n&gt; things I mentioned here are not that easy!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best re=\r\ngards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/ho=\r\nmam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish les=\r\nsons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Win=\r\ndows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website:=\r\n http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;sbm_sha=\r\nrma&quot; &lt;sbm_sharma@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesda=\r\ny, June 24, 2009 8:57 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Proper Gayatri Mantra Pr=\r\nonunciation and Intonation - \n&gt; Audio Source\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Could you point me towards any easily obtainable audio recording of the=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Gayatri mantra which you deem to be correctly executed?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also,=\r\n would you mind typing it out here, phonetically?
