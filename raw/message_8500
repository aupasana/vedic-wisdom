Of course, I \n&gt; don&#39;t m=\r\nean to &quot;justify&quot; bad things people may do to you - they may be \n&gt; creating =\r\na bad karma in their own account for future. But we need not \n&gt; worry about=\r\n other people&#39;s accounts. We should worry about our own \n&gt; accounts.\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\nhen somebody does a bad thing to us, a bad entry on our account is \n&gt; taken=\r\n off (&quot;paid back&quot; and hence cut off from the list). When we do \n&gt; something=\r\n good to someone, a good entry is added to our account. Both of \n&gt; these ca=\r\nn be equally useful!\n&gt; \n&gt; When someone has Saturn and Mars transiting in th=\r\ne 8th house from one&#39;s \n&gt; janma Chandra and over one&#39;s janma lagna, honestl=\r\ny far worse things can \n&gt; happen! Somebody becoming angry, thinking of one =\r\nso much (the person in \n&gt; the question replied on JyotishGroup that &quot;Yes I =\r\nhave been thinking of \n&gt; you, NOT every hour, But every moment&quot;) and reflec=\r\nting that anger in a \n&gt; few tens of monolog kind of emails is definitely no=\r\nt the worst thing \n&gt; that can happen.\n&gt; \n&gt; We often get upset with what are=\r\n really good for us and get excited \n&gt; about things that are not so good fo=\r\nr us.\n&gt; \n&gt; One more thing is that someone directing a lot of anger at you c=\r\nan be a \n&gt; good way to test yourself. It is so easy to think that one is in=\r\n a nice \n&gt; equanimous state when there is no provocation. Provocative situa=\r\ntions \n&gt; plainly show us where we are and help us to improve our equanimity=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Reso=\r\nurces: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Sat, Jul 14, 20=\r\n12 at 12:45 PM, Laxmi Narayan wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Narasimha Bhai,\n&gt;           =\r\n                               How are you?
