( i=\r\nn tune if you feel like it)\n\nWith the recent Uttrakhand &quot;tragedy&quot;, a lot of=\r\n questions by pseudo\nintellectuals everywhere were raised. Questions such a=\r\ns &quot; how could\n&#39;god&#39; kill so many devotees ? ; if god is there then how coul=\r\nd this\nhappen? Or is god really this cruel, or does god exist and blah blah=\r\n.&quot;\n\nGod and prosperity don&#39;t always end up in the same equation. Do they?\n\n=\r\nFirst and foremost is a need to understand what this whole suffering\nbusine=\r\nss is all about and then dealing with it. When one is born here on\nthis pla=\r\nnet, there is no &quot;suffering&quot;. As a child you don&#39;t know\njack-shit or even c=\r\nare. If your father passes away, lets say when you\nwere 2, you would not si=\r\ntting in a corner wailing to the world &quot;My\nfather, My Father, My father, go=\r\nd why????&quot; ; like most adults would.\nCount the number of &quot;My&#39;s&quot;.\n\nIf the ca=\r\nr is stolen, you are blissfully still sucking on your toy\nnipple just like =\r\nyou were sucking when your father passed away. You\nwouldn&#39;t go away and sho=\r\nut your ass off in a police station &quot; My car, my\ncar, my car, those fucking=\r\n thieves I&#39;ll kill them.&quot;\n\nCount the my&#39;s again.\n\nIn time &quot;you&quot; grow up and=\r\n start with all these &quot;my&#39;s&quot;.\nMy house, my wife/husband, my child, my money=\r\n, my phone , my investment,\nmy profit and more. Over a period of time you g=\r\not trained that this is\nyou, this yours, that is theirs, behave this way, t=\r\nalk this way, stand\nthis way etc etc etc.\n\nThen all this suffering crept in=\r\n.\n\nFor a human being, suffering comes in the form of --\n\n     =95    Lack o=\r\nf financial resources to satiate desires and need.\n     =95    Loss of some=\r\none close/Death of a loved one\n     =95    Being cheated upon ; because you=\r\n claimed someone as &quot;yours&quot;\nor perceived them to be &quot;yeh toh meri thi, yaa =\r\nyeh toh mera tha&quot;\n     =95    Dreams and aspirations remaining unfulfilled.=\r\n\n     =95    Lack of support from fellow human beings.\n     =95    Partner =\r\nlooted you.\n     =95    Physical disability or some other constraint.\n     =\r\n=95    and a few more scenarios - but not much different from the\nabove.\n\nT=\r\nrue Suffering is you being a turtle, and someone turned you on your\nback, a=\r\nnd you are stuck and want to just stand. It will take you 200\nyears to befo=\r\nre you die and nobody will even stop once to turn you on\nyour legs. Just ki=\r\ndding.\n\nOn an average life expectancy scale, we only live for barely 60 to =\r\n70\nyears, and in that short time frame ,there is so much &quot;suffering&quot;. It is=\r\n\nsuch a convoluted mess, and it is preposterous to say the least.\n\nSufferin=\r\ng is only limited to the surface personality or the body, and is\nlargely ba=\r\nsed on perception. It usually stems from the basic belief of\n&quot;me,mine and m=\r\ne again&quot;.\n\nFor example- if lets say you lose your arm in an accident, you w=\r\nill\nstill be alive and will be able to live your life barring a little\nadju=\r\nstment. Sure there will be something which you won&#39;t be able to\ndo,but then=\r\n you are still alive. This suffering is only limited to the\nbody, because i=\r\nt was going to burn anyways , arm or not. True suffering\nis when the actual=\r\n you &quot;the being&quot; is tortured beyond the body post\ndeath.\n\nWe can&#39;t calculat=\r\ne about anyone&#39;s suffering without actually accessing\nthe subtle body, wher=\r\nein one actually has access to all the shit that\none has done in so many fo=\r\nrms. In short, no debates, no arguments,\nastrologers(most), no nothing can =\r\nanswer the question &quot;why?&quot;, till you\nhave access to your own account of Kar=\r\nmas.\n\nNow the question is why isn&#39;t access given? The law of karma is not a=\r\n\nsimple tit for tat &#39;karma is a bitch&#39; theory in practice and if a\n&quot;being&quot; =\r\nis not sufficiently detached from the current personality, all\nhell can bre=\r\nak loose because more and more self identification with\noccur with previous=\r\n karma&#39;s. To access that account, the level of\ndetachment needed is akin to=\r\n death in the current birth. That only comes\nwith a strenuous amount of pen=\r\nance and wish/will of god.\n\nSuffering is limited to the surface personality=\r\n which is false anyways,\nand all joy, happiness and sadness is related the =\r\npersonality. Thus\nmaking that joy, happiness and sadness also false.\n\nComin=\r\ng to the Uttrakhand Tragedy, a lot of naysayers stated &quot;look what\ngod has d=\r\none, haha we told you there is no god, if god were there,\ncouldn&#39;t he prote=\r\nct all his devotees? Why all the suffering?&quot;\n\nDeath and god are two subject=\r\ns that are one and the same actually, but\nquite a lot of people want god, b=\r\nut don&#39;t wish to die. Sorry doesn&#39;t\nwork like that.\n\nFor the people on the =\r\nground (referring to kedarnath), it was death of\nfellow human beings. We sh=\r\nouted, cursed and abused, because you god, you\nsitting up there, you took e=\r\nverything from us, slam dunked an entire\ntown, killed our fellow beings. Yo=\r\nu killer! And that you killed those\nwho came to worship you.\n\nA fundamental=\r\nly flawed argument.\n\nThe real situation is far different from the one above=\r\n, and cannot be\ndescribed with the view point of the limited self personali=\r\nty. The\ndebates are useless.\n\nGod can always show you that each and everyon=\r\ne of those beings is still\nalive, their personalities are not, their bodies=\r\n are not. But then\nhe/she/it won&#39;t, we don&#39;t deserve to see that.\n\nYou won&#39;=\r\nt buy this if you have lost a family member in there. That is\nbecause &quot;you&quot;=\r\n believe yourself to be &quot;you&quot;, and the attachment to that\nspecific personal=\r\nity, false anyways, is huge.\n\nOne might argue that logic is difficult to ac=\r\ncept and apply, nobody ever\nstated that it was easy. And yes it is incredib=\r\nly difficult, but\neveryone has to pay, and pay you must.\n\nMr Saturn is blam=\r\ned in the most absurd manner worldwide for all the\nmishaps that take place =\r\nwith people.\nShani aya , bhaago, Shani ki maa ki jai, mujhe chorr de please=\r\n.\n\nKyun?\n\nMr Saturn has only one duty, that is to take you back to the\n&quot;sou=\r\nrce&quot;,and for that wether  &quot;you&quot; have to go bankrupt, your valuables\nstolen,=\r\n &quot;you&quot; being ridiculed humiliated, he doesn&#39;t; stop at nothing.\nFor him &quot;yo=\r\nu&quot; can suffer for all you can, he at the end of the day is\nlooking at the r=\r\neal you (only a small light CFL) will thank him.\nEveryone does.\n\nBasic poin=\r\nt is trying to reach god, in the process you lose your current\npersonality =\r\nvia suffering, and then only do you get to meet.\n\nFor Eg - in the Amarnath =\r\nYatra, do you take you car, your flat, your\nentire luggage, your FD&#39;s , lap=\r\ntops and everything else up there? You\nleave it all behind.\n\nSimilarly, dea=\r\nth of your personality is inevitable during this process,\nand suffering is =\r\nthe only payment of your pending dues.\n\nSince we perceive ourselves to be &quot;=\r\nMr X, Ms X&quot; and etc etc, we perceive\nourselves to be suffering.\n\nThere is o=\r\nnly one way out , that is to go above and beyond this\npersonality, and that=\r\n is penance. Get Started today, who knows when the\nreset button is hit and =\r\nyou are back again sucking the nipple and\nrestarting it all over again.\n\nEx=\r\nample---\nLets say your name is  Mr Yakashmai tokoshomoto.\nJust kidding, let=\r\ns say Mr Nexus.(it is an example)\nYou own 10 Crores, 2 flats, one car, smal=\r\nl business, have a settled\nfamily, good looking man, chicks dig you, you ha=\r\nve dealings abroad and\nare blessed with prosperity.\n\n\n    * One day, your 1=\r\n0 crores is taken away by your partners in a fraud\ncase, you aren&#39;t the cul=\r\nprit, but for the time being the court has\nseized assets.  ---- Suffering.\n=\r\n    * Then you get face paralysis, chicks don&#39;t dig you anymore, no easy\nse=\r\nxus for mr nexus  ----- Suffering.\n    * One of your flats is taken over by=\r\n land sharks ---- Suffering.\n    * Your family distances itself from you --=\r\n---- Suffering.\n    * You run to astrologers and start flowing daal in rive=\r\nrs without\nbelieving in it ---- suffering.\n    * Your girlfriend is diagnos=\r\ned with AIDS , woh toh mari, tumhaari\nsexus bhi gayi mr nexus.---- big suff=\r\nering.\n\n(All of this happened over a period of 3 years, itni vaat ikathe ku=\r\nm hi\nlagti hai)\n\nThen one day, you die, while the court case is running, wh=\r\nile all\ndisputes are unresolved, you go away. Your body is not cremated for=\r\n one\nday ,since it was evening when you left, and you know how it is.\n\nYou =\r\nget to meet god, and god actually shows you that you only believed\nyourself=\r\n to be Mr Nexus, you actually aren&#39;t. Then a videotape was\nplayed. Showing =\r\nyou that you earlier incarnated as Jack (Nexus&#39;s\nmother&#39;s dog); Mr Champu (=\r\nservant of your girlfriend&#39;s grandfather);\nvarious chinese people, a seal i=\r\nn the antarctic, a cow , and 598765 more\npeople. Then you are showed , you =\r\ncried then, you suffered then , just\nlike you apparently suffered as Mr Nex=\r\nus.\n\nThen you raised your eyebrow looked at god and all you could say was\n&quot;=\r\nAAU&quot;\n\nGod only nodded in agreement.\n\nAnd then snap you were back, as Mr Nex=\r\nus, but couldn&#39;t breathe. Naak\nmein rui lagi hui thi naa. You got those out=\r\n, threw away that white\nsheet , got off the fatta, your family pissed their=\r\n pants, and you\ndeclared your return.\n\nBut then you remembered what you had=\r\n seen. There was an eternal calm\nabout you, you fought the case without agi=\r\ntation, won back some money,\nbut neither were you happy , nor depressed.\n\nS=\r\nome more losses happened, but you never got disturbed, and people\nstarted c=\r\nalling you a monk, a mad man who is unconcerned , not motivated\nin life and=\r\n yada and yada. But you knew, that since you yourself (as mr\nnexus) are not=\r\n true, and are going to die, what is the use in going mad\nover things? Thin=\r\ngs that are anyways going to go away soon. Things you\nonly believe to be yo=\r\nurs.\n\nThat didn&#39;t you stopped earning, or sat idle, you worked, you worked\n=\r\nyour ass off, but earned in detached manner, and whatever apparent\nsufferin=\r\ng you faced, you accepted it , and never went mad with it. And\nyou worshipe=\r\nd , as much as you could.\n\nSomebody asked you do you remain this way, inspi=\r\nre of all the losses,\nand all you replied with was in the same tone as this=\r\n video, you\nactually sang this out.\n\nhttp://youtu.be/1jIxFbRdFUs?t=3D38s\n\nT=\r\nhen one day you died. And were reborn later as Mr Galaxy S4. LOL, just\nkidd=\r\ning.\n\nFunniest thing would be going to an astrologer and her/him asking wha=\r\nt\nhappened ,and one responding with &quot;mere toh law lag gaye=85..aau&quot;.\n\nSerio=\r\nusly, suffering is solely perception. High level saints are almost\nalways d=\r\nead, surface level personalities are already long gone. And they\ngo through=\r\n the most amount of suffering (usually). They have gone up\nlike Mr Nexus,  =\r\nand come back down as per god&#39;s will. Some don&#39;t come\nback at all, that&#39;s g=\r\nod will too.\n\nGod more often than not doesn&#39;t view us as solely us/humans. =\r\nWe might be\ncribbing about the suffering in Uttrakhand/our personal lives, =\r\nbut\nactually it doesn&#39;t matter from his/her point of view. Because\nhis/her/=\r\nits POV is extremely different and our Percived POV is extremely\ndifferent =\r\nand limited. Thus, the debates and questions are never\nconclusive or answer=\r\nable.\n\nUntil we can see, things from a broader perspective and not a limite=\r\nd\nviewpoint, questions and more questions will be there , which will have\nn=\r\no answers, because truth is essentially extremely different from what\nwe ca=\r\nn see, hear or perceive it is.\n\nTime to retire now,\ntime to sing to god, th=\r\ne lyrics in the following one fit,\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D49Yo4_=\r\n9zNQ8\n&lt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D49Yo4_9zNQ8&gt;\n\nAnd post the above on=\r\ne, you can play this, if you wish to die laughing\nwith devotion -----\nhttp:=\r\n//youtu.be/DASfpntH0sI?t=3D5s &lt;http://youtu.be/DASfpntH0sI?t=3D5s&gt;\n\nJai Mad=\r\name!\n\n\r\n--7-7038591666-6891599149=:5\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&#39;Suffering&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Music for Background -&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;=\r\n_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DRRoYWo3NHxI&quot;&gt;http://www.yo=\r\nutube.com/watch?v=3DRRoYWo3NHxI&lt;/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Advisory - chant.

And yes it is incredibly difficult, but everyon=\r\ne has to pay, and pay you must.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Saturn is blamed in the most absu=\r\nrd manner worldwide for all the mishaps that take place with people.&lt;br&gt;Sha=\r\nni aya , bhaago, Shani ki maa ki jai, mujhe chorr de please.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kyun?&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mr Saturn has only one duty, that is to take you back to the &quot;so=\r\nurce&quot;,and for that wether&nbsp; &quot;you&quot; have to go bankrupt, y=\r\nour valuables stolen, &quot;you&quot; being ridiculed humiliated, he doesn&#39;=\r\nt; stop at nothing. For him &quot;you&quot; can suffer for all you can, he =\r\nat the end of the day is looking at the real you (only a small light CFL) w=\r\nill thank him. Everyone does.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Basic point is trying to reach god, in=\r\n the process you lose your current personality via suffering, and then only=\r\n do you get to meet.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For Eg - in the Amarnath Yatra, do you take you=\r\n car, your flat, your entire luggage, your FD&#39;s , laptops and everything el=\r\nse up there? You leave it all behind.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, death of your perso=\r\nnality is inevitable during this process, and suffering is the only payment=\r\n of your pending dues.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Since we perceive ourselves to be &quot;Mr X,=\r\n Ms X&quot; and etc etc, we perceive ourselves to be suffering.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ther=\r\ne is only one way out , that is to go above and beyond this personality, an=\r\nd that is penance. Get Started today, who knows when the reset button is hi=\r\nt and you are back again sucking the nipple and restarting it all over agai=\r\nn.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Example---&lt;br&gt;Lets say your name is&nbsp; Mr Yakashmai tokoshomot=\r\no.&lt;br&gt;Just kidding, lets say Mr Nexus.(it is an example)&lt;br&gt;You own 10 Cror=\r\nes, 2 flats, one car, small business, have a settled family, good looking m=\r\nan, chicks dig you, you have dealings abroad and are blessed with prosperit=\r\ny.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;ul&gt;&lt;li&gt;One day, your 10 crores is taken away by your partners in=\r\n a fraud case, you aren&#39;t the culprit, but for the time being the court has=\r\n seized assets.&nbsp; ---- Suffering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Then you get face paralysis, =\r\nchicks don&#39;t dig you anymore, no easy sexus for mr nexus&nbsp; ----- Suffer=\r\ning.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;One of your flats is taken over by land sharks ---- Suffering.=\r\n&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your family distances itself from you ------ Suffering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Yo=\r\nu run to astrologers and start flowing daal in rivers without believing in =\r\nit ---- suffering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;li&gt;Your girlfriend is diagnosed with AIDS , woh toh=\r\n mari, tumhaari sexus bhi gayi mr nexus.---- big suffering.&lt;/li&gt;&lt;/ul&gt;&lt;br&gt;(A=\r\nll of this happened over a period of 3 years, itni vaat ikathe kum hi lagti=\r\n hai)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one day, you die, while the court case is running, while =\r\nall disputes are unresolved, you go away. Your body is not cremated for one=\r\n day ,since it was evening when you left, and you know how it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Yo=\r\nu get to meet god, and god actually shows you that you only believed yourse=\r\nlf to be Mr Nexus, you actually aren&#39;t. Then a videotape was played. Showin=\r\ng you that you earlier incarnated as Jack (Nexus&#39;s mother&#39;s dog); Mr Champu=\r\n (servant of your girlfriend&#39;s grandfather); various chinese people, a seal=\r\n in the antarctic, a cow , and 598765 more people. Then you are showed , yo=\r\nu cried then, you suffered then , just like you apparently suffered as Mr N=\r\nexus.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then you raised your eyebrow looked at god and all you could s=\r\nay was &quot;AAU&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;God only nodded in agreement.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And then=\r\n snap you were back, as Mr Nexus, but couldn&#39;t breathe. Naak mein rui lagi =\r\nhui thi naa. You got those out, threw away that white sheet , got off the f=\r\natta, your family pissed their pants, and you declared your return.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nBut then you remembered what you had seen. There was an eternal calm about =\r\nyou, you fought the case without agitation, won back some money, but neithe=\r\nr were you happy , nor depressed.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some more losses happened, but you=\r\n never got disturbed, and people started calling you a monk, a mad man who =\r\nis unconcerned , not motivated in life and yada and yada. But you knew, tha=\r\nt since you yourself (as mr nexus) are not true, and are going to die, what=\r\n is the use in going mad over things? Things that are anyways going to go a=\r\nway soon. Things you only believe to be yours.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;That didn&#39;t you stopp=\r\ned earning, or sat idle, you worked, you worked your ass off, but earned in=\r\n detached manner, and whatever apparent suffering you faced, you accepted i=\r\nt , and never went mad with it. And you worshiped , as much as you could.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;Somebody asked you do you remain this way, inspire of all the losses,=\r\n and all you replied with was in the same tone as this video, you actually =\r\nsang this out.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;http://youtu.be/1jIxFbRdFUs?t=3D38s&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then one d=\r\nay you died. And were reborn later as Mr Galaxy S4. LOL, just kidding.&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Funniest thing would be going to an astrologer and her/him asking what h=\r\nappened ,and one responding with &quot;mere toh law lag gaye=85..aau&quot;.=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Seriously, suffering is solely perception. High level saints are a=\r\nlmost always dead, surface level personalities are already long gone. And t=\r\nhey go through the most amount of suffering (usually). They have gone up li=\r\nke Mr Nexus,&nbsp; and come back down as per god&#39;s will. Some don&#39;t come ba=\r\nck at all, that&#39;s god will too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;God more often than not doesn&#39;t view=\r\n us as solely us/humans. We might be cribbing about the suffering in Uttrak=\r\nhand/our personal lives, but actually it doesn&#39;t matter from his/her point =\r\nof view. Because his/her/its POV is extremely different and our Percived PO=\r\nV is extremely different and limited. Thus, the debates and questions are n=\r\never conclusive or answerable.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Until we can see, things from a broad=\r\ner perspective and not a limited viewpoint, questions and more questions wi=\r\nll be there , which will have no answers, because truth is essentially extr=\r\nemely different from what we can see, hear or perceive it is.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Time t=\r\no retire now,&lt;br&gt;time to sing to god, the lyrics in the following one fit, =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.youtube.co=\r\nm/watch?v=3D49Yo4_9zNQ8&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3D49Yo4_9zNQ8&lt;/a&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;And post the above one, you can play this, if you wish to die l=\r\naughing with devotion -----&lt;br&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://youtu.be/DASfpntH0sI?t=3D5s&quot;&gt;http://youtu.be/DASfpntH0sI?t=3D5s&lt;=\r\n/a&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Jai Madame!&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--7-7038591666-6891599149=:5--\r\n\n"}}
