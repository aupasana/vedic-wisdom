You mean the world of Rajarshi? ;-)&gt;&gt;\n\n=\r\nTrue. But that is why I used a bit of the future continuous tense in my hop=\r\neful assertion:) I don&#39;t think the world at large will let go of the Dasava=\r\ntara idea anytime soon, however the evolutionary link will keep gaining mor=\r\ne ground. Already many seem to think that way. I was watching a TV program =\r\nof a god-man speaking to massive gathering of his followers in an Indian ci=\r\nty and he was actually explaining dasavatara with evolution.\n\nThough this t=\r\nhought came to me independently, I am definitely not the first one, or\n hop=\r\nefully the last one, who finds an evolutionary link in the story of the Das=\r\navataras. Apparently, it was Sri Aurobindo who first wrote about this.\n\n*=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\n&lt;&lt;To give a simplisitc analogy, s=\r\nome jewllery may be gold mixed with some \namount of copper. If one jewllery=\r\n is 100% pure gold, it does not mean it\n contains all the gold in the\n worl=\r\nd. It only means it has nothing other than gold. Similarly, the \nfour poorn=\r\navataras mentioned by Parasara are 100% divine and do not \ncontain jivamsa.=\r\n It does not mean they contain &quot;all the divinity&quot; in \ncosmos.&gt;&gt;\n\nVery beaut=\r\niful analogy! Makes sense.\n\n\n\n&lt;&lt; If no form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being and=\r\n every form is a &quot;subset&quot; of \nsupreme being (like a cloud in sky), what is =\r\nthe meaning of &quot;swayam \nbhagavan&quot;???&gt;&gt;\n\nHmm.. the way *I look at it*, the S=\r\nupreme Being is truly Infinite in every sense, yet when it makes a descent =\r\ninto our plane of material life, it assumes a form, a personality and a=C2=\r\n=A0 character. Now based on the need of THAT desh-kaal, it chooses its spec=\r\nific personality and form, which, to the average consciousness of that peri=\r\nod seems like a fantastic achievement, pushing the limits of imagination to=\r\n the extreme, for that period. And in this light, Krshna is Swayam Bhagawan=\r\n. As if, if G-d were to come down in flesh and blood in fantastic potency f=\r\nor the age that we are living in - it must have been Krshna with his effort=\r\nless and matchless display of the multiple skills, including such extreme D=\r\nivine feats as showing his foster mother the whole universe contained insid=\r\ne his mouth, or making Rishi Markandeya experience the effects of Yogamaya =\r\nwhen he saw this great deluge that ended the world and in the middle of tho=\r\nse turbulent waters, a Divine Child\n was floating in a Banyana-leaf, suckin=\r\ng his own right toe. When the Child sucked Rishi Markandeya inside him thro=\r\nugh his breath, the Rishi perceived infinite number of universes and planet=\r\nary systems within the body of the Child. \n\nRecently I was reading a Tantri=\r\nc scripture. Tara Rahashyam. Among ShaktAs, it is a revered scripture. I fo=\r\nund something interesting. While naturally this being a ShaktA text, the Di=\r\nvine Mother in Her various forms are eulogized as Supreme, it also mentions=\r\n that in Kali, Krshna is Supreme. This explains why only Krshna among the v=\r\narious avatars of Vishnu is worshiped in those parts of India where Tantras=\r\n were the predominant scriptures that were followed. Rama is considered as =\r\na part of Krshna. So along with Krshna nama, Rama nama japa is also done, t=\r\nhough there is no exclusive mass worship of Rama in these parts. \n\nIndia ha=\r\ns so many flavors, that it is almost mind boggling.\n\n\n*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n *\n\nOn many subtle points, your mail was very thought provoking. And I am s=\r\nure I will keep pondering over various hints for quite some time. But one p=\r\noint I want to make about Vedanta. I agree totally with you. \n\nVedanta is t=\r\nhe philosophy, not only of Shankara Adwaitha, but also that of Ramanujachar=\r\nya, Madhavacharya, Chaitanya, Vallavacharya as well as the TantrAs. They ar=\r\ne all Vedantas.\n\nQuite simple put, there are two fundamental states of pure=\r\n consciousness. Static, and dynamic. Purusha and Shakti. The static conscio=\r\nusness is same all around in everything, from the highest Avatara to the lo=\r\nwest stone. But the dynamic aspect of consciousness is NOT same in everythi=\r\nng.\n\nRamakrishna used to say, Kali in present in everyone, but Her Shakti i=\r\ns not same in everyone! This crucial point lies in the heart of Tantric Ved=\r\nanta philosophy. By the process of sadhana, this dynamic aspect of consciou=\r\nsness can be enhanced in an individual. This is the eternal purification of=\r\n individual Chit-Shakti. The purer it is, the stronger it becomes. This als=\r\no accommodates for the idea of vigyana.\n\nThat is why however much sadhana a=\r\n person may do, he/she will never ever attain to the level of a Rama or a K=\r\nrshna. Its practically impossible. The difference is in their levels of ind=\r\nividualized chit-shakti. Or that of a Rishi. Their Chit-Shakit is so powerf=\r\nul, so pure, so free, that it can identify with the Universe and do things =\r\nwhich are impossible to imagine. Which we cannot. Ever.\n\n\nOnce again, wishi=\r\nng everyone a fruitful and auspicious Akshaya Tritiya!\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Raja=\r\nrshi\n\n\n\n\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\nparam bhAwamajAnan=\r\nto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\n________________________________\n From: N=\r\narasimha P.V.R.

It means a completely divine avatara with no=\r\n jivamsa. There can be more than one poornavataras. They are not necessaril=\r\ny &quot;equal&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nTo give a simplisitc analogy, some jewllery may be gold m=\r\nixed with some amount of copper. If one jewllery is 100% pure gold, it does=\r\n not mean\n it contains all the gold in the\n world. It only means it has not=\r\nhing other than gold. Similarly, the four poornavataras mentioned by Parasa=\r\nra are 100% divine and do not contain jivamsa. It does not mean they contai=\r\nn &quot;all the divinity&quot; in cosmos.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIn fact, the=\r\n very notion that any one form can be &quot;the most complete or perfect avatara=\r\n&quot; or &quot;one that personifies entire divinity of Supreme Being&quot; or &quot;one equal =\r\nto Supreme Being&quot; is unacceptable and inconsistent with SB 1.3.30-31, which=\r\n says that ANY form of Supreme Being is like a cloud in the sky, while Supr=\r\neme Being is like the sky containing all possible clouds.\n=C2=A0\nSupreme Be=\r\ning is endowed with infinite qualities. Any form contains a finite number o=\r\nf those qualities. So no form can be &quot;equal to&quot; Supreme Being. SB 1.3.30-31=\r\n is clear in that regard.\n=C2=A0\nIf one form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being an=\r\nd others are\n not, you can conclude that that form is &quot;the best&quot;. If neithe=\r\nr form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being, how can you really compare the differen=\r\nt qualities of two forms?\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nAnyway, this rende=\r\nrs your (3) a meaningless issue. Whether that line refers to Krishna alone =\r\nor not is irrelevant, for, in either case, &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot; cannot mean &quot;a=\r\n personification of the entirety of supreme being&quot;. Before you wonder wheth=\r\ner it refers to Krishna alone or not, first figure out what &quot;swayam bhagava=\r\nn&quot; actually means, in a way that is not inconsistent with verses that follo=\r\nw! If no form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being and every form is a &quot;subset&quot; of s=\r\nupreme being (like a cloud in sky), what is the meaning of &quot;swayam bhagavan=\r\n&quot;???\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nRegarding (4), Parasara\n identified 4 ava=\r\ntaras as 100% divine, with no jivamsa, and identified the source of divinit=\r\ny in each of them. He only gave objective information and did not give any =\r\nsubjective judgment on who is the best, which Suta apparently did.\n=C2=A0\nI=\r\n have not read BV Purana. If you can quote some verses before and after, I =\r\ncan comment. Any comparison between avataras WILL have to be under some sub=\r\njective context. I don&#39;t know the context of Suta&#39;s statement you allude to=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\nThough any comparison is subjective, I will be surprised if someon=\r\ne considers the other two poornavataras of Vishnu as the &quot;best&quot; avataras. B=\r\nut, I will not be surprised if different people consider Rama and Krishna a=\r\ns the most perfect avataras. Sun and Moon are the luminaries and show soul =\r\nand mind, which clearly have a primary significance compared to other aspec=\r\nts of consciousness! So Rama and Krishna are bound to be seen as the best b=\r\ny different people. However, what Suta\n apparently said can only be a subje=\r\nctive view under some context.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nRegarding (2): =\r\nKala means a part or a phase. Moon has 16 phases (representing 16 tithis, i=\r\nncluding Amavasya and Pournima), but Sun has only one phase - he is always =\r\nfull and bright!\n=C2=A0\nJust like Moon, mind has many moods, even a perfect=\r\ned one. A perfected mind goes through those moods with full awareness of un=\r\nderlying reality, whereas an imperfect mind experiences them under delusion=\r\n. But it is the nature of Moon/mind to have variations. Sun/soul OTOH has n=\r\no such variations.\n=C2=A0\nKrishna may show Vishwaroopa oneday, run away fro=\r\nm battlefield another day (e.g. Jarasandha), do amazing miracles oneday and=\r\n play clever tricks another day. There is a lot more variety to his persona=\r\nlity than Rama&#39;s. Now, does that make him better or worse than Rama? Well, =\r\nthat is\n a *subjective* matter.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nRegarding (1=\r\n): Parasara said that paramatmamsa is present in several beings such a plan=\r\nets, Brahma, Shiva, their consorts, etc. Grahas sustain the world appearanc=\r\ne in consciousness by grasping it based on karmaphala. So they stand for di=\r\nfferent qualities of Vishnu that sustain the world appearance. So Vishnu&#39;s =\r\navataras are associated with grahas. But Pararsara said that avataras can d=\r\nescend from the paramatmamsa present in several other beings (e.g. Shiva, P=\r\narvati, Ashwins, Maruts etc). Unfortunately, we have meagre understanding w=\r\nhat various deities stand for, what forces play a role in creating, sustain=\r\ning and destroying the world appearance in consciousness. People talk too m=\r\nuch about Vedanta (end of Veda) and there is hardly any understanding of Ve=\r\nda. When it comes to Puranic stories, we think in terms of\n superficial sto=\r\nries and not in terms of how it maps to what happens in consciousness.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nMohini was an avatara of Vishnu + Maheshwari. Nara & Narayana were inca=\r\nrnations of Narayana (i.e. Brahma + Vishnu + Shiva). I don&#39;t know about Dha=\r\nnvantari and will pass for today. Dattatreya again was an incarnation of Sh=\r\niva + Vishnu + Brahma. Balarama is an incarnation of great serpent Adi Sesh=\r\na (like Lakshmana).\n=C2=A0\nWe need to go deeper into what they all stand fo=\r\nr esoterically and what role they play in the functioning of consciousness,=\r\n to understand this more.

All of them are mentioned as Avataras of the Supr=\r\neme Being in SB.\n&gt;\n&gt;2. What is your opinion about the general stated idea t=\r\nhat only Krshna is 16 kala-poorna and others are not?\n&gt;\n&gt;3. That the SB men=\r\ntions Krshna as Swayam Bhagwan ONLY with respect to the previous sloka wher=\r\ne it says that all rishis, munis etc are also Avataras, is one interpretati=\r\non, and not too popular at that. OTOH, most of the great commentators, and =\r\nthey were no less in their spiritual merit\n or intellectual prowess have ta=\r\nken that specific verse to mean Krshna to be greater than ALL Avataras. The=\r\n verse itself does not mention that it is with respect to the previous vers=\r\ne, or with respect to all the 17 verses that precede it, which lists all Av=\r\nataras. So it boils down to interpretation based on individual conditioning=\r\n. It seems Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, etc all shared a =\r\nsimilar conditioning which made them read that verse to mean that only Krsh=\r\nna is Swayam Bhagwan. Would you agree to this conclusion? :) \n&gt;\n&gt;4. Apparen=\r\ntly in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Suta tells the Rishis of Naimisharanya t=\r\nhat Krshna is greatest Avatara of them all. So, how do we resolve this appa=\r\nrent conflict between what Rishi Parashara states and what this Purana stat=\r\nes?

I am just doing a thinking aloud here. Fee=\r\nl free to disagree :)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Firstly, I feel, the conception of collo=\r\nquially used=C2=A0term=C2=A0Bhagawan as a Superman with unlimited potential=\r\ns way beyond what any normal human being can achieve, came into existence f=\r\nrom the Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krshna as the ultimat=\r\ne God=C2=A0on earth. It is difficult to miss the phonetic=C2=A0similarity b=\r\netween terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from t=\r\nhe Gita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the major purely=C2=\r\n=A0Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimba=\r\nrka, Sri Chaitanya=C2=A0as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earl=\r\niest known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - considered, (with differ=\r\ning nuances on the=C2=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, moksha=C2=A0etc),=\r\n Krshna as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no le=\r\nss a measure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Pur=\r\nana and the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,\n like the Gaudiya=\r\n Vaishnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and=\r\n declared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well=\r\n as Narayana,=C2=A0as merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intrica=\r\ntely linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of =\r\nKrshna, not as a separate Divity in himself.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Whatever the case=\r\n maybe, each school had its own set of established saints and scholars to v=\r\nouch for their views. So it boiled down to interpretation, which is often, =\r\nas you rightly pointed out, based on=C2=A0various conditionings.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;We=C2=A0human beings are creatures of imagination. Whenever an Avatar ap=\r\npears on the earth,=C2=A0most of the great Mahatmas who appear after the Av=\r\natara, remain=C2=A0overawed by the=C2=A0character of the last Avatara=C2=A0=\r\nbecause invariable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those times, th=\r\ne life of the Avatara shows actions performed which are=C2=A0way beyond=C2=\r\n=A0imagination for *those times*. Such a situation continues until the next=\r\n Avatara comes on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and before Krs=\r\nhna, of which we have very little written record, the world at large remain=\r\ned entirely overawed by Rama Avatara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;In this light Krshna is =\r\nthe Poorna-Avatara. When Kalki will appear on earth, he will be invarible a=\r\nccompanied by a set of powerful Rishis - every Avatara comes with his coter=\r\nie of Rishis who explain the philosophy and spirituality of the Avatara to =\r\nthe general masses - who will then create new scriptures and Kalki will be =\r\nlooked at as the crest jewel=C2=A0of the Avataras.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe in the evolutionary parable of these =\r\n9 Avatara because I find no other reason why these set of Avatara, from the=\r\n whole list of possible=C2=A0Avataras, have captured the popular imaginatio=\r\nn. I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB. His spirituality is no le=\r\nss than that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in the list of 9/10 Avata=\r\nras. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;The=C2=A0original Nath Yogis used to consider=C2=A0Nine =\r\nChakras in the Human Body. The idea of Kundalini Yoga also came from them, =\r\nwhich was basically exploring=C2=A0cronologically all these nine chakras on=\r\ne after the other by flooding them with Chit-Shakti.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;There are=\r\n 9 basic grahas in jyotish. Each graha could very well=C2=A0represent the e=\r\nssential nature of each chakra. All these make me more sanguine that there =\r\nmust be Nine Evolutionary Avataras, not ten. In which case Kalki must be th=\r\ne Ninth Avatara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Buddha, as you rightly pointed out,=C2=A0has =\r\na tremendous logical appeal in Kali Yuga. But if logic is the criteria, the=\r\nn why not Adi Shankara? I may not agree to=C2=A0his philosophy as it comes =\r\ndown to us from his followers, but it cannot be denied that=C2=A0Adi Shanka=\r\nra was=C2=A0arguable one of the sharpest and most logical of spiritual phil=\r\nosphers. His intellectual and logical mind=C2=A0is beyond doubt.=C2=A0Just =\r\nthat Shankara=C2=A0never claimed himself to be an Avatara. Neither did=C2=\r\n=A0Siddhartha. Only that the later came 3000 years ago, and the former came=\r\n possibly in the last 1000 years.=C2=A0Shankara&#39;s spiritual impact on the w=\r\norld is no less than that of the=C2=A0Buddha. What mainstream=C2=A0Hinduism=\r\n today is, could not have been, had it not been for the invaluable contribu=\r\ntion of Adi Shankara. And if Buddha was truly=C2=A0the awaited=C2=A09th Ava=\r\ntara of Vishnu, Shankara would not have been able to absorb the philosophy =\r\nof Buddha into Hinduism and thus make it lose its grip on India. Buddhism\n =\r\nbarely exists in land of its birth.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;All this taken together, m=\r\nake me more and more convinced that there are 9 evolutionary Avataras and t=\r\nhe 9th is yet to come.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;A little=\r\n bit about Rama and Krshna. When I said I admire Rama, it is not a lip-serv=\r\nice. There are incidents in the Ramayana which I find extremely inspiring, =\r\neducative and uplifting. Like the incident where Rama was to cross the ocea=\r\nn. Rama knew very well that if he wanted, in one moment he could have used =\r\nhis Divine Astras and forced the ocean to yield way to his army. Yet he sat=\r\n in silent supplication for days, praying that the ocean allow his army saf=\r\ne passage. When all else failed, when genuine goodwill was not recirpocated=\r\n, and it was absolutely necessary to cross the ocean,=C2=A0THEN=C2=A0Rama t=\r\nook up weapons to get the job done.=C2=A0A powerful warrior,=C2=A0who knows=\r\n=C2=A0very well how=C2=A0powerful he=C2=A0himself is, not letting that sens=\r\ne of power pervert his mind even for a moment is an amazing phenomenon. Thi=\r\ns kind of self-control is rare and worthy of comtemplation, specially by an=\r\nyone who feels, ever so slightly, that he/she has some form of power or inf=\r\nluence in\n this world in any sphere.=C2=A0Rama had no malice for anyone. No=\r\nt even Ravana, by the end of the war at least. He was the very personificat=\r\nion of Satwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice and cunningness are impossible.=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Recently, a friend of mine told me that he has learnt all his=\r\n life that one must listen to Krshna&#39;s advice, but only follow what Rama di=\r\nd, and not what Krshna did. I disagree with this vehemently. If one reads e=\r\nntire Krshna&#39;s life=C2=A0with an objective mind, Krshna of Vrndavana, Krshn=\r\na of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jagat Guru who speaks the Gi=\r\nta, one will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced in the Gita,=C2=A0Krshn=\r\na the=C2=A0Divine Worker=C2=A0himself followed it all through his life at e=\r\nvery instance. It is his=C2=A0perfect detachment under all circumstances of=\r\n life, from childhood=C2=A0to his death,=C2=A0that makes me wonder, was thi=\r\ns a man or was this a God? Can a man even do something like this? It is as =\r\nif there is a part of Krshna who is always separate from everything, and si=\r\nlently watches the whole scene with a bemused smile. He had not a single pe=\r\nrsonal stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had his wife abducted for hi=\r\nm to start a war against Ravana.\n But Krshna had zero=C2=A0personal stake i=\r\nn the Mahabharata.=C2=A0After liberating his parents from Kamsa, very soon =\r\nhe went off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhere he forced himself int=\r\no the politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated a great war to cleanse =\r\nthe world of burden. While Lakshmana devoutly followed Rama all along the R=\r\namayana and they were like an inseparable pair, as=C2=A0Balarama in his nex=\r\nt incarnation=C2=A0he could=C2=A0hardly understand Krshna. There are so man=\r\ny occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are they doing with all these=\r\n kings, and=C2=A0that they should=C2=A0return to their village in Vrndavana=\r\n. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone will understand everythi=\r\nng. But that cannot stop him from following his dharma, with perfect detach=\r\nement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false praises, nor wrong accus=\r\nations by his close people can affect him one bit. And I am not even counti=\r\nng the miracles he perfromed as a Divine Child. So I\n worship Krshna, becau=\r\nse I have not yet met or heard of read of=C2=A0a single sadhaka or saint or=\r\n ordinary man or mahatma=C2=A0who has displayed this kind of perfected deta=\r\nchment through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing from the world or active=\r\nly performing a larger dharma.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I started appreciating Swami Vi=\r\nvekanada more after I understood a bit of the Krshna Avatara.

If people at the beginning of Satya yuga are=\r\n established in Self always and the only issue is that a small attachment m=\r\nay develop now and then, disturbing that state of being established in Self=\r\n (i.e. stealing of Veda!), then the aspect of consciousness that is relevan=\r\nt is &quot;spirit of detachment&quot; (Ketu). If invoked, it removes that attachment =\r\nand takes one back to being established in Self. So an avatara correspondin=\r\ng to Ketu occurred.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;As collective consciousness became denser,=\r\n being established in Self became less natural and more effort was needed. =\r\nSo the &quot;spirit of patience, persistence and\n hard-work&quot; (Saturn) became rel=\r\nevant and an avatara corresponding to Saturn occurred. And so on.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;In the dark ages of Kali yuga, rational minds wouldn&#39;t accept anything =\r\nthat didn&#39;t &quot;make sense&quot;. Being established in Self became an unnatural, ri=\r\ndiculous and incomprehensible notion. So the &quot;spirit of comprehension&quot; (Mer=\r\ncury) became relevant. An avatara corresponding to Mercury occurred and tri=\r\ned to explain being established in Self as a comprehensible notion, so that=\r\n rational minds of that age would accept it to an extent and attempt it.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Avataras occur based on the needs of collective consciousness. O=\r\nf course, if one&#39;s consciousness is in a different state from the collectiv=\r\ne consciousness of that time, the current avatara may not be relevant to on=\r\ne.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I respect Rama, but I worsh=\r\nip Krshna.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;I am\n awestruck by Krishna and worship him, but I s=\r\nee Rama as an ideal that I MAY be able to emulate oneday.

It lists 22 Avataras! It=C2=A0deals with the idea of Avat=\r\naran, but not with the idea of 9/10 fixed Avataras.=C2=A0It also=C2=A0lists=\r\n Varaha Avatara as the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya as the 10 in its list of 22.=\r\n It is only in other puranas, that we get the focus on 10 Avatars, and the =\r\nterm becomes popular. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;And ONLY when we take these 9/10 Avat=\r\naras, in a fixed sequence=C2=A0of appearence, that we get the popular conce=\r\npt of Dasavatara.

Infact, in the 10th Chapter of Gita =\r\nwhen the Supreme explains the various vibhutis, this One is not even Krshna=\r\n, but has transcended every limitation of conception. Hence, the One says, =\r\namong those who weild weapons, it is Rama, and among the Vrishnis it is Krs=\r\nhna! Etc..\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;First, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras a=\r\ns well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutio=\r\nnary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps=\r\n not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As I said, the SB list cont=\r\nains 22 Avataras. It does not focus on the idea of 9/10 Avataras! That is m=\r\ny point. If you take 22 Avataras, then these link to grahas are not of any =\r\nuse. For these nine grahas, individually or in combination, will represent =\r\nall Avataras, or for that matter everything else in this Universe.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, if we take 10 Avatars and corresponding grahas for each, =\r\nthen what must Kalki be? Lagna? But=C2=A0lagna is not a graha.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;Or, just surmising, can it be possible that until an Avatara actually de=\r\nscends on the earth, his energy and his force cannot be attributed to any g=\r\nraha, but once he does appear, it reconfigures things completely? We can on=\r\nly know after the last Avatara comes.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, I am not looki=\r\nng at this main Avatars from the point of grahas/jyotish at all.

In fact, Parasara, fath=\r\ner of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varaha =\r\nare &quot;poornavataras&quot; (used that exact expression) while other avataras have =\r\nsome amount of jivatmamsa too (though paramatmamsa dominates\n jivatmamsa).\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, after describing the avataras, SB says that there =\r\nare in fact innumerable avataras and that all rishis, munis, manus, demigod=\r\ns etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.28 th=\r\nen proceeds to say &quot;these avataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord Himse=\r\nlf.&quot; I question if the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself and R=\r\nama is not is accurate! It only seems to say that all these rishis, manus, =\r\ndemigods etc are partial. As I said above, Pararsara explicitly said that b=\r\noth Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Third, let us ask a =\r\nvery fundamental question: What exactly does it mean if an avatara is &quot;Lord=\r\n Himself&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;While SB talks of =\r\nKrishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: &quot;forms of S=\r\nupreme Lord, who is in reality formless (arUpa) and of the\n nature of pure =\r\nconsciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualities of Maya&quot;. In t=\r\nhe next verse, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds in sky and dirt =\r\nin air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, similarly Lord *c=\r\nontains* forms and is beyond them. So, again, what is the meaning of a spec=\r\nific form that descended on earth being &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I am afraid people =\r\nmay be misinterpreting this notion based on their fancies and conditioning.=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All beings are made up of paramatma (supreme/absolute bein=\r\ng) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latter portion is dominant in u=\r\ns and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Great avataras descend from a=\r\n higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras descend entirely from pa=\r\nramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna are specific examples=\r\n given by Parasara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are entirely divine, but they do no=\r\nt encapsulate the entire divinity!!!! After all, &quot;entire\n divinity&quot; cannot =\r\nbe encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can contain the entire sky. Th=\r\ney take part in the drama obeying and executing the divine will but NOT alt=\r\nering it. This applies to Krishna as well as Rama.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. B=\r\nut I do not\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; realization, the one he advocated, is a static realization,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an en=\r\nd in a void.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;First, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras a=\r\ns well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutio=\r\nnary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps=\r\n not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, as per Parasa=\r\nra, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies logical mind and the spi=\r\nrit of investigation and comprehension. Logical mind\n and its spirit of com=\r\nprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfected spirit of comprehensio=\r\nn is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality completely, for it is bey=\r\nond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the Incomprehensible in an a=\r\nttempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up doing. However, logical =\r\nmind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in this Kali yuga. No wonder B=\r\nuddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in this world in this age.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If you dismiss Parasara&#39;s linking=\r\n of planets to avataras as a possible corruption, are you absolutely sure t=\r\nhat the verses of SB you are relying on are perfect?

The =\r\nnature of each aspect of consciousness (e.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehensi=\r\non, Saturn - spirit of patience & persistence, Venus - spirit of happiness =\r\netc) and the story of corresponding avatara DOES have a highly meaningful c=\r\nonnection, esoterically speaking. After all, esoterically is how you really=\r\n need to understand any higher scriptures and notions in them.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;If we take scriptures literally instead and draw lopsided conclusions, s=\r\nome would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;i=\r\nnferior&quot;; some would conclude that Surya is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other dei=\r\nties are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;On a different note, someone may think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superi=\r\nor\n to Tara and like Kali more. But, some learned yogis have declared them =\r\nto be essentially the same and some scriptures even prohibited differentiat=\r\ning between them. As I see it, the difference between them is too subtle fo=\r\nr even rishis to clearly comprehend. People seeing some significant differe=\r\nnce between them are, I am afraid, merely projecting their own conditioning=\r\n. Same in the case of Krishna and Rama. Both were=C2=A0 perfectly detached =\r\nand fully divine karma yogis.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we think about it, perfecte=\r\nd mind (paramatma aspect represented by Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect re=\r\npresented by Sun) are not really that different. So I am afraid Krishna and=\r\n Rama are not that different, though the specifics of their stories may be =\r\ndifferent.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;One last word though. If someone truly believes t=\r\nhat Krishna is superior to Rama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I am=\r\n very happy for such a person. My arguments are more for the sake of sharin=\r\ng thinking/knowledge and pushing the boundaries of understanding in the lon=\r\ng run, than changing the minds of anyone in the short run. In the end, ever=\r\nyone of us will have to go through one&#39;s own cycles of various tamasik, raj=\r\nasik and saattwik stages of evolution before one starts grasping some fistf=\r\nuls of Reality.

Let me write down as I see it, in point by point manner.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vish=\r\nnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is th=\r\ne 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this li=\r\nst, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vis=\r\nhnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and i=\r\nnnumerable others, are amsas of the Supreme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam B=\r\nhagawan.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Of these various possible Avataras, 10, or ra=\r\nther 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded special mention and significanc=\r\ne across various Hindu spiritual literature, specially those which were com=\r\nposed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, it was K=\r\nali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed the full effect of Kali,on=\r\nce he left his body, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas were composed a=\r\nfter this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance. M=\r\natysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha=\r\n) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form and sequence =\r\nof these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aquatic=\r\n, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the=\r\n dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes possession of this =\r\nearth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashur=\r\nama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the N=\r\nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not to =\r\nbe separated into another world, but is a progressive realization of the va=\r\nrious manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousness a=\r\nnd its development through various life-forms. Larger spirituality of earth=\r\n and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s grand design for life on\n =\r\nearth.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on t=\r\nhe parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one =\r\nworships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation o=\r\nf the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata=\r\n can lead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars=\r\n of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider super-mas=\r\nsive spiritual dynamos.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A05. Of these, naturally=\r\n, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they represent a stage of evoluti=\r\non, both inside as well as outside, which society can relate of much easier=\r\n, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic mind. A sa=\r\ntwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to transform the animal ten=\r\ndencies within and without - monkeys - into a constructive force for a grea=\r\nter purpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there can be ins=\r\ntances, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature and will =\r\nchange only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ramayana, Ra=\r\nma did feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He did have a =\r\nmoments fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispelled by Ags=\r\natha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At the end of t=\r\nhe final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner, that he k=\r\nilled Ravana not to rescue her, but it\n was the Dharma to do so, and to unh=\r\nold his family honour. That too was the dharma of that age when he lived, f=\r\namily honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly to the gen=\r\nius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as a scribe,=\r\n as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferences to it anywhe=\r\nre, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminated into hi=\r\ns killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, such that =\r\nno personal consideration or emotions or passions can overturn the Rajadhar=\r\nma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, OTOH, had t=\r\nhis immaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=C2=A0 super=\r\nnatural feats into account. It is his singular and constant detachment from=\r\n situations, from people, from environment, from circumstances that mark hi=\r\ns life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for Mathura. Al=\r\nl his friends, his foster parents,\n his village-folks who so loved him, ple=\r\naded with him that it would make no sense for him to leave the shelter, lov=\r\ne and comfort of his happy, settled village life and head into an unknown d=\r\nestiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then he understoo=\r\nd that they won&#39;t understand, he promised he will return back once his work=\r\n in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, when the Gopis c=\r\name to him asking him to participate in their dance, he obliged. But the mo=\r\nment some of them started getting jealous and possessive of Krshna, he remo=\r\nved himself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to everyone equa=\r\nlly and no one has any special right over him. When Shishupala abused Krshn=\r\na, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling and countin=\r\ng. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shishupala&#39;s hea=\r\nd and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly accused Krshna=\r\n of being a revolutionist\n and charlatan, Krshna did not kill him. When Dur=\r\nyodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black magician, wanted to a=\r\nrrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of kings, yet h=\r\ne did not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he was back into his=\r\n own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one instance of h=\r\nis going overboard, never a single shade of depression, equivocation, or la=\r\nck of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what others say or think o=\r\nf him. And then right in the middle of the greatest war he had the perfect =\r\nequipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. That is why his=\r\n life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yogi by defini=\r\ntion can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the action nor the re=\r\nsults belong to the instrument. When running away from the battle-field and=\r\n killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart Jarashanda, o=\r\nr gesturing Bheema\n to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getting Shikhandi=\r\n to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew exactly how t=\r\nhe situations must be lined up which would cause the destruction of these p=\r\neople. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational thinking. But hap=\r\npens when one is constantly and consciously connected to the Universal Forc=\r\ne. We do not find these kind of complex situations in the Rama Avatara, at =\r\nleast in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut Ramayana or=\r\n such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a different picture. In =\r\nthe Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama after he ki=\r\nlls Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes the 1000 he=\r\naded demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the Ramayana and the =\r\nMahabharata, the picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is the embodiment=\r\n of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great characteristics of sa=\r\ntwa, chief\n of which is self-control, as well as the occasional sadness cau=\r\nsed due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least until Ravana was de=\r\nstroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint, but can als=\r\no cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna was gunatita. He ha=\r\nd no attachment to anything in this world - man, women, deva, danava, frien=\r\nd, enemy - and therefore he was never affected any trace of negative emotio=\r\nn. His Ananda never left him even in the most trying situations. 6. Buddha =\r\nwas great spiritual force in this world. But I do not see him fit in the sc=\r\nheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realization, the one he advocated, is a s=\r\ntatic realization, an end in a void. This is clearly denying of the reality=\r\n of this earth. I find this not in tune with what either Rama or Krshna esp=\r\noused. None of them negated this world. If negation of this world and life =\r\nis the final aim, then why send so many avatars at crucial stages of\n evolu=\r\ntionary development? If the spiritual impact on masses is the reason for Bu=\r\nddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less=\r\n impactful in that sense. But do they fit in the scheme of spiritual line t=\r\nhat these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in a most logical manner? No. As =\r\nsuch many vaishnava traditions in parts of India, do not consider Buddha to=\r\n be an avatara. Realization, to be complete and holistic, must be both stat=\r\nic and dynamic, outside of life as well as inside of life. That is why the =\r\nTantras formed their own kind of spiritual philosophy, of the world as body=\r\n of Shakti and therefore an object of reverence and realization. 7. The ori=\r\nginal literature of the Nath Yogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are cen=\r\nters of psychological functions. 6 inside the human body and 3 too subtle, =\r\nor non-developed in most people, even seekers. It is my belief that each of=\r\n the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - correspond to the full\n power and forc=\r\ne of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can mod=\r\nify consciousness or allow the consciousness to explore and express itself =\r\nis various possiblities, are 9 in number. The lagna is a reference point an=\r\nd not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars who represent the parable of evo=\r\nlution are nine in number. And the ninth of the sequence is yet to come. 8.=\r\n I cannot comment on which graha would typically represent which Avatara. I=\r\n know of what the BPHS says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagr=\r\nee with it -:)[one cannot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understan=\r\nding or textual misrepresen\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
