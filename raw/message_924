You mentioned that you always considered Ma Lakshmi a=\r\ns you \nIstha Devata.\n\nNow what I was wondering about it that, is it possibl=\r\ne that for a \nperson to get closer to his/her Istha, he/she may have to und=\r\ner go \nserious sadhana of some other deity?\n\nLike in your case you have don=\r\ne so many homas for Ma Chandi, so does \nit mean Ma Chandi is your Istha dev=\r\nata? \n\nOr does it mean Ma Lakshmi wanted you to do these sadhanas so that \n=\r\nyou can progress faster, maybe you had done a lot of sadhana for Ma \nChandi=\r\n in previous lives?\n\nKindly tell us your views on this.\n\n-Regards\n Rajarshi=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
