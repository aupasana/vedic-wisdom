I live at Alipore which is quiet close to famous Kali =\r\ntemple. I have a humble plan which I want to share with you. If some of you=\r\n are staying in/ around Calcutta, then we can think of assembling at some c=\r\nonvenient place and start hawan in group(with separate hawan kund). we can =\r\ndo it periodiacily say on weekends.=A0It is nice that we interact with each=\r\n other online and share spritual knowledge and clear our doubts, but it wou=\r\nld be much better if we can assemble at one place to do a hawan. the energy=\r\n of the collective action should be manyfold and it=A0should benefit all.=\r\n=A0further we can learn from each other. \nIf you notice Muslims and Ghristi=\r\nans, they pray to God at a common time and place in a group. While, we Hind=\r\nus seperately visit our temples. May be, thats why their numbers are increa=\r\nsing while proportanately ours numbers are decereasing. I just wanted to em=\r\nphasize the importance organising for spritual upliftment. I have no ill fe=\r\nelings against anyone. \nIt might have happened in some age that one raam ha=\r\nd defeated one ravana. But in this age ravana(kaam, krodh,loabh,..) are ver=\r\ny powerful and therefore we need to act collectively. \nI have known that th=\r\nere=A0some group doing=A0hawan collectively at Bombay.=A0Similarly, we can =\r\nstart at calcutta, the place of sri Ramkrishna.=A0=A0\n=A0\nFurther, I have a=\r\n doubt regarding procedure of hawan. I have noticed in the downloaded vedio=\r\n of Ganapati Hawan that the offering(ghee/coconut peices) are put in the fi=\r\nre while saying swaha( sometimes it appers in the vedio that the offering i=\r\ns put in fire after the mantra is complere and before swaha). I want to kno=\r\nw if the offering should go in the fire after the mantra is complete(before=\r\n swaha), or while saying swaha, or after the mantra and swaha is complete.w=\r\nhen should it leave our fingers?=A0I had earlier put up this question and w=\r\nhat I understood from Sri Ananda Kishora&#39;s reply is that the offering is=A0=\r\nto be made to=A0the fire after the mantra chanting with swaha is complete. =\r\nBut this vedio has created a doubt. Kindly Clarify.\n=A0\nNow a days=A0 few y=\r\nogacharyas advocate that while doing pranayama the air has to be filled in =\r\nlungs and not stomach(i.e. the stomach should not bulge). But another group=\r\n says that air should fill both lungs and stomach(both stomach and lungs sh=\r\nould come out). What according to you is the correct procedure of pranayam?=\r\n\n=A0\nWaiting for your reply.\n=A0\nThanking you \n=A0\nNawal=A0\r\n--159414938-1776210206-1330343532=:9914\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Dear &lt;SPAN&gt;Friends&lt;/SPAN&gt;,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;( =\r\nSri Narshma, Ananda Kishora and others)&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I have recently sh=\r\nifted in Calcutta.
