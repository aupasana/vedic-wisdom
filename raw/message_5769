That is why one may feel sluggish after a heavy \nmeal. As less energy is available for digestion of ideas in brain, one&#39;s \nintellectual alertness may be lower. Similarly, less agni is available \nfor spiritual transformation in the subtle body, which is needed for \nreworking one&#39;s karma pipeline and obstacles in the subtle body. Thus, \nmeditation done on a heavy stomach is ineffective.\n\nIf one fasts, more agni is available for that purpose. Thus, meditation \nafter fasting can be effective. If one meditates with a mantra after \nfasting, the internal agni causes some spiritual transformation. Over \ntime, it may rework the karma pipeline enough to remove a blocking karma \nfrom the head of the pipeline, to cause a blocked event to occur. When \none focuses mind on a mantra and couples it with the force of a \nreasonably dhaarmik desire (e.g. getting married, getting a child, doing \nwell in career etc), then some momentum is created to remove blocking \nkarmas or atleast re-arrange karmas.\n\n*        *        *\n\nTechnicalities are there to optimize the sadhana, but not to block one \nfrom sadhana. In fact, technicalities play a very minor role and \nmoreover our understanding of many of them may very well be wrong! The \nkey is to have mental focus and surrender to the Lord. It is the \nmeditation done at the end of fasting that is the key. Do it with as \nintense a focus as you can mutter.\n\n*        *        *\n\nBTW, people with pitta and vaata constitutions should ideally not fast. \nThey will end up aggravating pitta and vaata and the physical system is \ndestabilized. To sustain spiritual transformation over time, physical \nwell-being is also needed/useful. So do not push yourself. The goal of \nfasting is not to punish yourself so that someone in the sky becomes \nhappy (nope, god is not a sadist) and grants you what you want. The goal \nof fasting is to create a situation where internal agni can work on your \nkaarmik blockages and rework the kaarmik pipeline enough. This is \nessentially an internal process happening in the subtle body and \nwell-being of the gross physical body is also useful for supporting it.\n\nSo, for many people, partial fasting may be better than complete \nfasting. Take fruits and milk, which are easier to digest and are \nsaattwik. Stay away from spices, fried things, meat and other complex \nfoods. Sour fruits like oranges are a bad idea and take sweet fruits \nsuch as dates, bananas, sweet apples etc. In general, eat as little as \nyou can, just to sustain yourself, and think of god during the whole day \nwhile doing other things. In the end, meditate as intensely as you can. \nThat is how fasting can be effective.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n--- In vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, &quot;prasaathsjob&quot; \n&lt;prasaathsjob@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In one of the article you said for career improvement one needs to \n&gt; fast on the day indicated by A10, But it is also associated with\n&gt; A9 and A8. if one do fasting on the day of A8 will it give any \n&gt; negative effects.
