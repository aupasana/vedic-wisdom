Moreover, when \nI see the happenings in the world and how dharma is deteriorating compared \nto even a few hundred years back, I cannot think that anything other than \nKali yuga is running right now.

This is regarding the metion of Sri Yukteshwar\n&gt; Giris calculations of the yugas.\n&gt;\n&gt; Firstly let me clarify that I personally am no vedic scholar, nor\n&gt; can I read sanskrit. So I really have no idea of what or who is\n&gt; right. But I had the good fortune of reading the book &quot;The Holy\n&gt; Science&quot; where he refers to this calcuation of yugas. Now you must\n&gt; have read in th autobiography of a yogi that Sri Lahiri Mahasaya had\n&gt; instructed Sri Yukteshwar Giri to go to the Kumb Mela so that he\n&gt; could meet the Mahamauni. And later after Sri Yukteshwar Giri\n&gt; Maharaj had completed his book, that very day he met the Mahamauni\n&gt; who was sitting under a tree with his disciples. Infact the incident\n&gt; goes this way that as the Mahamauni had promised Yukteshwar Giri\n&gt; that he would meet him once the book get written. So as Sri\n&gt; Yukteshwar Giri was passing by in the morning to take a bath\n&gt; suddenly he finds the Mahamauni with his disciples under a tree. And\n&gt; the first thing that the Mahamauni tells Sri Yukteshwar giri is to\n&gt; to bring perfection in his vision by increasing his meditation\n&gt; because had he done so he should have been able to see Him(the\n&gt; Mahamauni) and his disciple inside the sunlight. Anyway that is\n&gt; beside the point.\n&gt; What I was wondering is that, if the calculation of yugas as given\n&gt; by Sri Yukteshwar is wrong then that means even the Mahamauni Babaji\n&gt; blessing the book and meeting him in kumb and again later is also\n&gt; wrong. I mean all these people are way way way way ahead of me, but\n&gt; even among them Mahamauni is just not another sadhaka or a yogi. He\n&gt; is the Babaji. As Lahiri Mahasay mentions in his dairy.&quot;budhe babai\n&gt; kisun hai&quot;.. Lahiri Mahasay used to refer to Babaji as budhe baba.\n&gt; And Kisun was Krishna. To think that, THAT supersoul specifically\n&gt; blessing a book written by a great yogi actually contains wrong\n&gt; calcuation becomes a little difficult to comprehend.\n&gt; I of my own have no knowledge or learning to be able to decide what\n&gt; is right and what is not. I just voiced a concern of mine from the\n&gt; point of view of an ordinary individual who considers the Mahamauni\n&gt; to be one with God himself. If He is can make such a mistake, then\n&gt; God is not really that omnipotent I guess.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

They are arranged in their\n&gt; current form by\n&gt;&gt; Vyasa about 5,000 years back. But they were revealed to rishis\n&gt; millions of\n&gt;&gt; years back. Yogis have been meditating on verses from Vedas and\n&gt; realizing\n&gt;&gt; universal truths represented by them for millions of years.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -Why most of the Darshans are also few thousand years old, wasnt\n&gt; there\n&gt;&gt; &gt; any philosophy before that?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The modern chronology of Hindu scriptures was created by people\n&gt; with heavy\n&gt;&gt; biases and agendas. Darshanas are not a few thousand of years old.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We had Veda(s), vedanta, vedangas, darshanas etc for millions of\n&gt; years.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -What is the divison of the ages(yugas). Again there is a lot of\n&gt;&gt; &gt; confusion here as some say they are thousands of years long but\n&gt; others\n&gt;&gt; &gt; say millions of years long. Can you please explain it.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Krita/Sat yuga is 1,728,000 years long. Treta yuga is 1,296,000\n&gt; years long.\n&gt;&gt; Dwapara yuga is 864,000 years long. Current Kali yuga started\n&gt; about 5,000\n&gt;&gt; years back and it is 432,000 years long.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yukeshwar maharaj (guru of Paramahamsa Yogananda) took a different\n&gt; view,\n&gt;&gt; where all the above numbers are divided by 360. He is a great yogi\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; belongs to a great lineage and I have the highest respect. But he\n&gt; is simply\n&gt;&gt; wrong on this. A yogi can experience all times and spaces. In\n&gt; fact, time is\n&gt;&gt; a very weird concept, even though it seems natural to us when we\n&gt; are\n&gt;&gt; completely bound to this body in this particular space-time\n&gt; continuum. When\n&gt;&gt; a yogi enters nirvikalpa samadhi, there is no space and time for\n&gt; him/her.\n&gt;&gt; The space-time continuum experienced by a yogi in different realms\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; consciousness are different. I submit that Yukteshwar Maharaj made\n&gt; some\n&gt;&gt; mistake, either intentionally or unintentionally, in drawing\n&gt; conclusions\n&gt;&gt; from his experiences.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Traditionally, we mention the number of years that passed since\n&gt; Kali yuga\n&gt;&gt; started, at the start of every ritual. The number mentioned (about\n&gt; 5,000\n&gt;&gt; years) matches with the astronomical dating of Mahabharata. All\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; astronomical combinations mentioned by Vyasa in Mahabharata\n&gt; occurred in that\n&gt;&gt; sequence in a consistent manner about 5,000 years back. There were\n&gt; tens of\n&gt;&gt; those eventsand they occurred in that sequence only once in the\n&gt; last 7,400\n&gt;&gt; years. For sure, Krishna lived about 5,000 years back and Kali\n&gt; yuga started\n&gt;&gt; then.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -You advised me to worship Lord Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar\n&gt; incarnation).\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Can you please explain if this is an allegory/metaphor or a real\n&gt; story\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and is there any special method to worship Varaha incarnation.\n&gt; Also\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can you please illustrate the meaning of the form of Vishnu.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; All the stories of Puranas are metaphors of some internal\n&gt; happenings and\n&gt;&gt; also real stories at the same time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Each of is a microcosm of the entire universe. Thus, macro events\n&gt; described\n&gt;&gt; in scriptures happen microcosmically inside us. It is equally\n&gt; valid to see\n&gt;&gt; them as real stories and as metaphors. When one&#39;s self-\n&gt; consciousness ascends\n&gt;&gt; to a particular realm of consciousness, it is actually possible to\n&gt; see one\n&gt;&gt; of these stories actually happening. In our normal realm of\n&gt; consciousness,\n&gt;&gt; these are just stories and we can only understand them\n&gt; intellectually.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There are Jupiter, his wife Tara, Moon and Mercury externally.\n&gt; Internally,\n&gt;&gt; they represent the intelligence, the expression of intelligence,\n&gt; mind and\n&gt;&gt; learning ability (respectively). The story of Jupiter&#39;s wife Tara\n&gt; begetting\n&gt;&gt; a child (Mercury) through Moon is real. It is also a metaphor for\n&gt; the fact\n&gt;&gt; that internally, mind combines with the expression of intelligence\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; generate learning ability.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regarding Varaha avatara, here is my view. Hiranya means gold and\n&gt; also\n&gt;&gt; great. Aksha has many meanings, but one of them is &quot;sense organs&quot;.\n&gt; The demon\n&gt;&gt; Hiranyaksha symbolizes the mighty sense organs. He stole Mother\n&gt; earth and\n&gt;&gt; sunk Her in water. Mother earth is symbolized by Kundalini\n&gt;&gt; (self-consciousness, microcosmic representation of the divine\n&gt; Mother within\n&gt;&gt; each person) who is normally in the Mooladhara chakra (earth\n&gt; element). When\n&gt;&gt; a sadhaka is caught by the mighty sense organs, Kundalini\n&gt;&gt; (self-consciousness) is stuck in the samsara saagara (the ocean of\n&gt; material\n&gt;&gt; life) and loses balance. Lord Vishnu (sattwa guna in a person)\n&gt; takes the\n&gt;&gt; form of a boar and comes from the nostril of the creator. He digs\n&gt; in and\n&gt;&gt; rescues earth from Hiranyaksha. When sattwa guna enters the praana\n&gt; (life\n&gt;&gt; force - nostril reference) of a person, dives down to Mooladhara\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; destroys the attachment to the mighty sense organs there, the\n&gt; Mother is\n&gt;&gt; freed and can move up to Merge with the Lord (i.e. self-\n&gt; consciousness\n&gt;&gt; ascending to merge with Brahman). Basically Varaha avatara\n&gt; represents the\n&gt;&gt; sattwa guna in a person that tries to give detachment from the\n&gt; perceptions\n&gt;&gt; of the sense organs and then make the calm praana dives down to\n&gt; Mooladhara\n&gt;&gt; to give balance to Kundalini to move up.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; -I am getting married in Oct this year, can u please tell me how\n&gt; is it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; going to affect my spiritual life. My fiancee&#39;s Birth Details-\n&gt; 02 Oct\n&gt;&gt; &gt; 1980, 13:20, New Delhi, India.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Good luck with your marital life!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Another thing is you mentioned about drigdasa Pisces from March\n&gt; 2008\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to March 2017 but when I checked in Parashar it shows me it is\n&gt; from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; March 2007 to March 2016. I am just a novice in astrology so if\n&gt; you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; can explain me which one is correct.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Drigdasa was taught incorrectly by some teachers earlier, based on\n&gt; wrongly\n&gt;&gt; remembered teachings of tradition. Most softwares (including my\n&gt; own\n&gt;&gt; Jagannatha Hora software) calculate it incorrectly. My personal\n&gt; version of\n&gt;&gt; the software (to be released to the public later) calculates it\n&gt; based on\n&gt;&gt; Parasara&#39;s teachings and I believe it to be correct based on my\n&gt; study of the\n&gt;&gt; charts of several spiritualists. I taught it in the recent two\n&gt; issues of\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Jyotish Digest&quot; magazine.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Next thing is about meditation, can you please advise me any good\n&gt;&gt; &gt; meditation postures or any book where I can learn some.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Don&#39;t worry about technicalities too much. The most fundamental\n&gt; thing is\n&gt;&gt; that your back and neck should be erect, straight and not tense at\n&gt; the same\n&gt;&gt; time. You may sit on floor cross-legged preferably or even sit in\n&gt; a chair if\n&gt;&gt; you have weak knees. The most important thing is the back and neck\n&gt; being\n&gt;&gt; erect. Secondly, close the eyes, otherwise a lot of fire is wasted\n&gt; in the\n&gt;&gt; act of seeing. That agni is better used for other things! Then\n&gt; repeat the\n&gt;&gt; mantra. If your focus is wandering elsewhere, don&#39;t panic and\n&gt; worry too\n&gt;&gt; much. Just bring back your mind to the mantra. Try your best to\n&gt; focus on the\n&gt;&gt; mantra. With time, you will succeed.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Finally remember - no effort is wasted. Even an effort that seems\n&gt; to be not\n&gt;&gt; yielding results is actually working towards a final result. If a\n&gt; straw of\n&gt;&gt; the grass makes the scales tilt, it does not mean all the objects\n&gt; placed on\n&gt;&gt; the scale previously were unneeded! Just have faith and keep doing\n&gt; sadhana.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;Sanjeev Narula&quot; &lt;san_narula@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Sunday, February 17, 2008 4:22 AM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Need more help\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Hari OM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; First of all I would like to thank you for the illustrative and\n&gt; quick\n&gt;&gt; &gt; reply.

This\n&gt; shows\n&gt;&gt; &gt; devotion\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; to Krishna. In navamsa, the 12th from atma karaka is empty and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mercury owns\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; it. Mercury is in Scorpio with Rahu. This suggests that worship\n&gt; of Lord\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Varaha (Vishnu&#39;s boar incarnation) can give you fast spiritual\n&gt; progress.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Please contact suresh.battar@ (http://ashramaustralia.net) and\n&gt; ask\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; him where you can get a homa kundam in Australia. Swami Suresh\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Battar is a\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Hindu priest in Canberra. In case homa kundas are available\n&gt; there,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; he may be\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; able to direct you. In the worst case, any square or circle\n&gt; shaped\n&gt;&gt; &gt; vessel\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; with some depth (made of copper or bronze but not iron) can be\n&gt; used.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Good\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; luck for your homam.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Regarding books, there are too many. But direct experience\n&gt; through\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; meditation is a far better teacher than books. Just surrender\n&gt; to the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Lord,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; accept wholeheartedly that all the diverse objects our senses\n&gt;&gt; &gt; perceive in\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; this universe are all different manifestations of the Lord and\n&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; we are\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; perceiving them differently because of our own impurity. If we\n&gt; keep\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; reminding ourselves of this whenever our mind is overly\n&gt; attracted to or\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; repelled by something, that itself is a very useful sadhana. In\n&gt;&gt; &gt; addition, if\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; you spend a considerable time everyday in meditation, that too\n&gt; helps.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; For you, I strongly recommend &quot;Jnaneshwari&quot;, a commentary on\n&gt;&gt; &gt; BhagavadGita by\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj. This is a unique commentary by a unique\n&gt; saint,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; who is\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the re-incarnation of a rishi and had a direct dwaitic and\n&gt; adwaitic\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; experience. There is a difference between writings coming from\n&gt;&gt; &gt; knowledge\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; acquired by reading books or hearing from others and writings\n&gt; coming\n&gt;&gt; &gt; from\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; the knowledge acquired in a direct experience. More than 700\n&gt; years ago,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Jnaneshwar Maharaj entered a cave in Alandi in his physical\n&gt; body at\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the age\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; of 21 years and still meditating there. I have NOT read a more\n&gt;&gt; &gt; competent or\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; sublime commentary on Krishna&#39;s teaching. It is quite an\n&gt; inspired\n&gt;&gt; &gt; work. A\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; good English translation of this work is available at\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.amazon.com/Jnaneshwars-Gita-Jnaneshwari-Swami-\n&gt; Kripananda/dp/0911307648\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; is the highest work on Hindu philosophy in my\n&gt;&gt; &gt; opinion.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; When Maharshi Viswamitra wanted Lord Ramachandra to come with\n&gt; him to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; forest,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Rama was in confusion and a little pensive. In the presence of\n&gt; Maharshi\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Viswamitra, King Dasaratha and many other learned people,\n&gt; Maharshi\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Vasishtha\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; imparted the essence of all Upanishats to Rama. His teachings\n&gt; were\n&gt;&gt; &gt; captured\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; by Valmiki and the work is known as &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;. There\n&gt; is an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; inspired\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; English translation available at\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.amazon.com/Vasisthas-Yoga-\n&gt; Venkatesananda/dp/0791413640/ref=sr_1_1?\n&gt; ie=UTF8&s=books&qid=1201988303&sr=1-1\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Various Puranas and Upanishats make a very useful reading too.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; --\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; --\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;Sanjeev Narula&quot; &lt;san_narula@&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Saturday, February 02, 2008 12:46 AM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Need more help\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha Ji and all other aspirants.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Although this is my first writing in this group but i have\n&gt; been\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; reading the threads for almost one year now. And you people\n&gt; have\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; helped me a lot to find out the right path at many times but\n&gt; now i\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; feel a bit lost again.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As it can be seen from my chart details what brought me here(\n&gt; and to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; spiritual path) like many others. I still remember the thread\n&gt; where\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha Ji said that there is no need to fear of Sani and\n&gt; now i have\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; realised what he meant.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; I have learned a little bit of astrology from this thread and\n&gt; from\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; other  sources but with that i can not really make any\n&gt; decisions of\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the path i need to follow. As i have seen that there are many\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; enlightened and intelligent aspirants in this group so if\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; someone(especially Narasimha Ji)can look at my chart and\n&gt; guide me i\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; will be very thankful. My birth details are given below:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Date- 17/03/1979\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Time- 12:45 PM\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Birth Place- Ferozepur(Punjab), India\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Another thing is that till now i have been reading some\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Scriptures/Spiritual writings from here and there and doing\n&gt; some\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meditation and chanting of Mahamantra. I have really seen and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; experienced the effect of all this but all this was random and\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; unplanned. Now i have come to a stage where i feel that my\n&gt; spiritual\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; progress has stopped. So first of all i am thinking of\n&gt; reading more to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; get some knowledge but i have no idea what to read and from\n&gt; where to\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; get the books.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Second thing is i am planning to do Mahaganapathi Homam on a\n&gt; regular\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; basis so i have bought all the Materials Needed except the\n&gt; homa kundam\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; which i could not find as i live in Australia so can anyone\n&gt; tell me\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what else can i use as i can not even dig a pit in the ground.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Although there are so many other things i want to ask but if\n&gt; someone\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; can help me with only these i would be very thankful to him\n&gt; and i will\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; pray to Lord for him.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks in advance\n&gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Sanjeev\n\n\n"}}
