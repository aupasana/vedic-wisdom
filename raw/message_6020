A de=\r\nvotee in Tamil Nadu used  to\nrecite Namah Chivaya (instead of  Namah Sivaya=\r\n) with such faith that  he\nwas able to walk on water while reciting  Nama C=\r\nhivaya. One day a \ngrammarian taught the devotee to pronounce the mantra  c=\r\norrectly as \nNamah Sivaya. But with the correct pronunciation, the devotee =\r\n could no \nlonger walk on water. He fell into the water because he was  \nco=\r\nncentrating on the pronunciation of the mantra and had lost faith in\nhis Gu=\r\nru who gave the mantra.\n\n\nThere was a sweeper woman who approached her empl=\r\noyer,  a proud\nNamboodiri Brahmin of Kerala, for a mantra  she could recite=\r\n. He was\nangry that she should ask for a mantra, as she  was of  a low cast=\r\ne. But\nshe persisted. The Namboodiri yelled at her  contemptuously  &quot;Go and=\r\n\nrecite Tapala Curry&quot;, meaning frog curry. The  woman took it in \ngood fait=\r\nh and went on repeating the phrase with such  devotion that she\nbecame  enl=\r\nightened. People asked her who her Guru  was, and when she\ntold them they  =\r\nwent and praised his disciple&#39;s  saintliness and how\ngood a Guru he must be=\r\n. But  the Namboodiri had  forgotten all about the\nlow caste woman. Now he =\r\nremembered  the incident  and felt sorry for\nhimself; for he was still in s=\r\namsara while she had become enlightened \nwith the &#39;frog curry&#39; mantra! All =\r\n these parables emphasise the\nimportance of the attitude or bhava in mantra=\r\n japa.
