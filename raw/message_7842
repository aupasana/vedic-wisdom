A lot of \npeople are starving without food to eat. As those who can afford food \nwaste the limited food that is available, that jacks up food prices and \nmakes it even more inaccessible to starving people. This is already a \nserious problem according to scientists and I am afraid will get much \nworse in coming decades.\n\nGiven this, wasting food is a really really really terrible sin in \ntoday&#39;s times. Please don&#39;t waste food. This includes:\n\n(1) Cooking more food than you need and throwing it away,\n(2) Serving more food than you can eat in your plate and throwing it \naway\n(3) Buying more vegetables/fruits than you need and letting them get \nspoiled\n\nPlease treat Mother Annapurna (personification of food that sustains us) \nwith respect, love and humility (rather than arrogance, contempt and \npride). World (and we) needs her blessings and kindness.\n\n*        *        *\n\nOn a similar note, some ladies do rituals where chick peas soaked in \nwater, fruits etc, sweets etc are distributed to other ladies. I have \nseen so many ladies casually get these food items, let them rot and then \nthrow them away. The notion that giving food to people is good karma is \nbased on the assumption that they actually eat it or use otherwise. If \nthey waste it, it is bad karma for both parties.\n\nPlease do not accept any food that you cannot use. Also, don&#39;t \ndistribute food to people who do not need it. Instead, feed homeless, \nneedy people. Doing rituals with no common sense and just for the heck \nof it, is not good. Such rituals produce no results whatsoever. Blindly \nadhering to traditions that are doing no good really, is like dressing a \ncorpse in beautiful clothes and jewellery. Use common sense and do \n*real* good to others and the world, than engaging in fake *symbols* \nthat in reality harm the world.\n\nSorry for the strong language, but I do see many people abusing Mother \nAnnapoorna and I think this is terrible for the world. This needs to \nchange.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
