The su=\r\nbject matter is the part of that book.\n\nHonestly, though i adore vivekanand=\r\na so much, found it very hard to understand the statements. there are few o=\r\nther quotes in the same book which i could not reconcile with.\n\nOnly possib=\r\nle answer to such thing is - &quot;Take everything with pinch of salt&quot;. As Naras=\r\nimha Says - Everybody (Even Ramakrishna himself) can be deluded by Mahaamaa=\r\nya!!! she is the ultimate authority in the realm of Dualistic world and cap=\r\nable of deluding everybody.\n\nso as Rajarshi has said, Think for your self. =\r\nif something is not digestable, don&#39;t be sycophant to accept it - don&#39;t for=\r\nce you mind to accept it just because they are the words from the mouth of =\r\nsaintly authority.\n\nbest reagards,\n\nUtpal \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, Samir Shah &lt;solaris.smoke@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I t=\r\nhink you make a very good point. You&#39;ve raised something that has\n&gt; made me=\r\n stop to think many times. It seems to me that Swami Vivekananda\n&gt; made man=\r\ny statements - especially about Hinduism and India - that could\n&gt; be constr=\r\nued to be disparaging of other religions and cultures, and that\n&gt; to me at =\r\nleast seemed a little unwarranted.\n&gt; \n&gt; Whether this can be put down simply=\r\n to naivete, or whether it served\n&gt; some purpose which we do not see, and i=\r\ns now taken out of context, I\n&gt; don&#39;t know. In either case I have yet to re=\r\nconcile those statements with\n&gt; the rest of his teachings.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kind regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; \n&gt; Samir\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 25/08/2009 11:46, rajarshi nandy wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; /To any man who knows anything about Indian histor=\r\ny, that very statement\n&gt; &gt; proves that the whole thing was a fraud, because=\r\n the temple of Jagannath\n&gt; &gt; is an old Buddhistic temple. We took this and =\r\nothers over and\n&gt; &gt; re-Hinduised them. /\n&gt; &gt; // \n&gt; &gt; With all due respect t=\r\no the great man that Swamiji was, he was possibly\n&gt; &gt; not aware what kind o=\r\nf effects an ill-researched statement may have in\n&gt; &gt; future.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Tha=\r\nt statement above is very controvertial and possibly incorrect. But\n&gt; &gt; the=\r\n fact that it comes from Vivekananda, often people may consider it to\n&gt; &gt; b=\r\ne sacroscant and land up with wrong conclusions. Without a doubt,\n&gt; &gt; Swami=\r\nji was a spiritual Giant, but he was not a historian. He naively\n&gt; &gt; accept=\r\ned most of the ideas about Indian history as propagated by western\n&gt; &gt; scho=\r\nlars.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Therefore, my advise, read lots and form your /own /opinion=\r\ns. When it\n&gt; &gt; comes to aspects of /materialistic/ knowledge, NOTHING and N=\r\nO ONE is\n&gt; &gt; beyond questioning.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
