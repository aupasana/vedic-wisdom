But I have often feel that they are themsel=\r\nves are not convinced when they argue. they are &#39;hollow&#39; arguments. However=\r\n , I&#39;ll honestly say that i have no answers for &#39;life in a Plant&#39;.\n\nThe peo=\r\nple who argue such as&#39;: Most eat meat in the world, Egg is vegetarian, Plan=\r\nt also has life, One will not get required nourishments only with vegetaria=\r\nn food, If we don&#39;t eat fish then sea will be full of fishes:), Earth will =\r\nbe full of chickens:0, Veg food will become unaffordable if everybody will =\r\nbecome vegetarian :Etc...are more often than not, put up such arguments to =\r\ndefend however as i said earlier they are themselves not convinced.\n\nVegete=\r\nrian people have their own arguments but all these are mere arguments. I pe=\r\nrsonally can not look at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its =\r\npathetic site. People in their excitements stand in queue to see the cuttin=\r\ng of throat of a chicken and then take away that as parcel. The flash of so=\r\n cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the h=\r\numans that they just overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which c=\r\nomes out of water is such a disturbing site. Panting for water (i don&#39;t hav=\r\ne proper English word to describe the condition of a fish out of water). an=\r\nd then the dead fish thus is so tasty.\n\nThe bottom line is that &quot;They canno=\r\nt overcome&quot; the cravings for the meat, fish and eggs. This is a naked reali=\r\nty.\n\nDear Rajarshi, However i try, i am not convinced with arguments in fav=\r\nour of Nonveg food. Only at the cold places and deserts where survival was =\r\nthe main consideration, i can slightly agree but that too during ancient da=\r\nys. not now...Now everywhere Veg food is easily available.\n\n***\nFew months =\r\nback, a young girl from Germany came to work in my office for 6 months. onc=\r\ne i casually asked her as to what she eats during lunch. what she said was =\r\nnot at all expected. she said that she is pure vegetarian and eats only Veg=\r\n food since 3 years now and wants to continue that way whole life. As expec=\r\nted, i was very happy and i further asked the reason. The answer she gave s=\r\no much happiness. She said that She does not want to kill to eat. Vow! I sa=\r\nlute her from my heart.\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n  \n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; I slightly disagree with your below mail.
