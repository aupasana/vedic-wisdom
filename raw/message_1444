Are you really this body?\n\n          One norma=\r\nlly identifies with a body, a name and a limited identity that goes \n      =\r\n    with that body. This identification is very very strong..\n\n          Yo=\r\nu are actually Brahman, the all-pervading, all-knowing and all-being \n     =\r\n     essence of the universe. The same essence manifests as various beings,=\r\n \n          including various deities and various people, including your ow=\r\nn body. And \n          *you* really are that essence and not the body. Stil=\r\nl you identify only with \n          the body.\n\n          It is possible to =\r\ndestroy this self identification with the body and \n          identify with=\r\n another object such as a deity. When you identify with a \n          deity,=\r\n your consciousness is in communion with that of the deity. Your will, \n   =\r\n       thoughts and actions are those of the deity.\n\n          * * *\n\n     =\r\n     &gt; When somebody says me to self identify with Shiva what exactly I hav=\r\ne to \n          &gt; do ?\n\n          First I can tell you what exactly you hav=\r\ne to avoid: Do NOT tell yourself \n          that you will now identify with=\r\n Shiva, because Shiva is great and you want \n          to be great. In othe=\r\nr words, this is not for ego satisfaction. In fact, \n          until ego co=\r\nmpletely goes, it is not even possible.\n\n          Before you can self-iden=\r\ntify with any deity, first your false \n          self-identification with b=\r\nody has to cease. You should absolutely not think \n          of your body a=\r\ns &quot;I&quot;..\n\n          Your will, thoughts and actions should be those of Shiva=\r\n.\n\n          Will Shiva think of a specific physical body as &quot;I&quot;? No. If a =\r\nspecific \n          physical body has good or bad things happening to it, w=\r\nill Shiva feel \n          pleasure or pain? No. If people are praising a sp=\r\necific person, will Shiva \n          feel proud? No. If people are attackin=\r\ng and criticizing a specific person, \n          will Shiva feel angry? No.\n=\r\n\n          The first step is to overcome attachment to the body, name etc. =\r\nReach a \n          state where you are not very sensitive to pleasure and p=\r\nain to the body and \n          praise and criticism of your thoughts and ac=\r\ntions by other people. Reach a \n          state where equanimity of mind ca=\r\nn be maintained in all circumstances.\n\n          WHEN you reach that state,=\r\n meditate with a mantra of Shiva while thinking of \n          Shiva.\n\n     =\r\n     * * *\n\n          Ramakrishna Paramahamsa could self-identify with not =\r\nonly deities, but \n          pretty much any object of the universe. Once h=\r\ne went into deep meditation \n          while admiring the beauty of grass i=\r\nn the lawn with dew on it. As he was \n          absorbed in deep meditation=\r\n, a bird came and walked on the grass.

I can althoug=\r\nh feel some of the symptoms that you \n        have mentioned. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;And a=\r\ns per your writings I understand that this \n        has to be permanent sta=\r\nte.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Can we have self identification with a \n        deity for some t=\r\nime say some minutes or fraction of seconds since \n        Vimalananda in h=\r\nis book Aghora mentions that when you do this(some \n        action)&nbsp; t=\r\nhen self identify with Shiva.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Also I can \n        understand that ev=\r\nerything is Brahman but still &quot;I&quot; like to think of \n        various deities=\r\n like Shiva, Ganesha , Devi ma , Vishu ji etc while \n        eating or befo=\r\nre sleeping. Is this ok ? If not Ok then how can I get rid \n        of such=\r\n thinking ? &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thank you,&lt;BR&gt;Manish&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On \n        &lt;B&gt;Fri,=\r\n 6/3/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

Are you really this body?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One \n          normall=\r\ny identifies with a body, a name and a limited identity that \n          goe=\r\ns &lt;BR&gt;with that body. This identification is very very \n          strong..&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You are actually Brahman, the all-pervading, \n          all-knowing =\r\nand all-being &lt;BR&gt;essence of the universe. The same \n          essence mani=\r\nfests as various beings, &lt;BR&gt;including various deities and \n          vario=\r\nus people, including your own body. And &lt;BR&gt;*you* really are that \n        =\r\n  essence and not the body. Still you identify only with &lt;BR&gt;the \n         =\r\n body.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It is possible to destroy this self identification with \n    =\r\n      the body and &lt;BR&gt;identify with another object such as a deity. When \n=\r\n          you identify with a &lt;BR&gt;deity, your consciousness is in communion=\r\n with \n          that of the deity. Your will, &lt;BR&gt;thoughts and actions are=\r\n those of \n          the deity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When somebody says=\r\n me to self \n          identify with Shiva what exactly I have to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\ndo ?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;First \n          I can tell you what exactly you have to avoid:=\r\n Do NOT tell yourself \n          &lt;BR&gt;that you will now identify with Shiva,=\r\n because Shiva is great and \n          you want &lt;BR&gt;to be great. In other w=\r\nords, this is not for ego \n          satisfaction. In fact, &lt;BR&gt;until ego c=\r\nompletely goes, it is not even \n          possible.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Before you can s=\r\nelf-identify with any deity, first \n          your false &lt;BR&gt;self-identific=\r\nation with body has to cease. You should \n          absolutely not think &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;of your body as &quot;I&quot;..&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your will, \n          thoughts and actions s=\r\nhould be those of Shiva.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Will Shiva think \n          of a specific p=\r\nhysical body as &quot;I&quot;? No. If a specific &lt;BR&gt;physical \n          body has goo=\r\nd or bad things happening to it, will Shiva feel \n          &lt;BR&gt;pleasure or=\r\n pain? No. If people are praising a specific person, \n          will Shiva =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;feel proud? No. If people are attacking and criticizing \n          a sp=\r\necific person, &lt;BR&gt;will Shiva feel angry? No.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The first \n          s=\r\ntep is to overcome attachment to the body, name etc. Reach a \n          &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;state where you are not very sensitive to pleasure and pain to the \n      =\r\n    body and &lt;BR&gt;praise and criticism of your thoughts and actions by \n    =\r\n      other people. Reach a &lt;BR&gt;state where equanimity of mind can be \n    =\r\n      maintained in all circumstances.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;WHEN you reach that state, \n =\r\n         meditate with a mantra of Shiva while thinking of &lt;BR&gt;Shiva.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;* \n          * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ramakrishna Paramahamsa could self-identify with =\r\nnot only \n          deities, but &lt;BR&gt;pretty much any object of the universe=\r\n. Once he went \n          into deep meditation &lt;BR&gt;while admiring the beaut=\r\ny of grass in the \n          lawn with dew on it. As he was &lt;BR&gt;absorbed in=\r\n deep meditation, a bird \n          came and walked on the grass.
