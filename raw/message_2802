The 3 steps taken by Sri Vishnu after Bali=\r\n allowed for them also\nsignify how the lord will dissolve the maya and take=\r\ns control of our\nbodies and life.  With the first step the lord took contro=\r\nl over the\nBhuva Loka (association with body and material aspects) and with=\r\n the\nsecond step he took control over the higher lokas (indriyas) and final=\r\nly\nthe last step was left and only place left was Balis head (ahamkara)\nwhi=\r\nch was dissolved as well.\n\nIf you allow God to be part of your life then he=\r\n will work in mystical\nways and take care of the illusion of your body, sen=\r\nses, and finally\nyour ego\n\n2.  The story cannot be complete without the rol=\r\ne played by Shukracharya\nor the guru of the Asuras.  He knew that Sri Vaman=\r\na was no other than\nSri Vishnu and warned Bali but the latter out of pride =\r\nand duty still\ngave his word (there was still some goodness in Bali, maybe =\r\na small\npiece).  To seal the deal water was to be put out of the kamandalu =\r\nof\nSri Vamana onto the hands of Bali.  Shukracharya shrinks to a small size=\r\n\nand tries to block the flow of water from the Kamandalu and Sri Vamana\ntak=\r\nes a straw and clears the way and Shukracharya loses an eye.  The\nguru of t=\r\nhe Asuras becomes half blind (opposed to Brihaspati).\n\nAs the devata tries =\r\nto enter the body of a devotee, the Rajas element\nwill play all kinds of tr=\r\nicks and block the path.   A straw\n(representing qualities of Surya or the =\r\nscriptures) accompanied by an\nable Guru (Sri Vamana) can clear the path.\n\nR=\r\negards\n\nVeenu\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Prasanth Jalasutram\n&lt;j=\r\nvrsprasanth@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; [image: [vishnu_avatar_QJ96_l.jpg]]\n&gt;\n&lt;http://2=\r\n.bp.blogspot.com/_S49ZRy14b1M/Ssv69e578aI/AAAAAAAAAXA/pwpQ5i4KI&#92;\n50/s1600-h=\r\n/vishnu_avatar_QJ96_l.jpg&gt;\n&gt; *SRI VAMANA AVATHARA*\n&gt; **\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt; *Significa=\r\nnce\n&gt; *\n&gt;\n&gt; *Sri Vamana Avathara was fifth in the line of Dasavatharas of L=\r\nord Sri\nMaha\n&gt; Vishnu. This avathara took place during Treta Yuga before Sr=\r\ni\nParashurama\n&gt; Avathara. Lord Maha Vishnu took this avathara in order to s=\r\nuppress the\n&gt; arrogance, vanity and pride of Emperor Bali (Bali Chakravarth=\r\ni) and to\n&gt; restore the glory, power and authority of Lord Indra over the H=\r\neaven\nwho had\n&gt; lost his power and kingdom (Swarga) to King Bali. Sri Vishn=\r\nu Sahasra\nNama\n&gt; Sthothra describes in sloka # 17 and 56, the Lord asUpendr=\r\no Vaamanah\nand\n&gt; Trivikramah.*\n&gt; *Lord in this avathara was known as Vamana=\r\n because he was dwarf in\nform at\n&gt; the beginning. He was known as Trivikram=\r\na because he is the one who\nhas\n&gt; conquered the three worlds, Earth, Upper =\r\nworlds and Nether worlds. He\ngrew\n&gt; to a gigantic size while suppressing th=\r\ne King Bali and conquered the\n&gt; Universe with just three paces of his foot.=\r\n He was also referred as\nUpendra\n&gt; as he was known to be the younger brothe=\r\nr of Indra. We find all the\nthree\n&gt; names Trivikrama, Vamana and Upendra wh=\r\nile reciting 24 Kesava Namas.\nAn\n&gt; exclusive Purana named after Lord Vamana=\r\n called Sri Vamana Purana\nscripted\n&gt; by Lord and Sage Veda Vyasa forms part=\r\n of 18 great Puranas called\nAshtadasa\n&gt; Puranas.*\n&gt;\n&gt; *Lord Vamana was born=\r\n as the son of Sage Kashyapa (Kashyapa\nPrajapathi) and\n&gt; his wife Aditi in =\r\naccordance to the penance done by the couple and\nprayers\n&gt; of Indra and oth=\r\ner Deities. He was born on Bhadrapada Sukla Dwadasi\nday\n&gt; under the star co=\r\nnstellation of Sravana Nakshatra. This day every year\nis\n&gt; celebrated as Va=\r\nmana Jayanthi the day on which Lord Sri Vamana was\nborn. As\n&gt; soon as he wa=\r\ns born He took no time in attaining the boyhood becoming\na Vatu\n&gt; (Brahmach=\r\nari). Lord Brahma himself initiated the Gayathri Manthra to\nSri\n&gt; Vamana. H=\r\nis attire was that of a typical Brahmin Brahmachari, wearing\na\n&gt; Koupeena (=\r\nLoin cloth), a sacred thread, holding a Chatthra (Umbrella)\nin one\n&gt; hand a=\r\nnd Dhanda/Kamandalu (stick and water jug) in the other, his\nupper body\n&gt; co=\r\nvered with Deer skin, wearing a ring of Dharbha (Kusa grass) to his\nthird\n&gt;=\r\n finger.*\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt; *Significance of Three Steps*\n&gt; *Lord Vamana went to Kin=\r\ng Maha Bali and asks for three steps of land\n&gt; measured by his foot as char=\r\nity. Initially Bali hesitated to donate\njust\n&gt; three paces of land as it is=\r\n a disgrace to his status and was guilty\nto give\n&gt; such charity. But later =\r\nagreed, upon insisting by Lord Vamana and\npromised\n&gt; to give three paces of=\r\n land as charity measured by Sri Vamana&#39;s\nfoot. When\n&gt; Maha Bali completed =\r\nthe ritual process of donating the land, Lord\nVamana\n&gt; assumed his cosmic f=\r\norm (Trivikrama), measured the entire Earth\nincluding\n&gt; the nether worlds b=\r\ny his first step.*\n&gt; *\n&gt; With his second step He measured the entire upper =\r\nworlds. When his\nfoot\n&gt; reached the zenith it crossed the Sathya Loka where=\r\n Lord Brahma stays.\n&gt; Seeing the foot of Lord Maha Vishnu, Lord Brahma offe=\r\nred abhishekam\nand\n&gt; washed the Lord&#39;s foot and the water that fell from Hi=\r\ns foot\nsanctified the\n&gt; entire Universe. We find in the verses of great com=\r\nposer and Saint Sri\n&gt; Annamacharya referring to the foot washed by Lord Bra=\r\nhma (Brahma\nKadigina\n&gt; Padamu) in one of his verses on Lord Sri Venkateswar=\r\na.*\n&gt; *\n&gt; When the entire Universe was conquered by just two paces of Lord =\r\nSri\nMaha\n&gt; Vishnu (Vamana) there was no space left in the Universe to keep\n=\r\nVamana&#39;s\n&gt; third pace. When Lord Vamana asked Maha Bali the space to keep h=\r\nis\nthird\n&gt; pace, all the pride and vanity of Maha Bali had vanished and he =\r\nhad no\n&gt; hesitation in surrendering before the Supreme Lord. Having realise=\r\nd\nthe\n&gt; Supreme Reality, Bali readily offered his own head to keep the\nLord=\r\n&#39;s third\n&gt; step. Lord Vamana immediately placed his third pace (his foot) o=\r\nn the\nhead\n&gt; of Bali and sent him to the nether worlds. Thus the ahankara (=\r\negoism)\nof\n&gt; Maha Bali was suppressed and Indra was restored with his kingd=\r\nom.*\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt; *Uniqueness*\n&gt;\n&gt; *Sri Vamana Avathara is the first Avathara w=\r\nhere Lord Sri Maha Vishnu\ntook\n&gt; complete human form though dwarf at the be=\r\nginning. The uniqueness of\nthis\n&gt; Avathara is that the Lord did not use any=\r\n weapon. The only weapon he\nused\n&gt; was that of begging in front of King Bal=\r\ni in accordance to the\nBrahmanic\n&gt; (Brahmachari) form he had attained. The =\r\nLord did not kill the King\nBali even\n&gt; though he was an Asura. He conquered=\r\n him in a Vedic way with his\n&gt; intelligence. Unlike other Avatharas, Vamana=\r\n Avathara was a Sattvik\n&gt; Avathara. Lord had to resort to this strategy due=\r\n to the promise he\nhad made\n&gt; to his beloved devotee Prahlada not to kill a=\r\nny of his descendants.\n&gt; Astrologically Jupiter (Guru) is said to be the Pa=\r\nramatma Amsa of\nVamana\n&gt; Avathara.*\n&gt; **\n&gt; *Message from Vamana Avathara\n&gt; =\r\n*\n&gt;\n&gt; *Hidden behind every Avathara of Paramatma there is a message/moral\n&gt;=\r\n conveyed. In this Sri Vamana Avathara the message is total surrender\nto th=\r\ne\n&gt; God however mighty one may be. When once you shed your ego and\nsurrende=\r\nr\n&gt; totally with devotion at the feet of the supreme Lord there is nothing\n=\r\none\n&gt; can worry about and will get total protection. This is what exactly\nh=\r\nas\n&gt; happened in case of Bali who had no other alternative but to surrender=\r\n\nto\n&gt; the Lord Trivikrama who had conquered the three worlds.*\n&gt; *When King=\r\n Bali surrendered in front of Lord Vamana with total\ndevotion, the\n&gt; Lord w=\r\nas very much pleased and gave him boons voluntarily without\nbeing\n&gt; asked b=\r\ny King Bali. He not only made him the ruler of the nether world\n&gt; Suthala b=\r\nut also assured him that He would always protect his kingdom.\nHe\n&gt; also ass=\r\nured Bali that he would become the Indra in the next\nManvanthara. By\n&gt; the =\r\ntouch of Lord&#39;s foot on the head of King Bali all his sins got\ncleaned\n&gt; up=\r\n, he became immortal (Chiranjeevi). This is what one should\nunderstand\n&gt; th=\r\nat we should never ask for alms to the Supreme Lord. If you ask you\nwill\n&gt; =\r\nget only what you had asked. It you don&#39;t ask you will get\neverything that\n=\r\n&gt; you require.*\n&gt; *\n&gt; The story of Bali also bring out the reality that, th=\r\nere is nothing\n&gt; permanent and nothing to be taken for granted in this worl=\r\nd be it\nwealth,\n&gt; beauty, power, status, position or family and nothing bel=\r\nongs to\nanyone.\n&gt; Even the mighty have to fall on one day or the other. We =\r\nhave several\nsuch\n&gt; historical examples that we are also seeing in this mod=\r\nern world.*\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt; *Festivals related to Vamana Avathara:\n&gt; *\n&gt; *The day =\r\non which Lord Vamana was born is celebrated every year on\n&gt; Bhadrapada Sukl=\r\na Dwadasi Day as Vamana Jayanthi.*\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt; *Temples of Vamana Avathara: So=\r\nme of the famous temples of Lord Vamana\nare,\n&gt; *\n&gt; *Ulagalanda Perumal temp=\r\nle: It is a temple of Lord Sri Maha Vishnu in\n&gt; Trivikrama roopa (Vamana Av=\r\nathara).
