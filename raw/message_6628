I used to remember god 24 hors a day. But in 1990 I started =\r\nfearing god and now I hate him so much so that I destroyed my home made tem=\r\nple and his posters. why i did so the reason is as below:\nI am suffering fr=\r\nom ocd (Obsessive compulsive disorder) since 1990. My problem is that whene=\r\nver I am doing some work some part of my mind says that if this work gets d=\r\none I will go to temple but it is not me and I counter this thought by sayi=\r\nng that I will not go to temple. But at the completion of the work I am com=\r\npelled to go to temple. The problem is that I have to go to temple compulsi=\r\nvely and many times again and again. Also the temple which comes to my thou=\r\nghts has to be visited to satisfy my compulsion. Even a simple thought that=\r\n if my son answers the question I will go to temple. I am not even able to =\r\nteach him. I cant cross the road where there is a temple. How can I avoid t=\r\nhat. There are temples all around the world. Please help me out. For past 1=\r\n0 yrs I am taking allopathy medicine. For past 7 months I am taking homeopa=\r\nthy also. But sometimes it goes out of control. Please guide me how can I s=\r\ntop hating GOD. \nRegards\n\nDob :16th april,1975\nPlace:  kangra (Himachal Pra=\r\ndesh)\nTime : 8 pm\n\na\n\n\n\n"}}
