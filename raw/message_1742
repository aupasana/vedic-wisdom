On the contrary, it can even =\r\nincrease pride, which makes it more difficult to experience god.\n \nSwami Vi=\r\nvekananda had one of the sharpest intellects in the world in the last few c=\r\nenturies. The following is a nice quote from him. Just something to ponder.=\r\n.\n \n---------------------------\nFrom http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.info=\r\n/vivekananda/volume_9/conversations_and_interviews.htm (search for &quot;Edith A=\r\nllan&quot;)\n---------------------------\nSWAMI VIVEKANANDA: I am the disciple of =\r\na man who could not write his own name, and I am not worthy to undo his sho=\r\nes. How often have I wished I could take my intellect and throw it into the=\r\n Ganges!\n \nSTUDENT: But, Swami, that is the part of you I like best.\n \nSWAM=\r\nI VIVEKANANDA: That is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=80=94 like I am.\n-=\r\n--------------------------\n \nThe thing with Vivekananda is that he was not =\r\nonly a sharp thinker, but was a fearless and brutally honest speaker.\n \nTho=\r\nugh intelligence can help one understand some scriptural teachings better a=\r\nnd help in the sadhana in the beginning, it is not so useful after a while.=\r\n The qualities of surrender and humility are far more valuable than logic a=\r\nnd analytical thinking.\n \nBTW, I noted that he said in the same series that=\r\n he has to come back once more with his Master Ramakrishna. Of course, Rama=\r\nkrishna also said that he would come back after 100 years along with everyb=\r\nody.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarp=\r\nana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish l=\r\nessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Win=\r\ndows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: h=\r\nttp://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------ \n\n\n"}}
