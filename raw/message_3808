It means that He can still resort to one or all the methods of=\r\n Vasuli. The method(s) may be influenced by his personal nature and prefere=\r\nnces etc... Alternatively, He can just leave it to The Mother to do whateve=\r\nr is needed and what is right. As My Guru said recently to me -&quot;We are talk=\r\ning about the One who manipulates 14 Universes in split second and delude e=\r\nven Maharshis&quot;.\n\nPlease note that the above approach is not a defeatist or =\r\nFatalistic. The Important thing here is the mental approach. How Mr. FL fee=\r\nls in his Mind about the whole episode. The attitude is of the prime import=\r\nance. If He can really think the way mentioned above and engage in &#39;Vasuli&#39;=\r\n or becomes Passive by leaving everything to The Mother, i think he would h=\r\nave followed his *dharma* properly.\n\nBy the way, Aditi bahen - When Krishna=\r\n guides directly, what to talk then? Arjuna did everything as suggested by =\r\nKrishna and Dharma is like Karma, very difficult to understand.\n\n***\nIf I w=\r\nere Mr. Fool, i would follow up for sometime, some more time but would neve=\r\nr engage in the extreme methods of Vasuli or would not allow my friends to =\r\ndo that even if I am hard pressed for money. I would have taken second appr=\r\noach - Leave it to Mother- although I am not a meek by nature and probably =\r\na person with lot of Rajas and Tamas and a staunch follower of Sardar Valla=\r\nbhbhai Patel.\n\nAt the same time, i agree with all the different approaches =\r\ndue to Paatra/Desh/Kaal provided mental approach is of that which is just m=\r\nentioned above. I think then only one can *logically* remain untouched by a=\r\nctions. \n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;d=\r\ninesh_nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal-bhai:\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for your th=\r\noughts.

Now it happened so that Mr. VS could not repay it due to reasons only kno=\r\nwn to him. Mr. VS gives many excuses and many dates but fails and ultimatel=\r\ny does not pay back. Mr. FL is under great pressure due to that.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nMr. FL can have many options to react in the situations:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1] Thinki=\r\nng constantly and repenting for the act He can-\n&gt; &gt;    Curse, Constantly fo=\r\nllow-up, Mount Abuses, Remain under stress, resort to other techniques of &#39;=\r\nVasuli&#39; and resorts to many Internal and external activities concerning tha=\r\nt issue.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In this case, He strongly identifies with the Money, act =\r\nof Giving then expecting it back, Repenting etc...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; OR\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2] =\r\nMr. FL can really grab the golden chance to resort to the implementation of=\r\n knowledge (KIP-Knowledge in Practice) and thinks that it was a Rina which =\r\nneeded to be paid back and practically starts training the mind with that k=\r\nnowledge. He follows up for the money but with the attitude of detachment. =\r\nAlthough he shows to his family and friends that he is extremely concerned =\r\nand it was foolish act etc... But in his mind he thinks that it was a rina =\r\nfrom some past life which was fulfilled. He thinks that they were Money of =\r\nMother and she will take care. If they needed to come back, she will do it =\r\nor if they were to be paid to nullify some past rinas then they will not co=\r\nme back.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With the Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create=\r\n New Rinas and will be able to break free from this particular chain. He ma=\r\ny have successfully PAID BACK his debt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; With the first Approach, M=\r\nr.

As time goes on, the=C2=A0thing in your mind which thinks of sex i=\r\ns incinerated and slowly you find that a naked female(or male as=C2=A0may b=\r\ne the case)=C2=A0body is like a landscape picture just like any other pictu=\r\nre made by Her of nature(like Niagara falls, or Angkor Wat, you need not be=\r\n disturbed by it, you can certainly=C2=A0feel that the picture=C2=A0is very=\r\n beautiful=C2=A0but you need not be aroused by it).

For now I h=\r\nave very mixed feelings on the subject.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps I need to read more=\r\n! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Aghora series books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora i=\r\ns not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the nam=\r\nes of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C2=A0Aghora (aghori) does not see anythi=\r\nng as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestations =\r\nof god and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (go=\r\nd) always, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n When someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while carryi=\r\nng the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama is tr=\r\nue and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself that =\r\nlife and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real. But=\r\n the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth onl=\r\ny when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thing w=\r\ne have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ourselv=\r\nes &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are temporary i=\r\nllusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusi=\r\nons&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want to get it, can=\r\n&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems beautiful=\r\n and other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary illusions. Only =\r\nthe Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  Wh=\r\nen someone attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or angry, can=\r\n&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are temporary illu=\r\nsions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions=\r\n&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; a=\r\nlways. His mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead o=\r\nf *dwelling* on them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad e=\r\ntc and thinking about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries to find and=\r\n focus on what is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety=\r\n we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practically. If feces an=\r\nd fruit are both impermenant illusions and the only permanent reality withi=\r\nn them is the Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he =\r\nmay try a ritual where feces is eaten.=C2=A0But, please remember that eatin=\r\ng feces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed a=\r\nnd not perceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), =\r\nis the main point. For example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose=\r\n, for such a person&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of =\r\nSelf (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, bu=\r\nt the mind will not be dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with =\r\ncertain properties and will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinki=\r\nng that he is Self and he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, a v=\r\nedantin also has the same notions really. He chants vedic verses when eatin=\r\ng food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Neverth=\r\neless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed in on=\r\ne&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant manifestati=\r\nons of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly sal=\r\nty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same=\r\n truth and trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. But =\r\naghora is putting himself in an extreme situation where failure results in =\r\na very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcin=\r\ng one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic vers=\r\ne that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and n=\r\nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while =\r\neating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice)=\r\n taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, i=\r\nf the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it wil=\r\nl be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual =\r\nexperience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by everyone m=\r\nerely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Take anothe=\r\nr simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam and=\r\n homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling o=\r\nn sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is causi=\r\nng guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A regular person wi=\r\nll try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But=\r\n that is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts. After all, such though=\r\nts may still come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years=\r\n, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does not return to=\r\n bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fascination some minds may h=\r\nave for sex?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora will take it to an extreme. He wi=\r\nll try to fix the root cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead =\r\nof keeping sadhana and sex as two different activities (one pure and the ot=\r\nher impure), he may combine them into one without such distinctions of pure=\r\n vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on =\r\nhis lap and then does his japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and r=\r\nesult in sex. He may think that his sadhana is being made impure. But, supp=\r\nose he persists to do japam like that for several months/years. Eventually,=\r\n mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something=\r\n impure. He may no longer feel titillation. The association in his mind bet=\r\nween nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically=\r\n or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of med=\r\nitation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head m=\r\nay not lead to denser and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  denser thoughts relating to sex and distra=\r\nction in sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to meditation. After =\r\nspending so much time in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the att=\r\nraction and thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken do=\r\nwn. Overall, the person&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may be gone larg=\r\nely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior exper=\r\niences and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break =\r\ndown some of these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermi=\r\nne those structures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, is this a fool-proof metho=\r\nd? Not really. It is also possible that the person keeps on engaging in the=\r\n practice merely for sex and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation=\r\n (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if on=\r\ne was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and =\r\nweaknesses head on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a nor=\r\nmal person may push the problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with=\r\n low stakes. Such a risky strategy is not applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0Like Manish said in a mail earlier, =\r\n&quot;what is Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to u=\r\nnderstand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high=\r\n stakes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many ma=\r\ny feel aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it b=\r\nased on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.=\r\n=C2=A0Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* att=\r\nract some people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Ag=\r\nhora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates h=\r\now one absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleas=\r\nant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for va=\r\nrious spiritual paths and explains the basic reality.

His Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis=C2=A0men=\r\ntion=C2=A0great details about all the=C2=A0nine avaranas and different form=\r\ns of the divine mother as one goes through each avarana.=C2=A0In the Dhyana=\r\n Krithi=C2=A0of those, in the very=C2=A0first line he says, &#39;Kamalambike, A=\r\nsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;.=C2=A0That line tells me that=C2=A0even through=\r\n Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; So my question was in that perspective. Anyway, your reply was a great on=\r\ne in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by layers of duality! I=\r\n never thought in those terms. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have started reading D=\r\nurga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it fluently, before I star=\r\nt to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during navaratri of 2010.
