A powerhouse of divine energy, called devata can give\n&gt; =\r\nmillion dollar check to unlimited no of people\n \n&gt; So in this whole exercis=\r\ne priest is a mere mediator or a technician who can\n&gt; interact with both pa=\r\nrties.\n \nIt is valid to say that one gets blessings of a deity through deit=\r\ny&#39;s krupa (kindness and compassion). But then, why do you need a &quot;technicia=\r\nn&quot; and &quot;mediator&quot; to apply for the &quot;kindness and compassion&quot; of Almighty go=\r\nd??? Why cannot one directly interact with the kind and compassionate deity=\r\n, without a &quot;mediator&quot; in between?\n \n*        *        *\n \nRegarding whethe=\r\nr the result is from the priest&#39;s account or deity&#39;s account, both viewpoin=\r\nts are correct in their own way. Let me elaborate.\n \nDeities are present in=\r\n microcosmic form in everyone. When one prays to a deity and contemplates o=\r\nn the deity&#39;s nature and qualities, an interaction occurs between one&#39;s con=\r\nsciousness and the *microcosmic* representation of the deity within one&#39;s c=\r\nonsciousness (which is identical to the [macro]cosmic deity!). A tangible r=\r\nesult - material or spiritual - may occur as a result.\n \nOne can say that i=\r\nt is bestowed by the deity&#39;s krupa. One can also say that a veil in one&#39;s c=\r\nonsciousness has been removed, allowed one to interact with the microcosmic=\r\n representation of the deity and get some shakti (from the deity). Whether =\r\nyou say that one has accumulated shakti now or it is god&#39;s shakti is a matt=\r\ner of terminology. Bottomline is that one could not access that shakti earl=\r\nier (due to dense impurities in one&#39;s consciousness that blocked one&#39;s cons=\r\nciousness from interacting with the microcosmic representation of deity wit=\r\nhin one&#39;s consciousness). With sadhana, those impurities were removed and o=\r\nne could access the shakti. As simple as that. BTW, one may look at the wor=\r\nd &quot;shakti&quot; in an egoistic way, but shakti comes with humility and purity. S=\r\nhakti is almost synonymous to purity.\n \nNow, the same holds for a priest. J=\r\nust because one is born in a specific family, learnt to repeat a few senten=\r\nces and a few actions, one&#39;s consciousness does not automatically have an o=\r\npen access to the microcosmic representation of the deity within it. One is=\r\n born with the same kind of veil and needs to be develop purity to remove i=\r\nt. In the old days, most people from the priestly class were very pure and =\r\nhad a free access to the divinity within them. Unfortunately, though I have=\r\n seen excellent priests, they are a very very small minority today.\n \n*    =\r\n    *        *\n \nOne can disagree with me, but cannot change the facts on t=\r\nhe ground. Remedies done by most people with blind faith in priests do not =\r\nwork. As a result, generation after generation is losing faith in god, in s=\r\nanatana dharma and in remedies. The current sorry state of sanatana dharma =\r\ncannot be improved by sticking to the letter (of orthodoxy) and ignoring th=\r\ne spirit (of shastras).\n \nIf people directly put faith in god (instead of p=\r\nriests), surrender to god and do small amount of sadhana themselves, they w=\r\nill get better results. If more and more people (possibly laymen) do safe a=\r\nnd effective spiritual sadhanas such as homam and start to see the material=\r\n and spiritual benefits, I am confident that eventually faith in god and sa=\r\nnatana dharma will be improved in the coming generations.\n \nThe proof of th=\r\ne pudding is in eating it. If you do a sadhana or remedy, there must be som=\r\ne tangible result. Either you get a desired goal or something related ot yo=\r\nu see a significant transformation in your attitude and thinking, or some s=\r\nuch clear result.\n \nIn their first meeting, do you know what Swami Vivekana=\r\nnda told his foremost disciple Sister Nivedita? He said, &quot;religion is not a=\r\n matter of faith. It is a matter of experience.&quot; \n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt;=\r\n WE, the jIvAs are not beggars but anshA of GOD. ????? ???????\n \nWell, if, =\r\nas you said, results are bestowed essentially due to the kindness and compa=\r\nssion (krupa) of god, what is wrong in becoming a beggar for them? Begging =\r\nstrangers on the street for a dollar and begging god for his &quot;krupa&quot; are no=\r\nt the same and so don&#39;t look at the word beggar with contempt.\n \n*        *=\r\n        *\n \n&gt; It seems Narsimhji is in too much hurry to spread concept of =\r\nhoma in this\n&gt; world. Yes, as this concept is blessed by divine mother homa=\r\n is going to\n&gt; be popular sadhana in coming years. In his anxiety to spread=\r\n this blessing\n \nWell, this body will not last forever. While it lasts, we =\r\nshould do the job assigned to us in this life. If hurry is justified at all=\r\n, it is justified in fulfilling one&#39;s dharma in the universe. Results are n=\r\not in our hands, but actions ARE. There should be NO compromise in performi=\r\nng dharmik actions.\n \nWorld is at a very delicate stage now and the next te=\r\nn years are crucial. Ten innocent and sincere sadhakas doing sadhana today =\r\nis more useful for dharma than thousand such sadhakas doing sadhana fifty y=\r\nears later!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lesson=\r\ns, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pi=\r\ntri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films th=\r\nat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n \n---- Satish Deshpande &lt;satishdesh@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt;=\r\n Date:   \t Thursday, June 24, 2010 3:43 AM\n&gt; From: \tSatish Deshpande &lt;satis=\r\nhdesh@...&gt; Add to Addresses Block Sender\n&gt; To: \tvedic-wisdom@yahoogro=\r\nups.com, vedic-astrology@yahoogroups.com, JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com Add =\r\nto Addresses\n&gt; Subject: \t[vedic-wisdom] Remedies and priests \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Nar=\r\nsimhaji and all respected members          - Namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; Astrologers routi=\r\nnely recommend remedial measures involving mantras and\n&gt; poojas and people =\r\nspend a lot of money on them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Do they work? I will give my 2 cents of =\r\nviews based on my experience and\n&gt; insights. I will be honest, straight-for=\r\nward and blunt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Like\n&gt; me and all others who respect Shri PVR Narsimha=\r\nji as a noble, honest,\n&gt; intelligent, spiritual person and Sanskrit scholar=\r\n must be feeling sad after\n&gt; reading contents in the post heading efficacy =\r\nof astro remedies. It=E2=80=99s really\n&gt; painful to read such thing from a =\r\nperson of his status whom lot of people\n&gt; considered as a good astro-spirit=\r\nual personality. Though I am not having\n&gt; scripture references i=E2=80=99ll=\r\n try to post my humble protest and request to all\n&gt; members to understand a=\r\nnd study shastra deeply for better understanding. \n&gt; \n&gt; Though believers ca=\r\nll priests and get poojas done, in the hope that their\n&gt; problems will be s=\r\nolved, many priests today are incapable of producing any\n&gt; results. As a re=\r\nsult, some believers got accustomed to accepting that a pudding\n&gt; exists ev=\r\nen without eating it and remain hungry throughout life. And some\n&gt; intellig=\r\nent people stopped believing in god and in remedies. Let me first address\n&gt;=\r\n why this has come to be and then talk about what we should do. \n&gt; \n&gt; Resul=\r\nts\n&gt; are produced rather bestowed upon the yajamana by presiding devata or =\r\ndeity and\n&gt; blessings are called ???? [\n&gt; krupA] Here we think results are =\r\nproduced; so let us understand the method. If\n&gt; somebody wants good match f=\r\nor his unmarried daughter and ask some priest to\n&gt; perform remedy and in tu=\r\nrn pay some amount to brahmana or priest. Here the\n&gt; focal point is devata,=\r\n a supreme authority for this ritual; as on yajamana=E2=80=99s\n&gt; behalf pri=\r\nest pray to devata to full feel yajamana=E2=80=99s desire and in return get=\r\n\n&gt; paid. So in this whole exercise priest is a mere mediator or a technicia=\r\nn who\n&gt; can interact with both parties. And interaction means correct ritua=\r\nls with\n&gt; appropriate mantras. So his spiritual or mental strength is not r=\r\nequired but\n&gt; his skill and knowledge is of prime importance. Can we consid=\r\ner a mortal priest\n&gt; to bless a yajamana? And if a priest can bless yajaman=\r\na what is the role of\n&gt; rituals, mantras? The truth is; Blessings are besto=\r\nwed upon the human beings by\n&gt; devatas as only divinity is capable of this.=\r\n And many times fruits are not\n&gt; received due to karmic blockages of yajama=\r\nna. ???????\n&gt; ????????? ???????? [ in kaliyuga four\n&gt; times efforts are nee=\r\nded] and this is due to loss of anushtAna falA for doing\n&gt; bhushudhhI, shar=\r\nIrashudhhI etc. And this is not an easy\n&gt; task on the part of astrologer to=\r\n fix the amount of prArabdha karma of\n&gt; yajamana.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one has one milli=\r\non dollars in one&#39;s bank account, a check given by one\n&gt; for thousand dolla=\r\nrs is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is empty, what good\n&gt; is a thousand=\r\n dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas done\n&gt; and bl=\r\nessings given by a priest without enough spiritual energy cannot bring\n&gt; on=\r\ne any benefits.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yajamana get fruits of the rituals from the inbuilt ba=\r\nnk balance of deities\n&gt; and not of a priest. A powerhouse of divine energy,=\r\n called devata can give\n&gt; million dollar check to unlimited no of people as=\r\n GOD has sanctioned rather\n&gt; appointed them for this work. In Rugveda tradi=\r\ntion in vedic rituals in any\n&gt; pooja with or without homa in the beginning =\r\nthere is one ritual called\n&gt; aAchAryavarana [?????????] means yajamana nomi=\r\nnate a\n&gt; priest for whole ritual to please deity on his behalf and in the e=\r\nnd before\n&gt; visarjana of pooja [?????????] shreyodAn ritual is performed\n&gt; =\r\nin which priest gives all shreyas i.e. punya generated in ritual to yajaman=\r\na.\n&gt; Here we can clearly understand the role of priest and the role of deit=\r\ny. As per\n&gt; karmic law if you bless some body you lose your punya and bless=\r\ned one get that\n&gt; share of punya reducing your strength on all levels. Can =\r\na mortal though highly\n&gt; qualified priest blessed many yajamanas as he inte=\r\nracts with many in his lifetime?\n&gt; This could be possible only for highly e=\r\nvolved soul like saints and yogis as\n&gt; due to great penance they do have su=\r\nch powers. But even for them also some time\n&gt; loss of spiritual energy lead=\r\ns for further penance. We read lot of stories in\n&gt; ancient mythology of sag=\r\nes enticed by apsarAs [superhuman beautiful lady] or if\n&gt; they cursed some =\r\nbody results in renewed penances to regain there status.\n&gt; \n&gt; One important=\r\n note: The power is not in a combination of syllables (mantra)\n&gt; or a seque=\r\nnce of physical actions (ritual). The power is in the MIND that\n&gt; FOCUSES o=\r\nn a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical\n&gt; actions (=\r\nritual). Energy is generated when mind overcomes its tendency to\n&gt; wander a=\r\nnd instead focuses on one thing. Different mantras and rituals as the focus=\r\n\n&gt; points may generate different kinds of energy, but the key is focus. Wit=\r\nhout\n&gt; it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. Focus comes with a lot of=\r\n practice.\n&gt; Most priests are just engaging in casual practice when they go=\r\n and do poojas.\n&gt; In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and brought =\r\nthat energy to the\n&gt; table when they did rituals at the houses of people or=\r\n in temples.\n&gt; \n&gt; ??????????????? [ science of pathway to GOD] and\n&gt; [scien=\r\nce of full feeling desires through devata] i.e. ????????????  are two diffe=\r\nrent things. This science of\n&gt; mantra and devata is not easy to understand.=\r\n Divinity is beyond logic and human\n&gt; mind is not capable to experience it =\r\neasily. As per smruti ?????????? ? ????? is a dictum. We are having four ty=\r\npes of\n&gt; vak [ vani]i.e. vaikharI, madhyamA, pashyantI and parA [?????,\n&gt; ?=\r\n?????, ???????, ???] and last one is the most subtle and\n&gt; imp. We see pict=\r\nure of bramhadeva sitting on a lotus which originates from\n&gt; naval of Vishn=\r\nu indicating creation origin of universe. This is puran based\n&gt; concept of =\r\ncreation and vedic, tantra tradition are having same concept with\n&gt; differe=\r\nnt terminology. The subtle seat of paravak is at naval and creator\n&gt; brahma=\r\n creates this world with the help of saraswati and sarsawati is nothing\n&gt; b=\r\nut 52 syllable; ????????. Saraswati is embodiment of syllables. When two un=\r\nknown person meets first\n&gt; time how they get connected? Through communicati=\r\non and thought is a form of\n&gt; vak, pashyanti. First there is desire to know=\r\n each other and then communication\n&gt; starts. And in communication if some b=\r\nody express negativity communication\n&gt; stops. So for communication soft spe=\r\nech, good words, etc are imp. So how can we\n&gt; assume that mantra or rituals=\r\n are of no importance? These show qualities, tools\n&gt; necessary to get conne=\r\ncted with devatas in right perspective. In scriptures\n&gt; every syllable is a=\r\nssigned colour, form, etc. which denotes the nature of that\n&gt; syllable resu=\r\nlting in typical energy. To be precise power rest with desire and\n&gt; mind is=\r\n a mere tool to channalise that power and strength of desire will decide\n&gt; =\r\ndepth of focused mind. So desire is from yajamana, mind is of priest and\n&gt; =\r\nblessings are from pleased devata. Even in great astro treaty like BPHS, sa=\r\nge\n&gt; parAsharA recommended various rituals of various devatas for removing =\r\nbad\n&gt; effects of bad dashas or bad planetary placements. I wonder if mantra=\r\n and\n&gt; rituals do not count why Narsimhaji is having so many homa manuals. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; To consider spiritual aspect of it, persons like saint or yogis who d=\r\no have\n&gt; dharanA like a solid rock who always rest in Trans or dhyanavashtA=\r\n need not\n&gt; require mantra or tantra, rituals for creating energy. A mere w=\r\nish of them can\n&gt; do work. Normal people like me; require all earlier six s=\r\nteps of ashtAngyOgA of\n&gt; patanjali like yama, niyama, aAsana, praNAyAm, pra=\r\ntyahAr and dharanA. And these\n&gt; all steps are embedded in vedic or tantrik =\r\npooja traditions as mantra, tantra,\n&gt; nyas, etc. So for wish to be get full=\r\n filled by devata many many things count.  \n&gt; \n&gt;  This whole confusion is d=\r\nue to\n&gt; Narsimhaji=E2=80=99s sincere wish to spread spirituality and he is =\r\ndoing this with pure\n&gt; heart. Yes, focus mind is one of the factors in this=\r\n whole exercise. Many have\n&gt; seen shatachandI or mahArudra anushathAna wher=\r\ne many priest at a time read or\n&gt; chant mantras with different level of min=\r\nd focus still yajamana get fruits of\n&gt; it in terms of desires. This is beca=\r\nuse devata is pleased by offerings, japa\n&gt; and hOme which in turn bless the=\r\n yajamana with HIS blessings.  For spirituality focus, pure heart and\n&gt; con=\r\ntinuous efforts are of prime importance but for getting our desires to be\n&gt;=\r\n fulfilled we need correct procedure, appropriate deity and correct mantra.=\r\n\n&gt; Spirituality ??????????????? is a love relationship BTW jiva and parmAtm=\r\nA ????? ?? ????????????; where as ???????????? or mantrashAshtra is a give =\r\nand take relationship ??????\n&gt; ????????. In love\n&gt; karma is not imp but in =\r\ngive and take it is the most imp factor. If someone is\n&gt; named rAm and we c=\r\nall him as ramyA will he be pleased with you? Lord krUshna\n&gt; worshiped for =\r\nbegetting child as santangopAla and same krUshana for bhakti are totally\n&gt; =\r\ndifferent.\n&gt; \n&gt;  It is a hype of old great priests which we\n&gt; constantly he=\r\nar but there were millions of greedy, money minded priest all the\n&gt; time; i=\r\nts human nature. In every satyayuga we have kaliyuga and that is why\n&gt; RAVA=\r\nNA a great dashgranthi brahmana ran away with sitA.  Narsimhaji freely dist=\r\nributing astrology\n&gt; software, lectures, homA manuals is a satyayuga in kal=\r\niyuga. So don=E2=80=99t blame\n&gt; today=E2=80=99s priest; to become perfect i=\r\nn karmakAndA a priest at least give his ten\n&gt; yeas to become perfect in rit=\r\nuals. In old golden days life was simple, there\n&gt; was ???????? and ??????? =\r\nto bramhana. Kings have had sanctioned ??????? [some fertile land] to all p=\r\nriests in old golden\n&gt; days.  And most imp in old golden days\n&gt; also always=\r\n fruits were given by pleased devatas due to offerings, japa,homA\n&gt; etc. an=\r\nd not by personal sadhana of priest. BTW, Sadhana of priest was and is a\n&gt; =\r\npersonal advantage due to punyakarma [past birth=E2=80=99s good deeds] of y=\r\najamana.\n&gt; \n&gt;   We must\n&gt; have gratitude for whole  past\n&gt; generations  for=\r\n maintaining such a divine\n&gt; science in oral tradition for thousands of yea=\r\nrs with such a accuracy[ they\n&gt; know power of syllables, so they maintained=\r\n sanctity of akashrA, ?????- ? ?????? -\n&gt; non-perishable ] due to which we =\r\ncan proclaim ourselves as vedic\n&gt; astrologers, yoga gurus, vedic healers, v=\r\nedic mathematicians etc. Yes, we must\n&gt; mould / change according to [ ???, =\r\n???, ????????? ] surroundings, time and environments but we must not let go=\r\n real ethics,\n&gt; morals, rules of our ancient proved traditions.  \n&gt; \n&gt; Many=\r\n people think that poojas to gods are a serious matter and only a\n&gt; trained=\r\n priest should do them. The procedures have evolved to become quite\n&gt; compl=\r\nicated over the time too! However, complexity of rituals should never be a\n=\r\n&gt; deterrent. Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories everyday=\r\n, 40 grams\n&gt; of protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have n=\r\no access to such\n&gt; balanced food. Will you starve yourself until you find a=\r\n balanced meal or will\n&gt; you manage with whatever you have? If you just hav=\r\ne a bowl of dal (lentil soup)\n&gt; and rice,\n&gt; \n&gt; you will simply eat it. You =\r\natleast get some energy. Similarly, if you do\n&gt; not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; =\r\nto do a mantra/ritual, you need not wait\n&gt; till you know the perfect way. Y=\r\nou can start with what you know. It will only\n&gt; give you energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; The f=\r\near to do rituals without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems from the\n&gt; notion that =\r\nsome mantras/rituals can be dangerous. That notion is not totally\n&gt; baseles=\r\ns, but it is irrelevant today. It is possible to focus the mind on some\n&gt; m=\r\nantras and rituals and get specific results. When used by someone with a hi=\r\ngh\n&gt; level of spiritual energy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast=\r\n and give\n&gt; specific powerful results. However, Nature has purposely hidden=\r\n (almost) such\n&gt; things in this age.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes vedic, tantrik rituals are co=\r\nmplex and should be done by experts only\n&gt; as these are for special purpose=\r\ns and should be done by trained people. There\n&gt; are hundreds of ways for GO=\r\nD realization and a single way to fulfill our\n&gt; desires. If you don=E2=80=\r\n=99t know how to drive a car why opt for a fighter plane?   Only if you eld=\r\ners, gurus have sanctioned it\n&gt; then its ok. Nature has not purposely hidde=\r\nn anything but due to loss of energy\n&gt; in doing bhushudhi, sharirashudhhi e=\r\ntc. for removing karmic blocks we feel we\n&gt; need more energy and we are not=\r\n getting it. Yes, we should not wait for perfect\n&gt; thing as perfection is s=\r\nubjective matter but we must read study, think, analyze\n&gt; before accepting =\r\nany concept. I do fully agree with homA sadhana concept as\n&gt; this is one of=\r\n the best ways for acceleration according to my experiences in my\n&gt; twentie=\r\ns but it is for spirituality and for desires to get full filled through\n&gt; d=\r\neities every thing counts.\n&gt; \n&gt; Different mantras and rituals are like begg=\r\ning bowls of different shapes.\n&gt; They matter only so much. Depending on wha=\r\nt kind of a begging bowl you use, you\n&gt; may be given different kind of alms=\r\n. But it is important to start begging with\n&gt; some begging bowl or the othe=\r\nr, instead of spending years looking for the\n&gt; perfect begging bowl. Instea=\r\nd of waiting for astrologers with half-baked or\n&gt; ill-conceived knowledge t=\r\no tell you the perfect mantra or ritual, do what your\n&gt; heart tells you or =\r\nwhat your guru (or an elder you respect) tells you.\n&gt; \n&gt; WE, the jIvAs are =\r\nnot beggars but anshA of GOD. ????? ??????? . Human being is the best creat=\r\nivity\n&gt; of HIM, the divine. The sole aim of manushyayOnI is to realize HIM.=\r\n In this\n&gt; journey we may face many types of different obstacles due to our=\r\n karma and to\n&gt; surpass them HE has given us power and rights to use our in=\r\ntellect, mind for\n&gt; healthy, wealthy and peaceful life. And whole karma don=\r\ne for this in a pious\n&gt; manner is a sattvic karma. Even for getting fulfill=\r\ned our desires we do have a\n&gt; relationship of respect, love, gratitude with=\r\n devatas. Beggars don=E2=80=99t have any\n&gt; feelings for donors instead they=\r\n even don=E2=80=99t remember them. We are ??????? ??????; children of\n&gt; div=\r\ninity. \n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, unfortunately there are lot of fake astrologers, gurus et=\r\nc. who are\n&gt; misguiding people;but again there is satyuga in kaliyuga. And =\r\nfor everybody,\n&gt; karma counts resulting in happenings of life.\n&gt; \n&gt;  Mantra=\r\ns like Gayatri mantra, Shiva\n&gt; panchakshari mantra, Vishnu sahasranaama sto=\r\ntra, Ganapathi atharva seersha,\n&gt; Hanuman chalisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotr=\r\na, Vishnu&#39;s shadakshari/ashtakshari/dwadasakshari\n&gt; mantra, Venkateswara&#39;s =\r\nashtakshari/dwadasakshari mantra, hare krishna mantra,\n&gt; \n&gt; Chandipath (Dur=\r\nga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama\n&gt; stotra, Vyasa&#39;s na=\r\nvagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam,\n&gt; \n&gt; Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaama stotra e=\r\ntc are *generic* and can work for\n&gt; anyone for any purpose.\n&gt; \n&gt; There\n&gt; ar=\r\ne many generic mantras (see my original mail at the bottom for a sample lis=\r\nt)\n&gt; that are appliable to everybody and can\n&gt; \n&gt; solve\n&gt; ALL problems. For=\r\n example, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra explicitly says it can\n&gt; solve ANY pro=\r\nblem. Instead of looking for a\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;perfect\n&gt; mantra recommendation&quot;, you =\r\ncan pick a generic mantra like that and start\n&gt; sadhana. The key is faith a=\r\nnd persistence.\n&gt; \n&gt; If\n&gt; your kaarmik blockage is the size of a rock, smal=\r\nl amount energy may be enough\n&gt; to move it away. If it is the size of a big=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; boulder\n&gt; on the other hand, much more energy may be needed.\n&gt; \n&gt; It\n=\r\n&gt; seems Narsimhji is in too much hurry to spread concept of homa in this wo=\r\nrld.\n&gt; Yes, as this concept is blessed by divine mother homa is going to be=\r\n popular\n&gt; sadhana in coming years. In his anxiety to spread this blessing =\r\nhe is\n&gt; contradicting his own words. Mantras do have vargabheda and can be =\r\nbroadly\n&gt; categorized as  shrutimantra,\n&gt; smritimantra, puranmantrra and va=\r\nradamantra. For ex. We can broadly classify savitur\n&gt; gayatri as shrutimant=\r\nra; chandipatha as smrutinmantra; vishnusahastranam as\n&gt; puranmantra and sh=\r\nabarimantra[created by great navanath yogis] as varadamantra.\n&gt; The term ge=\r\nneric is itself illusive. Every devata, every mantra is assigned\n&gt; differen=\r\nt power, different work by cosmic mother. It is HER wish for this\n&gt; classif=\r\nication. ????????? ??????????( ?????????? ) ??????\n&gt; ????????? [ For\n&gt; fulf=\r\nilling jiva=E2=80=99s desires and subsequent karma GOD manifest in differen=\r\nt form ]\n&gt; is the nucleus of all devatabheda and related different forms, m=\r\nantra, rituals\n&gt; etc.  Why remedies are needed, how they\n&gt; can give desirab=\r\nle fruits, how can we achieve this and last but imp how this\n&gt; happen shoul=\r\nd be focal point here. Remedies are needed to full fill desires, by\n&gt; remov=\r\ning karmic blocks we can get this, by doing various correct procedures we\n&gt;=\r\n can achieve this and this happens due to generated punya in this whole\n&gt; e=\r\nxercise. For full filling desires we should know the depth of karma, to rem=\r\nove\n&gt; karmic blocks we need appropriate devata, to achieve this we must hav=\r\ne exact\n&gt; tools in the form of mantra, tantra, rituals etc; and at last gen=\r\neration of\n&gt; punya in real timeframe. \n&gt; \n&gt; Let us have a quick look at Nar=\r\nsimhji=E2=80=99s post on\n&gt; remedy for begetting a child. He has suggested m=\r\nain remedy as santangopal\n&gt; \n&gt; mantra a well known proven remedy. Why he su=\r\nggested\n&gt; that? If every mantra from his generic list can do this he should=\r\n have suggested\n&gt; any one. As per the shashtra the analogy should be like t=\r\nhis. Here we will\n&gt; sidetrack depth of karma as this is near impossible to =\r\nunderstand ???? ??????? [ gahanO karmagatI ], at least for me. Consider a\n&gt;=\r\n childless couple aged 35 years after ten yeas of marriage who desperately =\r\nneed\n&gt; a baby. Snatangopal is a specific form of Vishnu [ a mahadeity respo=\r\nnsible for\n&gt; sustenance of universe ] to bless childless with a baby, the m=\r\nantra itself is\n&gt; self explanatory as this aims at begetting child and the =\r\nmost imp it will\n&gt; generate punya in specific timeframe. Yes, every so call=\r\ned generic mantra is\n&gt; capable of giving everything to everybody but the ma=\r\nin hurdle is timeframe. If\n&gt; we do any sadhana for long time we accumulate =\r\npunya; energy to have all\n&gt; pleasures in the world whereas the use of this =\r\npunya depends upon the\n&gt; individual. In this case punya required to beget a=\r\n child is missing so we need\n&gt; that energy in real time frame as after 45/5=\r\n0 it is unlikely that lady will be\n&gt; capable of begetting a child. Yes, all=\r\n generic mantra will give child but in\n&gt; next birth as specific form of pun=\r\nya required to beget a baby will be\n&gt; accumulated after doing generic mantr=\r\na for long time rather whole life time. As\n&gt; said in vishnusahasranama coup=\r\nle will get all fruits in next birth including\n&gt; baby and major part of tha=\r\nt punya will be consumed for said cause of baby\n&gt; leaving small part for ot=\r\nher pleasures. If we use wooden hammer to fix a nail\n&gt; it might take one ho=\r\nur to finish job but metal hammer can do this in five\n&gt; minutes. This scien=\r\nce, not logic is behind different mantra, rituals sanctioned\n&gt; by sages for=\r\n different purposes as karma is never generic.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Narsihmaji you are=\r\n doing very noble karma in a\n&gt; sattvic manner so thousands will read you, h=\r\nundreds will follow you; so for\n&gt; them and to our scientific spiritual trad=\r\nition i think you should do justice by\n&gt; rethinking on this topic. I myself=\r\n read your spiritual post with respect but in\n&gt; this matter you miss the ta=\r\nrget.  \n&gt; \n&gt;                Yours sincerely\n&gt; \n&gt;                    Satish\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
