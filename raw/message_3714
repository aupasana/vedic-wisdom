One morning, around\n=\r\n10 a.m. he was on his way back from the temple tank at the Pachaiamman\nShri=\r\nne together with his companions Palaniswami, Vasudeva Sastri and others.\nTh=\r\nere they had taken an oil bath. The sun was by now burning hot and the\nasce=\r\nnt to Virupaksha Cave was causing additional strain. When they came near\nth=\r\ne Tortoise Rock, which is a huge boulder on the path, Ramana was suddenly\no=\r\nvercome by a bodily weakness. He supported himself against the rock. His\nsk=\r\nin turned dark and his companions thought he was going to die.\n\nVasudeva Sa=\r\nstri reports, =E2=80=9CWhile all else stood at a distance weeping,I\nsuddenl=\r\ny embraced him. I was a bachelor at the time and had the liberty to\ndo so. =\r\nNo one else used to touch Swami=E2=80=99s body. He was in that state for\nab=\r\nout ten minutes, I think, and then gained consciousness. I jumped about\nwit=\r\nh joy. =E2=80=98Why this weeping? You thought I was dead? If I am to die, w=\r\nill I\nnot tell you beforehand?=E2=80=99 Bhagavan said, consoling us.=E2=80=\r\n=9D\n\nRamana described his experience as follows, =E2=80=9CSuddenly the view=\r\n of nature in\nfront of me disappeared and got covered up like a sheet of wh=\r\nite cloth. =E2=80=A6\nAll around me was the view of the white cloth. My head=\r\n was reeling. The\ncirculation of blood and the beating of the heart stopped=\r\n, and my body began\nto get dark in colour, same as what happens to a dead b=\r\nody, and as that\nslowly increased, Vasu thought that I was really dead and =\r\nbegan to weep, and\nembraced me. The change in my body=E2=80=99s colour, Vas=\r\nu=E2=80=99s embrace, the shivering\nof his body, and the talks of the others=\r\n around me =E2=80=93 I was conscious of all\nthese. I was also conscious of =\r\nmy hands and feet getting chill, and the\nstopping of the beats of my heart,=\r\n but I had no fear in me. The flow of my\nthoughts and the consciousness of =\r\nmy self were not lost and I was not\nworried about my body=E2=80=99s conditi=\r\non.I sat cross-legged in the padmasanam pose\n[lotus seat]. I was not leanin=\r\ng on the rock behind. The circulation of blood\nstopped but the sitting post=\r\nure remained intact. All that lasted for about\nfifteen minutes. Suddenly en=\r\nergy permeated throughout my body.The\ncirculation of blood and the beating =\r\nof the heart commenced.The black colour\nof my body disappeared. I began to =\r\nperspire profusely from all pores in my\nbody. I opened my eyes, got up and =\r\nsaid: =E2=80=98Come on. Let us go.=E2=80=99 We then\nreached the Virupaksha =\r\nCave without any further incidents.=E2=80=9D\n\nIt is possible that this even=\r\nt allowed Ramana=E2=80=99s final transition to a normal\nouter life. One thi=\r\nng is certain, around this time his life started to\nfollow a normal path ag=\r\nain. This development had been gradual and had\nstarted to set in in the yea=\r\nrs leading up to this event. He had started to\nreact to visitors and had sl=\r\nowly started speaking again, although still very\nlittle. He ate and drank r=\r\negularly and took care of his body. He performed\nall kinds of domestic work=\r\n. He also carved many walking sticks, which he\nthen gave away, and likewise=\r\n spoons and cups which he carved out of coconut\nshells and then polished so=\r\n long that they started to shine. He developed a\ngood deal of practical abi=\r\nlity in daily life, became an extraordinarily good\nand painstaking cook, a =\r\ntalented architect and in all that he did was\nextremely economical and tidy=\r\n. Increasingly his life followed a precise\ntimetable, in which everything h=\r\nad its fixed place.\n\nSource: Ramana Maharshi: His Life A biography by Gabri=\r\nele Ebert\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=\r\n=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =\r\n =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=\r\n=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00032557e14a82acf7047f8a915a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;In 1912 Ramana had a kind of se=\r\ncond death experience.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0One morning, around 10 a.m. he was on hi=\r\ns way back from the temple tank at the Pachaiamman Shrine together with his=\r\n companions Palaniswami, Vasudeva Sastri and others.
