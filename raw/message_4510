If a big boulder is blockin=\r\ng the road, one cannot push it away just like that. One has to keep exertin=\r\ng force and push it persistently. Similarly, small problems are easy to sol=\r\nve.

Als=\r\no, many temples existed, where such priests, great yogis and rishis did sad=\r\nhana and left great energy. Thus, big kaarmik problems could also be solved=\r\n with one pooja, one homam, one abhishekam, one visit to a temple etc.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Such priests and temples are quite rare today. Do not expect one pooja, on=\r\ne archana, one homam or one abhishekam to solve problems.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, lit=\r\ntle bit at a time adds up over time.

When you say any ritual,=\r\n do you also mean rituals like archana and abhishegams that are performed i=\r\nn temples? \n&gt; &gt; Kindly clarify.\n&gt; &gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; &gt; Harish\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would still go to a priest for doing homam. Why ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Instead of going through an online manual I get a live person with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nexperience who can help me setup the homam the ingredients needed. Note\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; that most priests these days let YOU participate in the homam and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nconstantly guide you on every aspect of the homam. It just makes it more\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; convenient.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The catch is this: Doing a one-off homam (or any r=\r\nitual) once every 6 months or so is unlikely to cause any considerable mate=\r\nrial or spiritual benefit. Given the kind of kaarmik blockages most people =\r\nhave, persistent sadhana over a period of time is needed and one event cann=\r\not fix things.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As one does a sadhana (homam or japam or any ritual=\r\n) everyday or atleast every weekend, it will tilt the scales in one&#39;s favor=\r\n over the time and start fixing material problems and enabling one&#39;s spirit=\r\nual evolution.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one has access and is able to engage a priest ev=\r\neryday or every weekend, what you said is a fine strategy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One point I want to make is that priests may have fallen just lik=\r\ne rest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of us , but they are also human living in the same world or ra=\r\nther same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yuga as we are! I feel a priest with reasonable desires of =\r\ntaking care\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of his daily needs and his family need not be shunned alt=\r\nhough he is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing rituals for the sake of money/tips/gifts.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nAbsolutely. We should have nothing against them. Giving them money or helpi=\r\nng them or engaging them is perfectly noble. My only point is that *most* (=\r\nthough not all) of them have no ability to give a boost to the material and=\r\n spiritual pursuit of others (like many priests of old days did) and hence =\r\npeople should not leave the remedying of their problem completely to the pr=\r\niest (they are very likely to be disappointed that way). If they realize th=\r\nat they are on their own and do something about it, they are more likely to=\r\n succeed over time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jyotisha readings that you talk=\r\n about the end are a different ball game. They are mostly an intellectual e=\r\nxercise and can be done well by one without spiritual energy. But, doing a =\r\nritual for someone and giving a boost to one&#39;s material and spiritual pursu=\r\nits (using one&#39;s own spiritual energy by using the ritual as a tool) is a s=\r\npiritual exercise and one without a good level of spiritual energy cannot d=\r\no it well. These days, people hardly have enough spiritual energy to fix th=\r\neir own blockages and how can they take care of others?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I apologize if I offended you. I&#39;m a nobody compared to you.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; No offense taken.
