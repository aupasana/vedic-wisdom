Kudos to my friend & guide\n(and my undergraduat=\r\ne classmate), PVR Narasimha Rao, for his yeoman&#39;s\nservice in founding & she=\r\npherding this group.\nSharing with you a fascinating article on the signific=\r\nance of today&#39;s\ndate (9.9.9) by Carl Johan Calleman, an expert on the Mayan=\r\n Calendar,\nwhom I met a couple of weeks ago at a conference in Washington D=\r\nC.Best,\nSanjay\n\n--\nSanjay Kadaveru\nWashington DC\n       9.9.9. and the Maya=\r\nn Calendar\n\nThe number nine has been endowed with a special significance in=\r\n many\ndifferent spiritual and religious traditions. Nine was the number of\n=\r\nmuses in Greek mythology and Nine were the number of worlds in the\nScandina=\r\nvian. Nine was the number of doors to the holiest part of the\ntemple in Jer=\r\nusalem and the month of Ramadan is the Ninth in the Muslim\ncalendar. Moreov=\r\ner, the counting system used by most of the world today\nincludes nine numbe=\r\nrs and so the relevance of this number is much\ningrained in us. Also, in th=\r\ne Mayan tradition the number Nine plays a\npredominating role. The only exis=\r\nting inscription from ancient times\nthat discusses the meaning of the Mayan=\r\n calendar &quot;end date&quot; for\ninstance speaks of Nine &quot;deities&quot; that will descen=\r\nd then as its\ncrucial event. This would in modern wording mean that Nine en=\r\nergies\n&lt;http://calleman.com/content/articles/the_tortuguero+_monument.htm&gt; =\r\n, or\nNine cosmic forces would fully manifest then since the ancient Maya\nwo=\r\nuld look upon time periods as &quot;deities&quot;. As far as we can tell\nthese &quot;deiti=\r\nes&quot;, or cosmic forces, are like evolutionary wave\nmovements, built on top o=\r\nf one another where we are currently riding on\nthe eighth one getting ready=\r\n to ride o n20the ninth.\n\n\nThe Nine Cosmic levels (Underworlds) that accord=\r\ning to the only existing\nMayan inscription about the calendar end date (Tor=\r\ntuguero monument 6)\nwill manifest then. Currently we are in the eighth leve=\r\nl (The Galactic\nUnderworld) gearing up to the Ninth and highest level, the =\r\nUniversal\nUnderworld. Photo of the Pyramid of the Jaguar in Tikal by the au=\r\nthor.)\nIn the manifestation of these evolutionary waves we may now as we\nap=\r\nproach the Ninth level notice an amazing synchronicity. This is that\nthe up=\r\ncoming date 9.9.9 (September 9, 2009 in the Gregorian calendar)\nhappens to =\r\ncoincide with the beginning of a Mayan Sacred Calendar count\nof 260 days. H=\r\nence, in this calendar, in use since 3000 years, the\nmodern date 9.9.9 has =\r\nthe energy of Hun Imix, or 1 Alligator as its\nEnglish translation reads, wh=\r\nich happens to be the first of its\nenergetic combinations. If we ponder wha=\r\nt this synchronicity may be\ntelling us the most natural conclusion to draw =\r\nis that on this\nparticular date we are called to focus on the number nine a=\r\nnd especially\nthe Ninth level of the Mayan calendar system, whose coming in=\r\nto\nexistence we are soon about to witness.   I believe that behind these\nco=\r\nsmic forces, whose times of activation ar e described by the Mayan\ncalendar=\r\n, is an intell igent plan for the history of humanity that comes\nfrom a hig=\r\nher source and has a benevolent intention. To realize this is\nalso to under=\r\nstand the importance of the guidance regarding how to\nfollow this plan that=\r\n we may gain from the calendar of the Maya. These\nnine cosmic forces are in=\r\nfluencing and in fact governing our collective\nconsciousness and so we have=\r\n every reason to pay attention to what is\ngoing on in this cosmic time plan=\r\n.   Synchronicities can often be\ninterpreted in different ways, but if they=\r\n are profound they always\ndeserve our attention. 9.9.9, three Nines in a ro=\r\nw, may for instance be\nseen as symbolic of three sacred calendar rounds of =\r\n260 days that will\nnow in three steps lead us to the completion of the Nint=\r\nh level of\nevolution which is its highest level. To the best of our knowled=\r\nge this\nhighest energy state of the universe will be attained on the energy=\r\n\n13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13 13 Ahau (13 and Ahau are symbols of\ncompletion =\r\nin the Mayan calendar) on the Gregorian date October 28,\n2011. This highest=\r\n state does not in any sense mean the end of the\nworld, but only that all t=\r\nhe Nine wave movements are then completed.\nMaybe we can use the metaphor th=\r\nat we are now about to climb the last\nhard steps of a ladder until we climb=\r\n on to the roof where we will find\na new stability under our feet and a pla=\r\nce to rest.  Regardless of what\nthis final climb will mean=3D2 0we thus hav=\r\ne reasons to expect an\nunprecedented period of change in a very short perio=\r\nd of time. This is\npartly because we are entering the final phase of the ei=\r\nghth level of\nevolution and partly because a wave movement of a very high f=\r\nrequency,\nthe Ninth level, will radically come to transform the collective\n=\r\nconsciousness in such a way that we will see the world in an entirely\ndiffe=\r\nrent light. It is for this reason that in the three upcoming Sacred\nCalenda=\r\nr rounds that follow upon 9.9.9 we will need to network and focus\nour inten=\r\ntions so that they converge in the birth of a new world. This\nis all the mo=\r\nre important as there are several sources that seem to\nindicate that the si=\r\nxth night of the Galactic Underworld, beginning on\nNovember 8, 2009, may co=\r\nme to generate a deep downturn in the\nworld&#39;s economy. The first of these 2=\r\n60-day Sacred Calendar rounds,\nthe one which actually begins on 9.9.9 and g=\r\noes on until May 26, 2010,\nmay be seen as a period of build-up to the Ninth=\r\n level that is suitable\nfor prayer, meditation and mental focusing. We enco=\r\nurage community\nbuilding, networking and spiritual synchronization in this =\r\ntime period,\nalso of a practical nature. The second 260 calendar round, sta=\r\nrting\n27.05.10 will create a preliminary arrival of the Ninth level and the=\r\n\nbeginning of this will be marked by the Cosmic Convergence, July 17-18,\na =\r\nsignificant focus point for spiritual projects of a practical nature\nthat w=\r\nill prepare f or the birth of a new world. The third Sacred\nCalendar round =\r\nof 260 days will begin February 11, 2011 and includes the\nactual activation=\r\n of the Ninth level, the Universal Underworld on March\n8, 2011. This may be=\r\n the most dramatic of the three steps as it leads up\nto the establishment o=\r\nf the highest energy state of the universe on\nOctober 28, 2011.\nI believe t=\r\nhat through these three steps, three Sacred Calendar rounds,\nstarting on 9.=\r\n9.9: 1/ Build-up, 2/ Preparatory Ninth level and 3/ Actual\nNinth level of t=\r\nhe evolution of the cosmos, the universe is now about to\ndeliver what it ha=\r\ns been striving towards all along, the establishment\nof a new level of cons=\r\nciousness, a unity consciousness. I also believe\nthat the Ninth level is de=\r\nsigned especially to generate such a unity\nconsciousness, which will transf=\r\norm all of human society. For the human\nrace it will mean very big challeng=\r\nes and opportunities. These changes\nwill however not happen by themselves a=\r\nnd need to be manifested by the\nhuman beings themselves who may then chose =\r\nto resist or welcome them.\nFrom this perspective we may thus look at the da=\r\nte 9.9.9 not only as a\nnumerological curiosity to celebrate, but also as an=\r\n opportunity for us\nto focus on and embrace the participation of humanity i=\r\nn a\ntransformation process of a very large scale, the one brought by the\nNi=\r\nnth level of the Cosmos. From what we may understand of the Mayan\ncalendar =\r\nthe unity20consciousness will set an end to all forms of\ndominance of one h=\r\numan over another and especially those generated by\nthe left brain. What th=\r\nis likely will mean is that instruments of\ndominance, such as the current f=\r\ninancial system, weapons, national\nborders and many other structures uphold=\r\ning authority in this process\nwill come to crumble as an effect of this uni=\r\nty consciousness coming\ninto existence and so conclude with the birth of a =\r\nnew world where a\ndivine harmony characterize the human relations. This end=\r\n to dominance\nwill also affect the relationship between the genders on a gl=\r\nobal scale\nthat as a result will profoundly shift. Needless to say, there w=\r\nill\nnever be any return to business as usual. Instead we will need to\nappro=\r\nach the birth of the new world consciously and with an intention of\nco-crea=\r\nting it in a positive sense and not just react to the various\ndifficulties =\r\nthat lie ahead. I believe that such a collective intention\nof co-creating t=\r\nhe new world will be the best way of easing the\nconsequences of these diffi=\r\nculties.\nAlthough what is starting on 9.9.9 is only the build-up phase to t=\r\nhe\nNinth level, this date is nonetheless a very important focusing point\nsi=\r\nnce the timing of the continued preparations for the emergence of this\nleve=\r\nl are of the essence. From20this follows that the more practical\nprojects t=\r\nhat will start to manifest in the Cosmic Convergence, July\n17-18 2010 as th=\r\ne name implies, will have to be bas ed on an\nunderstanding that the very fr=\r\namework of the human existence and of\nconsciousness will be dramatically ex=\r\npanded. The expansion of human\nconsciousness is what will bring the socio-e=\r\nconomic transformation at a\ntime when the hardships of the old systems may =\r\nbe expected to be\npainfully felt also by nations that currently may been co=\r\nnsidered as\nwealthy. As the Ninth level is finally activated our identities=\r\n will\ncome to be defined in a much expanded spiritual framework. This artic=\r\nle\ncomes much too late to encourage people more broadly to focus and intend=\r\n\ntogether for the future. Nonetheless, many will celebrate the 9.9.9 date\nr=\r\negardless (see for example http://www.fredpajorden.se/sida21.html \n&lt;http://=\r\nwww.fredpajorden.se/sida21.html&gt; ). The purpose of my present\narticle is th=\r\nen only to inform those that will be celebrating this date\nanyway, that ind=\r\need this is not just a numerological curiosity in the\nGregorian calendar, b=\r\nut that the date plays a profound objective role in\nthe cosmic plan as we m=\r\nay understand this from the Mayan calendar\ndirectly leading up to the birth=\r\n of a new world through the Ninth level,\n9.9.9. It is an ideal time to part=\r\nicipate in prayers and meditations\nwith the focus and intention of co-creat=\r\ning a new and20better world.\nAdditional tools for networking and communicat=\r\nion with the focus on the\nCosmic Convergence, July 17-18, 2012 will be deve=\r\nloped as we go along.\n9.9.9 may b e seen as an initial and modest initial c=\r\nall for the\nco-creation of the birth of a new world.\nMalm=F6, September 6, =\r\n2009 (11 Edznab)\nCarl Johan Calleman\n\r\n--3-3390280575-5353895757=:1\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot;&gt;Greetings!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nThis is my first post to the vedic-wisdom group.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I have enjoyed the =\r\nenlightening posts &amp; discussions on this group ever since becoming a me=\r\nmber earlier this summer.

This is that the upcoming date 9.9.9 (September 9, 2009 in th=\r\ne Gregorian calendar) happens to coincide with the beginning of a Mayan Sac=\r\nred Calendar count of 260 days. Hence, in this calendar, in use since 3000 =\r\nyears, the modern date 9.9.9 has the energy of Hun Imix, or 1 Alligator as =\r\nits English translation reads, which happens to be the first of its energet=\r\nic combinations. If we ponder what this synchronicity may be telling us the=\r\n most natural conclusion to draw is that on this particular date we are cal=\r\nled to focus on the number nine and especially the Ninth level of the Mayan=\r\n calendar system, whose coming into existence we are soon about to witness.=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT col=\r\nor=3D&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;I believe that behind these cosmic forces, whose times =\r\nof activation ar e described by the Mayan calendar, is an intell igent plan=\r\n for the history of humanity that comes from a higher source and has a bene=\r\nvolent intention.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt; To realize this is also to understand the =\r\nimportance of the guidance regarding how to follow this plan that we may ga=\r\nin from the calendar of the Maya.

To the best of our knowledge this highest energy state=\r\n of the universe will be attained on the energy 13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13.13 =\r\n13 Ahau (13 and Ahau are symbols of completion in the Mayan calendar) on th=\r\ne Gregorian date October 28, 2011. This highest state does not in any sense=\r\n mean the end of the world, but only that all the Nine wave movements are t=\r\nhen completed.

This may =\r\nbe the most dramatic of the three steps as it leads up to the establishment=\r\n of the highest energy state of the universe on October 28, 2011.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I believe that through these three steps, three Sacred=\r\n Calendar rounds, starting on 9.9.9: 1/ Build-up, 2/ Preparatory Ninth leve=\r\nl and 3/ Actual Ninth level of the evolution of the cosmos, the universe is=\r\n now about to deliver what it has been striving towards all along, the esta=\r\nblishment of a new level of consciousness, a unity consciousness. I also be=\r\nlieve that the Ninth level is designed especially to generate such a unity =\r\nconsciousness, which will transform all of human society. For the human rac=\r\ne it will mean very big challenges and opportunities. These changes will ho=\r\nwever not happen by themselves and need to be manifested by the human being=\r\ns themselves who may then chose to resist or welcome them. &lt;FONT color=3D&quot;m=\r\nidnightblue&quot;&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;B&gt;From this perspective we may thus look at the date 9.9.9=\r\n not only as a numerological curiosity to celebrate, but also as an opportu=\r\nnity for us to focus on and embrace the participation of humanity in a tran=\r\nsformation process of a very large scale,&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/U&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;the one brought by=\r\n the Ninth level of the Cosmos.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;From what we may =\r\nunderstand of the Mayan calendar the unity20consciousness will set an end t=\r\no all forms of dominance of one human over another and especially those gen=\r\nerated by the left brain. What this likely will mean is that instruments of=\r\n dominance, such as the current financial system, weapons, national borders=\r\n and many other structures upholding authority in this process will come to=\r\n crumble as an effect of this unity consciousness coming into existence and=\r\n so conclude with the birth of a new world where a divine harmony character=\r\nize the human relations. This end to dominance will also affect the relatio=\r\nnship between the genders on a global scale that as a result will profoundl=\r\ny shift. Needless to say, there will never be any return to business as usu=\r\nal. Instead &lt;FONT color=3D&quot;midnightblue&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;&lt;I&gt;&lt;U&gt;we will need to approach =\r\nthe birth of the new world consciously and with an intention of co-creating=\r\n it in a positive sense&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;and not just react to the variou=\r\ns difficulties that lie ahead. I believe that such a collective intention o=\r\nf co-creating the new world will be the best way of easing the consequences=\r\n of these difficulties.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Although what is star=\r\nting on 9.9.9 is only the build-up phase to the Ninth level, this date is n=\r\nonetheless a very important focusing point since the timing of the continue=\r\nd preparations for the emergence of this level are of the essence. From20th=\r\nis follows that the more practical projects that will start to manifest in =\r\nthe Cosmic Convergence, July 17-18 2010 as the name implies, will have to b=\r\ne bas ed on an understanding that the very framework of the human existence=\r\n and of consciousness will be dramatically expanded. &lt;B&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;FONT color=3D&quot;m=\r\nidnightblue&quot;&gt;The expansion of human consciousness is what will bring the so=\r\ncio-economic transformation at a time when the hardships of the old systems=\r\n may be expected to be painfully felt also by nations that currently may be=\r\nen considered as wealthy. As the Ninth level is finally activated our ident=\r\nities will come to be defined in a much expanded spiritual framework.&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/B&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;This article comes much too late to enc=\r\nourage people more broadly to focus and intend together for the future. Non=\r\netheless, many will celebrate the 9.9.9 date regardless &lt;I&gt;(see for example=\r\n &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.fredpajorden.se/sida21.html&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;&gt;http://www.fredpajorden.se/&lt;WBR&gt;sida21.html &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;)=\r\n&lt;/I&gt;. The purpose of my present article is then only to inform those that w=\r\nill be celebrating this date anyway, that indeed this is not just a numerol=\r\nogical curiosity in the Gregorian calendar, but that the date plays a profo=\r\nund objective role in the cosmic plan as we may understand this from the Ma=\r\nyan calendar directly leading up to the birth of a new world through the Ni=\r\nnth level, 9.9.9. It is an ideal time to participate in prayers and meditat=\r\nions with the focus and intention of co-creating a new and20better world. A=\r\ndditional tools for networking and communication with the focus on the Cosm=\r\nic Convergence, July 17-18, 2012 will be developed as we go along. 9.9.9 ma=\r\ny b e seen as an initial and modest initial call for the co-creation of the=\r\n birth of a new world.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV align=3D&quot;left&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Malm=F6, September 6, =\r\n2009 (11 Edznab)&lt;BR&gt;Carl Johan Calleman&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n\r\n--3-3390280575-5353895757=:1--\r\n\n"}}
