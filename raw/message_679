One of them from the Shiva Maha Puran\nstates =\r\nthat Bhairava was created from the third eye of Shiva to cut off\none of the=\r\n heads of Brahma. Thus Bhairava became the first person to\ncommit the sin o=\r\nf Brahmahatya. Later he had to take a human skull as a\nbegging bowl and roa=\r\nmaround the earth untill finally when he reached\nKasi, the skull fell from =\r\nhis hand and Lord Bhairava was liberated from\nthe sin of brahmahatya. Thus =\r\nhe became the protector of the lord city of\nKasi. It is believed, anyone wh=\r\no goes to Kasi to visit Kasi Vishwanath,\nshould also pay his/her respect to=\r\n KalBhairav.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Another story, the 51 shakti peethas, where the body o=\r\nf Sati had\nfallen are guarded by Shiva in his Bhairava roopa.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; Bhair=\r\nav is often refered to as the deity of the Samshan (Shiva in his\nsashan roo=\r\npa) as well as Kshetrapala. Or protector of the field\n&quot;kshetra&quot;. That is wh=\r\ny Vatuka Bhairava (Vatuka meaning small child) is\noften invoked for protect=\r\nion during many rituals in the samshan.\n&gt; On the esoteric level, the kshetr=\r\na is the field, the body. That is\nwhere Durga/Kali resides in the form of t=\r\nhe kundalini. And Shiva as\nBhairava acts as the protector of the fortress o=\r\nf the Goddess. Hence, in\nsome tantrik traditions, Bhairava is also refered =\r\nto as a son of Kali.\nOr in other words, one who has been intoxicated into G=\r\nod conscinousness\nby the Kundalini energy may act and behave like Bhairava =\r\nin appearence\n(nothing material will appeal to him anymore). Therefore they=\r\n say, one\nwho can get the real=C2 grace of the divine mother is not a sadha=\r\nk ( a\nsadhak gets maybe one or two aspects of the Mother depending on the\ns=\r\nadhana), but a=C2 son or=C2 daughter of the Mother. =C2\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; In Kashmiri=\r\n traditions, Bhairav holds a very important place. He is\nconsidered to be t=\r\nhe all in all deity who creates, maintains and then\ndestroyes. He is the pu=\r\nre conscinousness where all duality is broken\ndown and hence is so fierce f=\r\nor ordinay mortals like us who are so\naccustomed to existence within=C2 dua=\r\nlity. The Rudrayamala tantra=C2\ncontains some=C2 very strong descriptions o=\r\nf Lord Bhairava, including\nhis various roops, his shaktis. There is a beaut=\r\niful hymn of Kal\nBhairava as composd by Adi Shankarachrya.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; All that=\r\n I mentioned above is what I have understood from a=C2\ntheoritcal point of =\r\nview regarding Lord Bhairava. I had been given a\nmantra of lord Bhairav thr=\r\nough a strange set of events by a person, and\nsince then I had been praying=\r\n to Him. Before that day, I had never even\nheard of the name Bhairava. He h=\r\nad told me one more thing, the key to\ndoing any genuine sadhana of Bhairava=\r\n entails facing and eventually\nlosing once fears.\n&gt;\n&gt; Often people have str=\r\nong misconceptions about Lord Bhairava\nconsidering Him to be=C2 one=C2 asso=\r\nciated with black magik or such.\nAll those are quite incorrect.\n&gt; =C2\n&gt; -Re=\r\ngards\n&gt; =C2 Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;This above all: to thine own self be true!&quot; - H=\r\namlet\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Wed, 19/11/08, Reema Patel Sriganesh reema_sriganesh@... w=\r\nrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Reema Patel Sriganesh reema_sriganesh@...\n&gt; Subject: [vedic=\r\n-wisdom] Who is Bhairava (was Re: Homa)\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n=\r\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, 19 November, 2008, 12:49 PM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; || Om Sri Guru=\r\nbhyo Namah ||\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaskaar Narasimha Ji,\n&gt;\n&gt; Your explanation of duality a=\r\nnd non-duality by the way of example of\nthe offerings to the Homa is just e=\r\nxcellent!

But do not use hom=\r\nam fire to make the offering.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Another type of fire called kravyaada=\r\n (funeral pyre) or ripravaaha\n(carrier\n&gt; &gt; of impurities) can be used to ca=\r\nrry anything, without restrictions.\nHowever,\n&gt; &gt; this fire is not used in h=\r\nomam.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; A few deities such as Smashaana Taaraa and Smashaana Kaali ma=\r\ny be\nworshipped\n&gt; &gt; on a funeral pyre with any materials. However, such rit=\r\nuals are not\n&gt; &gt; appropriate for 99.99999999% people. Those are only for pe=\r\nople who\nalready\n&gt; &gt; have a very high level of detachment and a very low le=\r\nvel of\ndistinction\n&gt; &gt; between the polarities of duality, i.e. people who h=\r\nave a very low\nlevel of\n&gt; &gt; mental distinction between things normally cons=\r\nidered highly pure\nand things\n&gt; &gt; normally considered highly impure and see=\r\n all as One. As a result of\ntheir\n&gt; &gt; worship on funeral pyre, they may get=\r\n results that are normally\nconsidered\n&gt; &gt; good or results that are normally=\r\n considered terrible, but again\ntheir\n&gt; &gt; mental distinction between good a=\r\nnd bad results is very low and they\naccept\n&gt; &gt; all results with an equal vi=\r\nsion. Rituals practiced by such aghoris\nare\n&gt; &gt; aimed at honing their detac=\r\nhment and non-distinction to further\nperfection.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Such aghora practi=\r\nces are not to be done out of &quot;fascination&quot; or\nbecause\n&gt; &gt; they seem or sou=\r\nnd &quot;cool&quot;. That is a formula for failure and\ndisaster. For\n&gt; &gt; the majority=\r\n of us who are still deeply affected by the polarities\nof\n&gt; &gt; duality and c=\r\nannot see all things equally, worship of any deity in\nfuneral\n&gt; &gt; pyre is a=\r\n strict no-no. Stick to regular homam and maintain basic\npurity, no\n&gt; &gt; mat=\r\nter which deity you worship in the fire. In that case, throwing\nchillies,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; meat and alcohol in fire is a strict no-no. Unfortunately, some\npeople d=\r\no\n&gt; &gt; not realize it and throw these things in their homam fire. This is a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; terrible thing to do.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; People in this age foolishly mix up princ=\r\niples of duality and\nnon-duality..\n&gt; &gt; Principles of non-duality like &quot;all =\r\nis god&quot; are applicable only if\nyou can\n&gt; &gt; see god in pleasure and pain and=\r\n accept both the same way. If\npleasure and\n&gt; &gt; pain are two distinct feelin=\r\ngs for you and you prefer one to the\nother, then\n&gt; &gt; you are immersed in du=\r\nality and follow the principles of duality\nwithout\n&gt; &gt; mixing up non-dual p=\r\nrinciples and pretending &quot;all is god&quot;. All is\nNOT god\n&gt; &gt; for you then.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Offering alcohol, meat, chillies etc in homam can bring terrible\nresul=\r\nts to\n&gt; &gt; one. One whose karmic pipeline is very short may experience the\nr=\r\nesults\n&gt; &gt; immediately, but most people do not experience right away. As a\n=\r\nresult, they\n&gt; &gt; do not realize what a terrible thing they are doing.

That fire can carry vari=\r\nous &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; auspicious substances to various deities, but does NOT li=\r\nke to carry stuff &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; like alcohol and meat, even if a deity is w=\r\nilling to receive the offering.. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If you want to offer alcohol=\r\n to a deity such as Bhairava, call the deity in &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; an idol or a =\r\nkalasha (pot) or in an animal and then make the offering of &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; a=\r\nlcohol. But do not use homam fire to make the offering.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; Another type of fire called kravyaada (funeral pyre) or ripravaaha =\r\n(carrier &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of impurities) can be used to carry anything, withou=\r\nt restrictions. However, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; this fire is not used in homam.&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; A few deities such as Smashaana Taaraa and Smashaana=\r\n Kaali may be worshipped &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; on a funeral pyre with any materials=\r\n. However, such rituals are not &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; appropriate for 99.99999999% =\r\npeople. Those are only for people who already &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; have a very hig=\r\nh level of detachment and a very low level of distinction &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; bet=\r\nween the polarities of duality, i.e. people who have a very low level of &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; mental distinction between things normally considered highly pu=\r\nre and things &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; normally considered highly impure and see all a=\r\ns One. As a result of their &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; worship on funeral pyre, they may=\r\n get results that are normally considered &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; good or results tha=\r\nt are normally considered terrible, but again their &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; mental di=\r\nstinction between good and bad results is very low and they accept &lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; all results with an equal vision. Rituals practiced by such aghoris a=\r\nre &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; aimed at honing their detachment and non-distinction to fu=\r\nrther perfection.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Such aghora practices are not =\r\nto be done out of &quot;fascination&quot; or because &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; they seem or sound=\r\n &quot;cool&quot;. That is a formula for failure and disaster. For &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; the =\r\nmajority of us who are still deeply affected by the polarities of &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; duality and cannot see all things equally, worship of any deity in fun=\r\neral &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; pyre is a strict no-no. Stick to regular homam and maint=\r\nain basic purity, no &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; matter which deity you worship in the fi=\r\nre. In that case, throwing chillies, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; meat and alcohol in fire=\r\n is a strict no-no. Unfortunately, some people do &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; not realize=\r\n it and throw these things in their homam fire. This is a &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ter=\r\nrible thing to do.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; People in this age foolishly =\r\nmix up principles of duality and non-duality.. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Principles of =\r\nnon-duality like &quot;all is god&quot; are applicable only if you can &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nsee god in pleasure and pain and accept both the same way. If pleasure and =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; pain are two distinct feelings for you and you prefer one to =\r\nthe other, then &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; you are immersed in duality and follow the pr=\r\ninciples of duality without &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; mixing up non-dual principles and=\r\n pretending &quot;all is god&quot;. All is NOT god &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; for you then.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Offering alcohol, meat, chillies etc in homam can brin=\r\ng terrible results to &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; one. One whose karmic pipeline is very =\r\nshort may experience the results &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; immediately, but most people=\r\n do not experience right away. As a result, they &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; do not reali=\r\nze what a terrible thing they are doing. My humble request to &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n everybody who performs homam is to stay away from using such taamasik &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; materials.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- -&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst ro=\r\nloger.org/ homam&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicA=\r\nst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com=\r\n/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedic=\r\nastro. home.comcast. net&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http=\r\n://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website=\r\n: http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Origina=\r\nl Message ----- &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; rajarshi14@yahoo. co.in&gt=\r\n;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Sent=\r\n: Monday, November 17, 2008 2:38 AM&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Ho=\r\nma&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; I was seeing a homa being done by a person where alcohol was b=\r\neing&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; offered in the fire.
