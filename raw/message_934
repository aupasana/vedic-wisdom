I am still not satis=\r\nfied with \nthe answer though, especially since I am sure I can get a lot mo=\r\nre \nout of you :-)\n\nSee, the explanation that &quot;repetitive chanting calms/an=\r\nchors the \nmind&quot; is only a &quot;placebo&quot; of an answer. It does not do any justi=\r\nce \nto the obviously highly nuanced mantra shastra. If all repetitive \nchan=\r\nting were equal, mantra shastra would be 1/2 a page of text, not \nmore. So =\r\nthis explanation does nothing more than appease the \natheistic scientific m=\r\nind, one that is unwilling to consider (let \nalone accept) the non-material=\r\n part of the universe.\n\nI am looking for a deeper answer that addresses the=\r\n above concerns. \nPlease bear with me in reading the following paragraph in=\r\n its \nentirety before replying - I know I am not presenting new \ninformatio=\r\nn to you, but merely presenting things as I know them, so \nyou may reply/co=\r\nrrect my thinking as appropriate:  More \nspecifically, when I read Vivekacu=\r\ndamani, I am led to believe that \nthe manifested universe is all and only t=\r\nhe quintuplicated tattwas. \nThe gross human being is no different (i.e. is =\r\nalso quintuplicated \ntattwas), but his consciousness is the link to a deepe=\r\nr non-material \nuniverse. In that deeper universe, which is the source of t=\r\nhe \nmaterial universe, there is the subtle body, which has, among other \nth=\r\nings, the antahakarana, which has the \nreflecting/considering/theorizing mi=\r\nnd that we are all so familiar \nwith. It experiences the quintuplicated uni=\r\nverse, yet is directly \npart of the unquintuplicated universe! At an even d=\r\neeper level, even \nthis subtle body is a manifestation of the causal body -=\r\n mahat, \nwhich consists of the three gunas. The manifesting/enlivening agen=\r\nt, \nso to speak, is the non-dual Brahman, or pure undifferentiated \nconscio=\r\nusness.\n\nNow, in the above scheme of things, how do mantra and diety figure=\r\n? \nSpoken/chanted/heard mantra is nothing more than an &quot;energic&quot; \nactivity =\r\nof the most external part of the universe i.e. the \nquintuplicated tattwa u=\r\nniverse. Clearly this energic activity by \nitself, *if* limited to the quin=\r\ntuplicated universe, is useless. So, \nclearly, we must accept that if mantr=\r\na is to have ANY enlightening \neffect, mantra must resonate in the mind its=\r\nelf, which is part of \nthe antahakarana. Right? Now, since mind itself is N=\r\nON-material, \nwhat does resonate mean at the mind level? We are no longer t=\r\nalking \nabout physical energy (sound), we are talking of non-material menta=\r\nl \nenergy - the mental equivalent of sound in the mind.\n\nIt is this non-mat=\r\nerial mental energy that I wish to understand when \nI ask about mantras and=\r\n beejaksharas. What is this energy? Is it \ntattwa, prana, chitta, ahamkara,=\r\n manas, karma, what? Why do specific \nharmonics of it correspond to specifi=\r\nc dieties? What exactly *is* a \ndiety in terms of the above terminology? Wh=\r\nat is the cause-effect \nrelationship between harmonics of this energy and t=\r\nhe disintegration \nof the subtle and causal bodies.\n\nHope you appreciate th=\r\ne direction/thrust of my querying..\n\nSincerely,\n\nSundeep\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; \n&lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Sun=\r\ndeep,\n&gt; \n&gt; This is quite relevant and not at all inappropriate. Let me give=\r\n \nthe crux of \n&gt; the philosophy.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; The mind is =\r\nlike a monkey. It wanders from one place to another \nvery rapidly \n&gt; and gi=\r\nves varied emotions such as pride, shame, anger, sadness \netc. When the \n&gt; =\r\nmind becomes nearly calm, steady and stable, one can experience \nthe bliss =\r\nof \n&gt; finding the true Self. The goal of all spiritual sadhana - japam, \nho=\r\nmam, \n&gt; dhyanam, contemplation and various rituals - is to enable the mind =\r\n\nto become \n&gt; calm.\n&gt; \n&gt; At first, one cannot make the mind stable and calm=\r\n. All one can do \nit to tie \n&gt; the monkey (mind) to a fixed pole (mantra). =\r\nThe monkey still moves \naround, \n&gt; but its motion is restricted. Once it go=\r\nes far, the thread tying \nit to the \n&gt; pole stops it from going further awa=\r\ny. Similarly, when one tries \nto focus on \n&gt; a mantra and one&#39;s mind wander=\r\ns to other things, one constantly \nbrings it \n&gt; back to the mantra and thus=\r\n one&#39;s mind tries to stay on the mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, mantra is an anchor for=\r\n the mind to focus on when it tries \nto become \n&gt; calm and stable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aft=\r\ner trying enough, just as monkey tied to a pole may stop \njumping around \n&gt;=\r\n and fall asleep holding on to the pole, the mind may stop thinking \nof so =\r\n\n&gt; many things and become absolutely calm and stable while repeating \na man=\r\ntra. \n&gt; When all the thoughts cease and some level of silence comes to the =\r\n\nmind, one \n&gt; experiences some level of bliss.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Thus, mantra is a combination of sounds that is repeated by the \nmind to =\r\naid \n&gt; mind to stop wandering from one thing to another thing. The goal \nis=\r\n to give \n&gt; an anchor for the mind to focus on, instead of jumping everywhe=\r\nre.\n&gt; \n&gt; Various sound combinations can be used for this purpose. For \nexam=\r\nple, one \n&gt; can even repeat &quot;I want to find true Self&quot; constantly. Every \nc=\r\nombination of \n&gt; sounds is capable of making the mind calm after repeating =\r\nit \nenough. Sound \n&gt; patterns making sense in various languages were used b=\r\ny some \nsaints and \n&gt; messiahs from time to time in the past to obtain blis=\r\ns and those \nsound \n&gt; patterns are revered as being sacred in various relig=\r\nions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Compared to long sequence of sounds, short sound patterns are \ne=\r\nasier to \n&gt; focus the mind on. If you repeat a mantra with 32 or 24 \nletter=\r\ns/syllables, a \n&gt; part of the mind is responsible for changing from one let=\r\nter to \nanother and \n&gt; there is more mind activity even in a state of high =\r\nmental focus \non the \n&gt; mantra. If you repeat a single syllable constantly,=\r\n the task is \nsimpler for \n&gt; the mind and it is easier for the mind to shut=\r\n down various tasks \nof the \n&gt; mind and become close to being still and sil=\r\nent.\n&gt; \n&gt; Various syllables can be used for this purpose. These syllables \n=\r\nare called \n&gt; beeja aksharas.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Beeja means a s=\r\need. Beeja  akshara means a seed syllable.\n&gt; \n&gt; When mind has absolutely no=\r\n activity and becomes completely still \n(i.e. \n&gt; ceases to exist!), one rea=\r\nlizes the true Self (Aatman or Brahman). \nWhen mind \n&gt; has very little acti=\r\nvity and becomes nearly still (i.e. still \nexists, but in \n&gt; a very high st=\r\nate of focus and calmness), one realizes different \npure \n&gt; manifestations =\r\nof cosmic being.\n&gt; \n&gt; When one meditates on a beeja akshara and attains the=\r\n above state \nof high \n&gt; mental focus and calmness, one&#39;s mind has no thoug=\r\nhts other than \nthe \n&gt; repetition of the syllable. Each syllable acts as a =\r\nseed \ncorresponding to a \n&gt; deity. The energy of that deity fills one&#39;s con=\r\nsciousness when \none&#39;s mind is \n&gt; filled with that syllable and has no othe=\r\nr thoughts in it. In \nother words, \n&gt; each deity is a personifications of t=\r\nhe state of a mind that is \nfocused on \n&gt; the sound of a specific beeja wit=\r\nh no other thoughts in it.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, if one&#39;=\r\ns mind has many thoughts while repeating a beeja \nakshara \n&gt; (or any mantra=\r\n in general), one may experience a lot of emotions \nand things. \n&gt; But, whe=\r\nn one&#39;s mind becomes nearly still and calm with no thought \nin it \n&gt; (other=\r\n than what is needed for repeating that sound), we can say \nthat one&#39;s \n&gt; i=\r\nndividual ego has been replaced with that of a deity and the \ndeity has \n&gt; =\r\nfilled one&#39;s mind.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, focused meditation on a beeja akshara can mak=\r\ne one \nexperience the \n&gt; energy of a deity.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\nhich syllables make one experience which energy was well-\nunderstood and \n&gt;=\r\n catalogued by ancient Hindu sages nicely.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many mantras other than bee=\r\nja aksharas were also experiemented by \nrishis, \n&gt; who understood the natur=\r\ne of energy experienced by one&#39;s mind when \none&#39;s \n&gt; mind is completely fil=\r\nled with the sound of the mantra and all \nother \n&gt; thoughts leave the mind.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; So we need not experiment newly. We can use the knowledge \ndiscovered=\r\n by \n&gt; rishis and go further.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Y=\r\nourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.hom=\r\ne.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; --=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----=\r\n- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; Dear all,\n&gt; &gt; This is my first time posting o=\r\nn the vedic-wisdom group.
