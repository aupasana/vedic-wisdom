Most of us assume that this is only applicable in m=\r\nundane\n&gt; matters. This is applicable in the path of spirituality too. I kno=\r\nw\n&gt; there are people who think that any affair/process related to God \nmust=\r\n\n&gt; be done perfectly. Honestly ... unless one is an adept, this is\n&gt; imposs=\r\nible and only repeated and sincere attempts makes one an \nadept.\n&gt; \n&gt; Remin=\r\nds me of the great Kalidasa who worshipped Goddess Mahakali \nfor\n&gt; nine liv=\r\nes and he was born a dunce in his tenth and she appeared to\n&gt; him in his 10=\r\nth lifetime, when his sadhana was complete and he \nbanged\n&gt; his head out of=\r\n sheer frustration. Imagine!!! In Kaliyuga, along \nwith\n&gt; Homa, surrenderin=\r\ng to ones chosen deity is the best path for most. \n&gt; \n&gt; Let me share one in=\r\ncident, when Narasimha&#39;s spiritual Guru whom I \nalso\n&gt; consider my Guru, as=\r\nked me (when we were in Chennai for Shata \nChandi\n&gt; Homa) to learn Mahagana=\r\npthi homam, I thought he was really joking!\n&gt; When I got back to the US, he=\r\n called me again and reminded me. It \nthen\n&gt; occured to me he was really be=\r\ning serious. So, I started searching \non\n&gt; the net and I found a really fli=\r\nmsy document, but nevertheless I \ntook\n&gt; it up and performed it. But, I was=\r\n not satisfied.  Manishji then\n&gt; reminded me of the book he gifted me, but =\r\neven in that it was \nentirely\n&gt; in Samskrit and illiterate that I am, I cou=\r\nldn&#39;t distinguish \nbetween\n&gt; an instruction and sloka :). Around this time,=\r\n Narasimha \noccasionally\n&gt; performed a longer version of the homam and I pa=\r\nrticpated in it, \nbut\n&gt; never could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to gui=\r\nde me, which he\n&gt; did, but still it did not get through my really dense bra=\r\nins :). I\n&gt; felt really helpless, but the stars were such that I never gave=\r\n up,\n&gt; instead I made a sincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that If he really\n&gt;=\r\n intends that I perform the homa, then he should kindly show me the\n&gt; way. =\r\nIn around two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has \ndecided\n&gt; to docum=\r\nent the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just couldnt\n&gt; believe my luc=\r\nk and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent for his\n&gt; grace. Well ... its =\r\nbeen exactly 2yrs and I am still at it taking\n&gt; baby-steps and making progr=\r\ness everyday.\n&gt; \n&gt; I thank Manishji, Narasimha and the all the divine force=\r\ns for \nhelping\n&gt; me progress.\n&gt; \n&gt; My request, pls dont give it up, persist=\r\n with it no matter what. We\n&gt; are humans and prone to mistakes. But then no=\r\nbody got perfect the \nvery\n&gt; first time, unless he has worked on it a lot i=\r\nn his previous lives.\n&gt; Its all a continuum. Dont worry about time, we have=\r\n future \nlives ...\n&gt; plenty of time. These things take their own sweet time=\r\n, doesnt \nhappen\n&gt; overnight. No matter what, complete your homa everyday, =\r\nthat \nshould be\n&gt; the primary goal ... nothing else. Pls dont waver from it=\r\n, whether \nyou\n&gt; get or dont get anything. Slowly we&#39;ll progress in our Sad=\r\nhana and\n&gt; move on to higher things. I wish all the best. We should really =\r\n\nthank\n&gt; our stars that people like Manishji and Narasimhaji are here \nguid=\r\ning\n&gt; us ... what would be life without them!\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks for listening.\n&gt; =\r\nRegards\n&gt; -Narayan-\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal =\r\npathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Garu !!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;A serva=\r\nnt carrying a million dollar check to the bank and \ncashing it \n&gt; &gt; &gt;is NOT=\r\n superior to a servant carrying a $100 check to the bank \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt;cashing=\r\n it.

Let me give an analogy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your favorite deity as the master and yourself as a \n&gt; &gt; ser=\r\nvant. A servant simply serves the master. Similarly, all the \n&gt; &gt; sadhana y=\r\nou do and your other activities are your way to serve \nyour \n&gt; &gt; master.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have many big checks \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to mail \nothers. \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers to the \nbank and \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in \nthis \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n world and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s agenda in \nthis \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; world. That is why various gods (including Vishnu himself) and \n&gt; &gt; vario=\r\nus rishis keep coming back to earth every now and then. The \n&gt; &gt; supreme go=\r\nd of this world operates through various physical \npersons \n&gt; &gt; present on =\r\nearth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and other spiritual sadhana, purify oursel=\r\nves and \ntry \n&gt; &gt; to help others, because that is god&#39;s work. Just as a ser=\r\nvant \ncarries \n&gt; &gt; master&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for god.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded by others as good work tends to \npromot=\r\ne ego \n&gt; &gt; and we need to guard against it. A servant carrying a million \nd=\r\nollar \n&gt; &gt; check to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; carrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are \nmerely \n&gt; &gt; =\r\ndoing their master&#39;s work and do not own anything. Both are just \n&gt; &gt; *inst=\r\nruments* used by the master to carry out his agenda. \nSimilarly, \n&gt; &gt; one w=\r\nho does what are considered great deeds in this world and \none \n&gt; &gt; who doe=\r\ns what are considered meagre deeds in this world are both \n&gt; &gt; servants of =\r\ngod helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in this world. \n&gt; &gt; Neither really own=\r\ns anything. One may consider oneself superior \nto \n&gt; &gt; the other because hi=\r\ns/her deeds are considered superior by the \nworld, \n&gt; &gt; but he/she is just =\r\nas foolish as a servant who considers \n&gt; &gt; himself/herself superior to anot=\r\nher servant carrying something \nless \n&gt; &gt; valuable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If this a=\r\nttitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates \none&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; attitude, th=\r\ninking and instincts, one is safe no matter what \n&gt; &gt; situations his previo=\r\nus karmas place one in. One can remain \nhappy and \n&gt; &gt; blissful in pleasure=\r\n and pain, in praise and criticism and in \nlight \n&gt; &gt; and darkness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It is \na job=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; you are doing for god. You do the best you can. But you own \nnothing.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; You are doing it for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------\n---\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish softw=\r\nare (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (S=\r\nJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n--- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   ----- Original Mess=\r\nage ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Sent: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Subject:=\r\n Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Dear=\r\n Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Reading your response another question ca=\r\nme into my \nmind. \n&gt; &gt; You said:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;          It is not good if fi=\r\nre is extinguished by rain in the \n&gt; &gt; middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;     =\r\n    Is it not good that the fire gets extinguished by \nrain, or \n&gt; &gt; the fa=\r\nct that the fire is getting extinguished?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         I mean actyu=\r\nally i feel when someone starts doing homa \n&gt; &gt; regularly, there can be ins=\r\ntances when the homa agni gets \n&gt; &gt; extinguished while the homa is still on=\r\n..happened with me couple \nof \n&gt; &gt; times... i seriously dont knbow what to =\r\nmake of it but as one \nmember \n&gt; &gt; in this list had suggested to me,  i rel=\r\night the fire and keep \n&gt; &gt; continuing with the homa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         =\r\n-Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;          \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n         The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva \nSutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         --- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Subject=\r\n: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati \nHomam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           To: ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt;itsverys=\r\nimple@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Date: Thursday, 4 December, 2008, 6:48 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Namaste Phani,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 1)Can Homam be=\r\n performed on the roof top of a house\n(3-\n&gt; &gt; floors) ? Can a homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n         &gt; kundam made by arranging red bricks, with sand \nbase be \n&gt; &gt; use=\r\nd instead of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; copper one?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Yes, yo=\r\nu can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the \nopen is \n&gt; &gt; actually better tha=\r\nn doing it in closed space. But realize that \na \n&gt; &gt; rain can cause problem=\r\ns. Keep an umbrella around to protect the \nfire \n&gt; &gt; if it rains while you =\r\nare doing homam. It is not good if fire is \n&gt; &gt; extinguished by rain in the=\r\n middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Yes, you can construct a homa ku=\r\nndam with bricks and \nsand \n&gt; &gt; at the bottom. Use a square shaped huma kun=\r\nda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 aud=\r\nio \nfile, \n&gt; &gt; should one repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; mantras mentally alo=\r\nng with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           One can repeat mentally while lis=\r\ntening attentively \n(not \n&gt; &gt; casually). Actually, even listening to mantra=\r\ns with all the \nattention \n&gt; &gt; focused is as powerful as saying mantras.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and thinking \nof=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is listening \nto it=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; with focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. Then the \nmantra=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from \nthe \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. One \ncan \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected. The key is \n&gt; &gt; con=\r\ntrol over the mind and keeping the mind focused on the mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n           However, there is a difference between meditation \nand \n&gt; &gt; homa=\r\nm. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation \nand it \n&gt; &gt; is s=\r\nubmitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So making \nsome \n&gt; &gt; exte=\r\nrnal sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as opposed to \nsilent \n&gt; &gt; chant=\r\ning or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 3)Can=\r\n bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other \n&gt; &gt; conditions/niyamas that\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;           &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeterain \nfood?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread \nceremony)=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is irrelevant.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them \n&gt; &gt; strictl=\r\ny. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food on \nthe \n&gt; &gt; day of =\r\nhomam and take a bath before homam. Another rule I will \n&gt; &gt; recommend is t=\r\no avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           =\r\nBy the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to \ndo \n&gt; &gt; homam for spir=\r\nitual progress, I am willing to take \nresponsibility and \n&gt; &gt; allow them to=\r\n do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru as \nguru \n&gt; &gt; and perform =\r\nhomam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred in \nthe \n&gt; &gt; process unti=\r\nl the person crosses some minimum threshhold of \npurity \n&gt; &gt; through homam =\r\nand other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or no \n&gt; &gt; sacred thread, mant=\r\nropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not \nmatter \n&gt; &gt; after a while, when t=\r\nhe person crosses a threshhold of purity. \nThe \n&gt; &gt; goal of upanayanam and =\r\nother mantropadesa by guru is to speed \nthis up \n&gt; &gt; and make the person cr=\r\noss the threshhold of purity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           As long as one desires=\r\n no specific material benefits \n(and \n&gt; &gt; ready to receive whatever god giv=\r\nes) and does homam for \nspiritual \n&gt; &gt; progress, I am willing to help, even=\r\n if it means some suffering \nfor \n&gt; &gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; 4)Any go=\r\nod date to start the Homam? or any day \nwould be \n&gt; &gt; fine?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   =\r\n        For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi \nmorning. \n&gt; &gt; But=\r\n any day is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         =\r\n  Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my \nIndia \n&gt; &gt; trip.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru \nManish=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; traveled together to several places (on a specific project). We \nende=\r\nd \n&gt; &gt; up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we \nwere).=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. \nAs \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not take it \n&gt; &gt; serious=\r\nly. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to the \n&gt; &gt; rooftop of t=\r\nhe apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. \nManish \n&gt; &gt; told me, &quot;Nara=\r\nsimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city \nafter \n&gt; &gt; our homam finis=\r\nhes&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           To my surprise, it did rain as =\r\nsoon as our homas \n&gt; &gt; finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it suddenly =\r\nstarted \nraining \n&gt; &gt; with really big drops. Luckily, there was a small tow=\r\nel/blanket \non \n&gt; &gt; the rooftop close to us. Together, we held it on top of=\r\n the two \nsmall \n&gt; &gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditated. We held th=\r\ne cloth \ncover \n&gt; &gt; on the homa kundas until fire in the two homa kundas we=\r\nnt off \nand \n&gt; &gt; then packed everything and went down. We left for Kurukshe=\r\ntra \nlater \n&gt; &gt; that day, but we were told that a heavy rain continued for =\r\na few \ndays \n&gt; &gt; in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed us on that trip as we=\r\n \ncovered \n&gt; &gt; the north, east and west of India. It rained in every place =\r\nwe \nwent \n&gt; &gt; to, as we finished our task in that place and prepared to mov=\r\ne \non.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n           ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------\n -----\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nrologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Spirituality: http://grou=\r\nps. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \n&gt; &gt; wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Free Jyotish lesson=\r\ns (MP3): http://vedicastro. \n&gt; &gt; home..comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Free Jy=\r\notish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;       =\r\n    Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: \nhttp://www.SriJagan \n&gt; &gt; nath..org=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------\n ----=\r\n-\n&gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           ---- Phanikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@ =\r\ngmail.com&gt; \nwrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   =\r\n        &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam \ndaily, and \n&gt; &gt; hav=\r\ne few questions\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; regarding it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   =\r\n        &gt; 1)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house\n(3-\n&gt; &gt; floor=\r\ns) ?
