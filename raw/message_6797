A yogi who considers each sensory experience as an \n=\r\n&gt; aahuti (oblation) to the agni (fire) of indwelling Self, does not get \n&gt; =\r\nattached to sensory experiences and remains free from attraction and \n&gt; ave=\r\nrsion for them. Whatever one sees (physically or within the mind!), \n&gt; what=\r\never one hears (physically or within the mind), whatever touch one \n&gt; feels=\r\n etc, one considers it a sacred offering to the fire of indwelling \n&gt; Self.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, whatever action one performs, one considers it as an offer=\r\ning \n&gt; to the fire of all-pervading Self and remains free from the sense of=\r\n \n&gt; doership.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is the real internal homam performed by a liberated=\r\n yogi. This is \n&gt; the goal of sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, most of us are not abl=\r\ne to avoid attraction/aversion for \n&gt; various sensory experiences and the s=\r\nense of doership over actions. One \n&gt; needs to purify one&#39;s consciousness t=\r\no free oneself and prepare for this \n&gt; internal homam. One can perform an e=\r\nxternal homam to purify and prepare \n&gt; oneself.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; When one feels attraction or aversion for something one perceives \n&gt; phy=\r\nsically or mentally, one can try to take a steo back and consider the \n&gt; pe=\r\nrception itself to be an offering to the fire of Self or Brahman \n&gt; burning=\r\n brightly inside one (and outside too). When feels pride or shame \n&gt; for an=\r\n action one performed, one can try to take a step back and \n&gt; consider the =\r\naction to be an offering to the fire of Self or Brahman \n&gt; burning brightly=\r\n everywhere. Even a non-liberated person can try to \n&gt; alter one&#39;s thinking=\r\n slowly, with practice.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Softwar=\r\ne, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manual=\r\ns for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.o=\r\nrg\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jy=\r\notish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;            =\r\n           Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; ----------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
