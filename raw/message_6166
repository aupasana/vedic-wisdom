It is indeed one=\r\n of the cornerstones of Sanskrit that a consonant cannot exist by itself an=\r\nd its life is given by the Vowel. But for whatever reason in Hindi they mos=\r\ntly avoid ending vowels. They carry that habit to other languages as well a=\r\nnd recently I heard one of the North Indian bhajan singers (I don&#39;t know th=\r\ne name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bhaja Govindam as &quot;Bhaj govindam, bhaj govind=\r\nam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, which sounded quite odd to me! And they tak=\r\ne that approach to languages like Braj Bhasha and Avadhi as well. For insta=\r\nnce, for them &quot;Ramacharita Manasa&quot; is more important than even Valmiki&#39;s Ra=\r\nmayana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also without proper vowel endings. Howeve=\r\nr, I have a strong feeling that, that approach is incorrect. In avadhi, a c=\r\nhowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana\n&gt; &gt;  Saroja\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; raja&quot; should be pronounced=\r\n exactly like that and not like &quot;Sri Gurucharan saroj raj&quot;.

It is the nature of Kali yuga to corrupt everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my feeling that many people, including highly learned Vedi=\r\nc scholars, pronounce some sounds in Sanskrit mantras (including Veda mantr=\r\nas) incorrectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, pronunciation is not every=\r\nthing. Having devotion and the spirit of surrender to god is even more impo=\r\nrtant. However, pronunciation is a factor too. Especially, correct pronunci=\r\nation is very important in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mant=\r\nra can stop one from the most complete experience of the mantra. In fact, w=\r\ne have a lot of people who can memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very f=\r\new who can actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the ne=\r\nxt few months, I will write my views on correct pronunciation and point out=\r\n some common errors. If you do not think that correct pronunciation is impo=\r\nrtant or if you disagree with my assessment of the errors or if you do not =\r\nwant to change your pronunciation, please ignore my writings on this subjec=\r\nt. On the other hand, if you are open to changing your pronunciation, pleas=\r\ne give a consideration to my views and adopt my suggestions if you find the=\r\nm appropriate.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take the &quot;t&quot;=\r\n sound at the end of the words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sahas=\r\nrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound incorrectly. Th=\r\ney change &quot;t&quot; to something like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is a =\r\nreason why this corruption came into practice, but it is a corruption never=\r\ntheless.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one le=\r\ntter/syllable/akshara. If you change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding =\r\na vowel sound at the end, it becomes two aksharas. This increases the numbe=\r\nr of aksharas, changes the chhandas and changes the meaning also. You may s=\r\ntill experience something when meditating on the mantra, but you will never=\r\n experience the mantra to the fullest with that pronunciation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Akshara means &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life f=\r\norce) of an akshara. If you have just a consonant without a vowel after it,=\r\n then it has no praana. It is kshara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For e=\r\nxample, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (without adding any sounds to it), you c=\r\nannot sustain the sound and the listener cannot decipher what exactly you p=\r\nronounced. It has no life force.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, th=\r\ne whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Because &quot;t&quot; has no praana by itself, i=\r\nt simply joins to the akshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana=\r\n) and becomes part of that akshara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one l=\r\netter (one guru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is difficult for =\r\nthe listener to know for sure whether you said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. =\r\nIt is possible if one listens carefully, but otherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; a=\r\nt the end is a very quick and abrupt transient sound without praana. So it =\r\ntough to hear clearly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This makes people add some vowe=\r\nl to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in between=\r\n them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a praana and becomes clearly audible. It =\r\nsuddenly becomes an akshara and the chhandas changes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nProbably, some big teacher started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t=\r\n&quot; gets a praana of itself and becomes very clear to hear, so that his stude=\r\nnts would not get confused when learning. Probably the students thought the=\r\n mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used to that mis-pronunciat=\r\nion. Probably, that became a standard practice after a couple of centuries.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not =\r\nchange it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant a=\r\nnd leave it there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be added at the end. T=\r\nhe same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I said about words ending in consonants applies to=\r\n all consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly encountered. =\r\nThere can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also, people norm=\r\nally add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end up changing the chhan=\r\ndas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. That is also wrong.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One more common mistake is the =\r\nsound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce this a=\r\ns &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbo=\r\nls of tha and dha looks very similar and just one dot in the middle is diff=\r\nerent. It is possible that some people started mispronouncing this sound be=\r\ncause of their inability to see the dot and others started following. Now p=\r\nronouncing tha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing correctly will =\r\nbe the odd person out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is not English. We nev=\r\ner have two different symbols for the same sound or two different sounds fo=\r\nr the same symbol. The letters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different and their soun=\r\nds are different too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D =\r\ncopper) with a stress/aspiration to get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the sankalpa before many poojas, people say &quot;dharmaar=\r\ntha kaama moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for at=\r\ntaining the purusharthas (purposes of human existence) - dharma (fulfilling=\r\n duties), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (de=\r\nveloping detachment)&quot;. Most people end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama mo=\r\nksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and mo=\r\nksha&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means =\r\n&quot;half a human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I h=\r\nave seen it committed by many many trained priests!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wh=\r\nen you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to the diffe=\r\nrence between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them differently. When=\r\n you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay extra attention to ensure that y=\r\nou are not confusing tha for dha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by most =\r\npeople in the pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I will be pointing them ou=\r\nt slowly in the next few months, whenever the Mother allows me to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please give me your consideration and take my input into consi=\r\nderation in altering your pronunciation (if you are open to that). If you d=\r\non&#39;t find any sense in what I am saying or want to continue as taught by yo=\r\nur gurus, I can understand that. I am not here to change everybody&#39;s pronun=\r\nciation. But, because She inspired me to share my thoughts with the world, =\r\nI am guessing that there are SOME who are destined to change their pronunci=\r\nation based on my views. That is why I am writing these mails.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you do not like this discussion, I am sorry and just ignore thi=\r\ns idiot!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Gana=\r\npathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirit=\r\nuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish l=\r\nessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Cen=\r\ntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
