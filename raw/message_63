A priest may have gotten used to the=\r\n fast style because of others and not due to lack of devotion. Fast reading=\r\n of mantras does not prove a lack of devotion (though it sometimes indicate=\r\ns that). A priest may pronounce mantras incorrectly or very fast, but may h=\r\nave the highest level of devotion in his heart. If such a priest calls gods=\r\n, they WILL come. Gods do not do nitpicking about your pronunciation or pro=\r\ncedure or speed, when your devotion and effort makes them happy. Shiva was =\r\npleased with the meat offering Kannappa who did not know how to worship!\n \n=\r\nWhen scriptures refer to Sabda Brahman, the &quot;sabda&quot; (vibration) referred to=\r\n there is not just the physical audible sound. When we say a mantra, the th=\r\noughts, the images and the movement of praana in the mind also accompany th=\r\ne sound as subtler levels of sabda. Out of the 4 levels of sabda (vaikhari,=\r\n madhyama, pasyanti and para), the audible sound that results in vibration =\r\nof the gross matter around us is only the grossest level (vaikhari). The ot=\r\nher levels cause vibration in the subtle matter around us. An advanced yogi=\r\n may be able to hear (not with ears) those vibrations too. Those vibrations=\r\n are a more important part of the sabda.\n \nEven a person who reads a mantra=\r\n perfectly may produce wrong sabda if his thoughts are wandering. One who p=\r\nronounces incorrectly but has his mind firmly focussed on the Lord produces=\r\n an almost perfect sabda and reaches Him.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThough I =\r\nurge people to make an effort - as stated in the previous mail - to pronoun=\r\nce mantras slower and better, I urge them NOT to judge others around them. =\r\nIt is dangerous. Judge yourself and not others.\n \nIf you can do a pooja you=\r\nrself, it is always a good idea to do that.\n \nBut, when you call a priest t=\r\no your house to perform a pooja, don&#39;t judge him and just think of him as S=\r\nhiva. Think that Shiva Himself came to your house and doing that pooja. Bel=\r\nieve that in all sincerity and surrender. Then, you will get the perfect fr=\r\nuits of the pooja, no matter how the priest reads the mantras, no matter ho=\r\nw much he hurries and no matter how much his devotion is! All that is HIS k=\r\narma. If you truly accept him as Shiva and take his deeds as Shiva&#39;s deeds,=\r\n your karma is pure.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt;   Unfortunately, we are not =\r\nliving in the best of times and\n&gt; possibility times are going to get even w=\r\norse.\n \nThere is a silver lining to every cloud.\n \nCompared to Krita/Sathya=\r\n yuga, the overall dharma in this Kali yuga is 1/4th. However, the dharma f=\r\nollowed by an average person today is probably 1/100th or 1/1000th of the d=\r\nharma followed by an average person in Krita yuga. How is it then that the =\r\naverage dharma is 1/4th?\n \nObviously, there are some souls somewhere, who a=\r\nre engaged in great tapascharya and pulling up the average dharma for the b=\r\nenefit of the world. Thus, even though we &quot;are not living in the best of ti=\r\nmes&quot;, there are places and people where &quot;the best of times&quot; is maintained. =\r\nIf it gets &quot;even worse&quot;, the sections that are maintaining dharma will get =\r\neven better. SHE ensures that. One can volunteer for that work and seek Her=\r\n blessings.\n \nEach fall is a new opportunity to rise. Each falling soul is =\r\na new opportunity for you to serve.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ve=\r\ndicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.=\r\norg\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n \n&gt; Si=\r\nr,\n&gt;    \n&gt;   You have noted well. Such problem does not exists with a small=\r\n group of brahmins but actually with a majority of them these days. I live =\r\nin Canada and at times, I hasve inquired with priest for different pujas th=\r\nat I want to do at home....each time the pundit says it is going to take  1=\r\n 1/2 hours....no matter what type of puja it is , it is going to take 1 1/2=\r\n hours. Hence I have decided, I am not going to call any brahmin at home to=\r\n do puja.....just do whatever I can to the best of my ability.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Un=\r\nfortunately, we are not living in the best of times and possibility times a=\r\nre going to get even worse.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Regards,\n&gt;   Bhupendra.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Narasim=\r\nha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;             Namaste revered friends and e=\r\nlders,\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I was at a Srisukta homam at a local temple a few weeks ba=\r\nck. The priests recited Sri Suktam 16 times. But, unfortunately, they read =\r\nit too fast. After finishing 15 times very fast, they read the last time sl=\r\nowly. It is as if they are thinking &quot;thank God it is over, now I don&#39;t need=\r\n to hurry anymore. Let me do it slowly, now that only one count is left&quot;. T=\r\nhis is unfortunate.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   If you have decided to express your love to y=\r\nour parents, will you say it with a hurried tone and a business attitude? O=\r\nr, will you say it slowly and clearly with love, care and expression? Worsh=\r\nipping a deity is also like expressing your love to your father/mother!\n&gt;  =\r\n  \n&gt;   Especially, Vedic chants have a special power. When chanted with the=\r\n correct pronunciation and intonation, they have the power to transform. Bu=\r\nt one cannot hurry them. If one hurries a Vedic chant, certain sounds will =\r\nnot be clearly audible. The intonation - ups and downs - on various akshara=\r\ns get mixed up. It is not possible to put the correct intonation on each ak=\r\nshara (and for the entire duration of the akshara) if one hurries. Some int=\r\nonation levels sometimes get carried over wrongly from one akshara to anoth=\r\ner. That is not good. There is no comparison between the energy and bliss p=\r\nroduced by a perfect Vedic chanting and an erroneous one under haste. Vedic=\r\n chants are not meant to be read too fast. Those who cling on to fixed coun=\r\nts and sacrifice the quality of chanting are missing the main point and los=\r\ning the actual benefit.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   If one has limited time to perform a ritu=\r\nal, it is better to reduce the counts instead of keeping long counts and hu=\r\nrrying the chanting. It is better to read 11 times slowly and clearly, rath=\r\ner than reading 16 times hastily. I wonder if it is better to just decide a=\r\n time period and chant for the duration with a normal speed (without bother=\r\ning about counts), rather than having a target count. The latter has the po=\r\ntential to create hurry.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I am not finding fault with any specific=\r\n person or group here, but just airing a general complaint I have with a sm=\r\nall section of the priest community. If a single person&#39;s thinking is affec=\r\nted by this mail, my purpose is served!\n&gt;    \n&gt;   I am sorry if I offended =\r\nanybody.\n&gt;    \n&gt;   Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.ho=\r\nme.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------------\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0242_01C7AFF6.1B5E50D0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.6000.16481&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYL=\r\nE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namast=\r\ne Sir,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;There is another angle.

The latter has the potential to create \nhurry.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am not finding fault \nwith any sp=\r\necific person or group here, but just airing a general complaint I \nhave wi=\r\nth a small section of the priest community. If a single person&#39;s thinking \n=\r\nis affected by this mail, my purpose is served!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; I am sorry if I offended anybody.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Homam \nm=\r\nanual and audio: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A \nh=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.n=\r\net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nFree Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nSri Jagannath=\r\n Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot;&gt;http://www.=\r\nSriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n---------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0242_01C7AFF6.1B5E50D0--\r\n\n"}}
