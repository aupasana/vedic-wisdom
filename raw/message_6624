However, in my case I consider Sri Hanuman to be the for=\r\nm of the Divine that I am most devoted to.  Right now in my life I am in Ve=\r\nnus dasha and I have a lot of &#39;Venus type&#39; problems (btw my Venus is &#39;combu=\r\nst&#39; and only at 0 degrees in Aq.)  I feel as if I continue to worship Sri H=\r\nanuman (Mars?) and not do mantra for Shukra it would be like directing too =\r\nmuch energy to one place and not enough energy where it is needed.\n\nAm I mi=\r\nssing the point?\n\nD Raj\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR=\r\n Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; To come to the astrologic=\r\nal point, do you recall if this person was\n&gt; &gt; going through a period or ot=\r\nher influence which could have &#39;sparked&#39; \n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; &gt; associated with such &#39;=\r\ninner help&#39;\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, some times are more conducive to actually accep=\r\nting the inner \n&gt; guidance and taking the right path and some times are les=\r\ns conducive. \n&gt; Planets do have some control. But, my point is that astrolo=\r\ngy as we know \n&gt; is unreliable and one is better off just surrendering to g=\r\nod. There is \n&gt; something called free will and it can be used to surrender =\r\nto god and \n&gt; pray sincerely.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Reminds me of a=\r\nn incident. A gentleman had a high flying career during \n&gt; dot com bubble, =\r\nbut was struggling for a few years. He was from a \n&gt; distinguished lineage =\r\nof learned brahmins. I saw the horoscope and \n&gt; suggested Lakshmi homam eve=\r\nryday with Sri Sooktam 16 times with only \n&gt; ghee as the aahuti. I said the=\r\n remedy will help a lot, but the next 2 \n&gt; years were very problematic and =\r\nI wasn&#39;t sure how much progress could be \n&gt; made. But I said things would b=\r\ne better after 2 years. I told him to try \n&gt; it nevertheless.\n&gt; \n&gt; He mispl=\r\naced the paper on which he wrote all this down and forgot about \n&gt; this com=\r\npletely. He continued to struggle for 2 years. About 26 months \n&gt; later, hi=\r\ns wife was cleaning the house and found this paper. She gave it \n&gt; to him. =\r\nHe suddenly got inspired and started homam. Within a month, he \n&gt; got a job=\r\n and his wife too got a job without really trying.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the end, one&#39;s w=\r\nell-being is in one&#39;s hands. Others can try to \n&gt; motivate, but nothing hap=\r\npens without the internal trigger. Moreover, \n&gt; doing a remedy with a reaso=\r\nnable attitude takes some preparation and \n&gt; maturing (in the case below, t=\r\nhis person was reasonably mature to start \n&gt; with and reading vedic-wisdom =\r\nmessages added to it). Force does not work \n&gt; in these matters. Make things=\r\n available, put out some inspirational \n&gt; material and leave it to the pers=\r\non.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I know you are a very busy professional=\r\n and perhaps have your own\n&gt; &gt; spiritual path and activities to follow\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Yes, I am busy professional in high tech and have my own spiritual \n&gt; sadh=\r\nana too. But this karma - sharings in Jyotish and spirituality - is \n&gt; a *p=\r\nart* of my spiritual sadhana. It is my offering to Lord. One must \n&gt; share =\r\nwith the world the good things one has access to.\n&gt; \n&gt; I was touched when I=\r\n heard about an old priest. Someone from Vizag took \n&gt; a copy of our Mahaga=\r\nnapathi homam manual when they visited Boston and \n&gt; gave it to a local pri=\r\nest who is around 75 years old. He apparently \n&gt; liked it, made 200 copies,=\r\n distributed at a Vizag temple and told people \n&gt; to do homam themselves us=\r\ning the manual. This is a priest whose \n&gt; livelihood can be affected if peo=\r\nple do homam by themselves. Yet, he was \n&gt; unselfish and realized the power=\r\n of enabling people on a mass scale and \n&gt; what it can do to individuals an=\r\nd to society in general.\n&gt; \n&gt; Those who like the free resources should feel=\r\n free to spread the word. \n&gt; But do NOT expect anything in return - praise =\r\nor acknowledgment. Do not \n&gt; even expect that the person listens and starts=\r\n doing homam. Be prepared \n&gt; for the effort to go waste and yet put in the =\r\nbest effort. Act like the \n&gt; most passionate person, but be prepared for an=\r\ny result of the action - \n&gt; favorable or unfavorable! THAT is detached acti=\r\non or nishkama karma.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;ll club the reply to =\r\none more mail:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Congrats. He could be lucky but one must not forget t=\r\nhat all prayers \n&gt; &gt; are not always answered.\n&gt; \n&gt; All sincere and humble p=\r\nrayers are of course always answered. \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, &quot;you=\r\n go one step towards god and god will \n&gt; come 3 steps towards you&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\ne only tricky thing is that it may take some time - god waits till the \n&gt; p=\r\nerson first becomes worthy of being given something. Surrender and keep \n&gt; =\r\ndoing the remedy with *faith*. Faith, humility and surrender are the \n&gt; key=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; Also, sometimes god may not give what you asked for, but what he gi=\r\nves \n&gt; is always better for you. Bottomline is this: If you have a problem,=\r\n \n&gt; take it up with god. Do it with faith, humility and surrender. Fire can=\r\n \n&gt; be a very effective medium to god.

He calls it a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;miracle&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He sent me several mai=\r\nls earlier asking for an astrological advice. \n&gt; &gt;&gt; It\n&gt; &gt;&gt; did not feel li=\r\nke there was anything I could do and I ignored. He\n&gt; &gt;&gt; discovered the free=\r\n homam manuals and the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; derived inspiration fr=\r\nom the mails there and used the free resources\n&gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the homam websit=\r\ne.

Exactly how much effort is needed\n&gt; &gt;&gt; depends on the=\r\n individual case and the karmas involved. But, things\n&gt; &gt; like\n&gt; &gt;&gt; homam a=\r\nnd intense meditation can only help. God either solves one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt;&gt; problems =\r\nor creates a situation where one rises above the problems,\n&gt; &gt; i.e.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; do=\r\nes not get affected by the problems.

Sadly, I or any astrologer cannot solve their problems.=\r\n Solving\n&gt; &gt;&gt; their problems is in their own hands!! Irrespective of the ex=\r\nact\n&gt; &gt; nature\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of blocking karmas, doing homam or intense meditation c=\r\nan only \n&gt; &gt;&gt; benefit\n&gt; &gt;&gt; one. Though people may think that they need an a=\r\nstrologer to tell \n&gt; &gt;&gt; them\n&gt; &gt;&gt; which deity to worship and otherwise bad =\r\nthings can happen, this is \n&gt; &gt;&gt; an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; unfounded fear.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have s=\r\ntudied and experimented with astrology (still do) as well as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; anybody a=\r\nlive today. I can declare with utmost confidence that our\n&gt; &gt;&gt; understandin=\r\ng is half-baked at best and one cannot rely on astrology\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; life-=\r\nchanging decisions. On the other hand, one can rely on god. Gods\n&gt; &gt;&gt; like =\r\nGanesha, Kartikeya, Vishnu, Krishna, Lakshmi, Shiva, Hanuman,\n&gt; &gt; Durga\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; etc can give any material or spiritual results, including moksha.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Wo=\r\nrshipping any of them is perfectly safe. Each deity puts a\n&gt; &gt; surrendered\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; devotee on the correct path, in one&#39;s own way. Each of them is far\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; better than me or any astrologer alive today, for changing your life\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nfor\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the better! Picking a deity based on taste and doing homam or inte=\r\nnse\n&gt; &gt;&gt; meditation is faaaaaaar better than approaching astrologers like m=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; astrological advice.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If you are un=\r\nsure which deity to worship, worship Ganesha with\n&gt; &gt; Ganapathi\n&gt; &gt;&gt; homam.=\r\n It is a superb sadhana to set one&#39;s life on the correct path,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; both ma=\r\nterially and spiritually. You don&#39;t have to take my word for\n&gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; T=\r\nhe proof of the pudding is in eating it. Try it yourself for a few\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mon=\r\nths and see what happens. Your main problem will either be solved\n&gt; &gt; or\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; your mental state will start to change so that the problem&#39;s impact \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; you is reduced. You yourself will see how you are benefiting!\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Also, there are many insightful and inspiring mails on spiritual\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n sadhana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; on vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, which have inspired many people t=\r\no do\n&gt; &gt; homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and other sadhanas.

But, even otherwise=\r\n, consider sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; A\n&gt; &gt;&gt; homam can be done in just 20-30 minutes. Spe=\r\nnding 20-30 min\n&gt; &gt; worshipping\n&gt; &gt;&gt; god in fire everyday can change your l=\r\nife for the better and \n&gt; &gt;&gt; transform\n&gt; &gt;&gt; your personality completely.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; In fact, it is Mother&#39;s wish that several people should regularly\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; worship various deities in fire again and progress. World is going to\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; transformed drastically in the coming decades, at many levels.

Yes, I started\n&gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; homams =\r\nand japams by following guidelines from your homam website and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; from yo=\r\nur emails on Vedic-wisdom list and a real life miracle \n&gt; &gt;&gt; happened\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nfor me. Narsimhaji I bow in front of you. I feel we, whoever, know\n&gt; &gt; you,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; are so fortunate that we got a Guru like you in this world. You are a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Modern Age Guru who is enlightening us, showing us direction with all=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the vedic knowledge you got. I had known you for your Astrology \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; but not that much for Vedic knowledge and wisdom. But now I kn=\r\now that\n&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; this facebook and iphone era we have a Guru who can sha=\r\nre Vedas\n&gt; &gt;&gt; knowledge with us and show us right path in this life sitting=\r\n here in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the US.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ... This dates back to last year when my wife fo=\r\nund your website over\n&gt; &gt;&gt; the internet and came to me saying she found a v=\r\nery easy way of doing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; homam by ourselves. She always thought that for =\r\nall our day to day\n&gt; &gt;&gt; problems that we were facing in our life, we should=\r\n perform some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; homam/pooja, but we didn=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t know h=\r\now to do that. So when I\n&gt; &gt; looked at the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; link she sent to me I told =\r\nthe gentleman who had written this was our\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narsimha guru, and If he wa=\r\ns recommending to do homams and written\n&gt; &gt;&gt; something for it, then we shou=\r\nld go for it, and for the first time we\n&gt; &gt;&gt; did homam at our home during n=\r\navratri 2010.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; As you know I was searching for full time job for last 2=\r\n yrs, and had\n&gt; &gt;&gt; failed 17-18 interviews thus far- I think I had sent you=\r\n emails a\n&gt; &gt; couple\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of times seeking some remedies- but you were busy=\r\n. In 6 or 7 such\n&gt; &gt;&gt; interviews I reached close enough to think that I was=\r\n going to get an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; offer letter but never got any. ...\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I started se=\r\narching Vedic astrology mailing list ... I found one of\n&gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt;&gt; posti=\r\nngs where you had written about hanuman chalisa and then given a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; link =\r\nfor vedic-wisdom list. I started looking at that list and read\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about y=\r\nour experience with Manish Pandit, that made me read me many \n&gt; &gt;&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nyour postings on that list. ... why couldn=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t I do in=\r\ntense pooja\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; homams and nullify that effect. I read your commen=\r\nt to surrender to\n&gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; god and worship him same time everyday with =\r\nfull surrender and do\n&gt; &gt;&gt; homams. I discussed this with my wife and we dec=\r\nided to take the \n&gt; &gt;&gt; route\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of homam and japams. We performed one hom=\r\nam and I started chanting\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hanuman Chalisa everyday with full devotion,=\r\n attention and Surrender.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ...\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I started doing daily Hanuman Chali=\r\nsa. Everyday I do Hanuman Chalisa\n&gt; &gt; 5/7\n&gt; &gt;&gt; times daily, and before star=\r\nting I think about you, Manish Pandit and\n&gt; &gt; Pt\n&gt; &gt;&gt; XX=C3=A2=E2=82=AC&quot;all=\r\n three as my gurus. I start my japam by telling god that\n&gt; &gt; if I am\n&gt; &gt;&gt; h=\r\nonest and sincere, haven=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t committed anything wrong,=\r\n then god\n&gt; &gt; should\n&gt; &gt;&gt; come and l help me out. To my surprise just withi=\r\nn 15 days, I got 2\n&gt; &gt;&gt; interview calls. I went and attended interviews. Th=\r\ne Interviews went\n&gt; &gt;&gt; well as always, but this time I got the JOB OFFERs. =\r\nYeah, job offers\n&gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; 2 places. It ended my 2 years of struggle, I c=\r\nouldn=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t believe\n&gt; &gt; it. I am\n&gt; &gt;&gt; planning to join o=\r\nne of them next Monday 20 th June. Hence this time\n&gt; &gt; it\n&gt; &gt;&gt; was not your=\r\n Astrology wisdom, it is your vedic wisdom that has \n&gt; &gt;&gt; helped\n&gt; &gt;&gt; me. I=\r\n couldn=C3=A2=E2=82=AC=E2=84=A2t believe what god has given. It was like a\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; miracle.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Now I am determined that I would keep doing homams as and=\r\n when\n&gt; &gt; possible\n&gt; &gt;&gt; but japam daily for sure for my rest of the life. I=\r\n am a novice for\n&gt; &gt;&gt; homams so I am learning these things. I often see you=\r\nr youtube video\n&gt; &gt; on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; homams and try to follow this. I hope someday I=\r\n will get some mastery\n&gt; &gt;&gt; over this and do homams regularly without error=\r\ns. Your experiences \n&gt; &gt;&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; stories with Manish Pandit were very ins=\r\npiring throughout this\n&gt; &gt; journey.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Your those real time experiences w=\r\nith Manish were great, they gave me\n&gt; &gt;&gt; credentials that if Narsimha guru =\r\nis writing these things then there\n&gt; &gt;&gt; should be some truth behind this. T=\r\nhat inspired me that if I \n&gt; &gt;&gt; surrender\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to god, god can help me too =\r\nand he really helped me.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; This time I had a material motive behind my h=\r\nomams and japams as I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; wanted to get a full time, but I am sure this ro=\r\nute will take me more\n&gt; &gt;&gt; towards spirituality and some day I would be abl=\r\ne to help society and\n&gt; &gt; to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; this world in some way. ...\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
