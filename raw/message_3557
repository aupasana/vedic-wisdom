Our shastras define sa=\r\nnatana dharma - the perennial path of righteous duty. Sanatana dharma is no=\r\nt an exclusive property of people born to &quot;Hindu&quot; parents. Sanatana dharma =\r\nbelongs to the entire world and encompasses every human being whether or no=\r\nt one realizes it!\n\nSome people who consider themselves Hindus may or may n=\r\not be following dharma well.\n\nThere may not be much difference between some=\r\nbody from another religion with a strong interest in &quot;Hinduism&quot; and somebod=\r\ny born to Hindu parents but having either passive interest or disinterest i=\r\nn Sanatana dharma and teachings of rishis. In fact, the former may be a bet=\r\nter adherent of Sanatana dharma than the latter in some cases! If there is =\r\nno need to convert the latter to &quot;Hinduism&quot;, there is no need to convert th=\r\ne former\n either!\n\nSeveral ceremonies like naamakarana samskaara (naming) a=\r\nre more social customs than dharmik matters.\n\nIn my opinion, if a person is=\r\n given a Vedic or Pouraanik mantra (any) by a decent guru and asked to chan=\r\nt it everyday for an amount of time, and if he/she is exposed to some scrip=\r\nture (e.g. Gita, Upanishads etc) and asked to read it, understand it and le=\r\nt it affect one&#39;s thinking, I think one is then a Hindu, i.e. one will soon=\r\n find oneself adhering to Sanatana dharma. There is no need for any ceremon=\r\nies.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nIn fact, now there are some &quot;foreigners&quot; who perform =\r\na homam every weekend, to Ganapathi, Krishna etc. If anybody thinks they ar=\r\ne not &quot;Hindus&quot;, one is not thinking straight. They are more Hindus than man=\r\ny Hindus in India who have forgotten their dharma.\n\nA braahmana&#39;s dharma is=\r\n to pursue spiritual progress and engage the\n mind in the god for the benef=\r\nit of the world. One who does not spend time in japam or homam for the bene=\r\nfit of the world is not a braahmana. If a foreigner is passionately interes=\r\nted in spiritual progress and does japam or homam every day or week for the=\r\n benefit of the world and one&#39;s own spiritual upliftment, such a foreigner =\r\nis not only a Hindu, but also a braahmana.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=C2=A0 =\r\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yours=\r\nelf&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films th=\r\nat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish =\r\nwritings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n--- On Thu, 1/2=\r\n1/10, gurukkal.shankar &lt;gurukkal.shankar@ yahoo.in&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: gurukkal=\r\n.shankar &lt;gurukkal.shankar@ yahoo.in&gt;\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Reg.Conversio=\r\nn of religion\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\nDate: Thursday, January 21=\r\n, 2010, 12:04 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\nRespected Narasimha sir,\n\nIam refering to the r=\r\necent news of a foreigner being converted in to hinduism at Rameshwaram, si=\r\nnce he is very much interested in our sastras etc..,\n\nWhether this is sanct=\r\nioned in our scripts.if so what all the samskaras to be undertaken.whether =\r\na new horoscope is to be written,namakarana etc.,kindly enlighten.\n\nwith re=\r\nspectes,\n\nS.Ravi Shankar\n\n\n\n\nThe INTERNET now has a personality.

Our shastras defin=\r\ne sanatana dharma - the perennial path of righteous duty. Sanatana dharma i=\r\ns not an exclusive property of people born to &quot;Hindu&quot; parents. Sanatana dha=\r\nrma belongs to the entire world and encompasses every human being whether o=\r\nr not one realizes it!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Some people who consider themselves Hindus ma=\r\ny or may not be following dharma well.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;There may not be much differe=\r\nnce between somebody from another religion with a strong interest in &quot;Hindu=\r\nism&quot; and somebody born to Hindu parents but having either passive interest =\r\nor disinterest in Sanatana dharma and teachings of rishis. In fact, the for=\r\nmer may be a better adherent of Sanatana dharma than the latter in some cas=\r\nes! If there is no need to convert the latter to &quot;Hinduism&quot;, there is no ne=\r\ned to convert the former\n either!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Several ceremonies like naamakaran=\r\na samskaara (naming) are more social customs than dharmik matters.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I=\r\nn my opinion, if a person is given a Vedic or Pouraanik mantra (any) by a d=\r\necent guru and asked to chant it everyday for an amount of time, and if he/=\r\nshe is exposed to some scripture (e.g. Gita, Upanishads etc) and asked to r=\r\nead it, understand it and let it affect one&#39;s thinking, I think one is then=\r\n a Hindu, i.e. one will soon find oneself adhering to Sanatana dharma. Ther=\r\ne is no need for any ceremonies.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In fact, now =\r\nthere are some &quot;foreigners&quot; who perform a homam every weekend, to Ganapathi=\r\n, Krishna etc. If anybody thinks they are not &quot;Hindus&quot;, one is not thinking=\r\n straight. They are more Hindus than many Hindus in India who have forgotte=\r\nn their dharma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;A braahmana&#39;s dharma is to pursue spiritual progress=\r\n and engage the\n mind in the god for the benefit of the world. One who does=\r\n not spend time in japam or homam for the benefit of the world is not a bra=\r\nahmana. If a foreigner is passionately interested in spiritual progress and=\r\n does japam or homam every day or week for the benefit of the world and one=\r\n&#39;s own spiritual upliftment, such a foreigner is not only a Hindu, but also=\r\n a braahmana.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish S=\r\noftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual=\r\n manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; class=3D&quot;moz-txt-link-freetext&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/a&gt; rologer.org&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; class=3D&quot;m=\r\noz-txt-link-freetext&quot;\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifil/&quot;&gt;http=\r\n://SaraswatiFil&lt;/a&gt; ms.org &lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: &lt;a re=\r\nl=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; class=3D&quot;moz-txt-link-freetext&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://groups/&quot;&gt;http://groups&lt;/a&gt;. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;br&gt;&nbsp; J=\r\nyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; class=3D&quot;moz-txt-link-freetext&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups/&quot;&gt;http://groups&lt;/a&gt;. yahoo.com/ group/Jyo=\r\ntishWri tings&lt;br&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- -&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On &lt;b&gt;Thu, 1/21/10, gurukkal.shankar &lt;i&gt;&lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; class=3D&quot;moz-txt-link-rfc2396E&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://us.mc1111.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dgurukkal.shankar@...&quot;&gt;&lt=\r\n;gurukkal.shankar@ yahoo.in&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D=\r\n&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255);&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;From: gurukkal.shankar &lt;g=\r\nurukkal.shankar@ yahoo.in&gt;&lt;br&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Reg.Conversion of =\r\nreligion&lt;br&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;br&gt;Date: Thursday, January 2=\r\n1, 2010, 12:04 PM&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1297534391&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;d=\r\niv id=3D&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Respected Narasimha sir,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Iam refering to t=\r\nhe recent news of a foreigner being converted in to hinduism at Rameshwaram=\r\n, since he is very much interested in our sastras etc..,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Whether thi=\r\ns is sanctioned in our scripts.if so what all the samskaras to be undertake=\r\nn.whether a new horoscope is to be written,namakarana etc.,kindly enlighten=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;with respectes,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;S.Ravi Shankar&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b=\r\nlockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/=\r\ntd&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;\nThe INTERNET now has a persona=\r\nlity.
