Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; Thank you for the story. This parable is absolutely brilliant.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I =\r\njust want to point out one thing in the story. When the first robber (tamas=\r\n) wanted to kill, the second robber (rajas) interrupted him and executed hi=\r\ns preference instead. However, the third robber (sattwa) could help only wh=\r\nen the other two were away. This is very apt.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When one has both rajas=\r\n and tamas, rajas is capable of overriding tamas. However, sattwa will flou=\r\nrish only when tamas and rajas are suppressed mostly. Sattwa will be passiv=\r\ne when one also has considerable amounts of rajas or tamas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One with =\r\na lot of tamas can increase rajas temporarily and make some progress. As a =\r\nsimple example, laziness in the matter of spiritual progress (i.e. tamas) c=\r\nan be replaced with doing several rituals and reading books passionately (r=\r\najas). It is difficult to transition from tamas to sattwa straight away. As=\r\n one engages in rituals, reading books and contemplation, slowly the passio=\r\nn (rajas) is replaced by steadiness and equanimity (sattwa). When sattwa be=\r\ncomes predominant in one&#39;s personality and rajas and tamas become negligibl=\r\ne, one starts to make tremendous progress. But, until that happens, rajas i=\r\ns useful to have!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/=\r\nvedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.n=\r\net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyot=\r\nish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; Sri Jagannath=\r\n Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ----------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message=\r\n ----- \n&gt;   From: Prasanth Jalasutram \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, October 06, 2009 =\r\n3:09 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Sri Ramakrishna Parable About Satva, Ra=\r\njas, And Lamas Gunas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Once, a man was going through a forest, when=\r\n three robbers fell upon him and robbed him of all his possessions. One of =\r\nthe robbers said, &quot;What&#39;s the use of keeping this man alive?&quot; So saying, he=\r\n was about to kill him with his sword, when the second robber interrupted h=\r\nim, saying: &#39;Oh, no! What is the use of killing him? Tie his hand and foot =\r\nand leave him here.&quot; The robbers bound his hands and feet and went away. Af=\r\nter a while the third robber returned and said to the man: &quot;Ah, I am sorry.=\r\n Are you hurt? I will release you from your bonds.&quot; After setting the man f=\r\nree, the thief said: &quot;Come with me. I will take you to the public high way.=\r\n&quot; After a long time they reached the road. At this the man said: &quot;Sir, you =\r\nhave been very good to me. Come with me to my house.&quot; &quot;Oh,no!&quot; the robber r=\r\neplied. &quot;I can&#39;t go there. The police will know it.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;   This world itse=\r\nlf is the forest. The three robbers prowling here are Satva, rajas, and lam=\r\nas. It is they that rob a man of the Knowledge of Truth. Tamas wants to des=\r\ntroy him.Rajas binds him to the world.\n&gt; \n&gt;   But Satva rescues him from th=\r\ne clutches of rajas and tamas. Under the protection of Satva, man is rescue=\r\nd from anger, passion and other evil effects of tamas.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Further, Satv=\r\na loosens the bonds of the world. But Satva also is a robber. It cannot giv=\r\ne man the ultimate Knowledge of Truth, though it shows him the road leading=\r\n to the Supreme Abode of God.Setting him on the path, Satva tells him: &quot;Loo=\r\nk yonder. There is your home.&quot; Even Satva is far away from the knowledge of=\r\n Brahman.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Source: Tales and Parables of Sri Ramakrishna\n&gt;   --\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
