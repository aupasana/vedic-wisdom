One who has been to Andhra and tasted the Banginapalli mango may swear that Banginapalli is the only real mango. One who has been to north India and tasted the Dussehri mango may swear that Dussehri is the only real mango.\n \nBut, what about one who lives elsewhere in India and has not tasted any of these mangoes? He may eat some other locally available mango, which may also be tasty though not as good as these three. In fact, people living in US may have to be contented with Champagne mangoes from Mexico.\n \nSimilarly, there are many Gayatri mantras in Veda as it is available to us, including the popular Savitru Gayatri mantra that is simply known as Gayatri mantra. There may be other mantras that are not available to the public and revealed to one only when one makes progress and experiences a particular state.\n \nIf you have access only to a Kesar mango or Champagne mango, just enjoy it and don&#39;t compare it to something that you have no access to!\n \nThe Savitru Gayatri mantra is powerful too. Otherwise, why would Maharshi Viswamitra bother to reveal it to the world and why would so many people use it?\n \nMost of what I experienced and realized came from sadhana with Savitru Gayatri mantra. I have no doubt that it is useful and sufficient.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Jyotisa Shisya &lt;achyutagaddi@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Narasimha, namaste and pranaams.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me give an example. Gayatri mantra gives spiritual purification and\n&gt; &gt; self-realization. Maharshi Viswamitra freely shared it with the entire\n&gt; &gt; world. However, when it came to its variations such as Bala and Atibala,\n&gt; &gt; he taught them only to Lord Ramachandra and kept &gt;them secretive! Why?\n&gt; \n&gt; In the books by Robert Svoboda, Vimalananda emphatically asserts that the\n&gt; &quot;true&quot; Gayatri is hidden and available only to the rishis. Manish has also\n&gt; given this opinion.\n&gt; \n&gt; If this is indeed the case, then what is the relative importance of the\n&gt; Gayatri mantra given in Rg Veda?\n&gt; \n&gt; best regards\n&gt; Hari\n\n\n"}}
