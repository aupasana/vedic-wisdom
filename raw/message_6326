I felt a huge/warm/friendsly connec=\r\ntion to the whole process, the meditation after wards was also beautiful. T=\r\nhis short homam + meditation (15min+15min) was atleast 50 times better than=\r\n vishnu sahastranaam homam.\n\nOnce i am able to perfect this devotion/connec=\r\ntion then i will slowly move to Vishnu sahastranam homam. for time being i =\r\ndo VS puja separately in morning.\n\nAlso to bring my mind on the glories of =\r\nNarayan, before homam i read 1 dasakam/chapter(10 shloks)of narayaneeyam. (=\r\n1 chapter contain 10 shloks and it is summary study in poetic form of the B=\r\nhagavata Purana. total 100 chapters)(One chapter one day takes only\n5min an=\r\nd gives mind new food of Narayans glory)(I read it for myself in english to=\r\n know the glories myself)\n\nthank you PVR so much for all your guidance.\n\nre=\r\ngards\nPriyank\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, you can do that.

Sun is representative of God in the univers=\r\ne that we can \n&gt; &gt; perceive. Fire is Sun&#39;s representative on earth. The mor=\r\ne people doing \n&gt; &gt; fire ritual and giving back to Sun god, the better it i=\r\ns for \n&gt; &gt; maintaining our world smoothly. The more the merrier.\n&gt; &gt; Even s=\r\ntarting a fire, sitting in front of it with reverence and a \n&gt; &gt; sense of s=\r\nacredness, making a few offerings to fire even without any \n&gt; &gt; words and m=\r\neditating in front of fire, is sufficient and conducive to \n&gt; &gt; spiritual p=\r\nrogress. The steps we use in fire ritual are designed to \n&gt; &gt; promote that =\r\nsense of sacredness and reverence and focus. Feel free to \n&gt; &gt; use the step=\r\ns that make sense to you. But the key is to have the sense \n&gt; &gt; of sacredne=\r\nss and reverence for fire, the belief that god is in fire \n&gt; &gt; and devotion=\r\n to god. If that is there to some extent to start with, \n&gt; &gt; fire will ampl=\r\nify it and increase it in the long run.\n&gt; &gt; For Narasimha homam, use &quot;kShrA=\r\nM&quot; as beeja, &quot;kShrIM&quot; as shakti and \n&gt; &gt; &quot;kShraum&quot; as keelaka.

There are many mantras th=\r\nat can be used for the pradhaana \n&gt; &gt; homam.
