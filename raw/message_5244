Shiva and Vishnu had unconditional love and devotion for each other.=\r\n They are not like normal human beings and their relationships, such as lov=\r\ne and devotion, are not governed by petty notions of superiority and depend=\r\nence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The Shaivite-Vaishnavite distinctions and the biases of Kali =\r\nyuga are unfortunate. Nevertheless, I am willing to tolerate biases and clo=\r\nsed-mindedness. Closed-mindedness is ok as long as one is making some progr=\r\ness with one&#39;s own belief system.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; One climbing a moun=\r\ntain has to choose one of the available paths. Whether one acknowledges tha=\r\nt several mountain paths lead to the mountain top or whether one believes t=\r\nhat only the path one has chosen leads to the top, is not that important. A=\r\ns long as one is climbing the mountain in one&#39;s chosen path, one is doing a=\r\nlright!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; After all, there may be many paths around the hill. One may=\r\n be unable to see paths on the other side of the mountain or even distant p=\r\naths on the same side. If one does not think much of those paths and focuse=\r\ns on climbing in one&#39;s own path, that does no harm.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As one reaches =\r\nthe top, it gets narrower and one may see the other paths that seemed quite=\r\n distant earlier to be quite nearby now. As one is very close to the top, o=\r\nne will see that all paths are leading there. When one is on the top, one s=\r\nees all paths to converge there. After god-realization, one sees various pa=\r\nths to be valid paths to god. Of course, different paths come with differen=\r\nt obstacles. One path may have some snow. One path may be too steep. One pa=\r\nth may be slippery. One path may have falling rocks. One path may have fall=\r\nen trees blocking it. And so on. But, one on the top knows that people can =\r\nreach there using several paths, if they are committed to overcoming the ob=\r\nstacles and reaching the top.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let people follow the paths chosen by=\r\n them and wish them good luck to reach the top in their own paths. Let them=\r\n say whatever they want to say about your path. It does not matter. If YOU =\r\nhave conviction and faith, you just walk your path and reach the top!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The problem is that some people are doing no sadhana reall=\r\ny, making no progress really and yet passing judgments on other paths and g=\r\netting into fights. They are like people at the base of the mountain, tryin=\r\ng to block people from some paths and trying to enroll them in their path. =\r\nThey may fight with people and kill them too. They stay at the base forever=\r\n and never reach the top. They are a problem.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But, people with narr=\r\now views who do some sadhana and make progress are ok. They are on some pat=\r\nh and will eventually reach god. For example, so many Krishna bhaktas who l=\r\nook down upon Shiva as a lower demigod may be doing their mantra several ma=\r\nlas a day with a good level of devotion and they will eventually make progr=\r\ness. I know Vaishnavas in some sampradayas who do not even worship Ganesha =\r\nas he is &quot;from Shiva&#39;s family&quot; and worship Vishvaksena at the start of thei=\r\nr poojas instead of Ganesha. But, they do no harm to anyone, try to see all=\r\n human beings as Vishnu&#39;s forms, try to serve all and keep their austeritie=\r\ns. Bottomline is that they are doing some sadhana and will eventually make =\r\nprogress.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Let us not worry about people who are doing some sadhana =\r\nand progressing. Any deficiencies in their understanding will be addressed =\r\nin due course.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Keep doing enough sadhana to burn=\r\n the conditioning and keep making progress.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Naras=\r\nimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Your=\r\nself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish w=\r\nritings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; ----------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I hardly disagree with=\r\n your views but for Iskcon I have my own thoughts,no doubt on Shri Prabhupa=\r\nda and his mission to spread Shri Krishna&#39;s awareness but many times(After =\r\nexit of Shri Prabhupada)on numerous occasions I found their views very bias=\r\ned towards Shri Shivji and for that reason I have my reservations and those=\r\n views of mine are not my own views as some senior ex-Iskconites too share =\r\nsame views like me.If I am allowed to speak I have seen very few shivites s=\r\npeaking hard stuff like them for opposite side.(Shri Hari or Shri Krishna),=\r\nnot even that well known astrologer Sanjay Rath once posted a separate proc=\r\nedures for Vaishnavas to do Mahamrityunjaya japam using Shri Veda Vyasa&#39;s n=\r\name instead of Shri Vasishtha mantra(Vam Vasishthaya Namah) !

If you see an elephant car=\r\nefully, your mind may be able to capture all of its details well. If you re=\r\nad thousands of books on an elephant without having ever seen one, you may =\r\nstill not be able imagine an elephant. Moreover, you may find different boo=\r\nks to be contradictory.

If you see an elephant yourself=\r\n oneday, you will realize then that books that seemed contradictory once ar=\r\ne not that contradictory after all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Srila Prabhupada was undoub=\r\ntedly a great saint. To go abroad without even knowing anyone there at an a=\r\ndvanced age to spread Krishna bhakti, to roam New York streets without prop=\r\ner shoes or clothing in winter, requires tremendous surrender. Based on pre=\r\nvious samskaras, some may not be attracted to his interpretations. But that=\r\n does not take away anything from them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My personal favorite is=\r\n Lord Jnaneshwar&#39;s take on Bhagavad Gita and I also like Aadi Shankara&#39;s co=\r\nmmentary overall. However, Srila Prabhupada&#39;s commentary is fine too and it=\r\n is perfect for people with certain samskaras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sophisticated an=\r\nd complicated Upanishadic ideas are not palatable to everyone. They need to=\r\n be simplified. Especially, people from monotheistic belief systems and sub=\r\nscription based religions need simpler models of divinity. So Upanishads an=\r\nd scriptures need to be interpreted so as to be palatable to them. So many =\r\ngreat saints came and interpreted scriptures slightly differently, because =\r\nthere are different groups of people with different samkaras waiting to be =\r\nguided by them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; My philosophy is simple. Read what appeals to y=\r\nou. Follow what you are able to. But, in the end, reading tomes about eleph=\r\nant are only the starting point.

The language is quite complex by today&#39;=\r\ns standards (even in telugu), so I always have this doubt if I am reading i=\r\nt enough and interpreting right? But I keep trying to read as I love that p=\r\noetry by the great poet Potana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nagraj\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; --- On Wed, 11/10/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] O=\r\nn Astrologers and Priests\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, vedic=\r\n-astrology@yahoogroups.com, JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: We=\r\ndnesday, November 10, 2010, 6:05 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The two mails below on priests doing remedies and astrologers hav=\r\ne a common thread. I will reply to them together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 1 below on priests:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Doing rituals for one&#39;s own upliftment is one thing and doing it for other=\r\ns is another. In the former, one is cleaning up a dirty place that one is f=\r\norced to live in. In the latter, one is going to someone else&#39;s dirty place=\r\n and cleaning it up. If there is some radioactive waste there and one is no=\r\nt protected, one may be affected.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I keep saying, res=\r\nults of one&#39;s previous karmas are like fruits lying in a basket. One takes =\r\nout one fruit after another and eats them. Some may be tasty and some may b=\r\ne bitter or rotten. When one does rituals and other spiritual sadhana, the =\r\ndeities throw away some bad fruits into a trash can and make one eat good f=\r\nruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be some spillage as dirty fruit=\r\ns are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be affected=\r\n by the spillage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days, priests did intense =\r\nsadhana and generated enough purity to handle such things. Many priests of =\r\ntoday do not do enough penance. They are quite vulnerable as they start mes=\r\nsing with other people&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, many priests=\r\n of today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to a brah=\r\nmana father is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become a brahman=\r\na oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-like. M=\r\nany brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of money or=\r\n of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. They =\r\nare not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas on ear=\r\nth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for others o=\r\nnly by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influence, m=\r\noney and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, stop doing rit=\r\nuals for others. Or, do enough individual penance when you are not doing ri=\r\ntuals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in=\r\n Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by o=\r\nvercoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding mail 2 below on astrol=\r\nogers:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is not an immature comment and there is an =\r\nelement of truth in it. A lot of what I said above applies here too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Every action performed with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;=\r\n) produces an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action of giving advice to=\r\n someone resulted in that person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads=\r\n and experiencing Z instead of W in coming years, there is clearly an actio=\r\nn here. If the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one is =\r\nbound to experience the fruits of it. Some blessings can come and some suff=\r\nerings can come too.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s karmas=\r\n is always a risky business.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What is the solution? Well=\r\n, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle describ=\r\ned in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana=\r\n by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas. Ir=\r\nrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahmana=\r\n if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karmas =\r\nof others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again, t=\r\no be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmanas =\r\nby conduct.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The above will become clear, if you look at=\r\n the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught=\r\n Jyotish!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jy=\r\notish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a differenc=\r\ne: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 1:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.r=\r\nudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering =\r\nfrom any curse(Shapam)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This I am asking after seeing the overa=\r\nll and general condition of Brahmanas specially those who do pujas for Yajm=\r\nanas and involved in Karmakanda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And if this is true is there a=\r\nny remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the only place where we can=\r\n discuss this subject hence I am posting this query here.Thanks a lot in ad=\r\nvance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mail 2:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaj=\r\ni and other educated Scholars,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I have just started =\r\nlistening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training sessions and am very eager t=\r\no review my own chart.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However in numerous instance=\r\ns in the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and close uncles that astrology c=\r\nan have a severe adverse impact on yourself (astrologer) and yrou family. T=\r\nhis may sound a very immature comment, but I thought I should get your opin=\r\nion / thoughts on this before I proceed on this journey.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I would appreciate getting a honest response so I can put this issue =\r\nto rest once and for all.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Raj\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PS: I am drawn to astology more from an academic pe=\r\nrspective of how it influences our life and how ignorant we are of this pow=\r\ner around us.
