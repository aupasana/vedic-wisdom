We must protect the dignity and self respe=\r\nct of everybody. We\nare members of the human family and hence we must respe=\r\nct others and not\ncome in the way of their wholesome aspirations in life. A=\r\nlthough it is\nexcellent that we imbibe gentlemanliness we must never bloat =\r\nabout it i.e.\ndo not blow your own trumpet of greatness. Right from having =\r\nconversations\nwith others and other day to day transactions this sort of di=\r\nscipline must\nbe observed. Even when others do not cooperate or that if you=\r\n are facing\nharsh times never give up your gentlemanly character. At all co=\r\nsts\nindiscipline must be shunned like plague. When out of wrath we hurl abu=\r\nses\nand insults at others know for sure that we are exhibiting our inner lo=\r\nwly\nstature. Even while dealing with the ugliest natured individuals never =\r\nlose\nyour mental calm.\n\nCivic scriptures elucidate many methods whereby wit=\r\nhout harming others or\ncoming in their way we can safely lead a hallowed li=\r\nfestyle. We all have\ndifferent notions of how to lead a wholesome life. Hen=\r\nce it is most\nimportant that every individual tries to understand the other=\r\ns viewpoint\nwithout bias or prejudice. Never say =91only my viewpoint is ri=\r\nght and that\nyou must follow the same=92. We must ourselves first understan=\r\nd and then help\nothers understand and studiously stay away from verbal duel=\r\ns unless of\ncourse in those rare and exceptional case it cannot be adhered =\r\nto.\n\nWe must behave with others exactly in the way which we like others to =\r\nbehave\nwith us. It encompasses not only politeness and etiquette but al tho=\r\nse\nactions which augment others comfort and never inflicts ill will on them=\r\n.\nTime management should be given due respect, one must abide by the promis=\r\nes\ngiven to others (accountability) and be committed to ones daily duties. =\r\nAll\nthese will ensure that you will slowly but surely climb peaks of glory.=\r\n\nNever promise something which is beyond your ken and reach. To establish a=\r\n\nbond of trust never act distrustfully. Human glory goes down the drain whe=\r\nn\nby using criminal means a person tries to fulfill his selfish desires. On=\r\ne\nmust religiously abstain from such means of earning wealth. Today in the\n=\r\neconomic arena foul, ethical and illegal means for earning wealth is on an\n=\r\nalarming rise. Laborers put in only 50% effort, businessmen loot their\ncust=\r\nomers by taking exorbitant profits and criminal minded people walk\nfreely i=\r\nn society with total disdain for law and order. Hence it should be\nseen to =\r\nit that not only should we refrain from such criminal leanings but\nthat nev=\r\ner allow others to do so too.\n\nJust as good behavior means gentlemanliness =\r\nand humility it also connotes\ncooperation and generosity. One must respect =\r\nothers rights and give them\nmore importance. Only after doing so should we =\r\nlook into our needs. Duty\nshould be given primary importance and rights sho=\r\nuld be secondary only.\n\nDue respect should be given to others independence.=\r\n Never coerce on others\nyour views and beliefs however wholesome they may b=\r\ne. Yes you may talk about\nthese to only those who lead unethical lives and =\r\nhave become anti social in\ntheir behavior. It is totally undesirable to ram=\r\n your beliefs down other\npeople=92s throats. None should be obstructed from=\r\n availing the benefits of\nthought independence and basic human rights.\n\nThe=\r\n protocol and etiquette executed when meetings and social transactions\ntake=\r\n place are based on nationality, time and credentials. Its prime goal is\nto=\r\n respect others, cooperate with them and express ones good character. Thus\n=\r\nkeeping in mind the saying =91In Rome do as the Romans do=92 we must\nenthus=\r\niastically imbibe wholesome traditions and etiquette of other\ncountries whe=\r\nn we visit them.\n\nCivic sciences, Social sciences, Political sciences and E=\r\nconomics opine that\nman has been given apt basis and advice to execute his =\r\nsocial\nresponsibilities. Hence the onus is with him to understand their dee=\r\np import\nand then imbibe them in his daily living. Social arrangements have=\r\n been\ndesigned so as to honor those who perform their duties zealously and =\r\npunish\nthose who err in this respect. All governments of the world have mad=\r\ne apt\nlaws, established armies, jails etc in order to establish discipline =\r\nin\nsociety. In turn this helps obstruct anti social elements from prolifera=\r\nting\nin society. In society one sees both praise and insult and opposition =\r\nand\nproposition. In our individual life when we contact those around us thi=\r\ns\nvery process in the form of reactions, pondering over various topics,\nopp=\r\nosition and lack of cooperation is witnessed. Even with our kith and kin\nou=\r\nr one eye manifests love and the other eye discipline so as to reform\ntheir=\r\n unwholesome habits and thinking.\n\nTraditions in which vile activities have=\r\n forced their way in should be\nremoved totally and should be replaced with =\r\nwholesome activities. Never\nshould we give our consent to undesirable habit=\r\ns, blind beliefs and\nerroneous activities. Instead if the need arises opt f=\r\nor the method of non\ncooperation and oppose these strongly until they are w=\r\needed out from their\nvery roots. Further we must always encourage activitie=\r\ns and stands that aim\nat augmenting wholesome activities and thinking which=\r\n will ultimately\nbenefit the entire world. Another important point to note =\r\nis regarding our\nvoting rights. Whenever we go for voting we must keep in m=\r\nind the\ncredentials and character of the person standing for elections. Whi=\r\nle voting\nalways harbor a neutral mind and vote for the best person who has=\r\n long term\nbeneficial goals in mind. In this context honesty, accountabilit=\r\ny and\ncommitment on the part of whom you vote for should be kept in mind.\nV=\r\nociferously denounce those whose aims are selfish gains at the cost of\nsoci=\r\nety=92s uplifting. Instead encourage the qualities of congregational\nwholes=\r\nome activities, cooperation and camaraderie.\n\nThe aim of world humanity sho=\r\nuld be brotherhood and unity on the lines of A\nBEAUTIFUL BORDERLESS WORLD. =\r\nThe high walls of disparity and differences must\nbe destroyed once and for =\r\nall. There should be no discrimination based on\nones caste, community and g=\r\nender. We must all work hard to herald a new\nworld which will exist eternal=\r\nly as a prosperous united family. Global\nefforts on a war footing are requi=\r\nred to form a global nation, a unique\nglobal language, a scientific religio=\r\nn and a world culture that will bind\nall human beings and other creatures w=\r\nith a sense of oneness and\nbrotherhood. All those biases and prejudices tha=\r\nt hamper world unity must be\ndiscarded from their very fount.\n\nThe axis of =\r\nan individual is his/her family. A family can be compared to a\nnation. A fa=\r\nmily is akin to a factory that shapes jewel like and great\ncitizens of thei=\r\nr country. If the institution called a family the world over\nis well manage=\r\nd and progressive in a wholesome way not only will individual\nglory flouris=\r\nh but that society and the world at large too will prosper both\nmaterially =\r\nand spiritually. All world denizens will thus experience joy,\navail materia=\r\nl comforts and advance by leaps and bounds through the\ninstitution of a bal=\r\nanced family. Never should this tiny looking family be\nignored and instead =\r\nit should be well managed and made prosperous in an\nethical manner. We all =\r\nknow that the goal of a prosperous family is\ncleanliness both within and wi=\r\nthout, hard work, cooperation, progressiveness\nand living well within ones =\r\nmeans. The more these ideals are absorbed the\nmore the family atmosphere ex=\r\nudes grandeur and culture. Every member of such\nfamilies will doubtlessly e=\r\nxperience a radiant and prosperous future.\n\nIn order to sacredly reform the=\r\n institution of family life Yuga Nirman\nMission has taken up the cause of W=\r\nomen=92s Awakening. This gigantic program\nencompasses wholesome give and ta=\r\nke of thoughts and thus lay down the firm\nfoundation stones of the ADVENT O=\r\nF A BRIGHT FUTURE IN THE 21st CENTURY.\n\n\n............ to be continued .....=\r\n...........\n\nAuthor : Pt shriram Sharma Acharya\n\n-- \nThank you and Have a F=\r\nulfilling Day\n\nVenkat Koppaka\n\r\n--0015175cddee86da99046fad822b\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Dear ALL,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;3) WHOLESOME SOCIAL BEHAVIOR-DISCIPLINE AND ETIQUETTE: It is most required=\r\n that when we come in contact with other our behavior should be polite and =\r\ngentlemanly.
