[Warning: Those who are sensitive to offensive writings shou=\r\nld skip the \n&gt;next three paragraphs.]\n&gt; \n&gt; Jeffrey Kripal from Univ of Chic=\r\nago visited Ramakrishna Mission in West Bengal \n&gt;and did research on Ramakr=\r\nishna Paramahamsa. Several people there \n&gt;enthusiastically helped him in th=\r\ne researches. In the end, what he produced is \n&gt;utterly nonsensical and fil=\r\nled with lies. He published his PhD dissertation \n&gt;without showing it to Ra=\r\nmakrishna Mission people to check for factual or \n&gt;linguistic inaccuracies.=\r\n Ramakrishna mission people found out about what he \n&gt;produced only years l=\r\nater, after his book &quot;Kali&#39;s Child&quot; based on the PhD \n&gt;dissertation won gre=\r\nat acclaim in the West. He won an award at the Americal \n&gt;Academy of Religi=\r\non for that book, landed a job at Harvard and his book was \n&gt;sadly mentione=\r\nd in the Encyclopedia Britannica as the *number one* choice for \n&gt;learning =\r\nabout Ramakrishna.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the book, he portrayed Ramakrishna as a sexually=\r\n perverted person, a \n&gt;homosexual and a pedophile. He did not know Bengali =\r\nor Hindi or Sanskrit well \n&gt;and did not take help from any Bengali people a=\r\nt the Mission for this work. He \n&gt;used his own faulty translations, willful=\r\n distortions and manipulation of \n&gt;sources to arrive at sensational (and da=\r\nmning) conclusions. For example, he \n&gt;translated a word that means &quot;lap&quot; as=\r\n &quot;genitals&quot;, in the context of Swami \n&gt;Brahmananda (spiritual son of Ramakr=\r\nishna and a young boy then) sitting in \n&gt;Ramakrishna&#39;s lap. He translated a=\r\n word that means &quot;touching softly&quot; as \n&gt;&quot;uncontrollably rubbing sandalpaste=\r\n on the penises of boys&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even in places where there was no material t=\r\no mis-translate, he simply \n&gt;speculated! For example, he speculated on the =\r\nmeeting of Totapuri and \n&gt;Ramakrishna, in which the naaga sadhu (naked asce=\r\ntic) Totapuri taught advaita \n&gt;vedanta to Ramakrishna and made him go beyon=\r\nd Mother Kali and experience \n&gt;nirvikalpa samadhi: &quot;What it must have been =\r\nlike for Ramakrishna, a homosexually \n&gt;oriented man, to be shut away for da=\r\nys in a small hut with another, stark-naked \n&gt;man. Vedanta instruction or n=\r\not, it was this man&#39;s nudity, and more especially, \n&gt;his penis, that normal=\r\nly caught Ramakrishna&#39;s attention. How could it not?&quot; \n&gt;Please note that he=\r\n is not referring to any source and mis-translating it, but \n&gt;simply specul=\r\nating based on his perverted agenda!\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; If you see the book, y=\r\nou will see many examples of such pseudo-scholarship \n&gt;driven by heinous ag=\r\nendas.
