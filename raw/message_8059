An enlightened master cannot be\nmeasur=\r\ned with definitions of mind and intellect bound by time and space. I\nperson=\r\nally liked the message from Sri.Narasimhaji on the fact that we\ncannot defi=\r\nne these things with Vaikhari.\n\nA gyani(Jeevan Mukta) is beyond karmic bond=\r\nage and uses gunas as tools in\nthe interest of the world and does not accum=\r\nulate new vasanas however he\nwill indeed have prarabdha karma. Arrows that =\r\nhave left the bow cannot but\nstrike the target though master can change vel=\r\nocity and trajectory.\n\nIn once instance, i heard of a story when Bhagwan Ra=\r\nmana or Paramacharya\nasked a devotee to stay back in his ashram as an astro=\r\nloger predicted a\nlife threat to the devotee. Let us note that Bhagwan has =\r\nchanged the\ndestiny by cut and paste into future lives of the devotee or ta=\r\nken over his\nkarma. Very few masters out of kindness do it.\n\nIn the case Ar=\r\njuna, let us note that he never went to heaven during his\nlast days and in =\r\nfact fell off on his way to heaven. Only Dharmaraja who is\nhis eldest broth=\r\ner went to heaven finally as he also accumulated certain\nkarmas from his ac=\r\ntions. Obviously Arjuna  is not jeevanmukta though he did\nhave a purpose wh=\r\ny he came down with Narayana himself.\n\nIrrespective of Arjuna&#39;s prowess, af=\r\nter Lord Krishna left his mortal body,\nArjuna became like a ineffective war=\r\nrior for sometime and had to pray to\nLord to regain his prowess which means=\r\n that without the touch of divine, we\nwill screw up even normal nitya, naim=\r\nittika karmas. Maya is powerful even\nwith best faculties,\n\n&quot;Mahatma who liv=\r\ne in awareness and abiding in  &quot;Self&quot; is a &quot;mukta&quot; is\nrelieved of effects o=\r\nf Karma&quot; Karma is like a tool and the disease they\nhandle in relation to th=\r\neir body is affect of minor residue of past karmas\n.It is said that when Bh=\r\nisma was lying on his bed of arrows, he revealed\nbefore Lord Krisha that he=\r\n has reviewed his previous 99 lives (an instance\nof self pastlife regressio=\r\nn) but could not find relevant sanchit karma for\nthis bed of the arrows. Th=\r\nen Vasudev, advised him to review his 100\nprevious life. When Bheesm the Pi=\r\ntamah remembered his 100 life it became\napparent to him that he was a king =\r\nin that life and while traveling on a\nhorse, he found a snake in his route,=\r\n he picked up an arrow and threw the\nsnake on nailed bushes. The snake was =\r\nreborn as Arjuna in this life. Even\nJivan Mukta is bound by laws of karma b=\r\nut being a gyani is untouched by it\nand is in alignment with nature and nev=\r\ner breaks laws of karma.\n\n&quot;Gahana karmano gatih\n\nI remain at HER Feet\nSrika=\r\nnth\nOn Tue, Mar 20, 2012 at 9:53 AM, vvootla &lt;vvootla@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; =\r\n**\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Nope. Arjuna was not a Jivan muktha or even vidEha muktha that=\r\n life. One\n&gt; tradition states that Arjuna re-incarnated as Kannappa (Bhakta=\r\n Kannappa)\n&gt; who becomes a devotee of Shiva (remember that in Mahabharat it=\r\nself the seed\n&gt; for this was sown in an episode that Arjuna and Shiva fight=\r\n for a wild boar\n&gt; they hunted). It is in that Kannappa life that he attain=\r\ns to mukti at srI\n&gt; kALahasti. In Kurukshetra war, Arjuna arrives at a cert=\r\nain state of\n&gt; unconditioned awareness or consciousness due to the dilemma =\r\nand\n&gt; circumstances of the war and Krishna utilized that receptivity(arisin=\r\ng out\n&gt; of utter helplessness and hence willingness to surrender) to give h=\r\nim\n&gt; glimpses of the Virat swarupam. You can liken the viswaroopam event to=\r\n\n&gt; Ramakrishna making Narendra experience divinity by placing his feet on t=\r\nhe\n&gt; chest.\n&gt;\n&gt; I think Narasimha gAru&#39;s second post on jIvan mukta was rel=\r\natively\n&gt; straight and clear on the concept. The other points I&#39;ll add is t=\r\nhat action\n&gt; done by tri-karanas do result in consequence(s) to the doer (a=\r\ns long as the\n&gt; action was done while doer holds conditioned identity). All=\r\n this\n&gt; accumulates in the sanchita (warehouse) of the doer and a portion o=\r\nf it\n&gt; gets allotted as prarabdha for a given life. This prarabdha one has =\r\nto\n&gt; experience whether they are liberated or not. Removal of conditioning =\r\ndoes\n&gt; drop the entire Sanchita (breaks the thread that is holding the Sanc=\r\nhita to\n&gt; the being) but prarabdha itself holds as this was already allotte=\r\nd and in\n&gt; itself is the primary cause for the embodied life of that being.=\r\n If you\n&gt; drop prarabdha you drop the body and hence life too. Because that=\r\n karmic\n&gt; structure is what glues the jIva and the sarIra. A jIvan mukta ha=\r\nd dropped\n&gt; all conditioning and hence his bondages to all sanchita is gone=\r\n. No new\n&gt; bondage is established for newer actions (agAmi) because the act=\r\nions now\n&gt; are not conditioned by any kind of ignorance(mAya). These action=\r\ns\n&gt; themselves can have consequences but they are not tied to him and hence=\r\n not\n&gt; attached/directed at him. They &#39;can&#39; even attack their prArabdha to =\r\nalter\n&gt; it if neeeded, but as they had already become pure witnesses than a=\r\ngenda\n&gt; driven conditioned individuals, they generally don&#39;t get into that =\r\nand\n&gt; experience all of their prarabdha to let it burn naturally. They also=\r\n have\n&gt; capabilities to create and accumulate &#39;conscious and measured quant=\r\nity and\n&gt; quality of sanchita&#39; to be available as prarabdha for a future li=\r\nfe, if\n&gt; they intend to re-incarnate. However, whether the &#39;veil of mAya&#39; w=\r\nas put\n&gt; consciously by oneself or was eternally present as we forgot that =\r\nwe put it\n&gt; ourselves, as long as the veil is on us there will be an amount=\r\n of\n&gt; conditioning and ignorance. The main difference is that just as a man=\r\n who\n&gt; puts a veil on his face sees blurred but is fully aware that he can =\r\nanytime\n&gt; lift the veil at his own will to see through clearly, a re-incarn=\r\nated\n&gt; avatAra also knows that the veil of mAya was put on for a purpose an=\r\nd can\n&gt; be dropped once the purpose is served. The case of rest of us is th=\r\nat of a\n&gt; man who put the veil a long time ago but totally forgot about tha=\r\nt i.e. a)\n&gt; that the veil exists and is interfering with his vision and b) =\r\nthat the\n&gt; veil was put by himself and it is within his own control to remo=\r\nve it.\n&gt; Hence we do all sadhana to recognize that distinction between the =\r\nveil and\n&gt; ourselves and thus drop the veil.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; -Prasad\n&gt;\n&gt; ---=\r\n In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Namaste - Well, I still don&#39;t get it.

One&#39;s experiences and actions are due to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the momen=\r\ntum set in motion by previously present conditioning. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; engages in =\r\nthem with no agendas, likes, dislikes, and attachments.\n&gt; Thus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a jee=\r\nvanmukta operates the previous identity till the momentum comes\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\na screeching halt and then the body, senses, sensory mind, buddhi etc\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n are returned to the original sources from which they were borrowed and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; made sentient. But a jeevanmukta is free and unbound even while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; op=\r\nerating with an identity, for binding comes from the conditioning\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; not from identification or actions. When the identity dissolves, it is\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; not any better or any extra freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Most likely, a jeevan=\r\nmukta ceases to operate an identity after some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; time, that time depend=\r\ning on the strength of prior momentum! It can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; days or months or ye=\r\nars or centuries or millennia.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nature sets such powerful moment=\r\num in place for some beings (e.g.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that=\r\n they may operate an identity for a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; very long time after conditioning=\r\n drops off completely. It may even be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for the entire duration of Crea=\r\ntion.

I wasn=\r\n&#39;t perhaps clear enough. Obviously,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; these are not easy ideas to com=\r\nmunicate in vaikhari (external\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; communication). I pray to Maharshi V=\r\nasishtha to imbibe something\n&gt; more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; than vaikhari in the following =\r\nwords so that people can understand\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; better (not you Manish, the goa=\r\nl of answering your questions is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; obviously not to impart any knowle=\r\ndge to YOU, but to perhaps benefit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some others who may be ready - n=\r\now or in future).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The problem is not identification. =\r\nThe problem is *conditioning*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (likes, dislikes, wants, agendas etc)=\r\n that drives the identification\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and use of what one&#39;s ahamkara iden=\r\ntifies with. If ahamkara\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (identification) evaporates when chitta (c=\r\nonditioning) is cleaned\n&gt; up,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is normal mukti. If ahamkara (iden=\r\ntification) remains while\n&gt; chitta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (conditioning) is cleaned up, it=\r\n is jeevanmukti. It is as simple as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If =\r\none engages in an action with zero conditioning, then there is no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; k=\r\narma and there are no rinas created. Actions (physical or mental)\n&gt; by\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; themselves do not bind one - it is the *conditioned* actions that\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; bind one! It is the likes, dislikes, desires, agendas etc (i.e.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nconditioning in chitta) behind an action that bind one!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; If somebody who is not YET a jeevanmukta (but close) identified with\n&gt; a=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body and engaged in an action that IS driven by some conditioning,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; however subtle or pure or dharmik that conditioning may be (!), th=\r\nen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that sets in motion the law of kaarmik action-reaction which wil=\r\nl in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; due time give a particular reaction to what one identified wit=\r\nh when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engaging in that action.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the time the reaction is=\r\n experienced, all the conditioning may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; overcome and one may beco=\r\nme jeevanmukta. Yet, the momentum set in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; motion before one became j=\r\neevanmukta will continue to affect the\n&gt; body,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; senses and sensory m=\r\nind, i.e. whatever one&#39;s ahamkara is identifying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with. But, because=\r\n there is no conditioning and hence no agendas, no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desires, no like=\r\ns and dislikes, one neither rejoices nor protests\n&gt; nor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tries to mo=\r\ndify the happenings to what one is identifying with.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSensing that there is a pain requires no conditioning. It is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fu=\r\nnction of manas, i.e. Chandra. Observing that there is more pain\n&gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; the evening than morning (or when swallowing) requires no\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; condit=\r\nioning. It is the function of buddhi, i.e. Budha. But thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of p=\r\nraying to god to reduce pain requires conditioning in chitta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (absen=\r\nt in a jeevanmukta!).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though a jeevanmukta is identifying with a bo=\r\ndy, one does not view\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as something his own and something that =\r\nmust be kept in a particular\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; state. He identifies with it, but has =\r\nno agendas for it. All that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes from conditioning in chitta, whic=\r\nh is absent now!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The unconditioned identifier (liberated I-ness) vi=\r\news what one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identifies with as an *amalgam* of portions borrowed f=\r\nrom various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deities (pancha mahabhootas, Moon, Mercury, Indra, Mitr=\r\na, Varuna,\n&gt; Time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; etc) and hence as a manifestation of Light itself=\r\n. One does not view\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it from the prism of &quot;this is me, I need to use=\r\n it to pursue X or Y\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;this is me. I am mad=\r\ne of portions borrowed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from various deities, i.e. various manifesta=\r\ntions of Light. I\n&gt; observe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their play, i.e. what they do, and I ha=\r\nve no agenda pursue using\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is the essence of Upa=\r\nnishads and Yoga Vaasishtham, as well as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mantra Pushpam that we wer=\r\ne discussing a while back.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I repeat, identification is not the prob=\r\nlem. It is the conditioning\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that drives how one uses what one ident=\r\nifies with, that is the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; problem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I now feel l=\r\nike I have expressed myself better, though, given how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; subtle and nu=\r\nanced this knowledge is, some people may still get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused (if so,=\r\n please don&#39;t worry. Not a big deal. Just keep doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, for t=\r\nhat&#39;s the most important thing!). I am grateful to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manish and Mahar=\r\nshi Vasishtha for giving me this opportunity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, whether Ramakris=\r\nhna really got throat cancer because of his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;insult&quot; of Trilinga Sw=\r\nami or because he took the kaarmik power of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attorney from Girish (a=\r\n drunkard and womanizer at the time) can be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debated. Strictly speak=\r\ning, whether Ramakrishna really became a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; jeevanmukta in that lifeti=\r\nme or not can also be debated. But those\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not really useful de=\r\nbates.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Happy MahaShivaRatri again!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishnarpanamastu, Naras=\r\nimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------------------- Fre=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings, &quot;Do It\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fi=\r\nlms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://Saras=\r\nwatiFilms.org&gt; Spirituality:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wi=\r\nsdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&gt; Jyotish writings:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Sun, F=\r\neb 19, 2012 at 2:20 AM, Manish Pandit wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Shree Rama Dear Na=\r\nrasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That was not the question. The question was as I asked it.=\r\n Why did\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna get the affliction (my question presumes, that=\r\n he got it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; as a result of that insult) If his mind did not identify=\r\n with his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body, 24/7,But instead with Atma, then the karma would no=\r\nt have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; afflicted him, as there was no identification, so no karma (=\r\nlike\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna) If it did afflict that body, then it is obvious that =\r\nthere\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was good enough identification of mind with body, that he cou=\r\nld not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; escape the karmic result. That is the point. Not that he was=\r\n\n&gt; oblivious\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to the suffering. And, we say that he was a Jeevanmukt=\r\na. So how can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that happen, if according to that definition, the min=\r\nd must be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identifying 24/7 with Atma to be qualified as a Jeevanmuk=\r\nta?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The answer is straight forward. I await your reply.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kin=\r\ndest regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Sunday, February 19, 2012, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt; pvr@=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;javascript:parent.wgMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;pvr@&#39;)&gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste, As twitter is too restrictive a medium, I want to answer a\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; question that came up in an exchange between my guru Manish and me\n&gt;=\r\n on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Twitter, here. Some portions of the Twitter exchange are quote=\r\nd at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the end, in chronological order, in case someone is intereste=\r\nd in\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; background. I will answer the following question posed =\r\nby Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; based on my understanding: &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to my mind is=\r\n this: was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he suffer wit=\r\nh throat\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he was not identifying with his actions? (accor=\r\nding to\n&gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??)&gt;&gt;&gt; * =C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 * =C3=82 =C3=82\n&gt; =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 * Let me =\r\nelaborate on my understanding of jeevanmukti. Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; loosely (in m=\r\ny view) said in this exchange that rinas are of body\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a jeeva=\r\nnmukta continues to fulfil those rinas. But body is an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; insentient =\r\nobject. It has no rinas. The rinas are not of the body,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; but of the=\r\n mind that identifies with it. It is the antahkaranas of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mind - ah=\r\namkara (I-ness) and chitta (memory/conditioning) - that\n&gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the =\r\nsource of various rinas, particularly chitta. As mind\n&gt; identifies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n with a body, it projects its rinas on the body and makes the body\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with those\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rinas/cond=\r\nitioning. If the conditioning in chitta is completely\n&gt; wiped\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; out =\r\nand ahamkara merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditi=\r\noning in chitta is completely wiped out and yet ahamkara\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; continues=\r\n to exist with no limiting notions (it is basically the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioni=\r\nng in chitta that is limiting), then one becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta (libe=\r\nrated while living). Unlike in the case of one who\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; leaves body and=\r\n gets mukti, a jeevanmukta continues to have an\n&gt; I-ness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (but whic=\r\nh is not limited by any notions or conditioning). This\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; uncondition=\r\ned I-ness does project into a body. But it does not say\n&gt; &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; am th=\r\nis body and hence this body should be kept healthy or strong&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (THA=\r\nT would be conditioning in chitta, which is wiped out now!). On\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; th=\r\ne other hand, it does not either say &quot;this body should be ignored\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nand destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, body keeps\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; expe=\r\nriencing and doing things based on the *momentum* set in motion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; be=\r\nfore one became jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned\n&gt; experiences\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; and actions. This is like a fan turning for a while after the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; e=\r\nlectricity has been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep\n&gt; working\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as they did before. If one has throat cancer, indriyas may sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may process that input and\n&gt; register\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi may analyze various observations and draw various\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; conclusions (e.g. &quot;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurts\n&gt; eve=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels better&quot; et=\r\nc).\n&gt; A\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; normal person whose conditioned mind (chitta) says &quot;I shou=\r\nld\n&gt; overcome\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and not have this pain&quot; may think of various things =\r\nto do and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; struggle with them. But an unconditioned being has no su=\r\nch\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; considerations. Though one may feel and express the pain and ot=\r\nher\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objective experiences, one reacts to it differently. * =C3=82 =\r\n=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82\n&gt; * =C3=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 * This is a k=\r\ney point: Manas and buddhi are good at making\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objective observatio=\r\nns and rational deductions, but, by themselves,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; they do not have A=\r\nNY agenda. They neither like something nor\n&gt; dislike\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; something. TH=\r\nAT comes from the conditioning in chitta! The hallmark\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of a jeevan=\r\nmukta is that THAT is absent! * =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 * =C3=82 =C3=82=\r\n =C3=82\n&gt; =C3=82 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot=\r\n question. A better\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; way to express your question is: Can a jeevanm=\r\nukta get throat\n&gt; cancer\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? How is it possible if ther=\r\ne are no karmas or rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; left? I have already answered it. But, le=\r\nt me sum it up briefly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body, various body parts, jnanendriy=\r\nas, karmendiyas, manas\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi of a jeevanmukta continue to o=\r\nperate as before. One&#39;s I-ness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is intact and does project itself o=\r\nnto those. But neither I-ness\n&gt; nor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; those things carry any rinas o=\r\nr karmas. Chitta - the repository of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning and rinas - is c=\r\nlean. There are no limiting notions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body, indriyas, manas &=\r\n buddhi keep experiencing and doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things (good or bad!) based on=\r\n the previous momentum set by the\n&gt; play\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas and karmas while =\r\nsome conditioning was left in chitta.\n&gt; Body,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, =\r\nindriyas of jnana and karma and manas are all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed fr=\r\nom various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sentience into them =\r\nby projecting awareness into them. The\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta is w=\r\nhat drives how all these are viewed and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; used. Instead of looking a=\r\nt a sense organ as a portion of Indra or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views it as &quot;m=\r\ny so and so sense organ&quot;, due to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta. That is w=\r\nhat creates karmas and rinas. When\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that conditioning is *completel=\r\ny* overcome, ahamkara can still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; project awareness into those objec=\r\nts, but it sees them for what\n&gt; they\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are. It does not have false a=\r\nnd limiting notions like &quot;this throat\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel nice=\r\n and not feel painful&quot;. * =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 * =C3=82\n&gt; =C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 * Most people who may claim to be (or think they are)\n&gt;=\r\n jeevanmuktas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are not really jeevanmuktas in today&#39;s world. If one=\r\n wants to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; understand the state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham is=\r\n the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; book. The entire discourse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord=\r\n Rama is a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; detailed and elaborate definition and characterization =\r\nof a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. There may be other books that explain better how=\r\n to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; various sadhanas to progress spiritually and get closer to =\r\nbeing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; liberated oneday. But, when it comes elaborating what libera=\r\ntion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; while living actually is, there is none better than Yoga\n&gt; Va=\r\nasishtham.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one can say that this is merely an intellect=\r\nual exercise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are concerned. It perhaps is, as none =\r\nof may ever\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; become a jeevanmukta.. One word of caution: I write wi=\r\nth a very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; confident tone when I have strong conviction in what I w=\r\nrite. That\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; how I am. But I can definitely be wrong. So please=\r\n feel free to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ignore me! :-) Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to =\r\nall!

Nothing really, fulfilling all rnas, wait\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; rnas to be over. Narasimha: If a &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in &quot;fulfilling\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; all rnas&quot;, will he b bound again? If no, y r they called rnas? If\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; yes, y call him mukta? Manish: No, rnas will work out themselves,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; slowly or fast as may be the case. The rnas are of the body he or\n&gt; s=\r\nhe\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occupies. He is mukta because he experiences, actually sees the=\r\n\n&gt; rnas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to be the body&#39;s only. Rnas apply to the body, not to you.=\r\n You are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that &quot;speck of effulgent light&quot;, call it what you want, A=\r\ntma, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Well, that speck of effulgent light was never=\r\n bound. So,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; who exactly bcame &quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it have rnas?=\r\n If these\n&gt; &quot;rnas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of body&quot; r somehow not fulfilled after one bcome=\r\ns jeevanmukta, what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; happens to one? :-) Manish: You are right. The=\r\n mind thought, that,\n&gt; it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; was the body, instead of this light. Tha=\r\nt is the original problem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Which every being is born with. Rnas ar=\r\nise from this identification\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; which creates karma. U r not that, so=\r\n u r not bound, when the mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; realises this. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is als=\r\no not quite true, since u r\n&gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Light&quot; frm d beginning Narasim=\r\nha: Then, r the rnas of the &quot;body&quot;\n&gt; as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; u said r of the mind? When=\r\n a mind identifies with light & bcomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mukta, does it hv rnas left=\r\n? Manish: Ok, karmas projected into\n&gt; mind,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are acted on and may b=\r\ne experienced by body. So, why is a\n&gt; jeevanmukta\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; subject to this?=\r\n because, that person although aware of the light\n&gt; at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all times, =\r\nand of the causal n subtle bodies, has not yet directed\n&gt; d\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mind t=\r\no identify as that light at all times, key word being &quot;all&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; This =\r\ngives karmas time to work. Next stage is 24/7 id with light\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasi=\r\nmha: As per my understanding, the person u r defining is not\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; j=\r\neevanmukta. He may b an elevated being, but not mukta (liberated)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nyet. Manish: I derive that definition of this &quot;state&quot; from\n&gt; somebody,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; no problem in disagreement. 24/7 identification with light, most\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; likely body should not exist, no? Narasimha: Id with light forever\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with body dropping off is just mukti, not jivanmukti! Jivanmukti is\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; where body stays. Is body really different from light? In fact, is\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; there anything other than light? Jivanmukti is seeing the play of\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objects but seeing all as light. Mukti & rna are contradictory\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; concepts & cant coexist. U rnt &quot;free&quot; till u pay back what u owe.\n&gt; An=\r\nd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that means u dont owe anybody anything once u r truly free. Word=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; like free, liberated & jivanmukta r often misused. Manish: Will\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; explain a bit in detail sometime. Narasimha: OK. :-) But, as far a=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;explaining&quot; is concerned, Vasishtha explained as clearly &\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; elaborately as any human being can ever hope 2. Manish: The\n&gt; question=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to my mind is this: was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta?

An enlightened master ca=\r\nnnot be measured with definitions of mind and intellect bound by time and s=\r\npace. I personally liked the message from Sri.Narasimhaji on the fact that =\r\nwe=A0 cannot define these things with Vaikhari.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;A gyani(Jeevan Mu=\r\nkta) is beyond karmic bondage and uses gunas as tools in the interest of th=\r\ne world and does not accumulate new vasanas however he will indeed have pra=\r\nrabdha karma. Arrows that have left the bow cannot but strike the target th=\r\nough master can change velocity and trajectory.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;In once instance,=\r\n i heard of a story when Bhagwan Ramana or Paramacharya asked a devotee to =\r\nstay back in his ashram as an astrologer predicted a life threat to the dev=\r\notee. Let us note that Bhagwan has changed the destiny by cut and paste int=\r\no future lives of the devotee or taken over his karma. Very few masters out=\r\n of kindness do it.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;In the case Arjuna, let us note that he never=\r\n went to heaven during his last days and in fact fell off on his way to hea=\r\nven. Only Dharmaraja who is his eldest brother went to heaven finally as he=\r\n also accumulated certain karmas from his actions. Obviously Arjuna=A0 is n=\r\not jeevanmukta though he did have a purpose why he came down with Narayana =\r\nhimself.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Irrespective of Arjuna&#39;s prowess, after Lord Krishna=\r\n left his mortal body, Arjuna became like a ineffective warrior for sometim=\r\ne and had to pray to Lord to regain his prowess which means that without th=\r\ne touch of divine, we will screw up even normal nitya, naimittika karmas. M=\r\naya is powerful even with best faculties,&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&quot;Mahatma who live in=\r\n awareness and abiding in=A0 &quot;Self&quot; is a &quot;mukta&quot; is rel=\r\nieved of effects of Karma&quot; Karma is like a tool and the disease they h=\r\nandle in relation to their body is affect of minor residue of past karmas .=\r\nIt  is  said  that  when Bhisma was  lying  on his  bed  of  arrows,  he\n r=\r\nevealed before Lord Krisha that he has reviewed his previous 99 lives\n (an =\r\ninstance of  self  pastlife  regression)  but  could  not  find  \nrelevant =\r\n sanchit karma for  this  bed of the arrows. Then Vasudev, \nadvised him to =\r\nreview his 100 previous life. When Bheesm the Pitamah \nremembered  his 100 =\r\nlife  it became apparent  to him that  he was a  \nking in that life and whi=\r\nle traveling on  a horse, he found  a  snake  \nin his route, he picked up a=\r\nn arrow and threw the snake on nailed \nbushes. The snake was reborn as Arju=\r\nna in this life. Even Jivan Mukta is bound by laws of karma but being a gya=\r\nni is untouched by it and is in alignment with nature and never breaks laws=\r\n of karma.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Gahana karmano gatih&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;I remain at HER Feet=\r\n&lt;br&gt;Srikanth&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Tue, Mar 20, 2012 at 9:53 AM,=\r\n vvootla &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vvootla@...&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vvootla@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;blockquote class=\r\n=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0pt 0pt 0pt 0.8ex;border-left:1px solid rg=\r\nb(204,204,204);padding-left:1ex&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;u&gt;&lt;/u&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nNope. Arjun=\r\na was not a Jivan muktha or even vidEha muktha that life. One tradition sta=\r\ntes that Arjuna re-incarnated as Kannappa (Bhakta Kannappa) who becomes a d=\r\nevotee of Shiva (remember that in Mahabharat itself the seed for this was s=\r\nown in an episode that Arjuna and Shiva fight for a wild boar they hunted).=\r\n It is in that Kannappa life that he attains to mukti at srI kALahasti. In =\r\nKurukshetra war, Arjuna arrives at a certain state of unconditioned awarene=\r\nss or consciousness due to the dilemma and circumstances of the war and Kri=\r\nshna utilized that receptivity(arising out of utter helplessness and hence =\r\nwillingness to surrender) to give him glimpses of the Virat swarupam. You c=\r\nan liken the viswaroopam event to Ramakrishna making Narendra experience di=\r\nvinity by placing his feet on the chest. &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nI think Narasimha gAr=\r\nu&#39;s second post on jIvan mukta was relatively straight and clear on the=\r\n concept. The other points I&#39;ll add is that action done by tri-karanas =\r\ndo result in consequence(s) to the doer (as long as the action was done whi=\r\nle doer holds conditioned identity). All this accumulates in the sanchita (=\r\nwarehouse) of the doer and a portion of it gets allotted as prarabdha for a=\r\n given life. This prarabdha one has to experience whether they are liberate=\r\nd or not. Removal of conditioning does drop the entire Sanchita (breaks the=\r\n thread that is holding the Sanchita to the being) but prarabdha itself hol=\r\nds as this was already allotted and in itself is the primary cause for the =\r\nembodied life of that being. If you drop prarabdha you drop the body and he=\r\nnce life too. Because that karmic structure is what glues the jIva and the =\r\nsarIra. A jIvan mukta had dropped all conditioning and hence his bondages t=\r\no all sanchita is gone. No new bondage is established for newer actions (ag=\r\nAmi) because the actions now are not conditioned by any kind of ignorance(m=\r\nAya). These actions themselves can have consequences but they are not tied =\r\nto him and hence not attached/directed at him. They &#39;can&#39; even atta=\r\nck their prArabdha to alter it if neeeded, but as they had already become p=\r\nure witnesses than agenda driven conditioned individuals, they generally do=\r\nn&#39;t get into that and experience all of their prarabdha to let it burn =\r\nnaturally. They also have capabilities to create and accumulate &#39;consci=\r\nous and measured quantity and quality of sanchita&#39; to be available as p=\r\nrarabdha for a future life, if they intend to re-incarnate. However, whethe=\r\nr the &#39;veil of mAya&#39; was put consciously by oneself or was eternall=\r\ny present as we forgot that we put it ourselves, as long as the veil is on =\r\nus there will be an amount of conditioning and ignorance. The main differen=\r\nce is that just as a man who puts a veil on his face sees blurred but is fu=\r\nlly aware that he can anytime lift the veil at his own will to see through =\r\nclearly, a re-incarnated avatAra also knows that the veil of mAya was put o=\r\nn for a purpose and can be dropped once the purpose is served. The case of =\r\nrest of us is that of a man who put the veil a long time ago but totally fo=\r\nrgot about that i.e. a) that the veil exists and is interfering with his vi=\r\nsion and b) that the veil was put by himself and it is within his own contr=\r\nol to remove it. Hence we do all sadhana to recognize that distinction betw=\r\neen the veil and ourselves and thus drop the veil. &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\nRegards,&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n-Prasad&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt=\r\n;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaste - Well, I still don&#=\r\n39;t get it.

One&#39;s experiences and actions are due to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the mom=\r\nentum set in motion by previously present conditioning. One &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nengages in them with no agendas, likes, dislikes, and attachments. Thus, &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a jeevanmukta operates the previous identity till the momentum=\r\n comes to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; a screeching halt and then the body, senses, senso=\r\nry mind, buddhi etc &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; are returned to the original sources fro=\r\nm which they were borrowed and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; made sentient. But a jeevanmu=\r\nkta is free and unbound even while &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; operating with an identit=\r\ny, for binding comes from the conditioning and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; not from iden=\r\ntification or actions. When the identity dissolves, it is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; no=\r\nt any better or any extra freedom.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Most likely=\r\n, a jeevanmukta ceases to operate an identity after some &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; tim=\r\ne, that time depending on the strength of prior momentum! It can be &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; days or months or years or centuries or millennia.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Nature sets such powerful momentum in place for some beings (e=\r\n.g. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may operate an =\r\nidentity for a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; very long time after conditioning drops off c=\r\nompletely. It may even be &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; for the entire duration of Creatio=\r\nn. As a part of the momentum set in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; motion previously, one m=\r\nay even direct a part of one&#39;s ahamkara to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; identify with=\r\n a newly created identity (e.g. a new incarnation). But &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; this=\r\n is different from a normal reincarnation that happens after death. &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; Vishnu&#39;s incarnations are an example.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; Such a thing happens only with beings that have a special role to play =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; in the Play of Shakti.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Happy Ma=\r\nhaShivaRatri!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; On Sun, Feb 19, 2012 at 3:07 PM, krishna Kanth wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Pranamam,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sri Narasimha garu,&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I&#39;ve even got the similar question as Utpal=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; So is the state &#39;Mukta&#39; will mean th=\r\nat the person is no longer alive? &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, is the Jeevan Mukta&=\r\n#39;s will attain :Mukti&#39;?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I would assume =\r\nthe answer for Utpal&#39;s 2nd question would be that Jeevan &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Mukta&#39;s will continue to guide people in this world (carrying the will=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of god) to attain the appropriate states or atleast embark =\r\non the path.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subhamasthu&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; KK&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- On Sun, 2/19/12, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak=\r\n@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_path=\r\nak@&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Jeevanmukti (liberatio=\r\nn while living)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogro=\r\nups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; D=\r\nate: Sunday, February 19, 2012, 11:22 PM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;    Na=\r\nmaste,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have gone through both of your postin=\r\ngs thoroughly.

If ahamkara &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; (identification) evaporates when chitta (conditioning) is cleaned up, =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it is normal mukti. If ahamkara (identification) remain=\r\ns while chitta &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (conditioning) is cleaned up, it is jeev=\r\nanmukti.

Actions (physical or mental) by &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselve=\r\ns do not bind one - it is the  *conditioned* actions that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; bind one! It is the likes, dislikes, desires, agendas etc (i.e. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; conditioning in chitta) behind an action that bind one!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If somebody who is not Y=\r\nET a jeevanmukta (but close) identified with a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; body and=\r\n engaged in an action that IS driven by some conditioning, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; however subtle or pure or dharmik that conditioning may be (!), then &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that sets in motion the law of kaarmik action-reaction wh=\r\nich will in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; due time give a particular reaction to what=\r\n one identified with when &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; engaging in that action.&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; By the time the reaction is experienced, all the conditionin=\r\ng may be &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; overcome and one may become jeevanmukta. Yet, =\r\nthe momentum set in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; motion before one became jeevanmukt=\r\na will continue to affect the body, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; senses and sensory =\r\nmind, i.e. whatever one&#39;s ahamkara is identifying &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nith. But, because there is no conditioning and hence no agendas, no &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; desires, no likes and dislikes, one neither rejoices nor prote=\r\nsts nor &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; tries to modify the happenings to what one is i=\r\ndentifying with.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSensing that there is a pain requires no conditioning.

Observing that there is more pai=\r\nn in &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the evening than morning (or when swallowing) requ=\r\nires no &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conditioning. It is the function of buddhi, i.e=\r\n. Budha. But thinking &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of praying to god to reduce pain =\r\nrequires conditioning in chitta &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (absent in a jeevanmukt=\r\na!).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though a jeevanmukta is identifying with a body, on=\r\ne does not view it &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as something his own and something t=\r\nhat must be kept in a particular &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; state. He identifies w=\r\nith it, but has no agendas for it. All that &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; comes from =\r\nconditioning in chitta, which is absent now!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The uncondi=\r\ntioned identifier (liberated I-ness) views what one &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ide=\r\nntifies with as an *amalgam* of portions borrowed from various &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; deities (pancha mahabhootas, Moon, Mercury, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, T=\r\nime &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc) and hence as a manifestation of Light itself. =\r\nOne does not view &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it from the prism of &quot;this is me=\r\n, I need to use it to pursue X or Y &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; agenda.&quot; One v=\r\niews it as &quot;this is me.

I am grateful to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Manish and Maha=\r\nrshi Vasishtha for giving me this opportunity.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, whet=\r\nher Ramakrishna really got throat cancer because of his &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;insult&quot; of Trilinga Swami or because he took the kaarmik power =\r\nof &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; attorney from Girish (a drunkard and womanizer at th=\r\ne time) can be &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; debated. Strictly speaking, whether Rama=\r\nkrishna really became a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; jeevanmukta in that lifetime or=\r\n not can also be debated.

The question was as I asked it. Why did &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna get the affliction (my question presumes, tha=\r\nt he got it &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; as a result of that insult) If his mind did=\r\n not identify with his &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; body, 24/7,But instead with Atma=\r\n, then the karma would not have &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; afflicted him, as there=\r\n was no identification, so no karma (like &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna) If i=\r\nt did afflict that body, then it is obvious that there &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nwas good enough identification of mind with body, that he could not &lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; escape the karmic result. That is the point. Not that he was o=\r\nblivious &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to the suffering. And, we say that he was a Je=\r\nevanmukta. So how can &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; that happen, if according to that=\r\n definition, the mind must be &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; identifying 24/7 with Atm=\r\na to be qualified as a Jeevanmukta?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The answer is straig=\r\nht forward. I await your reply.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kindest regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; On Sunday, February 19, 2012, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt; pvr@ &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;javascript:parent.wgMail.openComposeWindow(&#39;pvr@&#39;=\r\n)&gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste, As twitter is too restric=\r\ntive a medium, I want to answer a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; question that cam=\r\ne up in an exchange between my guru Manish and me on &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt=\r\n; Twitter, here. Some portions of the Twitter exchange are quoted at &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the end, in chronological order, in case someone is inter=\r\nested in the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; background. I will answer the followin=\r\ng question posed by Manish &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; based on my understandin=\r\ng: &lt;&lt;&lt;The question to my mind is this: was &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he suffer with throat &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; cancer if he was not identifying with his actions? (according=\r\n to your &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definitio=\r\nn??)&gt;&gt;&gt; * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 * Let me elaborate on my understanding of je=\r\nevanmukti. Manish &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; loosely (in my view) said in this=\r\n exchange that rinas are of body and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; a jeevanmukta =\r\ncontinues to fulfil those rinas. But body is an &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ins=\r\nentient object. It has no rinas. The rinas are not of the body, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt;&gt; but of the mind that identifies with it. It is the antahkarana=\r\ns of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mind - ahamkara (I-ness) and chitta (memory/co=\r\nnditioning) - that are &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the source of various rinas,=\r\n particularly chitta. As mind identifies &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with a bod=\r\ny, it projects its rinas on the body and makes the body &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with t=\r\nhose &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rinas/conditioning. If the conditioning in chi=\r\ntta is completely wiped &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; out and ahamkara merges in =\r\nSelf, then it is mukti. But, if the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in=\r\n chitta is completely wiped out and yet ahamkara &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; co=\r\nntinues to exist with no limiting notions (it is basically the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitta that is limiting), then one becomes &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta (liberated while living). Unlike in the cas=\r\ne of one who &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; leaves body and gets mukti, a jeevanmu=\r\nkta continues to have an I-ness &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (but which is not l=\r\nimited by any notions or conditioning). This &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; uncond=\r\nitioned I-ness does project into a body. But it does not say &quot;I &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;&gt; am this body and hence this body should be kept healthy o=\r\nr strong&quot; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT would be conditioning in chitt=\r\na, which is wiped out now!). On &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the other hand, it =\r\ndoes not either say &quot;this body should be ignored &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&g=\r\nt; and destroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, body keeps &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing and doing things based on the *momentum* se=\r\nt in motion &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; before one became jeevanmukta and engag=\r\ned in conditioned experiences &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and actions. This is =\r\nlike a fan turning for a while after the &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; electricit=\r\ny has been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep working &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; as they did before. If one has throat cancer, indriyas may sense &lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (sensory/motor mind) may process that in=\r\nput and register &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi may analyze various o=\r\nbservations and draw various &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conclusions (e.g. &quo=\r\nt;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurts even &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n more&quot;, &quot;when I take so and so herbal liquid, it feels better&quo=\r\nt; etc). A &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; normal person whose conditioned mind (ch=\r\nitta) says &quot;I should overcome &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and not have thi=\r\ns pain&quot; may think of various things to do and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nstruggle with them. But an unconditioned being has no such &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt;&gt; considerations. Though one may feel and express the pain and other =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objective experiences, one reacts to it differently=\r\n. * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82 &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 =\r\n =C3=82  =C3=82 * This is a key point: Manas and buddhi are good at making =\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objective observations and rational deductions, but=\r\n, by themselves, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; they do not have ANY agenda. They =\r\nneither like something nor dislike &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; something. THAT =\r\ncomes from the conditioning in chitta! The hallmark &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is absent! * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 =\r\n* =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Whether Ramakris=\r\nhna was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A better &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nway to express your question is: Can a jeevanmukta get throat cancer &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and feel pain? How is it possible if there are no karmas =\r\nor rinas &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; left? I have already answered it. But, let=\r\n me sum it up briefly &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; again. Body, various body par=\r\nts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi of =\r\na jeevanmukta continue to operate as before. One&#39;s I-ness &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt;&gt; is intact and does project itself onto those. But neither I-ness=\r\n nor &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; those things carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta=\r\n - the repository of &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning and rinas - is cl=\r\nean. There are no limiting notions. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;s body,=\r\n indriyas, manas &amp; buddhi keep experiencing and doing &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt;&gt; things (good or bad!) based on the previous momentum set by the play=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of rnas and karmas while some conditioning was lef=\r\nt in chitta. Body, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; various body parts, indriyas of =\r\njnana and karma and manas are all &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; portions borrowed=\r\n from various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; se=\r\nntience into them by projecting awareness into them. The &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n;&gt; conditioning in chitta is what drives how all these are viewed and &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; used. Instead of looking at a sense organ as a portio=\r\nn of Indra or &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one views it as &quot;my so an=\r\nd so sense organ&quot;, due to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chit=\r\nta. That is what creates karmas and rinas. When &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tha=\r\nt conditioning is *completely* overcome, ahamkara can still &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; project awareness into those objects, but it sees them for what th=\r\ney &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are. It does not have false and limiting notions=\r\n like &quot;this throat is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel nice =\r\nand not feel painful&quot;. * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82  =C3=\r\n=82  =C3=82 &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 * Most people who may claim to b=\r\ne (or think they are) jeevanmuktas &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are not really j=\r\neevanmuktas in today&#39;s world. If one wants to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; u=\r\nnderstand the state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham is the best &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; book. The entire discourse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lord Rama=\r\n is a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; detailed and elaborate definition and charact=\r\nerization of a &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. There may be other book=\r\ns that explain better how to do &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; various sadhanas to=\r\n progress spiritually and get closer to being &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; liber=\r\nated oneday. But, when it comes elaborating what liberation &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; while living actually is, there is none better than Yoga Vaasishth=\r\nam. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one can say that this is merely an i=\r\nntellectual exercise &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are concerned. =\r\nIt perhaps is, as none of may ever &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; become a jeevanm=\r\nukta.. One word of caution: I write with a very &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; con=\r\nfident tone when I have strong conviction in what I write. That is &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt;&gt; how I am. But I can definitely be wrong. So please feel fre=\r\ne to &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ignore me! :-) Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow nigh=\r\nt) to all!
