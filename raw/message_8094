O=\r\nne day Swamiji met this man in the street and they were talking about this =\r\ndispute. This man said, I am a true Muslim and I have plenty of money and I=\r\n could go to another town easily.

In India, we kept the mature coconut in a dry place... over the time(3 t=\r\no 6 months) the outside skin of the coconut becomes dry...\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.

HOWEVER, my question is - how to I dry a &quot;FULL&quot; coconut so much=\r\n that it becomes BURNABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am drying sliced coconut=\r\ns... but if I keep a full coconut somewhere for a few days, will not it be =\r\nrotten or something? Any procedure? I am \n&gt; &gt; asking this because here no o=\r\nne has any idea about that, because no one \n&gt; &gt; even thinks of having &quot;burn=\r\nable&quot; full coconuts. That is why.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My two cents :\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To make=\r\n dry coconut you need heat more than the sunlight. Yes the coconut will rot=\r\n if you keep it outside in the sun for so long. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I long back =\r\nsaw in Food TV in US.....he kept the whole coconut in conventional oven for=\r\n one hour. Then he broke the shell with a hammer. The shell came out easily=\r\n and the whole coconut stayed intact. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I think once the shell=\r\n comes out put the whole coconut in oven again, that way the water will dry=\r\n out and you will get a dry coconut.=C2=A0 You can shake the coconut to see=\r\n if there is water inside or not and accordingly experiment. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Hope this works...good luck with your homams.

I thank you f=\r\nor guiding me so detailed... without your manual it would never be possible=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Interesting point to note, that in Dec of 2005 I visited India a=\r\nnd stayed with a Brahmin family for about 10 days and the ONLY PURPOSE of m=\r\ny visit was to learn doing homam! However I was disappoint because their pr=\r\nocedure was so big that it would take about 3 hours for the homam, and many=\r\n more materials also. Of course, they learnt it from &#39;guru-kulam&#39; and it wa=\r\ns their own tradition. They are not a modern researcher like you [Narasimha=\r\nJi] who could compare many traditions, research on them, and even come up w=\r\nith a shorter version. They had no idea that a shorter version is possible,=\r\n or something can be left out. As an example, they suggested a mantadoryjap=\r\nam of 10x times before I do an &#39;x&#39; times offering in homam, and many more f=\r\normalities.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So, I knew in Bangladesh I would never have so much ma=\r\nterials needed, and I would not be able to perform a 3 hour homam regularly=\r\n, so it was of no use. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Much later when I was reading your manual,=\r\n I remember about Achamanan, Raksha etc. from their teaching :-)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A=\r\nnyway Ji...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Everything was almost as per recommendation, except I =\r\nused a melamine spoon to offer ghee, because I couldn&#39;t manage a wooden spo=\r\non even after a lot of effort. May be I have to order it... but I will have=\r\n to work much hard to find a craft-man who can make a spoon with wood.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; I burnt the fire with mango-wood and jute-sticks.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Purnahuti w=\r\nith ghee only.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That WAS the problem. Soon after starting the fire,=\r\n I had an idea how fast the woods were burning. So while I was moving with =\r\nthe homam, I knew that with a big stream of ghee as a purnahuti, the fire w=\r\nill not survive long to allow me meditate even 5 mins. Because the woods we=\r\nre burning out fast.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; So I could not meditate.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My first Q.=\r\n - 1) Would you have any suggestion how can I make the fire last long so th=\r\nat it burns for at least 10 mins allowing me mediate? I noted even if I had=\r\n put much wood, they would still burn out fast...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Offering full / =\r\nhalf coconut seems to be the only thing that would keep the fire alive for =\r\n10-15 mins and let me meditate.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Another Q. - 2) I have sliced coco=\r\nnut copras and drying them for last 3-4 days, I can dry them no matter how =\r\nlong it takes, so that I can use them as suggested in the manual. HOWEVER, =\r\nmy question is - how to I dry a &quot;FULL&quot; coconut so much that it becomes BURN=\r\nABLE for purnahuti? I mean, I am drying sliced coconuts... but if I keep a =\r\nfull coconut somewhere for a few days, will not it be rotten or something? =\r\nAny procedure? I am asking this because here no one has any idea about that=\r\n, because no one even thinks of having &quot;burnable&quot; full coconuts. That is wh=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mantras work very strong for me. But I feel not strong enough f=\r\nor big spiritual or material effects. I have had very strong experiences wi=\r\nth homam before while performing with others. Even a few times I *arranged*=\r\n homams for others and I always directly felt a strong effect working on me=\r\n also.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Today with the homam, the effect was not that strong. I kno=\r\nw why, because it was a super-short homam, with many mantras left. Also, I =\r\nshould honestly admit that when I imagined Lord Ganesha and Lord Shani Deva=\r\n in the fire, the imagination was not 100% strong. Because, I was worried a=\r\nnd nervous about making mistake, so I could not 100% focus on their presenc=\r\ne. Which I should. I guess it will improve with time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am going t=\r\no add mantras from the main homam soon, common mantras which are needed in =\r\nall homams like Anugya, KalashaSuddhi, Agni Deva prayer etc. Also I guess A=\r\nvahana-related Sanskrit mantras are very important.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; By the way I d=\r\nid 108 offerings with Veda-Vyasa Shani mantra and then 21 offerings with th=\r\ne smallest Shani mantra again.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am thankful to the ultimate divin=\r\nity that at least I didn&#39;t have any negative experience after the homam. I =\r\nwas pretty nervous about the possibility. Because long back in 2002-2003 wh=\r\nen I started mantras, almost everyday I faced negative energies for the imp=\r\nerfection of pronunciation and procedures. Sometimes the negatives were so =\r\nstrong. But I didn&#39;t give up and tried to understand the correct ways becau=\r\nse since I saw the power in it, I had to find what&#39;s the right way to get t=\r\nhe pure blessings, avoiding mistakes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As an example, you [Narasimh=\r\naJi] instructed to stay in an empty stomach while doing homam. I find this =\r\n100% true from my mantra japam experience. Though no website or almost no o=\r\nne instructed me to stay empty stomached in japam, I found that mantras wor=\r\nk very strong with empty stomach. Also, I always got strong negative effect=\r\ns when I did japam after my dinner. Thus, I learned this from my own experi=\r\nence but after a lot of troubles faced [for the wrong practices I did]! Now=\r\n days, I can&#39;t eat anything after my lunch... because I do mantras in the e=\r\nvening. At times it becomes very difficult not to eat something as I someti=\r\nmes hang out with friends etc. at afternoon or early evening. But I have no=\r\n choice.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is the thing I appreciate about you [NarasimhaJi] to=\r\n make the small [yet very important] things always mentioned.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Same=\r\n thing about your instruction of minimum movement of the body, I find it ve=\r\nry correct.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway Ji I guess I am stretching my mail very long...=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; my 3rd Q. - 3) As per your manual if I take Shani as an expressio=\r\nn of the ultimate cosmic power or divinity, I can offer other Gods&#39; mantras=\r\n in fire too. Can I do a Navagrahahomam this way, or at least a homam for 6=\r\n-7 grahas?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) If yes, should I maintain the graha order such as Su=\r\nrya, Chandra, Kuja and so on?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5) Is there any exceptional instruct=\r\nion while doing homam of Rahu and Ketu etc., or just like Shani?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; W=\r\nanted to mention that I am also planning to do homam of Maha Lakshmi and ot=\r\nher deities but manuals for those deities are already there, hence these ad=\r\nditional questions about graha-homams.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Appreciate your time to ans=\r\nwer me.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thanking you again,\n&gt; &gt; Tanvir\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
