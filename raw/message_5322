Is it ok to do puja of Kuladaivata idols which have lost features due =\r\nto decades of pooja? not broken etc. but features like eyes, nose etc. are =\r\nno longer discernible.\nVijay: Idols serve two main objectives.\n1. Help the =\r\nsadhaka concentrate/focus. Since the sadhaka feels he/she is sitting in fro=\r\nnt of idol of so and so devi/devata there is better focus. Is we get a call=\r\n and some says, it is from prime minister, wont the attention change?\n2. De=\r\npending on the level of sadhana, the idol, seat, mala etc. Accumulate some =\r\nenergy which could help some in your next generations.\nGod has no form as s=\r\nuch. So, a deformation does not matter to the God. It is all in our minds, =\r\nthere is no issue unless you imagine one. Remove the element of doubt and g=\r\nuilt and go ahead using the idols. Remember the way, Ramakrishanji used a b=\r\nroken idol of  Krishna at Dakshineswar!\n&gt; 2. Is it ok if one form of the go=\r\nd is mistaken for another unknowingly... specifically Narsimha and Pralhad =\r\nwith Narsimha and Laxmi devi? Esp. if Tulja Bhavani is said to be Kuladevi?=\r\n\nvijay: firstly, when you do some thing unknowingly, you don&#39;t get any papa=\r\nm. However, it is different when you know that you are doing some thing unk=\r\nowingly.\nI personally use the same idol to invoke multiple devatas and I DO=\r\n NOT FEEL GUILT. My advice is to find from elder what the idols are and the=\r\nn trust them and get going.\n&gt; 3. Addition of gods in puja over generations =\r\n- as each one will have a istha or priya deva/ devi?\nVijay: God is like mot=\r\nher and far better mother than any mother we see. God does not need us to p=\r\nray him. We are praying him out of our own (spiritual or material) needs. Y=\r\nou pray to the form of the God you associate yourself with. You donot have =\r\nto pray to all forms of idols just because they are added to your puja room=\r\n through generations. Towards the end of puja, you can say, sarva devatabho=\r\nm namaha.\n\n\n"}}
