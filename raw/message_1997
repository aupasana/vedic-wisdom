I am posting it here for anyone interested.\n=C2=A0\nNear the beginning =\r\nof the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aur=\r\nobindo, began to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In hi=\r\ns high states of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage=\r\n in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right =\r\nhere on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life w=\r\nas now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a=\r\n breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body to=\r\nwards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n=EF=BF=BD\nSri Aurobindo was joined in=\r\n Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became kn=\r\nown as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive cellula=\r\nr transformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties we fac=\r\ne today.\n=EF=BF=BD\nSri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all ma=\r\ntter, and that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The proce=\r\nss of the divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution. T=\r\nhe process by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called=\r\n evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where =\r\nthese two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he=\r\n foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=\r\n=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely c=\r\nhange everything on Earth.\n=EF=BF=BD\nMan=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what=\r\n he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immortal soul=\r\n is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people, while an et=\r\nernal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by the hard l=\r\nid of his constructed personality. There is a great divine plan in motion, =\r\neven if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.\n\nSri Aurob=\r\nindo recognized that humankind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A s=\r\ntage has been reached in which the human mind has made tremendous strides o=\r\nn the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinc=\r\ntion as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before her death in 1=\r\n973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind, what may be terme=\r\nd the Supermind, has recently been established in the fields of the Earth, =\r\nand is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into cellular conscio=\r\nusness.\n\nEvolution took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and =\r\nlater with the emergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another le=\r\nap forward, even more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Sup=\r\nermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we=\r\n will soon be starting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =\r\n=EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being posse=\r\nssing an individualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and me=\r\nrging with it.\n=EF=BF=BD\nNext is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a speci=\r\nes that is spontaneous-ly coming to birth under the influence of an ever-ex=\r\npanding supramental field, a being that is largely able to merge and live f=\r\nrom soul-consciousness rather than mind-consciousness. \n=C2=A0\nThirdly is t=\r\nhe =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body,=\r\n but will be in possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consc=\r\niousness that has begun to merge with cellular consciousness. \n=C2=A0\nFinal=\r\nly, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=\r\n=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matter. This will=\r\n be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In th=\r\nis species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon Ear=\r\nth.\n\nThe great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing suprame=\r\nntal consciousness down into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies=\r\n. Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant that the supramental co=\r\nnsciousness was simultaneously being brought into the consciousness fields =\r\nof the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower into its full manife=\r\nstation in collective matter.\nWhenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD=\r\n there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of t=\r\nheir experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-di=\r\nvine forces, at work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, th=\r\ne Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These=\r\n are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in con=\r\ntrol of current global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Luc=\r\nifer?) has gone through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Sufferi=\r\nng has returned to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak=\r\n havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=\r\n=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own=\r\n intensive inner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficul=\r\nt to see how this same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the =\r\ncurrent political sphere.\n\nWith the descent of this new vibratory conscious=\r\nness all our old obsolete human structures will be demolished. However, Sri=\r\n Aurobindo emphasized that although the changes will be enormous they would=\r\n not be necessarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automatically erases F=\r\nalsehood, and our world for the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the S=\r\nupramental, he maintained, carried a power of harmonization which could ove=\r\nrcome this resistance by means other than dramatic struggle and violence. T=\r\nhe Asuras will eventually be absorbed into their original emanations of Lig=\r\nht, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may be interesting to speculate, with all t=\r\nhe violence in the world today, the destruction we might have experienced i=\r\nf not for this power of harmonization!\n\nWhen does all this happen? Sri Auro=\r\nbindo and the Mother believed that the world stage was set for this quantum=\r\n descent, and that it was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the =\r\nsupramental transformation was a certainty now, and that it would come abou=\r\nt with a minimum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still co=\r\nnsiderable.=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nThis was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji=\r\n says about changes coming in the world.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\n=\r\n\nThe upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n\n\n\n\n      ICC Wor=\r\nld Twenty20 England &#39;09 exclusively on YAHOO!
