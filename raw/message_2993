As I said before, anybody who wishes to formally have a guru figure in the mind for this procedure may think of me as the guru for this procedure, without asking specifically.\n \nMy permission is always there, but I am nobody to give blessings.\n \n2. Yes, that would be alright. South-west is considered a good place for Ganapathi specifically.\n \n3. Krishna needs to do nothing, but he does everything.\n \nKrishna is the supreme cosmic being. He is the sum total of all beings. All the worlds and beings of this universe rest inside him. He sees, hears, eats, wishes, knows and acts through all beings of this universe.\n \nThe notion &quot;I am doing it&quot; causes pride and increases attachment to the result. The notion &quot;god is doing through me&quot; increases devotion and detachment to the result. In all rituals, they say krishnaarpanamastu at the end, as it is conducive to thoughts like &quot;god is doing through me and I am a mere instrument&quot;.\n \n4. Agni and other deities will be more offended by a proud person with good pronunciation who thinks &quot;what a nice and competent ritual I am doing right now and how good my pronunciation is!&quot; A person having humility and devotion but pronouncing weakly is in a much better position. \n \nOne more thing.. Pronunciation can be improved easily. But humility and devotion cannot be improved that easily. It takes a much longer time.\n \nSo keep up your humility and devotion and slowly try to improve the pronunciation.\n \nAll the best with homam!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- &quot;Om.NamoNarayanaya&quot; &lt;om.namonarayanaya@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Narasimha Guruji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Thank you for your MahaGanapati homam procedure document.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would really appreciate if you could kindly help answer these  \n&gt; queries:-\n&gt; \n&gt; 1.\tI realised while performing the homam for the first time today,  \n&gt; that I have yet to obtain your permission and blessings to name you as  \n&gt; my guru. I would really\n&gt; \tappreciate if you could kindly grant me your permission and blessings.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.\tYou mentioned that the Ganapati idol has to be placed on the East  \n&gt; side of the homam kundam. I also noticed the same in your video.\n&gt; \tMy homam kundam is slightly bigger at 15 inches square. Thus if I  \n&gt; place the idol on the East side, I find it difficult to offer the  \n&gt; items during the pooja.\n&gt; \tIs it aright to place the idol nearer, i.e. on the South-West or  \n&gt; North-West corner so that it is easily accessible?\n&gt; \n&gt; 3.\tWhat is the significance of offering the doership of the homam to  \n&gt; Lord Krishna at the end?\n&gt; \tThe homam was offered with the intention of spiritual cleansing and  \n&gt; upliftment. I am sure Lord Krishna does not require spiritual  \n&gt; cleansing and upliftment.\n&gt; \tSo what then is the significance of offering the doership to Lord  \n&gt; Krishna?\n&gt; \n&gt; 4.\tMy knowledge of Sanskrit is very basic and thus my pronunciation  \n&gt; requires my improvement. I am really worried that my pronunciation of  \n&gt; the mantras may be wrong\n&gt; \tin many places. While I try my best to listen to your video and  \n&gt; learn, I realise that this is a long process.\n&gt; \n&gt; \tI do realise  that you had provided a very short procedure requiring  \n&gt; very little mantras. However I find that my knowledge  is somewhere in  \n&gt; between your 2 procedures.\n&gt; \t\n&gt; \tWould I be committing any grave mistakes and thus offending the  \n&gt; deities and Agni?\n&gt; \t\n&gt; Thank you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Om Shanti Shanti Shanti\n&gt; \n&gt; Warmest Regards,\n&gt; Narayanan\n\n\n"}}
