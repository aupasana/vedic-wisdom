&gt;  ha=\r\nve been doing Ganapati homam for quite a long time and now he is doing Chan=\r\ndi homam.. showed me how to do it ,,and there again i met another friend of=\r\n mine who is regular in doing Chandi homams who inspired me to start as wel=\r\nl... i was very tensed to start off as i didnt had even that much of money =\r\nto start off regularly.. and there again i was a bit tensed about how my pa=\r\nrents would react to the things like .. i am turning out to be a veg and wi=\r\nll be doing homams on a regular basis.. where as my income was nil at that =\r\ntime .. !!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; now comes the suprises as follows:-\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Manish =\r\nji=A0 called up my friend who was staying in my home ,who was staying in my=\r\n home .. after we had returned .. from Venaras..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) I was so happy=\r\n and excited about the fact that without even knowing .. how .. i just took=\r\n the decision .. that i am going to start ..my Homams DAILY.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) To=\r\n my=A0 very surprise.. my parents did not objected, to my decision of doing=\r\n Homams on a regular basis.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) The very 1st day i did my homam.. i=\r\n got a call for regular work.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 5) By profession i am an Actor / Anc=\r\nhor .. so i dont have any permanent salaried job..it implies of a inconsist=\r\nent income .. now .. i get calls for a lot works regularly .. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 6) =\r\nMy mom started to recite Chandi ..path regularly and the biggest of all sup=\r\nrises.. my Dad who never was so much into spirituality is starting Saptashl=\r\noki Chandi path .,,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 7) In total.. i got very fast results ..of my =\r\nhomams..and was lucky and blessed enough to help two others to start Ganapa=\r\nti homams regularly ..all the problems that i have been facing for a long t=\r\nime .. does not exists right now .. at all... \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Right now .. i am p=\r\nreparing . for Chandi homam.. and trying to my best of possibilities.. to r=\r\nead the 13 chapters of Chandi fluently ..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; now i have a question to=\r\n my respected seniors...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) i am happy that my monetary problem ..=\r\n is solving very fast .. but in no way i was, nor am i now .. attached to t=\r\nhe mundane.. and earthly materialistic desires...so i am a bit confused.. t=\r\nhat getting earthly benefits ..without even asking for it.. in the homam.. =\r\nhope is not a way or a procedure.. to deviate me .. from.. the sadhana.. i =\r\nmean getting very fast results from .. the homam.. is it a way God is testi=\r\nng me ????\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) plz do correct me ,.., if at any place .. i am wrong=\r\n and incorrect ,., \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; i beg of mercy .. if i have said anything wron=\r\ng .. i dont know much . and just a beginner.. its just my devotion and fait=\r\nh are all that i have.. while doing my homams..and i am sure .. i do a plen=\r\nty of mistakes in my steps.. while doing the homam..but i am thankful that =\r\nGod has been merciful enough to forgive me and bless...i am enjoying my sta=\r\nte of bliss..and after a very long search .. i think this is=A0 the right w=\r\nay meant for ..me .. my life has changed..and i hope it will be the same or=\r\n even more.. for the new friends who are yet to come.. i did three homams a=\r\nt a stretch today for the 1st time and i am happy for that fact very much ,=\r\n, \n&gt; &gt; Despite of the factor. that i havent been lucky enough . to meet or =\r\neven to interact with =A0 Manish ji ..=A0 i think of him as my Guru .. and =\r\ni feel blessed at all times..\n&gt; &gt; and a special thanks to Rajarshi da and A=\r\nrnab ,, \n&gt;
