If you understand that all=\r\n approaches are valid and\n&gt; follow the approach your mind is inclined in, i=\r\nt is a sattwik approach.\n&gt;\n&gt; (1) Well, you neither promote begging by helpi=\r\nng someone, nor do you\n&gt; eradicate begging by ignoring someone. Instead of =\r\nlooking at the system,\n&gt; look at the individuals you encounter. If you can =\r\nhelp someone and get an\n&gt; instinct to help someone, do it.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the end o=\r\nf the day, there is no universal right and wrong in any matter.\n&gt; In Mahabh=\r\narata, Bhishma teaches that dharma comes from one&#39;s heart. The\n&gt; conscience=\r\n of a person is pure and shows dharma clearly. But, when the\n&gt; instinct com=\r\ning from conscience passes through the conditioned mind, it may\n&gt; become mo=\r\ndified by the conditioning of the mind. If one is following the\n&gt; conscienc=\r\ne, engaging in actions with surrender and giving up doership to god\n&gt; at th=\r\ne end, slowly conditioning is removed and conscience will shine\n&gt; brighter =\r\nthrough one&#39;s actions.\n&gt;\n&gt; (2) Yes, such money-minded people are there in e=\r\nvery profession, even in\n&gt; noble professions such as priests, Jyotishis, te=\r\nachers of scriptures,\n&gt; spiritual leaders etc. But why should we judge othe=\r\nrs? Why not focus the\n&gt; rational mind instead on oneself and judge one&#39;s ow=\r\nn shortcomings?\n&gt;\n&gt; (3) Mind is highly conditioned by duality and responds =\r\nto symbols. For\n&gt; example, one may say or even think that all material thin=\r\ngs are an illusion\n&gt; and temporary. One may say or even think that beauty a=\r\nnd ugliness are\n&gt; illusive and temporary and death catches up with everythi=\r\nng. But, can one\n&gt; control one&#39;s mind when encountering a beautiful person =\r\nof opposite sex\n&gt; without clothes? Can one control one&#39;s mind when someone =\r\nabuses one badly or\n&gt; priases one to the skies?\n&gt;\n&gt; Theory is different and=\r\n control over mind practically is different. To\n&gt; train the mind, we use ma=\r\nny symbols. For example, one may see men and women\n&gt; burning on funeral pyr=\r\nes and the image may stick to one&#39;s mind. When one\n&gt; sees a beautiful perso=\r\nn, one may recall those images and mind may think\n&gt; about the impermanence =\r\nof body. Symbols encountered in various religions\n&gt; offer ways for the mind=\r\n to distract from negative thoughts and train in\n&gt; thoughts promiting spiri=\r\ntual progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; (4) Some aghoris, some priests, some jyotishis and some =\r\nspiritual leaders\n&gt; may be running after money or fame without realizing th=\r\neir impermanence.\n&gt; That is not surprising. But why should we bother about =\r\nothers? Why not focus\n&gt; on ourselves?\n&gt;\n&gt; Secondly, someone merely acceptin=\r\ng money may or may not be attached to\n&gt; money. A realized man does not run =\r\nafter or run away from anything. One\n&gt; cannot judge a person accurately fro=\r\nm one&#39;s actions. One&#39;s intentions and\n&gt; attitude cannot be confidently judg=\r\ned from one&#39;s actions.\n&gt;\n&gt; (5) NEVER be jealous of anybody. Everyone has on=\r\ne&#39;s own samskaras and one&#39;s\n&gt; own rinas and gets results accordingly.\n&gt;\n&gt; (=\r\n6) Difficult. If you are a little less angry in situations where you\n&gt; norm=\r\nally experience anger, if you are a little less jealous where you\n&gt; normall=\r\ny feel jealosy, if you are a little less attracted to material things\n&gt; tha=\r\nt normally pull you towards them, if you are a little less proud in\n&gt; situa=\r\ntions where you normally experience pride, if you are a little less\n&gt; depre=\r\nssed in situations where you normally experience depression, and if you\n&gt; a=\r\nre able to think of god now and then as the doer of all actions with some\n&gt;=\r\n sense of surrender, I can say you are making some progress.\n&gt;\n&gt; The prgres=\r\ns is not linear. One may make very slow progress for a while and\n&gt; make goo=\r\nd progress in short duration, then slowdown again, then accelerate\n&gt; again =\r\nand so on. Keep doing sadhana and it will not go waste.\n&gt;\n&gt; (7) The divine =\r\nbliss does not come from elsewhere. It is already there. It\n&gt; is your own l=\r\nikes, dislikes, anger, jealosy, shame, pride etc that block it,\n&gt; like blac=\r\nk paint on a lampshade blocking the light of the lamp. To taste it,\n&gt; you h=\r\nave to overcome those internal enemies and surrender more completely\n&gt; and =\r\nunconditionally to god. &quot;I will surrender to you and accept whatever you\n&gt; =\r\ngive.

B&#39;coz in these&lt;br&gt;&gt; places there ar=\r\ne many babas who do nothing.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 2)moreover seeing the priests=\r\n over there, irritated me coz&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; they were also running after money, =\r\nmaking people fool in&lt;br&gt;&gt; the name of doing rudrabhishek or other thing=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 3)Though the bhasmarti at mahaakal(ujjain) was marvelou=\r\ns,&lt;br&gt;&gt; but it kept reminding me of the fact that why a deity who is&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; TIME ,DEATH personified is being decorated in such a&lt;br&gt;&gt; manner?&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 4)When the arti was done there, probably an aghori came&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; with &quot;bhasm&quot;.Though he tried avoiding being touched by&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; others, i wished to touch him(after studying AGHORA and&lt;br&gt;&gt; being =\r\ninspired by vimalanan) and ask him a few things, but&lt;br&gt;&gt; unfortunately =\r\ncouldn&#39;t.&lt;br&gt;&gt; But to my astonishment, he went and sat outside the t=\r\nemple&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; and kept collecting money whatever people gave, who came to&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; visit/see him out of curiosty. Now what shaal i consider,&lt;br&gt;&gt; e=\r\nven aghoris are not out of web of maaya?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 5) i donot know w=\r\nhether i am jealous or envious of&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Rajrishi, that he got=A0 a chanc=\r\ne to spend time with&lt;br&gt;&gt; somebody who has reached NVKS.Even when the aa=\r\nrti was going&lt;br&gt;&gt; on i kept on repeting Ganesh&#39;s name.Did i do some=\r\nthing&lt;br&gt;&gt; wrong?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 6)i have been doing ganpati homam for=\r\n few months.But i do&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; not know whether i done any spiritual progres=\r\ns.How do you&lt;br&gt;&gt; figure it out?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; 7)Somewhere you have w=\r\nritten in your mails, that once u get&lt;br&gt;&gt; a taste of divine bliss, you&=\r\n#39;ll try to immerse in it.How can&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; i tatste it as soon as possibl=\r\ne?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Please reply on mail or on forum, as you wish.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; Regards&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;MIN-HEIGHT: 0px; COLOR: #f=\r\nff&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--00504502f681459ba2047d55290b--\r\n\n"}}
