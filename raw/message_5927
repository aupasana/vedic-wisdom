Since it is relevan=\r\nt to the topic, wish to add my 2 cent...\n\n&quot;Sopari&quot; (Betel Nut) is one good =\r\nitem to offer as a Purnaahuti. Especially for those, who are doing homam in=\r\n close apartment with dry coconut pieces. Somebody suggested me to offer it=\r\n in Homam long back and since then I usually offer it every time along with=\r\n a Dry Coconut Half. I did not realize initially the purport of the suggest=\r\nion but after more than a year of offering, i understood the meaning. Sopar=\r\ni is an extremely hard substance-Very difficult to break. Symbolical of our=\r\n false Ego and Pride. our patterns & Habits. However one caution! If one st=\r\narts offering it as purnaahuti then one may need to be ready to face situat=\r\nions where in Ego is hurt, Insults are mounted, feathers are ruffled. One m=\r\nay be tested badly so that ultimately pride for anything is crushed.\n\nRegar=\r\nds,\n\nUtpal \n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@=\r\n...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; Depending on the materials offered in homam, =\r\nthe effect on one&#39;s subtle \n&gt; consciousness changes. One of the nice substa=\r\nnces that one can offer in \n&gt; homam fire is a whole fresh coconut. Though d=\r\nry coconut (copra) can also \n&gt; be offered, normal fresh whole coconut with =\r\nwater in it is a fantastic \n&gt; material. Traditionally this is what was offe=\r\nred as poornaahuti \n&gt; (symbolic of head, i.e. ego).\n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, those who do =\r\nhomam with a small fire using dry coconut pieces \n&gt; should ignore this mail=\r\n completely. Offering a whole fresh coconut in \n&gt; fire is practical only fo=\r\nr those who do homam with a big fire using logs \n&gt; of wood. You want to off=\r\ner something only if you can fully burn it.\n&gt; \n&gt; If a fresh coconut is offe=\r\nred in fire, it will take a while to burn \n&gt; completely, because it has lay=\r\ners (fiber, shell, white stuff and water \n&gt; etc, just like our own ego-cons=\r\nciousness!). If one offers it in the end \n&gt; of homam, it will be a challeng=\r\ne to make it burn fully.\n&gt; \n&gt; One idea is to offer it in the beginning inst=\r\nead of the end, and give it \n&gt; time to burn, as one goes through homam. I, =\r\nfor example, offer a fresh \n&gt; coconut in my daily homam at the end of offer=\r\nings to Ganapathi at the \n&gt; beginning of homam. Then I invoke Chandi and of=\r\nfer Chandipath in fire \n&gt; with various offerings. During the course, the fr=\r\nesh coconut burns fully \n&gt; and gets reduced to ashes by the end. Having off=\r\nered a whole fresh \n&gt; coconut in homam daily for six months, I can tell you=\r\n that it is a very \n&gt; good idea (if and only if it is practical in your cas=\r\ne).\n&gt; \n&gt; One risk is that coconut can break in a spot and hot water can gus=\r\nh at \n&gt; you at a speed. Though that can be avoided with a little understand=\r\ning \n&gt; of the dynamics, one should not do this if one is worried about the =\r\n\n&gt; inhury.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short H=\r\nomam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Sp=\r\nirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writing=\r\ns: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Tw=\r\nitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
