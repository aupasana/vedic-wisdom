Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; I cannot point =\r\nto any audio that I found satisfactory.\n&gt;\n&gt; Please buy the book &quot;Mantrapush=\r\npam&quot; by Ramakrishna Mutt. It gives\nGayatri\n&gt; mantra with intonation marked =\r\ncorrectly. It has many other veda\nmantras too.\n&gt;\n&gt; I will point out a few s=\r\ntandard mistakes I have seen people make:\n&gt;\n&gt; (1) People normally pronounce=\r\n anudattas and svaritas (letters with\nlines\n&gt; below or above) correctly, bu=\r\nt mess up when a few udattas come in a\nrow. For\n&gt; example, all the three le=\r\ntters in &quot;dheemahi&quot; are without any lines\nbelow or\n&gt; above. They have to be=\r\n pronounced in the same pitch. People end up\n&gt; introducing some pitch varia=\r\ntion and mispronouncing them. In veda\nmantras,\n&gt; pronouncing all udattas in=\r\n the same pitch is the most important thing.\nDo\n&gt; not stress any letter or =\r\ntake the pitch up/down when pronouncing a\nstring of\n&gt; udattas.\n&gt;\n&gt; (2) The =\r\nlast syllable of &quot;prachodayaat&quot; is &quot;yaat&quot;. It is supposed to\nbe one\n&gt; sylla=\r\nble. When you pronounce it correctly, &quot;t&quot; is hardly audible. If\nyou\n&gt; artif=\r\nicially add an vowel at the end of it and make it\n&quot;prachodayaatu&quot;, you\n&gt; wi=\r\nll end up introducing an extra syllable (&quot;tu&quot;) and mess up\neverything. A\n&gt; =\r\nlot of people do not pronounce &quot;t&quot; correctly. Probably some guru\nsometime\n&gt;=\r\n back started the practice of adding a brief vowel at the end of words\nendi=\r\nng\n&gt; in a consonant, so that his sishyas could listen clearly what\nconsonan=\r\nt he\n&gt; was saying. Unfortunately, it became a standard practice. This is go=\r\nod\nfor\n&gt; teaching, but wrong for sadhana. If a word ends in a consonant, en=\r\nd it\nwith\n&gt; a consonant (which cannot be heard clearly unless one tried har=\r\nd) and\ndo NOT\n&gt; add a brief vowel after that consonant.\n&gt;\n&gt; (3) Take &quot;dhiyo=\r\n yo naH&quot;. The &quot;H&quot; in &quot;naH&quot; is a visarga (written in\nSanskrit\n&gt; as &quot;:&quot; and n=\r\notated in itrans as &quot;H&quot;). Visarga means &quot;letting go&quot;. You\nare\n&gt; supposed to=\r\n let air go from you lungs in a quick exhalation.\nPronunciation\n&gt; of &quot;naH&quot; =\r\nis very close to &quot;nah&quot; though slightly different. Again, this\nis\n&gt; supposed=\r\n to be one syllable. A lot of people, especially south\nIndians, make\n&gt; it &quot;=\r\nnaha&quot;. Due to extra vowel added (a), an extra syllable (ha) is\nadded to\n&gt; t=\r\nhe mantra and that messes up everything. Again this is wrong.\n&gt;\n&gt; In this s=\r\ntyle of mispronouncing visarga, the same symbol &quot;H&quot; is\npronounced\n&gt; differe=\r\nntly in &quot;raamaH&quot;, &quot;hariH&quot; and &quot;guruH&quot;. The same symbol\n&gt; &quot;H&quot; or &quot;:&quot; is pron=\r\nounced as &quot;ha&quot;, &quot;hi&quot; and &quot;hu&quot; in the 3 words,\nrespectively\n&gt; (i.e. raamaha,=\r\n harihi, guruhu). That is wrong. If you pronounce it as\n&gt; letting air go, w=\r\nithout adding any vowel, it sounds identical in the 3\n&gt; words.\n&gt;\n&gt; Watch ou=\r\nt for these 3 common mistakes.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, as I keep saying, the pronuncia=\r\ntion is only a small\npercentage of\n&gt; it. Creating the right mental images a=\r\nnd the perfect mental focus is\nmore\n&gt; important. If you lose awareness of y=\r\nour body, successfully shut down\nall\n&gt; other thoughts in the mind and achie=\r\nve a perfect mental focus on any\nveda\n&gt; mantra with correct pronunciation, =\r\nit will be a fantastic experience.\nPlease\n&gt; note that correct pronunciation=\r\n is not difficult to achieve, but the\nother\n&gt; things I mentioned here are n=\r\not that easy!\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Vedic=\r\nAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; F=\r\nree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagann=\r\nath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message =\r\n-----\n&gt; From: &quot;sbm_sharma&quot; sbm_sharma@...\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, June 24, 2009 8:57 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Proper=\r\n Gayatri Mantra Pronunciation and\nIntonation -\n&gt; Audio Source\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear =\r\nNarasimha,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Could you point me towards any easily obtainable audio r=\r\necording of\nthe\n&gt; &gt; Gayatri mantra which you deem to be correctly executed?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also, would you mind typing it out here, phonetically?
