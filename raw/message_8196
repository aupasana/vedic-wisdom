The Dhenu mudra that is used in kalash suddh=\r\ni is not clear to me. I will be highly thankful if it is clarified to me. E=\r\narlier, I had learnt Surabhi Mudra in which the little finger touches ring =\r\nfinger of other hand and vice versa, middle finger touches index finger of =\r\nother hand and vice versa, the thumbs separated.The mudra that I had learnt=\r\n appears similar to the dhenu mudra shown in video eccept for the fact that=\r\n the thumbs are joined at tips in the video. Further both Dhunu and Surabhi=\r\n means cow. Are the same? What is the correct way of doing this mudra? =A0W=\r\naiting for your reply.\n&gt; Nawal=A0\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
