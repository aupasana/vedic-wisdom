It is of no use for me or anyone to tell you want to do, sitti=\r\nng on the sidelines. You will have to find your bearings yourself and chart=\r\n your course. But my 2 cents of comments on some specific points you covere=\r\nd.\n \nFirst, atheism vs theism is not really the crux here. God is not an eg=\r\noist who wants people to like him and praise him. Atheism was a valid path =\r\nto god within Sanatana Dharma, though the path taken by most atheists today=\r\n does not lead to god.\n \nAs long as one is attracted to some things and rep=\r\nelled by some things, one will keep running after some things and keep runn=\r\ning from some things. This run gives pleasure at times and pain at times an=\r\nd one fluctuates between them. Until one achieves samadrishti (equal vision=\r\n), where nothing is attractive and repulsive, one will keep running. Achiev=\r\ning sama drishti does not happen in a day and takes a long time.\n \nIt is po=\r\nssible to be an atheist who does not believe in god and yet view the whole =\r\nuniverse as arbitrary and not be swayed by attractions and repulsions. It i=\r\ns possible to be a theist who does many rituals and prayers to god and yet =\r\nremains swayed by thousands of desires, attractions and repulsions.\n \nSecon=\r\ndly, whatever we experience is an equal reaction (result) to some action we=\r\n ourselves performed earlier (in the same life or a previous life). Because=\r\n there is a time gap between actions and results and because we do not reme=\r\nmber some past actions, we are unable to associate the results with actions=\r\n. But, nothing happens to one unless one&#39;s own actions gave a chance/sancti=\r\non. It is possible to say that there is no god, what happens to one is a re=\r\nsult of one&#39;s own actions and engaging in actions with sama drishti liberat=\r\nes one (e.g. Buddha). It may not be the only or the best path to liberation=\r\n, but it is A valid path within Sanatana Dharma to liberation.\n \nSo, if you=\r\n see someone with bad conduct doing well, it must be a result of good condu=\r\nct in the past. If you see someone with good conduct doing badly, it must b=\r\ne a result of bad conduct in the past.\n \nYour present is not in your contro=\r\nl. Your present was under your control in the past, but not anymore. Howeve=\r\nr, your future is under your control now. By doing good deeds now, you can =\r\nensure good future. Regret about the past or bitterness about the present r=\r\nesults of past deeds should not cloud one&#39;s judgment w.r.t. present actions=\r\n.\n \nDo the right actions now, that you think will give you the kind of futu=\r\nre you are hoping for. At the same time, if possible, work on eliminating h=\r\nopes like &quot;I want this kind of future or that kind of future&quot;. As long as s=\r\nuch notions are there, one guesses what actions produce such future, one en=\r\ngages in various actions and fulfils one&#39;s hope to varying degrees and gene=\r\nrates new hopes in the process. It is an infinite cycle. One is liberated o=\r\nnly when one is free from these hopes and desires. But, worry about liberat=\r\nion is secondary. Primary thing is to engage in the right actions that give=\r\n you the future you hope for.\n \nNamaste Sundeep,\n \nShakti worship is not ju=\r\nst certain rituals. Saattwik aspects of Shakti manifest as various kinds of=\r\n knowledge, raajasik aspects of Shakti manifest as various kinds of actions=\r\n, taamasik aspects of Shakti manifest as various kinds of desires. Whether =\r\none is aware or not, one is worshipping various forms of Shakti every momen=\r\nt through one&#39;s desires, actions and knowledge!\n \nHowever, this happens in =\r\nan uncontrolled and unaware fashion. Formal worship of specific Shakti form=\r\ns aims to fill this worship with awareness.\n \nReal life relief and enlighte=\r\nnment that you speak of is given by Shakti, but that can come with or witho=\r\nut formal worship of Shakti.\n \nOne small but subtle point. Suppose one wors=\r\nhips Vishnu or Shiva or Agni or Surya, but mind is strongly focused on cert=\r\nain desires or actions or knowledge. Then, can I really say that one is not=\r\n worshipping Shakti? Who is Shakti after all? If you see Chandipath second =\r\nchapter, you will see that She is a personification of the sum total of the=\r\n energies of various deities. Purusha is the potential energy and Shakti is=\r\n the kinetic energy. Some of the kinetic energies of all gods (or all being=\r\n actually) is Aadi Shakti. If one interested in kinetic aspects is worshipp=\r\ning any deity (Vishnu or Shiva or Surya or Agni or whoever), one is then es=\r\nsentially worshipping the kinetic energy aspect of that deity. That is noth=\r\ning but a part of Aadi Shakti. Thus, without formal worship of Shakti and b=\r\ny worship of other deities also, one can effectively worship Shakti and get=\r\n Shakti&#39;s blessings.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyoti=\r\nsh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Hom=\r\nam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n    =\r\n Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality=\r\n: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n---------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n \n---- vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@ya=\r\nhoo.com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Dear Sri,\n&gt; I know exactly what you mean. I have problems=\r\n that put me in the same (very) weak situation right now and feel quite hop=\r\neless at times. I know to some extent the way out of it, and to some extent=\r\n I would like to see some answers by the knowledgeable on this group especi=\r\nally PVRji.\n&gt;\n&gt; First let me tell you this - stop wasting your time in tryi=\r\nng to find verbal logic to &quot;prove&quot; the existence of the concept of &quot;God&quot;. P=\r\neople will present you with lots of different logical and illogical argumen=\r\nts. Logical arguments, even scriptural ones, dont give permanent relief. Bo=\r\nth your fears, and your real problems, will certainly overwhelm any logical=\r\n arguments eventually. There must be real growth (real internal change) for=\r\n real relief.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, let me give you some basic logic. I am not contradic=\r\nting myself, just the logic will not help you. It simply opens a path, you =\r\nmust follow it to some minor extent at least to see the light. Otherwise, s=\r\nimply as logic, it will certainly fail. So here it is..\n&gt;\n&gt; In my very simp=\r\nle and totally honest observation, I notice that thinking of other people&#39;s=\r\n problems DOES NOT give me even one-tenth as much pain as thinking of my ow=\r\nn problems. Do you agree that it is the same for you? So, clearly, the conc=\r\nept of &quot;I&quot; and &quot;ownership&quot; is the key pathway for the pain. Now, there are =\r\n2 possibilities here - either there is nothing more than the I (the atheist=\r\nic view), or there is something more than the I (the theistic view). The fi=\r\nrst path for you and me leads to continuous pain (at least right now), beca=\r\nuse it means either there is pain or there is nothing, because at least I c=\r\nan&#39;t think of any easy material solution to my problems - they must be live=\r\nd through. So the first path is not very useful. So, you will agree that it=\r\n is worthwhile to at least try out the second path. Now, if the second path=\r\n is real, there is something more than the I, so there must be a way to at =\r\nleast temporarily disassociate your deeper consciousness from the &quot;I&quot; and &quot;=\r\nownership&quot; that is the key pathway to the pain? For me, I have found that c=\r\noncentration meditation (even with mantras) wasn&#39;t doing the trick. I switc=\r\nhed to complete surrender based meditation in which I actually gave myself =\r\nto whatever it is that is out there (for me this was a long path, eventuall=\r\ny I found through dreams and hints that it had to be a mother based form th=\r\nat I had to give myself up to). Now this is easier said than done. You cant=\r\n form the words &quot;I give up myself to you&quot; in your mind. That is totally, th=\r\noroughly, useless, because the moment you form the words, the &quot;I&quot; proudly t=\r\nakes control and starts trying to give up everything but itself. Somewhere =\r\nwithin your meditating mind &quot;you&quot; must catch yourself and let it to go. Thi=\r\ns is the very subjective part - I cant help anymore with this part since it=\r\n is a very personal thing - but nevertheless is key to any success.\n&gt;\n&gt; It =\r\nis at this point that I get the proof, and I expect you will too. Rather th=\r\nan disappearing into nothingness or sleep, which is what you might expect, =\r\nat least sometimes (and sometimes not on very bad days), I feel a rush of e=\r\nxpansive, blissful relief. Pure, blessed, much needed relief from the troub=\r\nles of the mind. It is very expansive, you might suddenly get a thought of =\r\nyou falling into a huge ocean, or an endless green field in warm sunlight.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; So that&#39;s the good part. The point is, when I come out of it, I am the =\r\nsame old angry, bitter, stressed out person (trust me, I make the same old =\r\nmistakes all over again). But with one difference - I have a memory of some=\r\nthing pure - and that makes me keep on going.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now the question to PVRji=\r\n - I understand that the relief corresponds in some sense to a small patch =\r\nof nirvikalpa samadhi. But exactly as outlined in Tripura Rahasya, it does =\r\nnot correlate with real life. So is it correct to say that if you want to h=\r\nave any kind of real life enlightenment or improvement in your actions, you=\r\n must necessarily do some Shakti type worship?\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sundee=\r\np\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Astro Seeker &lt;astro.seeker@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt; Dear All,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have tried to make spiritual progress for lo=\r\nng, and made little progress (but\n&gt; &gt; not significant). Ever since my child=\r\nhood, primarily because of my upbringing, I\n&gt; &gt; have been trying and observ=\r\ning a lot of &quot;Good&quot; things. I have been reading texts\n&gt; &gt; on spirituality a=\r\nnd was a lot impressed by Swami Vivekananda&#39;s writings. I\n&gt; &gt; always found =\r\nKabir&#39;s following lines, as a best (and most compact) commentary on\n&gt; &gt; the=\r\n two prominent paths of spirituality: -\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Ek kahoon to hai nahee, do=\r\n kahoon to gaari&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Hai jaisa taisa rahe, kahat kabir vicharee&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ni.e.\n&gt; &gt; &quot;If I say One, it is not, If I say two, it is contemplation&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;=\r\nLet it be what it is, says Kabir after contemplation&quot;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Until last ye=\r\nar, my faith was getting stronger and stronger in my beliefs. Last\n&gt; &gt; year=\r\n made gave me lot of troubles as well as lot of personal time to think. I\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; have come up with several doubts (just a few given below) about spiritua=\r\nlity and\n&gt; &gt; God and Goodness, and I have started to feel getting drifted t=\r\nowards atheism\n&gt; &gt; (susprisingly am writing all this on Vaikuntha Ekadashi,=\r\n when am observing a\n&gt; &gt; fast). If someone can help me understand the probl=\r\nesm with my doubts, it would\n&gt; &gt; be great help:-\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; - Isn&#39;t &quot;Ishwar Pa=\r\nridhaan&quot; i.e. &quot;Ishwar yat karoti shobhanam karoti&quot; same as\n&gt; &gt; stockholm sy=\r\nndrome?\n&gt; &gt; - Most people with good conduct I see these days are suffering =\r\nand those who\n&gt; &gt; happily claim themselves to be atheists, lead a prosperou=\r\ns life. Where is the\n&gt; &gt; supreme power&#39;s role in this. I know materialism i=\r\ns a different issue, but last\n&gt; &gt; year made me realize that materialistic t=\r\nroubles made me very weak spiritually\n&gt; &gt; too. So, I dont see them to be co=\r\nnnected somehow.\n&gt; &gt; - I do understand that in Kali Yuga, the patience leve=\r\nls are low, and so called\n&gt; &gt; Godly correction of the wrong doing, takes it=\r\ns own time. But doesn&#39;t that\n&gt; &gt; promotes the bad karma in itself, speciall=\r\ny in this yuga? And how long can one\n&gt; &gt; wait?\n&gt; &gt; - Suicide is considered =\r\na greatest sin, as it is throwing away the best gift we\n&gt; &gt; get from the lo=\r\nrd. But, I am not sure that if people do it for fun. God presents\n&gt; &gt; a per=\r\nson with tough situations in the name of testing times, and some day the\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; limit is reached. Then isn&#39;t god accomplice in this so called crime.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n- In first place, why does he need to test us?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; As I said that all t=\r\nhese question make me feel that I am losing the faith in His\n&gt; &gt; goodness. =\r\nAll my spiritual progress if any has been corrupted by these testing\n&gt; &gt; ti=\r\nmes. And no help came to me(I could not figure out). And those who did offe=\r\nr,\n&gt; &gt; faced a lot of troubles themselves and are also suffering now. This =\r\nis what\n&gt; &gt; makes me go mad about it, as I am unable to bear this that I ha=\r\nve passed my\n&gt; &gt; agony to someone.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Despite all these thoughts that =\r\nhave pre-occupied my mind for quite some time, I\n&gt; &gt; feel that I still surv=\r\nive a chance to get back to my faith in real terms and not\n&gt; &gt; driven by ma=\r\nterialistic desire. This is the reason I am writing this mail. May\n&gt; &gt; be s=\r\nomeone can make me see what I am missing here. Else, I see myself getting\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; totally crazy, insane and moving towards atheism and quit possibly commi=\r\ntting\n&gt; &gt; the so called &quot;Sin&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Sri\n\n\n"}}
