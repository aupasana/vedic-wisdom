He was one day given a small speck of some substance o=\r\nn a leaf,to be\nlicked off. It was said to be a good help for digestion.He l=\r\nicked it. Later\nHe had His meal. After some time, the assembled persons app=\r\neared to be\nsurrounded by Light (tejomaya). The experience passed away afte=\r\nr some time.\n\n2. While He was living in Pavalakunru. He intended to have a =\r\nbath in one of\nthe rills on the hillside. Palaniswami was informed of it.Th=\r\ne news spread,\nthat Jada Padmanabhaswami, who was living on the Hill, had a=\r\nrranged with\nPalaniswami to take Sri Bhagavan to the hill near his cottage.=\r\n Palaniswami,\nwithout informing Sri Bhagavan,managed to take Him there. A g=\r\nreat reception\nawaited Him. A seat was arranged for Him, milk and fruits we=\r\nre offered and\nJ. P. waited on Him with great kindness.\n\n3. J.P., though re=\r\npresented in the book Self-Realisation as having sought to\ninjure Sri Bhaga=\r\nvan, was really kind to Him and his pranks were\nmisunderstood to be acts of=\r\n malice. His only weakness was that he wanted to\nmake capital out of Sri Bh=\r\nagavan for raising funds; which, of course, the\nMaharshi did not like. Ther=\r\ne was nothing wrong with J.P.\n\n4. Madhavaswami, the attendant, asked if Sri=\r\n Bhagavan remained without food\nfor months in the underground cellar in the=\r\n temple.\n\nM.: Um! - Um! - food was forthcoming - Milk, fruits - but whoever=\r\n thought of\nfood.\n\n5.While staying in the mango-tree cave Sri Bhagavan used=\r\n to string garlands\nfor the images in the temple, with lotuses, yellow flow=\r\ners (sarakonnai) and\ngreen leaves.\n\n6. After the completion of the Kalyanam=\r\nantapam Sri Bhagavan had stayed there\none night in disguise.\n\n7. When He wa=\r\ns sitting under a tree in the temple compound He was covered\nwith dirt, for=\r\n He never used to bathe. In the cold nights of December He\nused to fold up =\r\nthe legs, place his head between his legs and remain there\nwithout moving. =\r\nEarly in the morning the layer of dirt on His body was\nsoaked with dew and =\r\nmist and appeared white.After drying up in the sun it\nappeared dark.\n\n8. Wh=\r\nen living on the Hill Sri Bhagavan used to help in the pooja of J. P.,\nring=\r\ning the bell, washing the vessels, etc.,all along remaining silent. He\nalso=\r\n used to read medical works, e.g., Ashtanga Hridayam in Malayalam and\npoint=\r\n out the treatment contained in the book for the patients who sought\nthe ot=\r\nher sadhu=E2=80=99s help. That sadhu did not himself know how to read these=\r\n\nworks.\n\nSource: Talks With Ramana Maharshi Book\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =\r\n=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =\r\n =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd5c8e802458f0489855fc6\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;line-height:normal&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;m=\r\nargin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nspan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Talk 357&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Sri Bhagavan was rec=\r\nounting some of the incidents of His stay in Tiruvannamalai:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1.
