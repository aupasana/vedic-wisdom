In order\nthat human greatness proliferates in both these areas =\r\nculture and\ncivilizations have come into being which lay down the =91do=92s=\r\n and don=92ts=92 of\nthinking and character carving. Culture is internal, Ci=\r\nvility is external,\nSpirituality is internal and Ethics is external. Spirit=\r\nual aims are attained\nvia its philosophy and a disciplined character helps =\r\nin adherence of ethics.\nThe peripheries of all religious precepts that infl=\r\nuence human glory in a\nbig way are limited to these 2 aspects. It has alrea=\r\ndy been said that the\ninner core of religion is spirituality and its outer =\r\nshell is wholesome\nsocial behavior laced with ethical activities. These are=\r\n the 4 pillars of\nreligion. If anyone requires more clarity on these the fo=\r\nllowing paragraphs\ncan do the needful.\n\n1) SPIRITUALITY: True spirituality =\r\nexists where the psyche oozes with sacred\nbeliefs, faiths, aspirations, sen=\r\ntiments, zest and habits. The fount or root\nsource of man=92s personality a=\r\nnd character lies here. It is that inspiration\nwhich gives direction to the=\r\n mind=92s thinking process. If prejudices exist\nthey result in imaginations=\r\n, arguments and logical proof. These in turn help\nthe intellect to take inf=\r\normed decisions. The brain obeys commands emanating\nfrom the deep recesses =\r\nof our psyche. It finds ways of fulfilling that which\nis pleasurable, it fi=\r\nnds solutions for various problems and thus commands\nthe body to act as per=\r\n the directions of the inner psyche.\n\nIn a nutshell we can say that this in=\r\nner designing of the psyche decides\nman=92s past history, endeavors of the =\r\npresent and destiny of future times.\nThis designing helps us measure man=92=\r\ns inner stature. It is as a reaction of\nthis area that other individuals ap=\r\nproach us as foes or friends. This is the\nfocal point that decides the dire=\r\nction of man=92s life. On its basis man\nexperiences a downfall or otherwise=\r\n, joy or sorrow and success or failure.\nSpiritual philosophy came into exis=\r\ntence solely for the purpose of\novercoming demonic tendencies of the psyche=\r\n from their very roots and\nreplacing them with sacred qualities like divine=\r\n wisdom etc.\n\nSpiritual philosophy is the foundation stone of attaining spi=\r\nritual\ngrandeur/greatness. The gigantic mould of Brahma Vidya (Divine Wisdo=\r\nm) has\nbeen cast so as to attain this divine glory. The fundamental aim of =\r\nprecepts\nthat talk of God, soul, demigods, other world, heaven, reincarnati=\r\non, fruits\nof ones actions, salvation, hell, liberation, emancipation, devo=\r\ntion,\nspiritual practices, Sidhis (Divine Powers) etc. is to dissuade man f=\r\nrom\nimbibing lowly aspirations and instead aspire for higher peaks of human=\r\n\nglory. For this various religions ordain mankind to absorb sacred thinking=\r\n\nand act ethically in their day to day worldly transactions.\n\nThe fundament=\r\nal basis of spirituality is refined faith. True faith is\ncertainly not the =\r\nfigment of ones wayward imagination. It should not be\nlabeled as =91doubt=\r\n=92. Hence spiritual precepts are given a sound footing by\ngiving proof in =\r\nthe form of various scriptural injunctions, great speech of\nRishis, saints =\r\netc, divine inspirations, God=92s commands, discourses and\nmythology. It is=\r\n left to Spiritual Philosophy to prove all this via logic,\nprecepts and sou=\r\nnd arguments.\n\n\n2) ETHICS AND APPROPRIATE BEHAVIOR: Wholesome behavior enco=\r\nmpasses\nobservations of ethics, integrity etc in ones professional and soci=\r\nal life.\nThe chief aim of all religious scriptures is to make laws based on=\r\n ethics,\nideals etc. Smritis (Indian scriptures) have detailed man=92s inne=\r\nr and\nexternal (social) duties and responsibilities. It can be said to be a=\r\n vow or\nresolve of imbibing sacred actions and duties. Duty is emphasized u=\r\npon and\nrights are said to be secondary. Further mankind is urged to ignore=\r\n worries\nrelated to enticements, fear, pressures etc and instead focus one =\r\npointedly\non an ethical and righteous way of living.\n\nEthics based scriptur=\r\nes (Neeti Shastra) urges world humanity to imbibe\noneness of soul with all =\r\nliving beings, gentlemanliness, sacred character,\nself control and simple l=\r\niving-high thinking. We must celebrate birthdays of\ngreat people of the wor=\r\nld who renounced their all for the sake of great\nideals. Hence sermons and =\r\ndiscourses that describe the lives of such great\nsouls are given so that ma=\r\nn too gets inspired to follow in their footsteps.\nIn this manner the layman=\r\n=92s self control can be nourished and he will\nwillingly imbibe a sacred wa=\r\ny of living. An important point to be noted is\nthat when man vows to lead a=\r\nn ethical life hardships do come his way. At\nsuch times material lures and =\r\nenticements have to be curbed via self control\n(Sanyam). This control is ca=\r\nlled Laya sadhana. Why is a man of true\nausterities very powerful mentally?=\r\n The answer is that he gives up desires\nfor selfish gains and instead chann=\r\nels his energy in the direction of world\nwelfare. In this manner he himself=\r\n attains soul fulfillment, respect from\nthe world, love and cooperation and=\r\n divine grace without even having an\ninkling of such desires in his mind. M=\r\neaning all this comes his way, unasked\nand unsolicited. Ethics can be nurtu=\r\nred only when greatness enters every\npore of our mental character, actions =\r\nand inner qualities. In this manner\nour character and personality touch hei=\r\nghts of human grandeur and glory.\n\nEthics and ideals have been classified a=\r\nnd described from many standpoints.\nManu Smriti describes 10 characteristic=\r\ns of ethics. Almost all these have\nbeen elucidated in the Yama-Niyama aphor=\r\nisms of Raja Yoga. In other\nreligious texts all this has been covered albei=\r\nt with minor variations here\nand there. It is these common principles of et=\r\nhics in various religions that\nmakes us say that fundamentally all religion=\r\ns are one. Of course the mode of\napplication and methods of imbibing these =\r\nethics in day to day living do\nvary amongst various religions. The outer sh=\r\nells of tradition in various\nreligions have come to being depending on the =\r\ncircumstances prevailing in\nthose times when a particular religion was esta=\r\nblished. These traditions\nchange when times and external circumstances chan=\r\nge. It is but natural that\nwhen these traditions become worn with age disto=\r\nrtions and taints enter\nthem. Under such circumstances it becomes imperativ=\r\ne that they be\ntransformed and reformed in a wholesome manner. Despite this=\r\n the fact\nremains that the principles of ethics that urge mankind to live a=\r\n life of\nhuman greatness remains intact. It is hence in this context that w=\r\ne proclaim\nthat all religions are eternal in nature.\n............ to be con=\r\ntinued ................\n\n\nAuthor : Pt shriram Sharma Acharya\n\n-- \nThank you=\r\n  & Have a Fulfilling Day\n\nVenkat Koppaka\n\r\n--0015175cf70af333b1046f8d8477\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Dear ALL,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Human life is =\r\nbound by inner duties and external responsibilities.

Hence ser=\r\nmons and discourses that describe the lives of such great souls are given s=\r\no that man too gets inspired to follow in their footsteps.
