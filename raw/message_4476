At one time she lived at Karedu\nvil=\r\nlage in Nellore district where her husband was posted. Her first born, a\nbo=\r\ny, passed away. Later she had a boy and a girl.\n\nCalamities befell her almo=\r\nst all at one stroke. Her son, daughter and\nhusband passed away one after t=\r\nhe other in quick succession. She bore them\nstoically and went back to her =\r\nplace with her last daughter. When the girl\nwas about ten Echammal fixed up=\r\n her marriage. A few days before the wedding\nthe girl developed high fever.=\r\n\n\nA few days after the girl passed away.\n\nAccompanied by a friend she visit=\r\ned the ramana mahashi who was then staying\nat Virupaksha cave. She noticed =\r\nthat the form which had appeared in her\ndreams three times earlier was of t=\r\nhis very Sadguru. She sat in silence for\nan hour. The Swami was as usual si=\r\nlent. She was not inclined to return, it\nwas as if her feet got planted\nthe=\r\nre. Yet she had to return. On reaching home she told her friend that the\nop=\r\npressive weight in her heart torturing her in the recent past had gone.\n\nFr=\r\nom that day she regularly visited the ashram, like an iron filing\nattracted=\r\n to a magnet. She also began serving food to the Swami. She used\nthe money =\r\nsent by her father,and later by her brother, for the service of\nthe Swami a=\r\nnd his disciples. She would prepare food for them and serve it\nwherever the=\r\ny went. For a number of Ramana devotees her house became a\nlodging place.\n\n=\r\nWith the permission of the Swami she adopted her niece, Chellammal, and\nper=\r\nformed her marriage. She named her grandson after Ramana. One day, she\nrece=\r\nived a telegram from her son-in-law saying that Chellammal had passed\naway-=\r\n which came as a bolt from the blue.\n\nThe Swami showed her his grace in sev=\r\neral ways. Here are a couple of such\ninstances.\n\nOne day while Echammal was=\r\n climbing the hill carrying food for the Swami\nthere was a heavy downpour.S=\r\nhe took shelter at a particular place and looked\nat the Swami who was not f=\r\nar away. She observed that the area surrounding\nhim was absolutely dry wher=\r\neas at a little distance from him it was raining\nheavily!\n\nOn another occas=\r\nion, a Pandit from the North visited the Swami at Virupaksha\ncave and was d=\r\niscussing some subtle points with the Swami. When Echammal\nreached the cave=\r\n as usual she was astonished at what she saw. She began\ntrembling when the =\r\nSwami asked her the reason.She narrated her experience\nthus: On reaching th=\r\ne Sadguru Swami cave on her way, she felt that there\nwere two persons - one=\r\n of whom was the Swami and the other the visitor close\nby. Without halting =\r\nshe moved along. As she was doing so a voice said =E2=80=9CWhy\nclimb when h=\r\ne is here?=E2=80=9D When she turned back she could see nobody at the\nspot o=\r\nr nearabouts. She trembled with fear at this experience and somehow\nreached=\r\n Virupaksha cave. The Sastry then said to the Swami. =E2=80=9CYou have been=\r\n\nspeaking to me here but appeared before her at a different place! You have=\r\n\nnot blessed me with your grace similarly.=E2=80=9D\n\nThe Swami merely said =\r\nthat because Echammal was constantly thinking of him\nshe saw his form elsew=\r\nhere.But the question still remained as to why she\nshould see the visitor a=\r\nlso!\n\nEchammal was a sattvic devotee. With all her devotion to the Swami sh=\r\ne never\nignored other great souls. She had great devotion for Seshadri Swam=\r\ni also\nwho was pleased\nwith her goodness and devotion. Seshadri Swami who n=\r\neither allowed others to\ncome near him nor go to others,would visit Echamma=\r\nl=E2=80=99s house.\n\nThe Swami rid Sivaprakasam Pillai of worldly desires an=\r\nd put him on the path\nof enquiry. He did the same for Echammal also. But fo=\r\nr the Swami=E2=80=99s grace how\ncould a person immersed in sorrow because o=\r\nf worldly affairs, get on to the\npath of self-enquiry?\n\nSource: SRI RAMANA =\r\nLEELA (A BIOGRAPHY OF BHAGAVAN SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI)\nTelugu original Sri Kri=\r\nshna Bhikshu Edited and Translated by Pingali Surya\nSundaram\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=\r\n=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd4c9f401859004893227c6\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;LAKSHMI Ammal, usually referred to as Echammmal,belonged to Mandakolutur=\r\n about twenty miles away from Arunachala.
