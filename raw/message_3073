After all, opponent i=\r\nn a debate is different from a &quot;questioner&quot; or a disciple seeking spiritual=\r\n direction.\n \n&gt; The topic of the meeting was something like &quot;Concept of God=\r\n in\n&gt; Hinduism and Islam&quot;.

In fact, this is a =\r\nquestion that was raised by disciples of Sri Sri than those that dont know =\r\nhim. In fact, if one looks into it, one will be dumbfounded! How is it that=\r\n somebody like Sri Sri, who has commented exhaustively on several scripture=\r\ns, who is an authority on vedanta both by his inner Realization and learnin=\r\ng, who recited the Bhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old without anybody te=\r\naching him, and who gives impromptu discourses in various forums across the=\r\n world on all topics under the sun shy away from explaining some simple que=\r\nstions that are about his home turf?\n&gt; \n&gt; The answer is that Sri Sri did no=\r\nt debate. He never debates on Truth! To him Truth / God is not an article o=\r\nf debate. He can show the way to Realization of Truth to those that are rea=\r\ndy. He is not interested in anything else. He answers only when there is si=\r\nncerity in the heart of the questioner. Otherwise he would say some polite =\r\nwords and let it pass, however big the occasion may be. Most of the questio=\r\nns that were raised in that meeting were answered elaborately by Sri Sri in=\r\n his various commentaries & discourses year ago!\n&gt; \n&gt; One may ask why then =\r\ndid he go to this meeting or whatever it was? The topic of the meeting was =\r\nsomething like &quot;Concept of God in Hinduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did ju=\r\nstice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; an embodiment of the very thing that was supp=\r\nosedly the topic of discussion. Those that were ready to benefit from it fr=\r\nom the audience would have benefited. \n&gt; \n&gt; ************\n&gt; \n&gt; The below par=\r\nt is not for Rajarshi but may be of interest to everyone, especially those =\r\namong us that are intellectually curious about spirituality than practicing=\r\n it. \n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Sri always practices &quot;experience first and explanation and k=\r\nnowledge later&quot; principle. Sometimes in AOL, there will be big congregation=\r\n of thousands of people and Sri Sri will only say very simple things or sha=\r\nre some simple jokes and laughs, but his presence would convey what needs t=\r\no be conveyed for those that are receptive. A Master may not be interested =\r\nin getting 100,000 people trading one mental concept for another, but prefe=\r\nrs one sincere person opening up to Truth in silence. A Masters mere presen=\r\nce is enough for that to happen. Words are secondary and optional. In spiri=\r\ntual discussions,  the point of words is to create inner silence or illumin=\r\nation and if that is not created, there is no point in talking! \n&gt; \n&gt; It is=\r\n a great privilege and an immense blessing to be in the presence of a livin=\r\ng Master whether it is Sri Sri or someone else. We gain immensely if we lis=\r\nten to them from our Being instead of our mind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s life, =\r\nthere are innumerable examples of very simple people benefiting from his me=\r\nre looks & presence while big intellectuals would debate with him and miss =\r\nthe opportunity of a lifetime. Sometimes when he countered insincere querie=\r\ns, Sri Ramakrishna would feign ignorance and say what would I know - I am a=\r\nn illiterate! What a disaster it would have been for a seeker if he were to=\r\n label Sri Ramakrishna as an illiterate and ignoramus!\n&gt; \n&gt; Without an acco=\r\nmpanying experience (at least a small glimpse or even a fragment of an expe=\r\nrience) accumulating knowledge can be very dangerous as it will become yet =\r\nanother mental concept and will actually be a hindrance to the Sadhak. Some=\r\n of the most subtle and dangerous hindrances for a sadhak are created by no=\r\nne other than the sadhak&#39;s empty concepts of spirituality and God! Things l=\r\nike lust, greed, anger, etc., stand out conspicuously and are in that way l=\r\ness dangerous. \n&gt; \n&gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt;    Siva.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; =C2 =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nice mail.

I occasionally visit this forum. I =\r\nhappened to see several emails about AOL and the below email from Shri. Nar=\r\nasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual practices and as a disciple =\r\nand devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want to clarify a few things to the e=\r\nxtent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are several paths each leadin=\r\ng to the destination of Sat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use aus=\r\nterities, some use devotion, etc. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss is=\r\n also blissful. That does not make it in any way inferior to paths of auste=\r\nrities. As Sri Aurobindo would call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path=\r\n one does not suddenly emerge into SatChitAnanda. The personality of the sa=\r\ndhak is transformed slowly and the sadhak radiates more and more as they pr=\r\nogress more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a seamless blen=\r\nd of Raja yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice i=\r\nn AOL is not just doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)und=\r\nerstood. Pranayams and Sudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing and settling =\r\nof the mind and preparing for meditation and doing other spiritual practice=\r\ns of contemplation, Seva for rest of the day wit the right attitude. Regula=\r\nr practice of Sudarshan Kriya removes / breaks old patterns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; AOL includes some yoga asanas to prepare the body (the Padma Sadhana sequ=\r\nence of asanas taught in DSN course and Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar) ta=\r\nught in Part II or advance courses fall under this category.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe raja yoga practices include all the pranayams, Sudarshan Kriya, mudras, =\r\nbandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living course, advance courses, Sahaj=\r\n samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The Knowledge part includes d=\r\neep contemplative study and imbibing of Narada Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yog=\r\na Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat Gita. Sri Sri Ravishankar has given =\r\nvery elaborate commentary on all of the above. His commentary on Bhakti Sut=\r\nras runs to 30 or so tapes and the publicly available commentary on Ashtava=\r\nkra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! Besides daily study of Yoga Vashisht=\r\nam is highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; recommended. Learning and contemplation of this Wisdom i=\r\ns mandatory for those that strive to become Art of Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The path of AOL emphasises on Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru p=\r\narampara, nama sankeertan and bhajans are a standard feature of AOL satsang=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some wonder why AOL charges for these courses and some wond=\r\ner about lack of a Sadhguru at every stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Let me clarify fro=\r\nm my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened M=\r\naster living in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of guiding millions =\r\nof devotees in every step of the sadhana without having to be near them in =\r\nperson. Several get necessary guidance in dreams (I myself had that experie=\r\nnce twice), some in person and several via various other ways. However, to =\r\nget these guidance, an inner connection with the Master is essential. Until=\r\n that stage, the various AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and in-depth comm=\r\nentaries on various Knowledge are more than enough to guide disciples to a =\r\nstage where conscious inner communion with Guru can be established.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Several of the senior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are yog=\r\nis of a very high order capable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness at =\r\nwill during meditation. They may be not fully established in it like Sri Sr=\r\ni, but act as channels of the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as=\r\n and when needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept those that left th=\r\neir body as having achieved highest realization such as Sri Aurobindo or Sr=\r\ni Ramakrishna or Ramana Maharishi. However it is a human tendency to doubt =\r\nthem when they are in physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging mo=\r\nney for its courses: AOL is world&#39;s largest volunteer run organization. Nei=\r\nther AOL teachers nor its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits=\r\n. All the proceeds go to the charitable activities again run by volunteers.=\r\n Many of the full time teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and mi=\r\nllions worth in property to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Rav=\r\nishankar neither needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri=\r\n Sri have went through very bad and sometimes even dangerous conditions to =\r\nbring the Knowledge to the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowledg=\r\ne needs to be revealed to maximum number of people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Senior AOL=\r\n teachers have faced danger to their lives by going without any help or gui=\r\ndance to areas infested with naxalites, terrorists in North East, Kashmir, =\r\nIraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. with nothing but love and Divine =\r\nGrace as their aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, money is charged in AOL =\r\ncourses for two reasons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experience showed that those =\r\nthat paid for the courses seem to follow the practices more diligently. It =\r\nis Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving person should be denied a course be=\r\ncause they cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part of organizing s=\r\neveral AOL courses and know first hand many cases where people took courses=\r\n for free and were also provided free accommodation, etc. Whenever natural =\r\ndisaster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from their own pocket or by =\r\nAOL and teach courses for free and provide healing to the victims. AOL does=\r\n not advertise it or make a show of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) This is my understa=\r\nnding and not AOl position. It removes the Karmic debt to the AOL teachers =\r\nand volunteers who still may have some doership in them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Final=\r\nly, Sri Sri is only interested in getting everyone turn inwards and express=\r\n the love, joy and compassion that is inside everyone.

In fact, this=\r\n is a \nquestion that was raised by disciples of Sri Sri than those that don=\r\nt know him. \nIn fact, if one looks into it, one will be dumbfounded! How is=\r\n it that somebody \nlike Sri Sri, who has commented exhaustively on several =\r\nscriptures, who is an \nauthority on vedanta both by his inner Realization a=\r\nnd learning, who recited the \nBhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old without=\r\n anybody teaching him, and who \ngives impromptu discourses in various forum=\r\ns across the world on all topics \nunder the sun shy away from explaining so=\r\nme simple questions that are about his \nhome turf?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The ans=\r\nwer is that Sri Sri did not debate. He never \ndebates on Truth! To him Trut=\r\nh / God is not an article of debate. He can show \nthe way to Realization of=\r\n Truth to those that are ready. He is not interested in \nanything else. He =\r\nanswers only when there is sincerity in the heart of the \nquestioner. Other=\r\nwise he would say some polite words and let it pass, however \nbig the occas=\r\nion may be. Most of the questions that were raised in that meeting \nwere an=\r\nswered elaborately by Sri Sri in his various commentaries &amp; \ndiscourses=\r\n year ago!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; One may ask why then did he go to this \nmeeting=\r\n or whatever it was? The topic of the meeting was something like &quot;Concept \n=\r\nof God in Hinduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;B=\r\nEING&quot; \nan embodiment of the very thing that was supposedly the topic of dis=\r\ncussion. \nThose that were ready to benefit from it from the audience would =\r\nhave benefited. \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ************&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The below =\r\npart is not for \nRajarshi but may be of interest to everyone, especially th=\r\nose among us that are \nintellectually curious about spirituality than pract=\r\nicing it. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nSri Sri always practices &quot;experience first and=\r\n explanation and knowledge later&quot; \nprinciple. Sometimes in AOL, there will =\r\nbe big congregation of thousands of \npeople and Sri Sri will only say very =\r\nsimple things or share some simple jokes \nand laughs, but his presence woul=\r\nd convey what needs to be conveyed for those \nthat are receptive. A Master =\r\nmay not be interested in getting 100,000 people \ntrading one mental concept=\r\n for another, but prefers one sincere person opening \nup to Truth in silenc=\r\ne. A Masters mere presence is enough for that to happen. \nWords are seconda=\r\nry and optional. In spiritual discussions,&nbsp; the point of \nwords is to =\r\ncreate inner silence or illumination and if that is not created, \nthere is =\r\nno point in talking! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It is a great privilege and an \nimme=\r\nnse blessing to be in the presence of a living Master whether it is Sri Sri=\r\n \nor someone else. We gain immensely if we listen to them from our Being in=\r\nstead \nof our mind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s life, there are innumerable exampl=\r\nes of very \nsimple people benefiting from his mere looks &amp; presence whi=\r\nle big \nintellectuals would debate with him and miss the opportunity of a l=\r\nifetime. \nSometimes when he countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna wo=\r\nuld feign \nignorance and say what would I know - I am an illiterate! What a=\r\n disaster it \nwould have been for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakris=\r\nhna as an \nilliterate and ignoramus!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Without an accompanyi=\r\nng experience \n(at least a small glimpse or even a fragment of an experienc=\r\ne) accumulating \nknowledge can be very dangerous as it will become yet anot=\r\nher mental concept and \nwill actually be a hindrance to the Sadhak. Some of=\r\n the most subtle and \ndangerous hindrances for a sadhak are created by none=\r\n other than the sadhak&#39;s \nempty concepts of spirituality and God! Things li=\r\nke lust, greed, anger, etc., \nstand out conspicuously and are in that way l=\r\ness dangerous. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \nJai Gurudev!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Si=\r\nva.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com=\r\n&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, \nrajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wro=\r\nte:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear \nSiva,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2 &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nice mail. \nHowever I have one issue with S=\r\nri Ravishankar.

I occasionally \nvisit this forum. I=\r\n happened to see several emails about AOL and the below email \nfrom Shri. N=\r\narasimha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual \npractices and=\r\n as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want to \nclarify a few=\r\n things to the extent of my understanding.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; There are several paths each leading to the destination of \nSat-Chit-=\r\nAnanda. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, some use devotion, \netc=\r\n. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. That does not ma=\r\nke \nit in any way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo would =\r\ncall it, \nit is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly emerge =\r\ninto \nSatChitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is transformed slowly an=\r\nd the \nsadhak radiates more and more as they progress more and more.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a seamless blend o=\r\nf Raja yoga, \nBhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in =\r\nAOL is not just \ndoing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)unde=\r\nrstood. Pranayams and \nSudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing and settling =\r\nof the mind and preparing \nfor meditation and doing other spiritual practic=\r\nes of contemplation, Seva for \nrest of the day wit the right attitude. Regu=\r\nlar practice of Sudarshan Kriya \nremoves / breaks old patterns and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; AOL \nincludes some yoga asanas to prepare the =\r\nbody (the Padma Sadhana sequence of \nasanas taught in DSN course and Sun Sa=\r\nlutations (Surya Namaskar) taught in Part \nII or advance courses fall under=\r\n this category.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; The raja yoga practic=\r\nes include all the pranayams, Sudarshan Kriya, mudras, \nbandhas, meditation=\r\ns taught in Art of Living course, advance courses, Sahaj \nsamadhi meditatio=\r\nn course, etc.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The \nKnowledge part inc=\r\nludes deep contemplative study and imbibing of Narada Bhakti \nSutras, Patan=\r\njali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat Gita. Sri Sri \nRavishankar h=\r\nas given very elaborate commentary on all of the above. His \ncommentary on =\r\nBhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and the publicly available \ncommentary=\r\n on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! Besides daily study \nof Y=\r\noga Vashishtam is highly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; recommended. Learning and \nconte=\r\nmplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for those that strive to become Art of=\r\n \nLiving teachers.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The path of AOL emp=\r\nhasises \non Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama sankeerta=\r\nn and bhajans \nare a standard feature of AOL satsangs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \nSome wonder why AOL charges for these courses and some wo=\r\nnder about lack of a \nSadhguru at every stage.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Let me clarify \nfrom my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishan=\r\nkar is a fully Enlightened \nMaster living in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is=\r\n capable of guiding millions of \ndevotees in every step of the sadhana with=\r\nout having to be near them in person. \nSeveral get necessary guidance in dr=\r\neams (I myself had that experience twice), \nsome in person and several via =\r\nvarious other ways. However, to get these \nguidance, an inner connection wi=\r\nth the Master is essential. Until that stage, \nthe various AOL courses, Sri=\r\n Sri&#39;s elaborate and in-depth commentaries on \nvarious Knowledge are more t=\r\nhan enough to guide disciples to a stage where \nconscious inner communion w=\r\nith Guru can be established.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Several =\r\nof the senior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) \nare yogis of a very =\r\nhigh order capable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness \nat will during =\r\nmeditation. They may be not fully established in it like Sri Sri, \nbut act =\r\nas channels of the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and \nwhen =\r\nneeded.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept \ntho=\r\nse that left their body as having achieved highest realization such as Sri =\r\n\nAurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ramana Maharishi. However it is a human te=\r\nndency \nto doubt them when they are in physical form.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its courses: AOL is world=\r\n&#39;s largest \nvolunteer run organization. Neither AOL teachers nor its founde=\r\nr Sri Sri \nRavishankar make monitory profits. All the proceeds go to the ch=\r\naritable \nactivities again run by volunteers. Many of the full time teacher=\r\ns have given up \nveyr lucrative careers and millions worth in property to b=\r\necome teachers and \nteach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neither needs all t=\r\nhe money. All senior AOL \nteachers including Sri Sri have went through very=\r\n bad and sometimes even \ndangerous conditions to bring the Knowledge to the=\r\n masses. This is a time when \nthe highest Knowledge needs to be revealed to=\r\n maximum number of people.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Senior AOL=\r\n teachers have faced danger to their \nlives by going without any help or gu=\r\nidance to areas infested with naxalites, \nterrorists in North East, Kashmir=\r\n, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. \nwith nothing but love and Divi=\r\nne Grace as their aid.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; As far as I kn=\r\now, money is charged in AOL courses for two \nreasons.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experience showed that \nthose that paid for the cou=\r\nrses seem to follow the practices more diligently. It \nis Sri Sri&#39;s guidanc=\r\ne that no deserving person should be denied a course because \nthey cannot a=\r\nfford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part of organizing several AOL \ncourses=\r\n and know first hand many cases where people took courses for free and \nwer=\r\ne also provided free accommodation, etc. Whenever natural disaster strikes,=\r\n \nAOL teachers go there paying from their own pocket or by AOL and teach co=\r\nurses \nfor free and provide healing to the victims. AOL does not advertise =\r\nit or make a \nshow of it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) This is m=\r\ny understanding and \nnot AOl position. It removes the Karmic debt to the AO=\r\nL teachers and volunteers \nwho still may have some doership in them.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \nFinally, Sri Sri is only interested in gett=\r\ning everyone turn inwards and express \nthe love, joy and compassion that is=\r\n inside everyone. As long as one follows a \npath, any path and surrenders t=\r\no any Sat Guru, we are happy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gur=\r\nudev!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \nSiva.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_03DD_01CA67D4.028D1AD0--\r\n\n"}}
