Do you recall an inst=\r\nance from his book when he goes to a \ncave to perform a sadhana and finds s=\r\nomewhere else there? After a brief \nargument, when the other sadhu would no=\r\nt budge,=C2=A0he dies! Similarly when Robert \nSvoboda does not acknowledge =\r\nVimalnanda during a TV interview, Vimalananda goes \nmad inspite of Robert t=\r\nrying to explain his reasons for not acknowledging him. \nVimalanada did not=\r\n like to draw attention to himself and secondly he was \nsick,=C2=A0and that=\r\n was the reason why Robert did not acknowledge any help he had \nreceived fr=\r\nom Vimalananda - to avoid people crowding at his door, but \nVimalananda cou=\r\nld not be pacified and had the TV transmission disabled at the \ntime the in=\r\nterview was going to be aired. Why was Vimalananda seeking \nacknowledgement=\r\n even when he claims he does not like public attention! Probably \ntransmiss=\r\nion breaking down was again part of divine will you think? Robert \nSbvoboda=\r\n himself mentions in the opening chapter that dealing with Vimalananda \nwas=\r\n impossible especially when one knows he is wrong but will never admit to h=\r\nis \nmistake.\n\nThen there was the story of his Senior Guru Maharaj has was d=\r\nenied audience by a \nsick sadhu. The senior guru maharaj is so insulted by =\r\nthis, he curses this ill \nsadhu with lifetime of that sickness and that sad=\r\nhu finally succumbs to that and \ndies! Now if I like to meet somebody and a=\r\nm denied audience, do I curse them to \ndeath?\n\nThe examples I give above do=\r\nes not illustrate a picture of people who were \ncompassionate and always wi=\r\nlling to forgive and forget. But still, they were \nhugely successful in the=\r\nir sadhana in their own way. And that is what we are \ntalking about here...=\r\n.the pre-requisite to success in sadhana. Nobody here I \nthinks expects to =\r\nacheive liberation repeating a few rounds of rosary for a \nparticular mantr=\r\na....but certianly what is required such that our sadhana \nproduces results=\r\n that are easily noticeable to us.
