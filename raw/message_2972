As time\npas=\r\nsed, the number of visitors increased and ladies with their children\nbegan =\r\nsitting there. The children naturally began to create some\nnuisance.Besides=\r\n that, from 1943 onwards, the number of visitors of all\ntypes increased sti=\r\nll more.\n\nMoreover, some poor ladies were coming with their children to pro=\r\nstrate and\nthe children were urinating there. The mothers do not get even a=\r\n cloth to\nwipe it out; and even if a cloth was given, some of the modern la=\r\ndies would\nnot take the trouble to clean the place. Therefore, Bhagavan=92s=\r\n attendants\nhad to clean it up.\n\nThey were tired and vexed at this and thou=\r\nght of preventing such uncivilised\npeople from coming into the hall. Bhagav=\r\nan, however, would not, under any\ncircumstances, agree to it.\n\nHence, they =\r\nbegan thinking of preventing ladies from sitting in the hall and\nmaking\narr=\r\nangements for their sitting in the verandah only.\n\nAt last, one day, they w=\r\nent to Bhagavan and told him that they would make\nseating\narrangements for =\r\nladies outside. Bhagavan thereupon asked why men should sit\nin the hall if =\r\nwomen could not sit there.\n\nThe attendants stated the difficulties they wer=\r\ne experiencing in looking\nafter the ladies that come and go. Bhagavan said,=\r\n =93What work is there in the\nhall even for Bhagavan? It will be all right =\r\nif he sits under the almond\ntree, which is opposite.\n\nThere will then be no=\r\n trouble or worry for anybody, whatever the children\nmay do.=94 When he sai=\r\nd that, they gave up all their attempts to isolate the\nladies.\n\nInstead, th=\r\ne window on one side was replaced by the door on the other side\nand vice-ve=\r\nrsa. After that, the ladies got their seating place opposite to\nBhagavan=92=\r\ns feet.\n\nA similar incident happened in 1946.The people used to wander abou=\r\nt the town\nand so when they came to Bhagavan=92s presence very much tired, =\r\nsome used to\nsquat on the floors with legs outstretched; some used to discu=\r\nss their\naffairs in loud voices and some used to lie down and snore.\n\nThat =\r\nused to happen between 12 noon and 2 p.m. Mothers used to sleep while\nbreas=\r\nt-feeding the children and the other children used to wander and play\nabout=\r\n everywhere.
