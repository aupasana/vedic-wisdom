As has been said before ad nauseum, to achieve specific material desires=\r\n one needs to be perfect in pronounciation and intonation, materials offere=\r\nd need to be pristine and all the rituals need to be followed precisely. An=\r\nd of course as Narasimha has emphasized the sadhak needs to be satwik and h=\r\nave some accumulated spiritual energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; My suggestion is do it with the=\r\n feeling of pleasing Lord Mahaganapthi. Do it for his pleasure. Do it for H=\r\nim to bestow His grace on you. Do it with an attitude of thankfulness for w=\r\nhat you have. Do it with the feeling of gratefulness for what you already p=\r\nosses for things can always be worse. And then sit back and watch as Lord M=\r\nahaganapthi showers his grace and blessings. If you cultivate the above att=\r\nitude consciously it will permeate your subconsciousness and your homam wil=\r\nl be that much more better. As one of the stalwart of our group Rajarshi ha=\r\ns aptly said keeping working persistently on your devotion to Mahaganapthi.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; God does not need our prayers, homas or japam. And He cannot be bribe=\r\nd either. But if performed with humility and loving devotion He might accep=\r\nt it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Not pontificating at all but I have been performing homas regula=\r\nrly for the last several months and can attest to the powerful effects on o=\r\nne&#39;s attitude, personality and overall thinking.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Alok.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Biswajit,\n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; If you keep doing Mahaganapati homas r=\r\negularly for a few months I am sure things will become better.
