The blood\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; pressure, jwara and headaches, all normalized.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In order to avoid =\r\nmis-conceptions in some readers, I want to expand the perspective here.\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; In some cases, intervention from a capable guru may indeed remove physic=\r\nal/material obstacles in one&#39;s life and sadhana. However, it depends on the=\r\n individual case. In some cases, some physical/material obstacles may have =\r\nto be presented to the sadhaka, in order to make one progress!\n&gt;  \n&gt; At the=\r\n end of the day, we have to remember that the goal of sadhana is not physic=\r\nal and material well-being. It is to overcome ego and its various aspects, =\r\nincluding attachment to physical and material well-being. However, as we do=\r\n sadhana using the physical body, which is sensitive to material conditions=\r\n around it, some level of physical and material well-being is necessary for=\r\n smooth sadhana and progress. However, at some stage or the other, one need=\r\ns to overcome those attachments. Depending on one&#39;s readiness and the condi=\r\ntioning one has, one may traverse a different path.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As an example, I =\r\nwill take the person whose first Kundalini awakening experience was describ=\r\ned in:\n&gt;  \n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/1476\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\nHe was being guided by a capable guru, who had actually told him ahead that=\r\n his time for Kundalini awakening had come. Yet, in the month or two after =\r\nthe experience, the person&#39;s health was bad. He was getting fever frequentl=\r\ny and feeling weak and weird. Now and then, he would experience flow of ele=\r\nctricity in the back, would lose awareness of the body and see sights and b=\r\neings or hear sounds, including mantras and beejas, all internally. It woul=\r\nd feel very nice. Suddenly, that experience would end and his normal body a=\r\nwareness would return. His attitude and internal reaction to what others sa=\r\nid about him changed drastically. He could see that he was making progress =\r\nand was generally happy. But his physical health was quite unstable and he =\r\nwas uncomfortable when he was aware of the physical body.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though he w=\r\nas worried a little in the beginning about it, he later stopped bothering a=\r\nbout physical health. He told himself that this was just one layer of reali=\r\nty and not the most important one and not worth worrying much. His focus tu=\r\nrned inwards.\n&gt;  \n&gt; After a few months of instability, his health became fi=\r\nne again. His nervous system perhaps reached a new equilibrium. His lifesty=\r\nle changed. He would eat much less food than before and yet feel energetic =\r\nenough.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If one experiences physical problems after taking up a sadhan=\r\na, one has three options: (1) stop the sadhana, (2) look for ways to improv=\r\ne the problem, (3) try to overcome physical concerns and rise above the bod=\r\ny. Differebt persons may approach differently, based on their readiness.\n&gt; =\r\n \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, J=\r\nyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitr=\r\ni Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films =\r\nthat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http=\r\n://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; ----------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- Dr Satya Prakash &lt;backtocosmic=\r\nroots@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha garu,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Welcome to=\r\n the list and it is a pleasure to have your &gt;&gt;&gt;learned &gt;&gt;&gt;company here.&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank you.

As I already wrote in an earlier post, &quot;there will be=\r\n varied beliefs and opinions ranging from the very rigid traditional extrem=\r\ne to the very liberal and casual new-age extreme based on one&#39;s personal af=\r\nfiliations, family and cultural influences&quot;.   Neither of us is at the libe=\r\nral/casual extreme nor the very rigid traditional extreme. Both of us seem =\r\nto be somewhere in the middle though at different points.   \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;If one reaches samadhi directly when Kundalini awakens, things &gt;&gt;&gt;ar=\r\ne fine. But, that may not &gt;&gt;happen. &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Kundalini can take many different p=\r\naths and go to different places. Depending on the &gt;&gt;&gt;impurities in various =\r\nnadis, various experiences are possible. If a sadhaka is unprepared to hand=\r\nle &gt;&gt;&gt;the experience, it can create &gt;&gt;&gt;problems. One can experience somethi=\r\nng nice and become proud and &gt;&gt;&gt;egoistic and get stuck there. One can exper=\r\nience a very fierce form of divine and get scared to death &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;or go mad. M=\r\nany &gt;&gt;&gt;possibilities are there.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Excellent point. Here I w=\r\nill share something from my own experience to illustrate this. Initially I =\r\nwas hesitant to write about it, but decided to go ahead as it might help pu=\r\nt things in a better perspective. During 1989-1992, I pursued sadhana singl=\r\ne-mindedly as a brahmachari, having given up other secular studies. Those d=\r\nays I used to live mostly in the company of brahmacharis and sanyasis. Some=\r\n of my co-sadhakas of those days went on to become fully ordained monks lat=\r\ner. Swadhyaya, yogabhyasa and occasional tirthayatras formed the mainstay o=\r\nf my sadhana at this time. Somewhere towards the second half of this period=\r\n I started doing Devi Mahatmya parayana on my own without any initiation. T=\r\nhings were fine and I made some progress probably owing to a combination of=\r\n many factors. After spending three years in spiritual studies and sadhana,=\r\n I decided to return home and pursue medical studies in accordance with my =\r\nmother&#39;s wish. However I continued with my sadhana whilst pursuing my medic=\r\nal studies too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Around early 95, I started doing Devi Mahatmya par=\r\nayana with *more* vigour. Within a month I started having piercing headache=\r\ns, my body would be quite hot to touch and my blood pressure would shoot up=\r\n to around 150/110 on and off. After conducting the standard investigations=\r\n, Dr. Rao from the Dept of Medicine, who had already taken a liking to me, =\r\nsuspected that it *might* have something to do with my sadhanas too. Things=\r\n continued to be the same for some more months, till I got introduced to Sw=\r\nami Sachchidananda in what seemed to be a chance meeting. During the course=\r\n of conversation Swamiji asked me to meet him alone the next day after comi=\r\nng to know about my practice of the Devi mahatmya parayana. After interacti=\r\nng everyday for a week Swamiji initiated me properly into Sri Sri Chandi pa=\r\nth.  After a week or so after the initiation all the symptoms subsided. The=\r\n blood pressure, jwara and headaches, all normalized. It has been around 15=\r\n years since then and none of the symptoms have recurred. What&#39;s more, I ha=\r\nd some very powerful internal experiences in quick succession during the fo=\r\nllowing week itself after initiation. This is my experience.\n&gt; &gt;           =\r\n                       \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;(6) If one is not looking for any speci=\r\nfic results and doing a &gt;&gt;&gt;mantra just for spiritual progress with a &gt;&gt;&gt;sen=\r\nse of surrender, one is safe.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Right from the start whatev=\r\ner sadhanas I did, were all done largely as a spiritual pursuit only with n=\r\no specific results in mind at least consciously. However the general desire=\r\n to make progress would have naturally been there.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; (5) Es=\r\npecially if one does not engage in raja yoga/hatha yoga &gt;&gt;&gt;practices that a=\r\nre meant to forcefully &gt;&gt;&gt;awaken and raise Kundalini &gt;&gt;&gt;and if one does not=\r\n consciously think in terms of &gt;&gt;&gt;raising Kundalini, one is &gt;&gt;&gt;safe.&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Though I was not consciously thinking of raising Kundalni or an=\r\nything like that and was just focusing on sadhana, you are right about the =\r\nraja yoga/hatha yoga practices. Yogabhyasa was a regular part of my sadhana=\r\n during 89-92. In fact I became a qualified Yogacharya during this time. Ho=\r\nwever Devi Mahatmya parayana was part of my sadhana along with yogabhyasa s=\r\nince early 91-92 during which time things were fine. It was only in 94 that=\r\n I resumed Devi Mahatmya parayana more seriously. Of course I was doing my =\r\nyogabhyasa too at this time. I have already written about the rest.  \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; My stance regarding the role of initiation stems from my own experience=\r\n as well as the instructions coming down through the guru parampara. Howeve=\r\nr I can appreciate your stance as well. Let me add something more here. No =\r\ntwo individuals have the same experience in such matters. Some may experien=\r\nce nothing significant after initiation and may still be progressing. Some =\r\nmay need more guidance due to the nature of the specific practices that the=\r\ny have got into. Eitherways She will take care.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nGiven this statement, the difference of opinion between us are very subtle.=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is better for all of us to focus more on the underlyi=\r\nng unity of our thought and not on the difference. Moreover overstretching =\r\nsuch discussions can deter some sadhakas which is not something that anyone=\r\n of us would wish for.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;  &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; One word on guilt here. If some=\r\none is doing a practice and feels a sense of guilt, it blocks the &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;pract=\r\nice from working &gt;&gt;&gt;effectively. Please do whatever sadhana you do, without=\r\n a sense of guilt. If &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;you have the sense of guilt, work on overcoming i=\r\nt. If &gt;&gt;&gt;you cannot overcome it, it may be a good &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;idea to find a &gt;&gt;&gt;sad=\r\nhana with which you feel comfortable and have no sense of guilt.&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I agree that there are many good sadhakas doing Sri Sri Chandipath w=\r\nithout initiation. There is no need for anyone to feel guilty. It is only g=\r\nood samskaras and vasanas that attract a sadhaka to Sri Sri Chandi. One doe=\r\ns not need to feel guilty for worshipping or loving the Goddess.  If you ta=\r\nke my own example, initially I did the sadhana without initiation. It is on=\r\nly Her Grace that I was initiated. I didn&#39;t even ask for it. If it is meant=\r\n to be it will be. Things will happen on their own accord in the natural fl=\r\now. The main thing is that the sadhaka should leave the rest to the compass=\r\nionate Goddess and trust that She will take care of everything.            =\r\n       \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; On this note I suggest that we should wrap up the topic of=\r\n initiation. From my side I wish to say nothing more. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I might be =\r\noff the list till another fortnight or so as I am travelling.\n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; All Glories to the Goddess!!!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Satya Prakash   \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- I=\r\nn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Namaste Satya Prakash garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Welcome to the list and it is a =\r\npleasure to have your learned company here.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Traditional conve=\r\nntions are not without basis, but I suggest we need to understand their mot=\r\nivation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When one chants lo=\r\nng prayers such as Chandipath, Vishnu sahasra naama stotra, Aditya Hridayam=\r\n etc, it requires a lot of conscious mental activity. One mostly cannot go =\r\ninto samadhi while chanting them (though there can be exceptions). On the o=\r\nther hand, when one chants Gayatri mantra or ashtakshari mantra or dwadasak=\r\nshari mantra or panchakshari mantra or navarna mantra or various beeja mant=\r\nras or other small mantras, it requires a minimal amount of conscious menta=\r\nl activity. With repetitive and minimal mental activity, there is a possibi=\r\nlity of momentary cessation of mental activity and entering samadhi OR awak=\r\nening of Kundalini and progress towards samadhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one reach=\r\nes samadhi directly when Kundalini awakens, things are fine. But, that may =\r\nnot happen. Kundalini can take many different paths and go to different pla=\r\nces. Depending on the impurities in various nadis, various experiences are =\r\npossible. If a sadhaka is unprepared to handle the experience, it can creat=\r\ne problems. One can experience something nice and become proud and egoistic=\r\n and get stuck there. One can experience a very fierce form of divine and g=\r\net scared to death or go mad. Many possibilities are there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhus, practices that can truly awaken one were kept limited to the initiated=\r\n. Guru would assess the progress and readiness of a sadhaka and initiate on=\r\ne when one is ready.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Howeve=\r\nr, there are a few things that are different in today&#39;s times:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; (1) There are very few people who are ready to experience something. Most=\r\n people will just do sadhana, burn some basic blocking karmas and not reall=\r\ny experience much. At most, some people will experience an awakening and ju=\r\nst a little movement of Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) There are very few gurus who a=\r\nre indeed capable of assessing and guiding a sadhaka well. Most initiations=\r\n are a mere formality.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) With the insistence on initiation etc, we =\r\nmay be blocking, in the coming years, the very few sadhakas who MAY actuall=\r\ny achieve some progress with a mantra, from even trying it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (4) If a =\r\nsadhaka surrenders and has the attitude of &quot;I do not know the right way. I =\r\nam just doing what I am capable of. Please take care of me Mother&quot;, none of=\r\n the risks I mentioned above will really apply.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Especially if one=\r\n does not engage in raja yoga/hatha yoga practices that are meant to forcef=\r\nully awaken and raise Kundalini and if one does not consciously think in te=\r\nrms of raising Kundalini, one is safe.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (6) If one is not looking for =\r\nany specific results and doing a mantra just for spiritual progress with a =\r\nsense of surrender, one is safe.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Apart from assessing the readiness, there are some more functions per=\r\nformed by an initiating guru:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (1) A guru can jumpstart one&#39;s =\r\nsadhana with a mantra and results can come faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, t=\r\nhis expects a guru of some caliber and achievement with the mantra. After a=\r\nll, if one wants a one-on-one audience with Sachin Tendulkar or Roger Feder=\r\ner or Barack Obama, being introduced to them by someone they know and someo=\r\nne that had a one-on-one audience with them earlier can be helpful (instead=\r\n of introducing by oneself). If someone who merely read more about them but=\r\n is not any closer to them tries to introduce you to them, will it even get=\r\n their attention?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now-a-days, most people do not have access =\r\nto gurus who have experienced the divine with a mantra. Such people are ver=\r\ny rare. One&#39;s best bet is to do sadhana by oneself, using all the tools giv=\r\nen by rishis and various spiritual masters. When one is ready (and if it is=\r\n needed), a guru may come and take one&#39;s sadhana to the next level.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) A guru can mould the correct attitude in sadhaka before a sadhan=\r\na is taken up.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, there are sadhakas initiated in power=\r\nful mantras and not having the right attitude. For example, I know people i=\r\nnitiated into Bagalamukhi mantra and trying to use it to win litigation. If=\r\n one does not know that a &quot;Mahavidya&quot; (supreme knowledge) is for overcoming=\r\n conditioning and realizing self and not for winning court cases, one&#39;s ini=\r\ntiation is no good.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; On the other hand, I know some people not=\r\n formally initiated into Chandipath, but doing Chandi homam daily with sapt=\r\nashati and also navarna mantra. I know that they do not have any specific m=\r\naterial goals and are overcoming the few desires that were originally there=\r\n at the back of the mind. The are making quick progress spiritually and the=\r\nir thinking is getting transformed nicely. Despite having no formal initiat=\r\nion, aren&#39;t they worshipping Chandi as a Mahavidya?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomlin=\r\ne is that one can mould one&#39;s own attitude through a formal initiation or t=\r\nhrough reading scriptures, satsanga and constant contemplation. One thing m=\r\nay work better in one case and another thing in another case.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n (3) A guru can teach the correct procedure of a sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; How=\r\never, role of procedural correctness in success is a higher in sadhanas for=\r\n specific results than sadhana for spiritual progress. I maintain that the =\r\nart of getting specific results from sadhanas is being hidden more and more=\r\n as Kali progresses, for a reason. I suggest that it is useless to even thi=\r\nnk in those terms and pursue it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Mantras like navarna mantra =\r\ncan just be meditated on, without any specific procedure. When one is ready=\r\n and pure enough, they can give one an experience of the divine. Mantras li=\r\nke Siddha Kunjika stotra, that codify several specific sadhanas to get spec=\r\nific results, are anyway inaccessible to most people of this age! They are =\r\nonly available in codified form and gurus who can decode them will keep dis=\r\nappearing more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nFor those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi path without initiation, the=\r\nre is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; no need to worry or be confused. ... Please keep doing whatev=\r\ner you are doing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Given this statement, the difference of opi=\r\nnion between us are very subtle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One word on guilt here. If s=\r\nomeone is doing a practice and feels a sense of guilt, it blocks the practi=\r\nce from working effectively. Please do whatever sadhana you do, without a s=\r\nense of guilt. If you have the sense of guilt, work on overcoming it. If yo=\r\nu cannot overcome it, it may be a good idea to find a sadhana with which yo=\r\nu feel comfortable and have no sense of guilt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Things will =\r\nhappen on their own accord in the natural flow. Leave the rest to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nhe compassionate Goddess.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; That&#39;s the bottomline. Even if one =\r\nwere initiated, it would be quite difficult to not leave things to the Godd=\r\ness and make things happen as one wanted. Start sadhana with some level of =\r\nsurrender. Then, sadhana will help increase the level of surrender. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nagraj garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The op=\r\ninion referred to in your question 2 is not without basis. But again, we ne=\r\ned to understand the motivation to put it in the right perspective.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one experiences divine through sadhana with Gayatri mantra (or an=\r\ny mantra), then it is easy for one to experience divine with another mantra=\r\n. One can just pick up a mantra, do it and experience relatively quickly.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However, if one was merely initiated in Gayatri mantra (or any=\r\n mantra) and did not really make much spiritual progress with it, that does=\r\n not place one in any kind of advantage when it comes to sadhana with anoth=\r\ner mantra. That is my opinion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  =\r\n                 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      Films that make =\r\na difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      Spirituality: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@&gt;=\r\n wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Dr. Satya Prakash, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I do see your p=\r\noints and do understand that Sankara peethams discourage the practise of ma=\r\nhavidyas without the Initiation. But here are a couple of questions. Since =\r\nyou seem to be deeply knowledgeable, please clarify these questions. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.

I heard from one of the pundits that since Ga=\r\nyatri Mantra is considered the greatest of all mantras, one who has initiat=\r\nion in Gayatri Mantra (which is given as part of upanayanam) need not have =\r\nany other initiation. You could give your valuable opinion on the same. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nagraj  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- D=\r\nr Satya Prakash &lt;backtocosmicroots@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially I agree with Narasimha garu in most matters in this=\r\n discussion. The only major point where I disagree is whether one can do Sr=\r\ni Sri Chandi path *without initiation*. The rest of the confusion on transl=\r\nation of mantras needs some clarification as there seems to be some unneces=\r\nsary confusion. A few pointers:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1.\tThere are various sacre=\r\nd chants embedded within the Vedas, Puranas, Agamas etc. Broadly speaking s=\r\nuch sacred chants can be categorised as mantras, stotras, kavachas, dhyanam=\r\ns etc. Some stotras too are also treated as mahamantras and mantras.  The S=\r\namhita portion of the Vedas too is referred to as mantras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; 2.\tUndoubtedly mantras and stotras have to be chanted in the original. Re=\r\nading a translation is not even comparable to chanting the original chant. =\r\nSo far it is fine.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3.\tWhilst mantra, stotra and kavacha ar=\r\ne all based on Sabda/Vak, tradition makes a distinction between them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;      \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4.\tAs per the traditional view one doesn&#39;t need to be init=\r\niated to chant a stotra or dhyanam. The case is not the same with most mant=\r\nras. Mantras containing bijaksharas, agamic mantras, mantras of Mahavidyas =\r\netc need initiation. This is the traditional view. Mantras from the Veda Sa=\r\nmhita are not the same as these other mantras that need initiation, which a=\r\nre generally referred to as Agamic/Tantrik mantras. Whatever you call these=\r\n mantras the actual idea is that these mantras are integral parts of larger=\r\n and distinct spiritual specialities that need initiation, as in the case o=\r\nf Mahavidyas such as Kali or Sri.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5.\tVishnusahasranama, S=\r\nivasahasranama, Aditya hrdayam etc do not need initiation as they fall unde=\r\nr stotra category only. Lalitasahasranama and Devi Mahatmyam are traditiona=\r\nlly viewed not MERELY as stotras or parts of puranas. They have a larger st=\r\natus as integral parts of a Mahavidya sadhana. Chanting them without initia=\r\ntion is not recommended especially when the reader combines the navarna or =\r\nshodashi mantras too as an integral part of the chanting.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;          =\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6.\tI know from personal interaction that acharyas belonging to b=\r\noth Kanchi as well as Sringeri paramparas recommend initiation for both the=\r\n sadhanas of Sri Sri Chandi and Sri Vidya along with their respective NAVAK=\r\nSHARI AND SHODASAKSHARI mantras which are treated as an INTEGRAL LIMB (ANGA=\r\n) of the sadhana. Acharyas of both these traditions hold that one needs to =\r\nbe initiated to chant the Navarna as well as shodashakshari mantras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 7.\tRecapping my earlier stance, Devi Mahatmyam is a great text =\r\nthat has an independent status by itself as part of a Mahavidya. It is simu=\r\nltaneously a Mahavidya, a Yogasastra as well as an Advaitic text in the spi=\r\nrit of the Upanishads. ***As a Mahavidya the Navakshari is an integral part=\r\n of Sri Sri Chandi path***. Thus tradition holds that one needs to be initi=\r\nated to chant it. However if one wishes to benefit from the Yoga-Vedanta or=\r\n Sacred myth aspects of the Devi Mahatmyam, , reading the sacred myth in th=\r\ne vernacular has been recommended in my write-up, as chanting the original =\r\nalong with the navakshari  amounts to practicing the sadhana of a Mahavidya=\r\n. In that case it is recommended to be initiated and go through the special=\r\nised sadhanas properly under guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 8.\tArguably if an =\r\nuninitiated person reads the Devi Mahatmyam in the original Sanskrit as par=\r\nt of the *Pauranik* approach and not as a Mahavidya, it has an inherent pro=\r\nblem in our times.  The problem with attempting to do a parayana of Devi Ma=\r\nhatmyam from texts alone (without initiation) is that most readers inadvert=\r\nently end up also chanting the Navarna mantra or stotras such as the Siddha=\r\nkunjika stotram which too contain the bijaksharas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 9.\tI y=\r\nou carefully peruse my write-up on the Devi Mahatmyam, forget translating, =\r\nnowhere do I put down the Navarna mantra even in writing. Neither have I at=\r\ntempted to write a commentary on it. Translations of mantras do not have th=\r\ne power of the original mantra as Sabda or Vak. However it is recommended t=\r\no know the essence or import (artha) of the mantra and its sadhana while ch=\r\nanting it. Infact `artha&#39; is the import, the essence of `Vak&#39;, not a transl=\r\nation! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 10.\tFor those who are already doing Sri Sri Chandi=\r\n path without initiation, there is no need to worry or be confused. There h=\r\nas to be a certain level of samskara to be attracted to Sri Sri Chandi path=\r\n itself. We all have it. Otherwise we would not be doing it (initiation or =\r\nno initiation). Please keep doing whatever you are doing. Just be cautious =\r\nnot to do sakama sadhana. As Narasimha garu has rightly pointed out it is b=\r\netter to just do the sadhana WITHOUT asking for any favours or results. Tha=\r\nt attitude itself will reduce a lot of the potential problem. Things will h=\r\nappen on their own accord in the natural flow. Leave the rest to the compas=\r\nsionate Goddess.              \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hope the above pointers hel=\r\np in clearing any confusion.  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Satya Prak=\r\nash                \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, h ramalingam &lt;hramalingam@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I want to share one anecdote happened in f=\r\nront of Kanchi Maha Sannidanam Sri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Chandrasekara Bharathi Swa=\r\nmigal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Swamigal was staying in a camp near Mysore in Karnatak=\r\na One day all the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; learned persons male and female alike\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n requested Swamigal to translate Sri Vishnu SahasraNamam in kannada languag=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so that they can chant knowing the meaning fully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Swa=\r\nmigal didn&#39;t reply to this request which was made early in the morning.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Later in the day after the days pooja etc were over as usual Postman=\r\n came to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; camp to deliver the posts came to Kanchi Mutt Swamigal. =\r\nSwamigal was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seriously looking at the cover\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in front of=\r\n the learned members and was looking at one line written as PIN\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; C=\r\node and followed by six numbers.

That is definitely the ideal situation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If=\r\n that is not possible, what I am saying is that reading something\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; composed by an elevated being even without understanding the meaning is =\r\nvery\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; useful. Suppose someone does not understand what Ganapathi=\r\n Atharvaseersham\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; means, thinks in general that it extols Ganapa=\r\nthi as the source of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything and chants it with a sense of s=\r\nurrender to Ganapathi. One can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; still benefit immensely. If one =\r\nis not experiencing anything, it is more\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; likely because one doe=\r\ns not have the correct attitude and surrender and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; probably not =\r\nbecause one does know the specific meaning of Ganapathi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Atharva=\r\nseersham. Many people knowing the meaning and chanting may also\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n experience nothing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The words uttered by a realize=\r\nd soul have meanings at many layers and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; literal meaning is only=\r\n one superficial layer. Some important layers are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lost in trans=\r\nlation. The most important layers of meaning are never\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understo=\r\nod intellectually, but only experienced internally.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Whether you know the meaning or not, chant the mantra with a calm and\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; relaxed mind and with devotion and surrender. Many people keep a ta=\r\nrget\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; count and race through it or do it mechanically with a sen=\r\nse of duty. If it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is done even with a little bit of love and su=\r\nrrender to the deity, it can do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something. The key to success w=\r\nith a mantra is calmness of the mind. If a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind is filled with =\r\nthousands of thoughts and chanting of the mantra is just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one of=\r\n those thousand activities, nothing will happen. If most thoughts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; subside and mind is essentially reverberating with a mantra, that is whe=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one experiences a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are 4=\r\n levels of sabda. When one says a mantra, physical vibration is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n accompanied in other layers by the imagery in the mind, the thoughts and\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instincts in the conscious and sub-conscious mind etc. Some mant=\r\nras composed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by (or revealed to) great rishis/yogis (essentiall=\r\ny beings with very stable\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and calm minds) are designed such tha=\r\nt the physical vibration of the mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can eventually cause the=\r\n corresponding imagery in the mind by resonance,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when other men=\r\ntal activity subsides. Thus, after repeating the mantra and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cal=\r\nming the mind down, you can recreate a certain imagery and thought system\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in your mind. That can permanently alter the way your mind workd=\r\n.

So, I suggest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not worrying about whether one un=\r\nderstands or not and reading Sanskrit\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras coming from great=\r\n rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If I were to give an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a bats=\r\nman may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; read a lot of scholarly analysis on how to play shots, =\r\nhow to see the ball\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from the hand of the bowler, how to move fe=\r\net, how get into the line of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ball, how to play it with a st=\r\nraight bat, when to play front foot and when\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to play back foot =\r\netc. But that does not necessarily make one a good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; batsman. If =\r\none practices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n basic understanding of principles is needed. But, above that, practice is\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; more important than bookish knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, some conceptual understanding is important in spirituality\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; also, but above that, sadhana is more important.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The essence of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all =\r\npaths is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very simple. It is that we should overcome the notions=\r\n that we are doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; things and realize that the divine acts thro=\r\nugh all of us. The divine acts\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; through each being based on one&#39;=\r\ns conditioning and gives corresponding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reactions. One goes thro=\r\nugh the cycle until one overcomes the notions of &quot;I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; am doing&quot;, =\r\n&quot;this is mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike that&quot; etc. Though this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; is the essence of all scriptures and one knows it, one may be deluded ag=\r\nain\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and again. There is no magic formula to internalize this un=\r\nderstanding fully\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and overcome the instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;=\r\nthis is mine&quot; etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, even if one practices a =\r\nmantra that one does not intellectually\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; understand, that is ok.=\r\n As long as the basic essence of scriptures is at the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back of o=\r\nne&#39;s mind, one is constantly contemplating and watching over one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; own thoughts and instincts, to root out undesirable thoughts, one&#39;s sad=\r\nhana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will yield results.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. I=\r\nt is fine to read\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; scriptures and other books. It is fine to mee=\r\nt spiritual people (physically\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; or virtually, like here) and dis=\r\ncuss good things. But that will only create\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a theoretical under=\r\nstanding. For it to be internalized and to govern all of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s =\r\ninstincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One doing sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding of w=\r\nhat is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what and what we want, is like a blind person running ar=\r\nound a mountain,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; instead of climbing it. One not doing sadhana,=\r\n but having an excellent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; theoretical understanfing, is like a p=\r\nerson who knows that he needs to climb\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mountain, but keeps =\r\nstaring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding the statement that initiation =\r\nis important in tantric path but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not in Vedic path, I want to a=\r\ndd my 2 cents.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether Vedic and tantrik paths =\r\nare two *distinct* paths or parts of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continuum is debatable. =\r\nThere are a lot of inaccurate notions today.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s attitude and\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material results needs =\r\nto be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; careful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of k=\r\narmas to affect a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; particular result is not easy. It requires su=\r\npervision of a good guru and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not many are left anyway. On the o=\r\nther hand, if one is NOT looking for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific material results =\r\nand is looking for spiritual progress, the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; constraints are fewe=\r\nr and options more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some may sub-consciously ha=\r\nve a notion that Tantrik path is for begetting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; specific materia=\r\nl results and Vedic path is for self-realization. That is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; incor=\r\nrect. After all, one in the Vedic path may chant Manyu sooktam for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam for longevity, and so on.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gross substance in an =\r\nelaborate\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ritual to reinforce the notion that &quot;all is Brahman&quot; =\r\nand to remove the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental repulsion towards some objects.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My thumbrule is thi=\r\ns. If you are looking for a specific material result,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you need =\r\nclear guidance and supervision, which not many are capable of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; g=\r\niving today! Instead, if you want spiritual progress and an increase of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your surrender, you can just keep doing sadhana without initiation=\r\n or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guidance. Just keep company of scriptures and other like-mi=\r\nnded people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; After all, if you want to go to Ca=\r\nlcutta, you need clear and precise\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; directions and some supervis=\r\nion. If you just want to go to north pole, you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can keep walking=\r\n towards north. Of course, having supervision helps there\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too, =\r\nbut you can do without it!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
