Klostermaier\n\n&quot;The Vedic Way of Knowing God&quot; is obviously a work that h=\r\nas grown over many years. While focused on Jiva Goswami&#39;s epistemology, it =\r\nis much more than a conventional scholarly study of a particular Indian the=\r\nologian. It shows wide erudition and personal engagement, it is a critical =\r\nstudy as well as a statement of faith. Embedding Jiva Goswami&#39;s writings in=\r\n the entire range of Hindu sacred literature the work shows at one and the =\r\nsame time Jiva&#39;s connectedness with the sanatana dharma and his originality=\r\n as a critic of some of this tradition&#39;s more extreme representatives.\n\nSri=\r\n Dharma Pravartaka Acharya (Dr. Frank Morales) is aware of the problems tha=\r\nt Jiva&#39;s writings present, his apparent contradictions and the unresolved q=\r\nuestions concerning the meaning of the Veda. Better than anyone before him,=\r\n he discloses Jiva&#39;s uncertainties and non-sequiturs. But he also shows how=\r\n one can at one and the same time avoid Jiva&#39;s obvious sectarian biases and=\r\n appreciate his genuine contribution to the hermeneutics of the Vedic corpu=\r\ns, based on a Puranic tradition. \n\nWhile focusing on Jiva&#39;s epistemology th=\r\ne Acharya provides a summary not only of Hindu, but also of Buddhist philos=\r\nophy and defines Jiva&#39;s place within the Indian tradition. Since shabda, &quot;t=\r\nhe divine word&quot; plays such a decisive role in Jiva&#39;s system the Acharya&#39;s o=\r\nbservations on its nature and importance, are both profound and timely. The=\r\ny are certainly relevant also for other theological traditions.\n\nOne of the=\r\n aims of this book is to get European and American philosophers interested =\r\nin India&#39;s rich philosophical tradition. By showing his familiarity with We=\r\nstern philosophy, Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya acts as a bridge-builder be=\r\ntween East and West. He also insists on the importance of &quot;doing philosophy=\r\n&quot;, i.e. showing the actual relevance of what is being discussed. The wide r=\r\nange of knowledge of Eastern as well as Western philosophy displayed in the=\r\n book should make it attractive even to those who so far have not been expo=\r\nsed to Indian thought. The author&#39;s personal engagement constitutes by and =\r\nin itself a philosophical undertaking of considerable weight. \n\nI hope and =\r\nwish that this book would find many readers to continue the debate it initi=\r\nates. \n\nMay the &quot;The Vedic Way of Knowing God&quot; be heard and followed by see=\r\nkers in East and West!\n\nDr. Klaus K. Klostermaier, FRSC\nDistinguished Profe=\r\nssor Emeritus\nUniversity of Manitoba\nWinnipeg, MB, Canada\nJanuary, 2010\n\n\n\n=\r\n&quot;The Vedic Way of Knowing God&quot;, by Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya, is availa=\r\nble for purchase here:\n\nhttp://www.lulu.com/product/paperback/the-vedic-way=\r\n-of-knowing-god/13555030\n\nGive the gift of Dharma this holiday season.  5% =\r\nDiscount if you purchase now!\n\n\nRevealing the profound philosophical insigh=\r\nts of the world&#39;s most ancient spiritual philosophy, this book not only bol=\r\ndly answers the question &quot;How do I know God?&quot; from the distinctly Vedic (Hi=\r\nndu) perspective, but also explores the further issues of what it even mean=\r\ns to be able to know God. With greater detail than any other book ever writ=\r\nten to date, it reveals the precise mystical mechanisms employed for knowin=\r\ng the Divine; the psychological conditions\nnecessary for such a spiritual e=\r\nndeavor; the transformative cognitive\nexperiences that occur within the spi=\r\nritual practitioner upon achieving God-realization; the integral relationsh=\r\nip between transcendent Word, spiritually revealed literature, and the impo=\r\nrtant role of living teachers; and the vast implications of the Vedic world=\r\n-view on contemporary global philosophy and religion. If you have ever aske=\r\nd the question &quot;How do I know God?&quot;, this is the book that will give you th=\r\ne precise road-map!\n\n\n&quot;The Vedic Way of Knowing God&quot;, by Sri Dharma Pravart=\r\naka Acharya\n\n\nPLEASE FORWARD THIS TO ALL SINCERE SPIRITUAL SEEKERS.\n\n\n\n"}}
