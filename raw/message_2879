Actually, this is just =\r\none of the five differences that are so stated -- all five differences that=\r\n constitute the universe are eternal.

Parama-s=\r\nhruti, as quoted by Ananda T=C3=AErtha in his &#39;VishNu-tattva-vinirNaya&#39; \nTh=\r\nis is the reason why some refer to the doctrine of Tattvav=C3=A2da (the pre=\r\nferred name) as &#39;Dvaita&#39;. However, &#39;Dvaita&#39; is thought to be inadequately r=\r\nepresentative of the true grain of Tattvav=C3=A2da. \nThe doctrine of Tattva=\r\nv=C3=A2da is considered to be eternal (in a flow-like sense, just as Creati=\r\non is eternal); in historical times, it was revived by Ananda T=C3=AErtha, =\r\nwho is also known as Madhv=C3=A2ch=C3=A2rya. Because of this, followers of =\r\nTattvav=C3=A2da are called M=C3=A2dhvas, meaning followers of Madhva. \nWhat=\r\n is &quot;Dvaita&quot;?\nDvaita, or M=C3=A2dhva siddh=C3=A2nta, is the name for the do=\r\nctrine of Vedanta that asserts the eternal and immutable difference between=\r\n the individual soul, or jiiva, and the Supreme Lord, or Iishvara (also kno=\r\nwn as Vishnu).\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nIsn&#39;t Dvaita the mere opposite of Advaita?\nSuc=\r\nh misperception is one of the reasons why some reject the use of &#39;Dvaita&#39; t=\r\no refer to the doctrine of Tattvav=C3=A2da. While it is true that Advaita a=\r\nnd Tattvav=C3=A2da have had many debates over hundreds of years, and that t=\r\nhe latter denies the jagan-mithyatva (illusory nature of the universe) that=\r\n is one of the fundamental tenets of Advaita, it is certainly not the case =\r\nthat there is disagreement everywhere, nor is it the case that one can deri=\r\nve Tattvav=C3=A2da merely by taking the opposite of everything claimed by A=\r\ndvaita. But it can be said with full certainty that on most fundamental iss=\r\nues such as the nature of =C3=8Eshvara, j=C3=AEva, attainment of mukti, etc=\r\n., the two have total and irreconcilable differences.\nEven so, the doctrine=\r\ns are not polar reciprocals in the conventional sense=E2=80=94it is not the=\r\n case that they assert logically opposite tenets at every point.\nIsn&#39;t Dvai=\r\nta the first step towards learning Advaita?\nIf it is, then it is a quite la=\r\nrge, reverse, first step! While adherents of Advaita say that by nature and=\r\n everyday experience one believes in the reality of the universe, etc., and=\r\n that such belief must be got rid if one is to attain complete union with t=\r\nhe nirguNa-Brahman, no serious scholar of Advaita claims that studying Tatt=\r\nvav=C3=A2da is a first step towards learning Advaita. For one thing, it is =\r\na rule of all learning that things learned first must not contradict things=\r\n learned later; for another, Tattvav=C3=A2da specifically examines and deno=\r\nunces many Advaita concepts, and hence, one who has learned Tattvav=C3=A2da=\r\n first cannot possibly accept Advaita later. In fact Advaita has not built =\r\nup a credible system of analysis where the p=C3=BBrva paksha or the initial=\r\n proposition of Tattvav=C3=A2da is examined and rejected thereby establishi=\r\nng Advaita.

Who else is one except th=\r\ne tenth man, both when one is anxiously searching (for the tenth man) and w=\r\nhen one finds oneself (to be the tenth man).\n\nSri Bhagavan says that even t=\r\nhis is not true, because nonduality (advaita) is always the truth and duali=\r\nty (dvaita) is always unreal. That is, the one non-dual=C2=A0Self alone exi=\r\nsts and is real=C2=A0even when in the ignorant outlook of the individual it=\r\n seems to appear as this unreal world of duality and diversity.\n\nIn order t=\r\no emphasis that duality is unreal even during the time of its seeming exist=\r\nence, Sri Bhagavan cites the parable of the =E2=80=98lost=E2=80=99 tenth ma=\r\nn.=C2=A0Ten foolish men forded a river, and on reaching the other side they=\r\n wished to make sure that all had crossed safely. So all of them began to c=\r\nount the number of persons on the shore, but since each one forgot to count=\r\n himself, they all counted only nine. Believing that one of their companion=\r\ns must have drowned, they all began to weep, until a passing wayfarer who u=\r\nnderstood the situation asked each one to count himself, whereupon they rea=\r\nlized that they were always ten men, both during the time of their seeming =\r\nloss and after their =E2=80=98finding=E2=80=99 the missing man. Similarly, =\r\nwhen we attain Self-knowledge we will realize that non-duality (advaita) is=\r\n always the sole truth,both during the time of our seeming ignorance (when =\r\nnonduality appears to be lost and duality appears to prevail) and after our=\r\n\n =E2=80=98attaining=E2=80=99 Self, the non-dual reality.\n\nIt is to be note=\r\nd here that, though non-duality is the truth even during the time of seemin=\r\ng ignorance, this does not mean that no spiritual practice (sadhana) is nec=\r\nessary,as some theoreticians/ theorists have wrongly concluded.So long as t=\r\nhe tenth man appears to be lost, it is necessary for each one of the ten to=\r\n enquire and find out =E2=80=98Who is lost?=E2=80=99 , for then only will t=\r\nhe truth be realized that the so called =E2=80=98lost=E2=80=99 tenth man is=\r\n only oneself, who has in fact never been lost. Similarly, so long as the e=\r\nxperience of non-duality appears to be lost, it is necessary for us to enqu=\r\nire and find out =E2=80=98Who am I, who have lost the experience of non-dua=\r\nlity?=E2=80=99, for then only will the truth be realized that the seeming i=\r\nndividual =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 who does not experience non-duality is merely=\r\n an unreal appearance, and that the real =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 has in fact ne=\r\nver lost the experience of non-duality.\n\nSource: Sri Ramanopadesa Noonmalai=\r\n Meaning By Sri Sadhu Om Translation By Michael James\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavat=\r\ne Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-215229807-1255621399=:45514\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thi=\r\ns is my email to the group to reply a queries as i beg to differ on technic=\r\nalities or rather present counter view (not necessarily argument) perspecti=\r\nve.

Similarly, when we attain Self-knowled=\r\nge we will realize that non-duality (advaita) is always the sole truth,both=\r\n during the time of our seeming ignorance (when nonduality appears to be lo=\r\nst and duality appears to prevail) and after our =E2=80=98attaining=E2=80=\r\n=99 Self,\n the non-dual reality.&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: =\r\nbold&quot;&gt;It is to be noted here that, though non-duality is the truth even dur=\r\ning the time of seeming ignorance, this does not mean that no spiritual pra=\r\nctice (sadhana) is necessary,as some theoreticians/ theorists have wrongly =\r\nconcluded.So long as the tenth man appears to be lost, it is necessary for =\r\neach one of the ten to enquire and find out =E2=80=98Who is lost?=E2=80=99 =\r\n, for then only will the truth be realized that the so called =E2=80=98lost=\r\n=E2=80=99 tenth man is only oneself, who has in fact never been lost. Simil=\r\narly, so long as the experience of non-duality appears to be lost, it is ne=\r\ncessary for us to enquire and find out =E2=80=98Who am I, who have lost the=\r\n experience of non-duality?=E2=80=99&lt;/SPAN&gt;, for then only will the truth b=\r\ne realized that the seeming individual =E2=80=98I=E2=80=99 who does not exp=\r\nerience non-duality is merely an unreal appearance, and that the real =E2=\r\n=80=98I=E2=80=99 has in fact never lost the experience of\n non-duality.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT: bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/SPAN&gt;: Sri Ramanopadesa Noonm=\r\nalai Meaning By Sri Sadhu Om Translation By Michael James\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV style=3D&quot;COLOR: rgb(51,51,51); FONT-SIZE: 87%&quot;&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;-- =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Om Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya&lt;BR&gt;Prasanth Jalasutram&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Love And L=\r\nove Alone&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-215229807-1255621399=:45514--\r\n\n"}}
