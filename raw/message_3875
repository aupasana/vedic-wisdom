In spite of having won some rec=\r\nognition in my small community as a musician/vidwan, releasing a CD playing=\r\n my chosen instrument Veena, I cannot even sing some compositons some times=\r\n because of the overwhelming emotion. And those are some songs on Shiva, Pa=\r\nrvati, Rama and\n Krishna. \n=C2=A0\nBut if I have to narrow down to one name,=\r\n I don&#39;t know how and how to leave any one form!

If priest was aware=\r\n and still did that, then I can\n&gt; understand the consequence.\n\nIf one goes =\r\nin the path of a tornado, aware or unaware that a tornado is coming, one wi=\r\nll still be consumed by it.\n\nIf the question is of fairness, well, is it fa=\r\nir that tornadoes, earthquakes, hurricanes etc should kill thousands of peo=\r\nple every year? Well, Natural order of the universe is neither fair nor unf=\r\nair. It is just an &quot;order&quot;. Your actions gets opposite reactions. You exper=\r\nience the fruits of your actions, as determined by the order of nature. A p=\r\nerson may happen to be doing what he sees as his dharma and earthquake may =\r\nstrike there and kill him. If so, there must be a previous karma as a resul=\r\nt of which he is placed there at that time.\n\nIn the case of the priest in t=\r\nhe story, his mistake is that he slapped a person worshipping god. If he ha=\r\nd no way of assessing the bhava (feeling) in the mind of the person doing t=\r\nhe worship, he should&#39;ve given the benefit of doubt and assumed it was a si=\r\nncere devotee, rather than assuming it was a fool.\n\nSee, when Ramakrishna w=\r\nent there and saw Trilinga Swami, he immediately knew the stature and remar=\r\nked that this is Viswanatha himself. However, others may not be so fortunat=\r\ne. You only saw a body with some body parts and some clothes and nothing be=\r\nyond it. If so, give the benefit of doubt and treat kindly and respectfully=\r\n. Just because of external parameters, do not judge a person and act harsh.=\r\n\n\nHitting a person who still has a limited self-identification is one thing=\r\n and hitting a person who has no limited self-identification and identifies=\r\n with the entire universe or with a deity is different.\n\n* * *\n\nIn any case=\r\n, do not worry about that priest that much. For all you know, he may be an =\r\nassociate of Shiva who came along with Trilinga Swami to enact a story and =\r\nteach a moral and he may have gone back to Shiva. Even if not, he was lucky=\r\n to enact an important role in an interesting divine drama.\n\n* * *\n\nJeevanm=\r\nuktas may engage in actions that are difficult to comprehend. They have no =\r\npersonal ego, will and agenda. They become instruments for Nature to fulfil=\r\n the Natural order. The action of Trilinga Swami may help several people qu=\r\nestion, challenge and overcome their biases and learn some important lesson=\r\ns, centuries after he left earth.\n\n* * *\n\nRegarding many gods: As I keep em=\r\nphasizing, yogis and saints sometimes give advices based on desa-kaala-paat=\r\nra or advices geared at a specific set of people.\n\nThere is nothing wrong i=\r\nn having many deities in pooja room and worshipping all. Such people may le=\r\nad fruitful dharmik lives. However, Vimalananda may not be concerned about =\r\nsuch people. His teachings may be addressed at some other people to come in=\r\n the coming years who he has rina with and who are meant to achieve saayujy=\r\na of some deities and do some work. There is an intended audience for every=\r\n work and no work can be perfect for all audience.\n\nIf the goal is either l=\r\niberation or a deity&#39;s darshan (vision) or saayujya (company), one has to a=\r\ngree that focusing on one deity is the best thing to do, rather than trying=\r\n to focus mind on ten deities and keep switching. A deity comes when mind a=\r\nnd its thoughts are filled with that deity&#39;s name and mantra and other thou=\r\nghts are driven away from the mind. Vimalananda perhaps wanted to motivate =\r\nseveral people to strive for vision/company of deities. He probably thought=\r\n some people he has a rina with would come to earth with such a potential.\n=\r\n\n* * *\n\nThyagaraja did compose songs on many deities. But, he first had a d=\r\narshan of Rama. He spent several years chanting Rama&#39;s name and had a darsh=\r\nan. Then he composed songs on many deities. However, he saw all of them as =\r\ndifferent emanations from Rama. He saw Rama in all.\n\nSame with Aadi Shankar=\r\na, Muththuswamy Deekshitar, Bammera Pothana and others.\n\nWhen one achieves =\r\nperfection in surrender to one deity, one&#39;s life is made. After that, one w=\r\nill see the same deity in all deities even if he worships 100 deities. If o=\r\nne is switching between ten deities before that, it may not be helpful in f=\r\nilling the mind with thoughts of any of those deities. Mind sees those deit=\r\nies as different objects and may not fully surrender to any of them. Still,=\r\n as I said, one may lead a fruitful dhaarmik life. That&#39;s fine.\n\nBut, if yo=\r\nu really want to taste the nectar of complete surrender, it is better to pi=\r\nck one deity and fill the mind with his/her thoughts.\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; Excellent a=\r\nnswers on each thread and mother showed her divine\n&gt; grace through you that=\r\n I am able to find answers to many\n&gt; questions that my immature mind keeps =\r\non asking! \n\nThough I had some spiritual experiences fortunately, I am not =\r\na realized person.

But contrar=\r\ny to that we find great saints / composers / poets from India have indeed w=\r\norshipped many forms of the God and were successful in that approach as wel=\r\nl. For instance, there is not a single deity form that was not worshipped b=\r\ny Adi Sankara and/or Muththuswamy Dikshitar. It was famous that Muththuswam=\r\ny Dikshitar was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka and he left his mortal coil=\r\n by singing to Madurai MeenakshiDevi in the presence of many of his discipl=\r\nes. But he composed songs of deep devotion that have immense power and dept=\r\nh on Lord Shiva, Ganesha, Subramanya, Rama and so on. So was Thyagaraja. So=\r\n were many great composers of Carnatic Music in that path. In fact they wer=\r\ne all great advaitis and never saw any difference between any form of the G=\r\nod, what soever. Bammera Pothana, a great poet of Andhra who\n&gt; translated B=\r\nhagavatam, in his opening invocatory poems, pays homage to Lord Vishnu, Shi=\r\nva, Brahma, Ganesha, Saraswati, Brahmi, Durga, Lakshmi in that order before=\r\n declaring that he got the divine inspiration from Lord Rama to write the S=\r\ntories of Krishna! Where is the difference between any form of God here! I =\r\nwonder. So, I was not able to comprehend why Vimalananda accuses many Hindu=\r\ns of having a chaotic mind just because their puja mandirams are filled wit=\r\nh many photographs/ idols of different murthis of Almighty.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj \n\n\n=\r\n&gt; Dear Narasimhagaru, \n&gt; \n&gt; Excellent answers on each thread and mother sho=\r\nwed her divine grace through you that I am able to find answers to many que=\r\nstions that my immature mind keeps on asking! \n&gt; \n&gt; Anyway, coming back to =\r\nthe topic, some of the topics I found disturbing in the first book of Aghor=\r\na are as follows: \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. On the page 45 it says that Telang swami perform=\r\ned the ritual bath of Kashi Vishveshwara with his own urine and feces. What=\r\n could be the compelling reason for this bizarre behavior and why should th=\r\ne priest who slapped him die, because in my opinion, anyone else would have=\r\n done the same in the least! Since you have an excellent way to explain man=\r\ny seemingly disturbing things, I hope to find and answer here. \n&gt; \n&gt; 2. In =\r\nquite a few places, Vimalananda equates changing the loyalty from diety to =\r\ndiety as akin to prostitution, which I find as an extreme view! If that wer=\r\ne true, why would Adi Sankara compose so many hymns in praise of so many di=\r\neties, Thyagaraja composed in the praise of Sri Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganes=\r\nha and Jaganmata as well. So are so many great composers / poets. The examp=\r\nles of Tulasidas and Leelashuka where they wanted to see their favorite dei=\r\nty form only (rama in the case of former and krishna in the case of latter)=\r\n despite knowing that the other form is the same supreme being, are only a =\r\nvery minority in the list of Bhaktas that we have? Why this kind of a view.=\r\n I see myself being equally in the love and awe of every form of god, namel=\r\ny Shiva, rama, krishna, ganesha, amba, subramanya, anjaneya and so on! \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Nagraj \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 3/2/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; wro=\r\nte:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Surrender (Re: Aghora books..)\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt;=\r\n Date: Tuesday, March 2, 2010, 6:31 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHow to achieve it effectivey?\n&gt; \n&gt; If it can be achieved easily, we will no=\r\nt have so many spiritual paths and so many sadhanas.

Otherwise, Arjuna=\r\n could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have written off the wrongs of the Kauravas as a massive rnu=\r\n, but of course,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna urged him to take up the dharma of kshatri=\r\nyahood and slay without\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mercy. The webs of karma are too intricate =\r\nand complex and delicate to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comprehended unless one has reached =\r\ncertain very very high levels of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual attainment, and even the=\r\nn, it will only be a partial vision. Only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; S/He who is unlimited (Is=\r\nwara/i) knows and sees the entire web of karma and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knows best how t=\r\no dispatch rnus as necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Aditiji and ot=\r\nhers,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun could do what he did for a reason.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arj=\r\nun was a great sadhaka himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What he did was sort of simple. He =\r\ndid so much sadhana of a deity that this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deity began to occupy him =\r\nday and night. This deity was a form of Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That in turn gave hi=\r\nm the rarest of rare opportunity to be with Krishna at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the time of =\r\nthe battle, because Shiva is the greatest Vaishnava, the only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one w=\r\nho knows how to worship Krishna properly. Only by becoming Shiva\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yo=\r\nurself can you worship Krishna perfectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, at the time=\r\n of the battle, Arjun was beset with doubt, but when he saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Vis=\r\nwharoopa something crazy happened as if Krishna was within him. Of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncourse Krishna was present even before, but Arjun could not perceive Him\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; properly. this was Krishna&#39;s lila or play of course, because otherwis=\r\ne would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun have treated him as a friend ever??!!(slapping Him on=\r\n the back,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; playing tricks on Him, but the Lord loves to play with H=\r\nis genuine devotees)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok, now once Arjun&#39;s remnant personal=\r\nity was further effaced and replaced by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna in his form as Kaal=\r\na Viswharoopa, then it was effectively Krishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who destroyed the Ka=\r\nuravas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why at the end of the battle when all the Pandavas =\r\nwent to ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person who had been decapitated by Krishna&#39;s Sudars=\r\nhana but who was still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kept alive at the top of the tree,..... abou=\r\nt who was responsible for the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pandava&#39;s victory..... ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A=\r\nll that man said was that at the beginning of the day he could see the\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Sudarshana start out from one end of the battlefield, then having done =\r\nall\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that destruction, it would return to krishna&#39;s hand at the end =\r\nof the day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And the blood which was being spilt was drunk by Krishn=\r\na Shakti or Kali.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was lucky, He had God incarnate at=\r\n His side, others may not be quite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so fortunate. For example, Ramak=\r\nrishna used to say that a doctor&#39;s money was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blood and pus (I left =\r\nmy thriving surgical career when I read this a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years ago).\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; He said something similar about the money earned by a lawyer.(I think h=\r\ne was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; referring to criminal law in that time).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Eas=\r\niest thing to do is Ishwar(Ishwari) pranidhana. Surrender to God. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n freely admitted to the Lord when I had His darshana that I was a complete\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fool and knew nothing at all. She taught me all I know because of t=\r\nhis.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whatever you ever do in life, just try and be straight in ever=\r\ny dealing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that you have with anybody, give whatever you can, turn a=\r\nway nobody from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your door, who knows when God will come to test you=\r\n?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This does not mean that one is fatalistic and does nothi=\r\nng, but it means\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that terrific sadhana is useful, nay even necessar=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadhana and a real Guru (Gu kara&#39;s cha andhakas cha-rem=\r\noves darkness Ru kas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cha Teja Uchayte- brings light into the being)=\r\n, are essential. Before I met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my real Guru, I saw plenty of guys wh=\r\no were basically sadhakas themselves, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; used to ask and swear at th=\r\nem, &quot;You are blind yourself, how will you lead\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the blind me to God,=\r\n when you have not seen God yourself face to face?!!! &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On=\r\nce you take Time out of the equation (because a deity has a different time\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; space frame which runs in thousands of years which pass by in a bli=\r\nnk of an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eye) by waiting with patience, then where will God go? God=\r\n has to come, He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can&#39;t escape.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Love\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Sat, Feb 27, 2010 at 9:05 PM, Narasi=\r\nmha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; If you see the old mail quoted by Hemanth below, it will answer your\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Just because a group of people think so=\r\nmething is their dharma and do it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; does not free them from karma. =\r\nThat may not even really be their dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing one&#39;s dharma, a=\r\ns explained below, is very difficult. As one becomes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; purer, one&#39;s=\r\n dharma becomes clearer to one. The sense of dharma of a densely\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nconditioned mind is corrupted by that conditioning.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sec=\r\nondly, even doing one&#39;s true dharma does not mean one does not incur\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; karma. If Nature selects someone, because of one&#39;s prior conditioning a=\r\nnd\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debts, to kill thousand bad people, and one fulfils dharma by =\r\nkilling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thousand bad people, that person WILL incur new karma for=\r\n it. Dharma (duty)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and moksha (liberation) are two different puru=\r\nsharthas and not one.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Fulfilling dharma is helpful for liberation=\r\n, but not sufficient.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In addition to doing dharma, one =\r\nneeds to overcome ego (I-ness) and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doership. As ego and the sense=\r\n of doership goes down, the speed at which new\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; karmas are incurre=\r\nd goes down. Dharma becomes clearer. For liberation, one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; needs to=\r\n lower ego and the sense of doership and do one&#39;s dharma (i.e. pay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; back debts) without attachment and doership.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The mail=\r\n quoted by Hemanth clarifies some key concepts and worth reading\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nand understanding carefully.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Na=\r\nrasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writ=\r\nings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri T=\r\narpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;http://www.vedicast rolog=\r\ner.org/ &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.or=\r\ng\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Se Am &lt;mahalaxmyey@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i heard=\r\n that Muslims used to behead meditating sages head when they were\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n meditating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so Muslims dharma is to kill other religious people=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so will Muslims attact bad karma or sin?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; From: Hemanth Srinivas &lt;hemanthks@. ..&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ ya=\r\nhoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, even I think one has to follow =\r\nDharma.

Right action varies from person to person, from time to time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; and from place to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from yo=\r\nu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which in turn is based on who you have been in the past, wha=\r\nt actions you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did in the past while identifying with the action=\r\n, who you affected in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; past (and how) with the act=\r\nions that you identified with, what debts you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created in the pr=\r\nocess, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts=\r\n, nature wants a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to kill evil persons, that be=\r\ncomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mental\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendenc=\r\nies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the message\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.

If, based on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; menta=\r\nl tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to make a lot\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; money and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The dharma of a being =\r\nmay change from one life to another.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the time of=\r\n Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gurus,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eld=\r\ners and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some=\r\n weight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tremendous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and=\r\n civilization destroyed to a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extent,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome=\r\n Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; warrior,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deeply lo=\r\nved and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dharma =\r\nto kill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna was born again i=\r\nn the 19th century as one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas=\r\n (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous life, according=\r\n to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; n=\r\new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspir=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and=\r\n service to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others. When he is born again (which he has to, as =\r\nper what Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said), his dharma based on the time and pl=\r\nace may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;f=\r\nollow your own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; =\r\nin the light of castism. Though the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of caste =\r\n(varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, the concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; o=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who =\r\nlived by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi lat=\r\ner. Vishwamitra was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. =\r\nHe became a brahmana and and a maharshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later. Basically varna =\r\nshows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; varna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; o=\r\nf father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which=\r\n tells you to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wro=\r\nng. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the wor=\r\nld. Each person has individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what=\r\n one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; en=\r\nough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind that tells us what our dharma is, but it is surro=\r\nunded by a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noise from other parts of our minds which tel=\r\nl other things. Thus, we get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nWe should make the best judgment combining discrimination and intuition\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. W=\r\ne may be err, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the best we can is all that w=\r\ne can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More than following dharma, what is of ut=\r\nmost importance is to engage in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions without identification.=\r\n *That* alone ensures that we are not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, =\r\ni.e. not increasing the load. We should not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too=\r\n much attachment to what we are doing. We should engage in the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; possible actions (based on our best judgment on what our dharma in the=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with as little attachment and s=\r\nelf-identification with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. When the action=\r\n is finished, we should leave the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We s=\r\nhould not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wo=\r\nrk&quot; etc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; untached action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; slowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper a=\r\nnd tell our dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clearer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a positive feedb=\r\nack here. This will slowly enable us to see our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly =\r\nand follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nbottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if one engag=\r\nes in action with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * =\r\n* *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and i=\r\nntuition are the inputs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another external input is the words of=\r\n scriptures and learned men. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dha=\r\nrma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the wor=\r\nds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow=\r\n it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what =\r\nhis dharma was and thought killing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gurus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and relative=\r\ns was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dh=\r\narma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded =\r\nplace to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried an=\r\nd prevailed upon him to stay in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world an=\r\nd do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who is not in =\r\ntune with nature and does not know who one is, what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; debts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated so=\r\nul with a clear insight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a=\r\n guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of princ=\r\niples and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from p=\r\nerson to person,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to time and from place to =\r\nplace. Also, there are no thumbrules to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out what=\r\n one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;=\r\ns\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma by increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds =\r\nof spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in ac=\r\ntions without much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attachment, one can slowly purify oneself an=\r\nd refine one&#39;s understanding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s individual dhar=\r\nma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sense of Disti=\r\nnction and of good and evil is bound to persist so long as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one do=\r\nes not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Fr=\r\ni, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@gmail. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree with Dinesh.

Mr. VS\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give=\r\ns many excuses and many dates but fails and ultimately does not pay\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; back.

He follows up for the money but with the attitude\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; of detachment. Although he shows to his family and friends that he is\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extremely concerned and it was foolish act etc... But in his mind=\r\n he thinks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that it was a rina from some past life which was fulfi=\r\nlled. He thinks that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they were Money of Mother and she will take =\r\ncare. If they needed to come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; back, she will do it or if they were=\r\n to be paid to nullify some past rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then they will not come ba=\r\nck.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; With th=\r\ne Second Approach, I think, Mr. FL will not Create New Rinas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and =\r\nwill be able to break free from this particular chain. He may have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; successfully PAID BACK his debt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; With the=\r\n first Approach, Mr. FL has identified himself very strongly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with=\r\n Money and its ownership and hence all the actions done due to that, so\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; He may have created NEW RINAS which will be needed to settled on a l=\r\nater\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; date.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; However I am not sure for what I have written.

As time goes on, the=C3=83? thing in your mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nhich thinks of sex is incinerated and slowly you find that a naked\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; female(or male as=C3=83? may be the case)=C3=83? body is like a landscape=\r\n picture just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; like any other picture made by Her of nature(like N=\r\niagara falls, or Angkor\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Wat, you need not be disturbed by it, you=\r\n can certainly=C3=83? feel that the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; picture=C3=83? is very beauti=\r\nful=C3=83? but you need not be aroused by it).

When I as=\r\nked how much it will cost, he said &quot;I will arrange\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everything. Yo=\r\nu and Manish just come and sit for sankalpam&quot;.

Swami Sathasivom had several books on homam gifte=\r\nd to us by a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friend=C3=83? of his on the next day, without Manish=\r\n telling anything about the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mother&#39;s command to anyone.

Swami Sathasivom is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one of th=\r\ne rare priests we find today, who is not only a priest but also a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n yogi and a sadhaka. He has childlike innocence, simplicty, rare humility=\r\n=C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and love for all. He conducts himself with detachment by =\r\nseeking nothing and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; avoiding nothing. He conducted some of the be=\r\nst homams and poojas I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; witnessed. He has been on mouna vrata=\r\nm (vow of silence) for more than a year\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and communicates by writi=\r\nng (saying mantras in pooja/homam is an exception).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I can gi=\r\nve an analogy for the last point regarding an aghora&#39;s way\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to ove=\r\nrcome any=C3=83? weakness for sex that may be left in the mind (which may\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; make sexual=C3=83? thoughts arise in the mind now and then).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Supp=\r\nose you are trying to read a book and a friend is distracting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you=\r\n and irritating you by talking about something else. You can try to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; ignore him and focus on the book. Alternatively, you can also try to get=\r\n him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; interested in the book and call him to read the book along w=\r\nith you. In the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beginning, he may still distract you and make it =\r\nmore difficult to read.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, it is possible that he also likes th=\r\ne book and starts enjoying the book\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; along with you and stops dist=\r\nracting you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; If meditation is like reading a book, weakness for sex is lik=\r\ne the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friend and sexual thoughts that arise in the mind are like =\r\nthe distractions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; caused by the friend, then aghora&#39;s sadhana I me=\r\nntioned is like getting the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; friend to read the book along with yo=\r\nu.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; However, as I said, there are no guarantees. This friend may get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; interested in the book and stop distracting you, or he may continue to\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; distract you and make it worse by being right next to you through=\r\n the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reading. It is tricky to know how long one should try before=\r\n deciding that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it is not working.

The idea is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that one is =\r\nnot bound by Maayaa once one *fully* understands and appreciates\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nit.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Chandipath consists of symbolic stories of wars that the divine\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Mother fought, which explain how one can fight and overcome various\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses that typically bind one in Maayaa. Reciting these stories=\r\n on a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regular basis will promote the fighting spirit within one t=\r\nhat fights these\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; weaknesses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; There is nothing wrong in understan=\r\nding Maayaa and trying to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fight/overcome it at the same time. One=\r\n aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One aspect of the Mother ma=\r\nkes you experience good and bad in that Maayaa.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One aspect of the=\r\n Mother makes you understand Maayaa to overcome it. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aspect of=\r\n the Mother makes you fight and overcome it. When one realizes Self\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; at the end, irrespective of the path taken, one finally sees that all th=\r\nese\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; are aspects of a Single Mother who is also essentially true S=\r\nelf.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Also, I have started to read the Aghora series books by D=\r\nr.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Robert\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Svobodha. For now I have very mixed=\r\n feelings on the subject.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Perhaps I need to read more!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n Aghora series books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; every=\r\none&#39;s cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Ghora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;=\r\n. One of the names\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C3=83? Aghora =\r\n(aghori) does not see anything as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terrible or bad or impure and s=\r\nees all as impermanent manifestations of god\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and tries to focus t=\r\nhe thinking of the mind on what is permanent (god)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always, instea=\r\nd of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone dies, north Indians c=\r\nhant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carrying the dead body to the f=\r\nuneral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is true and everythi=\r\nng else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that life =\r\nand death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate trut=\r\nh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedl=\r\ny great thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we have done and we are about to feel proud and hap=\r\npy, can&#39;t we tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we =\r\ndid and the praises are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is rea=\r\nl. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;? When we feel a=\r\nttracted to something beautiful and want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get it, can&#39;t we tell=\r\n ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems beautiful=\r\n and other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusi=\r\nons. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone=\r\n attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; angry, can=\r\n&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temp=\r\norary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai=\r\n&quot; always. His mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lo=\r\nrd (instead of *dwelling* on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them by classifying them as pure and=\r\n impure, good and bad etc and thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about them with attraction=\r\n/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent. But=\r\n he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83?=\r\n =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety=\r\n we perceive is an illusion&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora pursues it practically. I=\r\nf feces and fruit are both impermenant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions and the only per=\r\nmanent reality within them is the Self, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions why he can e=\r\nat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feces is eat=\r\nen.=C3=83? But, please remember that eating feces is not the main\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main p=\r\noint. For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, f=\r\nor such a person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestat=\r\nion of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating it. A successful Aghora may be=\r\n eating feces, but the mind will not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dwelling on the fact that=\r\n he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will not feel a=\r\nny kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he is=\r\n eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions really. He c=\r\nhants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am=\r\n Self and I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may m=\r\nerely be a ritual and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As=\r\n he eats, his mind may dwell on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermanant manifestations of=\r\n Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; curry&quot;, &quot;a overly=\r\n salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent (S=\r\nelf).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; truth and trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. =\r\nBut\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation where failu=\r\nre results in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; very bad dual experience. That can in fact work a=\r\ns an incentive in forcing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one to transcend duality! In the case o=\r\nf a person who chants a Vedic verse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that says &quot;I am Self and I am=\r\n consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nicely made food, the =\r\nfallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating is n=\r\not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ntaste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of fece=\r\ns, it will\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results =\r\nin a very bad dual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience may act as an incentive in succeedi=\r\nng quickly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Agh=\r\nora sadhanas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83=\r\n? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Take another =\r\nsimple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, like j=\r\napam and homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s =\r\nmind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A regular=\r\n person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; away from =\r\nsexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\noughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fa=\r\nscination\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in the mind does not return to bite one after that. But=\r\n, how to overcome the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fascination some minds may have for sex?\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A=\r\nn aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sex as two different activities (one pure and the other impure), =\r\nhe may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; combine them into one without such distinctions of pure vs=\r\n impure. Suppose\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting na=\r\nked on his lap and then does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his japam. In the beginning, this ma=\r\ny titillate and result in sex. He may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think that his sadhana is b=\r\neing made impure. But, suppose he persists to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; japam like that =\r\nfor several months/years. Eventually, mind may be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reprogrammed. H=\r\ne may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may no=\r\n longer feel titillation.
