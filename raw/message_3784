It is also beyond\nPrakriti or nature. Where there is absolute Reality, no quality of nature\ncan reach. As a thief cannot go to the exact spot where the treasure is,\nbecause he is afraid of being caught, so Sattwa, Rajas, and Tamas, like\nthieves, cannot go to the realm where, is the treasure of the Absolute.
