Misuse of our sense organ=\r\ns leads to diseases and\nmental stress. If we refuse to observe the rules of=\r\n healthy eating and\nresting our life force gets depleted quickly. To protec=\r\nt our health it is\nimportant to observe Brahmacharya (sexual continence). T=\r\nhe body becomes ill\nbecause of misuse of the 5 senses and mind becomes dise=\r\nases because of\nunwholesome thinking. Mental promiscuousness is even more d=\r\neadly than bodily\nillnesses. Hence always urge your psyche to think positiv=\r\nely and in a sacred\nmanner. Along with the body and mind one should have im=\r\nmense self control\nregarding ones wealth too. If we succeed in desirably co=\r\nntrolling our body,\nmind and wealth we will become strong, great thinkers a=\r\nnd prosperous both\nmaterially and spiritually.\n6) UNITY: Success in any for=\r\nm is totally dependent on our mental equipoise\nand balance. A mental state =\r\nwherein man remains calm and serene under all\ncircumstances is most require=\r\nd today. Never despair when dire situations\nglare at us and instead always =\r\nthink positively. Such a mind is extremely\nwell balanced and healthy. With =\r\ndue diligence and practice anyone can\ndevelop this inner state of serenity.=\r\n All the great tasks executed in world\nhistory and all great leaders and th=\r\ninkers of the world definitely possessed\nsuch a focused and sacred psyche. =\r\nBy taking recourse to it one can march\nahead in any chosen field of life wi=\r\nth honor.\n7) WORLD AS ONE FAMILY: The chain that binds an individual to soc=\r\niety is the\ninstitution called a family. Society is nothing but a congregat=\r\nion of many\nsmall units called families. No doubt efforts are required to i=\r\nnduce\nprogress in every family and make every member cultured and great in\n=\r\ncharacter. despite this one should not limit progress to this tiny unit and=\r\n\ninstead we must widen our mental horizon so as to encompass the entire wor=\r\nld\nas our family. The Vedas say =91UDAAR CHARITAANAAM TU VASUDHAIVA KUTUMBA=\r\nKAM=92\nmeaning one imbued with great character looks upon the entire world =\r\nas\nhis/her family. Thus our sentiments towards our family should wax like t=\r\nhe\nmoon in such a way that the entire world becomes our beloved family. We =\r\nmust\nuse our bodily and mental potential for the advancement of the entire =\r\nworld.\nSuch cog in the wheel like contributions to the world will definitel=\r\ny herald\na heavenly atmosphere on earth on an eternal basis.\n8) SOCIALISM: =\r\nMan obtains wealth and comforts from society so as to lead a\nprosperous lif=\r\ne. Hence it now becomes his duty to contribute humbly to\nsociety=92s progre=\r\nss and peace. It is ethical duty to look after society=92s\nwell being and i=\r\ns as important as his duty towards his family and relatives.\nSociety can be=\r\n well managed and made prosperous only if every world denizen\nobserves his =\r\nduty towards his family and the entire society in an ethical\nand honest man=\r\nner. We must behave with others exactly in the way we desire\nother to behav=\r\ne with us (if we do not like abuses from others stop abusing\nothers your se=\r\nlf). Only on the basis of this test that principles of ethics\nand social du=\r\nties will proliferate infinitely. Further it is as important to\nweed out ta=\r\ninted traditions, criminal leanings and blind beliefs from their\nroots when=\r\n compared to imbibing ethical living. World society will attain\nglory and g=\r\nrandeur only when every individual imbibes discipline, wholesome\nbehavior, =\r\nsense of world brotherhood and sacred duty to society on a day to\nday basis=\r\n.\n9) SACREDNESS AND PURITY: Sacredness is a shining ornament of man=92s\ncha=\r\nracter. Brilliance in various fields (art, music, industry, media etc)\ncan =\r\nbe given due respect only when it encompasses humility gentlemanliness\nwhil=\r\ne dealing with others. It also means giving due respect to those who\ndeserv=\r\ne it and never falling into the trap of vanity and arrogance.\nMaintaining d=\r\necorum as far as ones mode of dressing, body and other\naccessories used to =\r\nfalls under its jurisdiction. Shabby or very gaudy\nclothes and ill kept obj=\r\nects give a very bad impression to others. Hence opt\nfor a simple dressing =\r\nstyle which adds to your inner aura. Our first\nimpressions of other people =\r\ncommence with their general appearance and their\nway of dressing. Moreover =\r\nif the objects used by us are well maintained\n(watch, cell phone, car etc) =\r\nit shows that our minds too are focused and\ndisciplined. Our external life =\r\nshould be well managed and inner life full of\ngentlemanliness. This is the =\r\ngoal of good behavior.\n10) PUNCTUALITY: The substratum of all types of whol=\r\nesome success in life is\nproper time management and balanced hard work. The=\r\n path of progress is laid\ndown when we regularly execute our daily routine =\r\nand work hard optimally.\nEvery action, be it minute or great in importance =\r\nshould be dealt with in an\nequally focused manner and thus success will kno=\r\nck on your door without\nfail. Every action done with due concentration show=\r\ns the diligence of its\ndoer. Wasting precious time is equivalent to wasting=\r\n our precious human\nlife. Those who truly understand the true importance of=\r\n a human life make\noptimum use of time in their hands. Apart from family re=\r\nsponsibilities time\nand ones efforts should definitely be utilized for cont=\r\nributing to social\nwelfare.\n11) INTEGRITY: Man is said to be ethical when h=\r\ne is transparent and honest\nas far as wealth generation and its expenditure=\r\n is concerned and that he\nresponsibly enacts all his duties. In material li=\r\nfe only those prosper who\nare full of integrity and responsibility. Profess=\r\nionally too only they\nsucceed who are ethical and full of transparency in a=\r\nll their transactions.\nThey respect accountability and commitment in their =\r\nvarious professions.\nThere is a demand for candidates who responsibly and w=\r\nith commitment execute\njobs assigned to them. Even society honors and rever=\r\nes them. In turn society\nalways stands by their side in a cooperative manne=\r\nr. Not only should our\nwealth creation be ethical but that a part of it mus=\r\nt be used for social\nwelfare. One must keep ones expenses minimum and whate=\r\nver remains must be\nused for world well being. Such pious sentiments of wor=\r\nld welfare zooms\nmankind to the peaks of human glory.\n12) SENSE OF RIGHT AN=\r\nD WRONG: It is an enlightened discriminative intellect\nthat can tell us wha=\r\nt is right and what is not. There prevail today\ninnumerable blind beliefs, =\r\nlack luster traditions and blind practices which\nwhen tested prove to be to=\r\ntally useless. And yet because they have prevailed\nover a very long time sp=\r\nan it is difficult for people to give them up. Hence\nit is only the light o=\r\nf discrimination that can give man the necessary\nstrength to renounce them =\r\nin totality. It helps man overcome narrow minded\nthinking and instead works=\r\n selflessly for world peace and prosperity. Many\nblind beliefs like death f=\r\neasts, animal sacrifice, dowry system, ghost\nmediums, sorcery, astrology fo=\r\nr material pursuits, leaving everything to\nfate etc have made our society w=\r\neak and demeaned. And yet because vested\ninterests label them as =91ancient=\r\n traditions=92 no one has the valor to give\nthem up. Thus the only way to u=\r\nproot them is generating necessary daring for\nthis via an enlightened discr=\r\nimination.\n13) ATTAINING THE SPIRITUAL GOAL: Spiritual goals are attained w=\r\nhen we use\nour time, effort, wealth, skills and capabilities for rooting ou=\r\nt sorrow and\ndownfall of society. The more one contributes their potential =\r\nfor this cause\nthe more one will progress on the path of spirituality. The =\r\ngoal of\ndevotion, meditation and penance is to manifest this spiritual view=\r\npoint in\nour psyche/soul. When a compassionate heart helps those in need it=\r\n\nexperiences untold divine bliss which is not equivalent to even all materi=\r\nal\njoy of the world put together.\n14) RADIANT SKILLS: When there is a lack =\r\nof radiant skills other qualities\nof ones psyche lose their utility sheen a=\r\nnd importance too. Man can swim in\nthe infinite ocean of glory only if he d=\r\neeply imbibes gentlemanliness,\nhumility, generosity, sense of service (Seva=\r\n Bhava) and fearlessness. A weak\nminded individual may be a gentleman and y=\r\net he never has the daring to\noppose undesirable trends in society. It is b=\r\necause of this that he fails to\nhelp benefit the world at large with his ge=\r\nnerous and wholesome character.\nEven minor hiccups in life make him tensed =\r\nand thus out of fear bows down to\nunruly and illegal elements. Thus simply =\r\nbecause he lacks daring all his\nother wholesome qualities become pale and u=\r\nseless. A point to note is that\nat any given point in time the number of di=\r\nctators, autocrats and criminals\nhas been in the minority and yet because t=\r\nhey are fearless (in a demonic\nway) they achieve their unethical goals. Hen=\r\nce it is most required that\nalong with other sacred qualities a spiritual s=\r\neeker must develop wholesome\nenterprise, daring and valor.\n\nThe above 14 pr=\r\necepts if imbibed by every layman will definitely reap\ndividends of greatne=\r\nss of character and they are accepted by all religions\nthe world over. We c=\r\nan say that they are universal, meant for every world\nindividual and is sui=\r\ntable for all times. Despite the disparity of time,\nplace and individual pe=\r\nrsonalities everyone can follow the above 14 precepts\nfor material and spir=\r\nitual prosperity (barring those very few exceptions of\na rare kind).\n=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D end =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D end\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=\r\n=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D\n Author : Pt shriram Sharma Acharyaji\n\n-- \nT=\r\nhank you and Have a Fulfilling Day\n\nVenkat Koppaka\n\r\n--0015175cb832c2bc5d046ffd8108\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Dear ALL&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Namaste.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=\r\n=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;5) SELF CONTROL: It is only via self control that we can ren=\r\nder our body and mind healthy and balanced. Misuse of our sense organs lead=\r\ns to diseases and mental stress. If we refuse to observe the rules of healt=\r\nhy eating and resting our life force gets depleted quickly. To protect our =\r\nhealth it is important to observe Brahmacharya (sexual continence). The bod=\r\ny becomes ill because of misuse of the 5 senses and mind becomes diseases b=\r\necause of unwholesome thinking. Mental promiscuousness is even more deadly =\r\nthan bodily illnesses. Hence always urge your psyche to think positively an=\r\nd in a sacred manner. Along with the body and mind one should have immense =\r\nself control regarding ones wealth too. If we succeed in desirably controll=\r\ning our body, mind and wealth we will become strong, great thinkers and pro=\r\nsperous both materially and spiritually.&lt;br&gt;\n6) UNITY: Success in any form =\r\nis totally dependent on our mental equipoise and balance. A mental state wh=\r\nerein man remains calm and serene under all circumstances is most required =\r\ntoday. Never despair when dire situations glare at us and instead always th=\r\nink positively. Such a mind is extremely well balanced and healthy. With du=\r\ne diligence and practice anyone can develop this inner state of serenity. A=\r\nll the great tasks executed in world history and all great leaders and thin=\r\nkers of the world definitely possessed such a focused and sacred psyche. By=\r\n taking recourse to it one can march ahead in any chosen field of life with=\r\n honor.&lt;br&gt;\n7) WORLD AS ONE FAMILY: The chain that binds an individual to s=\r\nociety is the institution called a family.

The Vedas say =91UDAAR CHARITAANAAM TU VASUDHAIVA KUTUM=\r\nBAKAM=92 meaning one imbued with great character looks upon the entire worl=\r\nd as his/her family. Thus our sentiments towards our family should wax like=\r\n the moon in such a way that the entire world becomes our beloved family. W=\r\ne must use our bodily and mental potential for the advancement of the entir=\r\ne world. Such cog in the wheel like contributions to the world will definit=\r\nely herald a heavenly atmosphere on earth on an eternal basis.&lt;br&gt;\n8) SOCIA=\r\nLISM: Man obtains wealth and comforts from society so as to lead a prospero=\r\nus life. Hence it now becomes his duty to contribute humbly to society=92s =\r\nprogress and peace. It is ethical duty to look after society=92s well being=\r\n and is as important as his duty towards his family and relatives. Society =\r\ncan be well managed and made prosperous only if every world denizen observe=\r\ns his duty towards his family and the entire society in an ethical and hone=\r\nst manner. We must behave with others exactly in the way we desire other to=\r\n behave with us (if we do not like abuses from others stop abusing others y=\r\nour self). Only on the basis of this test that principles of ethics and soc=\r\nial duties will proliferate infinitely. Further it is as important to weed =\r\nout tainted traditions, criminal leanings and blind beliefs from their root=\r\ns when compared to imbibing ethical living. World society will attain glory=\r\n and grandeur only when every individual imbibes discipline, wholesome beha=\r\nvior, sense of world brotherhood and sacred duty to society on a day to day=\r\n basis.&lt;br&gt;\n9) SACREDNESS AND PURITY: Sacredness is a shining ornament of m=\r\nan=92s character. Brilliance in various fields (art, music, industry, media=\r\n etc) can be given due respect only when it encompasses humility gentlemanl=\r\niness while dealing with others. It also means giving due respect to those =\r\nwho deserve it and never falling into the trap of vanity and arrogance. Mai=\r\nntaining decorum as far as ones mode of dressing, body and other accessorie=\r\ns used to falls under its jurisdiction. Shabby or very gaudy clothes and il=\r\nl kept objects give a very bad impression to others. Hence opt for a simple=\r\n dressing style which adds to your inner aura. Our first impressions of oth=\r\ner people commence with their general appearance and their way of dressing.=\r\n Moreover if the objects used by us are well maintained (watch, cell phone,=\r\n car etc) it shows that our minds too are focused and disciplined. Our exte=\r\nrnal life should be well managed and inner life full of gentlemanliness. Th=\r\nis is the goal of good behavior.&lt;br&gt;\n10) PUNCTUALITY: The substratum of all=\r\n types of wholesome success in life is proper time management and balanced =\r\nhard work. The path of progress is laid down when we regularly execute our =\r\ndaily routine and work hard optimally. Every action, be it minute or great =\r\nin importance should be dealt with in an equally focused manner and thus su=\r\nccess will knock on your door without fail. Every action done with due conc=\r\nentration shows the diligence of its doer. Wasting precious time is equival=\r\nent to wasting our precious human life. Those who truly understand the true=\r\n importance of a human life make optimum use of time in their hands. Apart =\r\nfrom family responsibilities time and ones efforts should definitely be uti=\r\nlized for contributing to social welfare.&lt;br&gt;\n11) INTEGRITY: Man is said to=\r\n be ethical when he is transparent and honest as far as wealth generation a=\r\nnd its expenditure is concerned and that he responsibly enacts all his duti=\r\nes. In material life only those prosper who are full of integrity and respo=\r\nnsibility. Professionally too only they succeed who are ethical and full of=\r\n transparency in all their transactions. They respect accountability and co=\r\nmmitment in their various professions. There is a demand for candidates who=\r\n responsibly and with commitment execute jobs assigned to them. Even societ=\r\ny honors and reveres them. In turn society always stands by their side in a=\r\n cooperative manner. Not only should our wealth creation be ethical but tha=\r\nt a part of it must be used for social welfare. One must keep ones expenses=\r\n minimum and whatever remains must be used for world well being. Such pious=\r\n sentiments of world welfare zooms mankind to the peaks of human glory.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n12) SENSE OF RIGHT AND WRONG: It is an enlightened discriminative intellec=\r\nt that can tell us what is right and what is not. There prevail today innum=\r\nerable blind beliefs, lack luster traditions and blind practices which when=\r\n tested prove to be totally useless. And yet because they have prevailed ov=\r\ner a very long time span it is difficult for people to give them up. Hence =\r\nit is only the light of discrimination that can give man the necessary stre=\r\nngth to renounce them in totality. It helps man overcome narrow minded thin=\r\nking and instead works selflessly for world peace and prosperity. Many blin=\r\nd beliefs like death feasts, animal sacrifice, dowry system, ghost mediums,=\r\n sorcery, astrology for material pursuits, leaving everything to fate etc h=\r\nave made our society weak and demeaned. And yet because vested interests la=\r\nbel them as =91ancient traditions=92 no one has the valor to give them up. =\r\nThus the only way to uproot them is generating necessary daring for this vi=\r\na an enlightened discrimination.&lt;br&gt;\n13) ATTAINING THE SPIRITUAL GOAL: Spir=\r\nitual goals are attained when we use our time, effort, wealth, skills and c=\r\napabilities for rooting out sorrow and downfall of society. The more one co=\r\nntributes their potential for this cause the more one will progress on the =\r\npath of spirituality. The goal of devotion, meditation and penance is to ma=\r\nnifest this spiritual viewpoint in our psyche/soul. When a compassionate he=\r\nart helps those in need it experiences untold divine bliss which is not equ=\r\nivalent to even all material joy of the world put together.&lt;br&gt;\n14) RADIANT=\r\n SKILLS: When there is a lack of radiant skills other qualities of ones psy=\r\nche lose their utility sheen and importance too. Man can swim in the infini=\r\nte ocean of glory only if he deeply imbibes gentlemanliness, humility, gene=\r\nrosity, sense of service (Seva Bhava) and fearlessness. A weak minded indiv=\r\nidual may be a gentleman and yet he never has the daring to oppose undesira=\r\nble trends in society. It is because of this that he fails to help benefit =\r\nthe world at large with his generous and wholesome character. Even minor hi=\r\nccups in life make him tensed and thus out of fear bows down to unruly and =\r\nillegal elements. Thus simply because he lacks daring all his other wholeso=\r\nme qualities become pale and useless. A point to note is that at any given =\r\npoint in time the number of dictators, autocrats and criminals has been in =\r\nthe minority and yet because they are fearless (in a demonic way) they achi=\r\neve their unethical goals.
