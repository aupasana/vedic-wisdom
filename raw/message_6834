Similarly, you =\r\nfirst\nneed to pick up basic Sanskrit skills, then you can put them to use i=\r\nn\nthe manner of your choosing. Narasimha once wrote &quot;Whether the final\ndest=\r\nination is Delhi or Agra or Benares, one at Kanya Kumari will have\nto first=\r\n start walking towards north&quot;.\n\nIn my opinion, start with one of the organi=\r\nzations that teaches\nconversational sanskrit (eg. Samskrita Bharati). They =\r\ntake a nice\nstaged approach ... most importantly, they have made it fun. I\n=\r\npersonally know many people who studied using this method ... with the\naid =\r\nof readily available sanskrit commentaries, they are easily able to read\ngi=\r\nta, kalidasa and even some veda mantras. Many of these students are\nnow stu=\r\ndying for their MA Sanskrit degree.\n\nBasic sanskrit skills are relatively e=\r\nasy ... you can make significant\nprogress in the beginning with minimal eff=\r\nort. If you are in the US or\nIndia, definitely attend one of Samskrita Bhar=\r\nati&#39;s residential camps\n(they have classes at all levels, including classes=\r\n for beginners).\nYou&#39;ll get to meet many people who are the product of this=\r\n system.\nYou&#39;ll believe it when you hear it and start speaking it :-)\n\n[ If=\r\n you are in the US, there are three more Samskrita Bharati\nresidential camp=\r\ns taking place in 2011. (i) Seattle at the end of\nJuly, (ii) Michigan at th=\r\ne beginning of August and (iii) New Jersey in\nthe beginning of September.
