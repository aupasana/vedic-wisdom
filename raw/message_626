If shakti is flow=\r\ning and one is unable to contain it, such things can happen. It does seem l=\r\nike you have an awakened and active shakti.\n \nHowever, you are wise to not =\r\nattribute it to yourself and try to not even think about it!\n \nHaving done =\r\nso much sadhana in this and prior lives to get a little bit of experience, =\r\npeople often let the experience bind them and block them from going further=\r\n! That is sad.\n \nIf one becomes possessive about an experience or thinks of=\r\n it as an achievement or thinks of it as a vindication of one&#39;s superiority=\r\n/progress or otherwise develops *any* kind of attachment to the experience,=\r\n then one gets stuck. This is a common pitfall with various experiences. A =\r\ntrue sadhaka should have complete surrender to the cosmic being and not all=\r\now the mind to think of *anything* as &quot;mine&quot; or &quot;I did it&quot;. Any attachment =\r\nor possessiveness about something - whether it is regarding a material obje=\r\nct such as a car or a wife or a child or body or whether it is regarding so=\r\nme knowledge such as physics or astrology or mantra shastra or whether it i=\r\ns regarding an experience such as seeing a deity or talking to a deity or h=\r\nearing a mantra internally or something like you described - only promotes =\r\npersonal ego and binds one. The only way to progress further is to reduce p=\r\nersonal ego further and not let the mind think of anything as &quot;mine&quot;.\n \n*  =\r\n      *        *\n \nMind&#39;s nature is to look at the objects of the world and=\r\n accumulate objects into a big pile labeled as &quot;mine&quot;. This is very difficu=\r\nlt to fight.\n \nWhen I went to India this summer, I and my guru visited seve=\r\nral places together. When I was at a specific place, there were some nice e=\r\nxperiences - probably my best experiences in this life so far. I realized s=\r\nome things. I had a strong sense of belonging and felt that that place was =\r\nmine and I used that place to do much work in my past life. After feeling t=\r\nhose emotions for a few seconds, I immediately realized my folly. Forget th=\r\ne past life, even my body, my belongings, my achievements and my actions in=\r\n *this* life are all not really mine. They belong to Her and I am just a te=\r\nmporary caretaker, like a servant takes care of the properties of a rich la=\r\nndlord. The goal of sadhana is to cut off the remaining ego and attachment =\r\nso that that realization becomes complete. Given that, what is the point is=\r\n bloating that ego by digging previous attachments that were long forgotten=\r\n? Whatever I was in the last life, whatever I built and whatever I did is n=\r\not mine. It was not mine then and it is not mine now. She did it using me t=\r\nhen and it was surrendered to Her. It is Hers even now. Once this confusion=\r\n cleared, I could focus and have a nice meditation session.\n \nOne should be=\r\n very vigilant about the kind of thoughts that enter mind. A feeble thought=\r\n today, when not checked carefully, may become a strong thought later and c=\r\nause problems.\n \nIn your case, please do not think about your experience an=\r\nd keep focusing on the sound of the mantra or on a vision of deity.\n \nBest =\r\nregards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n=\r\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3)=\r\n: http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.Sr=\r\niJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------ \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n  From: nalini swamy \n  To: vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday, November 09, 2008 11:29 PM\n  Subjec=\r\nt: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya- Narasimha garu\n\n\n  Dear N=\r\narasimha ji,\n  Namaskar.\n  I am happy that something *positive* emerged!!!\n=\r\n  Thank you for your guidance,\n  one other thing I wished to ask you and wo=\r\nuld you please answer if time permits?\n  One of my friends accidently touch=\r\ned the chair I was sitting in and felt a jolt of charge a few days back but=\r\n I did not attribute it to myself.

They just =\r\nmechanically chant it and nothing happens. What you described tells me that=\r\n you were able to experience the manta to some extent. That is a good sign.=\r\n\n\n  Though I have never done the mantra you mentioned, from the name, I wou=\r\nld imagine that this mantra makes energy flow in pingala nadi.\n\n  Different=\r\n mantras, when they work, force energy to flow in different subtle channel =\r\nof energy flow in our subtle body, resulting in the perception of a differe=\r\nnt &quot;experience&quot; to &quot;self&quot;. Some mantras (e.g. tryambakam yajaamahe) are ext=\r\nremely cooling and made energy flow in Ida (Chandra) nadi. Some mantras (e.=\r\ng. Savitri Gayatri) make it flow in Pingala (Surya) nadi.\n\n  When merely so=\r\nme vaayu (movement of air) enters a nadi also, there is some experience. Wh=\r\nen the entire energy of self-awareness (aka Kundalini) enters a nadi, it is=\r\n a very powerful experience and one&#39;s perception of self alters drastically=\r\n.\n\n  There are thousands of nadis in the body and thousands of possible exp=\r\neriences. The key is to NOT be distracted by the experience. Mystical exper=\r\niences are signs of spiritual progress, but they are also traps where we ca=\r\nn get stuck (i.e. not progress further). Do not think much about the experi=\r\nence. In a normal wakeful experience, our senses perceive various objects o=\r\nf the external world. We know that all that is just superficial and the rea=\r\nlity within all of them (i.e. Brahman) is imperceptible to senses. Similarl=\r\ny, whatever our inward-directed senses perceive (e.g. vision of a being, so=\r\nund of a mantra, feeling of heat from fire engulfing one etc) in an intense=\r\n meditation session is ALSO superficial (though perhaps less superficial th=\r\nan the objects we see in the external world usually) and the reality within=\r\n those experiences (i.e. Brahman) is experienced only when you transcend th=\r\ne superficial sense experiences.\n\n  While it is difficult, the right thing =\r\nto do when you feel like you described is to ignore it and keep the intense=\r\n mental focus on the mantra or on the deity. The good thing is that your ex=\r\nperience is a sign of spiritual progress and the bad thing is that it can d=\r\nistract you from the final goal.\n\n  Feeling hot while and *after* meditatio=\r\nn and fighting are signs of some diturbation in the pingala nadi. When the =\r\ncorresponding karmas are flushed out of the system, things may be fine.\n\n  =\r\nI am not really knowledgeable. With my guru&#39;s blessings, I have experienced=\r\n some things and realized some things. Then he told me to not hold back and=\r\n boldly declare answers to questions on spirituality and religion as if I j=\r\nust know. I just follow his word and do as he said. It is upto my guru and =\r\nthe Mother to impregnate my words with meaning as they are received by peop=\r\nle.

She =\r\nfelt her whole body was internally burning, though there was no fever. Her =\r\nrelation with her mom started getting bitter with constant fights etc..\n\n  =\r\n        Later after some days it reduced again.

I had a strong sense of belonging and felt that that place was mine \n=\r\nand I used that place to do much work in my past life. After feeling those =\r\n\nemotions for a few seconds, I immediately realized my folly. Forget the pa=\r\nst \nlife, even my body, my belongings, my achievements and my actions in *t=\r\nhis* life \nare all not really mine. They belong to Her and I am just a temp=\r\norary caretaker, \nlike a servant takes care of the properties of a rich lan=\r\ndlord.

It was a str=\r\nange \n          dream where she saw a little girl, naked, come and sit on h=\r\ner lap and \n          when she asked teh girl who she (the girl) was, the r=\r\neply came in \n          sanskrit. Now my friend does not know or even under=\r\nstand Sanskrit, so \n          she could not understand what the girl was sa=\r\nying. Then after some \n          time the girl in the dream kept repeating =\r\nwhat sounded like a mantra \n          in her ears.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;From next day m=\r\norning my friend started chanting that mantra, \n          after about one a=\r\nnd half years of chanting recently she did a sankalpa \n          for chanti=\r\nng and had experinces similar to the kind u described. She \n          felt =\r\nher whole body was internally burning, though there was no fever. \n        =\r\n  Her relation with her mom started getting bitter with constant fights \n  =\r\n        etc..&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;Later after =\r\nsome days it reduced again.
