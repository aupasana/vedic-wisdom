This feeling\n&gt; is what I endeavoured to overcome through Tapa for years.\n \nAs you correctly judged, I do identify with this body most of the time, except at the time of experiences like the one described below. All we can do is to endeavour to overcome it..\n \n&gt; This is the real Siddhi we should all strive for : Seal-realization.\n \nWhen this discussion on siddhis and shakti started a while back, that is essentially what I said. I am in full agreement with you.\n \nOf course, knowing intellectually is one thing, tasting it now and then is another and being it always is yet another! As you said, this requires Tapas. Having wrong goals like obtaining this siddhi or that siddhi or physical immortality does not help one in that.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Vinay Jha &lt;vinayjhaa@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; I can sometimes open my gmail account, but not always, due to my\n&gt; anability to live near any town. I cannot open yahoo groups. When I\n&gt; get a good internet connection, I may try to see vedic-wisdom.\n&gt;\n&gt; I like to hear and read spiritual talks by others, but I really\n&gt; dislike describing my experiences. The reason is simple : most of the\n&gt; persons will not believe and therefore it will serve no worthwhile\n&gt; purpose. In your message above, I read &quot;I am the body&quot;. This feeling\n&gt; is what I endeavoured to overcome through Tapa for years. Due to my\n&gt; efforts of self-purification, which included overcoming Deep Sleep and\n&gt; ensure constant Japa even throughout night, I was blessed with the\n&gt; visits of many deities and siddhas and it will be foolish to describe\n&gt; these experiences to everone. I was gaining some siddhis, but I left\n&gt; that road due to some unsavoury incidents. The only siddhi, if you can\n&gt; call it a siddhi, that I gained through Tapa and Blessings and which I\n&gt; want to keep is my enhanced capacity to judge things, books, persons\n&gt; and events. Earlier, I wasted years torn in the horns of the dilemma\n&gt; of to be or not to be a part of the false melodrama known as Samsaara,\n&gt; lingering in the labyrinths of Doubts of all sorts. I got the correct\n&gt; answer later : To be AND not to be at the same time. To be, but with a\n&gt; Saaksheebhaava. To watch not only others, but our own actions and\n&gt; thoughts, dreams, etc, as a mere Onlooker and not as a participant;\n&gt; hence Not to be too. Shri Mad-Bhaagavata says : &quot;aashaa hi paramam\n&gt; duHkham, nairaashyam paramam sukham&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; One personal experience I want to share is that the Ego I was thinking\n&gt; as my real Self got detached from me long ago, but I have not got good\n&gt; riddance from it : it now abuses me but I do not care for it. I\n&gt; sometimes keep a pretence of Ego to deal with worldly persons, but the\n&gt; real Ego is a detached powerless entity watched by me. Years ago, once\n&gt; I felt my existence sinking down at night. I asked my\n&gt; Upastha/Jananendriya to come up; it answered : Brahmaa ji made my\n&gt; place at bottom, how can I come up?? Then I realized my folly. The\n&gt; Praana should come up. Others may laugh at me, but the fact is that I\n&gt; could hear my indriyas and could talk to them as if they were separate\n&gt; beings!! I gradually realized that they accompany me from time\n&gt; immemorial, but I do not really belong to them, or to this ephemeral\n&gt; Body.\n&gt; This is the real Siddhi we should all strive for : Seal-realization.\n&gt; Japa, tapa, homam, dhyaana, etc are all means. The end is Constant\n&gt; Self-Awareness, awareness of the real Self which is omnipresent,\n&gt; omniscient, disinrested and detached, yet one with everone. Veda does\n&gt; not differentiate between individual soul and God. Last verse of White\n&gt; YV : &quot;yo asau Aaditya purushaH so asau aham&quot;. This normal state of\n&gt; Atman is sama-aadhi, opposed to egoistical state which is Vyaadhi.\n&gt; Both states can be easily attained and retained, provided constant\n&gt; practice is made. Vyaadhi or Vyutthaana is easier due to past habits\n&gt; of mind and indriyas. That is why Tapa is required for Samaadhi.\n&gt; Samaadhi needs statue-like fixation of the body as well as of the\n&gt; mind, which can be attained only through Tapa for normal humans. But\n&gt; most of the mortals in Kaliyuga want shortcuts to evade Tapa. They do\n&gt; not know that real Dhyaana is a painful Tapa till it becomes a normal\n&gt; habit of the purified mind, after which dhyaana opens the road to\n&gt; Bliss. No worldly pleasue can be compared to the siritual bliss when\n&gt; Soul is Itself and Only Itself.\n&gt; -vj\n&gt;\n&gt; On 12/12/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am forwarding the reply from Sri Vinay Jha, a monk in north India. Though\n&gt; &gt; he cc&#39;ed his reply to vedic-wisdom, it was not delivered because he is not a\n&gt; &gt; member. So I am forwarding it (see below).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; To members: In my limited interactions with him over the last few months, I\n&gt; &gt; have seen that he is a man with good understanding and clear thinking. I\n&gt; &gt; usually do not have any significant disagreement with him in spiritual\n&gt; &gt; matters. Any difference between what we say is often because we may be using\n&gt; &gt; different words or looking at things from different angles, but not because\n&gt; &gt; of fundamental differences.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vinay ji summarized it beautifully:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Body is primarily a means to fulfil desires. Those who have conquered\n&gt; &gt;&gt; desires are in no need of body. But then they get siddhis!! What an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; irony ! Those who run after siddhis do not get anything.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ... Striving after siddhis is the greatest folly. Siddhis are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; actually distractions which test the power of a yogi to concenrrate.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; All kinds of siddhi are possible. They should neither be avoided nor\n&gt; &gt; pursued. Take what comes your way, but do not desire anything. There should\n&gt; &gt; be NOTHING that you hold as &quot;I wish I had this&quot; or &quot;I wish I did NOT have\n&gt; &gt; this&quot;, for any attraction or aversion will block you! As Vinay ji rightly\n&gt; &gt; says, the irony is that one running after siddhis is often deprived of any,\n&gt; &gt; while one without desires may be tempted with this siddhi or that siddhi so\n&gt; &gt; that desire may be reborn! Only after one passes all tests and attraction\n&gt; &gt; and aversion are not born in any circumstances is one truly free. The above\n&gt; &gt; paragraph is a good summary of this discussion.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Vinay ji is wise in not wanting to talk about personal experiences. I share\n&gt; &gt; a few of them as they are useful in highlighting some notions and some\n&gt; &gt; lessons and in inspiring and cautioning sadhakas. I am quoting a portion\n&gt; &gt; from http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/3481:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ------------ Begin Quote ------------\n&gt; &gt; I was sleeping oneday. In the middle of the night, I woke up. When I was\n&gt; &gt; still on the bed and partially awake, my shakti rose. In other words, my\n&gt; &gt; self-awareness got refined. I first perceived a tremendous bolt of\n&gt; &gt; electricity going up in my back. Then, in a split second, my perception of\n&gt; &gt; that electricity changed from &quot;shakti inside me&quot; to &quot;I inside shakti&quot;. My\n&gt; &gt; changed perception was that there was a tremendous amount of shakti that was\n&gt; &gt; surging up like an ocean wave and encompassing everything that was there and\n&gt; &gt; that I was a very tiny particle in that tremendous wave. Moreover, I also\n&gt; &gt; &quot;heard&quot; a specific beejaakshara being chanted together by millions of\n&gt; &gt; people, who were all tiny particles in that wave. That wave reverberated\n&gt; &gt; with the sound of that beejaakshara and I perceived that I too was chanting\n&gt; &gt; that beejaakshara along with all. My mind was filled with that sound and a\n&gt; &gt; kind of bliss. My self-awareness was that of a tiny particle filled with\n&gt; &gt; that sound and joy and nothing else. I was unaware of anything else.\n&gt; &gt; Compared to my normal mental state, it was a very simple and yet fantastic\n&gt; &gt; state to be in. I was in that state for a while. Suddenly a thought that can\n&gt; &gt; be loosely expressed as &quot;Amn&#39;t I on the bed in a room? How am I hearing this\n&gt; &gt; loud sound? Are there people in the room&quot; came to my mind. That thought\n&gt; &gt; disturbed the state of my mind and my shakti came down. In other words, I\n&gt; &gt; returned to the regular level of self-awareness and again perceived that I\n&gt; &gt; was a body lying on a bed in a room. The bliss was gone and mind was again\n&gt; &gt; filled with hundreds of thoughts as usual.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I mentioned this incident a few days later to Manish. When this happened, it\n&gt; &gt; was the middle of the night for me and morning for Manish. When I mentioned\n&gt; &gt; the incident and said that I heard the sound of a beejaakshara reverberating\n&gt; &gt; in the wave in which I was a small particle, Manish immediately said he knew\n&gt; &gt; it and also mentioned the specific beejaakshara and asked &quot;that is what you\n&gt; &gt; heard, right?&quot; That was indeed correct. Moreover, I had never meditated with\n&gt; &gt; that beejaakshara before and it is not something one would expect me to have\n&gt; &gt; a mystical experience with.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When I confirmed that was the beejaakshara I heard, Manish shed some light:\n&gt; &gt; &quot;I was at that time meditating with that beejaakshara. So and so deity came\n&gt; &gt; and filled my consciousness. I then went into a nice samadhi. Some people\n&gt; &gt; close to me may also have experienced that deity at that time. But we should\n&gt; &gt; realize that this is all Her play and we are just nimittas. What she does\n&gt; &gt; and why she does, she knows and we do not. We are just dummies observing\n&gt; &gt; what comes our way. We neither make anything happen nor should we desire\n&gt; &gt; anything to happen. Just be and observe. Do not be attracted or repelled by\n&gt; &gt; anything.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; ------------- End Quote -------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Making someone who is thousands of miles away (especially one who is leading\n&gt; &gt; a normal mundane life and has many bad samskaras!) have a specific sublime\n&gt; &gt; experience is not an ordinary feat. Few can do such things today. However,\n&gt; &gt; look at the attitude of the person who did it. See what he said in the last\n&gt; &gt; paragraph quoted above about being just a nimitta! Rather than thinking of\n&gt; &gt; siddhis or striving for them, strive for cultivating such an attitude!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The important thing is not whether one gets siddhis or not. That is\n&gt; &gt; irrelevant. The important thing is whether one is fully prepared and mature\n&gt; &gt; enough to handle any siddhis! If one is prepared, one may get control over\n&gt; &gt; the entire universe and yet remain detached and be liberated. If one is\n&gt; &gt; unprepared, even a very very minor siddhi may make one fall and get stuck in\n&gt; &gt; the cycle of birth, pursuit of desires and paybacks and death. Sadhakas\n&gt; &gt; should forget about irrelevant things and strive for the correct attitude\n&gt; &gt; that can take them far.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Date: Sun, 12 Dec 2010 00:05:35 +0530\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Re: Gorakhnath, Naths and Dattatreya (Re: On Physical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Immortality)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: Vinay Jha &lt;vinayjhaa@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Cc: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,\n&gt; &gt; silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt;, Lalit Mishra\n&gt; &gt; &lt;mishra.lalit@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; PVR is correctly expressing the essence of Vedic philosophy, but\n&gt; &gt;&gt; physical immortality and greater miracles are possible by siddhas.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Swami Ramakrishna Paramhamsa&#39;s guru Swami Totapuri deliberately left\n&gt; &gt;&gt; his body after completing one Divine Year on Earth, equal to 360 human\n&gt; &gt;&gt; years. One of his disciples whom I knew personally requested the guru\n&gt; &gt;&gt; not to leave his discipes, but Totapuri ji said that though he could\n&gt; &gt;&gt; live as long as he wishes, this world is not for siddhas. There is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; another world for them.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I know siddha of Nath sampradaya now living in the Shiva Temple near\n&gt; &gt;&gt; a creamation ground in Jammu. He can create matter out of nothing, and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; talk from great distances telepathically. I know some siddhas of other\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sampradaayas too. None of them wants physical immortality, but it is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; attainable. Even BPHS talks of Amitaayu.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Appearing simultaneously at many places is not physical replication.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Brahma-sutra talks about Nirmaana-kaayaa. Sooksma Deha can be created\n&gt; &gt;&gt; by siddhas at will and for lesser mortals these dehas are no less real\n&gt; &gt;&gt; than physical body. To remove my skepticism, my late Guru ji had shown\n&gt; &gt;&gt; me many exaples of controllong matter from 50 kilometres away. I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; personally know many living Antaryaamis who are perfect clairvoyants\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and more. To mortals addicted to senses, physical body or physical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; world is everything, but those who soar above regard the physical as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; maayaa because it can be ceeated by Kalpanaa of a siddha. The whole\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Creation is a Kalpa.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Body is primarily a means to fulfil desires. Those who have conquered\n&gt; &gt;&gt; desires are in no need of body. But then they get siddhis!! What an\n&gt; &gt;&gt; irony ! Those who run after siddhis do not get anything.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have some experience of these things, but I do not like to talk\n&gt; &gt;&gt; about personal experiences. It is wrong to say that Jnaana or Kriya\n&gt; &gt;&gt; yogacannot bring siddhis. All types of real Yoga can bring siddhis.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; But as the saying goes, those who strive to become saints become\n&gt; &gt;&gt; satans. Striving after siddhis is the greatest folly. Siddhis are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; actually distractions which test the power of a yogi to concenrrate.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -vj\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On 12/11/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Please do not get carried away with this verse. Naths are also known as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Mahasiddhas. These are not ordinary beings. Nath means Lord or master.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Depending on how you count them, there are either 64 or 9 of them,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; incarnated from various transcendental qualities of the Lord. These are\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; adept beings with perfect mastery over various aspects of the field of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duality. They are ever-liberated and yet are born again and again to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; show\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the path of liberation to people.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Lord Dattatreya is the original guru of all Naths. Please read his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Avadhoota Gita&quot;. There is a nice English translation by Swami\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Asokananda (I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; think) of Ramakrishna Mutt, which does justice. But, it is better if one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; knows Sanskrit and reads Sanskrit verses directly, because there is some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; special power in the combinations of words used and reading them in that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; form has a special impact. If one reads Avadhoota Gita, one will realize\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that what I&#39;ve been writing on the goal of sadhana is consistent with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Avadhoota Gita says. So is it with what Maharshi Vasishtha says in Yoga\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Vaasishtham!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; While Dattatreya says &quot;I am this body, I am that body and I am all\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bodies\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; and yet I am not a body&quot;, it is unwise to think that Gorakshanath (from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dattatreya&#39;s lineage!) would set as ultimate goal making a specific body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; immortal. This is a gross misrepresentation of Gorakshanath and his\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; teachings. In fact, anynody who thinks one can understand the essence of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nath&#39;s teaching from a book or a verse is fooling oneself. Only those\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; who\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are meant for it can benefit from the guidance of a Nath. Others can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; only\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; see the superficial aspects of the words attributed to a Nath. To say\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Gorakhnath&#39;s path is about achieving &quot;Kayasiddhi&quot; is totally wrong.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Gorakshanath&#39;s path is about liberation while living, which is described\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Avadhoota Gita, Yoga Vaasishtham and several other scriptures, and that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; does\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; NOT mean physical immortality.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; One understanding the true essence of the teachings of Gorakshanath,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Matsyendranath and Dattatreya and following their teachings perfectly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; may\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; indeed get various siddhis though one may not actively want them. As\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Vasishtha says in Yoga Vaasishtham, various siddhis in the field of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duality\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are irrelevant to a seeker of liberation and they can even become\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; hindrances. But, one truly understanding the teachings of Naths and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dattatreya will not succumb to them and will become like Shiva. My point\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that one who starts off thinking that physical immoortality of a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; specific\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; physical body (or another siddhi like that) is the goal is going to get\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; stuck at some stage.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Liberation is lack of attraction or aversion to anything in the field of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; duality - an object or an idea or a notion. Either rejection of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; everything\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; as an illusion or acceptance of everything as divine can make one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; eventually\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; overcome all attractions and aversions. Thinking of immortalizing one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; particular physical body will not help one with that. In fact, a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; realized\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; person will not think &quot;I am this body&quot;, as the quote above from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dattatreya\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; shows.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; In fact, the verse quoted below says one becomes like Shiva in the end.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Did\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Shiva strive for physical immortality? When Shiva came to earth as Adi\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Shankara, he did not teach physical immortality. Instead, he taught that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; body is mithya (an illusion).\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; As I said, siddhas like Trilinga Swami could manifest their physical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; bodies\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in two places at the same time. Why Trilinga Swami, my guru&#39;s guru (Sri\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nakhate Maharaj) did that. Oneday, my guru Manish saw his guru standing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; front of him in physical body, showing hand in a blessing pose and then\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; waving it as a good bye sign. Manish later found out that other\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; disciples of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Nakhate maharaj living in various parts of the world saw a similar scene\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the same time and that Maharaj gave up his physical body in Pune at that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; time! If one is indeed a siddha (let alone a natha) and has some control\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; over matter, it may be possible to menifest and unmanifest perishable\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; physical bodies at will. Where does physical immortality stand in that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; context?!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ---- silentadmirer_in &lt;silentadmirer_in@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaskar,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; Just a thought on the path of Gorakhnath.

Neither viewpoint is correct.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ignoring the views of a stereotypical psudo-vedantin of today, we\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can see that vedanta in fact does not say physical body is to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ignored. It asks us *realize* that we are not the physical body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we are something else residing in a shell called the physical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What we truly are, can neither be created nor be destroyed,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical body may perish. But, if someone currently thinks that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is a physical body, one cannot simply ignore the physical body.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; has to *use* the physical body to eventually realize that one is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the physical body. A mere intellectual statement of it is not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tantamount to its realization.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Yoga Vaasishtham, Maharshi Vasishtha clearly says that action\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (karma) and knowledge (jnaana) are two wings with which the bird\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness flies into the sky of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; self-realization.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physical body is not to be ignored, but to be used skillfully and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carefully to perform the *right actions* that can free one.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As I said earlier, one performing actions without correct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (that god is the doer of all actions!) is like a person who is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; walking around a mountain not realizing that the goal of walking\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to reach the top. Such a person will keep walking forever and not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reach the top. On the other hand, one having the correct\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knowledge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not performing actions is like someone who knows that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; reaching\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the top of the mountain is the goal and keeps staring at the top,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; without walking. Such a person will remain at the base of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mountain. Thus, jnaana and karma alone are not able to free one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that is why Vasishtha compares them to two wings of a bird. The\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; equilibrium caused by action and knowledge is what takes us\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; towards\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; liberation.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physical bodies of some siddhas may indeed remain intact for a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; long\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time, like centuries or millennia. But, eventually, they too may\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; give up physical body. Someone mentioned Vallalar, but he gave up\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical body, didn&#39;t he?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Actually, to a truly liberated siddha, this discussion of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; physical\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; immortality will sound silly. Self is uncreated and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; indestructible,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but its modifications such as physical forms can be born and be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destroyed at will really. A siddha, as long as one does not merge\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brahman completely, can remain in an individualized *ethereal*\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; with a subtle ego, even after giving up a physical body. One can\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then create a physical body at will, then merge back in the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ethereal\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body after a few decades or centuries or millennia and so on. So,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; what is the whole point of physical immortality?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Trilinga Swami (aka Telang Swami) of Kashi was a perfected\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siddha.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He was a guru-bhai of Vimalananda. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; commented\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; during a visit to Varanasi that Trilinga Swami was Shiva himself.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhairavi Brahmani who came to Dakshineshwar and taught Tantra to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna was in the lineage of Trilinga Swami. Later, a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; grateful\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna revisited Kashi and fed Trilinga Swami a big\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; container\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; full of rice pudding with his own hands! During his imprisonment\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the British (for walking naked in Kashi), he was seen by some\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; guards\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to be in his cell and also walking on the prison compound wall at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the same time. Even when he finally decided to give up his body\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his disciples put his body in a container and threw it into\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ganges,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he was seen after a few minutes to walk on the other side.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To a realized being with a high enough command over duality,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; creation and destruction of physical body is not a big deal.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who thinks that a gold coin is special and needs to be\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; preserved\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; forever will struggle to do so. One who realizes that a gold\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coin, a\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gold chain, a gold ring, a golden arrow etc are all basically the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same (gold) can melt the coin and recreate it again. Preserving\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coin forever is an irrelevant goal.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The key point is this. Trilinga Swami did not get those abilities\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; because he wanted them or did a sadhana for them specifically.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The same non-dual Self fills us all. Whether X realizes non-dual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Self or Y realizes non-dual Self, the realization is the same.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if one retains individual ego-consciousness and interacts with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; field of duality, different possibilities are there. One may\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engage\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in various actions using a physical body and at the end drop the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ego-consciousness and merge in Brahman. Or, one may engage in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; various actions using a physical body, then give it up and tie\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ego-consciousness to an ethereal body and remain in a higher\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; realm\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for a long time. If so, one may re-enter a physical body from\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to time. But, all this is governed by one&#39;s caliber and evolution\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the field of duality. Though, all are the same at the non-dual\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; level, different beings have different caliber in the field of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; duality. A rishi or Vishnu or a siddha or a natha may not be the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; same as somebody else.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I like Aurobindo, but I am afraid he lent himself vulnerable to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; misinterpretation when it comes to divinization of matter. I say\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quite emphatically that physical immortality as an ideal and as\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; end goal of one&#39;s sadhana is a dangerous idea.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only worthy goal is to efface individual ego, realize Self\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if needed, engage with the world with a subtle ego and do\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whatever\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comes spontaneously. Once heavier conditioning is overcome,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nature\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; starts to show one the role one has to play. One should just play\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the role given to one well, instead of asking for this role or\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; role.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
