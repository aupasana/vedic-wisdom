For example, you find &quot;vaiShNavIM loka iha maadayantaaM&quot; the end of =\r\nDurga Sooktam. It says that Durga belongs to Vishnu and She deludes (or int=\r\noxicates) things in this universe. (Of course, please do not take the word =\r\n&quot;delude&quot; in a bad connotation here. If that delusion is absent, there would=\r\n only be non-dual Brahman and no field of duality and no concept of space/t=\r\nime, no objects, no I, no you at all. This delusion is neither good nor bad=\r\n. It is just there, that&#39;s all.)\n\nAlso, MahaLakshmi&#39;s 108 names contain &quot;na=\r\nvadurgaaM mahaakaaLIM brahmaviShNushivaatmikaaM&quot;. &quot;Durga of nine forms&quot; is =\r\na name of Mahalakshmi, i.e. nine forms of Durga are Mahalakshmi&#39;s different=\r\n manifestations!\n\nThe Vaishnava vs Shaiva vs Shaakta schisms are a product =\r\nof Kali yuga. Do not worry about the distinctions and compartmentalizations=\r\n that have some basis but are unfortunately amplified in the Kali yuga. For=\r\n example, Ramakrishna said that Krishna and Kaala are not really different =\r\n- he said Krishna is like Sun and Kaali is like the sunlight.\n\nBottomline: =\r\nWhen you invoke Vishnu or Lakshmi in fire, you can chant prayers of Durga a=\r\nnd make offerings too.\n\n* * *\n\nThough letting others make offerings in one&#39;=\r\ns homam fire is a very common practice today, ancient practice was that eac=\r\nh person performing homam would have a separate homa kundam and a separate =\r\nfire. Multiple people could chant mantras and handle/process offerings, but=\r\n one single person would start the fire and make offerings into it. I very =\r\nstrongly recommend sticking to this rule.\n\nLet me say a few words on the re=\r\nasoning behind this rule.\n\n* * *\n\nThe goal of all sadhana (spiritual practi=\r\nces) is &quot;yoga&quot;. Though people today think that &quot;yoga&quot; means physical jerks =\r\nand intricate postures, actually the literal meaning of Yoga is &quot;joining tw=\r\no in oneness&quot;.\n\nWhen one engages in bhakti yoga by praying to a deity, one =\r\nis trying to lose one&#39;s self-awareness and become one with a tiny particle =\r\nat the deity&#39;s feet. When one engages in praanaayaamas, bandhas etc of raaj=\r\na yoga (e.g. hatha yoga), one is trying to merge the praana and apaana vaay=\r\nus in oneness and merge Kundalini (self-awareness) in the supreme self-cons=\r\nciousness at Sahasrara chakra. When one engages in jnaana yoga, one is tryi=\r\nng to find (by the process of elimination) that which is permanent and impe=\r\nrishable and merge one&#39;s consciousness in oneness with it (instead of focus=\r\ning on impermanent and perishable objects such as body).\n\nAs I said, the go=\r\nal of all sadhana is some form of oneness or &quot;yoga&quot;. That is the same even =\r\nwith homam!\n\n* * *\n\nWhen one does homam, one is first trying to merge one&#39;s=\r\n bhootaagni (the basic fire controlling one&#39;s existence, self-awareness and=\r\n perception of the universe) with external fire. In the beginning, one may =\r\nfeel that there is just an *external* fire that is not connected to one&#39;s s=\r\nelf. But, as one does sadhana with fire regularly and forms an attraction f=\r\nor fire, a relationship is slowly formed. In the company of a strong extern=\r\nal fire, one&#39;s bhootaagni will be aroused and one&#39;s bhootaagni will have a =\r\nunion with the external fire oneday. In other words, one feels the external=\r\n fire to be connected to one&#39;s own internal fire of perception.\n\nThis yoga =\r\nor association will strengthen one&#39;s bhootaagni considerably and make it ca=\r\npable of perceiving various divine beings and divine energies present aroun=\r\nd one. This will eventually enable one to obtain yoga with different divine=\r\n energies and beings.\n\n* * *\n\nSuppose a young person is seriously intereste=\r\nd in a relationship with an experienced person and shows interest over a pe=\r\nriod of time. The experienced person may eventually take the young person u=\r\nnder the wing and build the relationship. Even if the young person does not=\r\n know how to do his/her part in the relationship, the experienced one may t=\r\neach the young one.\n\nSimilarly, when one tries to create a union between ex=\r\nternal homam fire and one&#39;s internal fire of existence and perception, it d=\r\noes not matter if one&#39;s internal fire is small or ineffective. If one persi=\r\nsts enough, external fire will guide the internal fire like an experienced =\r\npartner in a relationship. However, one has to be persistent and one has to=\r\n be serious.\n\n* * *\n\n[My apologies in advance if this analogy offends some =\r\nof you.]\n\nA lot of young boys may move with a woman and have a friendship. =\r\nBut, in order to have a union with her and get a child through her, one may=\r\n need to court her and cultivate an intimate relationship. Similarly, to ha=\r\nve a union with a homam fire and get subtle perception through it, one may =\r\nneed to cultivate an intimate relationship.\n\nIf several people are offering=\r\n things to fire, it is like a lot of boys moving with a woman. She may not =\r\nhave union with any of them there. If you handle the fire by yourself and d=\r\no not let others handle the fire, it is like having a personal and intimate=\r\n relationship with a woman. Just as the woman may have a union with the boy=\r\n who is pursuing her whenever she wants, external fire may have a union wit=\r\nh your internal fire whenever it wants. You just wait. But, one does not ma=\r\nke it faster by pursuing many women or going out with the woman with many f=\r\nriends always. Similarly, one does not make it faster by offering in homam =\r\nfire with many people.\n\nJust as a friend who accompanies a boy when he goes=\r\n out with a woman may misbehave and spoil the boy&#39;s chances with the woman,=\r\n a person who offers to (or otherwise handles) your homam fire can spoil yo=\r\nur chances of yoga with fire by having undesirable thoughts.\n\nWhenever you =\r\nstart homam fire, imagine it to be your internal fire. Offer in it sincerel=\r\ny. Do not let others offer in your homam fire or handle the fire. They can =\r\nchant along with you and watch, but not handle the fire.\n\n* * *\n\nEven if yo=\r\nu imagine the fire to be an external and do not imagine it to be your inter=\r\nnal fire, your internal fire may still be seeking a union with that fire wi=\r\nthout your knowing it consciously! Thus, it is not a good idea to let other=\r\ns offer in the fire.\n\n* * *\n\nIf internal fires of several people are lookin=\r\ng for oneness with the same external fire, their karmas will be mixed up an=\r\nd will block each of them from a oneness with it. None will experience &quot;Yog=\r\na&quot; with fire and their karmas will be mixed up.\n\nNon-dually speaking, exter=\r\nnal fire in homam kundam 1 and external fire in homa kundam 2 are the same.=\r\n But, that way, your internal fire and internal fire in a friend may also b=\r\ne the same. But, at the level of duality, your internal fire and that in a =\r\nfriend are different, carry the weight of different karmas and are conditio=\r\nned differently. So, they are different and need to seek union with a diffe=\r\nrent external fire.\n\n* * *\n\nBottomline: Apart from the concern about mixing=\r\n up karmas, one needs to cultivate the habit of doing homam in a personal h=\r\noma kundam with a personal fire in order to reach the goal of Yoga with fir=\r\ne (and thereby with a deity) oneday. One allowing others to make offerings =\r\nin the homam fire may block oneself from that goal. When you do homam, do n=\r\not start off assuming that you will never achieve god-union with homam. Ins=\r\ntead, do everything you can to maximize the chance of it.\n\nBest regards,\nNa=\r\nrasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyo=\r\ntish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; rit=\r\nual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg\nFilms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\nSpirituality: ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------\n\n---- Sunitha &lt;sunitha_macherla@...&gt; wrote: =\r\n\n&gt; Namaste, I would also like to recite Durga Suktam after performing Laksh=\r\nmi and Vishnusahasranama homa.

Similarly, one does not make it faster by offering in homam fire with man=\r\ny people.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nJust as a friend who accompanies a boy when he goes out=\r\n with a woman may misbehave and spoil the boy&#39;s chances with the woman, a p=\r\nerson who offers to (or otherwise handles) your homam fire can spoil your c=\r\nhances of yoga with fire by having undesirable thoughts.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nWhenever=\r\n you start homam fire, imagine it to be your internal fire. Offer in it sin=\r\ncerely. Do not let others offer in your homam fire or handle the fire. They=\r\n can chant along with you and watch, but not handle the fire.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n*  =\r\n      *        *&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nEven if you imagine the fire to be an external a=\r\nnd do not imagine it to be your internal fire, your internal fire may still=\r\n be seeking a union with that fire without your knowing it consciously! Thu=\r\ns, it is not a good idea to let others offer in the fire.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n*      =\r\n  *        *&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nIf internal fires of several people are looking for =\r\noneness with the same external fire, their karmas will be mixed up and will=\r\n block each of them from a oneness with it. None will experience &quot;Yoga&quot; wit=\r\nh fire and their karmas will be mixed up.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nNon-dually speaking, ex=\r\nternal fire in homam kundam 1 and external fire in homa kundam 2 are the sa=\r\nme. But, that way,  your internal fire and internal fire in a friend may al=\r\nso be the same. But, at the level of duality, your internal fire and that i=\r\nn a friend are different, carry the weight of different karmas and are cond=\r\nitioned differently. So, they are different and need to seek union with a d=\r\nifferent external fire.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n*        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nBottomline:=\r\n Apart from the concern about mixing up karmas, one needs to cultivate the =\r\nhabit of doing homam in a personal homa kundam with a personal fire in orde=\r\nr to reach the goal of Yoga with fire (and thereby with a deity) oneday. On=\r\ne allowing others to make offerings in the homam fire may block oneself fro=\r\nm that goal. When you do homam, do not start off assuming that you will nev=\r\ner achieve god-union with homam. Instead, do everything you can to maximize=\r\n the chance of it.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nBest regards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n--------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n  Free Jyotish Software, F=\r\nree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals =\r\nfor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n                  &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n     Films=\r\n that make a difference: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org/&quot;&gt;http://Sara=\r\nswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n     Spirituality: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n--=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n---- Sun=\r\nitha &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:sunitha_macherla%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;sunitha_macherla@y=\r\nahoo.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,  I would also like to recite Dur=\r\nga Suktam after performing Lakshmi and Vishnusahasranama homa.
