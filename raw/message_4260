Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; A few quick points:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) There is no absolut=\r\ne right and wrong. Dharma often requires judging and balancing different cr=\r\niteria and the judgment may vary from place to place, time to time and pers=\r\non to person.\n&gt; \n&gt; Uncooked (raw) rice grains last a long time without gett=\r\ning spoiled, but cooked rice grains get spoiled fast. Unfortunately, people=\r\n cannot eat raw grains. So someone cooks for them. Do not expect cooked gra=\r\nins to last a long time, even if a great cook cooked them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Similarly, =\r\ngeneric and raw spiritual teachings given in scriptures and taught by great=\r\n yogis (e.g. Brahman alone is real. World is maayaa. Do good to others. Sac=\r\nrifice your happiness for others) are relevant always, while very specific =\r\nguidelines given by great yogis in specific circumstances (e.g. It is ok to=\r\n eat fish, but focus mind on god. It is ok to do homam with mustard oil ins=\r\ntead of ghee. If someone comes to you and asks for money, give whatever you=\r\n have) may have been given keeping the circumstances in mind and may be irr=\r\nelevant in other circumstances.\n&gt; \n&gt; If I reject spoiled food cooked by my =\r\nwife who is out of town and instead eat food made by my sister-in-law, it i=\r\ns not disrespectful to my wife. She would not have expected me to hang on t=\r\no her food and eat it even after it expires.\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, many great=\r\n yogis give specific guidelines to people based on the circumstances (desa-=\r\nkaala-paatra), as people are not smart enough to know the right thing if gi=\r\nven only generic guidelines and want specific guidance. So they run the ris=\r\nk of someone using the guideline meant for a specific circumstance in other=\r\n inapplicable circumstances while attributing it to them.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) Eating t=\r\nhe meat of an animal that self-identifies with the body parts strongly is a=\r\nlways a much stronger karma than eating the stuff from plants that have muc=\r\nh subtler self-identification with the leaves and vegetables they grow. Irr=\r\nespective of which spiritual giants ate fish in the past, it is bad karma.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; All of us do many bad karmas and many good karmas and hope for them ba=\r\nlance out. Vivekananda and Ramakrishna did so many good karmas, so many aus=\r\nterities and such intense spiritual sadhana. It may have offset any bad kar=\r\nma accumulated by eating fish during the time they were not yet fully reali=\r\nzed (after full realization, there are no karmas).\n&gt; \n&gt; (3) In the old days=\r\n - even a century back - people did much more sadhana than now and lived si=\r\nmpler and purer lifestyles. Now-a-days, we live in the middle of deep pollu=\r\ntion - physical as well as spiritual - and our minds are bombarded with so =\r\nmuch corrupting influence. One may do a homam in the evening, go and turn o=\r\nn the TV and the sitcom coming on TV during prime time may have sexual innu=\r\nendo. One may check email and get a spam mail about sexuality. There are im=\r\nages of half-naked people and struggle for money everywhere. There are too =\r\nmany temptations for the mind and too many opportunities to fall and commit=\r\n bad karmas (physically or mentally). The world of today is more challengin=\r\ng for a sadhaka than at the time of Vivekananda.\n&gt; \n&gt; How good shoes one we=\r\nars may not matter if one is walking on a normal road in summer. One should=\r\n better wear good shoes if one is walking on an icy pavement during winter,=\r\n lest one should fall!\n&gt; \n&gt; When there is so much corrupting influence arou=\r\nnd us that we cannot control and that is challenging us, we can atleast con=\r\ntrol our own actions and habits and minimize the bad karmas we regularly co=\r\nmmit and the chance of a fall.\n&gt; \n&gt; (4) When Lord Vishnu came to earth as L=\r\nord Rama, he taught the importance of Eka Patni Vrata (having only one wife=\r\n). When he came back as Lord Krishna, he did not emphasize that anymore and=\r\n had many wives. When he came as Lord Narasimha or Lord Rama, he killed dem=\r\nons. When he came as Lord Buddha, he taught non-violence.\n&gt; \n&gt; When yogis l=\r\nike Ramakrishna, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharshi, Sai Baba etc come also, thei=\r\nr message is tuned for their desa-kaala-paatra. Different times require dif=\r\nferent leelas, different missions, different messages and different styles.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Unfortunately, Jaambavanta did not recognize when Lord Rama came back=\r\n as Lord Krishna and even fought with him!\n&gt; \n&gt; (5) While it is illogical t=\r\no hold Thakur, Mother and Swamiji accountable for the beliefs of these peop=\r\nle, I admire their blind faith. If it is opportunism, i.e. they just want t=\r\no eat fish and use the icons of their organization as an excuse, that is ba=\r\nd. But, if it is genuine blind faith that these icons were perfected beings=\r\n and their words are never wrong, they will eventually make it. Opportunist=\r\nic and egoistic faith is useless, but blind and complete faith accompanied =\r\nby complete surrender is very powerful. People with such faith WILL find th=\r\neir way.\n&gt; \n&gt; (6) The nearest path from Ujjain to Kashi does not go through=\r\n Calcutta. But, if someone insists on going through Calcutta, what can you =\r\ndo? Everyone takes a spiritual path based on one&#39;s conditioning. If we see =\r\na short path, we can only suggest it to others but nor force them to take i=\r\nt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------\n&gt; =C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish L=\r\nessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam=\r\n and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrolo=\r\nger.org\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://Sar=\r\naswatiFilms.org\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yaho=\r\no.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; =C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fri, 2/5/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] Re: Great Vimalananda&#39;s opinion on &#39;Meat-eaters&#39;(Aghor -at the left hand =\r\nof God)\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, February 5, 2010=\r\n, 9:38 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       =\r\n\n&gt;       \n&gt;       Dear KK,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Nice question. I was also thinking th=\r\nat.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Few days back when I went to Calcutta, (where fish is the st=\r\naple diet), one person told me confidently that there is no harm in eating =\r\nfish or meat because Swamiji used to do so, and in a Bengali book on the=C2=\r\n=A0life of Sri Ramakrishna there is one example mentioned where a man came =\r\nto ask him if should quite non veg food, and supposedly Ramakrishna said fi=\r\nrst leave &quot;Kamini&quot; and &quot;Kanchana&quot;, then think of food. =C2=A0Also a similar=\r\n examples was quoted to me from=C2=A0the life of Ma Sarada where - a certai=\r\nn book says - she advised an ordinary devotee against leaving fish eating a=\r\nnd rather just focus mind on God.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; When I tried to reason with th=\r\nem that if these people were to come back again on planet earth they may no=\r\nt recommend non veg eating - considering the state of the world today - I=\r\n=C2=A0 was catergorically told they are all Trikalagyas, so if there is som=\r\nething wrong in eating fish they would have told right then.=C2=A0 \n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; Then I tried to say that the examples maybe specific individual cases=\r\n, to which I was told, &quot;no&quot;, because based on a whole plethora of such exam=\r\nples even today the monks of the Ramakrishna Order in West Bengal eat and s=\r\nerve fish. This statement is a fact. I=C2=A0have had fish meals as prasad i=\r\nn many Ramakrishna Missions across=C2=A0West Bengal.=C2=A0So, I was told, t=\r\nhe monks of the Ramakrishna Oder know about teachings of Ramakrishna and Ma=\r\n Sarada better than us ordrinary people. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I could make no furthe=\r\nr arguments and of course had a harrowing time at home trying to convince m=\r\ny parents that I have quit non veg food. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; A lot of Bengalis may =\r\nnot have been able to implement the basic teachings of Ramakrishna in their=\r\n lives, however they faithfully follow fish eating as a sanction given by &quot;=\r\nThakur&quot; and &quot;Sri Sri Ma&quot; and &quot;Swamiji&quot;.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarsh=\r\ni\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; PS: No disrespect to anyone.

However, you are =\r\nfree to address me as you feel like and I&#39;ll happily accept it hence forth.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; I just came across Vimalananda&#39; s thought on Karma. He says (and Nara=\r\nsimha has many a times repeated) that Karma is only generated (Binding to o=\r\nne) when one self-identifies with it.\n&gt; Although, it may seem easy to under=\r\nstand intellectually, the state is multiple times difficult to achieve. Nev=\r\nertheless, it&#39;s an extremely important statement to answer our queries.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Important information about Vimalananda which I came to know only yesterd=\r\nay is that he was a big time smoker and there was not a single day passed i=\r\nn his life when he didn&#39;t do smoking except on the final day of his departu=\r\nre from physical body. He used to as well `chew Tobacco&#39; frequently and occ=\r\nasionally\n&gt;  ate meat. I gave this information, because as you pointed out =\r\n(and I also agree) that it is an interesting coincidence of exact thoughts =\r\ncrossing our minds. Further, please also note an important thing. The Aghor=\r\ni used to say very frequently to all his audience to do what he says and no=\r\nt try to do what he does.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now whatever I wrote above seems sufficient =\r\nto answer the questions you asked. Let me put in my thoughts further (Mind =\r\nyou, these are thoughts of an unrealized person and the worth can be next t=\r\no nothing). When we take example cases of Swami Vivekananda or Vimalananda =\r\nor Sainbaba or any other such acknowledged spiritual giants, we tend to for=\r\nget that they are all realized souls who achieved very high level of spirit=\r\nual realization. They are knower of everything or many things in the univer=\r\nse. Their individual ego is perfectly and completely tuned to universal ego=\r\n. In short they *know* what they are doing. They are `Trikaal gnyaanis&#39;.\n&gt; =\r\n Relevant to our topic of discussion, I would say that if they ate meat or =\r\nsmoke cigar or chew tobacco or killed animals, they actually knew what they=\r\n are doing. There would be surely a specific purpose behind each and every =\r\naction of theirs because as I said, they know complete background behind th=\r\neir each action and moreover their self identification is missing from the =\r\naction and hence it is like Nature operates through them to accomplish a sp=\r\necial purpose without binding them in any cause-effect chain.\n&gt; Ramakrishna=\r\n used to frequently say to all his disciples that Naren is very different f=\r\nrom others. He has a blazing spiritual fire burning within him which can co=\r\nnsume anything and everything. A food restriction does not bind him. He can=\r\n eat anything without getting spiritually troubled but for others, a kind o=\r\nf food intake is extremely important.\n&gt; If Vivekananda ate meat during his =\r\nstay in west, it&#39;ll surely have some subtle purpose which is not\n&gt;  possibl=\r\ne for majority of us to comprehend unless explained by a person of that lev=\r\nel. He might be removing `guilt&#39; from the sincere seekers amongst westerner=\r\ns so that he can be accepted by them as one of them and then slowly try to =\r\neradicate their habits of meat eating and such other undesirable habits. It=\r\n is also possible at the same time that he is nullifying some balanced Rina=\r\nnubandha with the `Animal&#39; whose meat he ate. It is also possible that he w=\r\nould have showered his unseen blessings on the animal&#39;s soul by consuming i=\r\nts meat. It&#39;s possible that there were no apparent reasons for that but jus=\r\nt a natural inconsequential act. We&#39;ll not know. Only Vivekananda, His Guru=\r\n and Mother Nature know. By the way Vivekananda saved a boy from drowning i=\r\nn a lake in USA while he was still in India and did not even planned to go =\r\nto USA. When the boy, after some years actually met Swami in USA for the fi=\r\nrst time, swami immediately told him to stay away from water\n&gt;  and when he=\r\n requested swami to accept him as his disciple, swami, after a moments thou=\r\nght told him that he is not his guru and his guru will come later and will =\r\ngive him Silver Cup as a gift. That man later became disciple of Paramhansa=\r\n Yogananda and after 40 years, he was actually given a gift of Silver-cup b=\r\ny Yogananda which literally fulfilled what swami Vivekananda `knew&#39; before =\r\n40 years.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Vivekananda was all knowing and most of us are NOT.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; So moral of my whole writings is that it&#39;s unwise as well as self deludi=\r\nng to take excuses of the unconventional habits of Swami Vivekananda, Shird=\r\ni Sainbaba, Vimalananda, Gajanana Maharaj, Swami Samarth, Trailang Swami an=\r\nd such masters and justify our completely self identified and utterly selfi=\r\nsh cruel/unjust actions.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-w=\r\nisdom@\n&gt;  yahoogroups. com, krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Great coincidence of thoughts!!=C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0I was about to ask this question today on Non-Veg eating.=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0 It is clear from the below passage meat eating is not advisable for any=\r\none.=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I was=C3=82=C2=A0reading a book on Swami Vivekananda (=\r\nNaa Athma Kadha - in Telugu), he clearly wrote that he survived many days o=\r\nn just eating meat when he was living in USA also relished it.
