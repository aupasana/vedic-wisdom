There need not be a big or famous=\r\n temple nearby. Buy a \nfew acres of land (for possible expansion in future)=\r\n and construct a \nhoma kundam built in open space with four pillars on the =\r\nfour sides \nand a high roof on the top to protect from rain. The area is op=\r\nen on \nall the four sides and covered only on the top. Close to it, a small=\r\n \none or two room structure is built to store materials.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; A pries=\r\nt or a sadhaka is employed. His main qualification is that \nhe should be a =\r\nsincere devotee of the Mother and interested in a \nsimple lifestyle dedicat=\r\ned to Her. His job is to do one Chandi homam \nin the morning, one more in f=\r\norenoon, have lunch, relax in the \nafternoon and do one more Chandi homam i=\r\nn the evening. Keep doing it \nday in and day out. There are no idols to wor=\r\nship and no other \nrituals to do.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; This=C2=A0will pretty much tak=\r\ne up all his time and hence enough money \nshould be arranged to take care o=\r\nf the priest and his family. If the \npriest is not well-versed in homam or =\r\nChandi homam, that is no \nproblem. He can be trained. But, the most importa=\r\nnt thing is that he \nshould be committed to this and devoted to the Mother.=\r\n If one has \nthe basic simplicity, innocence, devotion=C2=A0and purity, oth=\r\ner things \nwill fall in place by themselves.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Buying of the land =\r\nand construction of room and homa kundam (with \nroof and pillars) is a one-=\r\ntime expense. Salary of the priest and \nmaterials like ghee, wood etc for h=\r\nomam are an ongoing expense. This \nproject requires a good amount of money =\r\nand energy.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; After a center is establi=\r\nshed and sadhana progresses in each \ncenter, slowly the presence of Mother =\r\nwill be established there. \nOnce that happens, the sadhaka will start makin=\r\ng faster progress. As \nhe becomes purer and purere, the sadhana will genera=\r\nte more and more \nenergy.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; After establishing 4 other centers, a =\r\ncenter in Ujjain is to be \nstarted. The sadhana being done at the Chandi ho=\r\nmam centers will \nhave a catalytic influence on the homam movement and many=\r\n many \npeople will start doing different kinds of homas around the world. \n=\r\nThis will have a major impact on dharma in the world.

Someone sent me a few snippets \nfrom an \n&gt; interview posted on her=\r\n website. Please see below.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is interesting that she considers Ramak=\r\nrishna Paramahamsa as \nher guru. It \n&gt; is interesting that Ramakrishna told=\r\n her she had to &quot;do fire \nceremonies and \n&gt; show what is truth&quot; and &quot;at tha=\r\nt time the whole world will be \npeace&quot;. This \n&gt; is similar to what my guru =\r\nwas told by Divine Mother when she \nappeared to \n&gt; him during Shata Chandi =\r\nhomam at Chennai.\n&gt; \n&gt; She told him that many people are and will be born w=\r\nho will \nperform a short \n&gt; fire ritual on a regular basis, establish sanat=\r\nana dharma and \npeace in the \n&gt; world and also make quick spiritual progres=\r\ns individually in that \nprocess. \n&gt; Shree Maa&#39;s statement about what Ramakr=\r\nishna told her is along \nsimilar \n&gt; lines.\n&gt; \n&gt; My guru was also told by Mo=\r\nther that a few centres of regular \nChandi homam \n&gt; should be established a=\r\nround the world, where Chandi homam is done \n3 times a \n&gt; day. These places=\r\n do not need to be near any temples or famous \nplaces and \n&gt; can be anywher=\r\ne. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, \nthere is no \n&gt; need to o=\r\nffer silk sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with bare \nminimum \n&gt; offerin=\r\ngs is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times \neveryday. When a \n&gt; few=\r\n such centres are established, it will apparently lead to a \nchain of \n&gt; ev=\r\nents that will help re-establish sanatana dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though not 3 times a=\r\n day, these people have done a Chandi homam \neveryday for \n&gt; 3 years in the=\r\n same place and finished 1000 such homas. That is \nfantastic! \n&gt; It is the =\r\nsadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy and \nbrings \n&gt; deities t=\r\no a place. While several ancient temples are without any \ndivine \n&gt; presenc=\r\ne these days, new places of divine presence may be created \nby pure \n&gt; soul=\r\ns engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the \nworld.\n&gt; \n&gt; A=\r\ns I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shata Chandi homam \nduring which=\r\n \n&gt; Mother appeared and gave instructions to my guru on spreading \nhomam wa=\r\ns \n&gt; taken on Ramakrishna&#39; s birth anniversary and the time of sankalpa \nwa=\r\ns within \n&gt; a few minutes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of the birth =\r\n\nanniversary. \n&gt; All of this was a coincidence and we were unaware of this =\r\n\nsignificance when \n&gt; we decided the muhurta. It is interesting to know tha=\r\nt Ramakrishna \ndid \n&gt; mention fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and =\r\nthat his \nwords are \n&gt; similar to the words of Mother.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;=\r\n Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do=\r\n Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \ntarpana\n&gt; Spiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lesso=\r\nns (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Win=\r\ndows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website=\r\n: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- - \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; She considers Shri Ramakrishna as her\n&gt; &gt; Ma=\r\nster, has a small ashram here near the Bay Area\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Now here is the ver=\r\ny interesting part (snippets from her website\n&gt; &gt; pasted for your benefit),=\r\n from an interview found here\n&gt; &gt; http://www.shreemaa .org/drupal/ taxonomy=\r\n_ menu/54/86\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Shree Maa: Ramakrishna, my Guru, was tellin=\r\ng, &quot;You have to go \nnow for\n&gt; &gt; our country, and all other country, you hav=\r\ne to go do fire \nceremonies\n&gt; &gt; and show what is truth, what is dignity, an=\r\nd at that time the \nwhole\n&gt; &gt; world will be peace.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Her=\r\n main disciple is Swami Satyananda Saraswati (of American \ndescent),\n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nat same page describes his background, how he met her and all \nthat;\n&gt; &gt; bu=\r\nt another interesting snippet in there:-\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;At a time when jou=\r\nrneying throughout Middle Asia was arduous at \nbest,\n&gt; &gt; he had traveled an=\r\n unbeaten path to India&#39;s interior where he \nstudied\n&gt; &gt; with a number of g=\r\nurus, coming to embrace the worship of Chandi \nand\n&gt; &gt; the sacred fire cere=\r\nmony, the yagya, as his primary system of \nworship\n&gt; &gt; and meditation, whil=\r\ne undertaking great austerities in the \nprocess.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;snip&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &quot;They unde=\r\nrtook the Sahasra Chandi Yagya, a three year fire \nceremony\n&gt; &gt; and worship=\r\n of the Goddess, without setting foot outside from the\n&gt; &gt; humble temple gr=\r\nounds they established in Martinez, California.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;/snip&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
