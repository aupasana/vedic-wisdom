After 2-3 hrs of burning the tip of the b=\r\nurning wick gets burned and forms small charcoal ball and the flame becomes=\r\n small. In night it got extinguished coz of same issue. \n\nfor maintaining a=\r\nkhand jyot it seems one has to increase the wick length for burning and rem=\r\nove burnt ball on top of wick every 5-6 hrs. this doesnt seem practical. i =\r\nthink i might be doing something wrong.\n\nPlease guide. \n\nregards\npriyank\n\n\n"}}
