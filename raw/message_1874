Whatever astrology we practise is only and purely a lo=\r\ngical exercise. \n&gt; \n&gt; I had the good luck of coming across a man who was po=\r\nssibly the most spiritually advanced person I have come across till date, w=\r\nho could tell things with such pin point accuracy that it would put any ast=\r\nrologer to shame. \n&gt; \n&gt; So intution is a far better way of predicting the f=\r\nuture, if one can acquire that. And since our astrology mostly rests on log=\r\nical with little or no intution, it could be the reason why we make mistake=\r\ns.\n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly, to assume that political people have a higher degree of f=\r\nreewill (less binding prarabdha karma) does not make sense. I  believe free=\r\nwill and destiny have a strange relationship. The more freewill I use today=\r\n, will increse my destiny at a later date such that I won&#39;t have much maneu=\r\nverability left. So that means a political person must have used less amoun=\r\nt of freewill inhis previous birth to be able to use more of it now. But th=\r\nat seems improbable. A person who uses less freewill is a very spiritual pe=\r\nrson, he leaves things to God or takes things as it comes.. Politicians are=\r\n not exactly that way.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another thing with Indian polticians is that, m=\r\nany of them do actually indulge in employing people to do heavy duty tantri=\r\nk pujas etc to help them out. For example, when teh UPA Govt was facing the=\r\n no confidence motion last year, a very famous Indian politician sent a tea=\r\nm of tantriks to perform some pujas at the Ugra Tara temple in Kamakhya. Th=\r\ne homas lasted for 21 days with innumerable animal sacrifices. I know of qu=\r\nite a few other cases too. Of course the UPA Govt came out of the problem.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; All these do play a part without doubt.  \n&gt; \n&gt; An average astrologer s=\r\nees at least 10 times more nymber of ordinary charts than political charts.=\r\n Even in ordinary charts, mistakes WILL and do happen. But since the volume=\r\n of charts is more, we tend to see more successes. In the case of Political=\r\n charts, the volume is less,  therefore mistakes seem more pronounced. If w=\r\ne do a statistical analysis, we may see similar ratio of mistakes in both c=\r\nases (ordinary vs political charts).\n&gt; \n&gt; Therefore, the issue is with astr=\r\nology itself. The factors maybe way too many to be judged correctly only by=\r\n rules. Some genuine intution is must.\n&gt; \n&gt; Just my views.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =\r\nRajarshi\n \n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: Narasimha P.V.R. Rao \nTo: ve=\r\ndic-astrology@yahoogroups.com ; sohamsa@yahoogroups.com ; JyotishGroup@yaho=\r\nogroups.com \nSent: Monday, May 25, 2009 10:11 PM\nSubject: Horoscope, free w=\r\nill and high profile charts (Re: Your prediction on Chiranjeevi)\n\n\nNamaste,=\r\n\n\nI will share some freewheeling thoughts, in response to your question. I =\r\nam cc&#39;ing this to some astrology lists after removing your name from the ma=\r\nil.\n\n*        *        *\n\nFor those who are unaware of the prediction refer=\r\nred to below, here is a little background.\n\nI had predicted in print in 200=\r\n0 that Telugu film actor Chiranjeevi would come into politics in 2007-2009 =\r\nand and enjoy some political power. At the time of that prediction, there w=\r\nere no such indications on the ground. But he did come into politics in the=\r\n same timeframe. The initial talk was in 2007, he finally formed a party in=\r\n 2008 and elections were in 2009. Though his party did badly, he was electe=\r\nd as a legislator (MLA) in May 2009.\n\nThus, the original prediction was qui=\r\nte successful. However, I upped the ante last year by suggesting that Chira=\r\nnjeevi&#39;s party would do well in 2009 elections. Though I was not specific r=\r\negarding his level of success and did not predict that he would become the =\r\nChief Minister, I was honestly expecting his party to do better than they m=\r\nanaged. Thus, the followup of my original prediction is a failure.\n\n*      =\r\n  *        *\n\nIt is my personal observation that the success rate in high p=\r\nrofile political predictions is less than in regular predictions like marri=\r\nage, job, childbirth etc in &quot;regular&quot; charts.\n\nIn some cases, the reason is=\r\n that the birthdata is not accurate and yet we are eager to make prediction=\r\ns. But sometimes we make bad predictions with good data too. Of course, it =\r\ncan be a human error in judging various factors. However, that human error =\r\nseems to be a little more common in high profile political predictions than=\r\n in regular predictions. What could be the reason?\n\nI wonder if the factor =\r\nof free will that is left out of astrology plays a bigger role in political=\r\n charts. I will try to think loud and elaborate what I mean.\n\n*        *   =\r\n     *\n\nOne&#39;s birth chart contains the list of actions committed in previou=\r\ns lives using one&#39;s free will that are to give their reactions in this life=\r\n. However, as life goes on, one accumulates newer actions committed in THIS=\r\n life using one&#39;s free will. What happens at any point of time in one&#39;s lif=\r\ne is a function of ALL actions committed by one until that point of time, I=\r\nNCLUDING the actions committed in THIS life until now. Some key actions com=\r\nmitted using one&#39;s free will in THIS life, especially at important crossroa=\r\nds in life, should impact the life events from then onwards.\n\nMany people a=\r\nre weighed down by too many karmas and always playing a catchup. In other w=\r\nords, destiny (sum of the actions of previous lives which are to give a rea=\r\nction now) is too weighty and free will in this life has little scope. When=\r\n the options available for the free will in this life are limited, there ma=\r\ny not be significant actions using free will and hence the modifications to=\r\n destiny based on actions of this life may not be big enough. Thus, horosco=\r\npe may be sufficient to predict events.\n\nHowever, highly popular, successfu=\r\nl and high profile public personalities may have less restrictions and more=\r\n options available for their free will. With their free will being more fre=\r\ne and powerful, the actions committed by their free will may have a higher =\r\nweightage. As we are able to see only their destiny in the horoscope (free =\r\nwill exercised upto birth) and unable to factor in how free will was exerci=\r\nsed in this life until now, we are perhaps handicapped in our astrological =\r\npredictions.\n\nWhether a political leader is in limelight and becomes an MP =\r\nor the leader of opposition in parliament or the Prime Minister, he is enjo=\r\nying some political power. Previous karmas placed him in a position to enjo=\r\ny that power. To predict the specific degree of power and make an accurate =\r\nprediction, is the horoscope sufficient always? Could the exercise of free =\r\nwill in this life until now make a difference in some high profile charts?\n=\r\n\n*        *        *\n\nI am just thinking loud here. Rather than posing a qu=\r\nestion and answering it myself, I will let learned friends ponder on this f=\r\nor themselves...\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrolog=\r\ner.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFre=\r\ne Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish so=\r\nftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC)=\r\n website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- \n    Dear PV=\r\nR garu,\n\n        Namaste.\n\n        If you don&#39;t mind, could you please look=\r\n in to why your prediction on Chiranjeevi failed ?\n\n        I am not asking=\r\n this question with a wrong intent.

At the time \nof that prediction, there were no su=\r\nch indications on the ground. But he did \ncome into politics in the same ti=\r\nmeframe. The initial talk was in 2007, he \nfinally formed a party in 2008 a=\r\nnd elections were in 2009. Though his party did \nbadly, he was elected as a=\r\n legislator (MLA) in May 2009.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thus, the origi=\r\nnal prediction was quite successful. However, I upped the \nante last year b=\r\ny suggesting that Chiranjeevi&#39;s party would do well in 2009 \nelections. Tho=\r\nugh I was not specific regarding his level of success and did not \npredict =\r\nthat he would become the Chief Minister, I was honestly expecting his \npart=\r\ny to do better than they managed. Thus, the followup of my original \npredic=\r\ntion is a failure.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DA=\r\nrial size=3D2&gt;It is my personal observation that the success rate \nin high =\r\nprofile political predictions is less than in regular predictions like \nmar=\r\nriage, job, childbirth etc in &quot;regular&quot; charts.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fac=\r\ne=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;In =\r\nsome cases, the reason is that the birthdata is \nnot accurate and yet we ar=\r\ne eager to make predictions. But sometimes we make bad \npredictions with go=\r\nod data too. Of course, it can be a human error in judging \nvarious factors=\r\n. However, that human error seems to be a little&nbsp;more common \nin high =\r\nprofile&nbsp;political predictions than in regular predictions. What \ncould=\r\n be the reason?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I wonder if the factor of free will=\r\n that is left \nout of astrology plays a bigger role in political charts.

What happen=\r\ns at any point of time \nin one&#39;s life is a function of ALL actions committe=\r\nd by one until that point of \ntime, INCLUDING the actions committed in THIS=\r\n life until now. Some key actions \ncommitted using one&#39;s free will in THIS =\r\nlife, especially at important crossroads \nin life, should impact the life e=\r\nvents from then onwards.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FO=\r\nNT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Many people are weighed do=\r\nwn by too many karmas and \nalways playing a catchup. In other words, destin=\r\ny (sum of the actions of \nprevious lives which are to give a reaction now) =\r\nis too weighty and free will in \nthis life has little scope. When the optio=\r\nns available for the free will in this \nlife are limited, there may not be =\r\nsignificant actions using free will and hence \nthe modifications to destiny=\r\n based on actions of this life may not be big \nenough. Thus, horoscope may =\r\nbe sufficient to predict events.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;However, highly p=\r\nopular, successful and high \nprofile public personalities may have less res=\r\ntrictions and more options \navailable for their free will. With their free =\r\nwill being more free and \npowerful, the actions committed by their free wil=\r\nl may have a higher weightage. \nAs we are able to see only their destiny in=\r\n the horoscope (free will exercised \nupto birth) and unable to factor in ho=\r\nw free will was exercised in this life \nuntil now, we are perhaps handicapp=\r\ned in our astrological \npredictions.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial s=\r\nize=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Whether a poli=\r\ntical leader is in limelight and \nbecomes an MP or the leader of opposition=\r\n in parliament or the Prime Minister, \nhe is enjoying some political power.=\r\n Previous karmas placed him in a position to \nenjoy that power.
