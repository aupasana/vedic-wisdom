This is not right, for there can be no o=\r\nbligation incurred before one enters the order of a householder. According =\r\nto the text, =E2=80=9CLet one leave his home for the forest, and become a s=\r\nannyasin, even if he is a brahmacharin; let him immediately turn a sannyasi=\r\nn, either from home or from the forest.=E2=80=9D The order of the sannyasin=\r\n is enjoined even on one who is in the householder=E2=80=99s order. \nWe rea=\r\nd in the Chandogya Upanishad also that in the case of some people performan=\r\nce of agnihotra for twelve days, and subsequent renunciation, is enjoined. =\r\nAs for the argument that the order of a sannyasin is only for those who are=\r\n unable to perform karma, we say, it is unsound; as, in their case, there i=\r\ns the separate text of the sruti, =E2=80=9CHe who has discontinued the fire=\r\n or never maintained it,=E2=80=9D etc. If you say that it is immaterial whe=\r\nther one lives in his house or in the forest, we say, it is fallacious. Sel=\r\nf-denial alone being the matter of course with him, he cannot stay in the h=\r\nouse as that is prompted by desire, and self-denial is mere absence of it. =\r\nActing recklessly is entirely out of question with regard to the man of kno=\r\nwledge, for that is known to be the way of extremely ignorant persons.\nTher=\r\nefore the text =E2=80=9COnly doing karma, one should wish to live a hundred=\r\n years=E2=80=9D has been refuted by showing that the text applies to the ig=\r\nnorant, and that karma cannot coexist with knowledge. \n\n\n"}}
