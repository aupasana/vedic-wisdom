You seem to confuse my mind by apparently\nconflicti=\r\nng words. Tell me, decisively, one thing by which I may\nattain the Supreme.=\r\n (3.01-02)\n\nLord Krishna said: In this world I have stated a twofold path o=\r\nf\nspiritual discipline in the past. The path of Self-knowledge for the\ncont=\r\nemplative ones, and the path of unselfish work (Seva, Karma-yoga)\nfor all o=\r\nthers. (3.03)\n\nOne does not attain freedom from the bondage of Karma by mer=\r\nely\nabstaining from work. No one attains perfection by merely giving up\nwor=\r\nk, because no one can remain actionless even for a moment.\nEveryone is driv=\r\nen to action, helplessly indeed, by the forces of\nNature. (3.04-05)\n\nAnyone=\r\n, who restrains the senses but mentally dwells upon the sense\nobjects, is c=\r\nalled a pretender. (3.06)\n\n________________________________________________=\r\n________________\n\nThe Rishi Phenomenon\n\n&quot;When we look at the examples of th=\r\ne many great Rishis and sages of\nthe Dharma tradition, we witness an occurr=\r\nence that I term the &quot;Rishi\nPhenomenon&quot;. When a truly great sage finally ac=\r\nhieves liberation\nfrom the illusion of separation from God, he or she does =\r\nnot merely\nstop their activity there, content to merely live a life of isol=\r\nated\nbliss in self-realization. But, rather, they eventually look around\nth=\r\nemselves and see that others are not similarly experiencing that\ndivine sta=\r\nte of liberated bliss. They see that all beings are\nsuffering due to lack o=\r\nf spiritual insight. What then naturally\narises within the heart of the ris=\r\nhi as a result of his or her own\nBrahmic experience is a deep compassion fo=\r\nr all beings, and a\nyearning to help them. The rishi then takes on the task=\r\n of teaching\nothers the way of Dharma with the hope of elevating all sentie=\r\nnt\nbeings to a similar experience of the Divine. We too are meant to\nmanife=\r\nst the Rishi Phenomenon in our own lives and, with compassion\nfor all suffe=\r\nring beings, help others to experience their own\nspiritual self-unfolding. =\r\nTo not want to share spiritual truth with\nall beings is to not fully unders=\r\ntand the loving and compassionate\nnature of spiritual truth. We are each ca=\r\nlled upon to share the\nliberating truth of Dharma with all.&quot;\n\n- Sri Dharma =\r\nPravartaka Acharya\n\n\n\n_____________________________________________________=\r\n______\n\nAnnouncements:\n\n\n1) Dr. Morales to Speaks at the Dharma Summit in O=\r\nrlando\n\nDr. Morales will be a keynote speaker at the Dharma Summit conferen=\r\nce\nscheduled to take place December 14-16 in Orlando, Florida.\nOrganized un=\r\nder the guidance of Param Pujya Sri Swami Dayananda\nSwarasvati, the Dharma =\r\nSummit is by far the largest and most\nimportant Hindu conference in America=\r\n.
