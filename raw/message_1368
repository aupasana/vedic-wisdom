Ujjain is also famous for Raja Bharathat Hari &lt;BR&gt;&gt; cave.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; Raja Barathari is considered as one of the 9 Naths from the Nath &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Sampradaya. He meditated for a long time and then he went south &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Devas, a small town near Indore. The legend is, a drop o=\r\nf blood &lt;BR&gt;&gt; from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sati when Lord Shiva was\n carrying the =\r\ncorpse feel in Devas too. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; And &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in the same place on a=\r\n hill there is a Chamunda Devi Temple. A &lt;BR&gt;lot &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\ngreat Mahatmas since 1400 Have been staying and meditating &lt;BR&gt;there, &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; starting with Raja Barathari, then came the Poet Chand Bardai &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nand &lt;BR&gt;&gt; then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sheelnath Maharaj and Swami Shri VishnuTirth=\r\n Maharaj in the 20th &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; century. Over and above the temple now t=\r\nhere is Sheelnath &lt;BR&gt;maharaj &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dhuni Sanstan and also Swami Vi=\r\nshnuTirth Maharaj&#39;s Ashram &lt;BR&gt;located &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the valley=\r\n of the hill where Mother Chamunda temple is situated.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Mother in this temple manifested many times and gave guidance &lt;BR&gt;an=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; darshan to all of the above saints. I am sure there are oth=\r\ners &lt;BR&gt;who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; benefited too.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; They al=\r\nl stayed at the Temple in devas.
