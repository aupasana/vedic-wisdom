He had heard many sto=\r\nries of such misconduct on the part of Sanyasins from the Rishikesh public.=\r\n What struck him as unique was the fact that in Siva&#39;s Ashram almost all th=\r\ne Sanyasins were young and youthful.\n\n`Swamiji, pardon my presumption. But =\r\nwould it not have been better for these people to wait for some time more b=\r\nefore embracing this holy order which is so very difficult to stick to? Are=\r\n you sure that these young initiates have really understood the duties of t=\r\nhis Ashrama, and that they will adhere to the principles? I should think it=\r\n is a great mistake to initiate them so early.&#39;\n\nSiva laughed gently. `Why!=\r\n I myself can give you many examples of this type. One young man took Sanya=\r\ns. He was a great Vairagi. His exemplary life made his brother also to take=\r\n Sanyas. Later on, his (the former&#39;s) dispassion wanted. He married, ate eg=\r\ngs and meat. His brother, however, stuck to the line. The former did not li=\r\nve with his Guru: he had his own Manmukhi (whimsical) Sadhana. He did not p=\r\nrotect himself in seclusion by Satsang. Another young Sanyasi was fiery in =\r\nhis Sadhana. He inspired and elevated many Sadhaks. Later on he married and=\r\n has a child. How did this happen? He freely mixed with householders. He al=\r\nlowed ladies to shampoo his legs. He had a downfall, brought forth a child.=\r\n There are many such instances.&#39;\n\n`That is exactly what I mean, Swamiji. In=\r\n that case, is it not better not to give Sanyas to young people at all.&#39;\n\n`=\r\nMy dear Bhagatji, that is where you are mistaken. They might fall and rise =\r\nagain. Yet, they are worthy of your veneration. For, at least one day they =\r\nwere Sanyasins. They had the courage to throw up their hands and say: `I re=\r\nnounce the pleasures of the three worlds.&#39; How glorious is Sanyas. How glor=\r\nious is such renunciation of the pleasures of the three worlds.\n\n`They had =\r\nthe boldness and daring to stand up against the greatest forces of nature, =\r\nthe forces that maintain this Samsara=97those of self-preservation and proc=\r\nreation. They stand there as the masters of nature: you are mercilessly dri=\r\nven by these forces whose slave you are. Maybe: some renunciates do not pro=\r\nperly assess the strength of these opposing forces. They are sometimes take=\r\nn unawares, when they are a little heedless. But those who never renounce, =\r\nfor fear of having a downfall are cowardly, and they never know what it is =\r\nto renounce all. They never look at the battle-field lest their nose should=\r\n be injured. They jest at scars that never felt a wound. But a brave warrio=\r\nr wears these scars as ornaments, for those scars taught him to protect him=\r\nself in battle.\n\n`Churchills are required in Sanyas. Brave, courageous even=\r\n in the face of successive defeats, Sanyasins should learn lessons and pin =\r\ntheir faith in `ultimate victory&#39;. Sure, victory will be theirs if only the=\r\ny persist, persevere and plod on, without yielding midway. Let the light of=\r\n God shine brightly in the heart: protect that faith and tenacious adherenc=\r\ne to the Lotus Feet of the Lord. Storms of passions will sweep the external=\r\ns: and when God&#39;s grace descends on the Sadhaka, everything will be quiet a=\r\nnd tranquil. Glory, glory to Sanyas and Sadhana.\n\n`Sadhaks should learn a l=\r\nesson from these stories. They should be vigilant, cautious. There is no ne=\r\ned to lose heart. But, each such episode ought to re-awaken in the young Sa=\r\nnyasin a love for seclusion, for Satsang with his own Guru. Sadhaks should =\r\nnever drift away from their Guru. They should plunge themselves into Sadhan=\r\na and endeavour to realise God, every moment of their life.\n\n`A wise man pr=\r\nofits himself by others&#39; experience: a middling by his own: a fool by neith=\r\ner. The story of others&#39; downfall ought not to dishearten you. But, on the =\r\ncontrary, it should teach you a lesson. It should put you on your guard. An=\r\nd, you should uphold the glory of Sanyasa. Because one man has failed to li=\r\nve up to Sanyasa, you should not think that the Order itself is unsuitable =\r\nfor the youth.\n\n`What about the names of great Sanyasins like Swami Vivekan=\r\nanda, Swami Rama Tirtha, Swami Dayananda, Bhagavan Raman Maharshi. As a mat=\r\nter of fact, you find that most of the noteworthy Sanyasins renounced the w=\r\norld while yet they were youthful. What can an old man achieve? When the po=\r\nwer of hearing has gone, what Sravana is he going to do? No Sadhana will be=\r\n possible for the old man. It is mock-Sanyas if he embraces the Holy Order.=\r\n Sanyas would then become a formality. Further, conditions are such these d=\r\nays that an old man finds himself inextricably entangled in family life. Th=\r\nerefore, it is essential that young boys should renounce the world and embr=\r\nace Sanyas. They have fewer worldly ties.&#39;\n\n`It was because perfectly or im=\r\nperfectly man has striven to live, to exist, that we find today that he has=\r\n survived when countless other species have perished and gone. Similarly, i=\r\nt is because young men or old felt disgust for the worldly life and embrace=\r\nd Sanyas whether they have later been able to rise to eminence or have been=\r\n the victims of animal nature, that today that glorious Order has survived.=\r\n&#39;\n\n`Young Sanyasins should keep themselves ever busy in Japan, Kirtan, Swad=\r\nhyaya, meditation and Vichara: they should live in the company of their Gur=\r\nu and practise vigorous Sadhana. They should never enter the cities. Even i=\r\nf they have to pass through a city, they should as far as possible avoid th=\r\ne crowd. Seclusion is the key to successful Sanyas-life. I have always advi=\r\nsed my disciples never to enter the plains: and even if they have to do so =\r\nowing to the exigencies of selfless service, I ask them to finish their wor=\r\nk quickly and run back to their Himalayan abode. The Himalayas are the home=\r\ns of Sadhakas and Sanyasins. A Sanyasin is safe so long as he is there. San=\r\nyas was born in the Himalayas: Sanyas lives and will ever live in the Himal=\r\nayas alone.\n\n\n"}}
