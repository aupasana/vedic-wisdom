And I agree 200% with the statement that Jyana Yo=\r\nga needs one to be brutally honesty with our own selves. Which at various t=\r\nimes we are not, because the ego (sense of I-ness) loves to shield our own =\r\nvital flaws from ourselves to provide ever so slightly an illusion of wellb=\r\neing, progress and knowledge.\n\nHowever, I slightly disagree with the statem=\r\nent on RajaYoga. IMHO, any kind of concentrated effort at calming the mind =\r\ndown, in a controlled posture, is a part of Rajayoga. And pretty much every=\r\n seeker tries it to some extent. And it can work too depending on how much =\r\none is able to focus the mind. What we normally understand by the term medi=\r\ntation is part of RajaYoga.\n\n\nWhat Sri Ramakrishna *may* (it looks more rea=\r\nsonable to me) have referred, and advised against,was possibly HathaYoga. N=\r\now that is extremely dangerous=C2=A0 without the right environment, without=\r\n the right food, right habits, right control and most importantly the right=\r\n mentor/guide/guru.\n\nHatha Yoga forces the Kundalini to awaken using a guid=\r\ned combination of physical postures. This automatically presumes that the Y=\r\nogi must have a disease free body and a very stable mind. Mistakes here can=\r\n be extremely costly.\n\n\nAs such Swami Vivekananda was very adept in meditat=\r\nion practices. So that would technically fall under RajaYoga.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nThough I am not sure of the full context, yet could no=\r\nt resist the urge to make a small comment on a line from the emails below.\n=\r\n\n&lt;&lt;These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagavat Gita, you can check it, I assure th=\r\nere are four of them.&gt;&gt;\n\nMany great spiritual commentators, who are also fo=\r\nunders of various sects within hinduism have commented and written purports=\r\n on the Gita. And each of these celebrated commentators have strongly disag=\r\nreed with each other on various crucial points of interpretation of what th=\r\ne text says. Some have read it to conclude that &quot;X&quot; yoga is better or highe=\r\nr than &quot;Y&quot; yoga, or A philosophy is the right way to look at reality instea=\r\nd of Y philosophy, or interpreted words/phrases in a sense that,sometimes d=\r\noes not make sense. And naturally followers of each of these great Gurus be=\r\nlieve that their interpretation is the final and maximum one.\n\nReading all =\r\nthis can be confusing. Rather IMHO the Gita looks more like a book of progr=\r\nessive arguments. Each section builds up into the next. It is not one again=\r\nst the other, or one separate from the other. In that sense it is hardly a =\r\nsectarian document, it does not say one specific interpretation of the spir=\r\nitual reality is higher or better than another, but rather (probably becaus=\r\ne the reality is so complex)accepts that multiple views points are *simulta=\r\nneously* true.\n\n\n\nThough\nwe have classified our understanding of the spirit=\r\nual path today \ninto some broad exclusive basics like Jyana, Bhakti, Karma =\r\nETC ETC.. I am not sure if this is what the actual text intended to do.\n\nIs=\r\n it not interesting that every chapter of the Gita is a Yoga? Arjuna&#39;s depr=\r\nession is also named as Yoga - Arjunavishad Yoga. [So many people get depre=\r\nssed about so many things daily, yet what exactly is special about Arjuna&#39;s=\r\n depression, or what is that depression which when it afflicts someone make=\r\ns him/her=C2=A0 fit for receiving Divine knowledge?]\n\nTherefore, IMO, one d=\r\noes not really go into Gyana Yoga by bypassing or staying away from Karma Y=\r\noga. As Karma Yoga gets perfected, automatically a higher Gyana comes into =\r\nthe seeker.

The goal is to manifest this divin=\r\nity within by controlling\n nature: external and internal. Do this either by=\r\n work or worship or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or al=\r\nl of these - and be free.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nHere are my 2 cents.\n=C2=A0\nJnana yoga em=\r\nphasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and =\r\ndetachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti y=\r\noga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever =\r\nis natural to one and try to develop that quality. However, wisdom, detache=\r\nd action, self-control and surrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclus=\r\nive. As one of these qualities develops nicely in one, others will automati=\r\ncally develop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or onenes=\r\ns) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.\n=C2=A0\nForget about horos=\r\ncope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly=\r\n recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised\n=\r\n against it. Controlling body and mind and forcing the psychic life force t=\r\no purify and ascend requires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In thi=\r\ns age of polluted air, water and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of ob=\r\nstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but wh=\r\nat Ramakrishna explicitly taught in &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one of the gre=\r\natest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pur=\r\nsuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even hi=\r\nm to practice it.\n=C2=A0\nJnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct d=\r\nanger of falling into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this =\r\nage are not sincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that &quot;=\r\nall is Brahman. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t matter. I=\r\nt&#39;s all a delusion anyway&quot; without fully overcoming all innate conditioning=\r\n that reinforces duality in consciousness every instant. Kind\n of like decl=\r\naring wisely in a movie that &quot;it&#39;s just a movie and not reality&quot;, but flinc=\r\nhing in every scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute =\r\nhonesty, sincerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A lo=\r\nng path of constant contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a q=\r\nuick delusional jump to the end.\n=C2=A0\nIMHo, for most people in this age, =\r\nBhakti yoga and Karma yoga are the most suitable and safest.\n=C2=A0\nBest re=\r\ngards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org \n--------\n=C2=A0\n--- In sohamsa@yahoogroups.com, Vishnu J=\r\nandhyala &lt;jvishnu@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Ms. Maja,\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; Now diff=\r\nerent type of 4 yogas based on ayana/kendra:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dharma ayana - Gyana y=\r\noga- lagna and its trines\n&gt; &gt; Artha ayana - Karma yoga -\n 10th bhava and it=\r\ns trines\n&gt; &gt; Kama ayana - Raja yoga- 7th bhava and its trines\n&gt; &gt; Moksha ay=\r\nana - Bhakti yoga - 4th bhava and its trines\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; These 4 yogas are list=\r\ned in Bhagavat Gita, you can check it, I assure\n&gt; &gt; there are four of them.=\r\n Though it is very indicative you skipped Rajayoga (\n&gt; &gt; controlling own se=\r\nnses) on your list...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Anyway, for which ayana will native decide is=\r\n seen in Navamsha varga.

And each of these celebrated comm=\r\nentators have strongly disagreed with each other on various crucial points =\r\nof interpretation of what the text says. Some have read it to conclude that=\r\n &quot;X&quot; yoga is better or higher than &quot;Y&quot; yoga, or A philosophy is the right w=\r\nay to look at reality instead of Y philosophy, or\n interpreted words/phrase=\r\ns in a sense that,sometimes does not make sense. And naturally followers of=\r\n each of these great Gurus believe that their interpretation is the final a=\r\nnd maximum one.&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-fam=\r\nily: Courier New,courier,monaco,monospace,sans-serif; background-color: tra=\r\nnsparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0);=\r\n font-size: 16px; font-family: Courier New,courier,monaco,monospace,sans-se=\r\nrif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Reading all this c=\r\nan be confusing. Rather IMHO the Gita looks more like a book of progressive=\r\n arguments. Each section builds up into the next. It is not one against the=\r\n other, or one separate from the other. In that sense it is hardly a sectar=\r\nian document, it does not say one specific interpretation of the spiritual =\r\nreality is higher or better than another, but rather (probably because the =\r\nreality is so complex)accepts that multiple\n views points are *simultaneous=\r\nly* true.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 1=\r\n6px; font-family: Courier New,courier,monaco,monospace,sans-serif; backgrou=\r\nnd-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;Though\nwe have classified our u=\r\nnderstanding of the spiritual path today \ninto some broad exclusive basics =\r\nlike Jyana, Bhakti, Karma ETC ETC..

Arjuna&#39;s depres=\r\nsion is also named as Yoga - Arjunavishad Yoga. [So many people get depress=\r\ned about so many things daily, yet what exactly is special about Arjuna&#39;s d=\r\nepression, or what is that depression which when it afflicts someone makes =\r\nhim/her&nbsp; fit for receiving Divine knowledge?]&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;Therefore, =\r\nIMO, one does not really go into Gyana Yoga by bypassing or staying away fr=\r\nom Karma Yoga.

It is very much&lt;br&gt;&gt; possible and in fact is a measure of s=\r\nelf realized people.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Indeed, one can carve one&#39;s own niche by =\r\ncombining multiple paths. They are not meant to be mutually exclusive.&lt;br&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;I&#39;ll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; where he ma=\r\nkes a comment on the 4 paths:&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&quot;Each soul is potentially divine=\r\n. The goal is to manifest this divinity within by controlling\n nature: exte=\r\nrnal and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control, or=\r\n philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;Here are my 2 cents.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophizatio=\r\nn and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga empha=\r\nsizes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion =\r\nand surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try t=\r\no develop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and =\r\nsurrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualit=\r\nies develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally,=\r\n a realized person (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or oneness) will have all these qual=\r\nities fully blossomed.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsam=\r\nsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Ra=\r\nja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised\n against it. Controll=\r\ning body and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend r=\r\nequires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted air=\r\n, water and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja y=\r\noga can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna explic=\r\nitly taught in &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one of the greatest spiritual texts=\r\n IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He t=\r\naught it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of fallin=\r\ng into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not sin=\r\ncere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that &quot;all is Brahman.=\r\n I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s all a delus=\r\nion anyway&quot; without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforce=\r\ns duality in consciousness every instant. Kind\n of like declaring wisely in=\r\n a movie that &quot;it&#39;s just a movie and not reality&quot;, but flinching in every s=\r\ncary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, sincer=\r\nely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of cons=\r\ntant contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional=\r\n jump to the end.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yo=\r\nga and Karma yoga are the most suitable and safest.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regar=\r\nds,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a =\r\nrel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;=\r\n&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;--- In sohams=\r\na@yahoogroups.com, Vishnu Jandhyala &lt;jvishnu@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; Dear Ms. Maja,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaste&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Now different =\r\ntype of 4 yogas based on ayana/kendra:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Dharma aya=\r\nna - Gyana yoga- lagna and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt; Artha ayana - Karma yog=\r\na -\n 10th bhava and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Kama ayana - Raja yoga- 7th bha=\r\nva and its trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Moksha ayana - Bhakti yoga - 4th bhava and i=\r\nts trines&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagavat Gi=\r\nta, you can check it, I assure&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; there are four of them.
