The lowest level is vaikhari. This is the sound at the physical lev=\r\nel. When you say something by moving the physical body parts (lips etc), th=\r\neir movement vibrates the air particles and those vibrations vibrate the ph=\r\nysical body parts in the ears of listeners and people around you can &quot;liste=\r\nn&quot;.\n \nAt the same time, the subtle thoughts in the mind accompanying the ch=\r\nanting of the mantra result in movement in parts of your &quot;subtle body&quot;, whi=\r\nch vibrate the subtle space around you and those cause some vibrations in t=\r\nhe subtle bodies of people around you.\n \nIn this way, sound (or vibration) =\r\nis produced at 4 levels. The subtler the level, the longer the signal can c=\r\narry without decaying.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf one has some shakti accum=\r\nulated with a specific mantra, one&#39;s chanting of that mantra is infused wit=\r\nh that shakti.\n \nThe energy infused when one chants a mantra is carried mai=\r\nnly in the subtler levels of sound. The energy carried at the physical leve=\r\nl (vaikhari) of sound is very small compared to the energy carried in the s=\r\nubtler levels. However, the vaikhari level sound contains the key to the su=\r\nbtler levels for most people.\n \nI can explain this using an analogy. One ma=\r\ny have a powerful concept or idea in mind that one is thinking of. Most oth=\r\ner people cannot read one&#39;s mind and cannot access that concept or idea. Ho=\r\nwever, if one expresses the idea in words, people will be able to access th=\r\nat idea. Most of the power is in the idea and not in the exact words used. =\r\nHowever, the written/spoken words that are tangible to others act as a key =\r\nto one&#39;s thoughts. World can now access the power of one&#39;s idea!\n \nSimilarl=\r\ny, the exact letters or words of a mantra are not really alive with energy.=\r\n But, when one does sadhana with the mantra, one&#39;s chanting of the mantra i=\r\ns infused with some power. Other people cannot access that power normally. =\r\nBut, once one says the mantra in an audible form (just like expressing the =\r\nidea in tangible words above), the power in one&#39;s chanting of the mantra is=\r\n accessible to those who hear it. Even though the power is not really in th=\r\ne audible sound produced, the audible sound acts as a key to the inaudible =\r\nsound and world can now access the power of one&#39;s chanting (just as the wri=\r\ntten words act as a key to one&#39;s idea and the world can now access the powe=\r\nr of one&#39;s idea).\n \nWhen you chant a mantra silently, you are hiding your s=\r\nhakti with the mantra from the world. When you chant a mantra loud, you are=\r\n sharing your shakti with the mantra with the world. Some of it can be wast=\r\ned and some of it can be tapped by someone.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIf leav=\r\nes, flowers and fruits are plucked from a small plant, it will not grow and=\r\n it will die. Similarly, one&#39;s shakti with a mantra will not grow if one ke=\r\neps saying that mantra loud now and then. As one keeps chanting a mantra si=\r\nlently, while maintaining some yama and niyama, one will slowly accumulate =\r\nshakti with it.\n \nIf you do not intend to accumulate shakti with any mantra=\r\n, that is fine too. That is NOT an impediment to self-purification and self=\r\n-realization. However, certain tasks in this dual world require an accumula=\r\ntion of enough shakti with a mantra. If one&#39;s guru wants one to do somethin=\r\ng in future and asks one to accumulate shakti with a specific mantra, one h=\r\nas to do it.\n \n*        *        *\n \nManish&#39;s guru was a realized man. His =\r\nname was Nakhate Maharaj. He was a Bhadra Kaali worshipper. He was blessed =\r\nby a darshan of Bhadra Kaali and went into nirvikalpa samadhi at the age of=\r\n 21 years. He remained in nirvikalpa samadhi for 7 days and returned to the=\r\n dual world to perform the tasks assigned to him, as a detached actor.\n \nEv=\r\nen a realized man like him did not utter some mantras audibly. For example,=\r\n when he gave a specific mantra to Manish, the means he employed were quite=\r\n old-fashioned. He did not say the mantra in Manish&#39;s ear. Instead, he aske=\r\nd Manish to sit down with closed eyes and placed his thumbs on Manish&#39;s tem=\r\nples. He asked Manish to focus and then he also focused. Manish saw a mantr=\r\na in Devanagari script in letters made of fire. He remembered what he saw a=\r\nnd did sadhana with that mantra.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThese methods are =\r\nused for a purpose and not out of selfishness. There are two main reasons:\n=\r\n \n(1) You want to keep the shakti you accumulated with that mantra, because=\r\n there is a purpose for it. Giving is great, but giving indiscriminately is=\r\n unwise. When one can do finite tasks, one has to optimize what one does.\n(=\r\n2) Nothing that comes too easy lasts. If one gets a million bucks easily, o=\r\nne can waste it. Instead of giving million dollars to someone, it will be b=\r\netter if you teach one how to work hard and make money.\n \nSharing various t=\r\nhoughts and spiritual truths and inspiring people to do sadhana is one thin=\r\ng and sharing one&#39;s accumulated shakti with a mantra with people another.\n =\r\n\n*        *        *\n \nAs I mentioned Nakhate Maharaj, I want to mention a =\r\nsmall story about him.\n \nWhen Nakhate Maharaj left this world, his sishyas =\r\nhad an interesting experience. Manish was in UK meditating at that time. He=\r\n suddenly felt that his guru was in front of him. He opened his eyes and sa=\r\nw that Nakhate Maharaj was standing in front of him physically. He held his=\r\n palm up in the blessing pose. Then he waved his hand as if saying good bye=\r\n. Then he disappeared. When Manish called India later, he found out that Na=\r\nkhate Maharaj left his body at the same time in India. He also found out th=\r\nat his other sishyas too had the same experience in different parts of the =\r\nworld around the same time.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedi=\r\nc-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFre=\r\ne Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath =\r\nCentre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------------- \n\n  ----- Original Message ----- =\r\n\n  From: Jyotisa Shisya \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n  Sent: Sunday=\r\n, June 07, 2009 10:45 AM\n  Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Help me Regardin=\r\ng SAVITRU GAAYATHRI MANTHRAM\n\n  |om|\n  Dear Narasimha, namaste & pranaams\n =\r\n  \n  Please forgive me if I am seen to be impertinent in my question based =\r\non the lines in bold below.\n   \n  Why must the Guru upadesa be kept secret =\r\nand not shared with anyone who might benefit? More the so if it is a prasid=\r\ndha mantra? Think of Ramanujacharya, who after receiving the astakshari fro=\r\nm his Guru, shouted the mantra from the rooftop to all and thus the world w=\r\nas benefited.

I can record other mantras in =\r\nmy voice and share with all, but instructed to not give Savitur Gayatri man=\r\ntra in my voice to anyone. It is my spiritual food. Most of my spiritual ex=\r\nperiences came with this mantra and I need this mantra for more things in f=\r\nuture. So I keep it to myself and do not share it with all.\n\n  But many peo=\r\nple in your city should be able to teach you this mantra with correct pronu=\r\nnciation. By the way, I think you live in Chennai. If so, please try to mee=\r\nt Swami Sathasivom at Kalikambal temple on Thambuchetty Street near Central=\r\n station. He belongs to a rare class of priests who are fast becoming extin=\r\nct in this commercial age. If possible, meet him and take his blessings.\n\n =\r\n My intuition tells me that you are a man made for karma yoga rather than m=\r\neditation and veda mantras. Surrender to your chosen deity, see that deity =\r\nin all people and serve people around you. See god in all people. If possib=\r\nle, think of starting a small movement in the slums of Chennai (or wherever=\r\n you live). Go, serve people there, help them to the best of your ability a=\r\nnd teach them about god. After helping them materially first, then teach th=\r\nem to chant god&#39;s name when they have a few minutes of time. In my opinion,=\r\n this is the right path for you.\n\n  Actions performed with ego, pride and a=\r\nttachment bind one. Actions without ego, pride and attachment liberate one.=\r\n Please perform big acts of social service and yet without any pride or att=\r\nachment. Do not be upset with a few failures in the beginning (upset comes =\r\nwith attachment. A detached person is not upset if his sincere actions do n=\r\not give the intended result) and keep trying calmly. Sincere and detached a=\r\nction never fails in the long run. Start slowly.\n\n  Best regards,\n  Narasim=\r\nha\r\n------=_NextPart_000_047C_01C9E790.26353D60\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;UTF-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n=EF=BB=BF&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HT=\r\nML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Du=\r\ntf-8&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;.ygrp-photo-title {\n\tCLEAR: both; FONT-SIZE: =\r\nsmaller; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 75px; HEIGHT: 15px; TEXT-ALIGN: center\n}\n=\r\nDIV.ygrp-photo {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-POSITION: cente=\r\nr 50%; BORDER-TOP: black 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: black 1px solid; WIDTH: 62=\r\npx; BORDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-REPEAT: no-repeat; HEIGHT: 6=\r\n2px; BACKGROUND-COLOR: white\n}\nDIV.photo-title A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}=\r\n\nDIV.photo-title A:active {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:hove=\r\nr {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:visited {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: =\r\nnone\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row {\n\tCLEAR: both\n}\nDIV.attach-table DI=\r\nV.attach-row DIV {\n\tFLOAT: left\n}\nP {\n\tCLEAR: both; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PAD=\r\nDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 3px; OVERFLOW: hidden; PADDING-TOP: 15px\n}\n=\r\nDIV.ygrp-file {\n\tWIDTH: 30px; valign: middle\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-=\r\nrow DIV DIV A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row DI=\r\nV DIV SPAN {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: normal\n}\nDIV.ygrp-file-title {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bol=\r\nd\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp{\n  border: 1px solid #=\r\nd8d8d8;\n  font-family: Arial;\n  margin: 14px 0px;\n  padding: 0px 14px;\n}\n#y=\r\ngrp-mkp hr{\n  border: 1px solid #d8d8d8;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd{\n  color: #628c2a;=\r\n\n  font-size: 85%;\n  font-weight: bold;\n  line-height: 122%;\n  margin: 10px=\r\n 0px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads{\n  margin-bottom: 10px;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad{\n  padding: =\r\n0 0;\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a{\n  color: #0000ff;\n  text-decoration: none;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/=\r\nSTYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3527&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;B=\r\nODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Dear Hari,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Never hesitate to ask or say anything that may seem \nimpe=\r\nrtinent.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fa=\r\nce=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Wh=\r\nen a mantra is spoken, sound is produced at 4 \nlevels.
