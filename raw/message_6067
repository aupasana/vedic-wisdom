Please spare some time to answer. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) Can we give aahutis to Maharishi Parashara while doing homam f=\r\nor Shri Krishna? If yes, please give mantra to be used and how and when dur=\r\ning homam we can do this\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) Recently it dawned to me that we shoul=\r\nd thank to navagraha deities for all the work they have been doing for us a=\r\nnd we should thank them for showing all us the path in their own way. Can w=\r\ne do this through homam? If yes please give a manual for Navagraha homam. O=\r\nr better if we can use Kuja/shani homam as a basic and make some changes in=\r\n them. In this case, please tell the changes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Or can we give ahuti=\r\ns to Navagraha while doing Krishna homam? if yes please give mantras to be =\r\nused and how and when we can do this\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I shall be thankful to you\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
