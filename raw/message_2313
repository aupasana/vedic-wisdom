But, are they really one&#39;s own words and one&#39;s own ideas? On=\r\ne expresses what one has realized based on reading various masters, discuss=\r\ning with one&#39;s guru(s), meditating, contemplating and eventually digesting =\r\nthat knowledge.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thus, I see nothing wrong in quoting a great saint or=\r\n a yogi, as opposed to writing one&#39;s own thoughts.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I started this lis=\r\nt to share my thoughts on various spiritual matters. Based on my own experi=\r\nences, I could finally make sense of various seemingly contradictory things=\r\n I had read. I could put it all together in my mind and have a uniform, con=\r\nsistent, coherent and integrated understanding that put various things in t=\r\nhe correct perspective. I wanted to promote such a wholesome and integrated=\r\n understanding and do my part in &quot;bridging&quot; various &quot;islands&quot; of spiritual =\r\nwisdom that exist out there. The other goal of this forum is to remove some=\r\n fundamental confusions and misunderstandings that may be blocking some peo=\r\nple from doing spiritual sadhana and making spiritual progress and encourag=\r\ne some people to do spiritual sadhana.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If words of a great yogi or sa=\r\nint that promote the same goal are shared, I see nothing wrong in it. The o=\r\nnly thing is I request people to go a bit slow and not post too many such m=\r\nails on the same day. Some people may be overwhelmed by the traffic and jus=\r\nt delete the mails. One can slowly cover the ground one wants to cover, ove=\r\nr a period of time.
