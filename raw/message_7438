This is applicable to Vedic mantras as \n&gt; =\r\nwell.\n&gt; \n&gt; For example, Savitru Gayatri mantra from RigVeda 3rd mandala is =\r\na Vedic \n&gt; mantra and is available in books with the intonation. Yet, we do=\r\n not \n&gt; tell a new sadhaka to get it from books. When we do Upanayanam, fat=\r\nher \n&gt; (or a capable guru) initiates a young person into the Gayatri mantra=\r\n! \n&gt; Initiation is relevant for Vedic mantras too.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; When initiated by a good sadhaka, you basically start off with a \n&gt; p=\r\nositive balance (instead of zero), which makes it easier (faster) to \n&gt; ach=\r\nieve a good level with the mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, just as it is possible to =\r\nstart a bank account with zero \n&gt; balance and yet accumulate a million doll=\r\nars with one&#39;s own effort, it \n&gt; is possible to achieve a high level with a=\r\n mantra despite not being \n&gt; initiated and learning from a book. Similarly,=\r\n just as a useless fellow \n&gt; who started a bank balance with $100k gifted b=\r\ny a rich uncle may blow it \n&gt; in no time, so may a bad sadhaka not get anyw=\r\nhere despite being \n&gt; initiated by a good guru.\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline: Initiation=\r\n is useful, but it is not as big a deal as most \n&gt; people today believe. Ef=\r\nfort is important. Do japam/homam with your \n&gt; chosen mantra for as many ho=\r\nurs as you can do everyday.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly, there a=\r\nren&#39;t too many gurus around who actually have some \n&gt; shakti with a mantra =\r\nand capable of (and willing to!) transfer it to \n&gt; you. Most initiations to=\r\nday are a meaningless formality and merely an \n&gt; exercise in *ego gratifica=\r\ntion* on both ends (initiator and initiated)!\n&gt; \n&gt; Getting a token check fo=\r\nr million dollars with &quot;void&quot; written across it \n&gt; from an uncle to start y=\r\nour bank balance will not make you rich. You \n&gt; will still have zero dollar=\r\ns in your account as that check is not valid. \n&gt; Gifting the void check to =\r\nyou was merely a photo opportunity. Similarly, \n&gt; most initiations and most=\r\n blessings by elders now-a-days are either \n&gt; voided checks or checks that =\r\nwill bounce. They are just photo ops.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sorry to be blunt, but cut =\r\nthe chase and get down to what really \n&gt; matters - your OWN sadhana. Stop h=\r\nunting for a guru or a sadhaka who can \n&gt; initiate you. Times are changing =\r\nand it is not likely to be a fruitful \n&gt; exercise. Pick a mantra and just d=\r\no sadhana with it.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; A lot of mantras that used=\r\n to be extremely secretive in ancient times \n&gt; and given only orally in the=\r\n ear by a guru are out in the open now. This \n&gt; includes Vedic mantras such=\r\n as Lakshmi Narayana Hridayam from Atharva \n&gt; Rahasyam as well as Tantric m=\r\nantras such as many Mahavidya mantras.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is Nature&#39;s way of arrangi=\r\nng for the progress of prepared souls \n&gt; that may occasionally take birth h=\r\nere in the coming times. Times that \n&gt; are coming will be different from th=\r\ne times gone by. Rules and \n&gt; conventions will also be different.\n&gt; \n&gt; *   =\r\n     *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; For some thoughts on Vedic mantras/rituals vs Tantrik =\r\nmantras/rituals, \n&gt; please see the link below:\n&gt; \n&gt; Analogy: Veda, Aagama, =\r\nTantra, Aghora etc\n&gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/361=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Veda is like theoretical Science and Tantra is like applied Technolog=\r\ny. \n&gt; Though people draw a distinction, the two are actually quite \n&gt; inter=\r\ntwined. One who argues about the superiority of one vs the other or \n&gt; look=\r\ns at them as being totally different understands neither.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kali yuga is=\r\n the age of needless compartmentalization of knowledge and \n&gt; increase of i=\r\ngnorance due to too much compartmentalization and \n&gt; incompleteness in know=\r\nledge.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish L=\r\nessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam=\r\n and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;  =\r\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirit=\r\nuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitte=\r\nr ID: @homam108\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------\n\n\n\n"}}
