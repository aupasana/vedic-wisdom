I have already implemented s=\r\nome of the recommendations you made, most importantly the mantra &quot;Gananam T=\r\nva Ganapatim HAVAMAHE&quot; from your jyotish lectures back in 2004/2005! \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; In the recent times I was pondering about h=\r\now north Indians speak Hindi, where they reduce most of the words to &quot;Halan=\r\nthas&quot;, like &quot;Shiv&quot;, &quot;Ram&quot;, &quot;Krishn&quot; and so on. It is indeed one of the corn=\r\nerstones of Sanskrit that a consonant cannot exist by itself and its life i=\r\ns given by the Vowel. But for whatever reason in Hindi they mostly avoid en=\r\nding vowels. They carry that habit to other languages as well and recently =\r\nI heard one of the North Indian bhajan singers (I don&#39;t know the name) sing=\r\ning Adi Sankara&#39;s Bhaja Govindam as &quot;Bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, bhaj gov=\r\nindam, moodh matE&quot;, which sounded quite odd to me! And they take that appro=\r\nach to languages like Braj Bhasha and Avadhi as well. For instance, for the=\r\nm &quot;Ramacharita Manasa&quot; is more important than even Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet =\r\nthey pronounce Avadhi also without proper vowel endings. However, I have a =\r\nstrong feeling that, that approach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like =\r\n&quot;Sri Gurucharana\n Saroja\n&gt; &gt; raja&quot; should be pronounced exactly like that a=\r\nnd not like &quot;Sri Gurucharan saroj raj&quot;.

It is the nature of Kali yuga to corrupt ever=\r\nything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is my feeling that many people, including highly le=\r\narned Vedic scholars, pronounce some sounds in Sanskrit mantras (including =\r\nVeda mantras) incorrectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, pronunciation is not eve=\r\nrything. Having devotion and the spirit of surrender to god is even more im=\r\nportant. However, pronunciation is a factor too. Especially, correct pronun=\r\nciation is very important in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda ma=\r\nntra can stop one from the most complete experience of the mantra. In fact,=\r\n we have a lot of people who can memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very=\r\n few who can actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Over the next few=\r\n months, I will write my views on correct pronunciation and point out some =\r\ncommon errors. If you do not think that correct pronunciation is important =\r\nor if you disagree with my assessment of the errors or if you do not want t=\r\no change your pronunciation, please ignore my writings on this subject. On =\r\nthe other hand, if you are open to changing your pronunciation, please give=\r\n a consideration to my views and adopt my suggestions if you find them appr=\r\nopriate.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Take the &quot;t&quot; sound at the end of t=\r\nhe words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Most prie=\r\nsts and scholars pronounce this sound incorrectly. They change &quot;t&quot; to somet=\r\nhing like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is a reason why this corrup=\r\ntion came into practice, but it is a corruption nevertheless.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nIn &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/akshara. If you =\r\nchange it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowel sound at the end, it b=\r\necomes two aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas, changes the chh=\r\nandas and changes the meaning also. You may still experience something when=\r\n meditating on the mantra, but you will never experience the mantra to the =\r\nfullest with that pronunciation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Akshara means &quot;unperished&quot;. V=\r\nowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an akshara. If you have just =\r\na consonant without a vowel after it, then it has no praana. It is kshara a=\r\nnd NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (wi=\r\nthout adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound and the listen=\r\ner cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no life force.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Because &quot;=\r\nt&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which has=\r\n the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and becomes part of that akshara. In chhanda=\r\ns, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one letter (one guru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; co=\r\nrrectly, it is difficult for the listener to know for sure whether you said=\r\n &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one listens carefully, but o=\r\ntherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick and abrupt transient=\r\n sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; This makes=\r\n people add some vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or some other v=\r\nowel sound in between them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a praana and becomes=\r\n clearly audible. It suddenly becomes an akshara and the chhandas changes.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Probably, some big teacher started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaat=\r\nu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itself and becomes very clear to hear, so t=\r\nhat his students would not get confused when learning. Probably the student=\r\ns thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used to that m=\r\nis-pronunciation. Probably, that became a standard practice after a couple =\r\nof centuries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; If you pronounce the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do=\r\n not change it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a conson=\r\nant and leave it there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be added at the e=\r\nnd. The same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; What I said about words ending in consonants applies to all conson=\r\nants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly encountered. There can b=\r\ne words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also, people normally add an=\r\n artificial vowel sound at the end and end up changing the chhandas and alt=\r\nering the flow of energy in the mantra. That is also wrong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * =\r\n* *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; One more common mistake is the sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot;=\r\n =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce this as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D =\r\nmoney). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha looks ver=\r\ny similar and just one dot in the middle is different. It is possible that =\r\nsome people started mispronouncing this sound because of their inability to=\r\n see the dot and others started following. Now pronouncing tha as dha becam=\r\ne mainstream and one pronouncing correctly will be the odd person out.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is not English. We never have two different symbols for t=\r\nhe same sound or two different sounds for the same symbol. The letters &quot;tha=\r\n&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different and their sounds are different too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot;=\r\n (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a stress/aspiration to=\r\n get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the sankalpa before m=\r\nany poojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha chaturvidha purushaartha s=\r\niddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for attaining the purusharthas (purposes of human=\r\n existence) - dharma (fulfilling duties), artha (work and money), kaama (fu=\r\nlfilling desires) and moksha (developing detachment)&quot;. Most people end up p=\r\nronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It mea=\r\nns &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attai=\r\nnment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in this s=\r\nankalpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it committed by many many trained =\r\npriests!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pa=\r\ny attention to the difference between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounc=\r\ne them differently. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay extra at=\r\ntention to ensure that you are not confusing tha for dha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; * * =\r\n*\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are several other mistakes (in my view) commonly made =\r\nby most people in the pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I will be pointing=\r\n them out slowly in the next few months, whenever the Mother allows me to.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Please give me your consideration and take my input into consi=\r\nderation in altering your pronunciation (if you are open to that). If you d=\r\non&#39;t find any sense in what I am saying or want to continue as taught by yo=\r\nur gurus, I can understand that. I am not here to change everybody&#39;s pronun=\r\nciation. But, because She inspired me to share my thoughts with the world, =\r\nI am guessing that there are SOME who are destined to change their pronunci=\r\nation based on my views.

I have already implemente=\r\nd some of the recommendations you made, most importantly the mantra &quot;Ganana=\r\nm Tva Ganapatim HAVAMAHE&quot; from your jyotish\n lectures back in 2004/2005! &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In the recent times I =\r\nwas pondering about how north Indians speak Hindi, where they reduce most o=\r\nf the words to &quot;Halanthas&quot;, like &quot;Shiv&quot;, &quot;Ram&quot;, &quot;Krishn&quot; and so on. It is i=\r\nndeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskrit that a consonant cannot exist by =\r\nitself and its life is given by the Vowel. But for whatever reason in Hindi=\r\n they mostly avoid ending vowels. They carry that habit to other languages =\r\nas well and recently I heard one of the North Indian bhajan singers (I don&#39;=\r\nt know the name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bhaja Govindam as &quot;Bhaj govindam, bh=\r\naj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, which sounded quite odd to me! And=\r\n they take that approach to languages like Braj Bhasha and Avadhi as well. =\r\nFor instance, for them &quot;Ramacharita Manasa&quot; is more important than even Val=\r\nmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also without proper vowel ending=\r\ns. However, I have a strong feeling that, that\n approach is incorrect. In a=\r\nvadhi, a chowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana Saroja&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; raja&quot; should be =\r\npronounced exactly like that and not like &quot;Sri Gurucharan saroj raj&quot;. You m=\r\nay shed more light on this aspect as well. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Nagraj &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/7/11, aswinefy200=\r\n3 &lt;aswinefy2003@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Fro=\r\nm: aswinefy2003 &lt;aswinefy2003@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nRe: Common Sanskrit Pronunciation Errors (Part 1)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://us.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogrou=\r\nps.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yah=\r\noogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday,=\r\n April 7, 2011, 11:34 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=\r\n=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;&quot;If you do not like this discussion, I am sorry and just ign=\r\nore\n this idiot!&quot;&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear narasimha guruji &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; you are doing a great job to this universe by sharing =\r\nyour knwledge&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and correcting,but you are tooooo humble!!!.Trut=\r\nh ia truth and what ever you are saying is also truth .no need to consider =\r\nyourself as an idiot&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us=\r\n.mc819.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.co=\r\nm&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

It is the nature of Kali yuga to corrupt everything.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; It is my feeling that many people, incl=\r\nuding highly learned Vedic scholars, pronounce some sounds in Sanskrit mant=\r\nras\n (including Veda mantras) incorrectly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Of course, pronunciation is not everything. Having devotion and the sp=\r\nirit of surrender to god is even more important. However, pronunciation is =\r\na factor too. Especially, correct pronunciation is very important in Veda m=\r\nantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mantra can stop one from the most com=\r\nplete experience of the mantra. In fact, we have a lot of people who can me=\r\nmorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very few who can actually &quot;experience&quot; =\r\na mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Over the next few months, I =\r\nwill write my views on correct pronunciation and point out some common erro=\r\nrs. If you do not think that correct pronunciation is important or if you d=\r\nisagree with my assessment of the errors or if you do not want to change yo=\r\nur pronunciation, please ignore my writings on this subject. On the other h=\r\nand, if you are open to changing your pronunciation, please give a\n conside=\r\nration to my views and adopt my suggestions if you find them appropriate.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; Take the &quot;t&quot; sound at the end of the words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava pu=\r\nrastaat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound=\r\n incorrectly. They change &quot;t&quot; to something like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;t=\r\nti&quot;. There is a reason why this corruption came into practice, but it is a =\r\ncorruption nevertheless.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachoday=\r\naat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/akshara. If you change it int=\r\no &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowel sound at the end, it becomes two ak=\r\nsharas. This increases the number of aksharas, changes the chhandas and cha=\r\nnges the meaning also. You may still experience something when meditating o=\r\nn the mantra, but you will never experience the mantra to the fullest with =\r\nthat pronunciation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n Akshara means &quot;un=\r\nperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an akshara. If yo=\r\nu have just a consonant without a vowel after it, then it has no praana. It=\r\n is kshara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you pronounce &quot;=\r\nt&quot; as is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound an=\r\nd the listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no life =\r\nforce.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole so=\r\nund &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Because &quot;t&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply j=\r\noins to the akshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and beco=\r\nmes part of that akshara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one letter (one=\r\n guru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is difficult for the listen=\r\ner to know for sure whether you said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is poss=\r\nible if one listens carefully, but otherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end =\r\nis a very quick and abrupt transient sound without\n praana. So it tough to =\r\nhear clearly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This makes people add so=\r\nme vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or &quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in =\r\nbetween them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets a praana and becomes clearly audib=\r\nle. It suddenly becomes an akshara and the chhandas changes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Probably, some big teacher started pronouncing &quot;yaat=\r\n&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itself and becomes very clear to =\r\nhear, so that his students would not get confused when learning. Probably t=\r\nhe students thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used=\r\n to that mis-pronunciation. Probably, that became a standard practice after=\r\n a couple of centuries.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; If you pronoun=\r\nce the English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not change it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th=\r\n&quot; at the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant and leave it there. You don&#39;t force a=\r\nn vowel sound to be added at the end. The\n same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;pra=\r\nchodayaat&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; What I said about words ending in consonants applies to al=\r\nl consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly encountered. The=\r\nre can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also, people normall=\r\ny add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end up changing the chhandas=\r\n and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. That is also wrong.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; On=\r\ne more common mistake is the sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Most s=\r\nouth Indians pronounce this as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telugu a=\r\nnd Kannada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha looks very similar and just =\r\none dot in the middle is different. It is possible that some people started=\r\n mispronouncing this sound because of their inability to see the dot and ot=\r\nhers started following. Now pronouncing\n tha as dha became mainstream and o=\r\nne pronouncing correctly will be the odd person out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is not English. We never have two different symbols=\r\n for the same sound or two different sounds for the same symbol. The letter=\r\ns &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different and their sounds are different too. Pronoun=\r\nce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a stress/aspirat=\r\nion to get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; In the sankalpa before many poojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha kaama mok=\r\nsha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for attaining the p=\r\nurusharthas (purposes of human existence) - dharma (fulfilling duties), art=\r\nha (work and money), kaama (fulfilling desires) and moksha (developing deta=\r\nchment)&quot;. Most people end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;dha=\r\nrmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;. Even &quot;=\r\nsiddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot;\n and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a huma=\r\nn&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it =\r\ncommitted by many many trained priests!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; When you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to the d=\r\nifference between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them differently. =\r\nWhen you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay extra attention to ensure th=\r\nat you are not confusing tha for dha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n* * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; There are several other mistakes=\r\n (in my view) commonly made by most people in the pronunciation of Sanskrit=\r\n mantras. I will be pointing them out slowly in the next few months, whenev=\r\ner the Mother allows me to.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Please giv=\r\ne me your consideration and take my input into consideration in altering yo=\r\nur pronunciation (if you are open to that). If you don&#39;t find any sense in =\r\nwhat I am saying or want to\n continue as taught by your gurus, I can unders=\r\ntand that. I am not here to change everybody&#39;s pronunciation. But, because =\r\nShe inspired me to share my thoughts with the world, I am guessing that the=\r\nre are SOME who are destined to change their pronunciation based on my view=\r\ns.
