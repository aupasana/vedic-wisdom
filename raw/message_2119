It has b=\r\neen observed that if you place coconut pieces where white portion remains u=\r\np (pieces rest on dark side) then there are all the chances that pieces may=\r\n not burnt fully. this is my personal experience. so i can suggest few thin=\r\ngs as under:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; - Keep Dark side up\n&gt; &gt; - Keep the pieces such that t=\r\nhey don&#39;t pile on each other.\n&gt; &gt; - Keep the pieces such a way that it form=\r\ns a pyramid shape (top of that shape is opened so that Aahuti can be offere=\r\nd conveniently in that. i mean, there should be a scope for air to pass und=\r\ner the pieces.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is my experience that coconut peices do get burn=\r\nt completely.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;naaraayana_iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)While doing homam can we move the coconut=\r\n pieces that are there in the havan kund, so that they get burned easily.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; i asked it becoz would it be right to poke in the fire with a stick =\r\nwhile we are actually assuming Ganpati is in that fire and the idol at that=\r\n time.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yes.
