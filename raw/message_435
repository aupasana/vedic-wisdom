My personal view is that if the \n&gt; seers had re=\r\nally indulged in such a non-sense (actually the most \n&gt; cunning!) fad, almo=\r\nst all of them would still have been looking \nfor \n&gt; a spouse whose Patri w=\r\nould match with theirs with at least 28 \ngunas!\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;It is high time that =\r\nwe gave up the ancient Greek notion of \n&gt; astrology and get back to proper =\r\nastronomy.&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; This &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; has had such a deleterious affect o=\r\nn the \nreal \n&gt; Vedic culture that the words of the Gita are becoming most \n=\r\n&gt; meaningful these days:\n&gt; &quot;adharmam dharmam it ya manyate tamsa vrita\n&gt; sa=\r\nrvarthan vipareetanshchai, budhih saa partha tamasi&quot;\n&gt; i.e.\n&gt; &quot;an intellect=\r\n that views adharma as dharma (and dharma as adharma)\n&gt; besides viewing all=\r\n the things upside down, is the real Tamasic \n&gt; intellect&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; I find tha=\r\nt almost every Hindu is trying to defend &quot;Vedic \nastrology&quot; \n&gt; in spite of =\r\nthe fact that it has been made clear to them by now \nthat \n&gt; it is because =\r\nof that very fad that we are celebrating all our \n&gt; festivals and muhurtas =\r\non worng days, but their arguments are \nreally \n&gt; tamasic---like &quot;I do not =\r\nknow much about astronomy (and by \n&gt; implication it means that he/she knows=\r\n everything about astrology \n&gt; though!)&quot; is the stock reply of most of them=\r\n.  \n&gt; \n&gt; All the Hindus are now a days least bothered about celebrating \nPi=\r\ntra-\n&gt; Amavasya on the day of actual Dipavali which is on September 28, \n&gt; =\r\n2008, but they do not want to hear even a single word \nagainst &quot;Vedic \n&gt; as=\r\ntrology&quot;!  They celebrated marriages in actual Pitrapaksha \n&gt; because &quot;Vedi=\r\nc astrologes&quot; had okayed those dates!  \n&gt; \n&gt; What is surprising is that in =\r\nspite of being well read, most of \nthe \n&gt; Hindus have lost all sense of bas=\r\nic Primary school level geography!\n&gt; They have become oblivious of the fact=\r\n that Uttarayana cannot take \n&gt; place on any other day than the shortest da=\r\ny of the year or \n&gt; Dakshinayana except on the longest day of the year!  Bu=\r\nt they have \n&gt; put wool into their ears for such phenomena since &quot;Vedic \n&gt; =\r\nastrologers&quot; want them to celebrate Uttarayana on January 15 and \n&gt; Dakshin=\r\nayana on July 15 and so on!\n&gt; \n&gt; In short, most of the Hindu society appear=\r\ns to have become clones \nof \n&gt; Maya the mlechha just because of their fatal=\r\n infatuation \nwith &quot;Vedic \n&gt; astrology&quot;!
