The same talk appeared later as an article in the souvenir of the\nseminar on &quot;Vedic astronomy & Cosmology&quot;-December 2006. I am sure you will\nfind it interesting.\n\n\nRegards,\n\n\nA K Kaul\n\n\n                                    \n\n\nOm tat sat  brahmarpanamastu!\n\n\nOm Brahmanandam Parama sukhadam kevalam gyan moortim, dwandvateetam gagana\nsadrisham tat-tvam asyadi lakshyam                                  ekam\nnityam vimalam achalamsarva dhee sakshi bhootam, bhavateetam triguna rahitam\nshree gurum tam namami \n\n\n&quot;Vedic Astrology&quot; - the greatest fraud on the Vedas!\n\n\nDear friends. Good evening to everybody!\n\nI feel highly honoured to have been invited by Shri Ajay Bhasin for sharing\nmy views about astrology and related topics with respected personalities\nassembled here.  As most of us already know, we call these predictive\ngimmicks as &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; these days.   \n\n \n\nWhen I was asked by Shri Bhasin about the heading of my talk, I had thought\nof making it as &quot;Vedic Astrology - the greatest fraud on the Vedas&quot;.  On\nsecond thoughts, fearing that it would be too explosive a heading, I made it\na sugar coated bitter pill by changing it to &quot;Do we celebrate our festivals\non correct days?&quot;.\n\n \n\nWell, actually, both i.e., the fraud known as &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; and &quot;our\ncelebrating all our festivals on wrong days&quot; are inter-related. \n\nLet me start with &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;  -  as to why I call it a fraud!\n\nThere is hardly anyone in India, who does not want to know as to when his\n&quot;sade-sati&quot; will start or end or as to which Dasha-antardasha he is running\nand when that will end etc. etc. even if he does not know ABC of jyotisha.\nI have gone through all those pangs myself and made a thorough study of all\nthe astrological works besides a lot of astronomical books!  I studied\nWestern system of astrology also and had become a sort of famous astrologer,\nthough my predictions were as correct as anybody else&#39;s i.e. hardly 50%.\nHowever, this is a secret that no &quot;jyotishi&quot; shares with anybody -- that\nhis/her predictions are hardly more correct than fifty per cent, whatever\nlogic or Ayanamsha he/she may use!  When I analyzed the reasons for such a\ndismal rate of success, the conclusions were startling!  And I am keeping\nthose very conclusions before you!\n\n \n\nBefore proceeding further, I must, however, say something about myself since\nyou are well within your rights to ask me as to what &quot;qualifications&quot; I have\nto demolish  astrology that is being practised over the last several\ncenturies, nay even millennia!\n\n \n\nMy credentials Though I am not laying any claims to being a scholar,\nhowever, I have actually studied all the four Vedas in original &quot;archaic&quot;\nSanskrit with their different &quot;Bhashyas&quot;, besides the various Brahmanas\nlike Shatapatha, Aitreya, Tatiriya etc. etc. I have studied, (in original\nSanskrit!) about two hundred all the important Upanishads as well! I have\nalso gone through both the epics viz. the Valmiki Ramayana and the\nMahabharata --- in  Sanskrit and from cover to cover, besides Adhyatma\nRamayana, Ramacharitamanasa etc. etc.! There is hardly any Purana whether\nthe Bhagavata, Shivapurana, Vishnu, Narada, Devi, Varaha, Matsya and\nVishnudharmotara etc. etc. that I have not gone through in original\nSanskrit. I have also studied exhaustively all the ancient astronomical\nworks like the Vedanga Jyotisha, Panchasidhantika, Surya Sidhanta, Arya\nBhati, Sidhanta Shiromani etc. etc. To crown it all, I was not a born\nrenegade against the established traditions.  On the other hand, I was\ninitially &quot;hypnotized&quot; by &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; and &quot;panchangas&quot; myself and\nthere is hardly any &quot;text-book&quot; of astrology either in Sanskrit or Urdu or\nEnglish or Hindi that I have not studied with due reverence, as if I was\nstudying the Vedas! \n\n \n\nHaving established my credentials thus, I CAN DECLARE IT WITHOUT ANY\nHESITATION AND WITH ALL THE EMPHASIS AT MY COMMAND,  THAT THERE IS\nABSOLUTELY NO PREDICTIVE ASTROLOGY IN ANY OF THE VEDAS, UPANISHADAS OR\nBRAHMANAS. There are, however, some references to some odd types of\npredictions in some of the Puranas and the epics and therefore calling it as\nreally a post-Vedic astrology is more correct.  There is a rider there also,\nand that is that according to these scriptures, Makara Sankranti i.e. Pongal\nis nothing but a synonym of Uttarayana (the shortest day of the year) i.e.\nWinter Solstice and as everybody knows, it can take place these days only on\nor around December 21 every year.  Thus the Uttarayana-cum-Makar Sankranti\nthat we are celebrating now-a-days on January 14 is absolutely wrong and\ndoes not have any authority from any shastra or even modern astronomy.\nSimilarly, the Vaishakhi that is being celebrated on April 14 or so also is\nwrong since Mesha Sankranti is nothing but Vishuva (Vernal Equinox) or\nVasant Sampat and it cannot take place on any  day other than March 21/22,\nwhen the day and night are equal. Actually these Makara etc. sankrantis were\nknown as Tapah etc. months during the Vedic period as there are no rashis in\nthe Vedas but just six seasons and Madhu, Madhava etc. twelve months.  As\nsuch, we are celebrating all our fasts, fairs and muhurtas on wrong days  --\nthanks to &quot;Vedic astrologers&quot;  and their &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;. \n\n \n\n The first and foremost thing I learnt from our shastras is that no system\nof predictions has any sanction  either from the Vedas  or even Puranas\nleast of all our dharmashastras etc. since all our shastras admonish us from\nconsulting &quot;nakshatra jeevis&quot; so much so that the Manusmriti calls these\nnakshatrasoochis as outcastes and not fit to sit in any sabha of learned\npeople.\n\nThose who can foresee our future do not reveal it to us beforehand:\n\nAll the Ramayanas, whether Valmiki or Adhyatma or Ramacharitamanasa etc.\netc. say that before deciding about the coronation of Bhagwan Rama,\nDashratha wanted his guru Vasishtha to confirm the suitable muhurta for that\nfunction.  It was on the advice of  Vasishtha Muni that Dasharatha decided\nto anoint Rama as the Yuvraja the very next day, as it was &quot;Tishya&quot;  i.e.\nPushya nakshata then.  From this anecdote, it is clear that either Vasishtha\nMuni did not know as to what was going to happen to Dasharatha by declaring\nBhagwan Rama as a crown-prince or Vasishtha kept quiet deliberately since he\ndid not want to interfere in the divine dispensation!\n\n \n\nObviously, being the son of Brahmaji and a highly exalted yogi as well as a\njnyani, Vasishtha-muni could peep into past as well as future.  It means\nthat even if some exalted souls can foresee as to what is going to happen,\nthey do not reveal our &quot;bhavishya&quot; before hand, unlike some of the\nastrologers of today, who masquerade as &quot;Parasharas&quot; and &quot;Vamadevas&quot; to tell\nus even our past and future janmas just by glancing at our birth-charts,\neven if those charts are wrong!\n\n \n\nThe Gita is said to be the gist of all our shastras.  When Arjuna expressed\nhis doubt by saying naitadvidmah katarnno gareeyo, yadva jayema yadi va no\njayeyuh &quot;I do not know what is good for me nor do I know whether we will win\nor the Kauravas will win the war&quot;, Bhagwan Krishna neither asked him to\nconsult some soothsayer nor did He tell him to wear some ruby!  He just\nadvised Arjuna &quot;hato va prapsyasi swargam jitva va bokshyase maheem&quot;  i.e.\n&quot;You must fight.  If you get killed in the war, you will go to the heavens\nand if you win it you will be the lord of the whole world&quot;.\n\nThus all it boils down to is the fact that those who know (including Lord\nKrishna Himself!) as to what is going to happen and when do not divulge such\n&quot;secrets&quot; before hand to us.\n\n \n\nRemedial measures are a farce: Almost all the jyotishis suggest one or the\nother remedial measure to their clients, and mostly these are gems like\ndiamond or ruby or sapphire etc. etc.  What is surprising is that we have\nbecome so obsessed with Jyotish that we forget the entire itihasa of our\npast!\n\n(i)     If these gems are that efficacious, why was then Dasharatha not\nsuggested some &quot;ruby&quot; or &quot;coral&quot; to ward off the evil Dasha that was going\nto kill him when Rama would leave for the forests?  Well, because our Rishis\ndid not believe in such gimmicks at all!\n\n(ii) Bhagwan Krishna was born in a prison  ---   I wonder why He could not\nuse some    &quot;sapphire&quot; to be born in a palace!\n\n (iii) Vasudeva and Devaki---the parents of Bhagwan Krishna--- were in\nchains when He was born! It is said that Lord Krishna was a complete - 16\nkala sampoorna  --- divine incarnation of Vishnu and was thus really\nOmnipotent, Omnipresent and Omniscient!  But in spite of His Omniscience,\nOmnipotence and Omnipresence, Lord Krishna could not relieve the miseries of\nhis parents, Vasudeva and Devaki, who had to remain in chains till Krishna\nkilled Kansa!\n\nWhat does it demonstrate?  Just the fact that if the Omniscient, Omnipresent\nand Omnipotent Krishna could not relieve the miseries of His own father or\nmother before the appointed time, how can a ruby or a sapphire---or some\nMangala or Shani yagya--- remove all our miseries or fulfil all our\nambitions?  Obviously, we are being taken for a ride by such Jyotishis!\n\niv) Then not in the distant past, Smti Indira Gandhi would run after\nastrologers for knowing her future.  She wore a rare and original ekamukhi\nrudraksha, which only either the Maharaja of Nepal had or she was wearing!\nIt is said that some top-notch jyotishis had suggested that rudraksha to\nher!  Ironically, both the King of Nepal as well Mrs. Indira Gandhi were\nassassinated &quot;by the people&quot; they &quot;had trusted&quot;----ekamukhi rudraksha not\nwithstanding! What does it prove?  That we should not be hoodwinked by\nsoothsayers!\n\nv) Then again a well known Tantrik of yore---highly respected by the then\nPM--- is out on bail, not by dint of his &quot;Tantra-Kriya&quot; but because of some\nlegal loopholes in FERA!\nSimilarly, Dhirendra Brahmachari, another high profile &quot;Tantrik&quot;, met with\nan accident in the plane he was flying himself!  If he could not see his own\ndeath looming large how could he forewarn others!\n\n\nWhat does that prove?  Obviously, it warns us against relying on any\nsoothsayers, especially if they call themselves &quot;Vedic Jyotishis&quot; since they\nare taking us for a ride literally. \n\nKalasarpa Dosha  -- a non-existent fear psychosis: These days we hear a lot\nabout Kalasarpa Dosha!  It is said to be present in any horoscope if all the\nplanets are between Rahu and Ketu!  My God!  What a humbug!  Rahu and Ketu\nare actually nodes of the Moon!  That means they are just mathematical\npoints without any dimensions ---therefore without any physical existence\nwhatsoever!  So according to &quot;Vedic astrologers&quot; even such &quot;non-existent&quot;\nphenomena can make our lives miserable for which we must do some upay!  Do\nyou need any other proofs for the jugglery that these cheats are indulging\nin?\n\nTHE ONLY EFFECTIVE REMEDY, or UPAY, THEREFORE, IS THAT WE MUST REMEMBER HIM,\nTHE ALMIGHTY, EVERY MOMENT OF OUR LIVES AND LEAVE EVERY THING TO HIS DIVINE\nWILL!.  \n\n \n\nFake Brighu Samhitas and Parasharis:\n\nWe find a Brighu Samhita or a nadi Jyotishi or Aruna Samhita etc. in every\nMuhalla these days!  However, there is no mention in any of the Puranas or\nshastras that any Rishi like Vasishtha or Garga or Brighu etc. have ever\nwritten any books on predictive astrology.  The Vishnu Purana by Parashara\nis  full of astronomical references ---and that also sayana i.e. the\nseasonal year when Mesha sankranti is another name of Spring Equinox and so\non, but we do not find any mention of any Brihat Parashara Hora Shastra\nthere!  Obviously, it is the worst concoction that can ever be had, and may\nbe that is why such a Parashari is the bible of &quot;Vedic astrologers&quot;\n\n\nIndia has gone downhill because of astrology and astrologers: In India, we\nhave started going downhill ever since our rulers started running after\nJyotishis.  In ancient days, during the time of the Mahabharata, it was a\ndharma yudha that we had to fight against our own Duryodhanas but ever since\nthe advent of astrology almost simultaneously with the invasion of Alexander\nthe Great, and then the &quot;Yavana Jatakam&quot; of Sphujidwaja and the Surya\nSidhanta of Maya the Yavana (mlechha!),  we had to fight outsiders!  The\nmore the foreigners invaded us the more our rulers, instead of making a\nunited effort against the invaders, started consulting soothsayers whom they\ncalled Rajajyotishis! \n\n \n\nVarahamihira the worst culprit:\n\nThe maximum credit for creating such a fear psychosis of omens and ghosts\nand ghouls and storms   and even clouds goes to Varahamihira of 5th century\nAD through his Brihat Samita and Brihat Jatakam and Panchasidhantika!\nBefore venturing into the battlefield, our monarchs would ask their\nsoothsayers to prepare &quot;narpati jaya charya&quot; and consult Brihat Samhita etc.\nto see whether the &quot;ketuchara&quot; was favourable at that time or not!  No\nwonder with such a preliminary and hopeless knowledge of astronomical facts,\nwe were being pushed back into dark ages by Varahamihira and his followers!\n\n \n\nOur historical records are witness to the fact that we were   vanquished in\nevery battle, whether it was with Alexander the Great or Muhamud of Gazni or\nChengiz Khan or Nadir Shah or the Moguls  or finally the East India Company,\nthanks to the dependence of our monarchs on soothsayers (Rajajyotishis,\nhuh!) instead of the principles of war strategy and statecraft as adumbrated\nby the Vedas, the Manu and even Chanakya, who chided kings for consulting\nsoothsayers!\n\n\nBJP the latest example:\n\nThe fate of the BJP has not been any better than that of our earlier\nmonarchs by depending more on their &quot;Vedic Jyotishis&quot; who were responsible\nfor getting &quot;Vedic Jyotisha (sic!)&quot; prescribed in Indian Universities!  It\nis that very move that boomeranged on the party and even the &quot;Minister of\nastrology&quot; did not win his own parliamentary seat from Allahabad, let alone\nbeing the Union Minister again. Do you need any other proofs of the fact\nthat these &quot;Vedic Jyotishis&quot;  will make you lose your seat of power well\nbefore the appointed day just by making you advance your elections?\n\n \n\n If we continue to follow the trend of our &quot;monarchs&quot; of having blind faith\nin our soothsayers, then  sooner than later we will become Babylon of\nyesteryears, which is known as Iraq today!\n\n \n\nKashmiri Pandits were the worst affected by their blind faith in Jyotishis:\n\n Another reason for my revolt against the so called &quot;Vedic astrology&quot; is\nthat as a Kashmiri Pandit, I have more to  blame panchanga makers and\nsoothsayers and their predictive gimmicks than anything or anybody else\nsince they never forewarned us about any calamities that were going to\nbefall us!  On the other hand, just to prove their astrological gimmicks,\nthey just made ---and are still making --- us celebrate all our festivals,\nincluding Mahashivaratri, Vasanti Navratras, Ramanavami, Janmashtami and\nSharadiya navratras etc. on wrong days. It is these very jyotishis, whom we\nhad treated as our friends, philosophers and guides, who are responsible for\nour downfall as Kahsmiri Pandits, since they proved neither our friends, nor\nphilosophers least of all our guides!  These Panchanga makers/jyotishis were\nthe first to flee from Kashmir  in 1990--- like the king Hari Singh at the\ntime of Pakistani raid in 1948--- since they had already made their\nalternate homes in safer places like  Jammu and Delhi.   Those Jyotishis\njust proved to be Shylocks, who were only interested in their Pound of flesh\nby way of Dakshinas for janmapatris and matching of horoscopes  -- all\ncheating and nothing else!\n\n \n\nThese soothsayers have such a hypnotic grip on us that initially even I was\nbrain washed to believe that the Vedas had nothing else to do excepting\nteaching us predictive astrology!  I was so convinced that it appeared that\neven the principle of Secondary Progressions must have been exported from\nIndia to Western countries as the principle of &quot;A day equals a year&quot; was\nmentioned in our Vedas!  But thank God, I woke up to the situation and could\nsee through their tricks.\n\nThere are no Mesha, Vrisha  etc. Rashis in the Vedas:  \n\n Leave alone predictive gimmicks, actually there are neither rashis like\nMesha, Vrisha etc. nor planets like Mangal, Shani etc. in the  Vedas,\nUpanishads, Brahmanas etc. Similarly, the Vedanga Jyotisha, the first\nindigenous astronomical work of 14th century BCE, just tells us only as to\nhow to calculate tithi, nakshatra and Uttarayana-cum-Tapah-cum Magha etc.\nmonths.  It does not list any Mesha etc. rashis nor any planets like Mangal,\nBudha etc.  Same is the case with Yajur Jyotisha of about 11th century BCE\nand later Atharva Jyotisha of about 5th century BCE, which does not have any\nRashis though it talks of planets.  As such, it is really a fraud on the\nVedas being played by some charlatans to call any predictive gimmicks as\nVedic astrology and hail themselves as &quot;Vedic Jyotishis&quot;. It is a crime\nunder &quot;The Consumer Protection Act&quot; as it is a misrepresentation of facts to\na client and is thus a deficiency in service.  \n\n \n\nOur predictions in the past also could never have been correct:\n\n It is said that over the past about 2000 years, our ancestors like\nVarahamihira or his son Prithuyashas etc., could make marvellously correct\npredictions. THAT IS NOTHING BUT HOGWASH! Let us see how: prior to the\nadvent of scientific astronomy into India, i.e. about a couple of centuries\nback, panchangas were based on astronomical works like the Surya Sidhanta or\nAryabhati or Sidhanta Shirmoani etc. etc.  I have prepared a software called\n&quot;Mahesh&quot;.  It calculates, apart from the actual tithi, nakshatra, yoga,\nkarna etc., the mean longitudes of all the planets from 10000 BCE to 12030\nAD i.e. for more than 22,000 years as per the Surya Sidhanta, Aryabhati or\nSidhanta Shiromani etc. besides comparing them with the longitudes as per\nmodern astronomy. Anybody can download it freely from my discussion forum\n\n http://groups.yahoo.com/group/HinduCalendar\n\nUnfortunately for these jyotishis, we find that the very fundamental\narguments of these sidahntas like the Surya Sidhanta, the Aryabhati, the\nSidhanta Shiromani etc. etc. are absolutely wrong!  .  \n\nThat naturally means that any panchanga based on them would also be wrong,\nwith the result that any horoscope prepared on the basis of those panchangas\ncould never be correct. Thus it is impossible for any astrological\npredictions to have been correct in the past!  As such, it is all like the\nfamous couplet of Ghalib  &quot;yoon to hai  hamko janat ki haqeeqat maloom\nlekin; dil ke bahlane ko Ghalib yeh khayal achha hai&quot;\n\n \n\nAstrology cannot be a science Predictive astrology is supposed to be a\n&quot;science&quot;!  What a preposterous statement! When the data on which\npredictions were based or are based these days are not correct, how can the\nresults be correct and how can we call it a science at all? \n\n \n\nStars do not affect us:\n\n It is said that stars affect us!  It appears either these astrologers have\ngone honkers themselves or they suppose that the whole world has really gone\nmad!  Let us see how:\nI am a puny human being on this small planet called earth.  The sun is\nhundreds of thousands of times larger than the earth! And there are other\nstars of our nakshatra/rashichakra that are supposed to affect me\nindividually as per the Dasha-Bhukti that is running in my horoscope!\nHowever, this fantastic statement has no leg to stand upon since the nearest\nstar of that Rashichakra is Shravana! And do you know its distance from me?\nIt is seventeen light years!  And it is several times larger than our sun!\nIn other words, if that star wants i.e. Shravana wants to &quot;affect&quot; me\nindividually, it will take it at least seventeen years to do so even if that\n&quot;effect&quot; travels at the speed of light!  And by then, my Rahu or Shani or\nwhatever Dasha it may be must have been over! Then how can such a star which\nis trillions of times larger than me send its rays in a concentrated form\njust to haunt me at a particular point of time!  Can you imagine what type\nof laughing stocks we are making of ourselves  by believing in such hocus\npocus!\nSimilarly, the next nearest star of our Rashichakra is Swati !  It is away\nby 26 light years from me \n\nand is again several times larger than our sun!!\n\nIt thus defies imagination as to how we can call astrology a science or how\nit can be said that the &quot;Stars affect us&quot;.\n\n \n\nPatri Melapak (Horoscope Matching) is not warranted by shastras nor\nastrology books:\n\n Now coming to the fad called Patri Melapak  i.e. horoscope matching!  This\nfad is the rage of the day! You will be surprised to know that none of our\nshastras, whether the Manusmriti or the Ramayana or the Mahabharata, leave\nalone the Vedas, have anything to do with Patri Melapak even by mistake!  We\ndo not find any instances that any Vedic Rishi was addicted to such a fad,\nsince may be then most of them would still have been looking for a &quot;suitable\nPatri&quot; for melapak! Not to speak of Dharma shastras, there is no mention of\nthis type of a malady in any of the astrology books like the so called\nParashari, or Mansagari or Phala Deepika or Jataka Parijata or any other\nwork!  It appears to be a creation of the jyotishis of over the last  one\nhundred years or so. Aleberuni, who visited India in 1030 AD and  recorded\nquite faithfully all his experiences about Jyotisha and other things in\nIndia also has not mentioned anything of any &quot;Melapak&quot; in his work!\n\n&quot;All India Calendar Reform Committee&quot;:\n\nSumming up, as we have just seen, not only are we subjected to non-existent\nfear psychosis like Kalasarpa Dosha and Patri Melapak etc. but we are\ncompelled to celebrate all our festivals on worng days.      There are quite\na few people who agree with my point of view that these days we are\ncelebrating Pitra Amavasya on the day of Dipavali and marriages during\nPitra-Paksha!  Similarly, we never celebrate Makar Sankranti on correct days\ni.e. December 21/22 but we celebrate it on January 14.  We also celebrate\nVaishakhi on April 14 instead of the day of Spring Equinox i.e., March 21 or\nso.  This has been all because of the so called &quot;Vedic astrology&quot;\n\nTo put our festivals back on the right track, I made quite a few\nrepresentations to the Hon&#39;ble President of India, the Prime Minister of\nIndia, various ministries besides the Positional Astronomy Centre at\nCalcutta, who publish our Rashtriya Panchanga.  I also made similar\nrepresentations to all the reverred Shankaracharyas of all the six peethas,\nbesides other saints and Mahatmas, but sorry to say, there has been\nabsolutely no response from any quarter!\n\nWe  have now formed an &quot;All India Calendar Reform Committee&quot; and are\nenrolling members for the same.  Those interested can log on to\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/HinduCalendar  for entering into discussions\nregarding the same.  You can also get a list of correct dates of festivals\nfor 2006 and 2007 from that forum. As an alternative, you can get in touch\nwith me whenever you want to for any further clarifications.\n\nThank you very much for listening to this &quot;exhortation&quot; against &quot;Vedic\nastrology&quot; and the efforts I am making to streamline our calendars.\nOm tat sat brahmarpanam astu\n\nAvtar Krishen Kaul\n\nPresident \n\nAll India Calendar Reform Committee\n\nH.

Sanskrit with their different\n&#8220;Bhashyas&#8221;, besi=\r\ndes the various Brahmanas&nbsp; like Shatapatha,\nAitreya, Tatiriya etc. etc=\r\n. I have studied, (in original Sanskrit!) about two\nhundred all the importa=\r\nnt Upanishads as well! I have also gone through both the\nepics viz. the Val=\r\nmiki Ramayana and the Mahabharata --- in&nbsp; Sanskrit and\nfrom cover to c=\r\nover, besides Adhyatma Ramayana, Ramacharitamanasa etc. etc.!\nThere is hard=\r\nly any Purana whether the Bhagavata, Shivapurana, Vishnu, Narada,\nDevi, Var=\r\naha, Matsya and Vishnudharmotara etc. etc. that I have not gone\nthrough in =\r\noriginal Sanskrit. I have also studied exhaustively all the ancient\nastrono=\r\nmical works like the Vedanga Jyotisha, Panchasidhantika, Surya Sidhanta,\nAr=\r\nya Bhati, Sidhanta Shiromani etc. etc. To crown it all, I was not a born\nre=\r\nnegade against the established traditions.&nbsp; On the other hand, I was\ni=\r\nnitially &#8220;hypnotized&#8221; by &#8220;Vedic astrology&#8221; and\n&#82=\r\n20;panchangas&#8221; myself and there is hardly any &#8220;text-book&#8221;=\r\n\nof astrology either in Sanskrit or Urdu or English or Hindi that I have no=\r\nt\nstudied with due reverence, as if I was studying the Vedas! &lt;b&gt;&lt;span\nstyl=\r\ne=3D&#39;font-weight:bold&#39;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=\r\n=3DMsoNormal style=3D&#39;text-align:justify;text-indent:.5in&#39;&gt;&lt;font size=3D1\nf=\r\nace=3DVerdana&gt;&lt;span lang=3DEN-GB style=3D&#39;font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verda=\r\nna&#39;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3DMsoNormal style=3D&#39;text=\r\n-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;font size=3D1 face=3DVerdana&gt;&lt;span\nlang=3DEN-GB style=3D&#39;f=\r\nont-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana&#39;&gt;Having established my\ncredentials thus,=\r\n I CAN DECLARE IT WITHOUT ANY HESITATION &lt;st1:stockticker\nw:st=3D&quot;on&quot;&gt;AND&lt;/=\r\nst1:stockticker&gt; WITH &lt;st1:stockticker w:st=3D&quot;on&quot;&gt;ALL&lt;/st1:stockticker&gt;\nTH=\r\nE EMPHASIS AT MY COMMAND, &nbsp;THAT THERE IS ABSOLUTELY NO PREDICTIVE\nASTR=\r\nOLOGY IN ANY OF THE VEDAS, UPANISHADAS OR BRAHMANAS. There are, however,\nso=\r\nme references to some odd types of predictions in some of the Puranas and t=\r\nhe\nepics and therefore calling it as really a post-Vedic astrology is more\n=\r\ncorrect.&nbsp; There is a rider there also, and that is that according to t=\r\nhese\nscriptures, Makara Sankranti i.e. Pongal is nothing but a synonym of U=\r\nttarayana\n(the shortest day of the year) i.e. Winter Solstice and as everyb=\r\nody knows, it\ncan take place these days only on or around December 21 every=\r\n year.&nbsp; Thus\nthe Uttarayana-cum-Makar Sankranti that we are celebratin=\r\ng now-a-days on\nJanuary 14 is absolutely wrong and does not have any author=\r\nity from any shastra\nor even modern astronomy.&nbsp; Similarly, the Vaishak=\r\nhi that is being\ncelebrated on April 14 or so also is wrong since Mesha San=\r\nkranti is nothing but\nVishuva (Vernal Equinox) or Vasant Sampat and it cann=\r\not take place on any\n&nbsp;day other than March 21/22, when the day and nig=\r\nht are equal. Actually\nthese Makara etc. sankrantis were known as Tapah etc=\r\n. months during the Vedic\nperiod as there are no rashis in the Vedas but ju=\r\nst six seasons and Madhu,\nMadhava etc. twelve months.&nbsp; As such, we are=\r\n celebrating all our fasts,\nfairs and muhurtas on wrong days&nbsp; -- thank=\r\ns to &#8220;Vedic\nastrologers&#8221;&nbsp; and their &#8220;Vedic astrology=\r\n&#8221;. &lt;o:p&gt;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3DMsoNormal style=3D&#39;text-=\r\nalign:justify;text-indent:.5in&#39;&gt;&lt;font size=3D1\nface=3DVerdana&gt;&lt;span lang=3D=\r\nEN-GB style=3D&#39;font-size:9.0pt;font-family:Verdana&#39;&gt;&lt;o:p&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/o:p&gt;&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p class=3DMsoNormal style=3D&#39;text-align:justify&#39;&gt;&lt;font size=\r\n=3D1 face=3DVerdana&gt;&lt;span\nlang=3DEN-GB style=3D&#39;font-size:9.0pt;font-family=\r\n:Verdana&#39;&gt;&nbsp;The first and\nforemost thing I learnt from our shastras is =\r\nthat no system of predictions has\nany sanction&nbsp;
