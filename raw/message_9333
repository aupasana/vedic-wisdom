He urged them to understand what true H=\r\ninduism is, what a true\nArya is and become true Arya =96 noble ones. The Pa=\r\nkistani brothers and\nsisters agreed with wet eyes.\n\n*Dr D K Garg asked them=\r\n to take a promise that they will shun all vices\nforever  and say no to alc=\r\nohol, tobacco, smoking, meat. They all willfully\nagreed. He also offered jo=\r\nbs to 50 of them in his organization along with\nhome, electricity and every=\r\n other facility for dignified living.
