My replies inlined, please see=\r\n..\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; You said &quot;matter is all that can be sensed =\r\n(by the 5 senses)&quot;. I want to make a clarification on this from the Upanish=\r\nadic perspective.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Vedic paradigm, senses do not mean physical sense=\r\ns. Sensory organs (jnaanedriyas) are not part of the physical body (annamay=\r\na kosha), but part of the mental body (manomaya kosha).\n&gt; \n&gt; I may &quot;see&quot; a =\r\npicture of Sri MahaLakshmi in front of me now. When I close my eyes and med=\r\nitate, I may &quot;see&quot; something else. When I sleep and get a dream, I may &quot;see=\r\n&quot; something else. The jnaanendriya of vision is a part of the mind and not =\r\nbody. It may connect to the physical eye and &quot;see&quot; some objects or connect =\r\nto something else and &quot;see&quot; some other objects. In Upanishadic paradigm, we=\r\n do not consider one of them to be superior to the other.\n\nSundeep&gt; I&#39;m puz=\r\nzled. Simply because the jnanendriyas are *part* of the manomaya kosa doesn=\r\nt *automatically* (i.e. using logical inference) mean that they *sense* the=\r\n contents of the chitta (i.e. the memory &quot;aspect&quot; of antahakarana). Or are =\r\nyou asserting that this is true? This is new information to me. It seemed t=\r\no me, from virtually all the sources that I have examined, that the manas i=\r\ns the seat of &quot;samkalpa/vikalpa&quot; where I understand vikalpa to mean &quot;to con=\r\nceive&quot;/&quot;form a conception of&quot; (a memory/material object). Jnanendriyas woul=\r\nd be one set of inputs to the manas (leading to the conception of ideas of =\r\npancha mahabuta reality i.e. &quot;matter&quot; in the western sense of the word), an=\r\nd of course the other set of inputs would be memory or chitta (or at least =\r\na part of it). If what you imply is true (that all ideation necessarily goe=\r\ns through jnanendriyas), then jnanendriyas would be awake in dream sleep. A=\r\nre they? Also, then people would worship some symbolism of jnanendriyas in =\r\norder to get deeper knowledge of their chitta. Is this correct too? In any =\r\ncase, how exactly is this relevant to the discussion at hand. Please elabor=\r\nate.\n\n\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; Instead of using the terms matter and=\r\n proto-matter, let us use the word &quot;dual consciousness&quot; to describe all obj=\r\nects in the field of duality. This includes objects that can be perceived b=\r\ny the physical senses (&quot;matter&quot; in your terminology) and objects that canno=\r\nt be perceived by the physical senses (&quot;proto-matter&quot; in your terminology).=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The abstraction in Upanishadic paradigm is this:\n&gt; \n&gt; There exists &quot;n=\r\non-dual consciousness&quot;, which is sat-chid-aananda (pure truth, pure awarene=\r\nss, pure bliss) as you say. This is represented by Shiva. Then there exists=\r\n &quot;dual consciousness&quot;, which is represented by Shakti. Dual consciousness h=\r\nas boundaries and infinite objects in it, while non-dual consciousness is u=\r\nndivided.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; However, if one takes the dual consciousness in its en=\r\ntirety, it is non-different from non-dual consciousness. This fact is also =\r\nrepresented by saying that Shiva and Shakti are in reality one and not two.=\r\n If one self-identifies with the ENTIRE &quot;dual consciousness&quot;, then one is a=\r\nbsorbed in the dual-consciousness in its entirety, which is non-different f=\r\nrom non-dual consciousness. In other words, one is absorbed in non-dual con=\r\nsciousness. That is Nirvikalpa Samadhi.\n&gt; \n&gt; The problem is not dual consci=\r\nousness. Dual consciousness is identical to non-dual consciousness in the a=\r\nbsence of self-identification with any limited objects of dual consciousnes=\r\ns. Hence the problem is not dual consciousness, but the self-identification=\r\n or I-ness or egosense or ahamkaara or asmitaa, to a limited aspect of dual=\r\n consciousness.\n\n\nSundeep&gt; Narasimhaji, you are playing word games with me.=\r\n The reason I coined &quot;proto-matter&quot; was specifically to bring clearly into =\r\nview the logical quandary that exists in the notion of I - a concept that h=\r\nas validity/basis ONLY in the &quot;world&quot; of dual consciousness. You seek to sw=\r\neep that VERY distinction back under the carpet, and no wonder you lose sig=\r\nht of the question I ask. Ok, so I&#39;ll let it go. Then we&#39;re back to square =\r\none: Who/what is this &quot;one&quot; that is absorbed in non-dual consciousness? Qua=\r\nntify it exactly, please. \n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; \n&gt; A normal person&#39;s=\r\n self-identification is symbolized by one&#39;s Kundalini shakti. When Kundalin=\r\ni is asleep, one is instinctively identifying with a body-name-entity and s=\r\ntuck in the delusion of duality. As Kundalini wakes up and starts rising, o=\r\nne&#39;s self-identification is refined further and further. \n\nSundeep&gt; Narasim=\r\nhaji, quantify this &quot;one&quot; please? What are the boundaries of this &quot;self ide=\r\nntification&quot;. When you say self identification, you implicitly, unbeknownst=\r\n to yourself, are creating a distinction between an inner I and an outer I.=\r\n When the inner I assumes that the outer I is part of itself, you call it s=\r\nelf identification. When it doesnt, you call it self knowledge. I want to k=\r\nnow what this inner I is in vedic terms. Is it simply Ahamkara? Is Ahamkara=\r\n a single indivisible entity - either there or not there? Is it conscious o=\r\nf itself - list, in vedic terminology, the quantities/materials/things it i=\r\ns conscious of, and how those quantities change as kundalini rises? Is it (=\r\nAhamkara) the one that enters into NVKS, or does it progressively decay as =\r\nit becomes more conscious of itself (in which it case it is not an indivisi=\r\nble entity)? If you agree with the preceding statement, then Ahamkara, AND =\r\nCONSEQUENTLY THE SUBJECT/EXPERIENCER/OBSERVER, terminate upon reaching NVKS=\r\n, thereby not leaving a &quot;one&quot; who can come out of the NVKS. \n\n\n\n&gt;Some also =\r\nsay that one&#39;s shakti is getting purified further and &gt;further. Even when K=\r\nundalini is at Ajna or one of the chakras &gt;between Ajna and Sahasrara, one&#39;=\r\ns self-identification is with a &gt;subset of dual consciousness and nor with =\r\nthe entirety of dual &gt;consciousness. There are still notions of I and other=\r\ns, current &gt;time, past, future etc. When Kundalini is at Sahasraara, we say=\r\n that &gt;Kundalini shakti is perfectly purified. In other words, one&#39;s &gt;self-=\r\nidentification is with the entire dual consciousness and there is no &gt;I and=\r\n others, current time, past and future etc. One identifies with \n\nSundeep&gt; =\r\nIn order for the correct logical exposition of your ideas, you must define =\r\nin terms of vedic terminology, who this &quot;one&quot; is that is identified with th=\r\ne entire dual consciousness. You imply some hazy form of expanded individua=\r\nlity - which needs to be brought out of the haze of implied understanding. =\r\nName and quantify (in vedic terms) the contents of that individuality.\n\nReg=\r\nards,\n\nSundeep\n\n\n\n\n"}}
