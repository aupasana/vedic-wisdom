It seems to be his extrapolation.\n \nWhat yo=\r\nu quoted from Taittariya Upanishad is the traditional view that I am famili=\r\nar with. Other scriptures refer to the same order of creation, including &quot;Y=\r\noga Vaasishtham&quot;, where Maharshi Vasishtha teaches creation, destruction an=\r\nd liberation to Lord Rama.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThis Upanishadic underst=\r\nanding is also consistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The fi=\r\nve chakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent =\r\nether, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, eart=\r\nh element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are e=\r\nffaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, wate=\r\nr element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of water element are e=\r\nffaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. And so on.\n \nBy earth and water etc, don&#39;t =\r\njust think of physical earth and physical water etc. Earth element shows a =\r\nsolid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible and fluid state of=\r\n existence. For example, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a=\r\n car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state and made of ea=\r\nrth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a hou=\r\nse, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of water element. Thus, di=\r\nfferent mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the five elements.\n \nWhe=\r\nn one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a body that looks and feels in a=\r\n particular way physically. Apart from the physical aspect, one may think o=\r\nf &quot;I&quot; as someone who has certain qualities, certain needs, certain belongin=\r\ngs etc. All those concepts one has about who one is, form one&#39;s self-awaren=\r\ness and Kundalini represents that self-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Mo=\r\nolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cum=\r\nulative idea of who one is is still remaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaad=\r\nhishthaana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* or *fluid* in nature withi=\r\nn one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. And so on.\n \nMany=\r\n people who talk about experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are often=\r\n talking merely about some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (which=\r\n may still be a nice experience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini actua=\r\nlly being there. IF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perc=\r\neive a solid body, one will not have notions of owning anything. Similarly,=\r\n as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each element is effaced in one&#39;s cumula=\r\ntive idea of who one is, at the physical as well as the subtle level of exi=\r\nstence! To completely efface even one element (earth) from one&#39;s notion of =\r\nself (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of time, is not at all easy.\n \nThe or=\r\nder in which elements are effaced as one progresses towards samadhi is - ea=\r\nrth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again comes down, effaced ele=\r\nments return to work in the reverse order - ether, air, fire, water and ear=\r\nth.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRegarding physics and spiritual realities:\n \n&gt; =\r\nDoes physics describe reality?\n \nPhysics tries to describe/model reality at=\r\n the gross physical level, as perceived by the external senses. However, on=\r\ne&#39;s mind can &quot;perceive&quot; things without the external senses playing a role.\n=\r\n \nAs a simple example, one may be asleep and get a dream, in which one&#39;s mi=\r\nnd may &quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between them. In another=\r\n example, a yogi may be meditating with a mantra with intense focus and &quot;se=\r\ne&quot; some scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot be perceived =\r\nby the external senses and hence cannot be studied by modern science.\n \nIt =\r\nis reasonable to define reality as something that can be perceived by the e=\r\nxternal senses, because different people can experience the same reality us=\r\ning their senses individually and verify the observation. However, some exp=\r\neriences of the mind that cannot be perceived by senses are sometimes very =\r\npowerful and have a huge, life-altering and sometimes liberating influence =\r\non people. Inability to study and model them is a big drawback of modern sc=\r\nience.\n \n*        *        *\n \nOne may categorize dreams and internal yogic=\r\n experiences as imaginations or hallucinations, because there is no indepen=\r\ndent validation, and call them unworthy of a study. But there are cases tha=\r\nt make one wonder. For example, see the following messages from the archive=\r\ns.\n \nMystical experiences of mind and mantras (message 951)\nhttp://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951\n \nIn the above message, one person =\r\nhad a specific yogic experience that was described in detail and another pe=\r\nrson seemed to know about it and supplied one tangible detail relating to t=\r\nhe experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the firs=\r\nt person, though it was beyond the external senses of either person!\n \nRe: =\r\nGuru (message 391)\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/391\n =\r\n\nIn the above message also, one person had a specific yogic experience that=\r\n was described in detail and another person seemed to know about it and sup=\r\nplied a couple of tangible details relating to the experience, suggesting t=\r\nhat he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first person, though it was bey=\r\nond the external senses of either person!\n \nInternal god and external god (=\r\nmessage 2498)\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2498\n \nIn =\r\nthe above message, one person had a specific yogic experience involving a d=\r\neity and another person perceived with his external senses a vision involvi=\r\nng the same deity, though others in the room could not perceive anything wi=\r\nth their external senses, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the =\r\nexperience of the first person through a specific prism.\n \n*        *      =\r\n  *\n \nSuch examples cannot prove much, but they do suggest that perhaps *so=\r\nme* experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses=\r\n are observable by others, though not everyone may be able to observe. Then=\r\n, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some* experiences that cannot be =\r\nmeasured or perceived by the external senses being a part of the &quot;reality&quot; =\r\nthat mind can access.\n \nBut, how can modern science study it?\n \nBecause the=\r\n only thing that can be studied and measured is the reality involving the g=\r\nross body and its senses, one may suggest that experiences of the subtle bo=\r\ndy may be studied by observing various parts of the gross physical body. Fo=\r\nr example, one can look at the nervous signals flowing through various part=\r\ns of the brain and try to correlate them with the experiences of the subtle=\r\n body.\n \nOn the surface, it sounds like a great idea. But, it assumes that =\r\nsubtle body and causal body are redundant. Though there is some corresponde=\r\nnce between what happens in the causal, subtle and gross bodies, it is a ma=\r\nny-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in which case the concept =\r\nof causal and subtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. whatever they model ca=\r\nn be moderled using just the gross body!\n \nIf you drive through a neighborh=\r\nood and observe the houses from the road, you can have *some* idea of what =\r\nis going on. A particular house with a lot of lights and sound and many car=\r\ns parked outside may be having a party. People in one particular house with=\r\n no lights are probably out of town. But you can never be sure what is goin=\r\ng on in the house, how many people are inside, what exactly they are doing =\r\netc, by merely looking at the house from outside.\n \nSimilarly, by looking a=\r\nt the nervous signals in various points of the brain, you may be able to se=\r\ne some basic things, but not much. The experiences of the subtle mind are b=\r\neyond your reach and study, if your tools are limited to the gross physical=\r\n domain.\n \n*        *        *\n \nUnfortunately, modern science cannot study=\r\n that part of the reality which is beyond the scope of external senses, unl=\r\ness scientists become yogis and develop mastery of the internal world.\n \nWh=\r\nile rishis of ancient times had mastery of the internal world (which is the=\r\n microcosm of the entire universe) and could observe any space-time point, =\r\neven the greatest yogis of today cannot control their state completely. Whe=\r\nn Kundalini rises, it may go somewhere and one may experience some part of =\r\nthe Infinite Reality. But one cannot control exactly where Kundalini goes a=\r\nnd exactly which part of the Infinite Reality one observes. Rishis seemed t=\r\no have a perfect control.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree =\r\nJyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Ce=\r\nntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n---------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n \n---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@y=\r\nahoo.co.in&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Sorry the previous mail went off incomplete. \n&gt;  \n&gt; D=\r\near Sundeep,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let me mention some stuff from the diaries of Sri Shamac=\r\nharun Lahiri (a self realized Yogi of the highest order) - it maybe of some=\r\n help to you. He did mention in details about the process of creation as he=\r\n saw it.\n&gt;  \n&gt; As per him, at the beginning was the point of ultimate chaos=\r\n.

Finding a correlation betw=\r\neen this and the idea of the five elements, in my humble opinion, is still =\r\nfar fetched. I can understand some correlation between basic Quantum Mechan=\r\nics, (at least the Copenhegan Interpretation), non-locality etc, and the id=\r\neas of Indian mysticism, but a link between M-theory of panch-mahabhuta?!..=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Well, with the kind permission of Narasimha, I would like to know mo=\r\nre about how exactly you can link these two, because I myself with my limit=\r\ned understand fail to see any viable correlation at all as of now, speciall=\r\ny, since the M-theory is yet in a very nascent stage.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The other thing=\r\n one must think about is the basic nature of theoritical physics. Does phys=\r\nics describe reality? Or does it provide a model of reality? These two are =\r\ndifferent. Mathematics provides a tool/model to gauge reality. It need not =\r\nbe exactly as reality is. \n&gt; Which is why Richard Feynman once famously quo=\r\nted that everyone knows that Quatum Mechanics works, but no one know what i=\r\nt really is!\n&gt;  \n&gt; The idea of the pach mahabhuta and creation is almost th=\r\ne essence of everything.
