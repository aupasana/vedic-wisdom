You can not realize your deity until your consciousnes=\r\ns becomes clear and clean, for which you have to burn off all your bad karm=\r\nas. As you become firmer in your sadhana, more and more of your bad karmas =\r\nfrom this life and from thousands of previous lives are liberated from your=\r\n casual body. You are bound to be affected by this - every one likes to spe=\r\nnd and no one likes to pay the bills - but don&#39;t let that stop you. continu=\r\ne on, continue until you achieve; then you will understand that it was 100%=\r\n worth it.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;This is Kaliyuga, though, and as soon as most people start=\r\n getting this negative effect from the removal of their bad karmas they thi=\r\nnk that it is somehow the fault of the mantra and they quit their practice =\r\naltogether, just at the point they should be doing it more vigorously.
