It\nseems that on the way to the hall some=\r\n monkey came, snatched some of the\nfruits and escaped.\n\nHearing the noise o=\r\nutside and realising what had happened, Bhagavan\nlaughingly said that the m=\r\nonkey took away its portion of the fruit as it was\nafraid we would not othe=\r\nrwise give it. We all laughed.\n\nWhile this was going on, a female monkey wi=\r\nth a baby at her breast approached\nthe fruit basket. People near the basket=\r\n shouted it away. Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CIt\nis a mother with a child. Why =\r\nnot give her something and send her away?=E2=80=9D\n\nBut he was not sufficie=\r\nntly audible, and so the monkey got frightened, went\noff and hid herself in=\r\n a tree.Bhagavan, full of pity and kindness, said, =E2=80=9CIs\nthis fair?\n\n=\r\nWe call ourselves sannyasins; but when a real sannyasi comes we drive him\na=\r\nway without giving him anything. How unfair! We want to eat for years and\nl=\r\nive. We store things in a room, lock it and keep the keys with us. Has the\n=\r\nmonkey got a house?\n\nCan it put anything by for the morrow? It eats whateve=\r\nr it can get and\nsleeps on whatever tree available. It carries the child un=\r\nder its belly,\nwherever it goes, until the child is able to walk about, whe=\r\nn it leaves the\nchild to itself. Who is a real sannyasi, the monkey or ours=\r\nelves? That is\nwhy the male monkey took its share on\nthe way itself.\n\nThat =\r\nwas a male and could do it with impunity. This is a female.
