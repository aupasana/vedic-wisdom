Narasimhaji, you say \n&gt; &quot;Depending on how you visualize a devatA and mantra and with what \n&gt; attitude, it works on you accordingly, within that range of \n&gt; possibilities&quot;. It seems to me that this visualization is a very \n&gt; personal internal image, very alive and active? In my case, and my \n&gt; knowledge is but a small fraction of yours, when doing Savitur \n&gt; Gayatri, I visualize a golden peace descending on me, and something \n&gt; flowing out of me to something higher. My visualization during the \n&gt; Kali mantra is of surrendering all of myself, as if I were cleaning \n&gt; out myself from the inside out, to some vague but very fierce Goddess \n&gt; form, and all my faults coming out of me like snakes, which are \n&gt; destroyed by the Goddess. I have reached these visualizations by trial \n&gt; and error - when I do these ones, I seem to concentrate on the mantra \n&gt; much better. But I wonder if this is conflicting imagery.. Also I have \n&gt; trouble strongly visualizing personified forms - most of the focus is \n&gt; always on colors, flows etc..\n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt;\n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste Sundeep,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When one does different mantras, they of course interfere with each \n&gt;&gt; other. But do not think in terms of deity X and deity Y not liking \n&gt;&gt; each other and doing their mantras together making them angry with \n&gt;&gt; you, etc. Deities are far more subtle than us.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If my son asks me how to study math, I may tell him to study for half \n&gt;&gt; hour, take some rest, have a snack, and study again. If he asks my \n&gt;&gt; wife the same thing, she may tell him sternly to study for 4 hours, \n&gt;&gt; before breaking. He better ask one of us and stick to what that \n&gt;&gt; person says. If he asks both and we give different directions, he \n&gt;&gt; will be confused. It is not that I and my wife dislike each other for \n&gt;&gt; giving a different advice. I know her and I am not surprised by her \n&gt;&gt; advice. Similarly, she knows me and she is not surprised by my \n&gt;&gt; advice. But it is better for my son to follow one approach.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Similarly, approach of savitA and kALI may be different.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Of course, it is not just deity&#39;s name or mantra. It is in your \n&gt;&gt; attitude and how you visualize/imagine the deity (consciously or even \n&gt;&gt; sub-consciously). I, for example, do a Chandi homam every morning. \n&gt;&gt; After the homam, as the poornaahuti burns, I meditate for half hour \n&gt;&gt; with savitR^i gAyatrI mantra. I do not feel weird about mixing \n&gt;&gt; chanDIpAtha (durgA saptashati) and gAyatrI mantra. Even as I invoke \n&gt;&gt; Chandi in fire and read durgAsaptashati, I visualize Aadyaa \n&gt;&gt; Mahalakshmi, the shakti of the supreme cosmic being, who divided \n&gt;&gt; herself into Mahalakshmi, Mahakali and Mahasaraswati. The dhyana \n&gt;&gt; shloka I use for invocation is &quot;sarvasyAdyA mahAlakShmI triguNA \n&gt;&gt; parameshvarI lakShyAlakShyasvarUpA yA vyApya kR^itsnaM \n&gt;&gt; vyavasthitA...&quot; So my visualization of the devata is highly saattwik \n&gt;&gt; and close to that of savitA and sAvitrI!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Someone else may be visualizing Chandi as someone fierce and angry \n&gt;&gt; and cutting off heads with umpteen weapons etc.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Each devatA and mantra has a range of possibilities. Depending on how \n&gt;&gt; you visualize a devatA and mantra and with what attitude, it works on \n&gt;&gt; you accordingly, within that range of possibilities. It is always \n&gt;&gt; better to stick to one mantra for a few months or years. Of course, \n&gt;&gt; people who have such dense conditioning that mantras do not really \n&gt;&gt; have any immediately visible impact on their consciousness, may do as \n&gt;&gt; many mantras as they want. If you see that some mantras are having a \n&gt;&gt; visible impact on you, it is a good sign. But it is better then to \n&gt;&gt; use the feedback and stick to one mantra.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; You may want to experiment with homam with the Kali mantra that is \n&gt;&gt; helping you deal with your problems better.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In Kali yuga, Vishnu sahasra naama stotra and Chandipath are two \n&gt;&gt; stotras that are said to work effectively. Consider experimenting \n&gt;&gt; with Chandipath, perhaps one chapter a day.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt;&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; On Thu, Jul 14, 2011 at 1:13 AM, vedicastrostudent wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;     Dear Narasimhaji and others,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I used to meditatively listen to/chant the Savitur Gayatri every \n&gt;&gt; morning, and on the weekends, I did a homam also (doing the Savitur \n&gt;&gt; Gayatri). Gayatri, especially in Homan seems to make things awaken in \n&gt;&gt; me, even with a tinge of sexual desire, yet still making me more \n&gt;&gt; spiritual. Separately, for the past few months, I have been having \n&gt;&gt; this heavy weight of a depressive feeling (due to several \n&gt;&gt; events/situations in my life) which just hasnt left me, and even the \n&gt;&gt; Gayatri/Homam doesnt relieve except immediately after a Homam for \n&gt;&gt; less than a day. After some reading around and doing some astrology, \n&gt;&gt; I finally arrived at a Kali mantra - Om Kreem Kalikaye namah, and I \n&gt;&gt; have started meditating on that every morning, but I still do weekend \n&gt;&gt; homams with Savitur Gayatri. But things have changed now. The Kali \n&gt;&gt; mantra is very punishing in a mental tightness kind of way, yet still \n&gt;&gt; helps me deal with mental hardship without completely giving \n&gt;&gt; up/getting angry/stressed. So I have continued it. Yet the day I do \n&gt;&gt; Savitur Gayatri homam, the Gayatri results seems a bit weaker - I \n&gt;&gt; have no idea why. Also, if I dont meditate on the Kali mantra later \n&gt;&gt; on in the same day (i.e. if I try to drop a day of doing Kali \n&gt;&gt; mantra), I get into conflicts much more easily. Is there some kind of \n&gt;&gt; conflict between the two?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sundeep\n\n"}}
