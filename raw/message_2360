Balasubramanian,\n&gt; \n&gt; One more reason for this is the fact that the=\r\n deities whom we invoke are ethereal beings and eat with their nose (smell)=\r\n. They don&#39;t eat with the mouth as we do, and they have a powerful sense of=\r\n smell and can detect the menses, which irritates them causing them to go, =\r\nwhich obviously defeats the purpose of inviting/invoking them! This is also=\r\n the reason why we were told not to smell the prasad before offering, as th=\r\nis would be akin to soiling it.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; However, it is not clear why menses=\r\n (apart from the toxicity of it you just mentioned) is treated differently =\r\nas opposed to someone who lets say travelled long distance and is sweaty an=\r\nd smelly. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks\n&gt; Narayan\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm, G Balasubramanian &lt;gbsub@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Rao,\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for provi=\r\nding this info.
