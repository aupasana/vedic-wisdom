Some people emphasize the vedantic philosophy and de-emphazie ritua=\r\nls, whereas some people are so deeply immersed in rituals.\n \n*        *    =\r\n    *\n \nThe concept &quot;I am god&quot; (aham brahmaasmi) or &quot;you are That&quot; (tattvam=\r\nasi) is very dangerous for many people. Though it is undoubtedly the ultima=\r\nte truth, half-baked understanding of this supreme truth may result in chao=\r\ns in one&#39;s spiritual life. As I keep emphasizing, all these non-dualistic (=\r\nadwaitic) concepts are applicable to one who has transcended duality. If op=\r\nposites such as pleasure and pain, life and death, heaven and hell, praise =\r\nand criticism etc are one and the same for a person and one sees the same &quot;=\r\nSelf&quot; in all those opposites, then one can say &quot;aham brahmaasmi&quot;. One who s=\r\nees these differently and finds one thing desirable and the other thing und=\r\nesirable is not yet ready to declare &quot;aham brahmaasmi&quot;. Just as one who stu=\r\ndied calculus at school but forgot it *completely* now cannot claim &quot;I know=\r\n calculus&quot;, one who sees pleasure and pain differently has forgotten one&#39;s =\r\ntrue nature and it is futile to pretend &quot;aham brahmaasmi&quot;.\n \nI can give a p=\r\narable to loosely explain this. A king forgot that he was king. His face, b=\r\nody and personality changed. His mannersims, demeanor and style of speaking=\r\n also changed. He left his palace, went to a nearby forest and started livi=\r\nng in a hut. Somebody came oneday and reminded him that he was the king. He=\r\n then said &quot;I am the king. Let me go and take control of the palace.&quot; When =\r\nhe went and tried to command the palace guards, he was not recognized and b=\r\neaten up by his own guards. As his face, behavior, mannerisms and whole per=\r\nsonality was different, he could not convince them he was the king. Instead=\r\n of directly going to the palace, he should have practiced the behavior, ma=\r\nnnerisms and style of speaking of king and then gone to the palace. Then he=\r\n stood a chance of convincing the guards that he was the king.\n \nSimilarly,=\r\n each person is god. However, until one learns (again!) how to think, act a=\r\nnd be like god, one is human. Until one learns how to look at pleasure and =\r\npain, life and death, praise and crtiticism, heaven and hell etc with an eq=\r\nual mind, one has not gotten back the characteristics needed. Until then, &quot;=\r\naham brahmaasmi&quot; is merely a theoretical statement.\n \nSomebody told me abou=\r\nt a story apparently from Sai Baba&#39;s charitra. One guru taught &quot;aham brahma=\r\nasmi&quot; to a sishya. It misled him, he became proud and started looking at gu=\r\nrus, elders and all with disrespect and with a sense of pride and self-impo=\r\nrtance. At the end of his life, he went to hell and met his guru there. He =\r\nsaid &quot;I can understand how I, with my arrogant behavior and half knowledge,=\r\n ended up here. But why are you here?&quot; The guru said &quot;for teaching tattva t=\r\no somebody not ready like you!&quot;\n \nLet the highest truths of vedanta be at t=\r\nhe back of your mind, but make sure that they do not mislead you or do dame=\r\n to your spiritual progress.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe concept &quot;I am god&quot;=\r\n is so powerful and prone to abuse. It seems like there are variations of i=\r\nt in new age spiritualism. I have seen some books that marry positive and m=\r\notivational psychology to &quot;I am god&quot; concept of vedanta and pass it off as =\r\na spiritual path and as aatma jnaana (self-knowledge). Self-realization is =\r\nnot feeling good about yourself, feeling confident about yourself and getti=\r\nng whatever you want. Supreme cosmic being (Shiva or Krishna or whatever yo=\r\nu call) is the most powerful and can get anything, because he does not want=\r\n anything.The dogma &quot;you can get whatever you want if you want it enough&quot; c=\r\nan lead to a little progress, but one will get stuck. It is very unlikely t=\r\no result in self-realization.\n \nThe goal of sadhana is to pay back previous=\r\n debts, remove the sense of I-ness in all actions, cut off desires and reac=\r\nh a state where there is no different between opposites and there is nothin=\r\ng that is desirable and nothing that is undesirable. It comes with sacrific=\r\ne and surrender and not with self-importance and self-centeredness. In an u=\r\nnprepared person, the statement &quot;I am god&quot; can induce self-importance, self=\r\n-centeredness, arrogance and false self-assurance.\n \nThough unmanifested Br=\r\nahman and manifested Brahman are the same in reality, there is a big differ=\r\nence between them in the eyes of a person who is immersed in the delusions =\r\n(opposites) of the manifested universe.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhile vedan=\r\nta is fraught with dangers for the unprepared, the path of ritualism has it=\r\ns share of pitfalls. Many people engage in rituals without understanding wh=\r\nat they are meant for. One stuck in the material world needs to engage in a=\r\nctions using the objects of material world as symbols and these symbols wil=\r\nl eventually trigger the correct thinking in the mind. There are many pries=\r\nts who do a nice pooja or homam and then feel so proud about it. Actions en=\r\ngaged by one who is not making any effort to reduce the sense of &quot;I am doin=\r\ng&quot; in those actions are fruitless. As the sense of &quot;I am doing&quot; comes down,=\r\n one&#39;s actions will have more nectar and less poison. Rituals and various a=\r\nctions engaged by many people are poisoned by the sense of &quot;I am doing&quot; and=\r\n the associated pride. If a ritual is performed with a sense of surrender, =\r\nthen the ritual works and increases the surrender further. As surrender is =\r\nincreased, ritual will become better. As ritual becomes better, surrender b=\r\necomes better. One has to gain a sufficient level of internal purity in ord=\r\ner to break through into the groove.\n \nOne not realizing this will continue=\r\n to run after the irrelevant and useless. Such a person may cleanly bathe i=\r\nn the best rivers, wear the cleanest and most beautiful clothes prescribed =\r\nin scriptures and do the rituals following each instruction carefully. But,=\r\n the strong sense of I-ness and pride may poison everything and take a long=\r\n time for the person to make progress.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThis is why =\r\nI keep emphasizing that external rituals and internal transformation should=\r\n go hand in hand. Only one will not help. Both are needed. Consciously intr=\r\nospect your thoughts and cut off pride and selfishness at their root whenev=\r\ner you encounter them in your thoughts and then take advantage of rituals w=\r\nith a sense of surrender. This combination will make one lose the false sen=\r\nse of I-ness completely and then realize the true Self.\n \nFrom &quot;somebody&quot; (=\r\nlimited sense of I-ness), most people have to first become a &quot;nobody&quot; (each=\r\n layer of that I-ness shed off) before becoming &quot;everybody&quot; (realizing the =\r\nSelf as the all-pervading spirit).\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.=\r\nnet\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jag=\r\nannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------ \n\n  ----- Original Message=\r\n ----- \n  From: Narasimha P.V.R. Rao \n  To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n =\r\n Sent: Saturday, April 18, 2009 9:07 PM\n  Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Why ritua=\r\nls?\n\n\n  Namaste,\n\n  Some intelligent and rational people wonder why we need=\r\n to do rituals. Rituals understandably seem silly to them. I want to explai=\r\nn this basic point with an analogy.\n\n  We teach some phrases and manners to=\r\n small children. For example, we tell small children to say &quot;thank you&quot; whe=\r\nn someone helps or say &quot;I am sorry&quot; when they do something wrong. A really =\r\nsmall child does not even understand what those words mean, but repeats the=\r\nm out of habit. As the child grows up, one starts to understand the true me=\r\naning of what one has been saying. In fact, an understanding of what they t=\r\nruly mean comes to one slowly as one grows. Many words are actually underst=\r\nood from experience. If a child has never seen a mango or the picture of a =\r\nmango, you cannot explain what a mango is by using hundred words. As a chil=\r\nd accumulates more and more experiences (stored perceptions of the external=\r\n world through senses), the child&#39;s thinking expands and one gets more clar=\r\nity on the words and concepts one has been exposed to. When one says sorry,=\r\n one then clearly knows what exactly that means and may even feel a certain=\r\n emotion (sadness and compassion).\n\n  Similarly, one may be doing rituals l=\r\nike homam, pooja, meditation etc with various mantras, without fully unders=\r\ntanding or appreciating what one does. One doing a ritual for many years wi=\r\nthout fully understanding its real meaning may slowly start to understand a=\r\nnd even experience some things that the rituals symbolize. Many mantras and=\r\n spiritual truths are actually understood from experience alone. One can ne=\r\nver fully understand what one has never experienced. As we accumulate more =\r\nexperiences (stored perceptions of the external and internal world through =\r\nexternal senses and the inward directed mind), one&#39;s thinking expands and o=\r\nne gets more clarity on the concepts and spiritual truths one has been expo=\r\nsed to.\n\n  Rituals in various religions are designed to symblize some truth=\r\ns that gives bliss when experienced by one. A mere explanation of the symbo=\r\nlism is often useless to give one that state of bliss. Even if you explain =\r\nto a one year old child what the word &quot;sorry&quot; means in detail, the child wi=\r\nll not understand. The best thing to do is to just get the child into the h=\r\nabit of saying &quot;I am sorry&quot; in approapriate situations. Slowly, the meaning=\r\n will become clearer and clearer with experience and the correct emotions w=\r\nill come automatically. Similarly, one chanting a mantra everyday - possibl=\r\ny with mistakes and without the correct meaning and visualization in the mi=\r\nnd - will slowly understand it and experience it.\n\n  Some religions have do=\r\nne the mistake of de-emphasizing rituals and emphasizing philosophy and the=\r\n final truths. While the latter is undeniably the end goal, the former help=\r\ns one in getting to the latter. Just as one needs to set foot at the base o=\r\nf hill before reaching its top, one often needs to engage in some external =\r\npractices in order to realize internal truths. Of course, it is good to rem=\r\nind one that reaching the top is the goal, lest one should get stuck at the=\r\n base or in the middle. But, one cannot completely eliminate the first step=\r\ns. Just saying &quot;you are That. Just realize that you are That&quot; is not an act=\r\nion plan. It does not work for most. One has to take some baby steps.\n\n  If=\r\n we don&#39;t teach a toddler to say various words because the toddler does not=\r\n anyway understand them, one will never learn anything. Correct knowledge e=\r\nvolves from half knowledge and habits that may be devoid of knowledge, as o=\r\nne experiments and experiences more. Similarly, correct spiritual knowledge=\r\n evolves from half knowledge and ritualalistic practices that may be devoid=\r\n of knowledge, as one experiments and experiences more. Most of us, when it=\r\n comes to spiritual progress, are like toddlers. So it is useful to get int=\r\no the habit of doing things. Do the rituals sincerely.\n\n  Best regards,\n  N=\r\narasimha\n  ----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--\n  Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n  Do P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n  Spirituali=\r\nty: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Free Jyotish lessons (MP3)=\r\n: http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n  Free Jyotish software (Windows): htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n  Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://ww=\r\nw.SriJagannath.org\n  ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0201_01C9C600.516B3590\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;.ygrp-photo-title {\n\tCLEAR: both; FONT-SIZE: smalle=\r\nr; OVERFLOW: hidden; WIDTH: 75px; HEIGHT: 15px; TEXT-ALIGN: center\n}\nDIV.yg=\r\nrp-photo {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-POSITION: center 50%;=\r\n BORDER-TOP: black 1px solid; BORDER-LEFT: black 1px solid; WIDTH: 62px; BO=\r\nRDER-BOTTOM: black 1px solid; BACKGROUND-REPEAT: no-repeat; HEIGHT: 62px; B=\r\nACKGROUND-COLOR: white\n}\nDIV.photo-title A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.p=\r\nhoto-title A:active {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:hover {\n\tT=\r\nEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.photo-title A:visited {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}=\r\n\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row {\n\tCLEAR: both\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.atta=\r\nch-row DIV {\n\tFLOAT: left\n}\nP {\n\tCLEAR: both; PADDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-L=\r\nEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 3px; OVERFLOW: hidden; PADDING-TOP: 15px\n}\nDIV.yg=\r\nrp-file {\n\tWIDTH: 30px; valign: middle\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row DI=\r\nV DIV A {\n\tTEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\nDIV.attach-table DIV.attach-row DIV DIV =\r\nSPAN {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: normal\n}\nDIV.ygrp-file-title {\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bold\n}\n&lt;/=\r\nSTYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso=\r\n-8859-1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3527&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;=\r\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;=\r\nNamaste,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I want to expand on some thoughts I shared=\r\n towards \nthe end of the mail.

Self-realization is=\r\n not feeling good \nabout yourself, feeling confident about yourself and get=\r\nting whatever you want. \nSupreme cosmic being (Shiva or Krishna or whatever=\r\n you call) is the most \npowerful and can get anything, because he does not =\r\n&lt;EM&gt;want &lt;/EM&gt;anything.The \ndogma &quot;you can get whatever you want if you wan=\r\nt it enough&quot; can lead to a little \nprogress, but one will get stuck. It is =\r\nvery unlikely to result in \nself-realization.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;The =\r\ngoal of sadhana is to pay back previous debts, \nremove the sense of I-ness =\r\nin all actions, cut off desires and reach a state \nwhere there is no differ=\r\nent between opposites and there is nothing that is \ndesirable and nothing t=\r\nhat is undesirable. It comes with sacrifice and surrender \nand not with sel=\r\nf-importance and self-centeredness. In an unprepared person, the \nstatement=\r\n &quot;I am god&quot; can induce self-importance, self-centeredness, arrogance \nand f=\r\nalse&nbsp;self-assurance.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Though unmanifested Brahm=\r\nan and manifested Brahman \nare the same in reality, there is a big differen=\r\nce between them in the eyes of a \nperson who is immersed in the delusions (=\r\nopposites) of the manifested \nuniverse.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;While vedanta is fraught with dangers for the =\r\n\nunprepared, the path of ritualism has its share of pitfalls. Many people e=\r\nngage \nin rituals without understanding what they are meant for. One stuck =\r\nin the \nmaterial world needs to engage in actions using the objects of mate=\r\nrial world as \nsymbols and these symbols will eventually trigger the correc=\r\nt thinking in the \nmind. There are many priests who do a nice pooja or homa=\r\nm and then feel so proud \nabout it. Actions engaged by one who is not makin=\r\ng any effort to reduce the \nsense of &quot;I am doing&quot; in those actions are frui=\r\ntless. As the sense of &quot;I am \ndoing&quot; comes down, one&#39;s actions will have mo=\r\nre nectar and less poison. Rituals \nand various actions engaged by many peo=\r\nple are poisoned by the sense of &quot;I am \ndoing&quot; and the associated pride. If=\r\n a ritual is performed with a sense of \nsurrender, then the ritual works an=\r\nd increases the surrender further.&nbsp;As \nsurrender is increased, ritual =\r\nwill become better. As ritual becomes better, \nsurrender becomes better. On=\r\ne has to gain a sufficient level of internal purity \nin order to break thro=\r\nugh into the groove.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;One not realizing this will co=\r\nntinue to run after \nthe irrelevant and useless. Such a person may cleanly =\r\nbathe in the best rivers, \nwear the cleanest and most beautiful clothes pre=\r\nscribed in scriptures and do the \nrituals following each instruction carefu=\r\nlly. But, the strong sense of I-ness \nand pride may poison everything and t=\r\nake a long time for the person to make \nprogress.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;This is why I keep emphasizing that =\r\nexternal \nrituals and internal transformation should go hand in hand.

For example, we tel=\r\nl small children to say &quot;thank you&quot; when someone \n  helps or say &quot;I am sorr=\r\ny&quot; when they do something wrong. A really small child \n  does not even unde=\r\nrstand what those words mean, but repeats them out of habit. \n  As the chil=\r\nd grows up, one starts to understand the true meaning of what one \n  has be=\r\nen saying. In fact, an understanding of what they truly mean comes to \n  on=\r\ne slowly as one grows. Many words are actually understood from experience. =\r\n\n  If a child has never seen a mango or the picture of a mango, you cannot =\r\n\n  explain what a mango is by using hundred words. As a child accumulates m=\r\nore \n  and more experiences (stored perceptions of the external world throu=\r\ngh \n  senses), the child&#39;s thinking expands and one gets more clarity on th=\r\ne words \n  and concepts one has been exposed to. When one says sorry, one t=\r\nhen clearly \n  knows what exactly that means and may even feel a certain em=\r\notion (sadness and \n  compassion).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial s=\r\nize=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Similarly, o=\r\nne may be doing rituals like homam, \n  pooja, meditation etc with various m=\r\nantras, without fully understanding or \n  appreciating what one does.&nbsp;=\r\nOne doing a ritual for many years without \n  fully understanding its real m=\r\neaning may slowly start to understand and even \n  experience some things th=\r\nat the rituals symbolize. Many mantras and spiritual \n  truths are actually=\r\n understood from experience alone. One can never \n  fully&nbsp;understand w=\r\nhat one has never experienced. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \n  size=3D2&gt;As we =\r\naccumulate more experiences (stored perceptions of the external \n  and inte=\r\nrnal world through external senses and the inward directed mind), \n  one&#39;s =\r\nthinking expands and one gets more clarity on the concepts and spiritual \n =\r\n truths one has been exposed to.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Rituals in var=\r\nious religions are designed to \n  symblize some truths that gives bliss whe=\r\nn experienced by one. A mere \n  explanation of the symbolism is often usele=\r\nss to give one that state of bliss. \n  Even if you explain to a one year ol=\r\nd child what the word &quot;sorry&quot; means in \n  detail, the child will not unders=\r\ntand. The best thing to do is to just get the \n  child into the habit of sa=\r\nying &quot;I am sorry&quot; in approapriate situations. \n  Slowly, the meaning will b=\r\necome clearer and clearer with experience&nbsp;and \n  the correct emotions =\r\nwill come automatically. Similarly, one chanting a mantra \n  everyday - pos=\r\nsibly with mistakes and without the correct meaning and \n  visualization in=\r\n the mind - will slowly understand it and experience \n  it.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  =\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAr=\r\nial size=3D2&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Some religions have done t=\r\nhe mistake of \n  de-emphasizing rituals and emphasizing philosophy and the =\r\nfinal truths. While \n  the latter is undeniably the end goal, the former he=\r\nlps one in getting to the \n  latter. Just as one needs to set foot at the b=\r\nase of hill before reaching its \n  top, one often needs to engage in some e=\r\nxternal practices in order to realize \n  internal truths. Of course, it is =\r\ngood to remind one that reaching the top is \n  the goal, lest one should ge=\r\nt stuck at the base or in the middle. But, one \n  cannot completely elimina=\r\nte the first steps. Just saying &quot;you are That. Just \n  realize that you are=\r\n That&quot; is not an action plan.
