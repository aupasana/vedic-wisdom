I believed in god all along, did my\n&gt; japam etc. why did i \n&gt; fall prey to these people? \n&gt; \n&gt; i realize now that after many years, these people\n&gt; are ignorant. I \n&gt; wanted to say &#39;ignorant fools&#39; but there are some\n&gt; elders involved \n&gt; here.\n&gt; \n&gt; i can assume this as karma phala, but the past is\n&gt; hindering me. there \n&gt; is so much pent up anger, that i want to go back and\n&gt; kick these \n&gt; people who have mis guided me.\n&gt; \n&gt; how do I forigve these people and forget? even gita,\n&gt; or homam etc are \n&gt; not any reprive. the soul is frustrated ... what\n&gt; does god get out of \n&gt; this drama?\n&gt; \n&gt; any thoughts, wise men and women?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n\n\n"}}
