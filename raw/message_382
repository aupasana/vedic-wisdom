Then he got \nwhat needed from his guru in just a few days. Getting the right guru can \nchange one&#39;s spiritual trajectory for ever.\n\nSome people say, &quot;whoever is your guru, just follow that guru blindly and \nyou will achieve&quot;. That is partly true. But, a moth that clings on to a rock \nand does not leave it can be crushed when the rock falls from the mountain. \nHowever, one who has blind faith in guru and follows guru completely is \natleast pushing the ownership of several karmas to guru and keeping own \naccount clean. That surrender is a smart (but difficult) thing and actually \nthe first step towards an unconditional surrender to god.\n\nIt is good to surrender to a guru and follow with blind faith. But the \nreward for that attitude is maximized if guru is a capable one instead of a \nfake one.\n\nGood gurus first test the sishyas and push them to the breakage point and \ntest the limits. Good gurus are rare these days.\n\nJust as a guru tests sishya, a sishya can also test guru until one is fully \nsatisfied. But, once one accepts a person as one&#39;s guru, one should be \nfaithful and obedient. People like Vivekananda and some fellow disciples of \nRamakrishna Paramahamsa tested their guru for an extended period of time. \nVivekananda tested his guru almost till the end. But then, those are special \nplays of special souls. But, a good guru should not be angry or upset if an \nintelligent sishya questions or tests.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThough many people go searching for a guru, it is not necessary. A good guru \nwill find the sishyas he/she is supposed to guide and approach them. Or \natleast a good guru should know how to make the sishya come to him/her.\n\n*        *        *\n\nFor some people, a guru may have already entered their life and started \ninfluencing them and yet they may not know it! Guru does not necessarily \nmean one who sits on a high pedestal with you sitting at his feet and \nteaching you things. Guru does not mean one with certain robes or certain \nhair etc. Guru does not mean one with a &quot;Swami&quot; prefix in the name. Guru \ndoes not mean one who has a certain age or a certain look. Guru is one who \nremoves darkness within you. A person you have never met consciously may \nhave decided to influence your thinking and slowly remove your darkness from \na distance. You may never meet and the person may have transformed.\n\nA guru who is unable to transform you is worthless. A guru&#39;s job is to \ntransform a person. Similarly, a sadhana you are doing that is unable to \ntransform you in some way or the other is useless. The goal of all sadhana \nis to transform yourself.\n\n*        *        *\n\nOn a *personal note*, I did not realize it when I was approached by my \nspiritual guru. I was actually quite put off by him. I thought he was a \nwacko - a crazy man - talking about useless and impure things. He would talk \nabout tantra, aghora, Kaali, Taaraa, shakti chalana, kundalini, darshana of \ndevatas and stuff like that. He sent me a rudraksha mala he specially made \nfor me and asked me to use it to meditate on Gayatri mantra 216 times a day. \nThe only rules were to stay as still as I could, with an erect back and \nclosed eyes and not let any strange experiences or visions distract me and \nkeep the focus on the mantra. The other rule was brahmacharya. I did nothing \nabout it for a long time. He would patiently call me now and then and chat \nabout various things related to spirituality. Though I did not like him at \nfirst, I slowly started realizing his purity and simplicity. He never put \nany pressure and let things take their course.\n\nAbout one year from the time he contacted me first, on a Vaisakha Pournima \nday, after my monthly Full Moon Satya Narayana vratam, I suddenly got the \ninspiration that I should follow his advice. He may be a tantrika, a Kaali \nworshipper, a corrupt soul and what not (yes, that is how I thought then!), \nbut all he asked me to do was Gayatri mantra, a veda mantra, with a \nRudraksha maalaa and keep brahmacharya. What he asked me seemed &quot;saattwik \nenough&quot;. So I decided in an impulse and started. Some things happened. After \n18 days, something dramatic happened that changed my thinking and life \ncompletely. Abstract concepts and bookish knowledge are one thing and direct \nexperience is another. It is ok to harp on the transientness of the \nso-called &quot;concrete&quot; reality that our senses keep perceiving and hypothesize \nthat there is a far higher reality that one can merge one&#39;s consciousness \nin, but one&#39;s conviction - especially that of a highly logical person like \nme - will not be complete until one actually sees it. In fact, one&#39;s \nconviction will be quite shaky until then.\n\nEven after this, my ego was still there. I was a young achiever. I had BA \ndegrees in Sanskrit at the age of 10 and wrote metred poetry in Sanskrit \nlike ancients, at 11. I was a highly intelligent young achiever with a lot \nof pride over my intelligence and scholarship. Thus, accepting one who was 6 \nmonths younger and one whose Sanskrit knowledge and Sanskrit pronunciation \nseemed quite inferior to mine as my guru was too much. As if sensing it, the \nfirst thing he told me when we met face to face a few months later was: &quot;I \nam not your guru. Never be under the illusion that I am your guru. We are \nsishyas of the same guru and our guru is not here now. I started first in \nthis life and hence I am guiding you. I will do whatever I can for you, but \nI am not your guru&quot;. I was &quot;relieved&quot;.\n\nSlowly, the change triggered earlier started accelerating. My mind became \nclearer about what is what. When I saw myself as a completely transformed \nperson with much clearer vision and realized that the change was brought by \nManish, I told him that I now thought of him as my guru. He said fine. \nBasically, he had accepted me as a sishya long back and waited till I \naccepted him as my guru (though he kept playing that role even without my \nacceptance). Basically, the names used for the relationship did not matter \nto him and he did what thought he needed to do. Simple.\n\nLater, the homam movement started. I started doing homam everyday. I \nexperimented with many and settled down on daily Chandi homam. Once I looked \nat Manish with suspicion because he was a Kaali worshipper. Now, I was doing \nChandi homam myself! I saw my prejudices for what they were. I became very \nclear in my mind about so many things. Many things that seemed conflicting \nand contradictory fell in place smoothly now. Some of that clarity of \nknowledge translates into my writings, but some of it is difficult to \ntranslate into the physical plane.\n\nWhat a good guru does is precisely this - to transform you from something to \nsomething else, preferably something better!\n\n*        *        *\n\nIf you want to find the right guru who can make this human life worthwhile, \nyou should not be in a hurry at all. Be patient and keep praying. While you \nwait, you can use whatever knowledge, teachings and tools are available to \npurify and transform yourself and remove some of the darkness yourself. In \nthe process, you may end up finding your guru!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n&gt; Dear Jitendra,\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;there too much strenghth is given on Guru\n&gt;&gt;but somebody please tell me what one should do\n&gt;&gt;if he doesn;t have a Guru\n&gt;\n&gt; My opinion for the crucial question you asked - one need not worry,\n&gt; need not despair, need not feel dejected if one don&#39;t have Guru. one\n&gt; must not be in any hurry to make Guru. one needs to commit one&#39;s\n&gt; self to spiritual Sadhana. sincerely, dedicatedly. crux of the\n&gt; matter is to purify one&#39;s heart. to calm one&#39;s mind. Chitta Shudhhi\n&gt; must be done. GURU will come to You when you are ready.\n&gt;\n&gt; that is my conviction. When i am ready, my guru will come and even\n&gt; if some physical entity as Guru never comes, i am not doomed.it\n&gt; won&#39;t stop me from getting the realisation of the self.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@...&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste to all\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; i loved the article on Importance of brahamcharya\n&gt;&gt; and similarly i loved these topics in book AGHORA\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; but i have one serious question\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; there too much strenghth is given on Guru\n&gt;&gt; but somebody please tell me what one should do\n&gt;&gt; if he doesn;t have a Guru\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Ok i may not have done some good work in my past life\n&gt;&gt; that i should a guru quickly\n&gt;&gt; bcoz untill i don&#39;t become pure no Guru would accept me\n&gt;&gt; and untill i get a guru, i ll never become pure\n&gt;&gt; so.its a vicious circle\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and when i hear be patient you ll find your Guru when time will\n&gt;&gt; come i wonder if chang dev maharaj had to wait for so many\n&gt;&gt; years to get his guru and though he was a capable person\n&gt;&gt; who could live for so many years evading death(i think 1400 years)\n&gt;&gt;  what if i forget about spirituality in the next\n&gt;&gt; 10-15 years(or something wierd happens to my thinking style),\n&gt;&gt;  leave about forgetting it in next births\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and i m not an advanced Jyotishi and\n&gt;&gt; i have no confidence on my calculations\n&gt;&gt; and i cant find out my ishta devata\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; so in the end its too confusing\n&gt;&gt; (may be that MOTHER wants me too struggle at present)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; but yes i liked th line written by narsimha ji\n&gt;&gt; &quot;&quot;If there is one good thing to use free will for, spiritual\n&gt;&gt; progress is definitely *the* thing. One should push one&#39;s free will\n&gt;&gt; to the extreme when it comes to spiritual progress. It is worth\n&gt; it!&quot;&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; So, bearing with my confusions please ignore it\n&gt;&gt; if you find it disturbing\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; regards\n&gt;&gt; jitender\n\n\n"}}
