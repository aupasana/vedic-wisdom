The mother=\r\n board supporting the crux of computing, any daughter cards for specific al=\r\ngorithms, I/O controllers and I/O cables, power supply circuitry and finall=\r\ny the mechanical parts (e.g. chassis, hard disk, USB ports etc).\n \nThe kosh=\r\nas are analogous to this. Aanandamaya kosha is like a motherboard containin=\r\ng CPU, memory etc, vijnaanamaya kosha is like a daughtercard for algorithms=\r\n, manomaya kosha is like I/O cntrollers and I/O cables, praanamaya kosha is=\r\n like power supply circuitry and annamaya kosha is like the mechanical part=\r\ns.\n \nNow, a computer may be operating in many modes. It may be running full=\r\n blast reading a huge video file from the network, storing to an external U=\r\nSB drive and also showing video on the screen. Or it may be running in mode=\r\ns with several levels of power saving, with some activities limited based o=\r\nn the power saving level. Or it may be in a power standby. Depending on the=\r\n power saving mode, the functionality and workload of each of the above lay=\r\ners may change. But, a computer in a power save mode may still be checking =\r\nthe network or USB drive or key board or mouse and using the power supply c=\r\nircuitry.\n \nSimilarly, all the koshas are performing various functions norm=\r\nally. They are all busy with a lot of activity. As Kundalini rises through =\r\nchakras, the activity may come down. But various koshas continue to functio=\r\nn, albeit at a lower (or atleast altered) level of activity.\n \n*        *  =\r\n      *\n \nKoshas are a breakdown of individualized consciousness based on f=\r\nunctionality. Different parts of individualized consciousness play differen=\r\nt roles to keep the individualization going.\n \nChakras are realms of awaren=\r\ness that consciousness can be in. As consciousness rises from one realm of =\r\nawareness to another, activities of various koshas within the respective fu=\r\nnctionality areas comes down. The koshas are layers that work together. You=\r\n cannot stop one layer and then stop another. You have to slow down all lay=\r\ners together, but the exact mechanism and impact of slowdown changes from l=\r\nayer to layer. So you keep slowing them down together, in steps.\n \nBest reg=\r\nards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo =\r\nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): h=\r\nttp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyot=\r\nishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org=\r\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- I=\r\nn vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji,\n&gt; \n&gt; What is your opinion on this: Clearly Ad=\r\ni Sankara&#39;s Vivekacudamani does two broad levels of classification (a) the =\r\nmaterial level of classification, in which he quantifies materiality in its=\r\n various levels of manifestation - karana sarira (gunas), linga sarira (tat=\r\ntwas) and sthoola sarira (mahabhutas) (b) the realization level of classifi=\r\ncation - annamayakosa, pranamayakosa, manomayakosa, vijnanamayakosa, and an=\r\nandamayakosa. There has to be a reason why he defined the realization level=\r\ns of classification into 5, right? Consequently, the &quot;rising of kundalini&quot; =\r\nmust also give at some level of classification the same set of realizations=\r\n, no? It would seem at least superficially to fit on the 5 lower chakras. F=\r\nrom that point of view, the 6th chakra would be after the anandamayakosa. C=\r\nlearly the anandamayakosa would be the final level of egoity, since by bein=\r\ng released from it would leave one out of the linga sarira, but yet possibl=\r\ny still in the karana sarira (gunas level). It would seem that any realizat=\r\nion levels after getting into the karana sarira would be ahamkara free (and=\r\n of course tattwa free), yet guna bound. Final releas from gunas of course =\r\nwould lead to pure awakening of Brahman.\n&gt; \n&gt; The point above is - if the m=\r\nayakosas are not related to the kundalini chakras, what are they?

It seems to be his extrapolation=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What you quoted from Taittariya Upanishad is the tradit=\r\nional view that I am familiar with. Other scriptures refer to the same orde=\r\nr of creation, including &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot;, where Maharshi Vasishtha teach=\r\nes creation, destruction and liberation to Lord Rama.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *  =\r\n      *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This Upanishadic understanding is also c=\r\nonsistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The five chakras downw=\r\nards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent ether, air, fire=\r\n, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, earth element within=\r\n one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are effaced in one&#39;s =\r\nself-awareness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, water element within=\r\n one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of water element are effaced in one&#39;s =\r\nself-awareness. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By earth and water etc, don&#39;t =\r\njust think of physical earth and physical water etc. Earth element shows a =\r\nsolid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible and fluid state of=\r\n existence. For example, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a=\r\n car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid state and made of ea=\r\nrth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a particular thing (e.g. a car, a hou=\r\nse, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of water element. Thus, di=\r\nfferent mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the five elements.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thinks of a body that look=\r\ns and feels in a particular way physically. Apart from the physical aspect,=\r\n one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has certain qualities, certain needs, =\r\ncertain belongings etc. All those concepts one has about who one is, form o=\r\nne&#39;s self-awareness and Kundalini represents that self-awareness. Kundalini=\r\n cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* in nature =\r\nwithin one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. Kundalini ca=\r\nnnot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anything* that is *solid* or *fluid*=\r\n in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still remaining. A=\r\nnd so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many people who talk about experiences of Kunda=\r\nlini in higher chakras are often talking merely about some amount of vaayus=\r\n flowing in those chakras (which may still be a nice experience) and have *=\r\nnot* experienced Kundalini actually being there. IF Kundalini really leaves=\r\n Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body, one will not have notion=\r\ns of owning anything. Similarly, as Kundalini moves up each chakra, each el=\r\nement is effaced in one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is, at the physical as=\r\n well as the subtle level of existence! To completely efface even one eleme=\r\nnt (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), even for a short duration of ti=\r\nme, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The order in which elements are e=\r\nffaced as one progresses towards samadhi is - earth, water, fire, air and e=\r\nther. If Kundalini again comes down, effaced elements return to work in the=\r\n reverse order - ether, air, fire, water and earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *    =\r\n    *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding physics and spiritual realities:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does physics describe reality?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physi=\r\ncs tries to describe/model reality at the gross physical level, as perceive=\r\nd by the external senses. However, one&#39;s mind can &quot;perceive&quot; things without=\r\n the external senses playing a role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a simple example,=\r\n one may be asleep and get a dream, in which one&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; some peop=\r\nle and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between them. In another example, a yogi may b=\r\ne meditating with a mantra with intense focus and &quot;see&quot; some scenes and/or =\r\n&quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot be perceived by the external senses=\r\n and hence cannot be studied by modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is rea=\r\nsonable to define reality as something that can be perceived by the externa=\r\nl senses, because different people can experience the same reality using th=\r\neir senses individually and verify the observation. However, some experienc=\r\nes of the mind that cannot be perceived by senses are sometimes very powerf=\r\nul and have a huge, life-altering and sometimes liberating influence on peo=\r\nple. Inability to study and model them is a big drawback of modern science.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One may categorize=\r\n dreams and internal yogic experiences as imaginations or hallucinations, b=\r\necause there is no independent validation, and call them unworthy of a stud=\r\ny. But there are cases that make one wonder. For example, see the following=\r\n messages from the archives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Mystical experiences of mind=\r\n and mantras (message 951)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisd=\r\nom/message/951\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, one person had a spe=\r\ncific yogic experience that was described in detail and another person seem=\r\ned to know about it and supplied one tangible detail relating to the experi=\r\nence, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first person,=\r\n though it was beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Re: Guru (message 391)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdo=\r\nm/message/391\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message also, one person had a=\r\n specific yogic experience that was described in detail and another person =\r\nseemed to know about it and supplied a couple of tangible details relating =\r\nto the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the =\r\nfirst person, though it was beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Internal god and external god (message 2498)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/2498\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the =\r\nabove message, one person had a specific yogic experience involving a deity=\r\n and another person perceived with his external senses a vision involving t=\r\nhe same deity, though others in the room could not perceive anything with t=\r\nheir external senses, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the expe=\r\nrience of the first person through a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *   =\r\n     *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such examples cannot prove much, but they=\r\n do suggest that perhaps *some* experiences that cannot be measured or perc=\r\neived by the external senses are observable by others, though not everyone =\r\nmay be able to observe. Then, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some*=\r\n experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by the external senses be=\r\ning a part of the &quot;reality&quot; that mind can access.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, ho=\r\nw can modern science study it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because the only thing tha=\r\nt can be studied and measured is the reality involving the gross body and i=\r\nts senses, one may suggest that experiences of the subtle body may be studi=\r\ned by observing various parts of the gross physical body. For example, one =\r\ncan look at the nervous signals flowing through various parts of the brain =\r\nand try to correlate them with the experiences of the subtle body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On the surface, it sounds like a great idea. But, it assumes that=\r\n subtle body and causal body are redundant. Though there is some correspond=\r\nence between what happens in the causal, subtle and gross bodies, it is a m=\r\nany-to-many mapping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in which case the concept=\r\n of causal and subtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. whatever they model c=\r\nan be moderled using just the gross body!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you drive th=\r\nrough a neighborhood and observe the houses from the road, you can have *so=\r\nme* idea of what is going on. A particular house with a lot of lights and s=\r\nound and many cars parked outside may be having a party. People in one part=\r\nicular house with no lights are probably out of town. But you can never be =\r\nsure what is going on in the house, how many people are inside, what exactl=\r\ny they are doing etc, by merely looking at the house from outside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, by looking at the nervous signals in various points of=\r\n the brain, you may be able to see some basic things, but not much. The exp=\r\neriences of the subtle mind are beyond your reach and study, if your tools =\r\nare limited to the gross physical domain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *        *     =\r\n   *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern science cannot study that part=\r\n of the reality which is beyond the scope of external senses, unless scient=\r\nists become yogis and develop mastery of the internal world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; While rishis of ancient times had mastery of the internal world (which =\r\nis the microcosm of the entire universe) and could observe any space-time p=\r\noint, even the greatest yogis of today cannot control their state completel=\r\ny. When Kundalini rises, it may go somewhere and one may experience some pa=\r\nrt of the Infinite Reality. But one cannot control exactly where Kundalini =\r\ngoes and exactly which part of the Infinite Reality one observes. Rishis se=\r\nemed to have a perfect control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nar=\r\nasimha\n\n\n"}}
