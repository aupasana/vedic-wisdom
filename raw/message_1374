Money is no problem when Jagdamba =\r\nis with me. I will be happy to be the instrument in this great devine missi=\r\non. First I will start this at the place near Dwarka. This is the extreme w=\r\nest coast of India. I have stayed there for 7 years and good contacts are t=\r\nhere. It may be at Okha port or Near Harsiddhi temple near Dwarka or near G=\r\nopnath (?) one of the Dwadash Jyotirlingam near Dwarka. You just pray for m=\r\ne and also tell Manishji also to bless me so that I can succeed.

There need not be a big=\r\n or famous temple nearby. Buy a few acres of land (for possible expansion i=\r\nn future) and construct a homa kundam built in open space with four pillars=\r\n on the four sides and a high roof on the top to protect from rain. The are=\r\na is open on all the four sides and covered only on the top. Close to it, a=\r\n small one or two room structure is built to store materials.\n\n          A =\r\npriest or a sadhaka is employed. His main qualification is that he should b=\r\ne a sincere devotee of the Mother and interested in a simple lifestyle dedi=\r\ncated to Her. His job is to do one Chandi homam in the morning, one more in=\r\n forenoon, have lunch, relax in the afternoon and do one more Chandi homam =\r\nin the evening. Keep doing it day in and day out. There are no idols to wor=\r\nship and no other rituals to do.\n\n          This will pretty much take up a=\r\nll his time and hence enough money should be arranged to take care of the p=\r\nriest and his family. If the priest is not well-versed in homam or Chandi h=\r\nomam, that is no problem. He can be trained. But, the most important thing =\r\nis that he should be committed to this and devoted to the Mother. If one ha=\r\ns the basic simplicity, innocence, devotion and purity, other things will f=\r\nall in place by themselves.\n\n          Buying of the land and construction =\r\nof room and homa kundam (with roof and pillars) is a one-time expense. Sala=\r\nry of the priest and materials like ghee, wood etc for homam are an ongoing=\r\n expense. This project requires a good amount of money and energy.\n\n       =\r\n   *        *        *\n\n          After a center is established and sadhana=\r\n progresses in each center, slowly the presence of Mother will be establish=\r\ned there. Once that happens, the sadhaka will start making faster progress.=\r\n As he becomes purer and purere, the sadhana will generate more and more en=\r\nergy.\n\n          After establishing 4 other centers, a center in Ujjain is =\r\nto be started. The sadhana being done at the Chandi homam centers will have=\r\n a catalytic influence on the homam movement and many many people will star=\r\nt doing different kinds of homas around the world. This will have a major i=\r\nmpact on dharma in the world. That is what he was told.\n\n          *       =\r\n *        *\n\n          I did not want to force or impose on anybody. So thi=\r\ns has waited. When the time comes, people who will make this happen will co=\r\nme and take charge.\n\n          Time has probably not yet come for Ujjain. B=\r\nut if there is a village in Gujarat or Maharashtra where you can do this, p=\r\nlease consider. But please realize that this requires money commitment and =\r\nalso a committed sadhaka.\n\n          Best regards,\n          Narasimha\n    =\r\n      ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n---\n          Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ h=\r\nomam\n          Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/=\r\n tarpana\n          Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wis=\r\ndom\n          Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. =\r\nnet\n          Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.=\r\norg\n          Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.=\r\norg\n          ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- \n\n            ----- Original Message ----- \n            From: A=\r\nshwin Rawal \n            To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n            Se=\r\nnt: Thursday, February 26, 2009 12:50 PM\n            Subject: Re: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] Re: Shree Maa (Re: Question on Kunjika Stotra)\n\n\n                  De=\r\nar Sir,\n                  Should I try at Ujjain ?

This \n                       =\r\n         is similar to what my guru was told by Divine Mother when she appe=\r\nared to \n                                him during Shata Chandi homam at C=\r\nhennai.\n\n                                She told him that many people are =\r\nand will be born who will perform a short \n                                =\r\nfire ritual on a regular basis, establish sanatana dharma and peace in the =\r\n\n                                world and also make quick spiritual progre=\r\nss individually in that process. \n                                Shree Maa=\r\n&#39;s statement about what Ramakrishna told her is along similar \n            =\r\n                    lines.\n\n                                My guru was als=\r\no told by Mother that a few centres of regular Chandi homam \n              =\r\n                  should be established around the world, where Chandi homa=\r\nm is done 3 times a \n                                day. These places do n=\r\not need to be near any temples or famous places and \n                      =\r\n          can be anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For example, t=\r\nhere is no \n                                need to offer silk sarees etc i=\r\nn fire. A simple ritual with bare minimum \n                                =\r\nofferings is enough, but it needs to be performed 3 times everyday. When a =\r\n\n                                few such centres are established, it will =\r\napparently lead to a chain of \n                                events that =\r\nwill help re-establish sanatana dharma.\n\n                                Th=\r\nough not 3 times a day, these people have done a Chandi homam everyday for =\r\n\n                                3 years in the same place and finished 100=\r\n0 such homas. That is fantastic! \n                                It is the=\r\n sadhana and purity of sadhakas that creates energy and brings \n           =\r\n                     deities to a place. While several ancient temples are =\r\nwithout any divine \n                                presence these days, ne=\r\nw places of divine presence may be created by pure \n                       =\r\n         souls engaged in selfless sadhana for establishing dharma in the w=\r\norld.\n\n                                As I mentioned earlier, the sankalpa=\r\n of the Shata Chandi homam during which \n                                Mo=\r\nther appeared and gave instructions to my guru on spreading homam was \n    =\r\n                            taken on Ramakrishna&#39; s birth anniversary and t=\r\nhe time of sankalpa was within \n                                a few minut=\r\nes from the actual Tithi Pravesha time of the birth anniversary. \n         =\r\n                       All of this was a coincidence and we were unaware of=\r\n this significance when \n                                we decided the muh=\r\nurta. It is interesting to know that Ramakrishna did \n                     =\r\n           mention fire ceremonies specifically to somebody and that his wo=\r\nrds are \n                                similar to the words of Mother.\n\n =\r\n                               Best regards,\n                              =\r\n  Narasimha\n                                ------------ --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- -\n                                Do a Shor=\r\nt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n                  =\r\n              Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ =\r\ntarpana\n                                Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.=\r\ncom/ group/vedic- wisdom\n                                Free Jyotish lesso=\r\nns (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n                            =\r\n    Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n      =\r\n                          Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.Sr=\r\niJagan nath.org\n                                ------------ --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- - \n\n                                &gt;

This &lt;BR&gt;is =\r\nsimilar \n                                to what my guru was told by Divine=\r\n Mother when \n                                she appeared to &lt;BR&gt;him durin=\r\ng Shata Chandi \n                                homam at Chennai.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sh=\r\ne told him that many \n                                people are and will b=\r\ne born who will perform a \n                                short &lt;BR&gt;fire r=\r\nitual on a regular basis, \n                                establish sanata=\r\nna dharma and peace in the \n                                &lt;BR&gt;world and a=\r\nlso make quick spiritual progress \n                                individu=\r\nally in that process. &lt;BR&gt;Shree Maa&#39;s \n                                stat=\r\nement about what Ramakrishna told her is \n                                a=\r\nlong similar &lt;BR&gt;lines.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My guru was also \n                          =\r\n      told by Mother that a few centres of regular \n                       =\r\n         Chandi homam &lt;BR&gt;should be established around \n                   =\r\n             the world, where Chandi homam is done 3 times a \n             =\r\n                   &lt;BR&gt;day. These places do not need to be near any \n      =\r\n                          temples or famous places and &lt;BR&gt;can be \n        =\r\n                        anywhere. The ritual need not be elaborate. For \n  =\r\n                              example, there is no &lt;BR&gt;need to offer silk \n=\r\n                                sarees etc in fire. A simple ritual with ba=\r\nre \n                                minimum &lt;BR&gt;offerings is enough, but it=\r\n needs to \n                                be performed 3 times everyday. W=\r\nhen a &lt;BR&gt;few \n                                such centres are established=\r\n, it will apparently \n                                lead to a chain of &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;events that will help \n                                re-establish sanat=\r\nana dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though not \n                                3 times a da=\r\ny, these people have done a Chandi \n                                homam e=\r\nveryday for &lt;BR&gt;3 years in the same place \n                                =\r\nand finished 1000 such homas. That is fantastic! \n                         =\r\n       &lt;BR&gt;It is the sadhana and purity of sadhakas \n                      =\r\n          that creates energy and brings &lt;BR&gt;deities to a \n                =\r\n                place. While several ancient temples are without \n         =\r\n                       any divine &lt;BR&gt;presence these days, new places \n    =\r\n                            of divine presence may be created by pure \n    =\r\n                            &lt;BR&gt;souls engaged in selfless sadhana for \n    =\r\n                            establishing dharma in the world.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As I \n=\r\n                                mentioned earlier, the sankalpa of the Shat=\r\na \n                                Chandi homam during which &lt;BR&gt;Mother app=\r\neared \n                                and gave instructions to my guru on =\r\nspreading \n                                homam was &lt;BR&gt;taken on Ramakrish=\r\nna&#39; s birth \n                                anniversary and the time of sa=\r\nnkalpa was within \n                                &lt;BR&gt;a few minutes from t=\r\nhe actual Tithi Pravesha \n                                time of the birth=\r\n anniversary. &lt;BR&gt;All of this \n                                was a coinci=\r\ndence and we were unaware of this \n                                signific=\r\nance when &lt;BR&gt;we decided the muhurta. It \n                                i=\r\ns interesting to know that Ramakrishna did \n                               =\r\n &lt;BR&gt;mention fire ceremonies specifically to \n                             =\r\n   somebody and that his words are &lt;BR&gt;similar to \n                        =\r\n        the words of Mother.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best \n                                r=\r\negards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- \n                           =\r\n     --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do \n                     =\r\n           a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A \n                                href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot;
