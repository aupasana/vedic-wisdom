It has to start wit=\r\nh Om\n&gt; 2. In addition it can have a &#39;bijakshar&#39; such as G^n. \n&gt; \n&gt; Hence th=\r\ne mantra is \n&gt; 1. &quot;Om G^n Ganapataye Nama:&quot;\n&gt; 2. &quot;Om Nama: Shivaay&quot; (Bijaks=\r\nhar is not needed. In Sanskrit verb can come anywhere.)\n&gt; 3. &quot;Om Vishnave N=\r\nama:&quot;\n&gt; 4. &quot;Om Devyei Nama:&quot; Or &quot;Om Namo Devyei Mahadevyei Shivayei Satatam=\r\n Nama:&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The importance of Mantra is in Sadhana. Every Mantra needs to =\r\nbe made Siddha. There are methods for doing this. The examples are well kno=\r\nwn. Story says that, Devarshi Narad gave mantra to Valya Koli - &quot;Mara&quot; and =\r\nasked him to repeat it continuously. You know the rest of the story.\n&gt; \n&gt; T=\r\nhe simple method to make a mantra siddha is to repeat it daily for a commit=\r\nted number of times with full dedication to the meaning of each syllable of=\r\n the mantra. The effect is seen gradually but definitely.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sorry, =\r\nI always found it difficult to set the pronounciations right for a non Indi=\r\nan language speaking person. Sometimes even it is difficult to explain it t=\r\no an Indian language speaking person. For example - In &quot;Shivaay Nama:&quot; and =\r\n&quot;Nama: Shivaay&quot;, there is a subtle difference in the pronounciation of &quot;Nam=\r\na:&quot;. In the first one &quot;ha&quot; of the visarga &quot;:&quot; is to be pronounced completel=\r\ny while in the second one it is to be pronounced like a swar &quot;:&quot; (no &quot;ha&quot;).=\r\n Now you can understand why I say that it is difficult to explain.\n&gt; \n&gt; reg=\r\nards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Jagmohan\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;gigarm2003&quot; =\r\n&lt;gigarm2003@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; From your answers seams that &quot;yei&quot; or &quot;ye&quot; has=\r\n not to do with kundalini shakti...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Please tell me if it&#39;s right o=\r\nr not..\n&gt; &gt; One more thing.\n&gt; &gt; Could you please suggest me a sure referenc=\r\ne, accessible for someone who speaks only english (don&#39;t understand sanskri=\r\nt..)  to learn more about this Sacred knowledge of Mantras (books or maybe =\r\na teacher to get in touch), according to the vedic tradition.\n&gt; &gt; In the We=\r\nst certain knowledge is given from people claiming they have been the pupil=\r\n of a certain guru or they studied in India for several years and so on.
