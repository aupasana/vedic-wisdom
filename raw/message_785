Narasimha is one of the right persons capable of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; guiding you. If you are sincere, you&#39;ll be helped. although, i \nwrite\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n much now a days, i am just like anybody else, struggeling !!!\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a =\r\nbeggar like others. But I try to help other beggars by \nshowing the \n&gt; hous=\r\nes where they can try their luck by begging.\n&gt; \n&gt; Normally, one beggar may =\r\nview another beggar as a competitor and \nnot like \n&gt; too many people to beg=\r\n in the same area. However, this begging is \ndifferent \n&gt; and there is no c=\r\nompetition between different beggars. The owner \nof the \n&gt; house has enough=\r\n to give to every beggar and does not mind giving \nto many \n&gt; beggars at th=\r\ne same time if they are worthy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, if one beggar gets something=\r\n, it will be so much that \nhe/she can \n&gt; share some of it with all around h=\r\nim/her. If you go with 100 other \nbeggars \n&gt; and beg, you are better off. I=\r\nf any one of them is able to melt \nthe heart of \n&gt; the owner of the house, =\r\nall the hundred will benefit from it to \nvarying \n&gt; degrees!\n&gt; \n&gt; When I te=\r\nll people about external practices such as homam and \ninternal \n&gt; practices=\r\n such as surrender and detachment in actions, all I am \nreally doing \n&gt; is =\r\nto take fellow beggars in front of a house where a rich person \nlives. If \n=\r\n&gt; they are able to melt the heart of the owner of the house, their \nbegging=\r\n \n&gt; will be fruitful. That is completely in *their* hands.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am only a=\r\n beggar who can show a place where other beggars can \nbeg and I am \n&gt; not r=\r\neally &quot;capable&quot; of anything more. Please do not treat me in \nany other \n&gt; w=\r\nay.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Swami Brahmananda, the spiritual son of Ramakrishna \nParamaha=\r\nmsa, and \n&gt; Thakur himself saw themselves as beggars in front of the Mother=\r\n, \nmama kim \n&gt; kathaa (what is my story).\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; In general, to th=\r\nose who are struggling with internal conflicts \nrelated to \n&gt; spiritual pro=\r\ngress and getting frustrated, I have a few words. \nRome is not \n&gt; built in =\r\na day. Forget Rome, even a small protocol of Rome is not \nbuilt in a \n&gt; day=\r\n! Be patient.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have seen people change from inside out in a short spa=\r\nn of time. \nThere is \n&gt; no need to panic or give up hope.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; B=\r\ne patient. Read scriptures. Read the words of saints and yogis \nsuch as \n&gt; =\r\nRamakrishna Paramahamsa, Ramana Maharshi, Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, \n&gt; Sankarac=\r\nharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Sai Baba, Kabir, \nJesus Christ, \n&gt; Bud=\r\ndha, Mahavira, Jnaneshwar etc. Try to understand what they are \nsaying. \n&gt; =\r\nTry to integrate some of it into your common sense, your way of \nthinking a=\r\nnd \n&gt; your life style. Realize that the goal of spiritual practices is \ninn=\r\ner \n&gt; transformation. The archives of this yahoogroup also have some \ninspi=\r\nred \n&gt; writings.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nobody can change you. You yourself can do it. You CA=\r\nN do it, if \nyou really \n&gt; want to. Introspect and go to the root of your p=\r\nroblems. If you \nintrospect \n&gt; and analyze each big problem, you will reali=\r\nze that ego is the \nroot of it \n&gt; all. Whenever something in life seems fun=\r\ndamentally important, \nquestion why. \n&gt; I am not saying to leave it. Do wha=\r\nt you normally do. But, atleast \nanalyze \n&gt; why it is important and try to =\r\nunderstand your inner motives. Scuh \n&gt; introspection will eventually lighte=\r\nn the clouds of fear, \nexpectation, \n&gt; attachment and pride that often colo=\r\nr one&#39;s attitude.\n&gt; \n&gt; Introspect on your attitude and motives and contempl=\r\nate on the \nnature of \n&gt; god. Meditate.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this age, there is nothing =\r\nlike a total surrender to the Lord. \nOf course, \n&gt; saying &quot;I surrender to y=\r\nou. So give me x or y&quot; is NOT total \nsurrender. Total \n&gt; surrender means yo=\r\nu take whatever the Lord gives without questions \nand \n&gt; expectations. If y=\r\nou can manage it, you are all set!\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Homam or worship of deit=\r\nies in fire is a powerful practice taught \nby rishis. \n&gt; I know from experi=\r\nence that it burns blocking karmas and enables \nthe inner \n&gt; transformation=\r\n. It is a very useful spiritual practice. I know \npeople who \n&gt; made (and a=\r\nre making) considerable spiritual progress through \nregular \n&gt; practice of =\r\nhomam. It is the most powerful method I know of and \nteaching it \n&gt; is one =\r\nof my tasks for this life.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Rajesh, try to make some time in your =\r\ndaily schedule and \nstart doing \n&gt; Mahaganapathi homam everyday. After a fe=\r\nw months, you should \nswitch to \n&gt; Vishnu sahasra naama homam (I will put i=\r\nt up on my website by \nthen). THAT \n&gt; should help you find your way in your=\r\n spiritual life and strike \nthe right \n&gt; balance between spiritual life and=\r\n material life.\n&gt; \n&gt; The purpose of material life on this earth is to perfo=\r\nrm actions \nto pay back \n&gt; debts without incurring new debts, so that spiri=\r\ntual progress \nbecomes \n&gt; smoother. Without paying certain debts, spiritual=\r\n life cannot \nbecome smooth. \n&gt; However, without some spiritual progress, a=\r\nctions in material life \ncreate \n&gt; new debts. In the beginning, one needs t=\r\no create a synergy between \nthe two \n&gt; and use the actions in material life=\r\n to promote spiritual life. \nFor true \n&gt; spiritual progress, most people ca=\r\nnnot and should not run away \nfrom material \n&gt; life.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vasishtha said in=\r\n the very beginning of Yoga Vaasishtham that \naction and \n&gt; knowledge are t=\r\nwo wings with which the bird of manifested Self \nflies and \n&gt; becomes liber=\r\nated. Action without correct knowledge creates pride, \npromote \n&gt; ego and b=\r\ninds one further instead of liberating. Knowledge without \naction \n&gt; does n=\r\not become complete because of the remaining debts and one is \nstuck. \n&gt; One=\r\n needs to have true knowledge and perform actions, to become \nfree.\n&gt; \n&gt; Be=\r\nst regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.or=\r\ng/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ \nta=\r\nrpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free =\r\nJyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish =\r\nsoftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre =\r\n(SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; F=\r\nrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogro=\r\nups. com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, December 18, 2008 3:29 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Raju,\n&gt; \n&gt; Have patience !

Z fin=\r\nds that the same Desire has Risen again, he again\n&gt; satsfies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same=\r\n with the same action. these cycle keeps going on & on\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many yea=\r\nrs. Mr. Z feels like most in the world that this desire\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have sex=\r\nual relationship is &#39;Natural&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now let&#39;s analysie the above cas=\r\ne. Though mr.Z satsfies the \nwant\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; copulation, it comes back agai=\r\nn & again. it means that the\n&gt; desire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has never been satsfied even by=\r\n giving it FOOD Again & again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Our spiritual giants equvivo=\r\ncally say that The Energy which is\n&gt; lost\n&gt; &gt; &gt; during copulation is the BE=\r\nST Energy available in a person \nwhich\n&gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; restrained, controlled an=\r\nd preserved, can easly become OJAS and\n&gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; help immensly in the pat=\r\nh of Spiritual journey.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consider that our Mr. Z some how go=\r\nt to read the above \nparagraph\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; started seriously thinking abo=\r\nut it. He tells himself that he\n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; refrain from intercourse for =\r\n3 months. The earlier frequency \nwas\n&gt; &gt; 2/3\n&gt; &gt; &gt; days, now he suddenly fi=\r\nnds that desire has completely \novertaken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him. after 15 days, he find=\r\ns that Desire has gone in to his\n&gt; every\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pour and every thought and h=\r\ne gives up and succumbs to that\n&gt; &gt; gigantic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; force of Kaam Vaasana. T=\r\nhis may be called suppression initially\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which failed the effort. The =\r\nperson again analyses what went\n&gt; wrong\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and again tries to do the sam=\r\ne and again fails. he keeps on\n&gt; trying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and keeps on failing. during =\r\nthis battles, he is also exploring\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering knowledge of exper=\r\nienced people and knowledge from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual books. he understands that=\r\n if he needs to win the\n&gt; Final\n&gt; &gt; &gt; WAR with this Very Formidable enemy, =\r\nhe needs to do lot of\n&gt; things\n&gt; &gt; &gt; simultaneously and he then resorts to =\r\nthe help from many\n&gt; quarters.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He starts taking cold water bath, star=\r\nts reading spiritual\n&gt; books,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stops reading film magazine, stops watc=\r\nhing Films and TV Shows,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reduces eating Onion and garlic, starts doin=\r\ng Yoga Aasan,\n&gt; &gt; Meditation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and so on and so forth. taking the aids =\r\nthus he keeps on\n&gt; batteling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the *Natural Desire* and still keep=\r\ns on loosing. but the\n&gt; good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; news is that his days of batteling befor=\r\ne loosing has \nincreased.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; started from 10 days, he has now reached th=\r\ne struggeling\n&gt; capacity\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 90 days. (WE ARE ASSUMING HERE THAT H=\r\nIS WIFE IS FULLY\n&gt; COOPERATIVE\n&gt; &gt; OF\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HIS THEATRICS).

Now Sexual Desire which =\r\nwas his *Natural*\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him has been replaced by Brahmacharya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Supression&#39; when combined with Thoughtful Suspension, equipped\n&gt; &gt; w=\r\nith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; every possible preparation and will power to try untiringly\n&gt; aga=\r\nin &\n&gt; &gt; &gt; again finally results in to annihilation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; 2.

life\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; they would have ended, f=\r\norever, the physical relationship \nwith\n&gt; &gt; &gt; their\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spouses=\r\n.\n&gt;

Don&#39;t be ov=\r\ner-burdened by it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, what=\r\n i read in AGHORA was the important thing\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove them from the root\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; True, suppressing desire will make the desire come back\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n later.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, if one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keeps fulfilling =\r\ndesires, they never end!! This is the\n&gt; &gt; nature\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whether one desires money or knowled=\r\nge (of anything other\n&gt; &gt; than\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Self) or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; physical pleasures, the desire will never end no matter\n&gt; how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one gets.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Removi=\r\nng desire from the root often requires suppressing\n&gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ndesire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporarily. But the thing to remember from the =\r\nAghora\n&gt; book\n&gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that just\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suppre=\r\nssing desire is not sufficient. Practice \nsuppressing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; des=\r\nires, but do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remember that the final goal is to uproot =\r\nit fully and\n&gt; keep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for \nbrahamchar=\r\nya\n&gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time pr=\r\nobasbly i can also\n&gt; do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; That is the right spirit!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spir=\r\nitual progress involves a lot of things and\n&gt; brahmacharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The most fundamental thing is to =\r\novercome ego and not\n&gt; become\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attached to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; things. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions and\n&gt; &gt; possessions\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; developing a sense of surrender is the=\r\n most fundamental\n&gt; thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There ar=\r\ne several things in spiritual progress. They all\n&gt; come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; t=\r\nogether! One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person may develop detachment to actions a=\r\nnd possessions\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brahmacharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may=\r\n become easy as a result. One person may achieve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; brahmacharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; first and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; detachment may become easy as a re=\r\nsult and come later.\n&gt; &gt; Various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; signs of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; spiritual progress come almost together, but the exact\n&gt; order\n&gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nan\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person to person. Thus=\r\n, do not be disappointed by your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inability\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something.

&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that as mentio=\r\nned in recent thread on brahamcharya,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was important =\r\nto maintain brahamcharya but i wanted to\n&gt; ask\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even vimalananda had to work for 6 years for overcoming\n&gt; lust=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he had his deity with him from =\r\nthe very early in life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how can nor=\r\nmal college going people like me who don&#39;t \neven\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; deity obtain this goal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though i try to maintain=\r\n physical brahamcharya for few\n&gt; months\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after=\r\n that i am not able to hold it ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and even if i maintain=\r\n some physical chastity it refuses\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; go\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt;

not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; supp=\r\nress desires but remove them from the root\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So, how can i finish it completely from my mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Though i have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on Practice of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Brahamcharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but i don&#39;t think i have made any spiritu=\r\nal progress in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; maintaing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;
