According to reliable sources, there are as many as a \nstaggering on=\r\ne-billion Hindus in the world today.  There are as many \nas three-million H=\r\nindus living in the U.S. alone.  Indeed, if you \nfound yourself drawn to re=\r\nading this column, you are yourself most \nlikely one of this teeming number=\r\n of self-identified Hindus.  While \nthe numbers of Hindus in the world may =\r\nbe impressive, however (and \nthe numbers are indeed to be seen as a source =\r\nof pride), numbers \nalone don&#39;t always point to the actual strength of a re=\r\nligion.  \n\nThe number of adherents of a religion do not, after all, always =\r\n\ncorrespond to the quality of the individuals practicing the \nreligion.  An=\r\nd it is really the inner strength of the individual \nreligious persons that=\r\n is the source of the outer strength of any \nreligion.  This is the case fo=\r\nr Hinduism (Sanatana Dharma) as much as \nany other religion.  \n\nReligion is=\r\n ultimately not just a numbers game.  Rather it is a \nmatter of personal co=\r\nnviction, depth of realization, and inner \nspiritual experience.  Religion =\r\nis ultimately a radically personal \nexperience, and not just a group dynami=\r\nc or a demographic statistic.  \nThis truth being the case, I have made a di=\r\nstinction between two \ntypes of &quot;Hindus&quot; in the world today.  There are wha=\r\nt I call &quot;Nominal \nHindus&quot; and &quot;Conscious Hindus&quot;.  The real question for y=\r\nou is:  Which \nof these two types of Hindus are you?\n\nA Nominal Hindu is a =\r\nHindu in name only.  That is, they have no \ndifficulty necessarily saying t=\r\nhat they&#39;re Hindu.  That comes easy \nenough.  But this mostly cultural iden=\r\ntity is often as far as the \ntypical Nominal Hindu is willing to go into ex=\r\nploring the depths of \ntheir spirituality.  The real question, of course, i=\r\ns not just are \nyou willing to call yourself Hindu=85but are you consciousl=\r\ny and \nsincerely practicing Sanatana Dharma (Hinduism)?  \n\nLike the Nominal=\r\n Hindu, the Conscious Hindu also has no difficulty \nproclaiming &quot;mein hindu=\r\n hun.&quot;  &quot;I am a Hindu.&quot;  But unlike the \nNominal Hindu, the Conscious Hindu=\r\n actually knows what this claim \nmeans=85and he knows so as a result of his=\r\n own personal experience.  \nThe Conscious Hindu not only identifies with Sa=\r\nnatana Dharma, the \nmost ancient and profound spiritual system the world ha=\r\ns ever known, \nbut he also has immense pride in this heritage, and isn&#39;t af=\r\nraid to \nshow it!\n\nMore, the Conscious Hindu knows that it is his duty to n=\r\not only revel \nin the greatness of Dharmic culture, but that to be a true H=\r\nindu he \nmust also do everything in his power to live the life of a Hindu. =\r\n A \nConscious Hindu joyfully embraces the Hindu lifestyle.  \n\nAs a Consciou=\r\ns Hindu, you must be knowledgeable about the philosophy \nand teachings of S=\r\nanatana Dharma, reading the Bhagavad Gita daily and \nfamiliarizing yourself=\r\n with the meaning of Dharma.  More, you must \nknow that it isn&#39;t enough to =\r\nmerely read about Sanatana Dharma, but \nthat you must also practice its pri=\r\nnciples (puja, meditation, arati, \nYoga, etc.) and ethics (non-stealing, no=\r\nt lying, being noble, etc.).  \nFinally, it also is not even enough merely t=\r\no practice Dharma by \nrote, but you must practice with the ultimate end-goa=\r\nl in mind:  The \ngoal of Sanatana Dharma =96 Hinduism =96 is to know, and l=\r\nove, and serve \nBhagavan =96 God.  The ultimate purpose of both Hinduism, a=\r\nnd life \nitself, is having deep and abiding Bhakti =96 devotion toward God.=\r\n  \n\nIt is ultimately only by living your life as a Conscious Hindu - \nrecla=\r\niming your spiritual heritage in Sanatana Dharma and joyously \npracticing t=\r\nhis path =96 that you will know the true happiness, peace, \nfulfillment and=\r\n joy that your spiritual tradition has to offer you.  \nBecome a Conscious H=\r\nindu, live the Hindu lifestyle, and begin to \nexperience the true joy of th=\r\ne presence of God in your life.  \n\nThe Author:\nDr. Frank Morales (Sri Dharm=\r\na Pravartaka Acharya) has been a \npracticing American Hindu for over 30 yea=\r\nrs.
