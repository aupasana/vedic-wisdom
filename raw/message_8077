Learned members can answer you the rest with their kno=\r\nwledge and experience. Please look for my replies below, started with &quot;TC&quot; =\r\n-\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; My dilemma. I struggle to keep the fire burning by adding dried coc=\r\nonut pieces, drops of ghee, other such material while I recite the various =\r\nmantras prescribed in the manual. But it bothers me that my attention is on=\r\n maintaining the fire when I should be concentrating on the mantras (I try =\r\nto guess the real meaning behind the words in the mantra, I understand some=\r\n intuitively, some not at all, I take the whole by faith). At times when th=\r\ne fire goes out I feel very bad. &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nTC: It happened with me also. The ma=\r\nngo-wood and jute sticks were burning out very very rapidly and I was very =\r\nworried to maintain the fire and could not concentrate fully on the mantras=\r\n.\n\nTC: Seeing the video of Narasimha Ji I felt that coconuts must burn slow=\r\ner and it should relieve you from the worries related to maintaining the fi=\r\nre. I don&#39;t know why your coconuts are also burning out fast. I can give yo=\r\nu my opinion after I do it with coconuts.\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; Espeically towards the end,=\r\n when i start to meditate, if I have to worry about the fire dying out, I f=\r\neel miserable because this is the most important part of the homam, accordi=\r\nng to the manual (well, Mr Narasimha). &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nTC: Same problem I faced also.=\r\n\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I also notice that at times the drops of ghee falling on a small fir=\r\ne actually put it off! So I have started to add the drops to the side of th=\r\ne burning flame, may be on a piece of coconut. I make the ghee at home, so =\r\nI do not suspect the quality of the ghee:-))&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;\n\nTC: Same happened to me a=\r\nlso. But let me tell you something. When I was putting ghee on the mango wo=\r\nod, some ghee was immediately absorbed by the wood and the wood was getting=\r\n wet and fire was going off from that wet part of the wood. It was making m=\r\ne very worried. However later I found out that even though the wood was get=\r\nting wet and the fire was going off, soon the wet part was becoming hot wit=\r\nh the fire again and thus fire was coming back there. So may be what you sh=\r\nould do is to be a little patient while fire goes off from one part (and le=\r\nt OTHER AREA burn)... and wait a few second to see if the fire comes back i=\r\nn the wet part of the wood again, as the wet part becomes hot also. This sh=\r\nould work. This worked for me.\n\nTC: As I have observed, ghee is like oil or=\r\n something and it burns ITSELF. Thus if your coconut piece is burnt almost =\r\nto ash, you still add ghee ahutis over that &quot;almost ash coconut&quot; or &quot;almost=\r\n ash wood&quot; and still the fire is burnt through the ghee drops, because ghee=\r\n itself is burning, though under the ghee there is almost nothing to burn b=\r\necause the coconut is almost ash... but since ghee itself is burning, it is=\r\n not a problem.\n\nTC: I guess this is why Narasimha Ji and other experienced=\r\n persons can do homam with a relatively small amount of coconut.\n\nLearned m=\r\nembers can correct me if I am wrong.\n\nYours,\nTanvir.\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
