As I said \nearlier, it is possible to achieve the one-pointed focus of mind on any \ncombination of sounds. When one&#39;s mind repeats the same combination of \nsounds over and over again, eventually one&#39;s mind may lose all other \nthoughts and become absorbed in that combination of sounds. THEN one&#39;s mind \nexperiences the energy represented by that combination of sounds.\n\nDifferent combinations of sounds have different energies. But experiencing \nthe energy of any combination of sounds is a better experience for the mind \nthan the regular chaotic experiences mind has in a cacaphony of thoughts.\n\nThe energy represented by properly chanted Veda mantras is in a different \nleague. However, it is almost impossible to chant Veda mantras perfectly in \ntoday&#39;s times. The knowledge is lost. The way people chant them, veda \nmantras get corrupted and they end up working like other mantras and do not \nreally act as veda mantras. Even if one experiences a veda mantra, one \nexperiences the energy of a corrupted version and not of the original veda \nmantra.\n\nThe expression &quot;Om bhur bhuvah suvah/svah&quot; is not part of the actual savitru \ngayatri mantra. The actual veda mantra starts with &quot;tat savitur&quot; and ends \nwith &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n\nI never recorded an audio clip of my Gayatri chanting. I only hummed the ups \nand downs to show the intonation. I was instructed to never chant Savitru \nGayatri mantra loud. Spiritually speaking, that mantra is my food and I get \nwhatever little energy I have from it. In order to continue doing my dharma \nin the world, I will need to be selfish with my food. I can share everything \nelse with the world.\n\nAstrology knowledge that we have on earth today is insufficient to give \nperfect guidance. A good guru may be able to do a better job than astrology \nas we understand it.\n\nI have seen my guru make some interesting mantra suggestions. For example, I \nonce mentioned to Manish a friend who visits me often and meditates when I \ndo homam. Manish said, &quot;he will not be interested in doing homam by himself. \nIf at all he does, it will not be Mahaganapathi homam or Chandi homam. Teach \nhim Vishnu sahasra naama homam. He MAY be interested in that. He will like \nVishnu sahasra naama stotram.&quot; I had not mentioned much about that person to \nManish and only said the name. Interestingly, Vishnu sahasra naama stotra is \nindeed a favorite prayer of that person. Another time, I met a person who \nloves Ganapathi atharva seersham and chants it everyday and interested in \ndoing Mahaganapathi homam. Manish told me, &quot;if he wants, he can do \nMahaganapathi homam. But eventually there is another sadhana he needs to do. \nHe needs to chant Hanuman Chalisa everyday 108 or 54 times for one whole \nyear. It will transform his life.&quot; I had not mentioned anything about that \nperson to Manish. Interestingly, when this person was young, he was a sishya \nof a great spiritual master in the lineage of Sadguru Samartha Ramadas \n(considered to be born with  Lord Hanuman&#39;s amsa). He said to me later that \nhis guru had also advised him in the past to just stick to Hanuman chalisa! \nInterestingly, the same suggestion came to Manish&#39;s mind.\n\nOf course, Manish tells me at other times that he knows nothing and says \nwhatever comes to his mind. If he ends up giving correct guidance to \nsomeone, he says it is because the Mother wanted someone to get correct \nguidance and he is just a nimitta.\n\nI believe that a sadguru with very limited individual ego and in tune with \nNature will be able to give far better guidance in spiritual sadhana than \nastrology as we know it today.\n\nFor Mars and Rahu in 8th, I can suggest Lord Subrahmanya.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Sunday, January 04, 2009 3:45 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] gayatri mantra\n\n&gt; dear narasimha ji and friends,\n&gt; namaste!\n&gt;\n&gt; i understand that the syllables / metre of the mantra is very\n&gt; important. that is why (probably) mantra was passed on from the guru\n&gt; to ths sishya by word of mouth. somebody even said that in the end\n&gt; it is the metre only that remains in the mantra...and not even the\n&gt; words. something like the smile of the cheshire cat remaining even\n&gt; when the cat itself vanishes in alice in the wonderland.\n&gt;\n&gt; i too have been looking at / bringing to my consciousness the\n&gt; gayatri mantra of late. for lack of guidance, i have been relying on\n&gt; the internet. the first thing that kind of took my breath away was\n&gt; the layers and layers of meaning attached to each word of the\n&gt; mantra. that is probably because all sanskrit words are like\n&gt; that....you peel one layer and another layer lies below..and then\n&gt; still another and another....\n&gt;\n&gt; but more importantly (perhaps) is the different ways this mantra\n&gt; gets recited. i tried to count the syllables to see whether they\n&gt; added upto 24. they almost did, to my recknoning, but i wasn&#39;t sure\n&gt; whether om in the beginning is part of the mantra or not. it probaly\n&gt; is, but i want to be sure.\n&gt;\n&gt; secondly, depending on who chants the mantra, the words\n&gt; are &quot;spelt&quot; / &quot;pronounced&quot; differently. For instance in one\n&gt; rendering i found &quot;swah&quot; being pronounced as &quot;suvah&quot; which becomes\n&gt; two syllables instead of one. simarly, in the same\n&gt; rendering &quot;prachodyat&quot; is stretched to 3 syllables instead of 2.\n&gt;\n&gt; so i am confused as to the &quot;right&quot; rendition.\n&gt;\n&gt; i recall, quite some time back, narsimha ji had posted his rendition\n&gt; of the gayatri mantra in an audio clip. i have not been able to find\n&gt; it again. but i wish he or someone could guide me about this.\n&gt;\n&gt; i would also like to know the importance of the number of syllables\n&gt; in each mantra and how this is suitable for different persons\n&gt; depending on their &quot;karmic structures&quot; which are sometimes / always\n&gt; (?) reflected in the astrological chart. maybe a guru by just\n&gt; looking at a person can know intuitively what is the &quot;right&quot; mantra\n&gt; for the person. maybe a good astrologer can also do the same.\n&gt;\n&gt; i know this is not an astrology forum, but still i am seeking\n&gt; guidance on &quot;appeasement&quot; of mars and rahu in 8th house and retro\n&gt; saturn in 6th house for taurus lagna...throough mantra. These\n&gt; planets aspect all the other planets (jupiter, sun and mercury in\n&gt; 2nd house and venus moon in third house).\n&gt;\n&gt; thankyou!\n&gt;\n&gt; love and best wishes,&#39;\n&gt; vinita\n\n\n"}}
