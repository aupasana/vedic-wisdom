As a rule of =\r\nthumb, if one begins his study from a biased point of view, he will never h=\r\nave the complete picture, even if he is given all the relevant pointers.\n\n =\r\n  Why do you think I would paint the complete picture, somebody has already=\r\n painted it time and again in scriptures, but you seem to fail to read it ?=\r\n \n\n&gt; If you take Samkhya, there are 24 elements, of which 5 are basic. \n&gt; A=\r\nnd the rest are subtle. So when normal creation is spoken of, it \n&gt; is spok=\r\nen off in terms of 5 elements and not 6. \n\n  Despite all the knowledge that=\r\n you have - it is evident that you have not studied Sankhya thoroughly.\n   =\r\n6 x 4 =3D 24\n   It actually refers to 6 tattwas - Where are the 4 antahkara=\r\nnas&#39; coming from NaraSimha  - and why are they called AntahKaranas&#39; at all =\r\n? Are your doubts over that Sankhya mentions about the 6th tattwa ?\n\n  Give=\r\nn the amount of discord and contradictions amongst the scriptural interpret=\r\nations and authorities, Badrayana had to write &quot;Brahma Sutras&quot;.\n\n  If you a=\r\nre discerning enough and re-read all the scriptures you have ever read, you=\r\n will most certainly figure out that every scripture has mentioned about th=\r\ne 6th tattwa everywhere. All we need is to rise above the dogma propounded =\r\nby a lot of people around us who have selfish motives, and keep working in =\r\nthe correct direction.\n\n  Vivekananda, mentioned it, but had not coined the=\r\n term &quot;superether&quot; for this 6th tattwa, while Yogananda was not a Jnana Yog=\r\ni - but I take his word as scriptural authority given his level of self-rea=\r\nlization.\n\n&gt; When you say that Gunas by &quot;inherent duality&quot; in nature give r=\r\nise \n&gt; to 6 tattwas, I guess you are using a simple multiplication of 3 x &gt;=\r\n 2 and arriving at six.\n\n  Also, what is so wrong with a simple multiplicat=\r\nion where multiplication is required ? Do you know what is &quot;Law of Duality&quot;=\r\n ?\n\n&gt; Umm, with due respect, no it is not yet easy. Lot of hazy areas \n&gt; ye=\r\nt. Kindly check above.\n\n  Do you know Jyotish ? Didn&#39;t I mention that Naras=\r\nimha could probably figure it out ? Let him reply at his own accord.\n\n  BTW=\r\n, don&#39;t really want to go into kriya yoga of lahiri mahashaya, because it i=\r\ns better learnt from a teacher than discussed.\n\n&gt; &quot;....Ajna and mooladhara =\r\nchakras are closely related, and the awakening of one helps to awaken the o=\r\nther.\n\n   What is any other possible meaning of this line than that the two=\r\n chakras awaken each other and are related ?\n\n   Ganesha is worshipped firs=\r\nt because mooladhara is connected with Ajna chakra and the breathing proces=\r\ns involves these two chakras\n(HaM-SaH). The breath connection makes it the =\r\nmost suitable place to connect the highest and lowest expressions of God-co=\r\nnsciousness, from brahma to a worm - every living creature breathes! \n\n   I=\r\n hope this explicitly clarifies.\n\nRegards,\nNitish\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Nitish,\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; Please find some more comments from my side mentioned below.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Re=\r\ngards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Sh=\r\niva Sutra\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Thu, 1/10/09, yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; From: yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Order=\r\n of Creation, Physics & Reality\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: =\r\nThursday, 1 October, 2009, 5:52 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; || OM TAT SAT=\r\n ||\n&gt; Namaskar Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have not read the diaries of Lahiri Mahasha=\r\nya, so lets drop all that &quot;technicalities&quot; out of the discussion. The speci=\r\nfic diagram is in &quot;God talks with Arjuna, Self-Realization Fellowship, Jaic=\r\no Publishing House, 2002&quot; - Part -2 of that book.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Well, I have s=\r\neen the diagram you are refering to. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Technicalities, I feel,=C2=\r\n=A0 should not be dropped, because in that case the conversation will becom=\r\ne too hazy. Further, one may use the same term to mean something else and k=\r\neep needlessly arguing over a non issue. Precise, clear definitions are the=\r\n first step in a meaningful dialogue.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Here is the relevant Text:\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &quot;....Ajna and mooladhara chakras are closely related, and the awakening =\r\nof one helps to awaken the other. Ideally, ajna should be awakened to some =\r\nextent before mooladhara, in order to allow an unaffected perception of the=\r\n energies manifested by mooladhara and the lower chakras. However, the awak=\r\nening of mooladhara will help to further awaken ajna. In fact, the best way=\r\n to bring about awakening of ajna is through the practices of moola bandha =\r\nand ashwini mudra which are specific for mooladhara.. ..&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, thanks=\r\n for the quote. However, this does not say that &quot;awakening&quot; of one will aut=\r\nomatically &quot;awaken&quot; the other. It says, in an ideal case one should &quot;awaken=\r\n&quot; Agya chakra to some extent before trying to awaken Mooladhara chakra. \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; In a lot of people chakras remain &quot;awakened in various degrees&quot;wit=\r\nhout any conscinous effort. Rarely would an individual appear who have abso=\r\nlutely zero awakening of all chakras. In most cases, &quot;partially awakenend&quot; =\r\nchakras do exist, but I am not sure if that is of any significant help in p=\r\nractical spirituality.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Plus, this is one of the possible paths o=\r\nf progess in Yoga, not the only one possible. Hence, we should not jump to =\r\nconclusions which are not explicitly stated. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; A fact, required t=\r\no understand why Ganesh, deity of Mooladhara, is worshipped first.\n&gt; =C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Ganesha is worshipped first because it presides over the Mooladhara, =\r\nnot because mooladhara has a connection with Agya. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Regarding th=\r\ne 6th tattwa there is nothing new to it, it already exists, Yogananda write=\r\ns in his commentary the following:\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;...Beyond the subtlest physical vi=\r\nbration (akasha, ether), Paramahansa Yogananda explained, is the superether=\r\n,&quot; a finer manifestation and therefore not classified as one of the physica=\r\nl vibratory elements (tattvas), of which there are only five-earth, water, =\r\nfire, air, ether. Some yoga treatises define this tattwa as mind, or &#39;non-m=\r\natter&#39; , as opposed to matter or gross vibration... .&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sorry, but=\r\n the above quote is a little vague. It no where mentions that Chitta is a 6=\r\nth tattwa. What it does it says about the 5 gross elements and &quot;a finer man=\r\nifestation&quot;. Maybe the intented audience for this passage was one who is no=\r\nt intellectually aware of the basic=C2=A0idea of five creative elements. Ot=\r\nherwise, the &quot;super-ether&quot; needs more clarity. Is it prakiriti? It is Chitt=\r\na? Is it really sixth or does the six have more subsets? Is he calling it a=\r\n vague six because we cannot be aware of the higher tattwas beyond the five=\r\n, therefore clubbing everything together into one?\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As you mentio=\r\nned Samkhya, it uses a calssification of the universe in 24 tattwas with 5 =\r\nwhich cause physical manifestations to occur. It is still not 6 by any meas=\r\nure.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Again in Kasmiri Shaivism, they define 36 tattwas! That is =\r\nwhy the need to be technically precise so that we may not misunderstand eac=\r\nh other.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; The tattwas are 5 in number as per multiple Hindu scr=\r\niptures, both &gt; Agamas/Nigamas as well as Upanishads.\n&gt; \n&gt; Which scriptures=\r\n ? Quotes ? \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Check the quotation given by Sundeep right at the b=\r\negining of this set of mails. Are you questioning the veracity of scripture=\r\ns or the fact that they mention creation is caused by five gross elements?\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It is through Sankhya, that you can understand why Chitta is relate=\r\nd to it. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As I said before, no one is denying the existence of C=\r\nhitta. One is however questioning whether Chitta is a &#39;6th element&#39; . If yo=\r\nu take Samkhya, there are 24 elements, of which 5 are basic. And the rest a=\r\nre subtle. So when normal creation is spoken of, it is spoken off in terms =\r\nof 5 elements and not 6. When the essence of spirituality is spoken off rig=\r\nht upto the state of God, then we go into 24 or 36 (depending on your class=\r\nification). Further, in the 36 element lists, the &quot;suddha-tattwas&quot; are defi=\r\nned as unknowable from this plane of existence. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As Nar=\r\nasimha knows Jyotish shastra also, he could probably figure out the rashi t=\r\no which the 6th tattwa is attributed since I have already given the table o=\r\nut, so it is as real as it rises daily.\n&gt; \n&gt; Umm, with due respect, no it i=\r\ns not yet easy.

It seems to =\r\nbe his extrapolation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What you quoted from Taittariya =\r\nUpanishad is the traditional view that I am familiar with. Other scriptures=\r\n refer to the same order of creation, including &quot;Yoga Vaasishtham&quot; , where =\r\nMaharshi Vasishtha teaches creation, destruction and liberation to Lord Ram=\r\na.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This Upanishadic underst=\r\nanding is also consistent with chakra based understanding of Tantra. The fi=\r\nve chakras downwards from Visuddhi chakra to Moolaadhaara chakra represent =\r\nether, air, fire, water and earth. When Kundalini leaves Moolaadhaara, eart=\r\nh element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of earth element are e=\r\nffaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. When Kundalini leaves Swaadhishthaana, wate=\r\nr element within one is surrendered, i.e. all traces of water element are e=\r\nffaced in one&#39;s self-awareness. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By earth an=\r\nd water etc, don&#39;t just think of physical earth and physical water etc. Ear=\r\nth element shows a solid state of existence. Water element shows a flexible=\r\n and fluid state of existence. For example, an idea that one &quot;owns&quot; a parti=\r\ncular thing (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of solid s=\r\ntate and made of earth element. An idea that one &quot;needs&quot; a particular thing=\r\n (e.g. a car, a house, spouse, some knowledge etc) is of the nature of wate=\r\nr element. Thus, different mental concepts and ideas can be mapped to the f=\r\nive elements.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When one thinks of &quot;I&quot;, one perhaps thin=\r\nks of a body that looks and feels in a particular way physically. Apart fro=\r\nm the physical aspect, one may think of &quot;I&quot; as someone who has certain qual=\r\nities, certain needs, certain belongings etc. All those concepts one has ab=\r\nout who one is, form one&#39;s self-awareness and Kundalini represents that sel=\r\nf-awareness. Kundalini cannot leave Moolaadhaara chakra, if *anything* that=\r\n is *solid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is is still r=\r\nemaining. Kundalini cannot leave Swaadhishthaana chakra, if *anything* that=\r\n is *solid* or *fluid* in nature within one&#39;s cumulative idea of who one is=\r\n is still remaining. And so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Many people who talk a=\r\nbout experiences of Kundalini in higher chakras are often talking merely ab=\r\nout some amount of vaayus flowing in those chakras (which may still be a ni=\r\nce experience) and have *not* experienced Kundalini actually being there. I=\r\nF Kundalini really leaves Moolaadhaara, one will not perceive a solid body,=\r\n one will not have notions of owning anything. Similarly, as Kundalini move=\r\ns up each chakra, each element is effaced in one&#39;s cumulative idea of who o=\r\nne is, at the physical as well as the subtle level of existence! To complet=\r\nely efface even one element (earth) from one&#39;s notion of self (&quot;I&quot;), even f=\r\nor a short duration of time, is not at all easy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The o=\r\nrder in which elements are effaced as one progresses towards samadhi is - e=\r\narth, water, fire, air and ether. If Kundalini again comes down, effaced el=\r\nements return to work in the reverse order - ether, air, fire, water and ea=\r\nrth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding physics and =\r\nspiritual realities:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Does physics describe reality?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Physics tries to describe/model reality at the gross p=\r\nhysical level, as perceived by the external senses. However, one&#39;s mind can=\r\n &quot;perceive&quot; things without the external senses playing a role.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a simple example, one may be asleep and get a dream, in which o=\r\nne&#39;s mind may &quot;see&quot; some people and &quot;hear&quot; a conversation between them. In =\r\nanother example, a yogi may be meditating with a mantra with intense focus =\r\nand &quot;see&quot; some scenes and/or &quot;hear&quot; some things. These things cannot be per=\r\nceived by the external senses and hence cannot be studied by modern science=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is reasonable to define reality as something that=\r\n can be perceived by the external senses, because different people can expe=\r\nrience the same reality using their senses individually and verify the obse=\r\nrvation. However, some experiences of the mind that cannot be perceived by =\r\nsenses are sometimes very powerful and have a huge, life-altering and somet=\r\nimes liberating influence on people. Inability to study and model them is a=\r\n big drawback of modern science.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; One may categorize dreams and internal yogic experiences as imaginati=\r\nons or hallucinations, because there is no independent validation, and call=\r\n them unworthy of a study. But there are cases that make one wonder. For ex=\r\nample, see the following messages from the archives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; M=\r\nystical experiences of mind and mantras (message 951)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://grou=\r\nps. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 951\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the=\r\n above message, one person had a specific yogic experience that was describ=\r\ned in detail and another person seemed to know about it and supplied one ta=\r\nngible detail relating to the experience, suggesting that he too &quot;observed&quot;=\r\n the experience of the first person, though it was beyond the external sens=\r\nes of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Re: Guru (message 391)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nhttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 391\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; In the above message also, one person had a specific yogic experience =\r\nthat was described in detail and another person seemed to know about it and=\r\n supplied a couple of tangible details relating to the experience, suggesti=\r\nng that he too &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the first person, though it was=\r\n beyond the external senses of either person!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Internal=\r\n god and external god (message 2498)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ gr=\r\noup/vedic- wisdom/message/ 2498\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the above message, =\r\none person had a specific yogic experience involving a deity and another pe=\r\nrson perceived with his external senses a vision involving the same deity, =\r\nthough others in the room could not perceive anything with their external s=\r\nenses, suggesting that the second person &quot;observed&quot; the experience of the f=\r\nirst person through a specific prism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Such examples cannot prove much, but they do suggest that perhap=\r\ns *some* experiences that cannot be measured or perceived by the external s=\r\nenses are observable by others, though not everyone may be able to observe.=\r\n Then, one cannot rule out the possibility of *some* experiences that canno=\r\nt be measured or perceived by the external senses being a part of the &quot;real=\r\nity&quot; that mind can access.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But, how can modern science=\r\n study it?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Because the only thing that can be studied =\r\nand measured is the reality involving the gross body and its senses, one ma=\r\ny suggest that experiences of the subtle body may be studied by observing v=\r\narious parts of the gross physical body. For example, one can look at the n=\r\nervous signals flowing through various parts of the brain and try to correl=\r\nate them with the experiences of the subtle body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On t=\r\nhe surface, it sounds like a great idea. But, it assumes that subtle body a=\r\nnd causal body are redundant. Though there is some correspondence between w=\r\nhat happens in the causal, subtle and gross bodies, it is a many-to-many ma=\r\npping and NOT a one-to-one mapping, in which case the concept of causal and=\r\n subtle bodies would be redundant, i.e. whatever they model can be moderled=\r\n using just the gross body!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you drive through a nei=\r\nghborhood and observe the houses from the road, you can have *some* idea of=\r\n what is going on. A particular house with a lot of lights and sound and ma=\r\nny cars parked outside may be having a party. People in one particular hous=\r\ne with no lights are probably out of town. But you can never be sure what i=\r\ns going on in the house, how many people are inside, what exactly they are =\r\ndoing etc, by merely looking at the house from outside.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Similarly, by looking at the nervous signals in various points of the bra=\r\nin, you may be able to see some basic things, but not much. The experiences=\r\n of the subtle mind are beyond your reach and study, if your tools are limi=\r\nted to the gross physical domain.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Unfortunately, modern science cannot study that part of the reality =\r\nwhich is beyond the scope of external senses, unless scientists become yogi=\r\ns and develop mastery of the internal world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; While ris=\r\nhis of ancient times had mastery of the internal world (which is the microc=\r\nosm of the entire universe) and could observe any space-time point, even th=\r\ne greatest yogis of today cannot control their state completely. When Kunda=\r\nlini rises, it may go somewhere and one may experience some part of the Inf=\r\ninite Reality. But one cannot control exactly where Kundalini goes and exac=\r\ntly which part of the Infinite Reality one observes. Rishis seemed to have =\r\na perfect control.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarp=\r\nana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSorry the previous mail went off incomplete. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear=\r\n Sundeep,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me mention some stuff from the diari=\r\nes of Sri Shamacharun Lahiri (a self realized Yogi of the highest order) - =\r\nit maybe of some help to you. He did mention in details about the process o=\r\nf creation as he saw it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As per him, at the beginn=\r\ning was the point of ultimate chaos. Then from there came the &quot;vidhyut&quot; of =\r\nAkash. As this &quot;Vidyut&quot; interacted with the chaos, it produced some univers=\r\nal energies which are more commonly known as the universal deities like Shi=\r\nva, Vishnu etc etc. Then came the &quot;Vidyut&quot; of vayu ( none of these are the =\r\nactual physical elements as we see it, but more the essence of the element,=\r\n hence his use of the word &quot;vidyut&quot; and &quot; taranga&quot;) whose interaction with =\r\nthe chaos resulted in some more energy states. Thus, in this way came, Agni=\r\n, Apa and Prithwi, each one resulting from the previous and each one result=\r\ning in some energy states, which in the end resulted in 33 crore possible s=\r\ntates of energy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is some lesson in there (at=\r\n least for me), and I want to get at it..

There being multiple theories of the String variety, adhered to by mul=\r\ntiple physicists, the M-Theory (11 dimensional one) is one of the many whic=\r\nh &#39;claim to explain&#39; in parts some aspects of the physical world. Finding a=\r\n correlation between this and the idea of the five elements, in my humble o=\r\npinion, is still far fetched. I can understand some correlation between bas=\r\nic Quantum Mechanics, (at least the Copenhegan Interpretation) , non-locali=\r\nty etc, and the ideas of Indian mysticism, but a link between M-theory of p=\r\nanch-mahabhuta? !..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Well, with the kind permission=\r\n of Narasimha, I would like to know more about how exactly you can link the=\r\nse two, because I myself with my limited understand fail to see any viable =\r\ncorrelation at all as of now, specially, since the M-theory is yet in a ver=\r\ny nascent stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The other thing one must think ab=\r\nout is the basic nature of theoritical physics. Does physics describe reali=\r\nty? Or does it provide a model of reality? These two are different. Mathema=\r\ntics provides a tool/model to gauge reality. It need not be exactly as real=\r\nity is. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Which is why Richard Feynman once famously quoted that=\r\n everyone knows that Quatum Mechanics works, but no one know what it really=\r\n is!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea of the pach mahabhuta and creation i=\r\ns almost the essence of everything. The day physics gets THAT deep, there w=\r\nould be really nothing more left to do.

That to=\r\no if we are destined to find out we will, or else no.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The up=\r\nsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; --- On Tue, 29/9/09, vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@ ...&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: vedicastrostudent &lt;vedicastrostudent@ .=\r\n..&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Order of Creation (of mahabhuta/t=\r\nattwa) ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dat=\r\ne: Tuesday, 29 September, 2009, 1:12 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear N=\r\narasimhaji and others,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Taittiriya Upanishad=\r\n (http://www.sacred- texts.com/ hin/sbe15/ sbe15034. htm), the following is=\r\n the order of creation (Max Mueller interpretation) :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;From that Self 2 (Brahman) sprang ether (=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=86&#39;=C3=83=\r\n=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A2k=C3=83=C6&#39;=C3=86&#39;=C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82=C2=A2sa, that =\r\nthrough which we hear); from ether air (that through which we hear and feel=\r\n); from air fire (that through which we hear, feel, and see); from fire wat=\r\ner (that through which we hear, feel, see, and taste); from water earth (th=\r\nat through which we hear, feel, see, taste, and smell)&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This sounds logical to me in that I expected Akasa to be first an=\r\nd earth to be last. I have heard differing opinions though, perhaps in Sanj=\r\nay Rathji&#39;s Brhat Nakshtra but since I dont have the book in front of me, I=\r\n cant confirm. Do you agree with the interpretation above, if not what is y=\r\nour belief, source and justification?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thank yo=\r\nu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sundeep\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Connect more, d=\r\no more and share more with Yahoo!
