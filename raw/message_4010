Author has researched the case pretty\n&gt; well and knew =\r\nhim personally, an interesting read. It&#39;s pretty lengthy, if\n&gt; you are read=\r\ning it make sure u have enough time :)\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; http://medhajournal.com/geopol=\r\nitics-guru/973-why-swami-nithyananda-must-resign-now.html?showall=3D1\n&gt;\n&gt; *=\r\nWhy Swami Nithyananda Must Resign Now\n&gt; Wednesday, 17 March 2010 18:40 Raji=\r\nv Malhotra*\n&gt;\n&gt; When the sex scandal of Swami Nithyananda suddenly erupted =\r\non March 2,\n&gt; 2010, I was already in Delhi as part of a group to go to Kumb=\r\nh Mela. I was\n&gt; also finalizing my new book which deals specifically with T=\r\namil Nadu\n&gt; religious politics, and in particular with the role of various =\r\nnexuses based\n&gt; overseas. So I decided to jump into the eye of the storm of=\r\n this scandal in\n&gt; order to investigate whether similar nexuses were at wor=\r\nk in this case.\n&gt; Naturally, at one level I have seen this scandal through =\r\nthe framework of a\n&gt; civilization encounter in which Vedic culture is pitte=\r\nd against the\n&gt; Dravidian divisiveness that is being backed by Christian ev=\r\nangelism. At\n&gt; another level, I found that the sensationalized media report=\r\ns were too\n&gt; one-sided, and none of them had a single statement to report f=\r\nrom the swami\n&gt; himself. Furthermore, there was chaos and mismanagement of =\r\nthe crisis from\n&gt; Swami Nithyananda&#39;s inner circle. In hindsight, things mi=\r\nght have turned out\n&gt; differently had they managed more sensibly and faster=\r\n =96 which I will\n&gt; elaborate later in this article. Given this, another in=\r\nterest of mine has\n&gt; been to extrapolate important lessons from this episod=\r\ne for other Hindu\n&gt; organizations, which I predict will face similar scanda=\r\nls as and when their\n&gt; weaknesses become understood by those opposed to the=\r\nm. This article\n&gt; highlights my findings at these multiple levels and issue=\r\ns.\n&gt;\n&gt; During this 2-week investigative period, I have been loyal to my ple=\r\ndge to\n&gt; give Swami Nithyananda&#39;s organization the benefit of doubt and to =\r\nreport\n&gt; their side of the story. Besides wanting to balance out the one-si=\r\nded media\n&gt; depictions, I wanted access to the ashram&#39;s core group for my o=\r\nwn research\n&gt; on the broader subject of civilization encounters. I respect =\r\nthe\n&gt; sensitivities of that organization consisting of many decent and dedi=\r\ncated\n&gt; devotees who have sacrificed a great deal and stand to lose a lot.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; But I have concluded that the situation is now beyond repair for Swami\n=\r\n&gt; Nithyananda and that his continued involvement can only damage the broade=\r\nr\n&gt; interests of dharma as well as jeopardize the ashramites. Along with tw=\r\no\n&gt; other sympathizers who are not ashramites, I have personally recommende=\r\nd to\n&gt; Swami Nithyananda that the best course at this stage would be for hi=\r\nm to\n&gt; resign completely from his organization. He should turn it over to a=\r\n small\n&gt; team of senior Hindu mahatmas, so that the assets can be used in t=\r\nhe best\n&gt; interests of dharma. Further, under the guidance of these mahatma=\r\ns he must\n&gt; live a quiet life as a sadhu devoid of any institutional respon=\r\nsibilities.\n&gt; Because the head of any organization must accept responsibili=\r\nty that &quot;the\n&gt; buck stops here,&quot; only such a move can salvage the organizat=\r\nion and the\n&gt; reputation of dharma at large. Over several years, this resig=\r\nnation would\n&gt; hopefully reduce the massive pressure that has built up agai=\r\nnst him\n&gt; personally, and enable him to live peacefully as a sadhu. It is u=\r\np to him to\n&gt; accept or reject this advice. The basis for this conclusion b=\r\necomes clearer\n&gt; once the reader has gone through the rest of this article.=\r\n\n&gt; I want to begin by examining some principles about the relationships\n&gt; b=\r\netween siddhis (extraordinary yogic powers), morality, Tantra and sex. This=\r\n\n&gt; will provide the framework in which to interpret what has happened. Then=\r\n I\n&gt; will turn to my initial interest in pursuing the challenges facing Hin=\r\nduism\n&gt; in south India from a variety of forces.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Siddhis (Extraordina=\r\nry Yogic Powers) and Morality\n&gt; A few days ago, I had the honor of having a=\r\n two-hour private conversation\n&gt; with Sri Sri Ravi Shankar at his ashram in=\r\n Rishikesh. I introduced myself as\n&gt; an independent researcher who is writi=\r\nng a series of books on Indian\n&gt; civilization in the context of the global =\r\nchallenges and opportunities. One\n&gt; of my volumes will be specifically on t=\r\nhe major global gurus since the 1960s\n&gt; =96 including Krishnamurti, Swami M=\r\nuktananda, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi,\n&gt; Pabhupada, among others - as well as li=\r\nving global gurus such as Sri Sri\n&gt; himself. I have been investigating what=\r\n happened to such gurus, in terms of\n&gt; the shifts in their Western follower=\r\ns over time, their scandals, their\n&gt; Indian followers and critics, and also=\r\n how each guru negotiated his/her\n&gt; position sandwiched between Indian orth=\r\nodoxy on one side and Western\n&gt; modernity on the other. The relevance of th=\r\nis in the context of Swami\n&gt; Nithyananda will become clear very soon.\n&gt;\n&gt; T=\r\nhe first provocative question I asked Sri Sri concerned the nature of\n&gt; yog=\r\nic powers: What is the relationship between siddhis and morality? If\n&gt; sidd=\r\nhis are a scientific phenomena dealing with powers that can be harnessed\n&gt; =\r\nby all humans then one must bear in mind that science deals with truths tha=\r\nt\n&gt; are morally neutral. If Einstein was declared to have lived an immoral =\r\nlife\n&gt; it would not invalidate his scientific theories. A person who design=\r\ns\n&gt; aircrafts or any other complex technological systems may or may not be =\r\nmoral\n&gt; in order to be effective in his technical work. In other words, rta=\r\nm (the\n&gt; patterns of the cosmos), which we discover and call science, funct=\r\nions\n&gt; independently of human morality. This is why a scientific principle =\r\ncan be\n&gt; used either morally or immorally, because it is independent of mor=\r\nality.\n&gt; There are moral persons who lack any siddhis or even ordinary scie=\r\nntific\n&gt; competence. Conversely, there are great siddhas (like Ravana) who =\r\nlack\n&gt; morality. Sri Sri&#39;s pranayama techniques would also produce results =\r\nfor an\n&gt; immoral person.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sri Sri seemed impressed by this question, and=\r\n agreed with my overall\n&gt; position on the independence between siddhis and =\r\nmorality. But he pointed\n&gt; out that the moral dimension, while not determin=\r\ning the siddhis, was also\n&gt; important because it led to receiving the grace=\r\n of the divine. I agree with\n&gt; him.\n&gt;\n&gt; So there are two separate phenomena=\r\n involved: (i) spiritual technologies\n&gt; that are objective and that allow a=\r\nnyone to harness spiritual energies, and\n&gt; (ii) morality which is important=\r\n in itself, not for attaining siddhis, but\n&gt; in order to have a positive re=\r\nlationship with the divine. Either one can be\n&gt; developed without the other=\r\n; however, the dharma tradition encourages us to\n&gt; cultivate both. The reas=\r\non that meditation systems prescribe things like\n&gt; vegetarian diet, ahimsa,=\r\n etc. is because an inappropriate lifestyle\n&gt; interferes with the mental tr=\r\nanquility required to advance. This lifestyle\n&gt; change can be appreciated r=\r\negardless of whether one believes in a personal\n&gt; God or not. This absence =\r\nof a personal God is clear in Buddhist meditation.\n&gt; Different Hindu system=\r\ns place different levels of emphasis upon a personal\n&gt; God for the yoga to =\r\nfunction. This is why many secular and scientifically\n&gt; minded persons are =\r\nalso drawn towards meditation techniques. In other words,\n&gt; something canno=\r\nt be a science if it depends upon morality, because science\n&gt; is objective =\r\nand stands independent of morality.\n&gt;\n&gt; The relevance of this question is a=\r\ns follows: Many persons who have learned\n&gt; advanced meditation from Swami N=\r\nithyananda want to know if any moral\n&gt; breaches by him would invalidate the=\r\n whole Hindu claim of achieving higher\n&gt; states of consciousness. When a fa=\r\nr worse sex scandal against the legendary\n&gt; Swami Muktananda emerged in the=\r\n 1990s, involving charges by a large number\n&gt; of his Western female discipl=\r\nes, the Western academy rashly condemned not\n&gt; only one man&#39;s morality, but=\r\n also the whole legitimacy of the Indian\n&gt; tradition itself. In that series=\r\n of debates (with RISA scholars like Sarah\n&gt; Caldwell, etc.), I took the sa=\r\nme position then as I am taking now: that\n&gt; Muktananda&#39;s capabilities in ha=\r\nrnessing spiritual energies are separate and\n&gt; independent from whether or =\r\nnot he violated any code of morality.\n&gt;\n&gt; Patanjali warns against getting l=\r\nured by siddhis which appear along the way\n&gt; when one practices advanced me=\r\nditation persistently. One is not supposed to\n&gt; indulge in them. This warni=\r\nng is found in various Hindu systems that deal\n&gt; with the body as a vehicle=\r\n for spiritual evolution, because these energies\n&gt; are very powerful and ca=\r\nn get out of control. Another point that is worth\n&gt; noting is that the tech=\r\nniques taught by Swami Nithyananda are not his\n&gt; original ones; he has made=\r\n it clear repeatedly that they are from the Shiva\n&gt; Sutras which have a lon=\r\ng history in our civilization. I feel that he does\n&gt; have the siddhi of bei=\r\nng able to transmit these techniques very effectively\n&gt; to others. For inst=\r\nance, I have never before in my life been able to sit\n&gt; still and alert in =\r\nmeditation for the whole night, but he had a few hundred\n&gt; persons in a lar=\r\nge hall achieving this. The point here is similar to saying\n&gt; that the math=\r\nematics and golf I have learned from someone is not invalidated\n&gt; when the =\r\nteacher is found to be immoral.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hence, the issue of his morality must b=\r\ne pursued separately and\n&gt; independently from whether his siddhis are genui=\r\nne.\n&gt;\n&gt; Is Tantra a Part of Hinduism?\n&gt;\n&gt; The second question that I asked =\r\nSri Sri could not be completely dealt with\n&gt; in the time available for our =\r\nmeeting. I hope to pursue this some day with\n&gt; him and with various other a=\r\ncharyas for my own benefit. Its significance in\n&gt; the present scandal becom=\r\nes clear soon. I asked whether the Shiva Sutras are\n&gt; valid, pointing out t=\r\nhat among the 112 spiritual enlightenment techniques\n&gt; taught in them, abou=\r\nt 6 deal with sexual contact between a male yogi and a\n&gt; female yogini. Kas=\r\nhmir Shaivism as well as the Tantra traditions have\n&gt; included exemplars th=\r\nat practiced these techniques. Recently, Osho tried to\n&gt; revive them and no=\r\nwadays Deepak Chopra has brought some elements of these\n&gt; into his repertoi=\r\nre. Sunthar Visuvalingam, a US based scholar of Tantra and\n&gt; Kashmir Shaivi=\r\nsm, is one of the voices who brings out the authenticity of\n&gt; these approac=\r\nhes in the tradition, despite the common rejections by society\n&gt; at large. =\r\nThe tradition considers itself not suitable for mainstream society\n&gt; and is=\r\n meant only for a small subset of people.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many popular Hindu rituals an=\r\nd symbols have emerged out of the Tantra\n&gt; traditions =96 such as Shiva lin=\r\ngam, etc. The Tantra and Vedic traditions were\n&gt; not separate until recent =\r\ntimes. The Vedic-Tantric integration is found in\n&gt; Adi Shankara all the way=\r\n to Jiva Goswami (the great integrator of\n&gt; Vaishnavism who took Ramanuja&#39;s=\r\n ideas further), and even more recently in\n&gt; the life of Sri Ramakrishna. T=\r\nhe Bihar School of Yoga has Tantra\n&gt; practitioners, but they do it privatel=\r\ny and not publicly.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have an unpublished monograph that shows the hist=\r\nory of this shift in\n&gt; Indian consciousness concerning Tantra. It was under=\r\n British rule that\n&gt; certain Indian leaders (such as Ram Mohan Roy) started=\r\n to condemn (as part\n&gt; of their &quot;reform&quot; of Hinduism) those aspects of Hind=\r\nuism that bothered\n&gt; puritan Christian values. It must be noted that Christ=\r\nianity has had a very\n&gt; negative posture towards the human body starting wi=\r\nth the Biblical episode\n&gt; of Origin Sin. This is why female priests (called=\r\n &quot;witches&quot;) got demonized\n&gt; by the Church in its very official genocide of =\r\nseveral million practitioners\n&gt; across Europe. This Church prosecution was =\r\ncalled the Inquisition and was\n&gt; widespread for a few centuries. The use of=\r\n shakti and anything concerning\n&gt; the body as a spiritual resource was cons=\r\nidered not only immoral but also\n&gt; demonic, and was outlawed with draconian=\r\n enforcement. The term &quot;occult&quot; was\n&gt; used to refer to a vast assortment of=\r\n such practices and was heavily\n&gt; condemned by the Church as the work of th=\r\ne Devil.\n&gt; This mentality entered India under the British. The Criminal Tri=\r\nbes Act of\n&gt; India was passed by the British in the late 1800s. It listed s=\r\neveral dozen\n&gt; tribes that practiced such &quot;evil&quot; techniques, and they were =\r\nofficially\n&gt; persecuted into extinction. A middle-class &quot;whitened&quot; Hinduism=\r\n evolved as\n&gt; the mark of being &quot;civilized&quot; on British terms. We could thus=\r\n be proud of\n&gt; our identity, now that it was &quot;cleansed&quot; of &quot;primitive&quot; prac=\r\ntices of our\n&gt; ancestors.\n&gt;\n&gt; In this history of removing Tantra out of Hin=\r\nduism, some people include\n&gt; Swami Vivekananda among those who undermined T=\r\nantra. I disagree with this\n&gt; charge. He was saying a separate set of thing=\r\ns to his Western audiences than\n&gt; to Indians. In his Western lecture tours,=\r\n he presented a Hinduism that\n&gt; Westerners could relate to and appreciate, =\r\nbut he did not ask Indians to\n&gt; shift their practice. It is unfortunate tha=\r\nt after his death, the\n&gt; Ramakrishna Mission he started has diluted itself =\r\ninto a sort of\n&gt; pseudo-Christianity. Kali and other related Tantra deities=\r\n, symbols and\n&gt; rituals that were dear to Ramakrishna himself, have become =\r\n&quot;hidden&quot; for the\n&gt; &quot;private&quot; use by the monks, but are marginalized publicl=\r\ny and considered as\n&gt; an embarrassment. Their lead in this direction has sp=\r\nread across modern\n&gt; Hinduism to such an extent that Vedic Hinduism has bec=\r\nome separated from\n&gt; Tantra, and Tantra is now widely condemned by many Hin=\r\ndu gurus. This is also\n&gt; a factor that worked against Swami Nithyananda&#39;s r=\r\neputation among orthodox\n&gt; Hindu leaders, for he uses Tantric techniques th=\r\nat arouse body energies,\n&gt; such as kundalini.\n&gt;\n&gt; My own feeling is that Ta=\r\nntra is making a big comeback. First there was\n&gt; Western popularity of dist=\r\norted versions of Tantra; but this is now being\n&gt; followed by more clinical=\r\n experimentation by psychologists and others. The\n&gt; whole issue of latent h=\r\numan energies and potentials (both positive and\n&gt; dangerous) is a hot topic=\r\n of serious scientific investigation. Hindus should\n&gt; reclaim this aspect o=\r\nf their own tradition rather than waiting for U-Turned\n&gt; (appropriated) ver=\r\nsions to get re-exported back to India, packaged as &quot;Made\n&gt; in USA&quot; spiritu=\r\nal science. This requires an attitude of experimentation\n&gt; under the approp=\r\nriate controls to prevent abuses and quackery.\n&gt;\n&gt; I just returned from Kum=\r\nbh Mela where I walked amidst several tens of\n&gt; thousands of naga sadhus wh=\r\no were completely naked. I did not consider them\n&gt; as either vulgar or prim=\r\nitive. The old guard of Hindu orthodoxy rejects\n&gt; Tantra at least in public=\r\n, and yet lives in contradictions because they do\n&gt; respect the naga sadhus=\r\n and also the various symbols and rituals that have\n&gt; their foundations in =\r\nTantra. The vacuum left by avoiding the subject of\n&gt; Tantra has created opp=\r\nortunities for the likes of Wendy Doniger to formulate\n&gt; distorted interpre=\r\ntations. I feel that Hindu spiritual practitioners as well\n&gt; as intellectua=\r\nls must take back control over Tantra as an intrinsic part of\n&gt; our traditi=\r\non.\n&gt;\n&gt; Sex and Morality\n&gt;\n&gt; Against this backdrop, I will address the issu=\r\ne of Swami Nithyananda&#39;s\n&gt; morality. Just to recap:\n&gt; My first point above =\r\nhas been that the morality issue about Swami\n&gt; Nithyananda does not impact =\r\nthe effectiveness of the meditation techniques\n&gt; he has taught very success=\r\nfully. Their efficacy is best evaluated by the\n&gt; tens of thousands of pract=\r\nitioners for themselves.\n&gt; My second point was that there is nothing inhere=\r\nnt about sex that is\n&gt; rejected by Hinduism across the board, although cert=\r\nain strains of Hinduism\n&gt; do reject sex seeing it as harmful to spiritualit=\r\ny.\n&gt; Here it must be noted that brahmacharya (involving sexual abstinence) =\r\nis\n&gt; just one of the spiritual paths of Hinduism. The first half of my rece=\r\nnt\n&gt; stay in Haridwar was as a guest of the Gayatri Pariwar, one of the gre=\r\natest\n&gt; and largest Hindu movements, that does not advocate being brahmacha=\r\nri. Its\n&gt; founder, its present head and its members at large, are household=\r\ners and not\n&gt; brahmacharis. But for Swami Nithyananda to claim moral authen=\r\nticity under\n&gt; this system, he would have to pronounce himself as a househo=\r\nlder and not a\n&gt; sannyasin. He has never done that, so we must examine his =\r\nmorality by some\n&gt; other criteria.\n&gt;\n&gt; Another approach for him could have =\r\nbeen to announce himself as an\n&gt; experimenter of Tantra for modern times, t=\r\nhereby making himself transparent\n&gt; of any such charges. This would place h=\r\nim in the same category as Osho. Many\n&gt; times in his public discourses and =\r\nteachings, he has praised Osho as his\n&gt; greatest teacher and enlightened ex=\r\nemplar. He even said that many of his own\n&gt; teachings were derived from Osh=\r\no. But he failed to publicly clarify whether\n&gt; he was practicing those tech=\r\nniques that involve sex. Privately, he explained\n&gt; to me in recent days tha=\r\nt Shiva Sutras have two categories of techniques.\n&gt; Most of the sutras do n=\r\not involve physical contact with another person and\n&gt; only use the four sen=\r\nses of sight, sound, taste and smell as pathways to\n&gt; spiritual experiences=\r\n. Hence an individual practices these techniques\n&gt; entirely on his/her own.=\r\n This path is what he has taught thus far to the\n&gt; public. The best pursuit=\r\n of this path is as a brahamachari according to him,\n&gt; and he has initiated=\r\n many followers into it. But for a small number of\n&gt; persons, he feels that=\r\n the 6 sutras involving sexual Tantra need to be\n&gt; tested and perfected for=\r\n modern times, before they can be safely taught more\n&gt; widely. This he cons=\r\niders to be like any R & D done in a lab for developing\n&gt; a product.\n&gt; My s=\r\nense is that he did practice Tantra with a very small number of\n&gt; persons, =\r\nand I believe that he even entered into written legal contracts\n&gt; with them=\r\n to make sure that both parties were clear about the arrangement.\n&gt; The rea=\r\nson for this &quot;Non-Disclosure Agreement&quot; was to make sure that someone\n&gt; who=\r\n willingly approaches him for Tantra does not later accuse him of\n&gt; inappro=\r\npriate physical contact. On March 9 (about a week ago), I did a\n&gt; specific =\r\nvideo interview with him dealing with this issue very specifically.\n&gt; But t=\r\nhis video was blocked by his ashram leaders even though he personally\n&gt; fel=\r\nt that it was a good idea to show it. I gave up arguing in favor of\n&gt; showi=\r\nng it, because his ashram management took a firm stand against it. I\n&gt; stil=\r\nl feel that this was a blunder they made. Swami Nithyananda is very\n&gt; forth=\r\nright and clear in that interview =96 I felt that it was the best\n&gt; intervi=\r\new of all the ones I did with him, but it was never made public.\n&gt; I surmis=\r\ne that Ranjitha, the Tamil actress in the scandalous videotape, was\n&gt; pract=\r\nicing Tantra with him. He taught her the self-control she had to\n&gt; achieve =\r\nbefore any intimacy. I have tried to interview her in order to get\n&gt; her si=\r\nde of the story, but so far I have not succeeded in getting through to\n&gt; he=\r\nr. Based on third party reports from some persons who are in touch with\n&gt; h=\r\ner, and the media reports of her statements, her stance seems to be along\n&gt;=\r\n the following lines: She took the sexual initiative with him on the occasi=\r\non\n&gt; shown in the videotape, at a time when he was not fully alert. But thi=\r\ns\n&gt; activity did not proceed to intercourse. It was terminated. She has als=\r\no\n&gt; said that the videos being shown on TV are manipulated versions of what=\r\n\n&gt; actually happened, because they exaggerate the situation. They do not sh=\r\now\n&gt; portions where he asked her to stop. Different clips from various vide=\r\nos\n&gt; seem to have been turned into a single video by editing. She has not f=\r\niled\n&gt; any complaint against him. So in the worst case, this was consensual=\r\n sex\n&gt; between adults, and that too backed by a formal written contract bet=\r\nween the\n&gt; parties. Because she has refused to give any statement against S=\r\nwami\n&gt; Nithyananda, she feels threatened by those who set her up and who di=\r\nd this\n&gt; sting operation. I hear that she has gone overseas to protect her =\r\nsafety\n&gt; from this mafia-like conspiracy. I have not been able to corrobora=\r\nte this\n&gt; thesis directly from her.\n&gt;\n&gt; My concern about his morality is, t=\r\nherefore, not based on sex between\n&gt; consenting adults. Rather, my moral is=\r\nsue is about the lack of transparency\n&gt; before the public. He could have op=\r\nenly said that he wants to select a few\n&gt; yoginis to experiment Tantra unde=\r\nr mutual consent. At worst this would have\n&gt; upset many followers and pushe=\r\nd them away. In response to my concern over\n&gt; his lack of transparency, he =\r\ncould offer the argument that this was a\n&gt; private activity between adults =\r\nwho are under no obligation to disclose it\n&gt; to the public. After all, peop=\r\nle do not go about broadcasting their sexual\n&gt; lives. So long as this was u=\r\nnder mutual consent, he might say, it cannot be\n&gt; an offense. And if it was=\r\n done under the Tantra portions of the Shiva Sutra,\n&gt; it was also an act wi=\r\nthin the Hindu tradition despite the controversy\n&gt; surrounding Tantra today=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; Having given this best case argument on his behalf, I must say that t=\r\nhere\n&gt; could also be the alternative scenario, namely, that this was mere l=\r\nust\n&gt; packaged as Tantric spirituality. David White, one of Wendy&#39;s Childre=\r\nn, has\n&gt; written extensively making the claim that all Tantra is &quot;hard core=\r\n porn&quot;\n&gt; that gets wrapped up before the public in metaphysical mumbo-jumbo=\r\n to appear\n&gt; to be legitimate spirituality, which he calls &quot;soft porn&quot; coat=\r\ning. White&#39;s\n&gt; latest book takes this allegation to the extreme, and states=\r\n that all major\n&gt; yogic exemplars in Indian history were basically not enga=\r\nged in any kind of\n&gt; spirituality at all. Instead, he claims, they were dev=\r\neloping personal power\n&gt; for the purpose of exploiting others. I am unquali=\r\nfied to comment on whether\n&gt; Swami Nithyananda&#39;s case fits this notion of &quot;=\r\nsoft porn,&quot; or whether it was\n&gt; legitimate Tantra. Nor do I have adequate f=\r\nactual data of what happened to\n&gt; pass judgment either way.\n&gt; This conclude=\r\ns what I have to say about his morality issue as shown in the\n&gt; sex tapes.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; My Impressions of Swami Nithyananda Prior to this Scandal\n&gt; I was intro=\r\nduced to Swami Nithyananda a couple of years ago, by a prominent\n&gt; Hindu le=\r\nader based in California. This man was so impressed by the young\n&gt; swami th=\r\nat he frequently called me to speak about him in glowing terms. I\n&gt; told hi=\r\nm that I had a guru already, and that my present interest in\n&gt; interacting =\r\nwith gurus was mainly as a part of my research for my book on\n&gt; global guru=\r\ns. He arranged a private meeting for me with Swami Nithyananda,\n&gt; which I u=\r\nsed mostly to explain the civilization threats facing Hinduism,\n&gt; citing nu=\r\nmerous examples, and questioned him on his position in this regard.\n&gt; I fou=\r\nnd him to be very sharp, a great listener, and in agreement that we\n&gt; must =\r\nengage social issues rather than pursuing the &quot;world negating&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;escapi=\r\nst&quot; paths that are typical of many gurus today.\n&gt; Later on, I attended a we=\r\nekend course in USA where he taught the Patanjali\n&gt; Yoga Sutras. I have rea=\r\nd several translations of this great classical work,\n&gt; but I had never befo=\r\nre seen it taught experientially. Swami Nithyananda gave\n&gt; the attendees th=\r\neir own personal inner experience of every one of the eight\n&gt; limbs of Pata=\r\nnjali&#39;s system, right up to and including samadhi. This was\n&gt; quite an achi=\r\nevement in two days.\n&gt;\n&gt; Overall, my interactions with him remained centere=\r\nd largely on the\n&gt; geopolitics of religions. I saw him as a prominent swami=\r\n who was not running\n&gt; away from troubling issues, such as Christian conver=\r\nsions and the\n&gt; Dravidianization of Tamil identity. Given that I have been =\r\nwriting a book\n&gt; for three years (now in the editing stage) on this very is=\r\nsue as it exists\n&gt; in Tamil Nadu, I was especially impressed by his experim=\r\nental program of a\n&gt; Hindu temple on wheels traveling from village to villa=\r\nge. In each village\n&gt; this mobile temple stops and offers chanting, a talk =\r\nby one of the leaders,\n&gt; food, medicines, etc. So it combines religion with=\r\n social service and thus\n&gt; competes directly against Christian evangelism. =\r\nRather than building a\n&gt; temple in every village and needing a purohit in e=\r\nach of the thousands of\n&gt; villages across Tamil Nadu, the strategy was to b=\r\nring to each village this\n&gt; &quot;temple on wheels.&quot; What I discovered by my own=\r\n independent fact-finding was\n&gt; that wherever this temple on wheels went, t=\r\nhe missionaries were upset\n&gt; because it blunted their conversion efforts.\n&gt;=\r\n I attended his 21-day meditation program in December 2009. The various\n&gt; t=\r\nechniques in it are very deep and transformative. The best evaluation of\n&gt; =\r\nthis can be done by the hundreds of attendees, who were divided roughly\n&gt; e=\r\nqually between Indians and whites from North America.\n&gt;\n&gt; In several side c=\r\nonversations with him as well in the public forum, I\n&gt; pursued the point th=\r\nat I already have a guru since 1994, so I was not\n&gt; looking for a new guru.=\r\n Since my guru had left the body a few years ago, I\n&gt; wanted to continue le=\r\narning new techniques for my practice. I explained to\n&gt; him that I had prev=\r\niously learned and practiced meditation techniques from\n&gt; multiple sources =\r\nfor over 30 years, including: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Sri\n&gt; Sri Ravi Shankar=\r\n, Yogi Amrit Desai (who certified me as a teacher), Deepak\n&gt; Chopra, Vipass=\r\nana, and more. Additionally, I had practiced numerous bhakti\n&gt; traditions, =\r\nas well as formal Vedanta education from Swami Chinmayananda and\n&gt; Ramakris=\r\nhna Mission. I went through a serious study of the writings by Sri\n&gt; Aurobi=\r\nndo, various Madhyamika Buddhist systems, Kashmir Shaivism, Ramana\n&gt; Mahars=\r\nhi, etc. So I was not seeking a new guru like most others who took his\n&gt; co=\r\nurses.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have to say that he never pressured me to adopt him as my new =\r\nguru, and\n&gt; even said that one must remain loyal to one&#39;s guru. To be class=\r\nified as a\n&gt; devotee/disciple of his, there are two criteria, neither of wh=\r\nich applies to\n&gt; me. First, there is an optional program one can sign up fo=\r\nr, to do &quot;paada\n&gt; puja&quot; at the guru&#39;s feet, in order to develop a special l=\r\nink with him. The\n&gt; second is that one can ask to be given an initiation wi=\r\nth a new name, in\n&gt; which case his policy is that the person must legally c=\r\nhange his/her name,\n&gt; and use this new name publicly. I did not do either o=\r\nf these steps. So my\n&gt; relationship is not as a devotee or disciple, but mo=\r\nre arms-length.\n&gt;\n&gt; It was a two-way street. While he taught me meditation,=\r\n I brought to him my\n&gt; scholarship on the geopolitical positioning of Hindu=\r\nism which I feel the\n&gt; gurus know only superficially. They do not adequatel=\r\ny know things like:\n&gt; Western philosophy, neither of the religious nor the =\r\nsecular variety; or\n&gt; Western history; or Western institutions that have be=\r\nen set up explicitly to\n&gt; spread its civilization; or various global campai=\r\ngns under way to invade\n&gt; Indian civilization through conversions, educatio=\r\nn, media, political\n&gt; policymaking and more.\n&gt;\n&gt; He requested that I should=\r\n present him my findings on such matters so that\n&gt; he and his senior achary=\r\nas could learn. I told him that most gurus have\n&gt; little time to listen att=\r\nentively to a layperson like me, because the gurus\n&gt; like to do all the tal=\r\nking. He replied that he would sit and listen to me\n&gt; seriously. I made it =\r\nclear that I was disinterested in giving a short talk\n&gt; of a few minutes, b=\r\necause my findings required considerable time to be\n&gt; examined seriously. I=\r\n told him that I would need two full days of undivided\n&gt; attention, so that=\r\n I could present 300 Powerpoint slides.\n&gt;\n&gt; Swami Nithyananda sent me an in=\r\nvitation when I was in Delhi to visit his\n&gt; ashram and present my research.=\r\n I was delighted to have such an important\n&gt; audience. I was very impressed=\r\n by the fact that he sat through two long days\n&gt; of my talks, about 12 hour=\r\ns per day. He asked his 40 top acharyas and\n&gt; various thought leaders in hi=\r\ns ashram to sit and listen to me for both the\n&gt; days. The interactions were=\r\n intense, and I explained many points from my\n&gt; forthcoming books. I felt t=\r\nhat he and I had a peer relationship, each side\n&gt; being an expert in his do=\r\nmain to teach the other. After my two days of talks\n&gt; were over, he asked m=\r\ne to help him incorporate my core ideas into his\n&gt; curriculum, so as to mak=\r\ne sure that his teachings helped position the Vedic\n&gt; civilization properly=\r\n.\n&gt;\n&gt; No other guru in the world has invested so much time with me to try a=\r\nnd\n&gt; learn these global issues so deeply. (The only other prominent guru I =\r\nknow\n&gt; personally who understands these issues about the external challenge=\r\ns is\n&gt; Swami Dayananda Saraswati.) Most gurus tend to either be dismissive =\r\nby\n&gt; resorting to spiritual loftiness, or imagine that they already know wh=\r\natever\n&gt; there is worth knowing. Thus, my primary interest in Swami Nithyan=\r\nanda was\n&gt; as a vehicle to spread greater awareness of the kinds of issues =\r\nthat I was\n&gt; researching. (For instance, he bought a couple of hundred copi=\r\nes of the\n&gt; book, &quot;Invading the Sacred&quot; at the full price, and made it requ=\r\nired reading\n&gt; for all his ashram residents.)\n&gt;\n&gt; I must balance this prais=\r\ne with criticism. In my 2-day talks, I had\n&gt; explicitly discussed that many=\r\n gurus were falling prey to sex scandals,\n&gt; often with women planted as par=\r\nt of sting operations, or women in the inner\n&gt; circle who got too close and=\r\n let things get out of control. Despite these\n&gt; warnings, it seems that not=\r\nhing concrete was done to prevent or at least\n&gt; anticipate the crisis that =\r\nwas to follow.\n&gt;\n&gt; My Approach to this Investigation\n&gt;\n&gt; When the scandal b=\r\nroke out I was in Delhi. I called the Bangalore ashram\n&gt; management and fou=\r\nnd them confident but confused. Probably they felt that\n&gt; the matter would =\r\nsoon get forgotten if left alone. But exactly the opposite\n&gt; happened, as e=\r\nach day brought fresh allegations and sensational media\n&gt; coverage. After s=\r\neveral days had passed I was invited to go to Bangalore to\n&gt; study the situ=\r\nation for myself. At that time I had no clue about his Tantra\n&gt; practice wi=\r\nth any women. Whatever I knew was based on what his followers\n&gt; told me, be=\r\ncause he was personally inaccessible for several days even after\n&gt; I reache=\r\nd Bangalore. I spent many hours daily with some of his ashram&#39;s top\n&gt; team.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; What I wrote earlier in this article actually comes later in the chron=\r\nology\n&gt; of my investigation. But I presented it up front because most reade=\r\nrs are\n&gt; obsessed with getting my answer to only one single question: did h=\r\ne or did\n&gt; he not have sex? Nothing else seems to matter to them, whereas m=\r\ny\n&gt; investigation&#39;s emphasis has been about issues broader and more\n&gt; conse=\r\nquential than any one man&#39;s morality.\n&gt;\n&gt; Until I concluded my fact-finding=\r\n 2-week period recently, I was unable to\n&gt; discuss the sexual acts shown in=\r\n the videotapes. I had to respect the\n&gt; policies of his people as part of t=\r\nhe trust being placed in me to gain\n&gt; access. They also needed legal cleara=\r\nnce on what can and cannot be said by\n&gt; them. Their policy on the sex tapes=\r\n was that Swami Nithyananda would\n&gt; directly explain his acts. The Tamil ac=\r\ntress&#39; lawyer was also in contact\n&gt; with them and her sensitivities had to =\r\nbe respected. The sensitivities of\n&gt; the 140-strong ashramites had to be pr=\r\notected also. Given this set of\n&gt; circumstances facing me, I feel that it w=\r\nas unfair to demand that I should\n&gt; hound him with the one critical questio=\r\nn. People have assumed that it was up\n&gt; to me to decide what would be withi=\r\nn the scope of each interview. As I have\n&gt; mentioned earlier, even after ce=\r\nrtain interviews were recorded by me, the\n&gt; ashram leadership used its disc=\r\nretion not to air them.\n&gt;\n&gt; In response to my critics on how I conducted my=\r\n interviews, I would also\n&gt; like to explain why I chose to focus on the cri=\r\nminal charges being made\n&gt; against Swami Nithyananda. Besides the sex-tape =\r\nbeing off limits as\n&gt; mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, the criminal ch=\r\narges became my focus\n&gt; for two reasons. These charges could be ascertained=\r\n with objectivity =96 such\n&gt; as asking for documents on the land ownership,=\r\n the medical reports on the\n&gt; death of one meditation participant 2 years a=\r\ngo, and so forth. The evidence\n&gt; was more clear-cut than the evidence on wh=\r\nat exactly happened in the\n&gt; videotapes between two persons none of whom we=\r\nre willing to talk with me\n&gt; about it. Secondly, the consequences of crimin=\r\nality would be far more severe\n&gt; than mere moral fallibility. While immoral=\r\n conduct is a big concern for the\n&gt; devotees, it is not enough grounds by i=\r\ntself for the state to confiscate the\n&gt; entire property that runs into very=\r\n large sums of money. Also, as a matter\n&gt; of principle, regardless of wheth=\r\ner or not he is guilty of the morality\n&gt; charge, I felt opposed to spurious=\r\n criminal charges being piled up by the\n&gt; irresponsible media just to creat=\r\ne sensationalism.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Conspiracy against Swami Nithyananda\n&gt;\n&gt; Since I =\r\nhad arrived at the scene while writing my book on the conspiracy in\n&gt; Tamil=\r\n Nadu religious politics, it was natural to start with that as my\n&gt; emphasi=\r\ns for the investigation. But in this short article I have decided to\n&gt; focu=\r\ns on the matters surrounding his conduct and his organization&#39;s conduct,\n&gt; =\r\nbecause these have assumed a more urgent nature. The details of the\n&gt; consp=\r\niracy belong in my book as corroborating evidence for my thesis there.\n&gt; Th=\r\ne types of parties reported to be behind the conspiracy, both foreign and\n&gt;=\r\n India based, were remarkably similar to the ones I have written about in t=\r\nhe\n&gt; book. So for now I shall merely summarize some of the main points conc=\r\nerning\n&gt; this conspiracy.\n&gt;\n&gt; First one must understand why Swami Nithyanan=\r\nda became such a target. He\n&gt; was virtually unknown 7 years ago, but once h=\r\ne appeared in public his\n&gt; popularity catapulted at a dramatic rate. For ex=\r\nample, last year, YouTube\n&gt; wrote to him that he was the most watched of al=\r\nl Indian spiritual leaders on\n&gt; the Internet and proposed a closer collabor=\r\nation for their viewers. This\n&gt; letter also stated that among all spiritual=\r\n leaders worldwide (not just\n&gt; Indian) he was the second most popular one, =\r\nthe Vatican being first. His\n&gt; meditation programs have become very popular=\r\n in USA and in certain Indian\n&gt; states. The main factors are that participa=\r\nnts almost invariably report\n&gt; experiencing higher states of consciousness,=\r\n and he has healed a large\n&gt; number of persons of a variety of diseases. Hi=\r\ns healing powers are what\n&gt; brought together his core inner group of devote=\r\nes from around the world =96\n&gt; doctors, businessmen, IT professionals, corp=\r\norate executives. Many of them\n&gt; have explained their personal healings fro=\r\nm terminal illnesses as the\n&gt; turning point in their lives. His meditation =\r\nprograms sometimes bring up to\n&gt; a few thousand attendees for periods rangi=\r\nng from a few days to several\n&gt; weeks.\n&gt;\n&gt; While the funds come mostly from=\r\n upper strata participants in India and\n&gt; USA, a large portion of the expen=\r\nses have been allocated to develop\n&gt; grass-roots social and spiritual progr=\r\nams focusing primarily in Tamil Nadu,\n&gt; his native state. This is where he =\r\nis seen as a threat by Dravidian as well\n&gt; as Christian forces. For instanc=\r\ne, in December 2009, about 600 villages\n&gt; across Tamil Nadu sent their loca=\r\nl &quot;Nithyananda leaders&quot; for a celebration\n&gt; and planning session in his mai=\r\nn ashram near Bangalore. I happened to be\n&gt; present for the event. These co=\r\nmmon folks, mostly from the lower strata of\n&gt; Tamil society, had walked 300=\r\n kilometers for this journey, which they saw as\n&gt; a spiritual pilgrimage. T=\r\nhe reason for the anger of Christian and Dravidian\n&gt; forces is that his act=\r\nivities have put a dampener to conversions in many\n&gt; districts, and several=\r\n Christians have returned to Hinduism by getting\n&gt; initiated formally into =\r\nhis organization. The swami himself has spoken\n&gt; against conversions, and h=\r\nas also stated that the Dravidian movement had\n&gt; made Tamil people unspirit=\r\nual in their lives, and that this had caused\n&gt; social decay. His Tamil lang=\r\nuage publications and courses have become his\n&gt; most popular ones, far exce=\r\neding the numbers in English. Also he is a very\n&gt; big threat because he is =\r\nnot a Brahmin. Because he cannot be targeted using\n&gt; the classic attack str=\r\nategies used on Brahmins, and because the masses in\n&gt; Tamil Nadu were risin=\r\ng to swell his ranks, the threat he posed to the\n&gt; existing political power=\r\n structure had to be stopped one way or another.\n&gt;\n&gt; The attack against Swa=\r\nmi Nithyananda has consisted of two prongs,\n&gt; destroying his image and alle=\r\nging legal misdeeds. At first a highly\n&gt; sensational sexual charge was broa=\r\ndcast in order to devastate his\n&gt; credibility and create an atmosphere in w=\r\nhich any and all kinds of\n&gt; outlandish allegations would be taken at face v=\r\nalue. Once the media and\n&gt; popular sentiments had been turned against him, =\r\nthere was one amazing\n&gt; allegation after another in rapid sequence. It was =\r\nclear that none of this\n&gt; was spontaneous but was being centrally orchestra=\r\nted under a systematic\n&gt; plan.\n&gt;\n&gt; What became evident to me was that there=\r\n was &quot;cooperation&quot; in informal and\n&gt; unofficial ways among the media, polic=\r\ne and lower level judiciary. In fact,\n&gt; many third parties were aware of th=\r\ne attack in advance and had warned his\n&gt; people before it happened with spe=\r\ncific details of the plan. For instance,\n&gt; one of his top devotees got a ph=\r\none call from someone based in New York\n&gt; describing the media and police a=\r\nttack that was to come. His predictions\n&gt; turned out to be accurate but at =\r\nthat time the ashramites did not take the\n&gt; threat literally. He said that =\r\nfor the right sum of money he could be\n&gt; helpful in preventing such an atta=\r\nck. He claimed that the planning for this\n&gt; attack had started a year ago. =\r\nHe mentioned that a budget of Rs 200 crores\n&gt; was allocated by some oversea=\r\ns groups to demolish Hindu gurus especially in\n&gt; south India, and named two=\r\n south Indian churches as the nodal agencies to\n&gt; coordinate this strategic=\r\n plan. (I am presently pursuing these leads as part\n&gt; of my book investigat=\r\nion.)\n&gt; There was another concrete extortion effort about eleven or twelve =\r\ndays\n&gt; prior to the scandal breaking out. A lawyer contacted them and claim=\r\ned that\n&gt; his client had compromising videos, and that the client was seeki=\r\nng money or\n&gt; else they would get released. The same intermediary later sen=\r\nt a letter\n&gt; containing a variety of unsubstantiated criminal allegations a=\r\ngainst Swami\n&gt; Nithyananda, and this letter&#39;s distribution list included In=\r\ndia&#39;s Prime\n&gt; Minister, President, Sonya Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, various C=\r\nhief Ministers\n&gt; and police heads, various national criminal investigation =\r\nand security\n&gt; organizations. I have a copy of this letter, and it makes th=\r\ne Nithyananda\n&gt; organization seem like a terrorist outfit that needs to be =\r\nattacked for the\n&gt; sake of public safety. This letter along with a DVD of t=\r\nhe sex video was\n&gt; delivered to the Chief Minister of Karnataka state two h=\r\nours before the\n&gt; videotape was first aired. Clearly, the attack was well p=\r\nlanned and executed\n&gt; across many locations, and was persistently carried o=\r\nut over several days.\n&gt; This is not the work of some isolated individuals.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; There were warnings given to individuals in the ashram that their phone=\r\ns\n&gt; were being tapped and that they better leave to save their own lives,\n&gt;=\r\n because something horrible was about to happen. One friendly man based in\n=\r\n&gt; Pune who runs a magazine and is a devotee of Swami Nithyananda, told the\n=\r\n&gt; ashram a week in advance of the attack that some such catastrophe would\n&gt;=\r\n happen. He named his source as a man in the Bangalore Press Club. Another\n=\r\n&gt; publisher in Hyderabad who distributes Swami Nithyananda&#39;s books in Telug=\r\nu,\n&gt; called three times to warn that a graphic video would be released and =\r\ngave a\n&gt; precise time for this to happen. It was also reported that an Amer=\r\nican\n&gt; devotee who had fallen out of the ashram was working in association =\r\nwith one\n&gt; Jody Razdik who specializes in guru bashing at a prominent web s=\r\nite. He was\n&gt; being helped by an Indian based in San Diego, who was once ve=\r\nry deeply\n&gt; involved inside the Nithyananda organization but had turned mal=\r\nicious. The\n&gt; only man who has openly come out as the main accuser was an a=\r\nshramite who\n&gt; had a falling out when he got demoted due to his conduct. It=\r\n was recently\n&gt; reported that he had a prior criminal record against him bu=\r\nt nobody in the\n&gt; ashram had checked out his background before admitting hi=\r\nm.\n&gt;\n&gt; There were constant threats received to harass the ashramites and sc=\r\nare\n&gt; them away, with claims that &quot;narcotics will be planted to cause arres=\r\nt\n&gt; warrants.&quot; The actions by the police were being leaked to the media ahe=\r\nad of\n&gt; time and even to the opposing side, leading to numerous &quot;tips&quot; rece=\r\nived by\n&gt; &quot;friends&quot; asking the ashram dwellers to run away before &quot;the atta=\r\nck comes.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; But even after a couple of weeks since the scandal has erupt=\r\ned, the lawyers\n&gt; for Swami Nithyananda&#39;s ashram have failed to get copies =\r\nof any concrete\n&gt; charges filed with the police, except a few trivial ones.=\r\n Each time they\n&gt; approach for specific details they are told that there is=\r\n no formal charge,\n&gt; except relatively minor ones. So the intimidation has =\r\nbeen carried out\n&gt; mainly through media reports, without any legal due proc=\r\ness starting where\n&gt; facts and arguments could get cross-examined. This lac=\r\nk of formal charges\n&gt; has enabled an atmosphere of intimidation using rumor=\r\ns and threats that\n&gt; cannot be pinned down officially.\n&gt;\n&gt; It is important =\r\nto contrast this with the manner in which Indian media\n&gt; treats scandals fa=\r\ncing Islamic or Christian groups. The numerous scandals\n&gt; occurring oversea=\r\ns often get blocked by Indian media entirely, or are given\n&gt; mild treatment=\r\n with tremendous sensitivity, in order to be seen as &quot;secular&quot;\n&gt; and not &quot;c=\r\nommunal.&quot; By contrast every kind of allegation against any Hindu\n&gt; group ge=\r\nts clubbed in one homogeneous category and treated as a social\n&gt; scourge eq=\r\nuivalent to terror groups.\n&gt;\n&gt; The media&#39;s hounding mentality and mafia tac=\r\ntics deserve to be condemned.\n&gt; In the Swami Nithyananda case, they have us=\r\ned carrots and sticks to lure and\n&gt; threaten, using whatever would get them=\r\n more sensational footage. Several TV\n&gt; stations and journalists camped out=\r\n in Haridwar and sent me emails\n&gt; requesting my help in arranging an interv=\r\niew. When I failed to deliver\n&gt; (because it was not up to me to deliver any=\r\n such thing), some of them turned\n&gt; nasty against me. One TV woman promised=\r\n the swami&#39;s people &quot;positive&quot;\n&gt; coverage if she got an exclusive. But afte=\r\nr the interview, she betrayed them\n&gt; and turned it into more distortion and=\r\n smut. This led Swami Nithyananda&#39;s\n&gt; handlers to give interviews to more s=\r\ntations in order to counteract this\n&gt; distortion. But the more they said be=\r\nfore TV cameras, the worse the scandal\n&gt; became. One station was blatant in=\r\n its threat to the swami&#39;s assistant: &quot;If\n&gt; you don&#39;t give us an interview =\r\nright away, we will show you the power of the\n&gt; media to destroy you.&quot; At o=\r\nne point a major TV station also wanted to drag\n&gt; in Ramakrishna Mission wi=\r\nth similar allegations, but someone was able to\n&gt; stop that.\n&gt;\n&gt; Failures o=\r\nf Swami Nithyananda&#39;s Organization\n&gt;\n&gt; Hindu tradition separates three kind=\r\ns of Varna (skills), each representing\n&gt; a form of social capital, and thes=\r\ne three were never supposed to be\n&gt; concentrated in a single person, thereb=\r\ny preventing too much concentration\n&gt; of power. I use the terms Brahmin, Ks=\r\nhatriya and Vaishya not as birth based\n&gt; &quot;caste,&quot; but as merit based social=\r\n capital and areas of competence. The\n&gt; Brahmin job description focuses on =\r\nspirituality and research; Kshatriya on\n&gt; governance, politics and leadersh=\r\nip; and Vaishyas on commerce and financial\n&gt; capital. Swami Nithyananda had=\r\n persons with Brahmin qualities performing\n&gt; duties that demand Kshatriya a=\r\nnd Vaishya skills. This was counterproductive.\n&gt; The ashram leaders were se=\r\nlected and trained for skills and roles that are\n&gt; very different than this=\r\n situation demands. Too often their bhakti and\n&gt; spiritual practice substit=\r\nuted for professional competence in managing a\n&gt; rapidly growing global ent=\r\nerprise. The sole emphasis was placed on\n&gt; traditional Brahmin qualities, a=\r\nnd none on what would be considered\n&gt; Kshatriya qualities.\n&gt; For example, t=\r\nhere are a large number of white devotees who do have\n&gt; Kshatriyata - leade=\r\nrship expertise, courage and commitment. But even after\n&gt; this attack the a=\r\nshram organization has blundered in its failure to leverage\n&gt; and deploy th=\r\nem. I met some of these Westerners at the Kumbh and found them\n&gt; remarkably=\r\n willing to stand up for their guru, but nobody had bothered to\n&gt; organize =\r\nthem and take advantage of the fact that Swami Nithyananda has a\n&gt; global f=\r\nollowing. Instead of such initiatives to deal with the crisis, his\n&gt; organi=\r\nzation was in utter chaos, reacting to each &quot;hit&quot; by the other side.\n&gt; Its =\r\nleaders were running scared, driven by one rumor after another.\n&gt; Decisions=\r\n were being made in desperation and panic. The group was\n&gt; cognitively diso=\r\nriented and many of its members were psychologically\n&gt; breaking down.\n&gt;\n&gt; T=\r\nhe organization was too much of a one-man show with the leaders operating\n&gt;=\r\n like children dependent on the swami for every decision. The swami had\n&gt; b=\r\necome the iconic object of the ashram&#39;s inner circle. Their proximity to\n&gt; =\r\nhim became their measure of personal power and identity. This is classical\n=\r\n&gt; cult-like behavior that cannot survive the onslaughts that are inevitable=\r\n\n&gt; nowadays. Such a concentration of all varnas into one man not only makes=\r\n an\n&gt; enterprise incompetent, but it also can also get to the leader&#39;s head=\r\n and\n&gt; make him power hungry. Especially when the guru has siddhis, this po=\r\nwer can\n&gt; easily become co-opted by his ego into a dangerous mixture. The r=\r\nesult is\n&gt; that he surrounds himself with sycophants who tell him what he w=\r\nants to\n&gt; hear, and this feedback loop of self glorification turns into gro=\r\nup\n&gt; delusion.\n&gt;\n&gt; I noticed this in the form of the inner circle&#39;s inabili=\r\nty to make common\n&gt; sense judgments, and their misrepresenting the facts to=\r\n their leader by\n&gt; giving him too much &quot;good news.&quot; The result was that the=\r\n honest truth did\n&gt; not come out fast enough to allow pragmatic and realist=\r\nic planning. I had a\n&gt; difficult time to get dependable information, and th=\r\ne stories kept changing\n&gt; not only over time but also between one person an=\r\nd another within the group.\n&gt; I could not tell if there was a cover up and =\r\nif new lies were fabricated to\n&gt; cover prior lies. In such an atmosphere on=\r\ne cannot tell which individuals\n&gt; might have a separate stake and vested in=\r\nterest from the group. Lacking\n&gt; competent Kshatriyas, the swami had not an=\r\nticipated that such a crisis was\n&gt; ever possible, despite the fact that out=\r\nsiders (including myself in my 2-day\n&gt; talks at his ashram) had explained t=\r\no them the threats facing every\n&gt; prominent Hindu mahatma today.\n&gt; While on=\r\n the one hand I blame those in positions of responsibility at the\n&gt; ashram,=\r\n ultimately Swami Nithyananda bears the responsibility as he selected\n&gt; the=\r\nm, defined their roles, evaluated their performance, motivated and\n&gt; superv=\r\nised them very closely. In this regard, his spiritual capabilities had\n&gt; fa=\r\niled to evaluate those very close to him as well as the external reality.\n&gt;=\r\n An enlightened master must do better than this, or else he must not try to=\r\n\n&gt; control everything so personally.\n&gt; I acknowledge that being a global gu=\r\nru is very demanding today, given that\n&gt; one has to represent a very old tr=\r\nadition authentically and yet in a manner\n&gt; that appeals to modern people. =\r\nThis is why Hindu leaders need a crash course\n&gt; on matters that are well be=\r\nyond the traditional education in their own\n&gt; sampradayas (lineages).\n&gt;\n&gt; H=\r\nindu Chaos\n&gt; Swami Nithyananda&#39;s own support base in India has started to d=\r\nistance\n&gt; itself out of self preservation amidst all the rumors and slander=\r\n. His\n&gt; closest supporters were not approached soon enough with his side of=\r\n the\n&gt; story, and by the time they were approached the damage to his credib=\r\nility\n&gt; was already irreversible. They did not want to risk being associate=\r\nd with a\n&gt; &quot;fallen guru.&quot; Many Hindu gurus have started to publicly lash ou=\r\nt against\n&gt; the &quot;fallen godman&quot;; others became silent or neutral publicly, =\r\nwhile\n&gt; offering private sympathy but refusing to stick their necks out.\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; One factor is that the swami&#39;s approach was too conservative for some and=\r\n\n&gt; too liberal for others. It is too filled with deities, symbols and ritua=\r\nls\n&gt; of a very orthodox kind for the aesthetic taste of modern global gurus=\r\n who\n&gt; propagate a whitened, Westernized &quot;clean&quot; Hinduism that is abstract =\r\nand\n&gt; metaphysical but devoid of imagery associated with &quot;primitive paganis=\r\nm.&quot; At\n&gt; the other end of the spectrum are orthodox Hindu leaders who find =\r\nhis idea\n&gt; of youthful dancing, celebration, and liberal atmosphere to be n=\r\not &quot;real&quot;\n&gt; Hinduism. A couple of shankaracharyas interviewed on NDTV lashe=\r\nd out against\n&gt; &quot;false&quot; gurus and claimed that only the shankaracharyas had=\r\n the authority to\n&gt; certify who was qualified to be a guru. So Swami Nithya=\r\nnanda fits neither\n&gt; end of this spectrum.\n&gt;\n&gt; Many of the gurus I met have=\r\n told me in confidence that they fear that\n&gt; similar attacks are coming to =\r\nmore Hindu gurus, but that there is no central\n&gt; Hindu mechanism to deal wi=\r\nth these episodes along the lines of various\n&gt; Church mechanisms that inter=\r\nvene when Christianity faces a scandal. I sent\n&gt; feelers to the Hindu Dharm=\r\na Acharya Sabha as to whether it should offer to\n&gt; step in and take over th=\r\ne ashram and its related organizations, thereby\n&gt; bringing new management t=\r\no clean up matters and bring stability to the\n&gt; enterprise. I was told that=\r\n while this was a &quot;good idea in principle,&quot; it\n&gt; was not practical because =\r\nHDAS is simply not set up to deal with this.\n&gt;\n&gt; The Way Forward\n&gt; My overr=\r\niding concern throughout this investigation has been to find a way\n&gt; to do =\r\ndamage control in order to protect the broader interests of dharma.\n&gt; This =\r\nrequires a pragmatic approach. Given the state of affairs, it seems\n&gt; that =\r\nthe mess cannot be created without the swami leaving the movement and\n&gt; goi=\r\nng into a strictly private life of meditation and self inquiry. I worry\n&gt; f=\r\nor the young ashramites who I feel are amazing individuals but in need of\n&gt;=\r\n proper mentoring. They have a solid commitment to the cause and their\n&gt; pe=\r\nrsonal spiritual paths, but they lack the sophistication and maturity to\n&gt; =\r\ndeal with what they face today.\n&gt;\n&gt; Swami Nithyananda should resign immedia=\r\ntely and hand over all his\n&gt; organizations to senior spiritual masters, pre=\r\nferably Shaivites practicing\n&gt; the Shiva Sutras and related traditions. He =\r\ntold me in an interview hat I\n&gt; recorded on March 9th that he was willing t=\r\no leave everything and become a\n&gt; wandering sadhu again. I wish that interv=\r\niew had been aired.\n&gt;\n&gt; The new spiritual leaders would give the ashram a n=\r\new life and chance to\n&gt; revive itself. It could either remain a place for s=\r\npiritual training or turn\n&gt; itself into a Hindu social service organization=\r\n. Either way it would be a\n&gt; better outcome than the likely alternative of =\r\nthe government stepping in to\n&gt; take over the ashram and turn it over to ad=\r\nministrators who are not\n&gt; positively disposed to Hindu spirituality =96 as=\r\n has happened in numerous\n&gt; similar cases of government takeovers of Hindu =\r\ntemples and organizations\n&gt; despite government claims of its actions being =\r\n&quot;secular&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; Besides giving up the organization, Swami Nithyananda should=\r\n return to his\n&gt; personal sadhana under the guidance of these spiritual lea=\r\nders. Let them\n&gt; evaluate him and his organization, and issue their indepen=\r\ndent report to the\n&gt; public. Swami Nithyananda should fearlessly and humbly=\r\n submit himself to\n&gt; their judgment of what happened and what the remedies =\r\nought to be.\n&gt;\n&gt; Hinduism has survived for many millennia and faced many ki=\r\nnds of crises,\n&gt; just like all the other major religions of the world. It h=\r\nas its own\n&gt; internal resources and mechanisms to deal with such situations=\r\n. These need\n&gt; to be put to use and they need to become modernized. This is=\r\n not the last\n&gt; such scandal Hindu groups are going to face in the near fut=\r\nure.\n&gt; ---\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound to persi=\r\nst so long as\n&gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna Paramahamsa\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n\n\r\n--000e0cd351943a80f704821b9e31\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\nThanks for providing this=A0article.&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;=\r\n&gt;On Thu, Mar 18, 2010 at 10:51 PM, Hemanth Srinivas &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;=\r\na href=3D&quot;mailto:hemanthks@...&quot;&gt;hemanthks@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wr=\r\note:&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;blockquote class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;margin:0 0 0 .8ex;borde=\r\nr-left:1px #ccc solid;padding-left:1ex;&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;backgr=\r\nound-color:#fff&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n  &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;div&gt;\n      \n     =\r\n \n      &lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;Namaste:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;An article about Swami Nity=\r\nananda.

I was also finalizing my new book which deals specifically with Tami=\r\nl Nadu religious politics, and in particular with the role of various nexus=\r\nes based overseas. So I decided to jump into the eye of the storm of this s=\r\ncandal in order to investigate whether similar nexuses were at work in this=\r\n case. Naturally, at one level I have seen this scandal through the framewo=\r\nrk of a civilization encounter in which Vedic culture is pitted against the=\r\n Dravidian divisiveness that is being backed by Christian evangelism. At an=\r\nother level, I found that the sensationalized media reports were too one-si=\r\nded, and none of them had a single statement to report from the swami himse=\r\nlf. Furthermore, there was chaos and mismanagement of the crisis from Swami=\r\n Nithyananda&#39;s inner circle. In hindsight, things might have turned out=\r\n differently had they managed more sensibly and faster =96 which I will ela=\r\nborate later in this article. Given this, another interest of mine has been=\r\n to extrapolate important lessons from this episode for other Hindu organiz=\r\nations, which I predict will face similar scandals as and when their weakne=\r\nsses become understood by those opposed to them. This article highlights my=\r\n findings at these multiple levels and issues.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;During this 2-week=\r\n investigative period, I have been loyal to my pledge to give Swami Nithyan=\r\nanda&#39;s organization the benefit of doubt and to report their side of th=\r\ne story. Besides wanting to balance out the one-sided media depictions, I w=\r\nanted access to the ashram&#39;s core group for my own research on the broa=\r\nder subject of civilization encounters. I respect the sensitivities of that=\r\n organization consisting of many decent and dedicated devotees who have sac=\r\nrificed a great deal and stand to lose a lot.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;But I have conclude=\r\nd that the situation is now beyond repair for Swami Nithyananda and that hi=\r\ns continued involvement can only damage the broader interests of dharma as =\r\nwell as jeopardize the ashramites. Along with two other sympathizers who ar=\r\ne not ashramites, I have personally recommended to Swami Nithyananda that t=\r\nhe best course at this stage would be for him to resign completely from his=\r\n organization. He should turn it over to a small team of senior Hindu mahat=\r\nmas, so that the assets can be used in the best interests of dharma. Furthe=\r\nr, under the guidance of these mahatmas he must live a quiet life as a sadh=\r\nu devoid of any institutional responsibilities. Because the head of any org=\r\nanization must accept responsibility that &quot;the buck stops here,&quot; =\r\nonly such a move can salvage the organization and the reputation of dharma =\r\nat large. Over several years, this resignation would hopefully reduce the m=\r\nassive pressure that has built up against him personally, and enable him to=\r\n live peacefully as a sadhu. It is up to him to accept or reject this advic=\r\ne. The basis for this conclusion becomes clearer once the reader has gone t=\r\nhrough the rest of this article. &lt;br&gt;\n\n\nI want to begin by examining some p=\r\nrinciples about the relationships between siddhis (extraordinary yogic powe=\r\nrs), morality, Tantra and sex. This will provide the framework in which to =\r\ninterpret what has happened. Then I will turn to my initial interest in pur=\r\nsuing the challenges facing Hinduism in south India from a variety of force=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Siddhis (Extraordinary Yogic Powers) and Morality&lt;br&gt;A few=\r\n days ago, I had the honor of having a two-hour private conversation with S=\r\nri Sri Ravi Shankar at his ashram in Rishikesh. I introduced myself as an i=\r\nndependent researcher who is writing a series of books on Indian civilizati=\r\non in the context of the global challenges and opportunities. One of my vol=\r\numes will be specifically on the major global gurus since the 1960s =96 inc=\r\nluding Krishnamurti, Swami Muktananda, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Pabhupada, am=\r\nong others - as well as living global gurus such as Sri Sri himself. I have=\r\n been investigating what happened to such gurus, in terms of the shifts in =\r\ntheir Western followers over time, their scandals, their Indian followers a=\r\nnd critics, and also how each guru negotiated his/her position sandwiched b=\r\netween Indian orthodoxy on one side and Western modernity on the other. The=\r\n relevance of this in the context of Swami Nithyananda will become clear ve=\r\nry soon.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;The first provocative question I asked Sri Sri concerned=\r\n the nature of yogic powers: What is the relationship between siddhis and m=\r\norality? If siddhis are a scientific phenomena dealing with powers that can=\r\n be harnessed by all humans then one must bear in mind that science deals w=\r\nith truths that are morally neutral. If Einstein was declared to have lived=\r\n an immoral life it would not invalidate his scientific theories. A person =\r\nwho designs aircrafts or any other complex technological systems may or may=\r\n not be moral in order to be effective in his technical work. In other word=\r\ns, rtam (the patterns of the cosmos), which we discover and call science, f=\r\nunctions independently of human morality. This is why a scientific principl=\r\ne can be used either morally or immorally, because it is independent of mor=\r\nality. There are moral persons who lack any siddhis or even ordinary scient=\r\nific competence. Conversely, there are great siddhas (like Ravana) who lack=\r\n morality. Sri Sri&#39;s pranayama techniques would also produce results fo=\r\nr an immoral person. &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Sri Sri seemed impressed by this question, =\r\nand agreed with my overall position on the independence between siddhis and=\r\n morality. But he pointed out that the moral dimension, while not determini=\r\nng the siddhis, was also important because it led to receiving the grace of=\r\n the divine. I agree with him. &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;So there are two separate phenome=\r\nna involved: (i) spiritual technologies that are objective and that allow a=\r\nnyone to harness spiritual energies, and (ii) morality which is important i=\r\nn itself, not for attaining siddhis, but in order to have a positive relati=\r\nonship with the divine. Either one can be developed without the other; howe=\r\nver, the dharma tradition encourages us to cultivate both. The reason that =\r\nmeditation systems prescribe things like vegetarian diet, ahimsa, etc. is b=\r\necause an inappropriate lifestyle interferes with the mental tranquility re=\r\nquired to advance. This lifestyle change can be appreciated regardless of w=\r\nhether one believes in a personal God or not. This absence of a personal Go=\r\nd is clear in Buddhist meditation. Different Hindu systems place different =\r\nlevels of emphasis upon a personal God for the yoga to function. This is wh=\r\ny many secular and scientifically minded persons are also drawn towards med=\r\nitation techniques. In other words, something cannot be a science if it dep=\r\nends upon morality, because science is objective and stands independent of =\r\nmorality.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;The relevance of this question is as follows: Many pers=\r\nons who have learned advanced meditation from Swami Nithyananda want to kno=\r\nw if any moral breaches by him would invalidate the whole Hindu claim of ac=\r\nhieving higher states of consciousness. When a far worse sex scandal agains=\r\nt the legendary Swami Muktananda emerged in the 1990s, involving charges by=\r\n a large number of his Western female disciples, the Western academy rashly=\r\n condemned not only one man&#39;s morality, but also the whole legitimacy o=\r\nf the Indian tradition itself. In that series of debates (with RISA scholar=\r\ns like Sarah Caldwell, etc.), I took the same position then as I am taking =\r\nnow: that Muktananda&#39;s capabilities in harnessing spiritual energies ar=\r\ne separate and independent from whether or not he violated any code of mora=\r\nlity. &lt;br&gt;\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;Patanjali warns against getting lured by siddhis which app=\r\near along the way when one practices advanced meditation persistently. One =\r\nis not supposed to indulge in them. This warning is found in various Hindu =\r\nsystems that deal with the body as a vehicle for spiritual evolution, becau=\r\nse these energies are very powerful and can get out of control. Another poi=\r\nnt that is worth noting is that the techniques taught by Swami Nithyananda =\r\nare not his original ones; he has made it clear repeatedly \n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
