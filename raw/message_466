I prayed to \nBabaji for that and I =\r\ngot it from Sri Sri Ravishankar.\n\nFirst came Thakur in my life thro&#39; Gospel=\r\n, then came Autobiography of \na Yogi, Babaji, SJC and Art of Living and Fin=\r\nally came my Spiritual \nGuru, Shri Narasimha.\n\nWhat i need to convey is tha=\r\nt I didn&#39;t join Ramakrishna Mission after \nThakur took my hold as Black Cob=\r\nra grasps an ignorant frog.\nBabaji didn&#39;t take me to &#39;Self Realisation Soci=\r\nety of Yoagananda for \nparting the knowledge of Kriya yoga to me instead he=\r\n made \narrangements with Sri Sri Ravishankar of Art of Living. Now this \nam=\r\nply clears that Kriya Yoga taught by Babaji and Sudarshan Kriya \nYoga by AO=\r\nL is no different though apprently taught by two different \nspiritually ori=\r\nented organisation. Thakur introduced me to SJC   \nand i met very worthy an=\r\nd very knowledgeable scholars like Shri \nSanjay Rath, Narasimha, Ramanaraya=\r\nn, Visti and so many others. but i \ncouldn&#39;t join formally the Organisation=\r\n as it seemed to me that \nJyotish shastra has done its job for me and there=\r\n was not much \nenthusiasm left for astrology (Very Surprising as i was hype=\r\nr for \nastrology for last 12 years or so). I can not fool myself and others=\r\n \nby joining and doing nothing worthwile for it. I waited & waited and \nfin=\r\nally i was fortunate enough to get My Guru in Narasimha.\n\nMy above experien=\r\nces in the last 4 years tells me some real truths.\n\n1) All the spiritual li=\r\nghts are connected to each other hence one \nmust not feel that my lineage i=\r\ns the best and criticise others.\n\n2) i Developed respect for All Saints, Sa=\r\nkshaatkaris and Mumukshus \nwhatever lineage, religion or path they come fro=\r\nm\n\n3) One will finally reach to the Guru, to whom one is destined to go \nan=\r\nd that doesn&#39;t always mean that Guru comes from a very highly \ncelebrated o=\r\nrganisation or is a ccelebrated persobnality. That also \ndoesn&#39;t mean that =\r\na very famous person revered as Guru by Millions is \na fake one. (Sri Sri R=\r\navishankar is criticised by many but i have no \ndoubt that he is a spiritua=\r\nl Giant) but one must be sincere in \nhis/her aspiration and should take the=\r\n responsibility of doing \nSadhanas.\n\n4) Blind faith is not healthy unless a=\r\nll the doubts are dispelled and \nconcrete revelation is experienced.\n\n5) In=\r\nfluence of Thakur expanded my horizon of Tolerance. from the \nchildhood i b=\r\nelieved that all the different religion are true. i was \nnever a fanatic an=\r\nd Thakur Reassured it. I can go to church, Mosque \nor any other religious T=\r\nemple of different faith and always be a \nHindu by heart. I can pray to All=\r\nah, Jesus. but if somebody points a \nAK47 at me and asks me to convert, i&#39;l=\r\nl die but never change. this is \nhow i feel. i believe. NOW THE TIME has co=\r\nme for everybody and i \nstress EVERYBODY that we must NOT ONLY RESPECT but =\r\ntruly belive that \nall the different paths and ideology are true as long as=\r\n Spiritual \ndestination is the prime mover thought behind them. A truly spi=\r\nritual \nperson will ask a Muslim to offer Namaz, remebmer Allah and lead a =\r\n\npious life but will NOT influence him to become Hindu and forget \nIslaam. =\r\nSame way for Christens, Buddhist and vice versa.\n \nForgive me for writing l=\r\not of personal incidents and also going off \nthe track but i don&#39;t know how=\r\n to convey this without mentioning own \nlife events.\n\nthanks for baring me.=\r\n\n\nBest Regards,\n\nspiritually yours,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Makes yo=\r\nu wonder about the Divine connection between all these\n&gt; &gt; supremely elevat=\r\ned souls!\n&gt; \n&gt; Earlier, I was exerting discretion in sharing personal accou=\r\nnts, \nbut She has\n&gt; been making me drop guard of late, for whatever reason.=\r\n I will \ncontinue in\n&gt; the same vein for a little more time.\n&gt; \n&gt; I had a d=\r\nream a couple of years ago early in the morning. In the \ndream,\n&gt; there was=\r\n a big ritual fire. My guru Manish Pandit and I were \nsitting in\n&gt; front of=\r\n the fire. He was teaching me some pranayama techniques in \nthe\n&gt; dream. Su=\r\nddenly, he changed into somebody else that I could not \nrecognize.\n&gt; It was=\r\n not anybody I had seen before.\n&gt; \n&gt; I mentioned this dream to my guru afte=\r\nr a couple of weeks. First he \nsaid he\n&gt; did not know who the other person =\r\nwas and said he would&#39;ve probably \nknown if\n&gt; I had mentioned the dream soo=\r\nn after it had happened. I left it \nthere.\n&gt; However, when we talked in the=\r\n next weekend, he referred to my \ndream and\n&gt; said he had an idea who it wa=\r\ns. He gave me a name and asked me to \nsearch on\n&gt; the internet for his phot=\r\no and see if he was the person I saw in my \ndream.\n&gt; It was a guru from the=\r\n lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda (before \nhim). Though\n&gt; he is apparently =\r\nwell-known, I was not knowledegable about this \nlineage and\n&gt; did not see h=\r\nis picture before. I searched on the internet and \nfound a\n&gt; photo. Interes=\r\ntingly, the photo was very close to the person I saw \nin my\n&gt; dream. The pe=\r\nrson that Manish transformed into in my dream looked \nlike a\n&gt; slightly you=\r\nnger version of that photo.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I confirmed this to Manish, he only s=\r\nmiled and \nsaid, &quot;Narasimha, there\n&gt; are so many links between various line=\r\nages. Leave it for now.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, I do not know much about kriya yog=\r\na or about the lineage \nof\n&gt; Paramahamsa Yogananda. Our lineage of this lif=\r\ne starts from \nDattatreya. We\n&gt; have a special attachment to Ramakrishna Pa=\r\nramahamsa and his \nlineage and got\n&gt; a lot of our knowledge, inspiration an=\r\nd perhaps experience from \nthem. We do\n&gt; not have any direct link to the li=\r\nneage of Paramahamsa Yogananda. \nBut,\n&gt; Manish thought there were some othe=\r\nr indirect links. Moreover, he \nguessed\n&gt; who I saw, even though I myself h=\r\nad no idea who I saw, and he \nguessed\n&gt; correctly. That should count for so=\r\nmething!\n&gt; \n&gt; I will not be surprised if there are indeed subtle connection=\r\ns \nbetween\n&gt; several lineages that seem disjoint today.\n&gt; \n&gt; By the way, Sw=\r\nami Vivekananda also appeared in the prison cell of \nSri\n&gt; Aurobindo (who w=\r\nrote brilliant commentaries on Veda and Upanishad) \nand\n&gt; imparted him some=\r\n Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; An inter=\r\nesting coincidence is that a swamiji from Puri contacted me \nwithin a\n&gt; few=\r\n days after I saw that photo. His guru and Paramahamsa Yogananda \nwere\n&gt; co=\r\n-disciples of the same guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). He is the \nkeeper of\n&gt; so=\r\nme astrological knowledge that his guru received from Yukteshwar \nMaharaj.\n=\r\n&gt; He visited me after a month, discussed that knowledge and spent a \nday at=\r\n my\n&gt; house. Thus, some small connection was made with a representative \nof=\r\n that\n&gt; lineage soon after the dream. After all, some karmik debts may have=\r\n \nbeen\n&gt; there...\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; I want to make one thing cl=\r\near.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some things I mention like this may give the impression that my \n=\r\nguru has\n&gt; some psychic abilities or siddhis. That may indeed be true. But =\r\nhe \nalways\n&gt; downplays those things and attaches no importance whatsoever. =\r\nHe \nsays,\n&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I am a useless person and lower than dirt and capab=\r\nle of\n&gt; nothing. It is all Her power. She is the connection between every \n=\r\nentity in\n&gt; this universe. She may choose an idiot like me as an instrument=\r\n \nsometimes\n&gt; and do something using me. I have no special abilities of any=\r\n kind. \nAny\n&gt; coincidences you find are just Her grace and not due to me.&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I realized in time that this simplicity, humility and lack of ego \nis =\r\nnot\n&gt; fake. I also realized that this lack of ego is what enabled him to \nd=\r\no things\n&gt; that sound impossible or difficult. In fact, I realized that man=\r\ny \ngreat\n&gt; saints in the past were like this. Several magical things happen=\r\ned \nthrough\n&gt; them, but they did not find any pride in them and retained th=\r\neir \nhumility\n&gt; and sense of surrender to their chosen form of god and beli=\r\neved \nthat god\n&gt; was the doer of all things and they were mere instruments.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; The day you also start believing that, not for the sake of \nlecturing=\r\n or\n&gt; posturing, but from the deep cores of your heart, your sadhana will \n=\r\nbear\n&gt; fruit.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; =\r\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagan=\r\nnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Messa=\r\nge ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Monday, September 29, 2008 5:54 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] Yogananda (Re: Dharma)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;N=\r\narasimha P.V.R.
