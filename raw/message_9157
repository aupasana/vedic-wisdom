What is our destiny?&quot;........\n\n.............=\r\n...&quot;There is a great cycle. In this cosmic existence there is a great cycle=\r\n. The sun shines upon the oceans, upon the seas, upon huge lakes, upon all =\r\ncollections of water. And when the heat of the sun intensifies, the water b=\r\negins to evaporate, it gives up its substance, its thickness and rises up a=\r\ns vapour and ascends into the skies, and upward winds help its ascent......=\r\n...Ponder this cycle!&quot;\n\n&quot;You are now in one half of the circle. You have be=\r\nen born into this state of identification with the gross physical body whic=\r\nh is perishable, which is subject to so many imperfections, change, disease=\r\n, old age, infirmities and one day it has to pass. Now you are involved wit=\r\nh that which is not your real identity, your real Self=97it is non-self....=\r\n..\n\n.......whereas you are an uncreated principle, eternal, beginningless, =\r\ntimeless, for you are one with the cosmic principle. Temporarily you have f=\r\norgotten your eternal oneness with that. It is a state where you have wande=\r\nred away and have become alienated from your source and origin, and that ha=\r\ns started all your problems.&quot;\n\n.... &quot;All your weeping and wailing, all your=\r\n present human pains and sorrows and sufferings are to be directly attribut=\r\ned to your having separated yourself in consciousness from that great reali=\r\nty which is the very quintessence of peace and joy.&quot;\n\n&quot;So from this state w=\r\nhere only half the cycle has taken place you have to start the journey back=\r\n home and complete the cycle and rest once again in that pristine state of =\r\ndivine perfection and freedom.&quot;\n\n&quot;This is the destiny of man as cognised by=\r\n seers of transcendental divine insight.&quot;\n\nThe full article which is well w=\r\north a read is available here\n\nhttp://www.chidananda.org/article-details.ph=\r\np?rID=3D17\n\n\n\n"}}
