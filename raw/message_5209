I will reply to the=\r\nm together.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; * * *\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Regarding mail 1 below on priests:\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; D=\r\noing rituals for one&#39;s own upliftment is one thing and doing it for others =\r\nis another. In the former, one is cleaning up a dirty place that one is for=\r\nced to live in. In the latter, one is going to someone else&#39;s dirty place a=\r\nnd cleaning it up. If there is some radioactive waste there and one is not =\r\nprotected, one may be affected.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; As I keep saying, results of one&#39;s p=\r\nrevious karmas are like fruits lying in a basket. One takes out one fruit a=\r\nfter another and eats them. Some may be tasty and some may be bitter or rot=\r\nten. When one does rituals and other spiritual sadhana, the deities throw a=\r\nway some bad fruits into a trash can and make one eat good fruits earlier t=\r\nhan otherwise. But there may be some spillage as dirty fruits are thrown aw=\r\nay. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be affected by the spillag=\r\ne.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and generated enough=\r\n purity to handle such things. Many priests of today do not do enough penan=\r\nce. They are quite vulnerable as they start messing with other people&#39;s kar=\r\nmas.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Secondly, many priests of today who conduct poojas are not real=\r\nly brahmanas. Being born to a brahmana father is neither necessary nor suff=\r\nicient for one to become a brahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and a=\r\nctions have to be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today think of power and in=\r\nfluence over others or of money or of comforts. They are not thinking just =\r\nof knowledge and liberation. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there =\r\nare very very few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rit=\r\nuals can be performed for others only by brahmanas. What it means is that o=\r\nne desirous of power, influence, money and comforts is unfit to perform rit=\r\nuals for others.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Well, stop d=\r\noing rituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance when you are not =\r\ndoing rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle desc=\r\nribed in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahm=\r\nana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vais=\r\nyas.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; * * *\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Regarding mail 2 below on astrologers:\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; This=\r\n is not an immature comment and there is an element of truth in it. A lot o=\r\nf what I said above applies here too.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Every action performed with eg=\r\no (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an astrolog=\r\ner&#39;s action of giving advice to someone resulted in that person doing X ins=\r\ntead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in coming y=\r\nears, there is clearly an action here. If the astrologer has some sense of =\r\n&quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to experience the fruits of it. Some b=\r\nlessings can come and some sufferings can come too.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Messing with som=\r\neone else&#39;s karmas is always a risky business.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; What is the solution?=\r\n Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle de=\r\nscribed in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a bra=\r\nhmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisya=\r\ns. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a bra=\r\nhmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the ka=\r\nrmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Aga=\r\nin, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahm=\r\nanas by conduct.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; The above will become clear, if you look at the cri=\r\nteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught Jyotish=\r\n!\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Best regards,\n\n&gt; Narasimha\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, =\r\nFree Jyotish textbook,\n\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Ho=\r\nmam and Pitri Tarpana:\n\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n\n&gt; Films that make=\r\n a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/JyotishWritings\n\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Mail 1:\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote=\r\n: \n\n&gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any curse(Shapam)?\n\n&gt; &gt; This I=\r\n am asking after seeing the overall and general condition of Brahmanas spec=\r\nially those who do pujas for Yajmanas and involved in Karmakanda.\n\n&gt; &gt; And =\r\nif this is true is there any remedy for this?\n\n&gt; &gt; I think this is the only=\r\n place where we can discuss this subject hence I am posting this query here=\r\n.Thanks a lot in advance.\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; Mail 2:\n\n&gt; \n\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other=\r\n educated Scholars,\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (Naras=\r\nimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training sessions and am very eager to review my own chart. \n=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n\n&gt; &gt; However in numerous instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through fr=\r\niends and close uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse impact on y=\r\nourself (astrologer) and yrou family.

If there is some radioactive waste there and o=\r\nne is not protected, one may be affected.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; As I keep sayi=\r\nng, results of one&#39;s previous karmas are like fruits lying in a basket. One=\r\n takes out one fruit after another and eats them. Some may be tasty and som=\r\ne may be bitter or rotten. When one does rituals and other spiritual sadhan=\r\na, the deities throw away some bad fruits into a trash can and make one eat=\r\n good fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be some spillage as dirt=\r\ny fruits are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be a=\r\nffected by the spillage.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; In the old days, priests did in=\r\ntense sadhana and generated enough purity to handle such things. Many pries=\r\nts of today do not do enough penance. They are quite vulnerable as they sta=\r\nrt messing with other people&#39;s karmas.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Secondly, many pr=\r\niests of today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to a=\r\n brahmana father is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become a br=\r\nahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-li=\r\nke. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of mon=\r\ney or of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. =\r\nThey are not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas o=\r\nn earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for oth=\r\ners only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influen=\r\nce, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Well, stop doi=\r\nng rituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance when you are not do=\r\ning rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle descri=\r\nbed in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahman=\r\na by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisya=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; * * *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Regarding mail 2 below on as=\r\ntrologers:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; This is not an immature comment and there is =\r\nan element of truth in it. A lot of what I said above applies here too.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Every action performed with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing thi=\r\ns&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action of giving advice =\r\nto someone resulted in that person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroa=\r\nds and experiencing Z instead of W in coming years, there is clearly an act=\r\nion here. If the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one i=\r\ns bound to experience the fruits of it. Some blessings can come and some su=\r\nfferings can come too.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s karma=\r\ns is always a risky business.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; What is the solution? Well=\r\n, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle describ=\r\ned in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana=\r\n by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas. Ir=\r\nrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahmana=\r\n if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karmas =\r\nof others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again, t=\r\no be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmanas =\r\nby conduct.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; The above will become clear, if you look at =\r\nthe criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught =\r\nJyotish!&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -----=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Free Jyotish=\r\n Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Free &quot;=\r\nDo It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Films that make a difference=\r\n: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;=\r\nhttp://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ta=\r\nrget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jyoti=\r\nshWritings&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ----=\r\n------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; M=\r\nail 1:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailt=\r\no=3D&quot;mailto:aksha.rudra%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?=\r\nto=3Daksha.rudra%40yahoo.com&quot;&gt;aksha.rudra@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any curse(Shapam)?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; This I am asking after seeing the overall and general condition of Brahma=\r\nnas specially those who do pujas for Yajmanas and involved in Karmakanda.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; And if this is true is there any remedy for this?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt=\r\n; I think this is the only place where we can discuss this subject hence I =\r\nam posting this query here.Thanks a lot in advance.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Mail=\r\n 2:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; --- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-w=\r\nisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-w=\r\nisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl=\r\n_yhoo@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other educated S=\r\ncholars,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your=\r\n (Narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training sessions and am very eager to review my own c=\r\nhart. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; However in numerous instances in the pa=\r\nst, I&#39;ve heard through friends and close uncles that astrology can have a s=\r\nevere adverse impact on yourself (astrologer) and yrou family.
