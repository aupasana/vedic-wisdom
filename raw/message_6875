Possibly the only \n&gt; person I have met in Twitter who has well understood Dharm. Glad we \n&gt; met.\n&gt; @homam108 I am also happy that your focus is on pariyatti and \n&gt; patipatti. Both theory and practice. Experience is the only vehicle of \n&gt; wisdom.\n&gt; Must Follow @homam108. He can discuss Dharm with clarity. Above all, \n&gt; he knows the importance of experience over reading.\n&gt; @homam108 What kind of experience is important?\n&gt; @homam108 How important are questions on existence of Atman or absence \n&gt; of it, when they are still seekers?\n&gt; @homam108 Do Ved focus on existence of Atman more than its focus on \n&gt; Samyak Karma and attaining wisdom through experience?\n\nThough ocean is one, the ripples on the surface are many. At different \ndepths/loocations, ocean has different qualities. Similarly, though \nAatman (ocean) is one, the manifestations (ripples) in the material \nrealm (surface) are many. At different realms of awareness \n(depths/locations), Aatman manifests differently in the field of \nduality.\n\nOne can have an infinite variety of experiences within the field of \nduality. One can &quot;see&quot; deities with various forms internally; one can \n&quot;see&quot; various kinds of light, one can &quot;hear&quot; various kinds of sounds, \netc. One can lose awareness of the body completely, perceive the entire \ncosmos within the body and identify with some object within the cosmos \nand experience things from that perspective.\n\nBut, the bottomline is that all experiences within the field of duality \nare impermanent. The only &quot;experience&quot; that is really worthwhile is that \nof Self, where there are no boundaries within consciousness between the \nexperiencer, the object of experience and the action of experiencing.\n\nHowever, some people DO experience various things on the way, just as \none driving to the mountain top may see beautiful sceneries on the ghat \nroad (curvy mountain road). Just as one does not reach the mountain top \nif one likes some scenery so much that one stays there, similarly one \ndeveloping an attachment to an experience will get stuck there and does \nnot go on to experience Self. The peace and bliss one derives from any \nof these dualistic experiences is nice, but impermanent. The only source \nof everlasting and limitless peace and bliss is constant and equanimous \nawareness of Self, i.e. viewing everything as Self and not getting \nattracted to or being averse to anything.\n\nThe highest experience is that of a state where nothing disturbs the \nequanimity, where all beings and objects are seen by mind as Self though \nsenses perceive them differently, where one&#39;s heart feels no attraction \nand aversion to anybody or anything, no like or dislike, no pleasure or \npain in awareness of any dual reality, where one is able to engage in \nany action determined as necessary by one&#39;s intelligence, based on the \ndesires that spontaneously arise in heart, where one is not affected \npositively and negatively by the results of any actions, just notices \nthe result and moves on to the next action, where one is able to engage \nin powerful actions as though one is deeply desirous of a specific \nresult, and yet is equally prepared for any result in the end, where \none&#39;s heart is not touched by six internal enemies such as lust, anger, \njealosy etc and the eight bondages such as fear, shame etc.\n\nOn the way to experiencing this state, one may experience many things \nand experience different levels of peace, calmness and happiness. But, \none should not stop until one reaches this state. The only measure of \nhow much progress one made is how equanimous one&#39;s mind is. Others may \nor may not be able to see it, but one knows for oneself how equanimous \none&#39;s mind is.\n\nIn the beginning, having a simple belief system and following some \nprocedures with discipline is helpful. Compared to the one who keeps \nchanting, &quot;it does not matter from where you climb the mountain, but the \nkey is reach the mountain top&quot; and remains at the base of the mountain \nforever, one who keeps arguing &quot;your way does not reach the top. It \nstops in the middle. Come and climb in my path. This is the only path \nthat reaches the top&quot; and keeps walking on a path, is better! The first \none knows truth, but is not acting on it. The second one has \nmisconceptions, but he is atleast climbing the mountain. As he reaches \nthe top, he will actually see that all paths from all sides of the \nmountain are indeed reaching the top and his misconceptions will be \ndestroyed automatically!\n\nOne who is still doing sadhana and hasn&#39;t experienced Self can make \nwrong, biased, narrow-minded and zingoistic statements. But, it&#39;s ok, as \nlong as one is not killing people or causing terrible confusion in \nmasses. One is atleast making progress and eventually one will \nunderstand the meaning of RigVedic saying &quot;ekam sat, vipraa bahudhaa \nvadanti&quot; (Truth is one, but expressed variously by the learned).\n\nThat way, compared to a theoretician discussing Vedanta and high \nphilosophy, one doing a ritual everyday without fail is better off. Of \ncourse, if one has an understanding of theoretical philosophy, engages \nin some sadhana with discipline, and keeps absorbing the philosophy into \none&#39;s thinking, so that it will oneday guide all of one&#39;s actions, \nwords, thoughts and impulses, one will progress faster.\n\nWhen watching a movie, one can exclaim &quot;this is just a movie and not \nreal. There is no need to take it seriously&quot;. Yet, when a truly scary \nscene comes, one may be startled! One watching the movie again and again \nwhile contemplating the above theoretical knowledge will eventually \nreprogram one&#39;s instincts and scary scenes will no longer startle one, \nsad scenes will no longer make one cry, or happy scenes will no longer \nmake one jump up in joy. Understtanding (gyaan) and practice (karma) are \nboth required to permanently ingrain correct understanding on one&#39;s \nconsciousness and make one stop reacting in a deluded manner to the \nfield of duality.\n\nOn various paths (such as Vedic vs Tantrik), a nice analogy was given on \npages 130-131 of the free PDF eBook at:\n\nhttp://tinyurl.com/vedicwisdom\n\nIn the same eBook, page 104 contains a nice analogy that explains \nadwaita, visishta adwaita and dwaita.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
