I did use one that was gifted by the same priest who gifted me so many \nother religious articles. However, in my judgment, I had more fruitful \nsessions of Mahalakshmi meditation with Rudraksha mala than with it. \nRudraksha and Tulasi are very special compared to all other malas.\n\nInstead of using a different mala for each deity, it is a good idea to use a \nsingle mala for all meditation and let it be a repository of all the \ngenerated energy.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThis reminds me of an unrelated incident. When Shata Chandi homam conducted \nin Chennai in March 2006 was finished, priests bathed the idols in the \ngarbhaalaya with the water from the kalashas (pots) used in the homas and \nbrought malas from the idol and gave them to us. The priest put a Rudraksha \nmala from the Mother around my neck. A passing thought came to me and got \nstuck in my mind for a couple of seconds, &quot;I already have so many rudraksha \nmalas, but I have no sphatika mala, which is considered ideal for the \nMother. I just took a vow of doing Chandipath for 108 days. I wish he had \ngiven me a sphatika mala instead of this rudraksha mala.&quot; Then I forgot \nabout that stupid thought.\n\nThis was in the afternoon. Next morning, we were in a flight from Chennai to \nHyderabad. In another day, I was to leave for Boston. In the flight to\nHyderabad, my son was kicking the seat in front of him and the gentleman \nturned back to complain. I apologized and told my son to behave. The \ngentleman turned forward and again turned back in a few seconds and asked \n&quot;you are PVR Narasimha Rao, right?&quot; I said yes. He apparently uses my free \nJyotish software and likes me. Though I had offered all my hair to Balaji at \nThirumala a few days back and was without any hair, he still identified me \nbased on a photo published 6 years back in an interview in a Jyotish \nmagazine! He talked to me for a while.\n\nWhen we reached Hyderabad, he ran to the baggage claim, collected his \nsuitcase, took out a sphatika mala from it and gifted it to me. He said he \nmet a saint on the previous afternoon at Chennai and the saint gave him \nthree sphatika malas - one for him, one for a family member and the third \none meant for someone else. The saint told him that he would meet somebody \nhe respected on the next day and he was supposed to hand over the mala to \nthat person. When he saw me, he decided that the mala was meant for me. \nInterestingly, his meeting with the saint happened around the same time I \nhad that stupid thought about sphatika mala in the garbhalaya of the temple.\n\nDuring shata Chandi homam, I took a vow to read Chandipath for 108 \nconsecutive days. I did it and used that mala to count the moola mantra. At \nthe end, that priest came to Boston and conducted 10 Chandi homas at our \nhouse to complete the sadhana. During the last homam, a strong thought came \nto my mind, &quot;the purpose for which that sphatika mala was sent is over. Now \noffer it back to the Mother in fire.&quot; I suppressed my instincts and did not \ndo it. I wanted to hang on to it. See, I formed an attachment with it! \nInterestingly, that mala broke on the same evening, a little after that \nhomam was finished! Of course, I made a mala again with the sphatikas and \nkept it for offering it in fire next time. Now I realized that my attachment \nwas foolish.\n\nOf course, I did Chandipath and Chandi homam many more times after that, but \nthat was the first 108 and I was destined to use the mala given by that \nsaint for that round. Now, of course, I use the same rudraksha mala for \neverything and did not look for another sphatika mala.\n\n*        *        *\n\nIt is the nature of mind to see variety. There are different types of malas \nand different kinds of rituals and mind is fascinated by the variety. At the \nend, mind needs to be trained to see the same in the variety. But, in the \nbeginning, mind does see variety and it needs to wade through variety...\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;sbm_sharma&quot; &lt;sbm_sharma@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, February 06, 2009 3:27 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Mala For Ganesha\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste. I would like to ask you yet another\n&gt; question.\n&gt;\n&gt; Which mala is best for Ganesha Japa? I know you\n&gt; say to stick with one mala for all Japa however my\n&gt; mind cannot fully accept this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Which mala is best for Ganesha? Sandalwood,\n&gt; Turmeric or Sphatik? Or something\n&gt; else entirely? Thank you.\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards\n\n\n"}}
