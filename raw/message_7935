However, as they have a huge \nrepertoire of things they ca=\r\nn give and a nice judgment on what is good \nfor you, they may or may not gi=\r\nve you what you asked for right away. \nThey may give you something else tha=\r\nt is better for you (from the \nperspective of that deity - this can change =\r\nfrom one deity to another, \nbut all deities have much better judgment than =\r\nyou!). Or, they may first \ngive you some responsibilities that prepare you =\r\nfor using what you asked \nfor well, and give you what you asked for later.\n=\r\n\nIn comparison, lower beings such as Yakshas and Yakshinis have dominion \no=\r\nver specific things and they give them to you if they are pleased. When \nyo=\r\nu approach them, you are taking extra responsibility for what you are \naski=\r\nng for and the consequences of getting it. It may work faster, but \ncomes w=\r\nith a risk. It may even compromise your spiritual progress. Most \nof these =\r\nsadhanas will be hidden or corrupted as Kali yuga progresses. \nWith sadhana=\r\n of higher deities, things may not work too fast or be too \nstraight-forwar=\r\nd, but there is less risk.\n\nThanks,\nNarasimha\n\n\n\n\n\nOn Sat, Feb 25, 2012 at =\r\n5:46 PM, Bhupendra Jamnadas wrote:\n\n\nNamaste Narasimha Ji,\n\n\n\nWhat is the p=\r\nurpose of Kubera homa?
