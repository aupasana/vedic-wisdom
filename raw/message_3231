Howev=\r\ner , I&#39;ll honestly say that i have no answers for &#39;life in a Plant&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\nhen I used to eat non-vegetarian food many of my friends who were=C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0vegetarian people would give me a similar logic, as you mentioned in you=\r\nr first writing. My point is, as a non-vegetarian I am not claiming that I =\r\nhave any special sensitivity to plants, over animals. No. All I am saying i=\r\ns that,=C3=82=C2=A0 this logic that many vegetarian people provide to convi=\r\nnce average non-veg people to quit eating non-veg, does not hold good.\n&gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I personally can not look at butchery shops where one finds =\r\nhanging goats. its pathetic site. People in their excitements stand in queu=\r\ne to see the cutting of throat of a chicken and then take away that as parc=\r\nel. The flash of so cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is=\r\n so tasty for the humans that they just overlook the voice of their inner s=\r\nelf. a fish which comes out of water is such a disturbing site. Panting for=\r\n water (i don&#39;t have proper English word to describe the condition of a fis=\r\nh out of water). and then the dead fish thus is so tasty.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I understand and appreciate you feelings, but I personally d=\r\no not share them. Call me cruel hearted. \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; When the questio=\r\nn of sensitivity comes in, there is no universal standard for such. It is m=\r\noslty a case of conditioning. What one feels disgusted or pained about may =\r\nnot affect another. Same rule cannot be used to judge everyone.=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n \n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; Some of my non-vegetarian friends were watching discover=\r\ny channel where they showed that people in some parts of the world eat inse=\r\ncts. My friends seemed disgusted. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you can eat a ch=\r\nicken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=82=C2=A0if someone eats an insect. Just b=\r\necause one is born in a certain area in a certain culture in a certain set =\r\nof value, one gets the believe that what one is not accustomed to must be i=\r\nncorrect. I told them if in a future life time they were to be born in that=\r\n place, they would gladly keep eating insects without the slightest doubt i=\r\nn their mind. We humans are incorrigible product of our own conditions whic=\r\nh in my opinion is all right. BUT the problem happens when we think our con=\r\nditions are the only possible conditioning in the world, and therefore we w=\r\nonder why don&#39;t others share similar ideas. That is incorrect. Nature has c=\r\nreated the world diverse, and so it is. Everything is desh-kaal-patra. A pe=\r\nrson who is a\n&gt; vegetarian in this life, if he gets born in a place/culture=\r\n/ family in a later lifetime which=C3=82=C2=A0eats non-vegetarian food, he =\r\nwould not even bat an eye lid while eating the same. I know=C3=82=C2=A0peop=\r\nle who faint at the sight of blood, but there are doctors who do multiple o=\r\nperations daily. So my point is, personal sensitivity can be a very good re=\r\nason for an individual, but it=C3=82=C2=A0cannot be=C3=82=C2=A0a universal =\r\nlogic applicable to all.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; A far better angle of tackling th=\r\nis is the idea of karma. Even then, if someone can make sure he is not dire=\r\nctly killing an animal, not selecting a live animal to be killed, but rathe=\r\nr buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily. Furth=\r\ner, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=82=C2=A0does not want to deal in the r=\r\naw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of karma t=\r\nhat you would get for it is quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily handled.=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0It is similar to the one you would get for buying some simple d=\r\naal which has come to the market through the hands of a middle man who has =\r\ncheated the farmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcussions i=\r\nn all food we eat in this age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs - bro=\r\niler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be eaten beca=\r\nuse they never grow into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What karma=\r\n does one get for consuming that? God knows.\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; An average no=\r\nn-vegetarian, at least in India, to be precise is actually an omnivorous. H=\r\nis staple diet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent =\r\nnon-veg. From a scientific point of view, this is a good combination. Peopl=\r\ne who feed on more than 60 percent non-veg food in their staple diet, are p=\r\nrone to serious heath issues at a younger age.

No. All I am saying is that,=C3=82&nbsp; this logic that many ve=\r\ngetarian people provide to convince average non-veg people to quit eating n=\r\non-veg, does not hold good.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I personally can =\r\nnot look at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its pathetic site=\r\n. People in their excitements stand in queue to see the cutting of throat o=\r\nf a chicken and then take away that as parcel. The flash of so cruelly butc=\r\nhered Chicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that th=\r\ney just overlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which comes out of w=\r\nater is such a disturbing site. Panting for water (i don&#39;t have proper Engl=\r\nish word to describe the condition of a fish out of water). and then the de=\r\nad fish thus is so tasty.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n I understand and appreciate you feelings, but I personally do not share th=\r\nem. Call me cruel hearted. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; When the question =\r\nof sensitivity comes in, there is no universal standard for such. It is mos=\r\nlty a case of conditioning. What one feels disgusted or pained about may no=\r\nt affect another. Same rule cannot be used to\n judge everyone.=C3=82&nbsp; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some of my non-vegetarian friends were watchi=\r\nng discovery channel where they showed that people in some parts of the wor=\r\nld eat insects. My friends seemed disgusted. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you c=\r\nan eat a chicken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=82&nbsp;if someone eats an ins=\r\nect. Just because one is born in a certain area in a certain culture in a c=\r\nertain set of value, one gets the believe that what one is not accustomed t=\r\no must be incorrect. I told them if in a future life time they were to be b=\r\norn in that place, they would gladly keep eating insects without the slight=\r\nest doubt in their mind. We humans are incorrigible product of our own cond=\r\nitions which in my opinion is all right. BUT the problem happens when we th=\r\nink our conditions are the only possible conditioning in the world, and the=\r\nrefore we wonder why don&#39;t others share similar ideas. That is incorrect. N=\r\nature has created the world diverse, and so it is.\n Everything is desh-kaal=\r\n-patra. A person who is a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; vegetarian in this life, if he gets born =\r\nin a place/culture/ family in a later lifetime which=C3=82&nbsp;eats non-ve=\r\ngetarian food, he would not even bat an eye lid while eating the same. I kn=\r\now=C3=82&nbsp;people who faint at the sight of blood, but there are doctors=\r\n who do multiple operations daily. So my point is, personal sensitivity can=\r\n be a very good reason for an individual, but it=C3=82&nbsp;cannot be=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp;a universal logic applicable to all.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A f=\r\nar better angle of tackling this is the idea of karma. Even then, if someon=\r\ne can make sure he is not directly killing an animal, not selecting a live =\r\nanimal to be killed, but rather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma generate=\r\nd can be handled easily. Further, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=82&nbsp;=\r\ndoes not want to deal in the raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetari=\r\nan food. The amount of karma that you would get for it is quite\n acceptble =\r\nIMO. It can be easily handled.=C3=82&nbsp;It is similar to the one you woul=\r\nd get for buying some simple daal which has come to the market through the =\r\nhands of a middle man who has cheated the farmer, or God knows what else.

The flash of so cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goa=\r\nt or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that they just overlook the v=\r\noice of their inner self. a fish which comes out of water is such a disturb=\r\ning site. Panting for water (i don&#39;t have proper English word to describe t=\r\nhe condition of a fish out of water). and then the dead fish thus is so tas=\r\nty.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The bottom line is that &quot;They cannot overcome&quot; the cra=\r\nvings for the meat, fish and eggs. This is a naked reality.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; Dear Rajarshi, However i try, i am not convinced with arguments in favour=\r\n of Nonveg food. Only at the cold places and deserts where survival was the=\r\n main consideration, i can slightly agree but that too during ancient days.=\r\n not now...Now everywhere Veg food is easily available.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; **=\r\n*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Few months back, a young girl from Germany came to work in my off=\r\nice for 6 months. once i\n casually asked her as to what she eats during lun=\r\nch. what she said was not at all expected. she said that she is pure vegeta=\r\nrian and eats only Veg food since 3 years now and wants to continue that wa=\r\ny whole life. As expected, i was very happy and i further asked the reason.=\r\n The answer she gave so much happiness. She said that She does not want to =\r\nkill to eat. Vow! I salute her from my heart.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best Regards=\r\n,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups.=\r\n com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; Dear Utpal,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83=E2=80=9A=C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I slig=\r\nhtly disagree with your below mail.
