God makes each person experience good and\n&gt; bad things, *in=\r\n accordance with* what good and bad things he had earlier\n&gt; got done throug=\r\nh that person. Our conditioning influences what we do and\n&gt; what we do infl=\r\nuence what results we experience. As long as we take\n&gt; different experience=\r\ns differently and prefer some experiences to some\n&gt; others (despite pretend=\r\ning outwardly that we do not care), we do have\n&gt; some rawness (conditioning=\r\n) left and need to use free will to overcome\n&gt; it.\n\nI am still trying to wr=\r\nap my mind around this, can you give an analogy.\n\nregards\npriyank\n\n\n\n--- In=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;priyank_priyank&quot; &lt;aks_day@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; N=\r\namaste Narasimha, \n&gt; \n&gt; Notes to myself for generating devotion\n&gt; (correct =\r\nme if I am wrong)\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Bring god, Reverence, devotion in every aspect of=\r\n daily life. \n&gt; 2. Treat and see everything as god and actively develop the=\r\n devotion for God, in form of that moment/thing/object/people. \n&gt; \n&gt; 3. May=\r\nbe add a short mantra &quot;narayan-narayan&quot; here and there in whole day when yo=\r\nu come across that devotional moment. This mantra will help tie the whole p=\r\nerspective to the mantra itself. (Correct me if I am wrong)\n&gt; 4. Develop pe=\r\nrception, awareness =96 devotion, surrender will automatically come.\n&gt; \n&gt; O=\r\nne more aspect that you mentioned before in other post, also mentioned in g=\r\nospel of ramakrishan. \n&gt; 5. Ultimately one has to merge his sense of &quot;i-nes=\r\ns&quot; with god, but you do need to keep your &quot;I-ness&quot; to function in this worl=\r\nd. The best way to do that is to see yourself as loving caretaker/servant o=\r\nf your lord. This way this &quot;I-ness&quot; looses the ego and brings in devotion.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Yesterday I did read that proper method is to read NH=\r\n-LH-NH, and I wasted good 3-4 hrs yest deciding what should I do, I couldn&#39;=\r\nt decide, got frustrated and I left it there. \n&gt; ((2 things did flash in my=\r\n mind which I recall now \n&gt; 1. If you want to read daily add the beej mantr=\r\na (mukha, pada, etc) of LH at the end.  \n&gt; 2. Read LH in English, understan=\r\nding the meaning on Friday night, \n&gt; I thought what a silly thought to read=\r\n NH in Sanskrit daily and LH in English on Friday night))\n&gt; \n&gt; Today When I=\r\n finished simple narayan homam with 108 &quot;on namo narayanye&quot; there was a str=\r\nong urge to pick and simply read it form NH viniyog (not the LNH viniyog at=\r\n starting) till shloka 27. After \n&gt; This reading in homam it somehow didn&#39;t=\r\n even cross my mind till I saw your note that LH is supposed to follow.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Now that you brought it up, I felt like checking the viniyog part of each=\r\n. I am surprised to see the difference in the name of sages and devata\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n 1.

Let me know if you feel I should not read it separately.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; * *=\r\n * \n&gt; \n&gt; I am kind of surprised and inspired that you did sadhana with LNH =\r\nand got such intense results. I have read all of your posts for last 3yrs i=\r\nn this group and I dont think you ever mentioned LNH or this result. \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nIts inspiring and humbling to see the sadhana, attitude and results. My reg=\r\nards to the devi within you.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now that I have switched to simpler 108 &quot;=\r\non namo narayanaye&quot; homam, I am able to connect to fire in a much bigger wa=\r\ny. I can vouch for what you wrote \n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;When one does homam with a prayer =\r\none has a deep connection to, when one is able to identify with (or relate =\r\nto) the prayer, when one brings feeling to one&#39;s prayer, and when one is fo=\r\ncused very well and has a good level of devotion, anything is possible with=\r\n fire!&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; priyank\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Priyank ji,\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; How does one directly generate immense love/devotion/surrender? it =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; nice if you can share your learning on this.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nIf you love yourself, your body, your titles, your status, your honor, \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n your family, your nation etc, your ability to love god will be \n&gt; &gt; minimi=\r\nzed. If you de-focus the mind from all these things and focus it \n&gt; &gt; on go=\r\nd, you can love god more. Please note than I am not talking about \n&gt; &gt; inte=\r\nntionally ignoring or mistreating any of these. After all, they too \n&gt; &gt; ar=\r\ne a small aspect of god. But, stop the over-focus of the mind on these \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n things. Do what needs to be done to sustain them, but do not focus the \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; mind overly on them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whatever you see, think of and do, bring go=\r\nd into it. For example, \n&gt; &gt; suppose you are taking bath. Think of water as=\r\n an aspect of god. Be \n&gt; &gt; thankful to it and pour it on yourself with reve=\r\nrence and a sense of \n&gt; &gt; sacredness. Suppose you are eating food. Think of=\r\n food as an aspect of \n&gt; &gt; god. Be grateful to it and consume it with rever=\r\nence and a sense of \n&gt; &gt; sacredness. Suppose you are discussing something w=\r\nith a friend. Think of \n&gt; &gt; the friend as an aspect of god and deal with hi=\r\nm with a sense of \n&gt; &gt; sacredness. Suppose you are writing a software progr=\r\nam on the computer. \n&gt; &gt; Think of the computer and the work you do as an as=\r\npect of god and \n&gt; &gt; approach it with reverence and a sense of sacredness. =\r\nThis attitude can \n&gt; &gt; be extended to every activity.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When you do =\r\nhomam, think that god is indeed in the fire. Be thankful to \n&gt; &gt; fire and t=\r\no god. Whatever you offer and chant, do it with feeling. If \n&gt; &gt; you start =\r\nidentifying god in every perception, thought and action and \n&gt; &gt; bring awar=\r\neness of god to every moment of your life, you will realize \n&gt; &gt; the infini=\r\nte nature of god and love, devotion and surrender will \n&gt; &gt; automatically c=\r\nome.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In this situation i cant help =\r\nquestioning whether i am doing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam/puja/devotion\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or he is ge=\r\ntting it all done.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Good thinking! He is getting it done in reality=\r\n. But, if there is a \n&gt; &gt; sense of ownership inside you, then you are doing=\r\n it for all practical \n&gt; &gt; purposes.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ponder over this carefully: G=\r\nod is in everyone and does everything, but \n&gt; &gt; god gets things done throug=\r\nh a person, *in accordance with* the \n&gt; &gt; conditioning of that person. God =\r\nmakes each person experience good and \n&gt; &gt; bad things, *in accordance with*=\r\n what good and bad things he had earlier \n&gt; &gt; got done through that person.=\r\n Our conditioning influences what we do and \n&gt; &gt; what we do influence what =\r\nresults we experience. As long as we take \n&gt; &gt; different experiences differ=\r\nently and prefer some experiences to some \n&gt; &gt; others (despite pretending o=\r\nutwardly that we do not care), we do have \n&gt; &gt; some rawness (conditioning) =\r\nleft and need to use free will to overcome \n&gt; &gt; it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; BTW, Narayana Hridayam is very very powerful. Ideally, you a=\r\nre supposed \n&gt; &gt; to chant Lakshmi Hridayam after Narayana Hridayam and not =\r\njust chant \n&gt; &gt; Narayana Hridayam. Even if you repeat it many times, you ar=\r\ne supposed to \n&gt; &gt; chant Lakshmi Hridayam after Narayana Hridayam each time=\r\n. This is what \n&gt; &gt; tradition demands. Basically, Narayana is the Supreme C=\r\nosmic Self and \n&gt; &gt; Lakshmi is the manifested world arising out of Self. Yo=\r\nu cannot ignore \n&gt; &gt; the latter and only focus on the former.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *   =\r\n     *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Out of so many prayers I know, Narayana Hridayam-L=\r\nakshmi Hridayam is the \n&gt; &gt; one I feel the most attraction to.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I s=\r\npent a Friday in 2010 navaratris chanting Narayana Hridayam and \n&gt; &gt; Lakshm=\r\ni Hridayam for a whole day. I started long before sunrise, \n&gt; &gt; finished my=\r\n daily Chandi homam and then started a long homam with \n&gt; &gt; Narayana Hriday=\r\nam and Lakshmi Hridayam. I kept repeating them and did \n&gt; &gt; homam till 2:30=\r\n pm or so (I did not count how many times I repeated \n&gt; &gt; them. It is bette=\r\nr that way!). I had two fistfuls of food and then went \n&gt; &gt; back. Instead o=\r\nf homam now, I spent the second half of the day chanting \n&gt; &gt; Narayana Hrid=\r\nayam and Lakshmi Hridayam. I continued till the night. \n&gt; &gt; (Spending one w=\r\nhole day doing a specific mantra or prayer like this is a \n&gt; &gt; nice sadhana=\r\n and others may consider it.)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It was very nice, especially when I =\r\nwas doing homam. A very nice and \n&gt; &gt; intense state, where it feels like ev=\r\nery part of my body and mind is \n&gt; &gt; about to explode into an unlimited sta=\r\nte (it is tough to describe and \n&gt; &gt; find the right words), which I experie=\r\nnced before only when in deep \n&gt; &gt; meditation with a still body, was experi=\r\nenced for the first time while I \n&gt; &gt; was moving and my eyes were wide open=\r\n! In fact, that state lasted a long \n&gt; &gt; time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When one does homam=\r\n with a prayer one has a deep connection to, when one \n&gt; &gt; is able to ident=\r\nify with (or relate to) the prayer, when one brings \n&gt; &gt; feeling to one&#39;s p=\r\nrayer, and when one is focused very well and has a \n&gt; &gt; good level of devot=\r\nion, anything is possible with fire!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do I=\r\nt Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;          =\r\n          http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;       Films that make a differ=\r\nence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; &gt; ---=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
