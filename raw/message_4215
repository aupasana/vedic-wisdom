At the time of the prophet, there=\r\n were two super powers in the world: the Romans and the Persians with the E=\r\nthiopians a distant 3rd. Even they never conquered Arabia and the others th=\r\nought there was nothing there to conquer - not worth the effort. If Hindust=\r\nan was to reach Arabia, it would have had to cross the Persian empire, some=\r\nthing the Persian empire wouldn&#39;t have allowed, and they would have fight t=\r\nheir way across and there&#39;s no reports of war between the two: http://en.wi=\r\nkipedia.org/wiki/Sassanid_Empire\n&gt; \n&gt; A simple check would be to look at th=\r\ne Arabic language. Any people that have been conquered, taken on / adopt at=\r\n least some words of the conquering language, just look at Hindi or english=\r\n. Arabic is unique in that it is unlike any other - it is not a &#39;pidgin&#39; la=\r\nnguage where words have been adopted from other cultures.\n&gt; \n&gt; To find scri=\r\npture refering to a King Vikramaditya, does not &#39;prove beyond doubt&#39; that t=\r\nhat land belonged to his empire - it could simply be saying that there was =\r\na king once named Vikramaditya.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if the Kabaa was a Hindu temple, =\r\nit has been rebuilt many times (though always on the same location and for =\r\nthe same purpose) - both before and after the prophet, so to refer to it as=\r\n a Hindu temple is inaccurate.\n&gt; \n&gt; Howver does it really matter if Kaaba w=\r\nas a Hindu Temple or not?\n&gt; Why don&#39;t we establish a realtionship between H=\r\nindu and Muslim within a view to prosper India altogether rather than getti=\r\nng into such topic which could raise conflict between two brothers of same =\r\nfamily.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Wishes\n&gt; Varun Sharma\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; THIS WILL CHANGE AS WELL!\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Varun Sharma\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Don&#39;t cry=C2=A0because it&#39;s over, Smile coz=C2=\r\n=A0it happened. \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 21/4/10, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-=\r\nwisdom] Kaaba a Hindu Temple?\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: We=\r\ndnesday, 21 April, 2010, 6:02 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nNamaste Jitendra ji,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; This=C2=A0article have been floating in the=\r\n internet for quite some time, it&#39;s authenticity is questionable.

A Muslim resident of K=\r\nuwait requested historical research material that can help explain the conn=\r\nection between Hindu civilisation and Arabia.] \n&gt; Was the Kaaba Originally =\r\na Hindu Temple?\n&gt; By P.N. Oak (Historian) \n&gt; Glancing through some research=\r\n material recently, I was pleasantly surprised to come across a reference t=\r\no a king Vikramaditya inscription found in the Kaaba in Mecca proving beyon=\r\nd doubt that the Arabian Peninsula formed a part of his Indian Empire. \n&gt; T=\r\nhe text of the crucial Vikramaditya inscription, found inscribed on a gold =\r\ndish hung inside the Kaaba shrine in Mecca, is found recorded on page 315 o=\r\nf a volume known as =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 treasured in the Makhta=\r\nb-e-Sultania library in Istanbul, Turkey. Rendered in free English the insc=\r\nription says: \n&gt; &quot;Fortunate are those who were born (and lived) during king=\r\n Vikram=E2=80=99s reign. He was a noble, generous dutiful ruler, devoted to=\r\n the welfare of his subjects. But at that time we Arabs, oblivious of God, =\r\nwere lost in sensual pleasures. Plotting and torture were rampant. The dark=\r\nness of ignorance had enveloped our country. Like the lamb struggling for h=\r\ner life in the cruel paws of a wolf we Arabs were caught up in ignorance. T=\r\nhe entire country was enveloped in a darkness so intense as on a new moon n=\r\night. But the present dawn and pleasant sunshine of education is the result=\r\n of the favour of the noble king Vikramaditya whose benevolent supervision =\r\ndid not lose sight of us- foreigners as we were. He spread his sacred relig=\r\nion amongst us and sent scholars whose brilliance shone like that of the su=\r\nn from his country to ours. These scholars and preceptors through whose ben=\r\nevolence we were once again made cognisant of the presence of God, introduc=\r\ned to His sacred\n&gt;  existence and put on the road of Truth, had come to our=\r\n country to preach their religion and impart education at king Vikramaditya=\r\n=E2=80=99s behest.&quot; \n&gt; For those who would like to read the Arabic wording =\r\nI reproduce it hereunder in Roman script: \n&gt; &quot;Itrashaphai Santu Ibikramatul=\r\n Phahalameen Karimun Yartapheeha Wayosassaru Bihillahaya Samaini Ela Motaka=\r\nbberen Sihillaha Yuhee Quid min howa Yapakhara phajjal asari nahone osirom =\r\nbayjayhalem.

Because the inscription says that king Vikram who dispelled the darkness=\r\n of ignorance from Arabia. \n&gt; 2.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 That, whatev=\r\ner their earlier faith, King Vikrama=E2=80=99s preachers had succeeded in s=\r\npreading the Vedic (based on the Vedas, the Hindu sacred scriptures)) way o=\r\nf life in Arabia. \n&gt; 3.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 That the knowledge of=\r\n Indian arts and sciences was imparted by Indians to the Arabs directly by =\r\nfounding schools, academies and cultural centres. The belief, therefore, th=\r\nat visiting Arabs conveyed that knowledge to their own lands through their =\r\nown indefatigable efforts and scholarship is unfounded. \n&gt; An ancillary con=\r\nclusion could be that the so-called Kutub Minar (in Delhi, India) could wel=\r\nl be king Vikramadiya=E2=80=99s tower commemorating his conquest of Arabia.=\r\n This conclusion is strengthened by two pointers. Firstly, the inscription =\r\non the iron pillar near the so-called Kutub Minar refers to the marriage of=\r\n the victorious king Vikramaditya to the princess of Balhika. This Balhika =\r\nis none other than the Balkh region in West Asia. It could be that Arabia w=\r\nas wrestled by king Vikramaditya from the ruler of Balkh who concluded a tr=\r\neaty by giving his daughter in marriage to the victor. Secondly, the townsh=\r\nip adjoining the so called Kutub Minar is named Mehrauli after Mihira who w=\r\nas the renowned astronomer-mathemat ician of king Vikram=E2=80=99s court. M=\r\nehrauli is the corrupt form of Sanskrit =E2=80=98Mihira-Awali=E2=80=99 sign=\r\nifying a row of houses raised for Mihira and his helpers and assistants wor=\r\nking on astronomical observations made from the tower. \n&gt; Having seen the f=\r\nar reaching and history shaking implications of the Arabic inscription conc=\r\nerning king Vikrama, we shall now piece together the story of its find. How=\r\n it came to be recorded and hung in the Kaaba in Mecca. What are the other =\r\nproofs reinforcing the belief that Arabs were once followers of the Indian =\r\nVedic way of life and that tranquillity and education were ushered into Ara=\r\nbia by king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s scholars, educationists from an uneasy p=\r\neriod of &quot;ignorance and turmoil&quot; mentioned in the inscription. \n&gt; In Istanb=\r\nul, Turkey, there is a famous library called Makhatab-e-Sultania , which is=\r\n reputed to have the largest collection of ancient West Asian literature. I=\r\nn the Arabic section of that library is an anthology of ancient Arabic poet=\r\nry. That anthology was compiled from an earlier work in A.D. 1742 under the=\r\n orders of the Turkish ruler Sultan Salim. \n&gt; The pages of that volume are =\r\nof Hareer =E2=80&quot; a kind of silk used for writing on. Each page has a decor=\r\native gilded border. That anthology is known as Sayar-ul-Okul. It is divide=\r\nd into three parts. The first part contains biographic details and the poet=\r\nic compositions of pre-Islamic Arabian poets. The second part embodies acco=\r\nunts and verses of poets of the period beginning just after prophet Mohamma=\r\nd=E2=80=99s times, up to the end of the Banee-Um-Mayya dynasty. The third p=\r\nart deals with later poets up to the end of Khalif Harun-al-Rashid=E2=80=99=\r\ns times. \n&gt; Abu Amir Asamai, an Arabian bard who was the poet Laureate of H=\r\narun-al-Rashid=E2=80=99s court, has compiled and edited the anthology. \n&gt; T=\r\nhe first modern edition of =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 was printed and =\r\npublished in Berlin in 1864. A subsequent edition is the one published in B=\r\neirut in 1932. \n&gt; The collection is regarded as the most important and auth=\r\noritative anthology of ancient Arabic poetry. It throws considerable light =\r\non the social life, customs, manners and entertainment modes of ancient Ara=\r\nbia. The book also contains an elaborate description of the ancient shrine =\r\nof Mecca, the town and the annual fair known as OKAJ which used to be held =\r\nevery year around the Kaaba temple in Mecca. This should convince readers t=\r\nhat the annual haj of the Muslims to the Kaaba is of earlier pre-Islamic co=\r\nngregation. \n&gt; But the OKAJ fair was far from a carnival. It provided a for=\r\num for the elite and the learned to discuss the social, religious, politica=\r\nl, literary and other aspects of the Vedic culture then pervading Arabia. =\r\n=E2=80=98Sayar-ul-Okul=E2=80=99 asserts that the conclusion reached at thos=\r\ne discussions were widely respected throughout Arabia. Mecca, therefore, fo=\r\nllowed the Varanasi tradition (of India) of providing a venue for important=\r\n discussions among the learned while the masses congregated there for spiri=\r\ntual bliss. The principal shrines at both Varanasi in India and at Mecca in=\r\n Arvasthan (Arabia) were Siva temples. Even to this day ancient Mahadev (Si=\r\nva) emblems can be seen. It is the Shankara (Siva) stone that Muslim pilgri=\r\nms reverently touch and kiss in the Kaaba. \n&gt; Arabic tradition has lost tra=\r\nce of the founding of the Kaaba temple. The discovery of the Vikramaditya i=\r\nnscription affords a clue. King Vikramaditya is known for his great devotio=\r\nn to Lord Mahadev (Siva). At Ujjain (India), the capital of Vikramaditya, e=\r\nxists the famous shrine of Mahankal, i.e., of Lord Shankara (Siva) associat=\r\ned with Vikramaditya. Since according to the Vikramaditya inscription he sp=\r\nread the Vedic religion, who else but he could have founded the Kaaba templ=\r\ne in Mecca? \n&gt; A few miles away from Mecca is a big signboard which bars th=\r\ne entry of any non-Muslim into the area. This is a reminder of the days whe=\r\nn the Kaaba was stormed and captured solely for the newly established faith=\r\n of Islam. The object in barring entry of non-Muslims was obviously to prev=\r\nent its recapture. \n&gt; As the pilgrim proceeds towards Mecca he is asked to =\r\nshave his head and beard and to don special sacred attire that consists of =\r\ntwo seamless sheets of white cloth. One is to be worn round the waist and t=\r\nhe other over the shoulders. Both these rites are remnants of the old Vedic=\r\n practice of entering Hindu temples clean- and with holy seamless white she=\r\nets. \n&gt; The main shrine in Mecca, which houses the Siva emblem, is known as=\r\n the Kaaba. It is clothed in a black shroud. That custom also originates fr=\r\nom the days when it was thought necessary to discourage its recapture by ca=\r\nmouflaging it. \n&gt; According to the Encyclopaedia Britannica, the Kaaba has =\r\n360 images. Traditional accounts mention that one of the deities among the =\r\n360 destroyed when the place was stormed, was that of Saturn; another was o=\r\nf the Moon and yet another was one called Allah. That shows that in the Kaa=\r\nba the Arabs worshipped the nine planets in pre-Islamic days. In India the =\r\npractice of =E2=80=98Navagraha=E2=80=99 puja, that is worship of the nine p=\r\nlanets, is still in vogue. Two of these nine are Saturn and Moon. \n&gt; In Ind=\r\nia the crescent moon is always painted across the forehead of the Siva symb=\r\nol. Since that symbol was associated with the Siva emblem in Kaaba it came =\r\nto be grafted on the flag of Islam. \n&gt; Another Hindu tradition associated w=\r\nith the Kaaba is that of the sacred stream Ganga (sacred waters of the Gang=\r\nes river). According to the Hindu tradition Ganga is also inseparable from =\r\nthe Shiva emblem as the crescent moon. Wherever there is a Siva emblem, Gan=\r\nga must co-exist. True to that association a sacred fount exists near the K=\r\naaba. Its water is held sacred because it has been traditionally regarded a=\r\ns Ganga since pre-Islamic times (Zam-Zam water). \n&gt; [Note: Even today, Musl=\r\nim pilgrims who go to the Kaaba for Haj regard this Zam-Zam water with reve=\r\nrence and take some bottled water with them as sacred water.] \n&gt; Muslim pil=\r\ngrims visiting the Kaaba temple go around it seven times. In no other mosqu=\r\ne does the circumambulation prevail. Hindus invariably circumambulate aroun=\r\nd their deities. This is yet another proof that the Kaaba shrine is a pre-I=\r\nslamic Indian Shiva temple where the Hindu practice of circumambulation is =\r\nstill meticulously observed. \n&gt; The practice of taking seven steps- known a=\r\ns Saptapadi in Sanskrit- is associated with Hindu marriage ceremony and fir=\r\ne worship. The culminating rite in a Hindu marriage enjoins upon the bride =\r\nand groom to go round the sacred fire four times (but misunderstood by many=\r\n as seven times). Since &quot;Makha&quot; means fire, the seven circumambulations als=\r\no prove that Mecca was the seat of Indian fire-worship in the West Asia. \n&gt;=\r\n It might come as a stunning revelation to many that the word =E2=80=98ALLA=\r\nH=E2=80=99 itself is Sanskrit. In Sanskrit language Allah, Akka and Amba ar=\r\ne synonyms. They signify a goddess or mother. The term =E2=80=98ALLAH=E2=80=\r\n=99 forms part of Sanskrit chants invoking goddess Durga, also known as Bha=\r\nvani, Chandi and Mahishasurmardini. The Islamic word for God is., therefore=\r\n, not an innovation but the ancient Sanskrit appellation retained and conti=\r\nnued by Islam. Allah means mother or goddess and mother goddess. \n&gt; One Kor=\r\nanic verse is an exact translation of a stanza in the Yajurveda. This was p=\r\nointed out by the great research scholar Pandit Satavlekar of Pardi in one =\r\nof his articles. \n&gt; [Note: Another scholar points out that the following te=\r\naching from the Koran is exactly similar to the teaching of the Kena Upanis=\r\nhad (1.7). \n&gt; The Koran: \n&gt; &quot;Sight perceives Him not. But He perceives men&#39;=\r\ns sights; for He is the knower of secrets, the Aware.&quot; \n&gt; Kena Upanishad: \n=\r\n&gt; &quot;That which cannot be seen by the eye but through which the eye itself se=\r\nes, know That to be Brahman (God) and not what people worship here (in the =\r\nmanifested world).&quot; \n&gt; A simplified meaning of both the above verses reads:=\r\n \n&gt; God is one and that He is beyond man&#39;s sensory experience. \n&gt; The ident=\r\nity of Unani and Ayurvedic systems shows that Unani is just the Arabic term=\r\n for the Ayurvedic system of healing taught to them and administered in Ara=\r\nbia when Arabia formed part of the Indian empire. \n&gt; It will now be easy to=\r\n comprehend the various Hindu customs still prevailing in West Asian countr=\r\nies even after the existence of Islam during the last 1300 years. Let us re=\r\nview some Hindu traditions which exist as the core of Islamic practice. \n&gt; =\r\nThe Hindus have a pantheon of 33 gods. People in Asia Minor too worshipped =\r\n33 gods before the spread of Islam. The lunar calendar was introduced in We=\r\nst Asia during the Indian rule. The Muslim month =E2=80=98Safar=E2=80=99 si=\r\ngnifying the =E2=80=98extra=E2=80=99 month (Adhik Maas) in the Hindu calend=\r\nar. The Muslim month Rabi is the corrupt form of Ravi meaning the sun becau=\r\nse Sanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 changes into Prakrit =E2=80=98B=E2=80=99 (P=\r\nrakrit being the popular version of Sanskrit language). The Muslim sanctity=\r\n for Gyrahwi Sharif is nothing but the Hindu Ekadashi (Gyrah =3D elevan or =\r\nGyaarah). Both are identical in meaning. \n&gt; The Islamic practice of Bakari =\r\nEed derives from the Go-Medh and Ashva-Medh Yagnas or sacrifices of Vedic t=\r\nimes. Eed in Sanskrit means worship. The Islamic word Eed for festive days,=\r\n signifying days of worship, is therefore a pure Sanskrit word. The word ME=\r\nSH in the Hindu zodiac signifies a lamb. Since in ancient times the year us=\r\ned to begin with the entry of the sun in Aries, the occasion was celebrated=\r\n with mutton feasting. That is the origin of the Bakari Eed festival. \n&gt; [N=\r\note: The word Bakari is an Indian language word for a goat.] \n&gt; Since Eed m=\r\neans worship and Griha means =E2=80=98house=E2=80=99, the Islamic word Idga=\r\nh signifies a =E2=80=98House of worship=E2=80=99 which is the exact Sanskri=\r\nt connotation of the term. Similarly the word =E2=80=98Namaz=E2=80=99 deriv=\r\nes from two Sanskrit roots =E2=80=98Nama=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98Yajna=E2=80=\r\n=99 (NAMa yAJna) meaning bowing and worshipping. \n&gt; Vedic descriptions abou=\r\nt the moon, the different stellar constellations and the creation of the un=\r\niverse have been incorporated from the Vedas in Koran part 1 chapter 2, sta=\r\nnza 113, 114, 115, and 158, 189, chapter 9, stanza 37 and chapter 10, stanz=\r\nas 4 to 7. \n&gt; Recital of the Namaz five times a day owes its origin to the =\r\nVedic injunction of Panchmahayagna (five daily worship- Panch-Maha-Yagna) w=\r\nhich is part of the daily Vedic ritual prescribed for all individuals. \n&gt; M=\r\nuslims are enjoined cleanliness of five parts of the body before commencing=\r\n prayers. This derives from the Vedic injuction =E2=80=98Shareer Shydhyarth=\r\nam Panchanga Nyasah=E2=80=99. \n&gt; Four months of the year are regarded as ve=\r\nry sacred in Islamic custom. The devout are enjoined to abstain from plunde=\r\nr and other evil deeds during that period. This originates in the Chaturmas=\r\na i.e., the four-month period of special vows and austerities in Hindu trad=\r\nition. Shabibarat is the corrupt form of Shiva Vrat and Shiva Ratra. Since =\r\nthe Kaaba has been an important centre of Shiva (Siva) worship from times i=\r\nmmemorial, the Shivaratri festival used to be celebrated there with great g=\r\nusto. It is that festival which is signified by the Islamic word Shabibarat=\r\n. \n&gt; Encyclopaedias tell us that there are inscriptions on the side of the =\r\nKaaba walls. What they are, no body has been allowed to study, according to=\r\n the correspondence I had with an American scholar of Arabic. But according=\r\n to hearsay at least some of those inscriptions are in Sanskrit, and some o=\r\nf them are stanzas from the Bhagavad Gita. \n&gt; According to extant Islamic r=\r\necords, Indian merchants had settled in Arabia, particularly in Yemen, and =\r\ntheir life and manners deeply influenced those who came in touch with them.=\r\n At Ubla there was a large number of Indian settlements. This shows that In=\r\ndians were in Arabia and Yemen in sufficient strength and commanding positi=\r\non to be able to influence the local people. This could not be possible unl=\r\ness they belonged to the ruling class. \n&gt; It is mentioned in the Abadis i.e=\r\n., the authentic traditions of Prophet Mohammad compiled by Imam Bukhari th=\r\nat the Indian tribe of Jats had settled in Arabia before Prophet Mohammad=\r\n=E2=80=99s times. Once when Hazrat Ayesha, wife of the Prophet, was taken i=\r\nll, her nephew sent for a Jat physician for her treatment. This proves that=\r\n Indians enjoyed a high and esteemed status in Arabia. Such a status could =\r\nnot be theirs unless they were the rulers. Bukhari also tells us that an In=\r\ndian Raja (king) sent a jar of ginger pickles to the Prophet. This shows th=\r\nat the Indian Jat Raja ruled an adjacent area so as to be in a position to =\r\nsend such an insignificant present as ginger pickles. The Prophet is said t=\r\no have so highly relished it as to have told his colleagues also to partake=\r\n of it. These references show that even during Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s t=\r\nimes Indians retained their influential role in Arabia, which was a dwindli=\r\nng legacy from Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s times. \n&gt; The Islamic term =E2=80=98E=\r\ned-ul-Fitr=E2=80=99 derives from the =E2=80=98Eed of Piters=E2=80=99 that i=\r\ns worship of forefathers in Sanskrit tradition. In India, Hindus commemorat=\r\ne their ancestors during the Pitr-Paksha that is the fortnight reserved for=\r\n their remembrance. The very same is the significance of =E2=80=98Eed-ul-Fi=\r\ntr=E2=80=99 (worship of forefathers) . \n&gt; The Islamic practice of observing=\r\n the moon rise before deciding on celebrating the occasion derives from the=\r\n Hindu custom of breaking fast on Sankranti and Vinayaki Chaturthi only aft=\r\ner sighting the moon. \n&gt; Barah Vafat, the Muslim festival for commemorating=\r\n those dead in battle or by weapons, derives from a similar Sanskrit tradit=\r\nion because in Sanskrit =E2=80=98Phiphaut=E2=80=99 is =E2=80=98death=E2=80=\r\n=99. Hindus observe Chayal Chaturdashi in memory of those who have died in =\r\nbattle. \n&gt; The word Arabia is itself the abbreviation of a Sanskrit word. T=\r\nhe original word is =E2=80=98Arabasthan=E2=80=99. Since Prakrit =E2=80=98B=\r\n=E2=80=99 is Sanskrit =E2=80=98V=E2=80=99 the original Sanskrit name of the=\r\n land is =E2=80=98Arvasthan=E2=80=99. =E2=80=98Arva=E2=80=99 in Sanskrit me=\r\nans a horse. Arvasthan signifies a land of horses., and as well all know, A=\r\nrabia is famous for its horses. \n&gt; This discovery changes the entire comple=\r\nxion of the history of ancient India. Firstly we may have to revise our con=\r\ncepts about the king who had the largest empire in history. It could be tha=\r\nt the expanse of king Vikramaditya=E2=80=99s empire was greater than that o=\r\nf all others. Secondly, the idea that the Indian empire spread only to the =\r\neast and not in the west beyond say, Afghanisthan may have to be abandoned.=\r\n Thirdly the effeminate and pathetic belief that India, unlike any other co=\r\nuntry in the world could by some age spread her benign and beatific cultura=\r\nl influence, language, customs, manners and education over distant lands wi=\r\nthout militarily conquering them is baseless. India did conquer all those c=\r\nountries physically wherever traces of its culture and language are still e=\r\nxtant and the region extended from Bali island in the south Pacific to the =\r\nBaltic in Northern Europe and from Korea to Kaaba. The only difference was =\r\nthat while Indian rulers\n&gt;  identified themselves with the local population=\r\n and established welfare states, Moghuls and others who ruled conquered lan=\r\nds perpetuated untold atrocities over the vanquished. \n&gt; =E2=80=98Sayar-ul-=\r\nOkul=E2=80=99 tells us that a pan-Arabic poetic symposium used to be held i=\r\nn Mecca at the annual Okaj fair in pre-Islamic times. All leading poets use=\r\nd to participate in it. \n&gt; Poems considered best were awarded prizes. The b=\r\nest-engraved on gold plate were hung inside the temple. Others etched on ca=\r\nmel or goatskin were hung outside. Thus for thousands of years the Kaaba wa=\r\ns the treasure house of the best Arabian poetic thought inspired by the Ind=\r\nian Vedic tradition. \n&gt; That tradition being of immemorial antiquity many p=\r\noetic compositions were engraved and hung inside and outside on the walls o=\r\nf the Kaaba. But most of the poems got lost and destroyed during the stormi=\r\nng of the Kaaba by Prophet Mohammad=E2=80=99s troops. The Prophet=E2=80=99s=\r\n court poet, Hassan-bin-Sawik, who was among the invaders, captured some of=\r\n the treasured poems and dumped the gold plate on which they were inscribed=\r\n in his own home. Sawik=E2=80=99s grandson, hoping to earn a reward carried=\r\n those gold plates to Khalif=E2=80=99s court where he met the well-known Ar=\r\nab scholar Abu Amir Asamai. The latter received from the bearer five gold p=\r\nlates and 16 leather sheets with the prize-winning poems engraved on them. =\r\nThe bearer was sent away happy bestowed with a good reward. \n&gt; On the five =\r\ngold plates were inscribed verses by ancient Arab poets like Labi Baynay, A=\r\nkhatab-bin- Turfa and Jarrham Bintoi. That discovery made Harun-al-Rashid o=\r\nrder Abu Amir to compile a collection of all earlier compositions. One of t=\r\nhe compositions in the collection is a tribute in verse paid by Jarrham Bin=\r\ntoi, a renowned Arab poet, to king Vikramaditya. Bintoi who lived 165 years=\r\n before Prophet Mohammad had received the highest award for the best poetic=\r\n compositions for three years in succession in the pan-Arabic symposiums he=\r\nld in Mecca every year. All those three poems of Bintoi adjudged best were =\r\nhung inside the Kaaba temple, inscribed on gold plates. One of these consti=\r\ntuted an unreserved tribute to King Vikramaditya for his paternal and filia=\r\nl rule over Arabia. That has already been quoted above. \n&gt; Pre-Islamic Arab=\r\nian poet Bintoi=E2=80=99s tribute to king Vikramaditya is a decisive eviden=\r\nce that it was king Vikramaditya who first conquered the Arabian Peninsula =\r\nand made it a part of the Indian Empire. This explains why starting from In=\r\ndia towards the west we have all Sanskrit names like Afghanisthan (now Afgh=\r\nanistan) , Baluchisthan, Kurdisthan, Tajikiathan, Uzbekisthan,=C2=A0 Iran, =\r\nSivisthan, Iraq, Arvasthan, Turkesthan (Turkmenisthan) etc. \n&gt; Historians h=\r\nave blundered in not giving due weight to the evidence provided by Sanskrit=\r\n names pervading over the entire west Asian region. Let us take a contempor=\r\nary instance. Why did a part of India get named Nagaland even after the end=\r\n of British rule over India? After all historical traces are wiped out of h=\r\numan memory, will a future age historian be wrong if he concludes from the =\r\nname Nagaland that the British or some English speaking power must have rul=\r\ned over India? Why is Portuguese spoken in Goa (part of India), and French =\r\nin Pondichery (part of India), and both French and English in Canada? Is it=\r\n not because those people ruled over the territories where their languages =\r\nare spoken? Can we not then justly conclude that wherever traces of Sanskri=\r\nt names and traditions exist Indians once held sway? It is unfortunate that=\r\n this important piece of decisive evidence has been ignored all these centu=\r\nries. \n&gt; Another question which should have presented itself to historians =\r\nfor consideration is how could it be that Indian empires could extend in th=\r\ne east as far as Korea and Japan, while not being able to make headway beyo=\r\nnd Afghanisthan? In fact land campaigns are much easier to conduct than by =\r\nsea. It was the Indians who ruled the entire West Asian region from Karachi=\r\n to Hedjaz and who gave Sanskrit names to those lands and the towns therein=\r\n, introduce their pantheon of the fire-worship, imparted education and esta=\r\nblished law and order. \n&gt; It may be that Arabia itself was not part of the =\r\nIndian empire until king Vikrama , since Bintoi says that it was king Vikra=\r\nma who for the first time brought about a radical change in the social, cul=\r\ntural and political life of Arabia. It may be that the whole of West Asia e=\r\nxcept Arabia was under Indian rule before Vikrama. The latter added Arabia =\r\ntoo to the Indian Empire. Or as a remote possibility it could be that king =\r\nVikramaditya himself conducted a series of brilliant campaigns annexing to =\r\nhis empire the vast region between Afghanisthan and Hedjaz. \n&gt; Incidentally=\r\n this also explains why king Vikramaditya is so famous in history. Apart fr=\r\nom the nobility and truthfulness of heart and his impartial filial affectio=\r\nn for all his subjects, whether Indian or Arab, as testified by Bintoi, kin=\r\ng Vikramaditya has been permanently enshrined in the pages of history becau=\r\nse he was the world=E2=80=99s greatest ruler having the largest empire. It =\r\nshould be remembered that only a monarch with a vast empire gets famous in =\r\nworld history. Vikram Samvat (calendar still widely in use in India today) =\r\nwhich he initiated over 2000 years ago may well mark his victory over Arabi=\r\na, and the so called Kutub Minar (Kutub Tower in Delhi), a pillar commemora=\r\nting that victory and the consequential marriage with the Vaihika (Balkh) p=\r\nrincess as testified by the nearby iron pillar inscription. \n&gt; A great many=\r\n puzzles of ancient world history get automatically solved by a proper unde=\r\nrstanding of these great conquests of king Vikramaditya. As recorded by the=\r\n Arab poet Bintoi, Indian scholars, preachers and social workers spread the=\r\n fire-worship ceremony, preached the Vedic way of life, manned schools, set=\r\n up Ayurvedic (healing) centres, trained the local people in irrigation and=\r\n agriculture and established in those regions a democratic, orderly, peacef=\r\nul, enlightened and religious way of life. That was of course, a Vedic Hind=\r\nu way of life. \n&gt; It is from such ancient times that Indian Kshtriya royal =\r\nfamilies, like the Pahalvis and Barmaks, have held sway over Iran and Iraq.=\r\n It is those conquests, which made the Parsees Agnihotris i.e., fire-worshi=\r\nppers. It is therefore that we find the Kurds of Kurdisthan speaking a Sans=\r\nkritised dialect, fire temples existing thousands of miles away from India,=\r\n and scores of sites of ancient Indian cultural centres like Navbahar in We=\r\nst Asia and the numerous viharas in Soviet Russia spread throughout the wor=\r\nld. Ever since so many viharas are often dug up in Soviet Russia, ancient I=\r\nndian sculptures are also found in excavations in Central Asia. The same go=\r\nes for West Asia. \n&gt; [Note: Ancient Indian sculptures include metal statues=\r\n of the Hindu deity Ganesh (the elephant headed god); the most recent find =\r\nbeing in Kuwait]. \n&gt; Unfortunately these chapters of world history have bee=\r\nn almost obliterated from public memory. They need to be carefully decipher=\r\ned and rewritten. When these chapters are rewritten they might change the e=\r\nntire concept and orientation of ancient history. \n&gt; In view of the overwhe=\r\nlming evidence led above, historians, scholars, students of history and lay=\r\n men alike should take note that they had better revise their text books of=\r\n ancient world history. The existence of Hindu customs, shrines, Sanskrit n=\r\names of whole regions, countries and towns and the Vikramaditya inscription=\r\ns reproduced at the beginning are a thumping proof that Indian Kshatriyas o=\r\nnce ruled over the vast region from Bali to Baltic and Korea to Kaaba in Me=\r\ncca, Arabia at the very least. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
