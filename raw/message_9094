Whatever ecological damage we face today can be attributed\nsignific=\r\nantly to this non-essential industry. (refer United Nations\ndocument on mea=\r\nt industry being culprit for climate change, land pollution,\nwater depletio=\r\nn and loss of biodiversity at\nhttp://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00=\r\n.htm)\n\n\n\n*Cause of hunger and poverty*\n\nBecause *meat is cause of hunger an=\r\nd poverty in the world.* Just as I\nmyself hate being hungry and under-nutri=\r\ntioned, I feel the same for\nmillions of my brothers and sisters born from s=\r\name mother earth. If I could\nhave killed myself to satisfy their hunger, I =\r\nwould have gladly done so.\n\nBut for all I know, if people stop eating meat =\r\nand adopt vegetarian ways, *they\ncould feed at least 10 times more people u=\r\nsing the same efforts and\nenergy.*This is based on the principle of energy-=\r\npyramid which states\nthat the at\nleast 10 units of vegetation is consumed t=\r\no prepare 1 unit of meat by\nfeeding the meat-producing animals. Refer any t=\r\next on food chain or energy\npyramid. In fact for most of the commercially p=\r\nroduced meat that humans eat\ncurrently, energy losses are much higher.\n\nThu=\r\ns each person who stops eating meat is feeding at least 9 more people\napart=\r\n from himself. *What could be a greater form of charity than simply\navoidin=\r\ng meat! *And what could be a greater sin for me than forcing at\nleast 9 peo=\r\nple to die from hunger because I love the taste of\nmutton! Moreover, meat i=\r\nndustry also significantly depletes water.\n\nSince I consider entire humanit=\r\ny as my own family, I cannot sleep\npeacefully with the guilt of being a cau=\r\nse of hunger and thirst for my\ndearest brothers and sisters and innocent ch=\r\nildren in my global home.\n\n\n\n*Vegetarian alternatives exist*\n\nBecause in to=\r\nday=92s era, I don=92t see anybody hunting to survive like the\nlions in Afr=\r\nica. Meat is simply a non-essential addiction. *There is no\nmeat-product fo=\r\nr which a healthier vegetarian alternative does not exist.*\n\n\n\n*Meat is non=\r\n-renewable*\n\nBecause meat is non-renewable. An animal once killed cannot gr=\r\now more\nanimals. But a plant, even when uprooted, can grow a new plant from=\r\n its\nroots, shoots and seeds. Thus the hunger and thirst caused by meat-eat=\r\ning\nis much more longer term and intense than that discussed earlier.\n\n\n\n*L=\r\nife is Beautiful*\n\nBecause I consider my life to be dearest to me. I consid=\r\ner life of my near\nand dear ones to be most precious. I see all humans cons=\r\nidering lives of\ntheir near and dear ones equally precious. If I kill any o=\r\nf them, *I am\ndeemed a murderer because I snatched the most precious gift o=\r\nf life.*\n\nSo how can I commit the same crime on other species who too have =\r\na face and\nbrain like me, who also love their life so much, who also face t=\r\nhe same\nfear when they approach death, who also express happiness and grief=\r\n like me\nand my dear ones? Simply because I do not understand their languag=\r\ne or\nconsider them less intelligent? By this logic, even killing of\nmental-=\r\npatients should also be legitimized. Killing of coma patients should\nalso b=\r\ne legitimized. Eating orphans should also be legitimized.\n\nAnd since they a=\r\nre not, even meat eating is a crime of same order for me.\n\n\n\n*Question: The=\r\nn should you not stop eating plants also? After all, even\nthey have life, a=\r\ns proved by science.*\n\n*Answer*: Research has only proved that plants also =\r\ndemonstrate similar\nprocesses and cellular structures that are found in ani=\r\nmals. Science does\nnot say that plants have a personality like animals. The=\r\nre is no way to\nprove that plants exhibit same form of sorrow or joy or put=\r\n efforts like\nanimals. Plants don=92t reproduce in a manner similar to anim=\r\nals or stop\nbeing able to reproduce more plants like animals after they are=\r\n killed. *There\nare significant differences in plants and animals, and that=\r\n is why even\nscience of biology clearly differentiates study of botany and =\r\nzoology. *\n\nSo I do not consider plants to have a soul that feels =93I am t=\r\nhis mango\ntree=94. This coupled with reasons discussed above justify eating=\r\n of plants,\nbut not of animals.\n\nBut even if we assume that plants can feel=\r\n pain like animals. Still, we can\nlive without eating animals. *But we cann=\r\not live without eating plants.* We\nsimply do not have a choice here. And by=\r\n eating plants, at least 10 times\nmore humans in our family can get food to=\r\n eat and water to drink that by\ntasting a beef-steak. Thus commonsense and =\r\nbasic humanity demands that we\nshow mercy on those at least whom we can all=\r\now to live without killing\nourselves and torturing our family members. Or e=\r\nlse, same reason may be\ngiven tomorrow to justify cannibalism as well.\n\n\n\n*=\r\nQuestion: Even lions and tigers eat meat. So what is wrong if humans eat?*\n=\r\n\n*Answer*: Lions and tigers and other carnivorous animals eat meat because =\r\n*they\nare designed by nature to do so.* If they do not eat so, they would d=\r\nie.\nThey are not in a position to think, analyze, choose and decide what to=\r\n\neat, what not to eat, whether to eat in a plate or in a bowl, whether to\nc=\r\nook or not cook, whether to mix 5 varieties of meat with some toppings or\ne=\r\nat plain and raw, whether to cook in Tandoor or roast. Since humans\npossess=\r\n this finesse, *question of right and wrong also is relevant to\nhumans alon=\r\ne.*\n\nNow humans have a choice of food =96 animals or plants. There is 100%\n=\r\nevidence that eating of animals causes hunger, pollutes nature and is at\npa=\r\nr with eating humans. Further eating animals is optional. So a sensible\nper=\r\nson like me will not eat animals. On plants, there is controversy.\nPeople l=\r\nike me believe that they are chemical reactions and not souls with\npersonal=\r\nities. Others may differ. But in absence of conclusive proof for\nlatter, it=\r\n would be still wiser to prefer them for food instead of animals\nand be les=\r\ns criminals in worst case. Further we do not even have a choice\nin this cas=\r\ne.\n\nSay you are forced to drink from one of the two bottles. One is confirm=\r\ned\nto contain deadly poison. And opening the bottle will definitely kill 10=\r\n\nother people. For other, there is a confusion on it being poison and no on=\r\ne\nelse gets killed. What would you choose? *At least, I would choose the\nse=\r\ncond bottle without second thoughts.* Same is that case with eating\nplants =\r\n=96 the natural, humane way of eating.\n\n\n\n*Question: But I am an atheist. I=\r\n do not believe in soul or God. So plants\nor animals are all similar bioche=\r\nmical reactions. Why should I\ndifferentiate?*\n\n*Answer*: If you are an athe=\r\nist or agnostic, *there is all the more reason\nwhy you should eat plants bu=\r\nt not animals.* Because I assume you admit that\nyou are a human. And being =\r\na human, I assume, you agree that hurting other\nhumans is not acceptable in=\r\n any rational society. I assume that you love\nyour fellow human beings. I a=\r\nssume you consider humanity to be your own\nfamily. I assume you care for ea=\r\nch and every innocent human being. And\nhence, I assume you would want to ke=\r\nep at least 9 people hungry and thirsty\nwhile you relish on chicken-tikka. =\r\nAnd you would not like our future\ngenerations to be permanently diseased an=\r\nd in poverty simply because we\nhave been screwing up the environment. I ass=\r\nume that you indeed love your\nchildren and would love to gift them with ble=\r\nssings than curse them with\nhatred. If my assumptions are correct, then an =\r\natheist must be frontrunner\nfor =93Say No to Meat=94 campaign. *If my assum=\r\nptions are wrong, then even\neating up an atheist is equally justified.*\n\n\n\n=\r\n*Question: Then even domestication of animals and drinking milk should be\nc=\r\nrime?*\n\n*Answer*: Well, these are ambiguous topics. There can be views and =\r\ncounter\nviews. One can discuss and debate on these. But regardless of that,=\r\n at\nleast this is certain that if these were to be crime, *then killing of\n=\r\nanimals is bound to be a crime of much muchbhigher magnitude.* So at least\n=\r\nwe should avoid conducting such great crimes against nature, humanity and\na=\r\nnimals, even if we differ on these few issues.\n\nFor example, we cannot just=\r\nify killing of human beings on pretext that a\nlesser crime called =91corpor=\r\nate fraud=92 is not clearly defined in law. For\nsomeone who raises a questi=\r\non that domestication of animals and drinking of\nmilk are also crimes, ther=\r\ne is all the more reason why such a person should\nbe torch-bearer of moveme=\r\nnt for compassion on animals and promote\nvegetarianism.\n\n\n\n*Question: What =\r\nwill I eat if I am in a place where I only get meat? For\nexample, if I am s=\r\ntranded on an island or am in Antarctica.*\n\n*Answer*: This is a very intere=\r\nsting question! Tell me, how many times you\nhave actually been in Antarctic=\r\na or have been stranded on an island like\nRobinson Crusoe? This very questi=\r\non implies that you agree that\n*EXCEPT*when you are stranded on an island o=\r\nr a place where you must\neat meat to\nsurvive, in all other situations, you =\r\nshould not eat meat.\n\nOK So we give you this concession. When you become Ro=\r\nbinson Crusoe, eat\nmeat if you indeed believe so. But 99.9999% of human inh=\r\nabitations and\nsituations don=92t demand you to be a Robinson Crusoe! You g=\r\net ample non-meat\nfood in almost all locations where humans live as a socie=\r\nty. After all the\nanimals they eat also eventually have to eat plants. (All=\r\n food-chains do\nbegin with plants. There is no animal that converts solar e=\r\nnergy into\nbio-energy. Only plants can do that.)\n\n\n\n*Question: What about e=\r\nggs? Eggs are good for health and even government\npromotes eating of eggs.*=\r\n\n\n*Answer*: Government is also mired in scam charges. Just because governme=\r\nnt\npromotes something does not make it rational. Had that been the case, th=\r\nere\nwould have been never a movement against scams and for change of govern=\r\nance!\n\nComing to eggs, have you ever been in a poultry farm? The way these =\r\neggs\nare produced by ruthlessly torturing the chickens can raise your hairs=\r\n\n(assuming you have compassion). Further, it is one of the most unhygienic\n=\r\nlocations. If you consider that humans should also be motivated to eat shit=\r\n\nafter picking from comode and serving on a beautiful plate, then perhaps\ny=\r\nou have at least one lame reason to defend egg-eating. Because the most\nmod=\r\nern and expensive egg-farms are no more hygienic than a dirty toilet in\na d=\r\nirty bus-stop of Karachi. *(By the way, the most hygienic of the\nmeat-farms=\r\n are even more dirty.)*\n\nAlso, there is no special nutrient in eggs that is=\r\n not available in plants\nin ample. In fact eggs don=92t even come close to =\r\nbe termed nutritious\ncompared to common plant food.* Eating pulses would be=\r\n a much wiser* and\nnature-friendly option than invite diseases and destroy =\r\nenvironment for\neating womb of a bird.\n\n\n\n*Question: If we stop eating anim=\r\nals, will not their numbers grow up and\nfill the entire earth? We must kill=\r\n animals to preserve natural balance.*\n\n*Answer*: This is perhaps the *cute=\r\nst cruel question* I have ever heard in\nmy life. Cute because it seems as i=\r\nf an innocent child who first learnt\nabout nature in his pre-school has fra=\r\nmed the question. Cruel because one\nis attempting to project himself as Rob=\r\ninhood who kills to save the planet!\n\nBut let=92s face the reality. *How ma=\r\nny if us actually eat animals because of\nour genuine concern for nature?* H=\r\now many of us are indeed\nenvironmentalists? Or is it merely tingling of our=\r\n taste-buds that we want\nto satisfy by hook or crook?\n\nComing to facts, thi=\r\ns argument would have been valid had humans as a race\nwould have been eatin=\r\ng meat exclusively through hunting like lions and\ntigers. Now lions and tig=\r\ners do not create farmhouses to rear deer and\nsheep so that they can have a=\r\n ready supply of food.\n\nHumans on contrary have created a huge commercial i=\r\nndustry to\n*PRODUCE*meat-providing animals and then kill them to fulfil the=\r\nir\ntastes. 99% of\nhumans actually *GROW* the animals they kill. And in proc=\r\ness of this\ngrowth, they destroy the nature like anything.\n\nThus this cruel=\r\n question puts the enquirer at par with Osama Bin Laden who\njustifies his t=\r\nerror attacks as service to humanity! *(This is a hard truth\nthat most terr=\r\norists seriously believe that they are serving humanity and\nGod by killing =\r\nothers!)*\n\nBy the way, humans do not eat all the animals and birds. Humans =\r\ndon=92t eat\ncarnivorous animals for example. Most humans don=92t eat crows,=\r\n vultures,\njackals or scorpions. Why they have not filled the entire earth =\r\nthen?\n\nAlso, this line of thinking can be extended to allow cooking up term=\r\ninally\nill and aged humans. After all, we all are trained since childhood t=\r\no cite\npopulation as the greatest problem facing us.\n\nSomeone who has studi=\r\ned ecology at even basic level will not give such\nunscientific arguments an=\r\nd invite ridicule.\n\nOn contrary meat industry has endangered many species t=\r\no extinction. So if\npreservation of natural balance of population be the ov=\r\nerriding selfless\ngoal, then do not think even a second to adopt vegetarian=\r\nism.\n\n\n\n*Question: To kill other animals is a natural phenomenon. All power=\r\nful\nanimals kill to eat. So what is wrong if humans also act naturally?*\n\n*=\r\nAnswer*: First, as discussed earlier, no animal ever grows animals. No\nanim=\r\nal constructs poultry farms and butcher houses. They simply follow\ntheir hu=\r\nnger instincts on need basis.\n\nSecond, the most powerful animals are primar=\r\nily vegetarians. Be it\nelephant, or horse, or hippopotamus, or wild buffalo=\r\n, or rhino, or gorilla.\n\nThird, animals also live nude, do not read poems, =\r\ndo not clean their parts\nafter shit and do not do a lot of things that huma=\r\nns do. They also do not\ncook meat before eating. If meat-eating was so natu=\r\nral for humans, then\nmost of us would have been relishing raw meat without =\r\nusing spoons and\nforks.\n\n*Humans were designed to be intelligent*. To be ab=\r\nle to judge and decide\nwhat is wrong and what is right. To be compassionate=\r\n. To be loyal. To be\nrational. *Thus, if indeed humans want to be =91natura=\r\nl=92, they should protect\nand not torture animals.*\n\nAnd if this logic be c=\r\nonsidered seriously, then even cannibalism is also\nnatural if practiced by =\r\npowerful humans. Of course, there remains no basis\nfor anti-corruption move=\r\nment. After all it is natural for the more powerful\nto trample those who ar=\r\ne less powerful, as per the enquirer!\n\nBut lets be human.\n\nLets accept it, =\r\nthis is a *beast-mindset* and not human way of thinking.\nHumanity is about =\r\nanalysis, *love, compassion and urge to protect the less\npowerful.* These t=\r\nraits alone make humans so special and different from\nanimals.\n\n\n\n*Question=\r\n: Biologically, humans are designed to eat animals. Look at our\nteeth, our =\r\nintestines. We don=92t have organs to digest cellulose like\nherbivorous ani=\r\nmals. Hence are we not designed to eat animals?*\n\n*Answer*: Yet another lam=\r\ne excuse to justify cravings of tongue. Humans are\ndesigned to be separate =\r\nfrom both herbivores and carnivores. Unlike\nherbivores, humans cannot diges=\r\nt grass. That is why we are not\ngrass-eaters. But unlike carnivores, we are=\r\n also not designed to eat raw\nmeat. So we don=92t have huge canines like li=\r\non and tiger. Human canines are\nat best good for peeling sugarcanes *(Consu=\r\nlt your dentist before you\nattempt so though. If you have been eating too m=\r\nuch of junk, then sugarcane\nmay peel off your teeth instead!)*.\n\nIf meat wa=\r\ns so natural to us, we would have naturally been eating uncooked\nmeat. By c=\r\nhasing, hunting, killing and eating away an animal using\nfingernails and te=\r\neth alone. We would not have required to tie or imprison\nthe animal and the=\r\nn kill it using special weapons. No animal does that.\n\nOn contrary, fruits =\r\nand vegetables can be eaten uncooked. In fact many\nhealth-regimes focus on =\r\npurely uncooked-diet. But meat demands use of fire.\nThe fire is used so tha=\r\nt meat is converted to a more acceptable form. These\ndays a raw meat concep=\r\nt is on rage in some places. But medical advice is to\nhave it cooked to ens=\r\nure there is no infection. And most humans find even\nthe mention of raw mea=\r\nt very disgusting. After all we were designed by\nnature to be not cruel.\n\n*=\r\nSo if biology is your inspiration, be a vegetarian*. Our brain, body,\nintel=\r\nlect and emotions were designed only to be compassionate humans.\n\n\n\n*Questi=\r\non: But I live in a family and society where meat is predominant\nfood. How =\r\ncan I suddenly stop eating meat and appear crazy in my group?*\n\n*Answer*: T=\r\nhis is a more honest question. It is indeed an issue with many\ngenuine hone=\r\nst people who are forced to eat meat due to peer pressure. The\nway out is t=\r\no rethink the same issue from a different perspective.\n\n*J**ust assume for =\r\na second that you are among a group of cannibals who\nwant to eat your famil=\r\ny members. *Would you enjoy feasting with them and\neating away leg of your =\r\ndaughter, finger of your mother and intestine of\nyour brother with masala c=\r\nurry?\n\nA rational human being considers all living beings as his own family=\r\n. But\neven if you consider all humans as your own family, still meat eating=\r\n means\nyou are killing at least ten of your own family members.\n\nThus, *if =\r\nwe simply start considering the Mother Nature as our mother\nindeed, problem=\r\n is solved. *Then we care for Mother Nature like we care for\nour own mother=\r\n. Then we are deeply touched at hunger and poverty of our own\nbrothers and =\r\nsisters across the globe, and would not be party to anything\nthat makes so =\r\nmany innocents die and suffer due to lack of food. So instead\nof being some=\r\none ashamed of your honesty, you become an agent of positive\nchange. Instea=\r\nd of fearing that you appear crazy, you feel proud that you\nare the most se=\r\nnsible.\n\n\n\n*Question: Does it mean all meat-eaters are murderers and should=\r\n be hated?*\n\n*Answer*: Technically, first part of the question is yes. Anyo=\r\nne who is in\nanyway instrumental to death of an innocent is indeed a  culpr=\r\nit. But we\ndisagree that they should be hated. Meat-eating is a cultural is=\r\nsue today.\nCultural issues are tackled through sensitisation and awareness =\r\nand not\nthrough Talibanization and hatred. Remember, the entire foundation =\r\nof\nmovement against meat-eating lies in *compassion and genuine concern for=\r\n\nall living beings*. So we should eradicate this brutal practice through\nhu=\r\nmane means.\n\nWe do agree that law should be appropriately formulated to dis=\r\ncourage\nmeat-eating and promote healthy environment-friendly human-friendly=\r\n habits\nlike plant-eating. But not through any feeling of hatred towards an=\r\nyone. We\nall humans are one single family. We should love each other and en=\r\ncourage\neach other for improvements. So even if you eat meat, I still love =\r\nyou as a\nmother loves her new-born calf. And that is why I appeal to you to=\r\n say not\nto meat.\n\n\n\n*Question: What would then happen of so many meat-rear=\r\ning farms and\nindustries? Would it not cause people in these industries to =\r\nbecome\nunemployed?*\n\n*Answer*: No, they would become even more productive. =\r\nInstead of meat, if\nthey start producing plant food, they can feed at least=\r\n 10 times more\npeople with same investments. And hence this would boost the=\r\n economy like\nanything and bring prosperity to all. And future generations =\r\nwill thank\nthem for gifting them a less-polluted environment and a less-hun=\r\ngry life.\n\n\n\n*Question: If meat-eating was so unnatural, why humans started=\r\n eating meat\nin first place?*\n\n*Answer*: Exactly the same question can be p=\r\nosed for crimes like murder,\nfraud, racism, gender-discrimination, terroris=\r\nm and rape. Any evil breeds\non ignorance and lack of education. Even if you=\r\n look into Bible, it states\nthat originally all humans were plant-eaters (G=\r\nenesis 1.29 for example).\n\nVedas =96 *the oldest books known to humanity* =\r\n=96 vociferously suggest\nnon-meat diet for humans. The first mantra of Yaju=\r\nrveda itself begins with\nan advise to protect the animals.\n\nOver ages, due =\r\nto lack of wisdom, lack of development, violent periods etc,\nthere was an i=\r\nncentive to focus only on immediate needs than think smartly.\nOr blindly ap=\r\ne old customs in name of religion or culture. Hence\nmeat-eating became as p=\r\nrevalent as gender-discrimination or racism etc.\n\nWhen we plan our present =\r\nand future, we are not at all bothered about why\nwe did not do something in=\r\n past. We simply rationally evaluate the benefits\nin present and future, an=\r\nd plan accordingly. That is why we use laptops,\nspeak on mobile phones, wat=\r\nch TV and travel in planes and trains even\nthough human civilisation never =\r\nhad these ever before. *What we should be\nbothered today is not why somethi=\r\nng happened in past.* We should instead\nfocus on what we need to do right n=\r\now to save our lovely planet and bring\nnourishment for teeming billions tha=\r\nt are facing punishment for our\ncravings of tongue. We should focus on what=\r\n we must do today to not be a\nvillain torturing our own lovely children tom=\r\norrow.\n\n\n\n*Question: I thought you would argue as animal-rights activist an=\r\nd I would\nquestion why you are not being a plants-right activist. You inste=\r\nad started\narguing as human-rights activist. How do I counter you then?*\n\n*=\r\nAnswer*:\n\n1. The way Supreme Lord has designed this world, if one genuinely=\r\n starts\ncaring for humans alone, then care for animals would chip in automa=\r\ntically.\nAfter all this is just a marvellously symbiotic world where everyt=\r\nhing is\ninterrelated. *You get back what you give. *\n\n2. Why do you need to=\r\n counter something which is so obvious and intuitive?\nLet us admit that *me=\r\nat-eating is a social-evil* that thrives from\ndark-ages like gender discrim=\r\nination, racism etc. It is hardly a century\nago that we gave voting rights =\r\nto women. Racism and casteism were legally\nuprooted hardly a few decades ag=\r\no. Still movement against these evils\ncontinue. So we are not as evolved as=\r\n technological advances may make us\nbelieve. Let us take meat-eating as nex=\r\nt evil to tackle, given the\nappalling situation of environment and given th=\r\ne poverty statistics of the\nworld. *We should realise that each bite of mea=\r\nt we relish makes one poor\ndie somewhere in world. And making earth closer =\r\nto hell for our children\nwhom we love the most.*\n\n3. For those who indeed a=\r\nre rational and compassionate, this is indeed also\nan animal-rights issues.=\r\n We inherited this *tribal mentality somehow that\nthe whole world is design=\r\ned exclusively for us =96 the humans. *This lust\nmade us destroy the enviro=\r\nnment and start considering the entire earth as\nour personal consort. And w=\r\nithin last century, the situation has turned so\nworse that scientists are n=\r\now worried about what would happen about our\nbasic necessities of food, lan=\r\nd and water in times to come.\n\nIn medieval times, the lust made us to disre=\r\ngard women as inferior to men\nin name of even religion. Women, like animals=\r\n, were considered by many\npriests to have no soul. Others considered them t=\r\no be half-intelligent than\nmen and impure.\n\nMany other people, like =93blac=\r\nks=94 were considered fit to be slave alone.\nThen in last few decades, the =\r\nenlightened ones took a journey backwards to\nrectify the blunders. We thus =\r\nuprooted racism and casteism. We started\nconsidering women as equal to men =\r\nin social, intellectual and political\nrights. And now it is time to take th=\r\ne journey a step further and show our\nconcern for animals as well. All thes=\r\ne concerns =96 human-rights,\ngender-rights, animal-rights =96 are part of s=\r\name spectrum and caused out of\nsame ignorance in human mind. *So the evolve=\r\nd ones should work to take this\nnext step.*\n\nAnd even those societies that =\r\nare yet to do their homework on gender-rights\nand human-rights also could e=\r\nxpedite their progress if they holistically\nincorporate animal-rights as we=\r\nll.\n\nBut even if they do not, the dangerous situations of today force any\nr=\r\national person to embrace animal-rights. As a means to fulfil demands of\ngr=\r\nave human-rights issues like poverty of teeming billions and damage of\nenvi=\r\nronment guaranteeing a dangerous future for our children.\n\nSo do not counte=\r\nr the light of truth. Be honest, be humble and be rational.\nLove others as =\r\nyou expect others to love you. The least you can do to\nshowcase your love f=\r\nor your own brothers and sisters and children of future\nis to replace that =\r\nchicken-soup with tomato-soup.\n\n*Be human, love humans.*\n\n*Say no to meat!*=\r\n\n\nAnd remember, *you get back what you give.*\n\nVedas, the oldest texts know=\r\nn to humans and divine word for millions\ncategorically state that animals a=\r\nre to be loved, not killed. Hundreds of\nMantras in Vedas clearly assert tha=\r\nt only vegetarian diet is meant for\nhumans. The very first Mantra of Yajurv=\r\neda commands all nobles to defend\nanimals. You may visit this link to get c=\r\nopy of complete set of 4 Vedas in\nHindi http://agnikart.com/in/special-offe=\r\nrs/complete-set-of-4-vedas-hindi\n\nPS: We did not take up the issue of healt=\r\nh hazards of eating meat. This has\nbeen amply covered in many researches. T=\r\no summarise, meat eating is cause\nof dreaded diseases like swine flu, mad c=\r\now and bird flu. It increases risk\nof cancer, heart disease and diabetes. A=\r\n habit that takes innocent lives,\npromotes hunger, destroys future of child=\r\nren cannot bring positive impact\nin our lives. You cannot meditate properly=\r\n if you eat meat. Food has\ngreatest impact on state of your mind, after you=\r\nr deeds. What we suggest is\nto think simple and honest. In world, you get b=\r\nack what you give.* So give\ncompassion and humanity and get back prosperity=\r\n, health and happiness.* Be\nhuman, love humans. Say no to meat!\n\n\nwith best=\r\n wishes\n\nVashi\nTeam Agniveer\nhttp://agniveer.com/\nhttps://www.facebook.com/=\r\nagniveeragni\nhttps://twitter.com/agniveer\n\r\n--e89a8f6436fcb1347604d7266e80\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;h1 class=3D&quot;entry-title&quot;&gt;Why I don=92t eat meat?&lt;/h1&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;tex=\r\nt-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Article on Agnive=\r\ner that made hundreds stop eating meat within 24 hours!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://agniveer.com/why-i-dont-eat-meat/&quot;&gt;http://agniveer.com/why-i-don=\r\nt-eat-meat/&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;=\r\n/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;a =\r\nhref=3D&quot;http://i2.wp.com/agniveer.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/02/notomeat.j=\r\npg&quot;&gt;&lt;img class=3D&quot;alignnone size-medium wp-image-10211&quot; alt=3D&quot;Why I do not=\r\n eat meat - Agniveer&quot; src=3D&quot;http://i2.wp.com/agniveer.com/wp-content/uploa=\r\nds/2013/02/notomeat.jpg?resize=3D300%2C300&quot; height=3D&quot;300&quot; width=3D&quot;300&quot;&gt;&lt;/=\r\na&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;stron=\r\ng&gt;Most polluting industry&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because meat and livestock=\r\n is one of the &lt;b&gt;most polluting industries of the world&lt;/b&gt;.\n Whatever eco=\r\nlogical damage we face today can be attributed \nsignificantly to this non-e=\r\nssential industry. (refer United Nations \ndocument on meat industry being c=\r\nulprit for climate change, land \npollution, water depletion and loss of bio=\r\ndiversity at=A0&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.htm=\r\n&quot;&gt;http://www.fao.org/docrep/010/a0701e/a0701e00.htm&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cause of hunger and pover=\r\nty&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because &lt;b&gt;meat is cause of hunger and poverty in=\r\n the world.&lt;/b&gt; Just\n as I myself hate being hungry and under-nutritioned, =\r\nI feel the same \nfor millions of my brothers and sisters born from same mot=\r\nher earth. If I\n could have killed myself to satisfy their hunger, I would =\r\nhave gladly \ndone so.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But for all I know, if people stop eating meat=\r\n and adopt vegetarian ways, &lt;b&gt;they could feed at least 10 times more peopl=\r\ne using the same efforts and energy.&lt;/b&gt;\n This is based on the principle of=\r\n energy-pyramid which states that the \nat least 10 units of vegetation is c=\r\nonsumed to prepare 1 unit of meat by\n feeding the meat-producing animals. R=\r\nefer any text on food chain or \nenergy pyramid. In fact for most of the com=\r\nmercially produced meat that \nhumans eat currently, energy losses are much =\r\nhigher.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thus each person who stops eating meat is feeding at least 9=\r\n more people apart from himself. &lt;b&gt;What could be a greater form of charity=\r\n than simply avoiding meat! &lt;/b&gt;And\n what could be a greater sin for me tha=\r\nn forcing at least 9 people to \ndie from hunger because I love the taste of=\r\n mutton!=A0Moreover, meat \nindustry also significantly depletes water.&lt;/p&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;p&gt;Since I consider entire humanity as my own family, I cannot sleep \npeace=\r\nfully with the guilt of being a cause of hunger and thirst for my \ndearest =\r\nbrothers and sisters and innocent children in my global home.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Vegetarian alternati=\r\nves exist&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because in today=92s era, I don=92t see an=\r\nybody hunting to survive like \nthe lions in Africa. Meat is simply a non-es=\r\nsential addiction. &lt;b&gt;There is no meat-product for which a healthier vegeta=\r\nrian alternative does not exist.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;text-=\r\ndecoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Meat is non-renewable&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=\r\nBecause meat is non-renewable. An animal once killed cannot grow more\n anim=\r\nals. But a plant, even when uprooted, can grow a new plant from its\n roots,=\r\n shoots and seeds. Thus the hunger and thirst caused by \nmeat-eating is muc=\r\nh more longer term and intense than that discussed \nearlier.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;text-decoration:underline&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Life is Beautiful&lt;/st=\r\nrong&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Because I consider my life to be dearest to me. I consi=\r\nder life of my\n near and dear ones to be most precious. I see all humans co=\r\nnsidering \nlives of their near and dear ones equally precious. If I kill an=\r\ny of \nthem, &lt;b&gt;I am deemed a murderer because I snatched the most precious =\r\ngift of life.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So how can I commit the same crime on other specie=\r\ns who too have a \nface and brain like me, who also love their life so much,=\r\n who also face \nthe same fear when they approach death, who also express ha=\r\nppiness and \ngrief like me and my dear ones? Simply because I do not unders=\r\ntand their\n language or consider them less intelligent? By this logic, even=\r\n killing\n of mental-patients should also be legitimized. Killing of coma pa=\r\ntients\n should also be legitimized. Eating orphans should also be legitimiz=\r\ned.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And since they are not, even meat eating is a crime of same orde=\r\nr for me.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: Then should you not stop eating pl=\r\nants also? After all, even they have life, as proved by science.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p=\r\n&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: Research has only proved that plants also \ndemons=\r\ntrate similar processes and cellular structures that are found in \nanimals.=\r\n Science does not say that plants have a personality like \nanimals. There i=\r\ns no way to prove that plants exhibit same form of \nsorrow or joy or put ef=\r\nforts like animals. Plants don=92t reproduce in a \nmanner similar to animal=\r\ns or stop being able to reproduce more plants \nlike animals after they are =\r\nkilled. &lt;b&gt;There are significant differences\n in plants and animals, and th=\r\nat is why even science of biology clearly \ndifferentiates study of botany a=\r\nnd zoology.=A0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So I do not consider plants to have a soul that f=\r\neels =93I am this \nmango tree=94. This coupled with reasons discussed above=\r\n justify eating of\n plants, but not of animals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But even if we assum=\r\ne that plants can feel pain like animals. Still, we can live without eating=\r\n animals. &lt;b&gt;But we cannot live without eating plants.&lt;/b&gt;=A0We\n simply do =\r\nnot have a choice here. And by eating plants, at least 10 \ntimes more human=\r\ns in our family can get food to eat and water to drink \nthat by tasting a b=\r\neef-steak. Thus commonsense and basic humanity \ndemands that we show mercy =\r\non those at least whom we can allow to live \nwithout killing ourselves and =\r\ntorturing our family members. Or else, \nsame reason may be given tomorrow t=\r\no justify cannibalism as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: Even lions an=\r\nd tigers eat meat. So what is wrong if humans eat?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answe=\r\nr&lt;/strong&gt;: Lions and tigers and other carnivorous animals eat meat because=\r\n &lt;b&gt;they are designed by nature to do so.&lt;/b&gt;\n If they do not eat so, they =\r\nwould die. They are not in a position to \nthink, analyze, choose and decide=\r\n what to eat, what not to eat, whether \nto eat in a plate or in a bowl, whe=\r\nther to cook or not cook, whether to \nmix 5 varieties of meat with some top=\r\npings or eat plain and raw, whether\n to cook in Tandoor or roast. Since hum=\r\nans possess this finesse, &lt;b&gt;question of right and wrong also is relevant t=\r\no humans alone.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Now humans have a choice of food =96 animals or =\r\nplants. There is 100% \nevidence that eating of animals causes hunger, pollu=\r\ntes nature and is at\n par with eating humans. Further eating animals is opt=\r\nional. So a \nsensible person like me will not eat animals. On plants, there=\r\n is \ncontroversy. People like me believe that they are chemical reactions a=\r\nnd\n not souls with personalities. Others may differ. But in absence of \ncon=\r\nclusive proof for latter, it would be still wiser to prefer them for \nfood =\r\ninstead of animals and be less criminals in worst case.=A0Further we \ndo no=\r\nt even have a choice in this case.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Say you are forced to drink from =\r\none of the two bottles. One is \nconfirmed to contain deadly poison. And ope=\r\nning the bottle will \ndefinitely kill 10 other people. For other, there is =\r\na confusion on it \nbeing poison and no one else gets killed. What would you=\r\n choose? &lt;strong&gt;At least, I would choose the second bottle without second =\r\nthoughts.&lt;/strong&gt; Same is that case with eating plants =96 the natural, hu=\r\nmane way of eating.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: But I am an atheist. I =\r\ndo not believe in soul or God. So\n plants or animals are all similar bioche=\r\nmical reactions. Why should I \ndifferentiate?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/st=\r\nrong&gt;: If you are an atheist or agnostic, &lt;b&gt;there is all the more reason w=\r\nhy you should eat plants but not animals.&lt;/b&gt;\n Because I assume you admit t=\r\nhat you are a human. And being a human, I \nassume, you agree that hurting o=\r\nther humans is not acceptable in any \nrational society. I assume that you l=\r\nove your fellow human beings. I \nassume you consider humanity to be your ow=\r\nn family. I assume you care \nfor each and every innocent human being. And h=\r\nence, I assume you would \nwant to keep at least 9 people hungry and thirsty=\r\n while you relish on \nchicken-tikka. And you would not like our future gene=\r\nrations to be \npermanently diseased and in poverty simply because we have b=\r\neen screwing\n up the environment. I assume that you indeed love your childr=\r\nen and \nwould love to gift them with blessings than curse them with hatred.=\r\n If \nmy assumptions are correct, then an atheist must be frontrunner for =\r\n=93Say\n No to Meat=94 campaign. &lt;strong&gt;If my assumptions are wrong, then e=\r\nven eating up an atheist is equally justified.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;=\r\nb&gt;Question: Then even domestication of animals and drinking milk should be =\r\ncrime?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, these are ambiguous topics=\r\n. There can \nbe views and counter views. One can discuss and debate on thes=\r\ne. But \nregardless of that, at least this is certain that if these were to =\r\nbe \ncrime, &lt;b&gt;then killing of animals is bound to be a crime of much muchbh=\r\nigher magnitude.&lt;/b&gt;\n So at least we should avoid conducting such great cri=\r\nmes against \nnature, humanity and animals, even if we differ on these few i=\r\nssues.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;For example, we cannot justify killing of human beings on pre=\r\ntext \nthat a lesser crime called =91corporate fraud=92 is not clearly defin=\r\ned in \nlaw. For someone who raises a question that domestication of animals=\r\n and\n drinking of milk are also crimes, there is all the more reason why su=\r\nch\n a person should be torch-bearer of movement for compassion on animals \n=\r\nand promote vegetarianism.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: What will I eat i=\r\nf I am in a place where I only get \nmeat? For example, if I am stranded on =\r\nan island or am in Antarctica.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: This is =\r\na very interesting question! Tell \nme, how many times you have actually bee=\r\nn in Antarctica or have been \nstranded on an island like Robinson Crusoe? T=\r\nhis very question implies \nthat you agree that &lt;strong&gt;EXCEPT&lt;/strong&gt; when=\r\n you are stranded on an \nisland or a place where you must eat meat to survi=\r\nve, in all other \nsituations, you should not eat meat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;OK So we give=\r\n you this concession. When you become Robinson Crusoe, \neat meat if you ind=\r\need believe so. But 99.9999% of human inhabitations \nand situations don=92t=\r\n demand you to be a Robinson Crusoe! You get ample \nnon-meat food in almost=\r\n all locations where humans live as a society. \nAfter all the animals they =\r\neat also eventually have to eat plants. (All \nfood-chains do begin with pla=\r\nnts. There is no animal that converts solar\n energy into bio-energy. Only p=\r\nlants can do that.)&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: What about eggs? Eggs ar=\r\ne good for health and even government promotes eating of eggs.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;=\r\nstrong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: Government is also mired in scam charges. \nJust bec=\r\nause government promotes something does not make it rational. \nHad that bee=\r\nn the case, there would have been never a movement against \nscams and for c=\r\nhange of governance!&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Coming to eggs, have you ever been in a poultry=\r\n farm? The way these \neggs are produced by ruthlessly torturing the chicken=\r\ns can raise your \nhairs (assuming you have compassion). Further, it is one =\r\nof the most \nunhygienic locations. If you consider that humans should also =\r\nbe \nmotivated to eat shit after picking from comode and serving on a \nbeaut=\r\niful plate, then perhaps you have at least one lame reason to \ndefend egg-e=\r\nating. Because the most modern and expensive egg-farms are \nno more hygieni=\r\nc than a dirty toilet in a dirty bus-stop of Karachi.=A0&lt;i&gt;(By the way, the=\r\n most=A0hygienic=A0of the meat-farms are even more dirty.)&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also,=\r\n there is no special nutrient in eggs that is not available in \nplants in a=\r\nmple. In fact eggs don=92t even come close to be termed \nnutritious compare=\r\nd to common plant food.&lt;strong&gt; Eating pulses would be a much wiser&lt;/strong=\r\n&gt; and nature-friendly option than invite diseases and destroy environment f=\r\nor eating womb of a bird.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: If we stop eating =\r\nanimals, will not their numbers grow \nup and fill the entire earth? We must=\r\n kill animals to preserve natural \nbalance.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/stro=\r\nng&gt;: This is perhaps the &lt;b&gt;cutest cruel question&lt;/b&gt;\n I have ever heard in=\r\n my life. Cute because it seems as if an innocent \nchild who first learnt a=\r\nbout nature in his pre-school has framed the \nquestion. Cruel because one i=\r\ns attempting to project himself as \nRobinhood who kills to save the planet!=\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But let=92s face the reality. &lt;b&gt;How many if us actually eat animal=\r\ns because of our genuine concern for nature?&lt;/b&gt;=A0How\n many of us are inde=\r\ned environmentalists? Or is it merely tingling of \nour taste-buds that we w=\r\nant to satisfy by hook or crook?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Coming to facts, this argument woul=\r\nd have been valid had humans as a \nrace would have been eating meat exclusi=\r\nvely through hunting like lions \nand tigers. Now lions and tigers do not cr=\r\neate farmhouses to rear deer \nand sheep so that they can have a ready suppl=\r\ny of food.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Humans on contrary have created a huge commercial industr=\r\ny to &lt;strong&gt;PRODUCE&lt;/strong&gt; meat-providing animals and then kill them to =\r\nfulfil their tastes. 99% of humans actually &lt;strong&gt;GROW&lt;/strong&gt; the anima=\r\nls they kill. And in process of this growth, they destroy the nature like a=\r\nnything.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Thus this cruel question puts the enquirer at par with Osa=\r\nma Bin Laden who justifies his terror attacks as service to humanity! &lt;em&gt;(=\r\nThis is a hard truth that most terrorists seriously believe that they are s=\r\nerving humanity and God by killing others!)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;By the way, humans=\r\n do not eat all the animals and birds. Humans don=92t\n eat carnivorous anim=\r\nals for example. Most humans don=92t eat crows, \nvultures, jackals or scorp=\r\nions. Why they have not filled the entire \nearth then?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Also, this li=\r\nne of thinking can be extended to allow cooking up \nterminally ill and aged=\r\n humans. After all, we all are trained since \nchildhood to cite population =\r\nas the greatest problem facing us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Someone who has studied ecology a=\r\nt even basic level will not give such unscientific arguments and invite rid=\r\nicule.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On contrary meat industry has endangered many species to exti=\r\nnction. \nSo=A0if preservation of natural balance of population be the overr=\r\niding \nselfless goal, then do not think even a second to adopt vegetarianis=\r\nm.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: To kill other animals is a natural phenom=\r\nenon. All \npowerful animals kill to eat. So what is wrong if humans also ac=\r\nt \nnaturally?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: First, as discussed earli=\r\ner, no animal ever \ngrows animals. No animal constructs poultry farms and b=\r\nutcher houses. \nThey simply follow their hunger instincts on need basis.&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Second, the most powerful animals are primarily vegetarians. Be it \nel=\r\nephant, or horse, or hippopotamus, or wild buffalo, or rhino, or \ngorilla.&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Third, animals also live nude, do not read poems, do not clean their=\r\n \nparts after shit and do not do a lot of things that humans do. They also\n=\r\n do not cook meat before eating. If meat-eating was so natural for \nhumans,=\r\n then most of us would have been relishing raw meat without using\n spoons a=\r\nnd forks.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Humans were designed to be intelligent&lt;/strong&gt;. T=\r\no be able to judge and decide what is wrong and what is right. To be compas=\r\nsionate. To be loyal. To be rational. &lt;strong&gt;Thus, if indeed humans want t=\r\no be =91natural=92, they should protect and not torture animals.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/=\r\np&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And if this logic be considered seriously, then even=A0cannibalism i=\r\ns \nalso natural if practiced by powerful humans. Of course, there remains \n=\r\nno basis for anti-corruption movement. After all it is natural for the \nmor=\r\ne powerful to trample those who are less powerful, as per the \nenquirer!&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But lets be human.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Lets accept it, this is a &lt;strong&gt;beast-mind=\r\nset&lt;/strong&gt; and not human way of thinking. Humanity is about analysis,=A0&lt;=\r\nstrong&gt;love, compassion and urge to protect the less powerful.&lt;/strong&gt; The=\r\nse traits alone make humans so special and different from animals.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;=\r\n=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: Biologically, humans are designed to eat animals. L=\r\nook \nat our teeth, our intestines. We don=92t have organs to digest cellulo=\r\nse \nlike herbivorous animals. Hence are we not designed to eat animals?&lt;/b&gt;=\r\n&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: Yet another lame excuse to justify craving=\r\ns \nof tongue. Humans are designed to be separate from both herbivores and \n=\r\ncarnivores. Unlike herbivores, humans cannot digest grass. That is why \nwe =\r\nare not grass-eaters. But unlike carnivores, we are also not designed\n to e=\r\nat raw meat. So we don=92t have huge canines like lion and tiger. \nHuman ca=\r\nnines are at best good for peeling sugarcanes &lt;em&gt;(Consult your \ndentist be=\r\nfore you attempt so though. If you have been eating too much \nof junk, then=\r\n sugarcane may peel off your teeth instead!)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;If meat was so na=\r\ntural to us, we would have naturally been eating \nuncooked meat. By chasing=\r\n, hunting, killing and eating away an animal \nusing fingernails and teeth a=\r\nlone. We would not have required to tie or \nimprison the animal and then ki=\r\nll it using special weapons. No animal \ndoes that.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;On contrary, frui=\r\nts and vegetables can be eaten uncooked. In fact \nmany health-regimes focus=\r\n on purely uncooked-diet. But meat demands use \nof fire. The fire is used s=\r\no that meat is converted to a more acceptable\n form. These days a raw meat =\r\nconcept is on rage in some places. But \nmedical advice is to have it cooked=\r\n to ensure there is no infection. And\n most humans find even the mention of=\r\n raw meat very disgusting. After \nall we were designed by nature to be not =\r\ncruel.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So if biology is your inspiration, be a vegetarian&lt;/s=\r\ntrong&gt;. Our brain, body, intellect and emotions were designed only to be co=\r\nmpassionate humans.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: But I live in a family a=\r\nnd society where meat is \npredominant food. How can I suddenly stop eating =\r\nmeat and appear crazy \nin my group?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: Thi=\r\ns is a more honest question. It is indeed\n an issue with many genuine hones=\r\nt people who are forced to eat meat due\n to peer pressure. The way out is t=\r\no rethink the same issue from a \ndifferent perspective.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/s=\r\ntrong&gt;&lt;b&gt;ust assume for a second that you are among a group of cannibals wh=\r\no want to eat your family members. &lt;/b&gt;Would\n you enjoy feasting with them =\r\nand eating away leg of your daughter, \nfinger of your mother and intestine =\r\nof your brother with masala curry?&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;A rational human being considers =\r\nall living beings as his own family.\n But even if you consider all humans a=\r\ns your own family, still meat \neating means you are killing at least ten of=\r\n your own family members.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Thus, &lt;b&gt;if we simply start considering th=\r\ne Mother Nature as our mother indeed, problem is solved. &lt;/b&gt;Then\n we care =\r\nfor Mother Nature like we care for our own mother. Then we are \ndeeply touc=\r\nhed at hunger and poverty of our own brothers and sisters \nacross the globe=\r\n, and would not be party to anything that makes so many \ninnocents die and =\r\nsuffer due to lack of food. So instead of being \nsomeone ashamed of your ho=\r\nnesty, you become an agent of positive change.\n Instead of fearing that you=\r\n appear crazy, you feel proud that you are \nthe most sensible.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/=\r\np&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: Does it mean all meat-eaters are murderers and should be=\r\n hated?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: Technically, first part of the =\r\nquestion is \nyes. Anyone who is in anyway instrumental to death of an innoc=\r\nent is \nindeed a =A0culprit. But we disagree that they should be hated. \nMe=\r\nat-eating is a cultural issue today. Cultural issues are tackled \nthrough s=\r\nensitisation and awareness and not through Talibanization and \nhatred. Reme=\r\nmber, the entire foundation of movement against meat-eating \nlies in &lt;b&gt;com=\r\npassion and genuine concern for all living beings&lt;/b&gt;. So we should eradica=\r\nte this brutal practice through humane means.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;We do agree that law s=\r\nhould be appropriately formulated to discourage\n meat-eating and promote he=\r\nalthy environment-friendly human-friendly \nhabits like plant-eating. But no=\r\nt through any feeling of hatred towards \nanyone. We all humans are one sing=\r\nle family. We should love each other \nand encourage each other for improvem=\r\nents. So even if you eat meat, I \nstill love you as a mother loves her new-=\r\nborn calf. And that is why I \nappeal to you to say not to meat.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;=\r\n/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: What would then happen of so many meat-rearing farms an=\r\nd\n industries? Would it not cause people in these industries to become \nune=\r\nmployed?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: No, they would become even mor=\r\ne productive. \nInstead of meat, if they start producing plant food, they ca=\r\nn feed at \nleast 10 times more people with same investments. And hence this=\r\n would \nboost the economy like anything and bring prosperity to all. And fu=\r\nture \ngenerations will thank them for gifting them a less-polluted environm=\r\nent\n and a less-hungry life.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: If meat-eating =\r\nwas so unnatural, why humans started eating meat in first place?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p=\r\n&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;: Exactly the same question can be posed for \ncrime=\r\ns like murder, fraud, racism, gender-discrimination, terrorism and \nrape. A=\r\nny evil breeds on ignorance and lack of education. Even if you \nlook into B=\r\nible, it states that originally all humans were plant-eaters \n(Genesis 1.29=\r\n for example).&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Vedas =96 &lt;strong&gt;the oldest books known to humanity&lt;=\r\n/strong&gt; =96 \nvociferously suggest non-meat diet for humans. The first mant=\r\nra of \nYajurveda itself begins with an advise to protect the animals.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;=\r\np&gt;Over ages, due to lack of wisdom, lack of development, violent \nperiods e=\r\ntc, there was an incentive to focus only on immediate needs \nthan think sma=\r\nrtly. Or blindly ape old customs in name of religion or \nculture. Hence mea=\r\nt-eating became as prevalent as gender-discrimination \nor racism etc.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;=\r\np&gt;When we plan our present and future, we are not at all bothered about\n wh=\r\ny we did not do something in past. We simply rationally evaluate the \nbenef=\r\nits in present and future, and plan accordingly. That is why we use\n laptop=\r\ns, speak on mobile phones, watch TV and travel in planes and \ntrains even t=\r\nhough human=A0civilisation never had these ever before. &lt;strong&gt;What we sho=\r\nuld be bothered today is not why something happened in past.&lt;/strong&gt;\n We s=\r\nhould instead focus on what we need to do right now to save our \nlovely pla=\r\nnet and bring nourishment for teeming billions that are facing\n punishment =\r\nfor our cravings of tongue. We should focus on what we must \ndo today to no=\r\nt be a villain torturing our own lovely children tomorrow.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;=A0&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;=\r\np&gt;&lt;b&gt;Question: I thought you would argue as animal-rights activist and I\n w=\r\nould question why you are not being a plants-right activist. You \ninstead s=\r\ntarted arguing as human-rights activist. How do I counter you \nthen?&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Answer&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;1. The way Supreme Lord has designed t=\r\nhis world, if one genuinely \nstarts caring for humans alone, then care for =\r\nanimals would chip in \nautomatically. After all this is just a marvellously=\r\n symbiotic world \nwhere everything is interrelated. &lt;b&gt;You get back what yo=\r\nu give.=A0&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;2. Why do you need to counter something which is so o=\r\nbvious and intuitive? Let us admit that &lt;b&gt;meat-eating is a social-evil&lt;/b&gt;=\r\n\n that thrives from dark-ages like gender discrimination, racism etc. It \ni=\r\ns hardly a century ago that we gave voting rights to women. Racism and \ncas=\r\nteism were legally uprooted hardly a few decades ago. Still movement \nagain=\r\nst these evils continue. So we are not as evolved as technological \nadvance=\r\ns may make us believe. Let us take meat-eating as next evil to \ntackle, giv=\r\nen the appalling situation of environment and given the \npoverty statistics=\r\n of the world. &lt;b&gt;We should realise that each bite of \nmeat we relish makes=\r\n one poor die somewhere in world. And making earth \ncloser to hell for our =\r\nchildren whom we love the most.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;3. For those who indeed are rati=\r\nonal and compassionate, this is indeed also an animal-rights issues. We inh=\r\nerited this &lt;b&gt;tribal mentality somehow that the whole world is designed ex=\r\nclusively for us =96 the humans. &lt;/b&gt;This\n lust made us destroy the environ=\r\nment and start considering the entire \nearth as our personal consort. And w=\r\nithin last century, the situation \nhas turned so worse that scientists are =\r\nnow worried about what would \nhappen about our basic necessities of food, l=\r\nand and water in times to \ncome.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;In medieval times, the lust made us=\r\n to disregard women as inferior to\n men in name of even religion. Women, li=\r\nke animals, were considered by \nmany priests to have no soul. Others consid=\r\nered them to be \nhalf-intelligent than men and impure.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Many other pe=\r\nople, like =93blacks=94 were considered fit to be slave \nalone. Then in las=\r\nt few decades, the enlightened ones took a journey \nbackwards to rectify th=\r\ne blunders. We thus uprooted racism and casteism.\n We started considering w=\r\nomen as equal to men in social, intellectual \nand political rights. And now=\r\n it is time to take the journey a step \nfurther and show our concern for an=\r\nimals as well. All these concerns =96 \nhuman-rights, gender-rights, animal-=\r\nrights =96 are part of same spectrum \nand caused out of same ignorance in h=\r\numan mind. &lt;b&gt;So the evolved ones should work to take this next step.&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/=\r\np&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And even those societies that are yet to do their homework on \ngender=\r\n-rights and human-rights also could expedite their progress if \nthey holist=\r\nically incorporate animal-rights as well.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;But even if they do not, t=\r\nhe dangerous situations of today force any \nrational person to embrace anim=\r\nal-rights. As a means to fulfil demands \nof grave human-rights issues like =\r\npoverty of teeming billions and damage\n of environment guaranteeing a dange=\r\nrous future for our children.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;So do not counter the light of truth. =\r\nBe honest, be humble and be \nrational. Love others as you expect others to =\r\nlove you. The least you \ncan do to showcase your love for your own brothers=\r\n and sisters and \nchildren of future is to replace that chicken-soup with t=\r\nomato-soup.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Be human, love humans.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;S=\r\nay no to meat!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;And remember, &lt;strong&gt;you get back what you =\r\ngive.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Vedas, the oldest texts known to humans and divine wo=\r\nrd for millions categorically state that animals are to be loved, not kille=\r\nd. Hundreds of Mantras in Vedas clearly assert that only vegetarian diet is=\r\n meant for humans. The very first Mantra of Yajurveda commands all nobles t=\r\no defend animals.

It increases risk of cancer, heart disease and diabetes=\r\n. A habit \nthat takes innocent lives, promotes hunger, destroys future of c=\r\nhildren \ncannot bring positive impact in our lives. You cannot meditate pro=\r\nperly \nif you eat meat. Food has greatest impact on state of your mind, aft=\r\ner \nyour deeds. What we suggest is to think simple and honest.=A0In world, =\r\nyou\n get back what you give.&lt;strong&gt;=A0So give compassion and humanity and =\r\nget back prosperity, health and happiness.&lt;/strong&gt; Be human, love humans.=\r\n=A0Say no to meat!&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;all&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;with best wishes&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Va=\r\nshi&lt;br&gt;\nTeam Agniveer&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://agniveer.com/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;=\r\n&gt;http://agniveer.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;https://www.facebook.com/agniveerag=\r\nni&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://www.facebook.com/agniveeragni&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;a href=\r\n=3D&quot;https://twitter.com/agniveer&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;https://twitter.com/agn=\r\niveer&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\r\n--e89a8f6436fcb1347604d7266e80--\r\n\n"}}
