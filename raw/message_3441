I see t=\r\nhat your signature changed after the trip.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; We had a remarkable time=\r\n at Varanasi. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; The moment our flight landed at the Kashi airport wh=\r\nich is actually quite outside the main city of Kashi, Manish said there is =\r\nsomething in here which is different. The energy is palpable throughout. Af=\r\nter checking in at the hotel we spend the time in roaming around the ghats,=\r\n watching the evening Ganga Arati and shooting.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; By 9 PM Manish deci=\r\nded on doing a Chandi homa, at the famous Manikarnika samshan, on a funeral=\r\n pyre. Sadhana in a samshan bhoomi is something that many great sadhakas in=\r\n Hinduism have done before. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to perform various=\r\n sadhanas in a samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a great siddha -=A0spent most o=\r\nf his days near the Manikarnik Samshan doing sadhana.=A0The effect that a S=\r\namshan has on the human consciousness can be apty used, for those who have =\r\nsuch inclination, to further ones spiritual growth. The fire of a funeral p=\r\nyre is called kravyada agni, an impure form of fire unlike the fire of a st=\r\nandard homa agni. However, there have been sadhakas, and many in number, wh=\r\no has used the samshan agni to perform homas. They chose not to make a dist=\r\ninction between pure and impure.If someone feels that a funeral pyre is &quot;un=\r\nholy&quot;, he or she would be better off not trying anything in such a fire. Th=\r\ne main deities of a samshan bhoomi are Mahakala and\n&gt;  Mahakali. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; =\r\n=A0We went to buy some samagri - til (black and white), couple of=A0full co=\r\nconuts, flowers, incense stick (agabatti), =A0kismis, havan samagri. While =\r\nbuying the samagri from a shop inside a lane near the Vishwanath temple, su=\r\nddenly a small begger child came and kept asking for food. There was a swee=\r\nt shop on the other side of the lane, he pointed to the shop asking for foo=\r\nd. Manish turned around, bought some food and gave it to the child. The chi=\r\nld was eating when we turned back towards the shop from where we were buyin=\r\ng the samagri. In a moment Manish asked me to check for the child, I turned=\r\n round and found no one there. I looked in the lane and there was no child =\r\nanywhere. Just gone, vanished! I still remember the child very clearly. Man=\r\nish smiled and said, &quot; The deity of this place wanted to see whether we=A0h=\r\nad become so big sadhakas that we=A0are unable to feed a hungry child=A0. T=\r\nhat is how God comes to test people.=A0Kya pata Narayan kab, kaha aur=A0kis=\r\n\n&gt;  roop me mil jaye.&quot;\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; At 11 pm we left for Manikarnik, dressed in =\r\na combination of red and black. Walking along the ghats we reached the sams=\r\nhan at around eleven thirty. It was quite crowded, with=A0domes (people who=\r\n work there to help the bodies burn) and the relatives. There were at least=\r\n 8 to 10 pyres burning simultaneously. Right next to it was the Ganges, pit=\r\nch black at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting for the crowd to ease out a =\r\nbit, not sure when that will happen, not sure=A0how people are going to rea=\r\nct. As we sat observing, the people too were observing us with a mix of cur=\r\niosity=A0and possible=A0apprehension.=A0Suddenly Manish closed his eyes and=\r\n meditated some time, then remarked that this place has a tremendous energy=\r\n. Something of almost infinite abilities resides in this samshan bhoomi. A =\r\ndeity. While sayingf so he turned behind to look at something, I too turned=\r\n. I could see nothing but blank space. But that very instant the dogs in th=\r\ne samshan went running=A0to\n&gt;  that direction.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; After waiting like t=\r\nhis for about an hour, we found a pyre where the relatives had left.The maj=\r\nor portion had been burnt already, but there was enough left to last for so=\r\nme time still. We went and sat next to it. Manish started the homa. The off=\r\nering was of til. I sat next to him doing the Chandi path, trying to be in =\r\nsync with his recital. A part of my mind was also trying to adjust itself t=\r\no the ambience. There were quite a few people around watching what we were =\r\nupto. But no one disturbed. The dome had to come and take wood from the pyr=\r\ne to light other pyres. He did it in the most cautious manner possible, tak=\r\ning pieces from the fringe of the pyre. After some time Manish indicated to=\r\n him not to take any more wood. The dome nodded his head and did not distur=\r\nb that pyre again. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Very soon, within half an hour I noticed that a=\r\n pack of 4/5 dogs had come and were sitting around the pyre on which the ho=\r\nma was being done. As=A0I=A0read the Chandi I felt a great pressure on my h=\r\nead, from all sides. As if a something was pressing hard on my skull, gripp=\r\ning it tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon forgot who was wat=\r\nching us or anything else around me, except for the sound of the Chandi Pat=\r\nh. Very nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it was a piece o=\r\nf iron and there=A0was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just kept pulling the =\r\nmind away to some distant place, far, far away from the reality I am normal=\r\nly=A0accustomed to.=A0While the homa was on, suddenly=A0one black dog from =\r\nthe pack which was sitting nearby, sat up on two legs and kept starting at =\r\nManish. For I think about 10 mins it kept staring with it&#39;s head pointed in=\r\n an angular fashion. Its eyes and mannerism gave a feeling as if it is not =\r\nan animal but a human being\n&gt;  watching. Just staring and observing every a=\r\nction. Manish said Kala Bhairava had entered into the body of that dog.\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; The homa finished at around 3 AM. The meditations both at the end as =\r\nwell as in between, were all excellent. The mind would just get pulled a fe=\r\nw notches above the ordinary with slightest bit of effort.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Simply b=\r\neing in a samshan and observing the human body burning up has a powerful ef=\r\nfect on the mind. In a nearby pyre we saw the femur bones of a female human=\r\n body burning. Both the femurs were visible and spread apart. In an ordinar=\r\ny setting, this kind of a scene would mean a woman with &quot;legs spread apart&quot;=\r\n which has a very sexual connotation. In Manikarnik, on that night, it only=\r\n evoked a feeling of how eventually the body is merely a covering for somet=\r\nhing far more real and powerful that resides inside. The skin, flesh, bones=\r\n etc will perish as they are ment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.\n&gt; =\r\n=A0\n&gt; Manish said if your intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely=\r\n to please God through sadhanas=A0- i.e you are not planning something nega=\r\ntive nor desirous of petty mundane gains - there is very little chance that=\r\n you will ever come to harm. Further, when you do a Chandi homa, no etherea=\r\nl beings will disturb you because no one wants to mess with=A0someone who i=\r\ns worshipping Chandi. It is not difficult, neither something to be unnecess=\r\narily scared of. There are spirits etc for sure, but neither will you bothe=\r\nr them nor will they bother you. =A0Surrendering to the deity is very good=\r\n=A0attitude to have. And finally, the soul of the individual on whose pyre =\r\nthe homa is being done, is taken by the Goddess and acquires a lot of punya=\r\n.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Thus ended my first experience of a Chandi homa on a burning pyre=\r\n.That night was Krishna Saptami. The next two nights again we did homas at =\r\nManikarnik. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =A0Rajarshi\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; ...to be continued...\n&gt;=\r\n =A0\n&gt; Rama Naama Satya Hai..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       The INTERNET now has a personal=\r\nity.
