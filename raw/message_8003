Your point of discussion about Ashwini Kumaras and Haya Shira stories i=\r\ns prior to this incident.=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Basic rule of Medical science says tha=\r\nt one body cannot accept the parts of another one.

So you can see in http://ww=\r\nw.noblood.org/medical-conditions-treatments/6478-open-heart-surgery-without=\r\n-blood-can-done-routinely\n&gt; \n&gt; Every day this modern science gives new stat=\r\nements.

Then why they used the concept of &quot;Daana&quot; in the name of blood d=\r\nonation and advertised it as a work that gives Punya! \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Only in cert=\r\nain processes like in reproduction, there will be mixture of 2 different ma=\r\nterials, but body nourishes it as a separate wing and reproduces offspring.=\r\n Eye donation is another corruption. Cornea which is the outer lens of the =\r\nEye can only be made fit to a person having Cornea damage. That too the siz=\r\nes should match. Its not true that all the eyes which has been donated has =\r\nbeen used and a blind got the sight. There are very rare cases who get blin=\r\ndness due to Cornea damage. Just make a trip around Blind schools & eye ban=\r\nks to understand the actual statistics of blind getting vision!! Cornea tra=\r\nnsplantation is just like fixing eye lens that we use nowadays. But in the =\r\nfuture there may be syntho-organic material that replaces human donated cor=\r\nnea. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Remember that any of your organ is not useful if it is given =\r\nto others. Either it will be thrown out after some time by storing banks or=\r\n its rejected by body after some time.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Its foreign missionaries who=\r\n familiarized this kind of transfusions.=C2=A0 Their science is just a baby=\r\n stepping now. But our seers had much better vision behind every word & inv=\r\nentions.=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Animals also die, decay & perish. Its soul goes accordi=\r\nng to its karma. But we are men, not pashu. My suggestion is for the people=\r\n who believe and practice Sanatana Bhatiya Dharma and its rituals. Why body=\r\n is made into ashes including a detailed proceducre of Shava Samskara with =\r\nmedicinal plants, fire and mantras? Why uttara shodasha karma is done such =\r\nthat the worldly desires of atma is seperated, soul is given a divya sharir=\r\na, sent to pitru lokha and only the daivika part of atma is kept for the we=\r\nlfare of the family and worshipped every yver in terms of Shradda Prakriya?=\r\n In each and every part of these rituals there will be a separation of bodi=\r\nly elements and -ve energies attached to soul such that it shouldn&#39;t contac=\r\nt the living humans or other creatures. Till what level we do this? We wont=\r\n leave ash also. It will be made floated it some of Punya Teertas like Gang=\r\na, Yamuna, Godavari etc., There is in depth Genetic level explanation hidde=\r\nn in all\n&gt;  these practices.\n&gt;\n\n\n \r\n---1062763926-911361130-1331225112=:52217\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;A &lt;b&gt;cataract&lt;/b=\r\n&gt; is a clouding that develops in the &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wik=\r\ni/Lens_%28anatomy%29&quot; title=3D&quot;Lens (anatomy)&quot;&gt;crystalline lens&lt;/a&gt; of the =\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye&quot; title=3D&quot;Eye&quot;&gt;eye&lt;/a&gt; or in it=\r\ns envelope (&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capsule_of_lens&quot; title=\r\n=3D&quot;Capsule of lens&quot;&gt;lens capsule&lt;/a&gt;), varying in degree from slight to co=\r\nmplete &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opacity_%28optics%29&quot; title=\r\n=3D&quot;Opacity (optics)&quot;&gt;opacity&lt;/a&gt; and obstructing the passage of light.This=\r\n is common nowadays.

Eye donation is anoth=\r\ner corruption. Cornea which is the outer lens of the Eye can only be made f=\r\nit to a person having Cornea damage. That too the sizes should match. Its n=\r\not true that all the eyes which has been donated has been used and a blind =\r\ngot the sight. There are very rare cases who get blindness due to Cornea da=\r\nmage. Just make a trip around Blind schools &amp; eye banks to understand t=\r\nhe actual statistics of blind getting vision!! Cornea transplantation is ju=\r\nst like fixing eye lens that we use nowadays. But in the future there may b=\r\ne syntho-organic material that replaces human donated cornea. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Remember that any of your organ is not useful if it is giv=\r\nen to others. Either it will be thrown out after some time by storing banks=\r\n or its rejected by body after some time.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Its =\r\nforeign missionaries who familiarized this kind of transfusions.&nbsp; Thei=\r\nr science is just a baby stepping now. But our seers had much better vision=\r\n behind every word &amp; inventions.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Animals also =\r\ndie, decay &amp; perish. Its soul goes according to its karma. But we are m=\r\nen, not pashu. My suggestion is for the people who believe and practice San=\r\natana Bhatiya Dharma and its rituals. Why body is made into ashes including=\r\n a detailed proceducre of Shava Samskara with medicinal plants, fire and ma=\r\nntras? Why uttara shodasha karma is done such that the worldly desires of a=\r\ntma is seperated, soul is given a divya sharira, sent to pitru lokha and on=\r\nly the daivika part of atma is kept for the welfare of the family and worsh=\r\nipped every yver in terms of Shradda Prakriya? In each and every part of th=\r\nese rituals there will be a separation of bodily elements and -ve energies =\r\nattached to soul such that it shouldn&#39;t contact the living humans or other =\r\ncreatures. Till what level we do this? We wont leave ash also. It will be m=\r\nade floated it some of Punya Teertas like Ganga, Yamuna, Godavari etc., The=\r\nre is in depth Genetic level explanation hidden in\n all&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  these pra=\r\nctices.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;me=\r\nta http-equiv=3D&quot;x-dns-prefetch-control&quot; content=3D&quot;on&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---1062763926-911361130-1331225112=:52217--\r\n\n"}}
