I am cc&#39;ing the reply=\r\n to some yahoogroups interested in spirituality, while ensuring your anonym=\r\nity.\n \nA lot of philosophical questions can be answered in multiple ways. T=\r\nhere is no single correct answer. The answer appropriate for one person is =\r\ninappropriate for another. If I say &quot;God is the doer of all things. When Ar=\r\njuna killed his gurus and elders, actually God did it through him&quot;, a lesse=\r\nr person may imitate it and that will be unfortunate. But that will be a ve=\r\nry appropriate point to make to a more elevated person who still has a sens=\r\ne of ownership over his actions and need to give it up.\n \nThus, one cannot =\r\nanswer questions such as yours without understanding the current spiritual =\r\nlevel of the asking person. Otherwise the answer will be utterly useless. I=\r\n will go by my gut and answer the way I think will be useful to you and som=\r\ne others on the vedic-wisdom yahoogroup.\n \n*        *        *\n \n1. God cre=\r\nated human beings and other beings so that there is some commotion in the A=\r\ntman (cosmic soul). If there is no different beings with different qualitie=\r\ns, the whole universe will be filled with Atman (cosmic soul). That too hap=\r\npens for a while. But, at other times, various beings with various qualitie=\r\ns are created. An ocean may be still for a while and give rise to a lot of =\r\nwaves for a while. If cosmic soul is like an ocean, various beings are like=\r\n waves in the ocean.\n \n2. God decides based on the cumulative good/bad of a=\r\nll your previous actions and wishes over all your lives so far. If you have=\r\n good tendencies, it is because of good actions and wishes in the past. If =\r\nyou have bad tendencies, it is because of bad actions and wishes in the pas=\r\nt. All you can do is to engage in good actions and have good wishes. That w=\r\nill keep you in good stead in future.\n \n3. Your own free will!!!! That is w=\r\nhy now you have to pay for it. Nature works on the principle of &quot;equal reac=\r\ntion to every action&quot;. You engaged in an action using your own free will an=\r\nd nature has to somehow find a way to give the equal reaction to that actio=\r\nn. God is there to implement the rules of nature.\n \nThe circumstances faced=\r\n by you are decides by nature based on the previous actions exerted by your=\r\n free will. Within the limitations imposed by those circumstances, your fre=\r\ne will decides one particular action among several possible actions. That g=\r\nets added to the list of your actions and nature pays back for it in future=\r\n by creating different circumstances for you to operate under.\n \n4. There i=\r\ns a duality and singularity. In the world of singularity, there is one god =\r\n- the cosmic being. Gods and demons, good and bad, auspiciousness and inaus=\r\npiciousness, intelligence and foolishness, happiness and sadness, knowledge=\r\n and ignorance, punya and sin - all are nothing but this singular god. Ther=\r\ne is nothing but that singular god. That singular god lives in all of us, i=\r\nn each molecule, atom and sub-atomic particle of this universe. The entire =\r\ncore of our being is filled with this singular god.\n \nWhen the same world i=\r\ns seen through the lense of duality, this singular god manifests as differe=\r\nnt entities. In the world of duality, there are various gods engaged in var=\r\nious good roles and various demons engaged in various bad roles. There is a=\r\nlways a tussle between them.\n \nNow again, all these gods and demons engaged=\r\n in various good and bad roles exist within us in a microcosmic form. The B=\r\nrihaspati (teacher of gods) within us (i.e. our intelligence and discretion=\r\n) tells the gods within us (various good qualities) what to do and works fo=\r\nr their victory. Various gods and demons discharge their roles. But the res=\r\nult varies.\n \nIf a person&#39;s spiritual evolution is like that of the world w=\r\nhen Ravana was ruling earth, then the demons inside the person will be domi=\r\nnating over the gods and gods go into hiding within that person. He will en=\r\ngage in sins. If a person&#39;s spiritual evolution is like that of the world w=\r\nhen Rama killed Ravana and ruled earth in peace and prosperity, then the go=\r\nds inside that person will be dominating over the demons. Ge will engage in=\r\n good deeds. And so on.\n \nSo, realize that there are gods and demons inside=\r\n us and there is a constant tussle between them. The good thing is that god=\r\ns are amara, i.e. immortal. They can be weak and defeated, but they never c=\r\nompletely die. Demons can die, gods can never die. They may be defeated, bu=\r\nt they live on and overcome demons oneday!\n \nIf someone tells you &quot;there is=\r\n only one god and he is in all of us&quot;, realize that this refers to the sing=\r\nular god I described earlier. With that god, there is no distinction betwee=\r\nn good and bad. The distinction comes with gods of duality. The moment you =\r\ntalk of duality, gods and demons are both there and there is a tussle.\n \n5.=\r\n God is simply doing his job. Nature is based on the rule of equal reaction=\r\n to one&#39;s actions and God impassionately implements that rule. If one was r=\r\neally cruel to somebody else and killed cruelly, nature will have to find a=\r\n way to give an equal reaction. It is sad, but that is how nature works!\n \n=\r\n6. The previous karmas and rinas to various people decide the give and take=\r\n in this life. The relations in this life may be relations in the past life=\r\n too (but the exact relationship may be different). If you harassed a parti=\r\ncular person in the last life, nature may provide an opportunity for that p=\r\nerson to harass you now.\n \nAgain, if nature is placing you in a difficult c=\r\nircumstance where someone is harassing you and making life difficult, it is=\r\n not because nature hates you or god hates you. It is because you did exact=\r\nly the same thing to someone else previously. Nature is paying back.\n \nThe =\r\ngoal of this &quot;pay back game&quot; of nature is that after a big cycle of actions=\r\n and equal reactions, one understands how nature works and manages to leave=\r\n the game! When all the players leave the game, the game will end. Until th=\r\nen, the game will go on...\n \n7. As more and more people engage in more and =\r\nmore sinful behavior, this creates of a spiral of adharma. That increases t=\r\nhe negative quality of time in general and leads to more and more people en=\r\ngaging in adharma. It is a spiral.\n \nUnfortunately, we are in Kali yuga and=\r\n adharma will only increase in the long run. But, by engaging in good actio=\r\nns of great magnitude, we can create positive energy and slow down this spi=\r\nral of adharma.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIt is good that you worry about tho=\r\nse who suffer. That compassion is great. But that compassion alone is not s=\r\nufficient. Instead, if you and others engage in good actions and create a p=\r\nositive energy of great magnitude in the world, that can be helpful. If ten=\r\n thousand people are performing a homam every morning, trying to transform =\r\ntheir attitude to that of surrender to god and limited ego, that can really=\r\n transform the world atleast for a few decades and centuries.\n \nDo homam, d=\r\no meditation, read good books, have good company, discuss spiritual matters=\r\n (instead of wasting time on meaningless entertainment), think of god, try =\r\nto understand the ways of god, lessen pride and ego, try to do your best in=\r\n each action without much attachment, analyze each of your own actions and =\r\ncorrect the internal attitude. If you keep up like this and several others =\r\ndo, the problems you mentioned can see some relief.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasim=\r\nha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a =\r\nShort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpana=\r\ns Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://gro=\r\nups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicas=\r\ntro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------- \n\n  Dear =\r\nsir,\n\n  This is &lt;deleted&gt; from &lt;deleted&gt;. I came to know about you from my =\r\nhusband &lt;deleted&gt;.\n  He has told about you a lot and i have read your mails=\r\n ..ganapathi homam, \n  vedic explanations etc.,\n\n  I wish you will help me =\r\nto have clear ideas about some of my basic questions.\n  Always I ask some q=\r\nuestions to myself.Even myself and my husband will discuss\n  regarding this=\r\n. But we both unable to find out the answer. They are,\n\n  1. My first quest=\r\nion is why God created human beings?\n\n  2. When God is creating all the hum=\r\nan beings,we are all God&#39;s children.\n  Then why he is differntiating some p=\r\neople are good, some are bad? On what basis he\n  is deciding that &quot;this per=\r\nson will have good habits in his life time and that person will have\n  all =\r\nbad habits? &quot;\n\n  3.Some of the astrologers say to me, whatever problems/suf=\r\nferings etc., we are facing in\n  this life time is due to our previous karm=\r\na.ie.,we have done some sin to others in our \n  previous birth.Who induced =\r\nus to do sin in our previous birth to others?\n\n  4. Some people say, God is=\r\n inside us. When God is inside us, why people are doing sin to \n  others? I=\r\nf they are doing, why God is not correcting them??\n\n  5.Nowadays, they are =\r\nso many accidents happening in the city. Painful deaths are\n  happening whi=\r\nch cannot be digested / make us sleepless for nights together. Why God \n  i=\r\ns giving these type of painful death to people? why he is so cruel?People s=\r\nay the person \n  who died might have made sin to others in last birth. For =\r\nthat, this kind of cruelty is required?\n  Why God is not giving peaceful de=\r\nath??\n\n  6. My another question is regarding family issues. Most of the dau=\r\nghter-in-law suffer becos\n  of her Mother-in-law/Father-in-law/Sister-in-la=\r\nw and Husbands or vice versa. I have come across\n  so many families like th=\r\nis.If daughter in law is tortured from her husband&#39;s family, is it due\n  to=\r\n her horoscope or due to society. If it is due to her horoscope, its the sa=\r\nme answer that \n  its her karma. Why her karma is written like that? why sh=\r\ne should suffer in her life?? Who has\n  made her to suffer like this(even i=\r\nf she is of good character/good habits)??\n\n  7. Nowadays, it is becoming ve=\r\nry unsafe for ladies in the society. Some girls are getting \n  exploited an=\r\nd some knowingly going in the wrong way making a mind set that nothing is \n=\r\n  wrong. Why society has developed like this??When God has created the worl=\r\nd, why he is \n  allowing it to go worse? What will be the future of the you=\r\nngsters? whether we can bring \n  up our children with good habits? I feel i=\r\nts very difficult..All these things related to astrology?\n\n  Kindly bear wi=\r\nth my long mail and guide me.\n\n  Thanks/Regards,\n  &lt;deleted&gt;\r\n------=_NextPart_000_03DB_01C92C00.FFD26350\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;utf-8&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n=EF=BB=BF&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HT=\r\nML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Du=\r\ntf-8&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;DIV {\n\tMARGIN: 0px\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;META content=\r\n=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3395&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste Madam,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I=\r\nt took a while to get to your mail. &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT \nface=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I a=\r\nm cc&#39;ing the reply to some yahoogroups interested in \nspirituality, while e=\r\nnsuring your anonymity.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;A lot of philosophical ques=\r\ntions can be answered in \nmultiple ways.

It is sad, but that is how \nnature works!&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl size=3D2&gt;6.

My first question is why God created human beings?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT f=\r\nace=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;2. When God is creating all=\r\n the human beings,we are all God&#39;s \n  children.&lt;BR&gt;Then why he is differnti=\r\nating some people are good, some are bad? \n  On what basis he&lt;BR&gt;is decidin=\r\ng that &quot;this person will have good habits in his \n  life time and that pers=\r\non will have&lt;BR&gt;all bad habits? &quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;3.Some of the astrologers say to me, whatever pr=\r\noblems/sufferings etc., \n  we are facing in&lt;BR&gt;this life time is due to our=\r\n previous karma.ie.,we have \n  done some sin to others in our &lt;BR&gt;previous =\r\nbirth.Who induced us to do sin in \n  our previous birth to others?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  =\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;4. Some people =\r\nsay, God is inside us. When God is inside us, why people \n  are doing sin t=\r\no &lt;BR&gt;others? If they are doing, why God is not correcting \n  them??&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;5.Nowadays, t=\r\nhey are so many accidents happening in the city. Painful \n  deaths are&lt;BR&gt;h=\r\nappening which cannot be digested / make us sleepless for \n  nights togethe=\r\nr. Why God &lt;BR&gt;is giving these type of painful death to people? \n  why he i=\r\ns so cruel?People say the person &lt;BR&gt;who died might have made sin to \n  oth=\r\ners in last birth. For that, this kind of cruelty is required?&lt;BR&gt;Why God \n=\r\n  is not giving peaceful death??&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;=\r\n/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;6. My another question is regarding family issues=\r\n. Most of the \n  daughter-in-law suffer becos&lt;BR&gt;of her \n  Mother-in-law/Fa=\r\nther-in-law/Sister-in-law and Husbands or vice versa. I have \n  come across=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;so many families like this.If daughter in law is tortured from \n  her h=\r\nusband&#39;s family, is it due&lt;BR&gt;to her horoscope or due to society. If it \n  =\r\nis due to her horoscope, its the same answer that &lt;BR&gt;its her karma. Why he=\r\nr \n  karma is written like that? why she should suffer in her life?? Who \n =\r\n has&lt;BR&gt;made her to suffer like this(even if she is of good character/good =\r\n\n  habits)??&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n =\r\n &lt;DIV&gt;7. Nowadays, it is becoming very unsafe for ladies in the society. So=\r\nme \n  girls are getting &lt;BR&gt;exploited and some knowingly going in the wrong=\r\n way \n  making a mind set that nothing is &lt;BR&gt;wrong. Why society has develo=\r\nped like \n  this??When God has created the world, why he is &lt;BR&gt;allowing it=\r\n to go worse? \n  What will be the future of the youngsters? whether we can =\r\nbring &lt;BR&gt;up our \n  children with good habits? I feel its very difficult..A=\r\nll these things related \n  to astrology?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial si=\r\nze=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT \n  face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Kindly bear with \n  my l=\r\nong mail and guide me.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  &lt;DIV&gt;Thanks/Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;=\r\n&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_03DB_01C92C00.FFD26350--\r\n\n"}}
