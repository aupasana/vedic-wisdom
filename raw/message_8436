It is weird to see how the body loses all=\r\n importance the moment it dies. It is also strange how a dead body looks ju=\r\nst like an empty house...exactly like someone just left. It certainly makes=\r\n one think that there must be something more to us than this fleshy cage. T=\r\nhis cage that becomes unattractive in old age, filled with appalling miseri=\r\nes in serious illness, and hideous in death. \n\nIt is interesting to think a=\r\nbout what one can do to help the sick and dying, when they reach a stage be=\r\nyond all human aid. It is not pleasant to watch someone die while feeling u=\r\ntterly helpless to relieve suffering. \n\nSivananda used to have great faith =\r\nin the Name- he used to call it &quot;Divine Namapathy&quot;. While modern medicine, =\r\nAyurveda, Reiki etc all have their place, he used to say that, Namapathy wa=\r\ns an outstanding way to prevent disease and heal us on all levels- physical=\r\n, mental and spiritual. \n\nWhile he said all names of God- Rama, Allah, Budd=\r\nha, Jehovah- are equal, he often mentioned the Mahamrityunjaya mantra speci=\r\nally for healing purposes. And especially for those who are very sick or dy=\r\ning.\n\nHe says &quot;Maha Mrityunjaya Mantra will remove accidents, incurable dis=\r\neases and bestow long life and immortality. It is a Moksha Mantra too.&quot;\n\nI =\r\nvisited the Sivananda Charitable hospital in Pattamadai, Tamil Nadu some ye=\r\nars ago, and the doctors and nurses who work there, start the day with chan=\r\nting of mantras (including the Mahamrityunjaya) for their patients, each ot=\r\nher and the whole world. I believe it is the same with the little Ashram ho=\r\nspital in Rishikesh. What a wonderful way to start the day.....repeating ma=\r\nntras with your colleagues. \n\nI wanted to mention the power of this mantra =\r\nfor anyone who knows people who are sick/seriously ill (or indeed, if you y=\r\nourself are unfortunately unwell). It is simply to invoke the blessing of G=\r\nod to ease suffering, or to help bear suffering better. Basically saying &quot;T=\r\nhy Will be done&quot; because You know what is best. Of course it is NOT asking =\r\nfor a miracle cure (unless that happens to be the Will of God). \n\nAt any po=\r\nint in time, there are several human beings, animals and various creatures =\r\nwho are dying, and unfortunately suffering greatly during the process of dy=\r\ning. I think it would be nice to repeat this mantra a few times daily to re=\r\nduce their misery. Our sages say it works, and I believe them. \n\nHere is a =\r\nlink for those who are interested in learning more about this great mantra.=\r\n The article is written by a disciple of Swami Satyananda, a saint of very =\r\nrecent times. \n\nhttp://www.yogamag.net/archives/2007/ajan07/mrit.shtml\n\nBes=\r\nt wishes,\n\nAparna\n\n=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\n|| Om =\r\nShaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\nYahoo!
