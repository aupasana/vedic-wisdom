The word energy or shakti may sound heavy and may have all kinds of connotations in the minds of people. Shakti is simply a force that can be used to change or move something karmically.\n \nSuppose you see something or someone beautiful and the enemy of &quot;desire&quot; (one of shadripus - six internal enemies) tries to attack your mind. Or suppose someone abuses you and the enemy of &quot;anger&quot; tries to attack your mind. How does your mind fight back?\n \nJust as you need energy to fight external enemies, your mind needs energy to fight internal enemies. If your mind has no shakti, the enemies take over and take mind in a direction. If you mind has and exerts shakti, the enemies are stopped (fully or partially) and the their push on the mind is negated.\n \nWhen you eat, you get physical energy. When you exercise, that physical energy is stored in the right places of the body. Similarly, when your mind spends time in a state of focused calmness, it eats from the universal source of shakti and gets nourished. When it spends time in patterns of regulated exercises (e.g. homam, japam, bhajan, satsang etc), it stores that shakti in the right places in the mind.\n \nJust as physical energy helps you fight external enemies who attack you, this spiritual energy helps you fight internal enemies who attack you.\n \nIf your surrender is perfect and you are going through the good and bad fruits of your karmas without committing new karmas, your point is right. You are like a weightless leaf and you need no energy - you go with the flow. But, if you still have a conditioned mind that is vulnerable to attacks from shadripus and vulnerable to committing NEW karmas, don&#39;t you think some energy is needed?\n \nDon&#39;t look at spiritual shakti as something that enables you to do great deeds in the world. Though that too is possible, that is a ego-promiting attitude and inappropriate for most sadhakas. Looks at spiritual shakti as something that enables you to fight back your own internal enemies and overcome your own weaknesses.\n \n*        *        *\n \n4. If you are living every second without any goals/agendas/wishes/anticipations at all, then you are all already liberated and then your point is meaningful.\n \nBut, if you do have some some goals, some wishes, some anticipations, some agendas etc, then you should realize that those wishes and anticipations have a kinetic energy of their own (kaarmically) and they bind you further. You need the spiritual energy (shakti) accumulated through exertion of self-control to negate that kinetic energy and stop you from getting bound further.\n \nSome people make the mistake of thinking that desire of moksha is also a desire and can stop you from moksha. That is true. However, it is better than many other desires and definitely worth having. It can be jettisoned when the time comes.\n \nSuppose you have a trash can in which you collect trash. Just throw away the collected trash and hang on to the trash can. If you throw away the can too, then new trash that comes in will be all over the floor. So keep the can so that you keep collecting trash and throwing it away. You can throw away the trash can also, when you are absolutely sure that no trash is being generated.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n&gt; Date: Thu, 4 Mar 2010 11:42:03 +0000\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Brahmacharya and Sadhana\n&gt; From: Manish Pandit &lt;mm.pandit@...&gt;\n&gt; To: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; On Brahmacharya and virya:\n&gt; \n&gt; In a ml of semen, there are millions of sperm, most living beings with\n&gt; potential to form a jiva.\n&gt; Look at them under a microscope in a hospital if you get a chance some day.\n&gt; They swim really energetically, exactly like tadpoles. You would try not to\n&gt; kill tadpoles normally would&#39;nt you? or maybe, it would be ok to take God&#39;s\n&gt; name and kill them?\n&gt; \n&gt; The point is that those poor beings are destined for short life and death\n&gt; normally.\n&gt; If you realised this and stopped yourself by Brahmacharya, still you would\n&gt; have nightly emissions. Partly, rich food, partly lots of Kama related\n&gt; thoughts are responsible.\n&gt; Whenever you think of a woman/man in that way, just stop your thought by\n&gt; conscious effort and look at the thought, you will clearly see the\n&gt; copulation happening in your thought in the head.\n&gt; That is problematic, but essentially it means that sex starts in the mind\n&gt; only. Control the mind and things are generally fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; The other thing is the prostatic fluid itself, if you get a slight erection\n&gt; say after 20-30 days of strict Brahmacharya, you will notice that although\n&gt; there is no emission of sperm, some prostatic fluid comes out (this is a\n&gt; form of Shukra-Acharya.... prostatic fluid nourishes sperm and ....\n&gt; &quot;teaches&quot; it) This also represents a loss of shakti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Right, so, how to stop it??\n&gt; \n&gt; Even if you are a good sadhaka and keep Bramhacharya for a few days,\n&gt; someday you may be destined for a fall from Brahmacharya,for example, if\n&gt; some great looking heroine comes to you and drops her clothes without asking,\n&gt; how many of you will be able to resist, keeping in mind that sexual imagery\n&gt; from films may have already spoiled the mind. Most difficult....\n&gt; There are only two ways, total control, which very few can do or total\n&gt; gratification followed by terrific sadhana.\n&gt; Here is where Tantra is superb, none of these so called gurus can match a\n&gt; true sadhaka of tantra. Unfortunately, tantra has got a bad name just as\n&gt; sitting in a smashan and doing sadhana. In the former people are afraid of\n&gt; Her in the form of Maya, in the other the pasha of fear which binds normal\n&gt; humans.\n&gt; Most normal people mix up ordinary sex with a sadhana of a sexual nature.\n&gt; These are two separate things. Sadhana of this sort tricks the mind in many\n&gt; ways already discussed before.\n&gt; I would suggest that Shiva lata Mudra is superb in bringing about the kind\n&gt; of control which most people cannot imagine.\n&gt; First, you will stick to one partner for the sadhana, that is a kind of\n&gt; Brahmacharya in itself.\n&gt; Two, the sadhana when it matures, will be so good that ordinary sex will be\n&gt; thrown out of the window.\n&gt; Three, a naked woman or man can no longer arouse you in the way it did when\n&gt; you first started.\n&gt; Four, the play of the deity within your respective bodies will give you\n&gt; knowledge which normal people do not have.\n&gt; Five, even if you are born again, your partner in this sadhana and the\n&gt; deities will both come to you unasked, where can they escape? The Law of\n&gt; karma applies to everybody.\n&gt; Six, The bliss of not having to think of sex will occur for many months on\n&gt; end.\n&gt; The aashirvaad given by the sperm for not being killed (millions of such\n&gt; beings), is so tremendous that the Ojas of such a sadhaka amplifies\n&gt; tremendously. Notice that i still say sadhaka, not &quot;Great exhalted Guru&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;Bhagawan&quot; or all that rubbish.\n&gt; As far as I am concerned, very few people are qualified enough to be a Guru(\n&gt; I do not think that I am, but I guide those who come to me as my children).\n&gt; True Gurus of the sort mentioned in the AGHORA books are almost impossible\n&gt; to find, and even if you do find such a Guru, will you do everything such a\n&gt; being says? How good a disciple can most of us be?\n&gt; And the punishment for Guru Droha to such a being..... don&#39;t even ask.\n&gt; Unfortunately, sometimes for some people, even when a real sadhaka/\n&gt; Guru comes to their door, they foolishly direct that person elsewhere, such\n&gt; is the force of maya.\n&gt; \n&gt; Love\n&gt; Manish\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;pvklnrao&quot; &lt;pvklnrao@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are some unanswered questions in my mind.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The argument involving Virya is not satisfying to me:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. This explanation is explaining predominantly from a male point of view\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2. According the modern doctors, whether or not you do intentionally or\n&gt; &gt; not, the Virya does not stay. It gets secreted any way.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3. Why so much focus or affinity for accumulation of energy? Yes, the\n&gt; &gt; common argument is that we need to accumulate spiritual energy to burn our\n&gt; &gt; karma. But, why burn the karma? In several threads, the only absolute way of\n&gt; &gt; burning karma seem to be paying it up with out attachment. It is all in the\n&gt; &gt; mind. In order to realise this and condition our mind, do we really need\n&gt; &gt; energy. I trust, what we need is the resolve and persistant effort.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 4. Is not the goal is not to have a goal? We are advised not to\n&gt; &gt; anticipate/wish for an experiance while doing sadhana. Once we manage to do\n&gt; &gt; sadhana with out any anticipation, why all this focus on accumulating energy\n&gt; &gt; or even obtaining Moksha?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If the definition of Brahmacharya is to keep the mind in Brahman all the\n&gt; &gt; time, then our actions do not result in any more karma because, your mind is\n&gt; &gt; focusing on brahman and hence you do not identify yourself in your actions.\n&gt; &gt; You do them because you had to do them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Perhaps, best way to get this is not avoiding certain actions but, try\n&gt; &gt; developing ability to keep thinking about God while doing any/every thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This reminds me a story I read in my child hood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Once Narada gets to proud that he is the best devotee as he keeps\n&gt; &gt; thinking of Narayana all the time. Vishnu disappoints him by naming some\n&gt; &gt; wood cutter as his best devotee. This wood cutter utters the name of Vishnu\n&gt; &gt; only few times during the day. Narada protests and then Vishnu gives him a\n&gt; &gt; wessel full of milk and asks him to put it on his head and walk around.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If can&#39;t stop sex, try to chant God&#39;s name while you are doing sex. If\n&gt; &gt; you can manage to decrease amount of joy you derise out of sex, then you are\n&gt; &gt; on the correct path. Nigraha will come automatically if you stop enjoying\n&gt; &gt; it.\n\n\n"}}
