Siva is also reffered to as Bhakta sulabha (easy to g=\r\net for devotees) where as Vishnu is expected to test the devotee.\n\nIf we lo=\r\nok at our mythological stories, most daemons pray to Brahma or Siva and get=\r\n boons easily compared Vishnu.\n\nWhy is this?\n\n2. Animal sacrifice - does an=\r\ny of the Gods/Goddess actually want animal/human sacrifices? Even today, an=\r\nimal sacrifices are going on for local grama devatas (like Poturaju, Marida=\r\nmma, Pocamma etc.)\n\n3. Praying to multiple Gods/Goddess as opposed to prayi=\r\nng to a single God/Goddess\nRamakrishna Paramahansa once told a devotee, tha=\r\nt if he digged at one place, he would have got water as opposed to digging =\r\nin multiple places.\n\nI look at it differently (no dis-respect to the Takur)=\r\n.\n\nWhen we are digging a well, our final goal is to get water.\nHere two opt=\r\nions are there:\nDig in muliple places or dig in the same place using multip=\r\nle instruments (use spade for some time, then use a spear for some time, an=\r\nd so on so).\n\nHere praying to different Gods should be compared to digging =\r\nin different places or digging with different instruments?\n\nI felt, the fam=\r\nous argument against praying to multiple Gods is comparing it to digging in=\r\n multiple places.\n\nWhile Kali, Krishna, Ram, Bhairava all are different for=\r\nms of God, they all are the one and only Brahman and are aware of the fact.=\r\n\nIf I am praying to Krishna with single intension of merging with Krishna, =\r\nthen praying to Ram may perhaps do not help me. If I am praying to Krishna =\r\nwith sole goal of overcoming my short comings and spiritual growth. In such=\r\n a scenario, does it matter whether I pray to Krishna/Ram?\n\nI do recall the=\r\n discussion about visualising the image of the God and that we get mantra s=\r\nidhi when the thought fills out mind. How ever, not all of us are fortunate=\r\n to visualise a clear image. Most often when I try to visualise Rama/Krishn=\r\na, a famous Telugu actor who used to play those roles come to my imaginatio=\r\nn. I feel, I may be better of with out a visualisation.\n\nI use a Shiv ling =\r\nto invoke any God/Goddess along with fire.\n\nIs sticking to one God/mantra i=\r\ns really so critical?\n\n\n"}}
