What is the significance of doing Archana? Whose names/stars al=\r\nong with gotram should be given when the priest asks before Archana, for ex=\r\nample, can we give any number of names  belonging to different gotrams or o=\r\nne should stick with name/star and gotram who paid for the Archana, may be =\r\nadd family, or, is it really necessary to give name(s), or, can one give on=\r\ne&#39;s parents name, or even just the diety&#39;s name to which the archana is bei=\r\nng offered? Is it necessary to pay separately  for each gotram?\n\nBest regar=\r\nds,\nAravind\n\n\n"}}
