But tarpana is not popular in tradition with Chandi homam. I am not sure why. Tarpayaami literally means &quot;I am satisfying&quot;. Perhaps it is useful to satify Ganapathi who is in charge of the material realm (Bhuloka or Moolaadhaara chakra). Chandi is the fierce primordial energy running the universe and can one really &quot;satisfy&quot; that energy? One can only surrender to that energy and flow with it..\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- gisundar &lt;gisundar@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaskarams Narasimhaji,\n&gt; Hope you are doing good!! As guided by you and Rajarshi I started reciting the Chandi Path every day (a few chapters at first, then end to end recently) and by the blessings of the mother I am now able to complete the entire recitation within 2 hours. I am planning to start doing Chandi Homam regularly(at least once a month) starting this Sunday, mother willing. I pray to the mother and Request your well wishes along with all the other Chandi sadhakas in this group to help me in successfully complete this great task.\n&gt; \n&gt; Coming to the Chandi Homam Manual I had the following queries:-\n&gt; 1) In the poornahuti Section here, it seems to be a shortened one compared to the Ganapathi Homam. Is there any specific reason why we have left out the &quot;poornamidhah purnamidham ---purnamevavahshistye&quot; mantra ?\n&gt; Also shoudnt we add the navarna mantra and add &quot;poornahutim samarpayami&quot; like in Ganapathi Homam?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Also there is no Tarpanam mentioned in the Chandi Homam. Any reason why so?\n&gt; \n&gt; Eagerly waiting for your replies.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks and Regards,\n&gt; Girish Sundaram\n\n\n"}}
