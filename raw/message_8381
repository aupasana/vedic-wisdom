Those who know do=\r\nnt write and those who write dont know. (by the way it took a some time to =\r\nrealise that there exists full range from easy/nice/happy tantra to downrig=\r\nht black arts shamshan tantra) even the cute looking buddhist monks might f=\r\nollow the extreme. \nhttp://aghorpir.blogspot.in/2012/05/baby-magic.html\n\nan=\r\nd also it took me a while to understand that aghori beneath all the seeming=\r\nly freaky stuff carry &quot;Bleeding for longing Heart&quot; and &quot;Life is a dream - I=\r\nnterpretation&quot;. \n\nanyhow i found this blog to be a good read on tantra, its=\r\n written by a Aghori\nhttp://aghorpir.blogspot.in/\n\nHis recommended book lis=\r\nt\nhttp://aghorpir.blogspot.ca/2012/05/resources-for-traditional-hindu-tantr=\r\na.html\n\nbut guess what he has put an end to it with following words\n&quot;Some w=\r\nords of advice:  Don&#39;t allow yourself to be imprisoned by life and circumst=\r\nances by living a zombie-like monotonous 9 to 5 life like a slave!  The sys=\r\ntem is designed to keep you subservient and perpetuate itself.  Life is way=\r\n too short to waste it.  Seek for a way out!  Sorcery and Tantra is about F=\r\nreedom, especially freedom from mental shackles.  It will give you the edge=\r\n you need to get ahead in life.  Seek for freedom from the Matrix and its a=\r\nrchons.  Emancipate yourself even if it is only mentally!  You are a spark =\r\nof the Divine and are meant for greater things than this!&quot;\n\nThere are coupl=\r\ne of FB forum but they mostly dish around sadhanas for solving issues and p=\r\nrovide less theory on tantra. one guy post his tantra sadhana journey, all =\r\ni can say is that on that path fanatics only reach such high levels.\n\n\nand =\r\nif you want to read about bhairavies \n(good interpretation must otherwise u=\r\nll get lost in words)\nDiaries of a Bhairavi\nhttp://www.newrealities.com/ind=\r\nex.php/component/content/category/170-diaries-of-bhairavi?start=3D50\n\nthere=\r\n are enough clues to find her out. she is a dancer in jakarta i guess. she =\r\nteaches some basic classes also and quite accessible.\n\nin case you find any=\r\n good links do share.\n\nregards\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;sun=\r\nrise_1080&quot; &lt;sunrise_1080@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Rajarshi ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Th=\r\nank you for the very interesting information about tantra, a subject I know=\r\n very little about. \n&gt; \n&gt; It sounds fascinating. Making an idol of Durga fr=\r\nom the mud collected from the house of a widow and a prostitute! I interpre=\r\nt that ritual to demonstrate that Durga abides in the heart of a prostitute=\r\n as much as she does in the heart of a saint, and so the soil from both the=\r\nir houses is equally sacred. \n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m glad to hear you say that tantra has=\r\n so many women of high spiritual calibre...that&#39;s very inspiring. What a pi=\r\nty we don&#39;t hear much about them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I recently read a wonderful book abo=\r\nut the women saints of India, called &quot;Daughters of the Goddess&quot;, written by=\r\n an American devotee of the Goddess (Linda Johnsen). She asked the same que=\r\nstion &quot;Where are the women saints of India?&quot;. A Pandit ji replied, &quot;just be=\r\ncause they don&#39;t stand on public stages and give seminars, doesn&#39;t mean the=\r\ny don&#39;t exist!&quot;. Linda then went on a pilgrimage to India and met Ammachi (=\r\nof Kerala), Anandi Ma and other living realised saints in the female form. =\r\nI&#39;ve met Amma, but would love to meet some of the yoginis and Bhairavis you=\r\n mention.\n&gt; \n&gt; I&#39;m curious about tantra and would like to learn more about =\r\nit. I like Japa as my main spiritual practice,  but I&#39;m open to learning ab=\r\nout other paths (tantra probably includes Japa for all I know). And learnin=\r\ng more about Goddess worship would be great. I see Durga as my spiritual gu=\r\nide, keeping me on the path, doing the Sadhana with me (because I&#39;m too laz=\r\ny to do it on my own), and Hari as the goal (actually they&#39;re the same in m=\r\ny head and are both my goal as my divine parents). The cowherd girls of yor=\r\ne, clever girls, knew that the Goddess alone could give them Hari...as we a=\r\nll know, they famously worshipped Katyayani asking for Krishna, and She gav=\r\ne Him to them! \n&gt; \n&gt; Please could you reccommend some articles/books on tan=\r\ntra. I would love to have a read and educate myself on this, and may be eve=\r\nn, add something to my practice. My only worhip of Durga currently (aside f=\r\nrom abusing and praising her alternately) is repeating her mantra Om Dum Du=\r\nrgayai Namaha (or Om Shri Durgayai Namaha) randomly. (My main mantra that I=\r\n got intiated into from a Swami of the Sivananda tradition is Om Namo Naray=\r\nanaya.) And I have recently added homams to my practice, albeit only once i=\r\nn 2 weeks, and I worship both her and Hari with it (it&#39;s not a perfect homa=\r\nm technique wise, but I try and put a bit of heart in it. And if I can&#39;t fi=\r\nnd any heart, I blame Durga for not giving me any! She gets a lot of abuse =\r\nfrom me I&#39;m afraid, but as she made me, it&#39;s her own fault). \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks a=\r\ngain for the message, and here&#39;s to tantra, the path that treats women as e=\r\nquals! \n&gt; \n&gt; Aparna\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
