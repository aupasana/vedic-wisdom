The entire prathama charitra is \nenclosed with Mahakali&#39;s beeja &quot;aim&quot;. The entire madhyama charitra is \nenclosed with Mahalakshmi&#39;s beeja &quot;hreem&quot;. The entire uttara charitra is \nenclosed with Mahasaraswati&#39;s beeja &quot;kleem&quot;.\n\nIf you want to enclose any mantra with a beeja, the best way is to say &quot;om \nbeeja&quot; at the beginning and &quot;beeja om&quot; at the end. For example, you can read \nVishnu sahasra naama stotram or Lakshmi ashtottara sata naama stotram with \n&quot;om shriim&quot; at the start of &quot;shriim om&quot; at the end of each verse, for \nprosperity. You can read Narasimha&#39;s mantra with &quot;om kshroum&quot; at the \nbeginning and &quot;kshroum om&quot; at the end for removal of poisons (material and \nsubtle). You can add &quot;om kliim&quot; and &quot;kliim om&quot; (at start/end) to several \nmantras, including Gayatri mantra, to overcome desires.\n\nYou can note that each chapter in Chandipath is also enclosed with plain Om. \nYou get &quot;om RShiruvaaca&quot; at the beginning and there is an &quot;om&quot; at the end of \nthe chapter. Placing plain Om at the beginning and end of a mantra is the \nsimplest samputikarana. It is used for all the 13 chapters.\n\n*        *        *\n\nWhen you do Chandipath, it is actually fine to use the 3 beejas (aim, hreem, \nkleem) to do samputikarana of *each verse* in the respective chapters. For \nexample, first chapter will go as\n\n&quot;om aim RShiruvaaca aim om\nom aim saavaarNiH suurya tanayo yo manuH kathyate.aShTamaH\nnishaamaya tadutpattim vistaraat gadato mam aim om\nom aim mahaa maayaanubhaavena yathaa manvantaraadhipaH\nsa babhuuva mahaabhaagaH saavarNistanayo raveH aim om...&quot;\n\nLike this, add &quot;om aim&quot; at the beginning and &quot;aim om&quot; at the end of each \nverse in first chapter. For each verse in chapters 2, 3 and 4, add &quot;om \nhriim&quot; and &quot;hriim om&quot;. For each verse in other 9 chapters, add &quot;om kliim&quot; \nand &quot;kliim om&quot;.\n\n*        *        *\n\nThe beeja aim is known as sristhi beeja or creative seed. It puts life in \nmaterial and subtle things. Note that Brahma is the rishi for the first part \n(pratha charitra).\n\nThe beeja hriim is known as maayaa beeja or delusion seed. It gives mastery \nover the delusion of this universe and helps one come out of maya. Note that \nVishnu is the rishi for the middle part (madhyama charitra).\n\nThe beeja kliim is known as kaama beeja or desire seed. It helps overcome \ndesires and cleanse one. Note that Rudra is the rishi for the final part \n(uttara charitra).\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, April 02, 2009 1:14 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: a question on Chandi Paath (Durga Saptashati)\n\n\n&gt; Yes Prasad Bhai,\n&gt;\n&gt; as you mentioned, it is a samputa and there are many instances where this \n&gt; concept is used. let us see if we can get opinion of some members having \n&gt; knowledge of this.\n&gt;\n&gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vvootla&quot; &lt;vvootla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste Utpal ji,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;    This is called &#39;samputam&#39; (Lit. meaning a covered box or enclosing \n&gt;&gt; with folded palms as in anjali). The given mantra in this case is \n&gt;&gt; enclosed with praNava and respective beejakshara. Some traditions do so \n&gt;&gt; for gAyatri encasing it in praNava and vyAhrutis. I don&#39;t know the \n&gt;&gt; significance of this samputam but we do encounter it in a few different \n&gt;&gt; places (mahanyAsam for example). If there are any mantra shAstra scholars \n&gt;&gt; on the forum they&#39;ll be able to shed more details.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Regards,\n&gt;&gt; -Prasad\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; \n&gt;&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; What is a significance of -\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; * Pratham Charitra Starting with &quot;Om Aim&quot; and Ending Reversly with &quot;Aim \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Om&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; * Dwitiya Charitra Starting with &quot;Om Hreem&quot; and Ending Reversly with \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Hreem Om&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; * Trutiya Charitra Starting with &quot;Om Kleem&quot; and Ending Reversly with \n&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;Kleem Om&quot;\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; It is understood that All the Three charitras are Attributed to \n&gt;&gt; &gt; Mahaakali, MahaLakshmi and MahaSarswati respectively and hence Aim \n&gt;&gt; &gt; beeja, Hreem Beeja and Kleem Beeja are at the starting and ending of of \n&gt;&gt; &gt; each charitra.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; It is evident that All the 3 charitras are *Embedded* in Aim, Hreem and \n&gt;&gt; &gt; kleem at the same time everything (Beejakshara as well as complete \n&gt;&gt; &gt; charitra) are embedded in OM.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; What could have been the reason?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Warm Regards,\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Utpal\n\n\n"}}
