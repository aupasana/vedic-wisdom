Difference being that Sama Veda is to be sung, not chanted.\n&gt; @homam108: SamaVeda is also &quot;chanted&quot; with rigid specification on \n&gt; timing & pitch. It sounds closer 2 songs & may hv given rise 2 music. \n&gt; @I_am_Rajarshi: Your views on why Lord Krishna compares Himself to \n&gt; SamaVeda among Vedas?\n\nWhen Krishna says &quot;I am so and so among so and so&quot;, please note that &quot;I&quot; \nstands for &quot;unconditioned Self&quot;, which is the *essence* of Creation. \nAlso, do not think that X is superior to Y and Z, if Krishna says &quot;I am \nX among XYZ&quot;. It means that X is the *essence* of XYZ.\n\n*        *        *\n\nFor comparison, take a couple of other things Krishna says. He says &quot;I \nam Om among all sacred mantras&quot;. Of course, there are so many powerful \nmantras, like panchakshari, ahstakshari, dwadasakshari, navakshari, hare \nkrishna mahamantra, so many Vedic hymns, so many purana mantras, so many \nbeeja mantras etc. But, Om is the *essence* of all mantras. One with \ndifferent kinds of conditioning can use other mantras to overcome \nconditioning. But, once all conditioning is gone, one&#39;s unconditioned \nmind is established in the essence, which is represented by the mantra \nOm.\n\nSimilarly, Krishna says, &quot;I am japa among yagyas&quot;. One with a \nconditioned mind benefits from homas/yagyas performed materially with an \nexternal fire and overcomes conditioning. But, once one&#39;s conditioning \ndrops and one become very pure, one&#39;s own internal fire is strong and \njapa itself is a yagya. As one meditates with a mantra, all of one&#39;s \nthoughts and desires are sacrificed in the internal fire and one is \nestablished in the divine.\n\n*        *        *\n\nNow, regarding Vedas. The word &quot;R^ik&quot; in Rigveda is from the root &quot;R^ic&quot; \nand means &quot;to praise/extol&quot;. The word &quot;yajus&quot; in &quot;Yajurveda&quot; is from the \nroot &quot;yaj&quot; and means to sacrifice. The word &quot;sAma&quot; in Samaveda is from \nthe root &quot;sama&quot; and means &quot;same, equal, in oneness&quot;. The hymns of \nRigveda extol various aspects of Supreme Self. The hymns of Yajurveda \ndescribe how to sacrifice conditioning to realize unconditioned Self. \nThe hymns of Samaveda describe an experience of various aspects of \nSupreme Self (in oneness). That is why Samaveda is the essence of Veda \nand Krishna says &quot;I am Samaveda among Vedas&quot;, just as He said &quot;I am Om \namong mantras&quot;.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n"}}
