But what can be\nsaid =\r\nafter\n&gt; &gt; some logical thinking is that if needs to &quot;test&quot; her bhakts on so=\r\nme\nmatter, then\n&gt; &gt; obviously she does not know her bhakt becuase otherwise=\r\n there would\nbe no need\n&gt; &gt; for a test. And if she does not know her bhakt,=\r\n how can she be the\nshakti to\n&gt; &gt; rule over all?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The tests which pe=\r\nople refer to are usually the hardships that one\nhas to face\n&gt; &gt; while unde=\r\nrtaking a sadhana. When one performs a sadhana, it is only\nto achieve\n&gt; &gt; s=\r\nome goal whether that be spiritual or material objective and the\nneed for\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; sadhana is becuase the native feels that otherwise he/she may not be\nabl=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; to=C2 achive the goal easily. So essentially the purpose of a\nsadhana=\r\n is to remove\n&gt; &gt; the karmic burden towards achieving the goal. Law of karm=\r\na does not\nlet anyone\n&gt; &gt; of the hook though. The harships that you face wh=\r\nile performing a\nsadhana might\n&gt; &gt; appear like a &quot;test&quot; to a sadhaka but is=\r\n essentially the Lord\nbringing necessary\n&gt; &gt; hardships your way which creat=\r\nes the suffering in the sadhaka that\nlets the\n&gt; &gt; sadhaka shed some of the =\r\nkarma. The sadhaka will eventually be\nsuccessful but\n&gt; &gt; the effort require=\r\nd and the hardships that are yet to be faced\ndepends on the\n&gt; &gt; karmic burd=\r\nen.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the karmic burden is less, suffering is less and success is\n=\r\nobtained without\n&gt; &gt; much suffering (relatively speaking). If the karmic bu=\r\nrden is very\nheavy, you\n&gt; &gt; may suffer without seeing any success. Though y=\r\nou are now closer to\nyour goal\n&gt; &gt; after the suffering, but since the goal =\r\nis not achieved, you do not\nsee the\n&gt; &gt; results of your effort and feel the=\r\n effort was a waste.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; MA does not tests...the hardships are brought =\r\nto your way by her to\npurge you\n&gt; &gt; karmically to let you achieve what you =\r\nwant.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; This is my belief, and this I use as a basis when performing =\r\na\nsadhana. I am\n&gt; &gt; sure others may have other views though.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; Bhupendra.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nFrom: parijat_d parijat_d@\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: W=\r\ned, September 29, 2010 4:20:17 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] A query\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; i am parijat dutta from kolkata.there are some issu=\r\nes going on i\nneed to\n&gt; &gt; discuss..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; since i was 18-19,i became inte=\r\nrested in tantras.and i worship ma\nkali.bt i feel\n&gt; &gt; i had and may be have=\r\n to face several tests....like initially...i\nread books on\n&gt; &gt; tantra....wi=\r\nch promise highly materialistically beneficial\nsadhanas..\n&gt; &gt; and alarmingl=\r\ny different dieties for each purpose...i fell for\nthat...an my\n&gt; &gt; devotion=\r\n was divided...between maa kali,durga,laxmi,hanumanji..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; with time i=\r\n realized all these have no value without a gurus\nguidance.....my\n&gt; &gt; astro=\r\nloger told me....that time will be arnd 29-30 of my age.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; then again=\r\n...i was against krishna worship.....cuzz i thot\nfooshingly since he\n&gt; &gt; is=\r\n only about love(bhakti)....he may not be strong like devis..\n&gt; &gt; again sin=\r\nce...all the tridevs need shakti...so i felt shakti worship\nis the\n&gt; &gt; high=\r\nest....\n&gt; &gt; un\n&gt; &gt; also...at that time..i didnot like ramkrishna dev since =\r\nhe talked\nmostly of\n&gt; &gt; devotion...n not of powers like siddhis....\n&gt; &gt; und=\r\nestanding others thoughts n so on...as i have personally seen\nsome tantrics=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; who have this power..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; with time again i learnt bhakti is the h=\r\nighest.......i asked once a\nmaharaj who\n&gt; &gt; presides over the ashram where =\r\nmy mother was initiated ...\n&gt; &gt; which is more powerful ?? bhakti or mantras=\r\n ??....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; he said...in one word...bhakti is more powerful...without b=\r\nhakti u\nwont have the\n&gt; &gt; urge to have a mantra...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; again in a book.=\r\n...i read...the love of gopis for krishna was\nsuch.....they\n&gt; &gt; forgot ever=\r\nything of mundane world..\n&gt; &gt; they didnot want to know who krishna was.....=\r\ndint care if he was god\nor\n&gt; &gt; not......jst loving for the sake of loving..=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; bhakti only for the sake of bhakti....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; how wonderful !!!....al=\r\nl these made me realize.....how foolish i\nwas.....all i\n&gt; &gt; used to have fo=\r\nr maa was bhakti...i dint\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; know any mantra nothin (not now as well) =\r\nand i was against on the\nother hand\n&gt; &gt; .....of krishna and ramkrishnadev w=\r\nho were epitome of bhakti...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; at this time....i used to go to my mom=\r\n&#39;s gurumaatas ashram...once in\na spiritual\n&gt; &gt; discussion they said..\n&gt; &gt; g=\r\net hold of only one ......he/she is antaryami...she understands wat\nur inne=\r\nr\n&gt; &gt; needs her...like a parent\n&gt; &gt; definitely she will fulfill them......\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; at the same time....narasimha ji told in one of the\nmails........&quot;m=\r\nother knows\n&gt; &gt; the best&quot;...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; these have removed the misconceptions =\r\ni had ...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; what i want to know is when one is devoted to maa why doe=\r\ns she test\n??.....is it\n&gt; &gt; a way to bring one closer to her through realiz=\r\nations ??...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; when shes the all pervading shakti....why thers a need=\r\n for test\n&gt; &gt; ??....also...while testing does she give her child enuff\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; strength to pass the test ??\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; i am looking forward to guidance f=\r\nrom u people...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n"}}
