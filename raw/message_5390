They can be repaid in many ways. But five different debts and five specific ways to repay have been identified in scriptures:\n \n(1) Deva rina (debt to divine beings): Make offerings in fire to divine beings such as Indra, Agni, Vayu, Surya etc, while praying for the strength and happiness of those beings.\n(2) Pitri rina (debt to ancestral manes): Offer tarpanas through specific chakras (energy centers) in the palm, while praying for the freedom of ancestors from blockages.\n(3) Rishi rina (debt to seers): Study Vedas, upanishads, scriptures and wise writings and transform one&#39;s thinking and attitude.\n(4) Manushya rina (debt to other human beings): Serve others. Offer food, knowledge, services etc and serve humanity.\n(5) Bhoota rina (debt to other beings):  Feed animals, birds and other beings and take care of them with kindness.\n \nOf course, one can make offerings to rishis in fire or offer tarpanas to rishis (if you see the Tarpana manuals at the website below, you&#39;ll see sections on Deva tarpana and Rishi tarpana!). However, the best way to repay the debt to seers is to transform one&#39;s attitude through study,  contemplation and assimilation of knowledge.\n \nWe are a microcosm of the entire universe. Devas, pitris, rishis, manushyas and bhutas are within us. Devas within us are happy when undesirable conditioning within us is burnt in the fire of wisdom and we are guided by wisdom always. Pitris within us are happy when weaknesses and blockages within are flushed and mind becomes contented. Rishis (seers) within us are happy when we have a clear vision of right and wrong. The corresponding rituals and practices try to bring the required internal changes through resonance.\n \nPitri tarpana is a very simple ritual. Find the manuals at the website below. It is ideal for repaying the debts to pitris. While doing the ritual, sincerely pray that your ancestors stuck due to desires be freed from the desires, so they can move on.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Ramesh Subramanian &lt;inkarmayoga@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;  \n&gt; Appreciate a response from Sri Rao and other wise persons in this forum for this question in the message posted earlier (given below).\n&gt;  \n&gt; --- On Wed, 1/12/10, Ramesh Subramanian &lt;inkarmayoga@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Ramesh Subramanian &lt;inkarmayoga@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Methods / Rituals to neutralize Pitru Rinam\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, 1 December, 2010, 3:54 PM\n&gt;\n&gt; One has three types of Rinams towards Gods, Rishis and Piturs.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It seems the methods to neutralizing them are\n&gt;\n&gt; Prayer / Yajna / Puja,\n&gt; Adyayanam and\n&gt; Progeny\n&gt; respectively.\n&gt;  \n&gt; My questions:\n&gt;  \n&gt; 1. Are these three comprehensive (are there more?)?\n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. Are there any alternative methods to neutralize the three? If a person does not have a child or is widowed, how to neutralize the Pitru Rinam.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thanks and Regards\n&gt; Ramesh\n\n\n"}}
