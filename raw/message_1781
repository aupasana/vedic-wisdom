Intellect is disliked because it questions. And =\r\nwhen the answers are not comfortable with our existing beliefs we find excu=\r\nse to quite our mind. There are many ways to find God. Intellect never hind=\r\ners. The same way pride also has many disguise. One can be proud of humilit=\r\ny or one&#39;s devotion to god as well. \n\nSo saying such a thing actually confu=\r\nses people and set wrong beliefs in mind.\n\nRegards,\nSiya.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste fr=\r\niends,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Intellectual prowess is helpful in some matters, but it cannot=\r\n make one understand or experience god. On the contrary, it can even increa=\r\nse pride, which makes it more difficult to experience god.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Swami Vive=\r\nkananda had one of the sharpest intellects in the world in the last few cen=\r\nturies. The following is a nice quote from him. Just something to ponder..\n=\r\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---------------------------\n&gt; From http://www.ramakrishnavivekananda.=\r\ninfo/vivekananda/volume_9/conversations_and_interviews.htm (search for &quot;Edi=\r\nth Allan&quot;)\n&gt; ---------------------------\n&gt; SWAMI VIVEKANANDA: I am the disc=\r\niple of a man who could not write his own name, and I am not worthy to undo=\r\n his shoes. How often have I wished I could take my intellect and throw it =\r\ninto the Ganges!\n&gt;  \n&gt; STUDENT: But, Swami, that is the part of you I like =\r\nbest.\n&gt;  \n&gt; SWAMI VIVEKANANDA: That is because you are a fool, Madam =E2=80=\r\n&quot; like I am.\n&gt; ---------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; The thing with Vivekananda=\r\n is that he was not only a sharp thinker, but was a fearless and brutally h=\r\nonest speaker.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though intelligence can help one understand some scrip=\r\ntural teachings better and help in the sadhana in the beginning, it is not =\r\nso useful after a while. The qualities of surrender and humility are far mo=\r\nre valuable than logic and analytical thinking.\n&gt;  \n&gt; BTW, I noted that he =\r\nsaid in the same series that he has to come back once more with his Master =\r\nRamakrishna. Of course, Ramakrishna also said that he would come back after=\r\n 100 years along with everybody.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Hom=\r\nam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n=\r\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
