How wonderful was the yearning of the gopis fo=\r\nr Krishna! They were seized with divine madness at the very sight of the bl=\r\nack tamala tree. Separation from Krishna created such a fire of anguish in =\r\nRadha&#39;s heart that it dried up even the tears in her eyes! Her tears would =\r\ndisappear in steam. There were other times when nobody could notice the dep=\r\nth of her feeling. People do not notice the plunge of an elephant in a big =\r\nlake.&quot;\n\nM: &quot;Yes, sir, that is true. Chaitanya, too, experienced a similar f=\r\neeling. He mistook a forest for the sacred grove of Vrindavan, and the dark=\r\n water of the ocean for the blue Jamuna.&quot;\n\nSRI RAMAKRISHNA: &quot;Ah! If anyone =\r\nhas but a particle of such prema! What yearning! What love! Radha possessed=\r\n not only one hundred per cent of divine love, but one hundred and twenty-f=\r\nive per cent. This is what it means to be intoxicated with ecstatic love of=\r\n God. The sum and substance of the whole matter is that a man must love God=\r\n, must be restless for Him. It doesn&#39;t matter whether you believe in God wi=\r\nth form or in God without form. You may or may not believe that God incarna=\r\ntes Himself as man. But you will realize Him if you have that yearning. The=\r\nn He Himself will let you know what He is like. If you must be mad, why sho=\r\nuld you be mad for the things of the world? It you must be mad, be mad for =\r\nGod alone.&quot;\n\n\n"}}
