Rao &lt;pvr108@...&gt;\nTo: Vedic Wis=\r\ndom &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Monday, July 29, 2013 8:23 AM\nSub=\r\nject: [vedic-wisdom] Intuition, Resonance of Minds & Special Abilities\n \n\n\n=\r\n=C2=A0 \nNamaste friends,\n=C2=A0\nYou may find some people who have an unbeli=\r\nevably uncanny intuition. They may sometimes seem to &quot;read your mind&quot; and a=\r\nddress what you are thinking, without you saying anything. Some of you may =\r\neven develop such an ability in future. Even if intuition is not good in ge=\r\nneral, it may become very good with certain people or certain matters.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nI want to say a few words about such phenomena and say a few words of c=\r\naution.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nSome people are more &quot;aware&quot; in their =\r\nintuition, while some people are not so aware and simply resonate to others=\r\n&#39; thoughts without awareness.\n=C2=A0\nAs an example, someone I know does hom=\r\nam everyday and is a regular and rational person without an imaginative/int=\r\nuitive mind that gets visions, dreams etc.\n=C2=A0\nThough his sadhana was sa=\r\nattwik (even his visualization of fierce deities was in Upanishadic terms),=\r\n oneday he felt a strong urge to mix blood in rice and offer it in homam. I=\r\nt did not seem natural to him and so he did not act on that instinct though=\r\n it re-appeared in his mind several times that\n day. He ignored it as an un=\r\nnatural thought for him.\n=C2=A0\nA couple of days later, he received a mail =\r\nfrom someone close to him but living 1000s of miles away. This person happe=\r\nned to go to a smashan that weekend night for meditation and saw some Tantr=\r\niks doing a\n &quot;Rakta Chamunda&quot; homam. They were offering ingredients dipped =\r\nin their blood in homam. He just sat there and observed them. He later sent=\r\n a mail about it.\n=C2=A0\nWhen the original person received the mail, he rea=\r\nlized why he had that thought a couple of days back. His mind was simply re=\r\nsonating to the thoughts of the other person, without a complete awareness.=\r\n In fact, such a thing happened to him several times with the same person.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nThere were also many occasions when he would randomly talk about som=\r\ne topic and one specific person in the room would claim that that person wa=\r\ns thinking about exactly that topic. Again, the question in the mind of tha=\r\nt person resonated in the other mind and the person started talking about i=\r\nt.\n\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nFirst, how does this work? Simple - reson=\r\nance between minds.\n=C2=A0\nSuppose you are talking loud. You may not hear w=\r\nhat others around you are saying. Similarly, if your mind is vibrating with=\r\n too many thoughts, it may not resonate to the vibrations in other minds ar=\r\nound it.\n=C2=A0\nBut, if you are relatively calm, you can hear what others a=\r\nre saying. Similarly, if your mind is relatively calm, it may pick up vibra=\r\ntions in other minds around it (or even 1000s of miles away if there is som=\r\ne attachment/connection) and resonate to those vibrations!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nSecond, how to know where the thought is coming from?\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nWhen an infant listens to tens of voices, he simply hears different sou=\r\nnds and does not know from which face each sound is coming from. Over time,=\r\n after many observations and correlations, brain learns to discern from whi=\r\nch face each sound is coming from. Later, one may\n recognize a voice even w=\r\nhen the face is behind a curtain or otherwise invisible!\n=C2=A0\nSimilarly, =\r\nif one so wishes, one can develop the ability to discern the source of each=\r\n thought that vibrates the mind, after much observation and correlation. Th=\r\ne mind can of course be trained. However, a seeker of self-realization need=\r\n not actively pursue such an ability, for it serves no useful purpose in Se=\r\nlf-realization.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nThe ability to \ncalm the vibr=\r\nations in the mind due to conditioning and then the ability to calm any vib=\r\nrations due to resonance is more important than the \nability to discern the=\r\n source of vibrations.\n=C2=A0\nWhether a thought that vibrates one&#39;s mind ri=\r\nght now is coming from one&#39;s own conditioning or sensory observation or som=\r\neone else&#39;s, is not the crux. The crux is knowing whether one should perfor=\r\nm any physical/mental *action* based on thought, to fulfill one&#39;s swa-dharm=\r\na, or just observe the thought and leave it (move on). A true seeker&#39;s focu=\r\ns will be on that ability, i.e. developing clarity regarding one&#39;s own dhar=\r\nma, than figuring out the source of each thought. The latter can be a distr=\r\naction or even an ego trap.\n=C2=A0\nNevertheless, Nature may sometimes give =\r\none abilities that one does not actively pursue or need (perhaps because on=\r\ne desired it long back). A true seeker neither tries for nor resists what i=\r\ns not needed by one. One does not dwell on it in either case and moves on.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nOne may argue that certain special abilities=\r\n can help one pay off karmik debts on one&#39;s way to liberation. However, one=\r\n can (must) trust Nature to arrange for circumstances to pay off one&#39;s debt=\r\ns. The key is to be aware of what one can give others in any given circumst=\r\nance and give it without holding back. If one gets used to giving without e=\r\nxpecting any payback, Nature will automatically arrange for all of one&#39;s de=\r\nbts to be paid off. No special abilities are needed.\n=C2=A0\nOf course, when=\r\n there is a clash between giving thing X to person A vs giving\n thing Y to =\r\nperson B, one needs to use one&#39;s discretion. That is where our conditioning=\r\n may block us from the right call. As we know our dharma better and get a s=\r\nense of which of our dharmas are higher, we may start to make the right cal=\r\nls.\n=C2=A0\nThe bottomline: Try to know your dharma (declared by the spark o=\r\nf divinity in heart). Try to follow it to the best of ability. Give whateve=\r\nr you can give others, without expecting any payback. Ignore thoughts arisi=\r\nng in mind, which do not contribute to fulfillment of your dharma, no matte=\r\nr what the source of that thought may be.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nBef=\r\nore I sign off, a\n couple of words on Rakta Chamunda from the story above.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nThe verb cham means to \ndrink/eat/consume. The verb mund means to sh=\r\nave or deplete. Chamunda \nmeans one who drinks and finishes. Rakta means co=\r\nnditioning or coloring \n(the words rakti (attachment) and virakti (detachme=\r\nnt) come from the \nsame root). Rakta Chamunda is the one who drinks and emp=\r\nties all \nconditioning that causes desires. Offering blood is an approximat=\r\nion.

It did not seem natural to him and so he did n=\r\not act on that instinct though it re-appeared in his mind several times tha=\r\nt\n day. He ignored it as an unnatural thought for him.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;A coupl=\r\ne of days later, he received a mail from someone close to him but living 10=\r\n00s of miles away. This person happened to go to a smashan that weekend nig=\r\nht for meditation and saw some Tantriks doing a\n &quot;Rakta Chamunda&quot; homam. Th=\r\ney were offering ingredients dipped in their blood in homam. He just sat th=\r\nere and observed them. He later sent a mail about it.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When the=\r\n original person received the mail, he realized why he had that thought a c=\r\nouple of days back. His mind was simply resonating to the thoughts of the o=\r\nther person, without a complete awareness. In fact, such a thing happened t=\r\no him several times with the same person.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;There were also many=\r\n occasions when he would randomly talk about some topic and one specific pe=\r\nrson in the room would claim that that person was thinking about exactly th=\r\nat topic. Again, the question in the mind of that person resonated in the o=\r\nther mind and the person started talking about it.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_57&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D=\r\n&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_58 yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2554_1=\r\n373624150759_58\n yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2741_1373624150759_59 yiv9980592182=\r\nyui_3_7_2_3201_1373624150759_60&quot; id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_13736241=\r\n50759_59&quot; style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 13px; font-family: arial=\r\n, helvetica, clean, sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: =\r\nnormal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1=\r\n373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;=\r\nFirst, how does this work? Simple - resonance between minds.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;S=\r\nuppose you are talking loud. You may not hear what others around you are sa=\r\nying. Similarly, if your mind is vibrating with too many thoughts, it may n=\r\not resonate to the vibrations in other minds around it.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&lt;span\n id=3D&quot;yiv=\r\n9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;But, if you are relatively calm,=\r\n you can hear what others are saying. Similarly, if your mind is relatively=\r\n calm, it may pick up vibrations in other minds around it (or even 1000s of=\r\n miles away if there is some attachment/connection) and resonate to those v=\r\nibrations!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_20=\r\n26_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_137362=\r\n4150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;=\r\nyiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Second, how to know where the thought is comin=\r\ng from?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When an infant listens to tens of voices, he simply he=\r\nars different sounds and does not know from which face each sound is coming=\r\n from. Over time, after many observations and correlations, brain learns to=\r\n discern from which face each sound is coming from. Later, one may\n recogni=\r\nze a voice even when the face is behind a curtain or otherwise invisible!&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, if one so wishes, one can develop the ability to dis=\r\ncern the source of each thought that vibrates the mind, after much observat=\r\nion and correlation. The mind can of course be trained. However, a seeker o=\r\nf self-realization need not actively pursue such an ability, for it serves =\r\nno useful purpose in Self-realization.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9=\r\n980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182=\r\nyui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv998=\r\n0592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_=\r\n2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;The ability to \ncalm the vibrations in the mind due =\r\nto conditioning and then the ability\n to calm any vibrations due to resonan=\r\nce is more important than the \nability to discern the source of vibrations.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_=\r\n68&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;Whether a thought that vibrates one&#39;s mind right now is coming f=\r\nrom one&#39;s own conditioning or sensory observation or someone else&#39;s, is not=\r\n the crux. The crux is knowing whether one should perform any physical/ment=\r\nal *action* based on thought, to fulfill one&#39;s swa-dharma, or just observe =\r\nthe thought and leave it (move on). A true seeker&#39;s focus will be on that a=\r\nbility, i.e. developing clarity regarding one&#39;s own dharma, than figuring o=\r\nut the source of each thought. The latter can be a distraction or even an e=\r\ngo trap.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Nevertheless, Nature may sometimes give one abilities=\r\n that one does not actively pursue or need (perhaps because one desired it =\r\nlong back). A true seeker neither tries for nor resists what is not needed =\r\nby one. One does not dwell on it in either case and moves on.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span\n id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_13=\r\n73624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;O=\r\nne may argue that certain &lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_13=\r\n73624150759_68&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;s=\r\npecial &lt;/span&gt;abilities can help one pay off karmik debts on one&#39;s way to l=\r\niberation. However, one can (must) trust Nature to arrange for circumstance=\r\ns to pay off one&#39;s debts. The key is to be aware of what one can give other=\r\ns in any given circumstance and give it without holding back. If one gets u=\r\nsed to giving without expecting any payback, Nature will automatically arra=\r\nnge for all of one&#39;s debts to be paid off. No special abilities are needed.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Of course, when there is a clash between giving thing X to pe=\r\nrson A vs giving\n thing Y to person B, one needs to use one&#39;s discretion. T=\r\nhat is where our conditioning may block us from the right call. As we know =\r\nour dharma better and get a sense of which of our dharmas are higher, we ma=\r\ny start to make the right calls.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;The bottomline: Try to know y=\r\nour dharma (declared by the spark of divinity in heart). Try to follow it t=\r\no the best of ability. Give whatever you can give others, without expecting=\r\n any payback. Ignore thoughts arising in mind, which do not contribute to f=\r\nulfillment of your dharma, no matter what the source of that thought may be=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759=\r\n_68&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;*&lt;/span&gt;&lt;spa=\r\nn id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_13736=\r\n24150759_68&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Befo=\r\nre I sign off, a\n couple of words on Rakta Chamunda from the story above.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_137362415=\r\n0759_68&quot;&gt;&lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv9980592182yui_3_7_2_2026_1373624150759_68&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Th=\r\ne verb cham means to \ndrink/eat/consume.
