However, i came across an arti=\r\ncle saying if i woke up and go out of the mat, the benefit would be transfe=\r\nrred to Lord Indra. The article goes like this;\n&gt; \n&gt; Lord Indra worshiped L=\r\nord Shiva. Pleased with his devotion Lord Shiva appeared and ask Lord Indra=\r\n to ask for a boon. Lord Indra asked, that let he be blessed to snatch ever=\r\nyone&#39;s fruit of bhakti/devotion, because he fear that someone will take ove=\r\nr his Kingdom by winning a boon from any God.\n&gt; Lord Shiva persuaded him to=\r\n ask for something else, because not everyone is seeking to ousted Lord Ind=\r\nra. Upon his (Lord Indra&#39;s) persistence Lord Shiva and he came upon an agre=\r\nement, that if anyone, in eternity is sitting doing any devotion, it be Jap=\r\na, Tarpan, Marjan, Homa/Havan, Shradha or any rites, if the person stands u=\r\np from his asana/mat and leave. Then the fruit or benefit of that ritual or=\r\n undertaking will go to Lord Indra.\n&gt; But if the person or devotee puts a d=\r\nrop or two of water underneath the asana/mat and touch this water, with his=\r\n ring finger puts a tilak or puts a dot of that water on his forehead or be=\r\ntween the eyebrows, the benefit or fruit of that particular ritual, sadhana=\r\n or devotion will remain with the devotee. Lord Indra will not be able to s=\r\nnatch the fruit of that devotion.\n&gt; This simple act keeps the fruit of your=\r\n devotion with you! No one can snatch the benefit from you, not even Lord I=\r\nndra.\n&gt; That&#39;s why many a times, I have been asked why is that one is prayi=\r\nng to God for so long with no benefit or fruit of that devotion. Why God is=\r\n not listening? Well, when I explain the above story to them, it raises the=\r\nir eyebrows. When they adopt this simple act, they start seeing results! Th=\r\ne benefit or fruit of their devotion remain with them, forever!\n&gt; \n&gt; Please=\r\n advise me.\n&gt; Thank You.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
