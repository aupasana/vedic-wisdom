When a sage begins to perform a severe tapas on earth, the seat of Indr=\r\na becomes unstable. He feels like his throne is about to be taken away and =\r\nhe grows anxious and tries to create various obstacles in the rishi&#39;s tapas=\r\n by creating strong winds, fire, rain or cold or by sending apsasaras.\n\nThi=\r\ns corresponds beautifully with what happens in the microcosm. Indra, the ki=\r\nng of gods, corresponds with the mind, the king of senses. Just like Indra =\r\nis constantly engaged in watching the apsaras similarly the mind is constan=\r\ntly engaged in indulging in the material world. Whenever a good quality (li=\r\nke detachment etc) begins to manifest in us, the mind becomes=A0 unsteady=\r\n=A0 (Indra&#39;s throne beginning to become unsteady) and it feels like it is g=\r\noing to be conquered (after all spiritual progress involves extinguishing t=\r\nhe mind). It grows anxious. The mind sends various thoughts like lust (send=\r\ning of apsaras by Indra) etc to obstruct the tapas (manifestation of good q=\r\nualities in us).\n\nI do not claim originality to this idea.
