Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep\n&gt; &gt; doing sadhana and =\r\nNature will teach in the best possible way.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I know one person with sp=\r\niritual inclination who went on a long pilgrimage visiting many temples and=\r\n ashrams in India. He was hoping that he would meet a realized master who w=\r\nould bless him and give him a big push spiritually. He was an old classmate=\r\n of Manish and Manish was telling him from the beginning that he would not =\r\nfind anyone like that. Manish told him to just sit at home and do intense s=\r\nadhana - homam, japam etc. But still that person wanted to go around in sea=\r\nrch of a guru who would lift him. No need to say he did not find anyone lik=\r\ne that.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; We indeed had spiritual masters in =\r\nthe past who were capable of lifting people just like that. However, such m=\r\nasters are rare today. In fact, Paramahansa Yogananda said that great maste=\r\nrs will no longer descend to earth in coming years. I interpret what he sai=\r\nd slightly differently. Some great masters may still descend to earth in fu=\r\nture, but they may not act like the sadgurus of past. They may only show th=\r\ne (a) path and leave responsibility in the hands of people.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Why shoul=\r\nd it be so?\n&gt;  \n&gt; The age of fake swamis and babas who are secretly after n=\r\name and money has dawned (or will soon dawn) on earth. They will pretend to=\r\n be realized masters though they are not. They will be difficult to discern=\r\n. This is going to render futile for many the search for a sadguru to whom =\r\none can completely surrender. In the old days, if you found a sadguru, surr=\r\nendered to him/her and followed his/her commands blindly, your life would b=\r\ne made and you would achieve whatever was meant to be achieved spiritually =\r\nin that life. However, the same cannot be said about following a fake guru =\r\nblindly. In an age when there are probably going to be far more fake gurus =\r\nthan sadgurus, isn&#39;t it advisable to rewrite the blueprint of a spiritual j=\r\nourney? Instead of searching for a sadguru and surrendering to him, it may =\r\nbe better for most seekers to just do sadhana and take God or Fire as guru =\r\nas Rajarshi wisely said.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The old thinking will slowly be replaced by =\r\na new model appropriate for the new times. What Paramahansa Yogananda said =\r\nis along the same lines. More developments in future may re-inforce the new=\r\n approach.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Paramahansa Yogananda said that =\r\ngreat masters will not descend to earth in future. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa =\r\nsaid that he would be back after about 100 years accompanied by others who =\r\naccompanied him earlier and that many people would be liberated en masse th=\r\nis time. How do we reconcile?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Quite possibly, Ramakrishna will not do=\r\n any miracles or touch people and grant them liberation just like that, but=\r\n he will probably show them how to find god. He will not take them to god h=\r\nimself, but point them to a path that will lead to god. He will probably in=\r\nspire many people to do intense sadhana and become liberated.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the old days, we had brave kshatriyas who were very d=\r\nharmik and unselfish. It made sense to put power completely and uncondition=\r\nally in their hands. It worked for the benefit of all. As such kshatriyas b=\r\necame rare and world started to be dominated by adharmik and selfish seeker=\r\ns of power, Nature adjusted the course of humanity and most of the world is=\r\n today based on the concept of democracy or switching to it slowly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; I=\r\nn spiritual matters also, we had learned braahmanas who were very dharmik, =\r\nunselfish and liberated. it made sense to place people&#39;s spiritual lives co=\r\nmpletely and unconditionally in their hands. As such braahmanas become rare=\r\n and world starts to be dominated by adharmik and selfish possessors of kno=\r\nwledge (who are still in the web of Maayaa), Nature may adjust the course o=\r\nf humanity and redefine religion and spiritual progress based on more relev=\r\nant concepts and ideas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The bottomline: If =\r\nyou like a guru or his teachings, benefit from them. But do not worry about=\r\n finding a sadguru as given in some scriptures and just keep doing sadhana.=\r\n Surrender to god, do homam/japam etc and wait patiently. It is a more frui=\r\ntful method than to search for a sadguru who will lift you.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best rega=\r\nrds,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writin=\r\ngs,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; =\r\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a d=\r\nifference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/gro=\r\nup/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namast=\r\ne,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I too believe we should give the benefit of doubt to Swami Nit=\r\nyananda. There are some questions one has to ask here:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 1) How rel=\r\niable is vedio. Tehelka, which did the sting operation, is a VERY questiona=\r\nble organization.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 2) Second, how does one know whether Swami Nity=\r\nananda was not practising say some sexual ritual?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; 3) What exactly=\r\n is the big fuss if a Swami, and a reasonable good one, has sex with someon=\r\ne?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; We live in such times where Mahamaya has made it almost imposs=\r\nible for even VERY advanced souls to remain perfect brahmacharis from birth=\r\n till death. Souls who might have been brahmacharis in all previous births,=\r\n would probably not be able to remain so when born in thid age is a simple =\r\nfact of nature, otherwise how else is Kali Yuga to be different from other =\r\nyugas? She wants it that way and so it is that way.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Further, in t=\r\nhis age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so twisted and complex that=\r\n untill you pay back the rnas, it will keep hounding you. How is one going =\r\nto overcome that? Our society too is steeped in unnecessary prudishness and=\r\n misconceptions about lust and spirituality. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; All said and done, =\r\nVimalanada - whom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints who lived - t=\r\nook 6 years of struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sadhus =\r\nand saints?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that Swami Nityana=\r\nnda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to come, the idea=\r\n of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God as his/her gur=\r\nu and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way.
