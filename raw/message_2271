But in sleep, when you do not\n=\r\nattend to any second or third person, you do not experience any misery.\nOve=\r\nrlooking the peaceful happiness that you experienced while asleep, you\nsear=\r\nch for happiness in the waking state by attending to innumerable\nexternal o=\r\nbjects. However, does not the fact that you experienced happiness\nduring sl=\r\neep in the absence of those objects, indicate that happiness lies\nnot in th=\r\ne objects but in you, the first person or subject? Therefore why\nnot you tr=\r\ny, even in the waking state, to attend not to second and third\npersons but =\r\nto the first person =91I=92 ?=94\n\nOn hearing this, however, some devotees w=\r\nonder whether it is necessary then\nto withdraw from all activities in order=\r\n to be able to practise\nSelf-attention. =93If we are to follow this sadhana=\r\n of Self--attention in all\nearnestness, will not work prove to be an obstac=\r\nle? But if we give up all\nwork, how are we to provide the food, clothing an=\r\nd shelter required by the\nbody?=94 they ask. However, whenever devotees ask=\r\ned Sri Bhagavan such\nquestions, He used to reply thatwork need not be a hin=\r\ndrance to spiritual\npractice (sadhana). This does not mean, of course, that=\r\n an aspirant should\nwork in the same spirit as a wordly man or that he shou=\r\nld work with the same\naim in view. The spirit in which and the aim with whi=\r\nch an aspirant should\nwork in this world, can be illustrated by the followi=\r\nng example:\n\nSuppose a businessman rents a shop in the heart of a big city =\r\nfor Rs.\n1,000/- a month. If from his business he aims to make only sufficie=\r\nnt money\nto pay the rent for the shop, will it not be a worthless business?=\r\n Should\nnot his aim in renting the shop be to earn a profit of Rs. 10,000/-=\r\n a month?\nOn the other hand, if he does not make sufficient money even to p=\r\nay the\nrent, will he be able to remain in the shop to earn his profit?\n\nOur=\r\n body is like the shop rented by the businessman.The aim with which we\nrent=\r\n this body is to realize Self, while the rent we have to pay for the\nbody i=\r\ns food, clothing and shelter. In order to pay this rent, it is\nnecessary fo=\r\nr us to work, using the mind, speech and body as our\ninstruments. If we do =\r\nnot pay the rent, we cannot live in the body and earn\nthe great profit of S=\r\nelf-knowledge. However, we should not spend our whole\nlife-all our time and=\r\n effortin working to pay the rent. The mind, speech and\nbody should work on=\r\nly for that amount of time and with that amount of effort\nwhich is required=\r\n for paying the rent =96 for providing the food, clothing and\nshelter neces=\r\nsary for the body. If instead we devote all our time and effort\ntowards acc=\r\numulating comforts and conveniences for the body, as worldly\npeople do, we =\r\nwould be just like the worthless businessman who works only to\npay the rent=\r\n and who never tries to make a profit. Therefore, a sincere\naspirant should=\r\n arrange his work in such a way that he will spend only a\nportion of his ti=\r\nme and energy for maintaining the body, so that he can\nutilize the remainin=\r\ng time and energy in striving to earn the great profit\nof Self-knowledge.\n\n=\r\nFor some aspirants prarabdha will be arranged by God or Guru in such a way\n=\r\nthat they need to do little or no work to maintain their body, whereas for\n=\r\nother aspirants it may be arranged in such a way that they have to spend\nmo=\r\nst of their time in working for the maintenance of the body. But in\nwhateve=\r\nr way the prarabdha is arranged, it is arranged only for the\naspirant=92s o=\r\nwn good, that is, for his ultimate attainment of\nSelf-knowledge. Moreover,\n=\r\nsince prarabdha determines only the outward activities of the body and mind=\r\n,\nit can in no way obstruct the inward desire and yearning for Self-knowled=\r\nge.\nIf one has an intense yearning for Self-knowledge, the Guru=92s Grace w=\r\nill\ncertainly help one in all ways, both from within and without, to enable=\r\n one\nto attend to Self.\n\nSource: The Path of Sri Ramana Part 1 Book By Sri =\r\nSadhu Om\n\n-- \nLove And Love Alone\n\nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth =\r\nJalasutram\n\r\n--000e0cd24b2682ad7804712a7989\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family: Verdana; color: rgb(=\r\n51, 51, 51); &quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;post-body entry-content&quot; style=3D&quot;margin-top: =\r\n0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-heigh=\r\nt: 1.3em; &quot;&gt;\nKnowing that all misery arises only as a result of the fundame=\r\nntal error =96 the original sin =96 of attending to second and third person=\r\ns instead of attending to and knowing the true nature of the first person, =\r\nBhagavan Sri Ramana graciously appeared on earth to advise humanity, =93Thr=\r\noughout the waking and dream states you attend only to second and third per=\r\nsons, and in consequence you experience endless misery.=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;But in sleep, when you do not attend to any second or th=\r\nird person, you do not experience any misery.
