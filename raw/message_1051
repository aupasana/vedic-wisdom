So you may do e=\r\nither.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, some combinations tried by others successfully in=\r\n the past \n&gt; are better and faster.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Regarding the specific mantra=\r\n below: The words &quot;raam&quot; and &quot;jay&quot; \n&gt; (or &quot;jai&quot;) have no meaning in Sanskri=\r\nt. They should be &quot;raama&quot; \n&gt; and &quot;jaya&quot; respectively. Arabic has words most=\r\nly ending in consonants \n&gt; (i.e. no vowel &quot;a&quot; at the end of the word). That=\r\n Arabic influence \n&gt; made Indians change Sanskrit words to remove &quot;a&quot; at th=\r\ne end of \n&gt; words. &quot;Jaya Raama&quot; becomes &quot;Jay Raam&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If you want y=\r\nour mantra to be meaningful in Sanskrit, please \n&gt; restore &quot;a&quot; at the end o=\r\nf words. The correct version of the mantra \n&gt; is &quot;Sree Raama Jaya Raama Jay=\r\na Jaya Raama&quot;. You can add &quot;Om&quot; at the \n&gt; beginning.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *  =\r\n      *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; On our India trip in the summer of 2008, I and my guru we=\r\nnt to many \n&gt; temples. There was one remote temple in BriahdDwaraka that ha=\r\nd a nice \n&gt; level of spiritual vibrations. It is a temple of Hanuman and \n&gt;=\r\n Makaradhwaja (Hanuman&#39;s son) together. Apparently some yogi did \n&gt; intense=\r\n sadhana there for a few decades in the past (with the mantra \n&gt; you mentio=\r\nned). The mantra above is written all over the walls of the \n&gt; temple.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Though that yogi is not there now, the vibrations created by his \n&gt; s=\r\nadhana are still there. We were quite impressed when we spent some \n&gt; time =\r\nthere. You have to take a boat to go from Dwaarakaa to \n&gt; BrihadDwaarakaa a=\r\nnd then go inside the village (a few km from the \n&gt; main Krishna temple at =\r\nBrihadDwaarakaa). It is a very small temple \n&gt; without any crowd, but has s=\r\ntronger spiritual energy than many famous \n&gt; temples. If any of you go to D=\r\nwaraka or Gujarat in general, I \n&gt; recommend visiting that temple and spend=\r\ning a couple of hours there.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The mantra you gave reminded me of t=\r\nhat temple.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself=\r\n: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http=\r\n://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home=\r\n.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;   From: Jyotisa Shisya \n&gt; &gt;   To: =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;   Sent: Tuesday, January 27, 2009 7:48 AM=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kuja (Mars) homam manual available now\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   |om|\n&gt; &gt;   Dear Fellow travellers, namaste\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   A=\r\nll this talk about Mangal reminds me about one question I&#39;ve had \n&gt; for qui=\r\nte sometime. Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to \n&gt; any Hanuman =\r\ntemple and get a mantra for lifting up the Mangal in my \n&gt; natal chart whic=\r\nh suffers from rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and neecha \n&gt; in navamsa). When I =\r\nvisited the Hanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha \n&gt; Perumal temple, Thirumazhis=\r\nai near Chennai and asked the priest about \n&gt; a mantra, he advised me to ch=\r\nant the mantra inscribed on the walls of \n&gt; the temple |sri ram jaya ram ja=\r\nya jaya ram| which comes out to be a 7 \n&gt; word, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy =\r\nfrom the 7th house to the 10th house \n&gt; with the mantra devata sitting in l=\r\nagna as per mantra shastra \n&gt; teachings. I&#39;ve been doing this every evening=\r\n since.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Later I came to know this is the Rama taraka mantra=\r\n. My question \n&gt; is how does this mantra help to counter the rajabhanga of =\r\nMangal?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Secondly what is the correct form of the Rama tarak=\r\na mantra? Is it\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   |om sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| - 8 wor=\r\nds, 11 aksharas\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   or\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   |om sri rama jaya rama j=\r\naya jaya rama|? - 8 words, 14 aksharas\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Some say it should b=\r\ne 13 aksharas....\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Sorry for astrological content in this ma=\r\nil.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   best regards\n&gt; &gt;   Hari\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
