Sincerity & intensity of \n&gt; Intentions are 2 of the most valuable of attributes. If one is ready \n&gt; for certain level of Sadhana, one will get all the resources by \n&gt; supreme power. if one is ready for so called &quot;Mahavidya Sadhana&quot;, one \n&gt; will be provided suitable resources for that. even real teacher will \n&gt; come at ones door-step to teach. To give an instcance, I know a friend \n&gt; who is doing Homa, Chandi paath and such Sadhana for few years. though \n&gt; he has devotion to form of Mother Goddess, he has no desire for \n&gt; Mahavidya sadhana and does not even do casual search for any \n&gt; informnations on the internet. he knows that Mother will provde the \n&gt; intense desire and resources at the right time if at all that Sadhana \n&gt; is needed.\n&gt; really, for almost everybody, specifically for people got in to family \n&gt; business, the only bhavana needs to be developed is to become a child \n&gt; of Supreme Mother (Jagadamba or Rama or Krishna or Shiva or Budhha or \n&gt; Guru or Rishi or jesus or Allah or...) in present world.\n&gt; I have highest admiration for Thakur Ramakrishna or Vimalananda \n&gt; because they both gave the Identical message which is the most \n&gt; important message of our time atleast-IMO. &quot;Be a child in the lap of \n&gt; devine Mother&quot; and then Mahavidya or even post-Mahavidya will be \n&gt; provided, if needed.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Utpal\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &lt;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; \n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; All this is just a tamasha.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mahavidya means supreme knowledge.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Mahavidyas are those subtle forms of the primordial energy that create\n&gt; &gt; various fine bindings within the field of duality that are very\n&gt; &gt; difficult for ego to break free from. They are also the subtle forms of\n&gt; &gt; primordial energy that break the *last vestiges* of bondage that are\n&gt; &gt; trapping ego.

Even so called Vedic Sadhanas are often done for \n&gt; material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gains. Recall how most of the Sanskrit stotras of various deities\n&gt; &gt; &gt; contain a phalastuti (the expected results), is that not material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gain? Doing a Mahamrityunjaya Mantra for health benefits, isn&#39;t \n&gt; that a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; material gain? It is not the path, but the attitude of the sadhaka\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which determines for what he/she is performing a certain sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yogis and/or those who do sadhana using &#39;Vedic&#39; tools also acquire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; siddhis. Yogis acquire siddhis, which can come as a byproduct of the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; path. The problem is not with siddhis per se, it is with misusing \n&gt; them\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or commercializing them or hanging on to them. Any sadhaka who can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gain a siddhi, can also let go of that siddhi whenever he/she wants.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Speaking of Karma, everything has a karma of it&#39;s own. Tantra, as it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stands today, is roughly divided into two major geographic and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; philosophical demarcations. The style practiced in South India -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mostly Dakshina Margi - and that practiced in Bengal and adjacent\n&gt; &gt; &gt; areas - mostly Vama Margi. In my personal opinion, the adherents of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the path in both cases, generally speaking, have been trapped in two\n&gt; &gt; &gt; delusions born out of collateral byproducts of their respective \n&gt; paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The first step of Shakti sadhana is generating shakti. Second step is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; holding the shakti. Third step is channeling the shakti. In view of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this, one school of Tantra that is prevalent today has tied itself up\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in too much of technicalities, such that on an average they forget to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; capture shakti (here shakti means energy, not Shakti the supreme\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Goddess). WHile the other school is able to generate and hold shakti\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much better, only to commercialize the same and/or misuse it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (generally speaking, expcetions are there too). End result, both\n&gt; &gt; &gt; eventually do not end up producing enough genuine Tantrik saints.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; i am wondering &quot;if at all&quot; and &quot;what kind&quot; of karmic liabilities\n&gt; &gt; &gt; one might be getting into ?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; A fair exchange is never a robbery, as Vimalananda says.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Theoretically, when the *right person* performs many of the things\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mentioned in that blog, (and some of the stuff there is not exactly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; accurately portrayed), he/she will know how to balance the karmic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; impact well. In the hands of an immature individual, it can lead to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; disaster. Further, the so called division between &#39;classical Tantra&#39;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and &#39;folk Tantra&#39; is not as sharp and clear as it is made out there.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Each influences the other and is very much intermingled.�, Every\n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana in Vama Margi Tantra has a firm spiritual basis. Performed\n&gt; &gt; &gt; correctly, with the right attitude, and by the right individual, it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; leads to very high spiritual states.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards �, Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; �, Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.

At the end one has to drop everything to\n    Attain the liberation.&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    As the vedic rishis said the the goal of human lifes is to attain\n    liberation, life after life they will be lead towards liberation.\n    Remember the River always flows towards sea to unite with that.&lt;br&gt;\n    and understand that &quot;The Fish is Already in the Sea.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n    Suresha H&lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    &lt;br&gt;\n    On 2012/06/15 11:38 AM, vedic_pathak wrote:\n    &lt;blockquote cite=&quot;mid:jrejhq+72ii@...&quot; type=&quot;cite&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;span style=&quot;display:none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n      \n          &lt;div id=&quot;ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n            &lt;p&gt;namaste to all,&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n              I would like to add my few thoughts here. Sincerity &amp;\n              intensity of Intentions are 2 of the most valuable of\n              attributes. If one is ready for certain level of Sadhana,\n              one will get all the resources by supreme power. if one is\n              ready for so called &quot;Mahavidya Sadhana&quot;, one will be\n              provided suitable resources for that. even real teacher\n              will come at ones door-step to teach. To give an\n              instcance, I know a friend who is doing Homa, Chandi paath\n              and such Sadhana for few years. though he has devotion to\n              form of Mother Goddess, he has no desire for Mahavidya\n              sadhana and does not even do casual search for any\n              informnations on the internet. he knows that Mother will\n              provde the intense desire and resources at the right time\n              if at all that Sadhana is needed.&lt;br&gt;\n              really, for almost everybody, specifically for people got\n              in to family business, the only bhavana needs to be\n              developed is to become a child of Supreme Mother\n              (Jagadamba or Rama or Krishna or Shiva or Budhha or Guru\n              or Rishi or jesus or Allah or...) in present world. &lt;br&gt;\n              I have highest admiration for Thakur Ramakrishna or\n              Vimalananda because they both gave the Identical message\n              which is the most important message of our time\n              atleast-IMO. &quot;Be a child in the lap of devine Mother&quot; and\n              then Mahavidya or even post-Mahavidya will be provided, if\n              needed.&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n              Best Regards,&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n              Utpal&lt;br&gt;\n              &lt;br&gt;\n              --- In &lt;a moz-do-not-send=&quot;true&quot;\n                href=&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;,\n              Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;a class=&quot;moz-txt-link-rfc2396E&quot; href=&quot;mailto:pvr@...&quot;&gt;&lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;/a&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; Namaste friends,&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; All this is just a tamasha.&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; Mahavidya means supreme knowledge.&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; Mahavidyas are those subtle forms of the primordial\n              energy that create &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; various fine bindings within the field of duality\n              that are very &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; difficult for ego to break free from.

Even so called Vedic Sadhanas are\n              often done for material &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; gains. Recall how most of the Sanskrit stotras\n              of various deities &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; contain a phalastuti (the expected results), is\n              that not material &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; gain? Doing a Mahamrityunjaya Mantra for health\n              benefits, isn&#39;t that a &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; material gain? It is not the path, but the\n              attitude of the sadhaka &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; which determines for what he/she is performing a\n              certain sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; Yogis and/or those who do sadhana using &#39;Vedic&#39;\n              tools also acquire &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; siddhis. Yogis acquire siddhis, which can come\n              as a byproduct of the &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; path. The problem is not with siddhis per se, it\n              is with misusing them &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; or commercializing them or hanging on to them.\n              Any sadhaka who can &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; gain a siddhi, can also let go of that siddhi\n              whenever he/she wants.&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; Speaking of Karma, everything has a karma of\n              it&#39;s own. Tantra, as it &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; stands today, is roughly divided into two major\n              geographic and &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; philosophical demarcations. The style practiced\n              in South India - &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; mostly Dakshina Margi - and that practiced in\n              Bengal and adjacent &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; areas - mostly Vama Margi. In my personal\n              opinion, the adherents of &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; the path in both cases, generally speaking, have\n              been trapped in two &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; delusions born out of collateral byproducts of\n              their respective paths. &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; The first step of Shakti sadhana is generating\n              shakti. Second step is &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; holding the shakti. Third step is channeling the\n              shakti. In view of &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; this, one school of Tantra that is prevalent\n              today has tied itself up &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; in too much of technicalities, such that on an\n              average they forget to &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; capture shakti (here shakti means energy, not\n              Shakti the supreme &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; Goddess). WHile the other school is able to\n              generate and hold shakti &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; much better, only to commercialize the same\n              and/or misuse it &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; (generally speaking, expcetions are there too).\n              End result, both &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; eventually do not end up producing enough\n              genuine Tantrik saints.&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; &lt;&lt; i am wondering &quot;if at all&quot; and &quot;what\n              kind&quot; of karmic liabilities &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; one might be getting into ?&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; A fair exchange is never a robbery, as\n              Vimalananda says. &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; Theoretically, when the *right person* performs\n              many of the things &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; mentioned in that blog, (and some of the stuff\n              there is not exactly &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; accurately portrayed), he/she will know how to\n              balance the karmic &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; impact well. In the hands of an immature\n              individual, it can lead to &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; disaster. Further, the so called division\n              between &#39;classical Tantra&#39; &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; and &#39;folk Tantra&#39; is not as sharp and clear as\n              it is made out there. &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; Each influences the other and is very much\n              intermingled.&Atilde;&#8218; Every &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; sadhana in Vama Margi Tantra has a firm\n              spiritual basis. Performed &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; correctly, with the right attitude, and by the\n              right individual, it &lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; leads to very high spiritual states.&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; -Regards &Atilde;&#8218; Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n              &gt; &gt; &Atilde;&#8218; Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.
