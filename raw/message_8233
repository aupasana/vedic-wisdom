Thank you for this information that Parshads do not want t=\r\no accept Bali through fire.\n\nHowever, there is a technical point here. If h=\r\navan Kunda is large enough to place Balis on the Base of kunda at prescribe=\r\nd places, it would be probably ok because One does not intend to offer bali=\r\n in fire.\n\nanyways, I liked the &quot;Pradakshina&quot; idea while placing the Balis =\r\noutside and that seems Ideal if the setup allows to do that. My setup does =\r\nnot allow to do me Pradakshina at all.\n\nRegards,\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nBalis are given for beings who do not want to accept things through \n&gt; fire=\r\n.
