But, in general, let us be less \ndefensive and instead focus on subject. Knowing Ajit&#39;s nature, I knew \nexactly what he meant. However, even if Ajit or someone actually said \nsomething negative about me, it is not a big deal. One is who one is and \nwords, good or bad, do not change that, for better or worse. Why be \nsensitive to words then?\n\nAjit, you are certainly qualified in commenting. I always knew that you have \ntremendous scholarship, great humility and sincerity. People far less \nqualified than you talk/write so much in today&#39;s world. Please do write \nmore.\n\nThe imagery thrown up by the Puranic story mentioned by you is really nice!\n\nFriends,\n\nLord Hanuman is one who fully overcame lust. He can be worshipped for giving \nself-control.\n\nLord Hrishikesha gives purity and control over senses (hrishika + isha = \nlord of senses). He can be worshipped for control over senses.\n\nMother Kaali gives dispassion and kills the root of desires. She can be \nworshipped for getting rid of desires.\n\nSeveral things are possible. But, for most people in today&#39;s times, it is \nnot going to be one magic bullet that does it, but a combination of various \npractices. Patience is needed.\n\nTry to increase the understanding of what is permanent and what is \ntransient.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, November 03, 2008 9:39 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya\n\n\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; Please accept my sincere apology as I misunderstood it completely.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best Regrads,\n&gt;\n&gt; utpal\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Ajit Krishnan&quot;\n&gt; &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; namaste,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; may i ask why you felt that it is a blind leading blind?\n&gt;&gt; Re-reading the formatting of my response, the question is\n&gt; justified.

This is truly a case of the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; blind leading\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the blind.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and it does not help in\n&gt; overcoming\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the basic\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; ...\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; True, suppressing desire will make the desire come back\n&gt; later.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; But, if one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; keeps fulfilling desires, they never end!!  This is the\n&gt; nature\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of desire.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; One of my favourite books is the mudgala-purana, which is a\n&gt; purana\n&gt;&gt; &gt; about\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ganesha. Here, Ganesha has 8 avatAras, which come to destroy 8\n&gt;&gt; &gt; demons: envy,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; lust, delusion, greed, anger, desire, &quot;my-ness&quot; and pride. In\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; chapter\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; where Ganesha destroys the &quot;desire demon&quot;, the demon is\n&gt; described\n&gt;&gt; &gt; as having\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; two children -- shoShaNa and duShpUra i.e. (1) one who dries\n&gt;&gt; &gt; things up /\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; destroys and (2) one who can never be satisfied.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Satisfying desire always results in fanning the fire of desire.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; And in the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; process, other things become neglected (dried up). Eventually,\n&gt; one\n&gt;&gt; &gt; feel&#39;s\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; guilt / shame, where, again, the heart literally feels like it\n&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; &gt; drying up.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ganesha comes to uproot the &quot;desire demon&quot; as the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; avatAra &quot;vikaTa&quot;, which\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; means &quot;one who is horrible / monstrous&quot;. The purana explains\n&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; we have to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; see things &quot;as they are&quot;. To do this, we should think of\n&gt; desired\n&gt;&gt; &gt; objects, as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; something horrible. The desire falls away, and we will be able\n&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; see\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Ganesha in his vikaTa form.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This technique is described in Shankaracharya&#39;s famous\n&gt; stotra &quot;moha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; mudgara&quot;, i.e. taking a hammer to &quot;delusion&quot;. This is also\n&gt; known\n&gt;&gt; &gt; as &quot;bhaja\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; govindam&quot;. Here, he teaches that we should repeatedly remember\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; female form is merely a modification (rather a horrible\n&gt;&gt; &gt; contortion) of flesh\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and fat.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, we pray to Ganesha, who illuminates the world, and shows\n&gt; it\n&gt;&gt; &gt; as it is,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; contorted and un-deserving of desire.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; bhavadIyaH,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;        ajit\n\n\n"}}
