Let me write down as I s=\r\nee it, in point by point manner.\n\n1. In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a li=\r\nst of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd =\r\nAvatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa De=\r\nva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu mentio=\r\nn that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa says=\r\n all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are amsas of the Supreme Being =\r\nwhile Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;\n\n2. Of these various possible Avataras, =\r\n10, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded special mention and si=\r\ngnificance across various Hindu spiritual literature, specially those which=\r\n were composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive,=\r\n it was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed the full effect o=\r\nf Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas were c=\r\nomposed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tan=\r\ntras]\n\n3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, =\r\nKurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and K=\r\nalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form and sequence of thes=\r\ne main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aquatic, to th=\r\ne amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf =\r\nman (first human life form who immediately takes possession of this earth r=\r\nepresented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama mov=\r\ning around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna =\r\nAvatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not to be sepa=\r\nrated into another world, but is a progressive realization of the various m=\r\nanifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousness and its =\r\ndevelopment through various life-forms. Larger spirituality of earth and ev=\r\nolution go hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s grand design for life on earth.\n\n=\r\n4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on the parable of these main=\r\n 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one worships say Matysa Avat=\r\nara, one will not attain to a state of liberation of the soul. As is the na=\r\nture of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can lead a person to an=\r\ny depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars of Vishnu are self-real=\r\nized in their own way and can be consider super-massive spiritual dynamos.\n=\r\n\n\n=C2=A05. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because the=\r\ny represent a stage of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which soc=\r\niety can relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the s=\r\ntage of most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known h=\r\now to transform the animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a=\r\n constructive force for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full=\r\n Sattwa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it=\r\n is static in nature and will change only when circumstances force it to. A=\r\ns per the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita=\r\n in the forest. He did have a moments fear before the final assault on Rava=\r\nna, which was dispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of th=\r\ne Sun to Rama. At the end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most d=\r\nispassionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it was\n t=\r\nhe Dharma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharm=\r\na of that age when he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epi=\r\nc, and I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the th=\r\nings as they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding hi=\r\ns own preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama =\r\nfaced which culminated into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most di=\r\nspassionate leader, such that no personal consideration or emotions or pass=\r\nions can overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leade=\r\nr must be!\n\nKrshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. =\r\nI am not taking his=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singul=\r\nar and constant detachment from situations, from people, from environment, =\r\nfrom circumstances that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to l=\r\neave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents, his villa=\r\nge-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for=\r\n him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village l=\r\nife and head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reaso=\r\nn with them, then he understood that they won&#39;t understand, he promised he =\r\nwill return back once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later=\r\n, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their=\r\n dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and=\r\n possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying th=\r\nat he\n belongs to everyone equally and no one has any special right over hi=\r\nm. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on=\r\n the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he s=\r\nwiftly cut off Shishupala&#39;s head and was back into his poise. But when Bhur=\r\nishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist and charlatan, Krs=\r\nhna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as anoth=\r\ner black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa i=\r\nn the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very ne=\r\nxt moment he was back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabhar=\r\nata is there one instance of his going overboard, never a single shade of d=\r\nepression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective=\r\n of what others say or think of him. And then right in the middle of the gr=\r\neatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime\n spirit=\r\nual philosophy. That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. =\r\nFor a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible=\r\n. Neither the action nor the results belong to the instrument. When running=\r\n away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bhe=\r\nema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema to hit Duryodhana below t=\r\nhe waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine=\r\n Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be lined up which would ca=\r\nuse the destruction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by =\r\nthe rational thinking. But happens when one is constantly and consciously c=\r\nonnected to the Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situa=\r\ntions in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if =\r\nwe take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, w=\r\ne get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a\n 1000 headed d=\r\nemon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Sh=\r\nakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we =\r\ntake only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is ver=\r\ny clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all =\r\nthe great characteristics of satwa, chief of which is self-control, as well=\r\n as the occasional sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom=\r\n, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna cre=\r\nates a true saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability is shak=\r\nen. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this world - m=\r\nan, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affecte=\r\nd any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the most=\r\n trying situations.\n\n6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this world. But=\r\n I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His realizatio=\r\nn, the one he advocated, is a static realization, an end in a void. This is=\r\n clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find this not in tune with=\r\n what either Rama or Krshna espoused. None of them negated this world. If n=\r\negation of this world and life is the final aim, then why send so many avat=\r\nars at crucial stages of evolutionary development? If the spiritual impact =\r\non masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not Jesus or =\r\nZorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But do they fit in =\r\nthe scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana indicate in =\r\na most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in parts of In=\r\ndia, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be complete a=\r\nnd holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of life as well as in=\r\nside of life.\n That is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spiritual p=\r\nhilosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an object of revere=\r\nnce and realization.\n\n7. The original literature of the Nath Yogis used to =\r\nmention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological functions. 6 inside t=\r\nhe human body and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most people, even seeke=\r\nrs. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding Buddha - corres=\r\npond to the full power and force of one of these 9 Chakras. Similarly, the =\r\n9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or allow the consciousness=\r\n to explore and express itself is various possiblities, are 9 in number. Th=\r\ne lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore the chief Avatars w=\r\nho represent the parable of evolution are nine in number. And the ninth of =\r\nthe sequence is yet to come.\n\n8. I cannot comment on which graha would typi=\r\ncally represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS says, however, it is=\r\n my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one cannot rule out some dee=\r\np-rooted corruption of understanding or textual misrepresentation in this K=\r\nali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not yet appeared. It will=\r\n be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghora books, Nishkalanka =\r\n- the stainless one. There is only one thing which is perfectly stainless, =\r\nthe Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes living in the full and co=\r\nmplete purity and might and force and strength of the Atmah. By the sheer d=\r\nint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away opposing forces of this w=\r\norld and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshna used diplomacy at va=\r\nrious points in his adult life to achieve his ends. Kalki, I am speculating=\r\n, won&#39;t even need that. The white horse and that sword is a metaphor. He wi=\r\nll be the only one\n capable enough to rectify the various errors and corrup=\r\ntions that beset our age. \n\nWell, this is how I look at the story of Avatar=\r\nas. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my views, but I am reasonably sang=\r\nuine now that this is what is closer to truth.\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\na=\r\nwaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwya=\r\nyamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\n________________________________\n From: Narasimha P=\r\n.V.R.

Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected example of how mind ope=\r\nrates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected example of how wisdom/discriminat=\r\nion operates.

Soul in us, mind in us, energy in us,\n learning spirit =\r\nin us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline/patience in us - all these=\r\n are different manifestations of the same Self. However, when Self manifest=\r\ns as these different aspects, it has different qualities and plays differen=\r\nt roles. There is no comparison between them.\n=C2=A0\nWe MAY focus on one as=\r\npect of us first, perfect it and then perfect other aspects through it. But=\r\n, we need balance between all aspects in the end. Similarly, these differen=\r\nt aspects of Supreme Being are incomparable and are in a balance working to=\r\ngether in the Cosmos.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nOne who is fascinated b=\r\ny the qualities of soul may like the story that demonstrates how soul opera=\r\ntes; one who is fascinated by the qualities of mind may like the story that=\r\n demonstrates how mind operates, and one who is fascinated by the qualities=\r\n of wisdom may like the story that\n demonstrates how wisdom operates. And s=\r\no on. But this is just a matter of taste and subjective preference.\n=C2=A0\n=\r\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nLet us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind.=\r\n Soul is seen as a representative of god in us, because of some basic attri=\r\nbutes of it. It is the higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes=\r\n.\n=C2=A0\nOnce mind fancies a separate existence with some agendas/desires, =\r\nsoul supports the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and=\r\n sees it as its dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of th=\r\nis individualized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning abi=\r\nlity, enjoyment, discipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no des=\r\nires/agendas/likes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and rec=\r\nords all of one&#39;s agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fru=\r\nits later\n on. It does all that despite full awareness that it is neither d=\r\noing those karmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of th=\r\ne individualized consciousness entertain the notion that they are doing thi=\r\nngs and begetting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It see=\r\ns that as its dharma and does it impassionately.\n=C2=A0\nNow, does this soun=\r\nd exciting? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of an impassionate witne=\r\nss supporting the play, may not seem interesting enough to some.\n=C2=A0\nOn =\r\nthe other hand, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly purs=\r\nuing those agendas, getting things and achieving things. Movement of mind i=\r\ns what keeps the individualization going!!! Though soul is the support for =\r\neverything else in the individualized consciousness, soul is a witness doin=\r\ng its dharma impassionately. It is mind that keeps the individualization go=\r\ning and brings in agendas and passion and even decides/affects\n every entit=\r\ny&#39;s dharma. That way, mind is really the &quot;boss&quot; of the individualization. N=\r\no wonder Krishna&#39;s life appeals more to one who may be excited by this desc=\r\nription!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nLord Krishna is obviously awe-inspi=\r\nring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in perspective.\n=C2=A0\nRama&#39;s life demonst=\r\nrates how soul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma Jnana from Vasi=\r\nshtha and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was his &quot;dharma&quot;. He helped=\r\n Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given kingdom. At the last moment=\r\n, his father banished him to forest at the behest of his step-mother and hi=\r\ns step-brother was given the throne. He had no complaints. Though his fathe=\r\nr, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty to various degrees, he himself =\r\nsupported and consoled all three and followed his dharma impassionately. Th=\r\nough he knew leaving Sita in the forest\n with Lakshmana and going after the=\r\n golden deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately when Sita insis=\r\nted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her and fought the b=\r\nattle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or faulted Lakshm=\r\nana for leaving her later. He accepted every life situation with no complai=\r\nnts and did the best possible action then. Even as he killed Ravana, he did=\r\n so without hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma. Even as Ravana=\r\n was dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some subjects that were=\r\n going to disappear with Ravana!\n=C2=A0\nRama is a perfect example of a libe=\r\nrated man with no desires or agendas who impassionately discharges one&#39;s dh=\r\narma arising from the momentum of karmas before liberation. THAT is basical=\r\nly what soul does!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nAs another example, let us=\r\n look at Lord\n Vaamana. His story is a perfect demonstration of how wisdom/=\r\ndiscrimination operates.\n=C2=A0\nHe was born as a learned pygmy. He filled t=\r\nhe entire cosmos to rid earth of a charitable demon king with many great qu=\r\nalities.\n=C2=A0\nWisdom/discrimination makes one humble and unassuming. When=\r\n one is doing good work but tainted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride or a=\r\nttachment), one&#39;s discrimination is not pleased until that pride is suppres=\r\nsed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s entire consciousness, then demonic qualities a=\r\nre completely suppressed.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nPlease think about=\r\n the other avataras.

In the Bhag=\r\nwata Purana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu. In this list of 22,=\r\n Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 10th Avatara. Dattatr=\r\neya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list, and then the Bhagaw=\r\nata Purana goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu are innumerable. In=\r\n the 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innumerable others, are =\r\namsas of the Supreme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhagawan.&quot;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: Courier New,courie=\r\nr,monaco,monospace,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style:\n =\r\nnormal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font=\r\n-family: Courier New,courier,monaco,monospace,sans-serif; background-color:=\r\n transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;2. Of these various possible Avataras, 1=\r\n0, or rather 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded special mention and sig=\r\nnificance across various Hindu spiritual literature, specially those which =\r\nwere composed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, =\r\nit was Kali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed the full effect of=\r\n Kali,once he left his body, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas were co=\r\nmposed after this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tant=\r\nras]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: =\r\nCourier New,courier,monaco,monospace,sans-serif; background-color: transpar=\r\nent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font=\r\n-size: 16px; font-family: Courier\n New,courier,monaco,monospace,sans-serif;=\r\n background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;3. These 10/9 Avataras=\r\n have a fixed sequence of appearance. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vam=\r\nana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Buddha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeab=\r\nle connection of the form and sequence of these main avatars with the evolu=\r\ntion of life on earth. From the aquatic, to the amphibian, to the land-anim=\r\nal, to the half-animal-half-man, to the dwarf man (first human life form wh=\r\no immediately takes possession of this earth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 step=\r\ns), to the Rajashik avatara of Parashurama moving around with an axe, to th=\r\ne Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to the Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this=\r\n indicates that spirituality is not to be separated into another world, but=\r\n is a progressive realization of the various manifestation and potentials t=\r\nhat lie inherent in the consciousness and its development through various l=\r\nife-forms. Larger\n spirituality of earth and evolution go hand in hand. Tha=\r\nt is Nature&#39;s grand design for life on earth.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb=\r\n(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: Courier New,courier,monaco,monospa=\r\nce,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16px; font-family: Courier =\r\nNew,courier,monaco,monospace,sans-serif; background-color: transparent; fon=\r\nt-style: normal;&quot;&gt;4. In this specifc context, I am only focusing on the par=\r\nable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that if one worshi=\r\nps say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of liberation of the =\r\nsoul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any Devata can l=\r\nead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the Avatars of Vi=\r\nshnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider super-massive s=\r\npiritual dynamos.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); font-size: 16=\r\npx; font-family:\n Courier New,courier,monaco,monospace,sans-serif; backgrou=\r\nnd-color: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;5. Of these, naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they rep=\r\nresent a stage of evolution, both inside as well as outside, which society =\r\ncan relate of much easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage =\r\nof most satwic mind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to=\r\n transform the animal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a cons=\r\ntructive force for a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Satt=\r\nwa Guna, there can be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is s=\r\ntatic in nature and will change only when circumstances force it to. As per=\r\n the Valmiki Ramayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in t=\r\nhe forest. He did have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, w=\r\nhich was dispelled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun=\r\n to Rama.\n At the end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispa=\r\nssionate manner, that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it was the Dh=\r\narma to do so, and to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma of =\r\nthat age when he lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic, an=\r\nd I bow humbly to the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things =\r\nas they are, as a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own=\r\n preferences to it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced=\r\n which culminated into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispass=\r\nionate leader, such that no personal consideration or emotions or passions =\r\ncan overturn the Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader mus=\r\nt be!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Krshna, OTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth.=\r\n I am not taking his&nbsp; supernatural feats into account. It is his singu=\r\nlar and constant detachment from situations, from people, from environment,=\r\n\n from circumstances that mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to=\r\n leave Vrindavana for Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents, his vil=\r\nlage-folks who so loved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense f=\r\nor him to leave the shelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village=\r\n life and head into an unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to rea=\r\nson with them, then he understood that they won&#39;t understand, he promised h=\r\ne will return back once his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Lat=\r\ner, much later, when the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in the=\r\nir dance, he obliged. But the moment some of them started getting jealous a=\r\nnd possessive of Krshna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying =\r\nthat he belongs to everyone equally and no one has any special right over h=\r\nim. When Shishupala abused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers o=\r\nn the floor, smiling and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was\n over, he=\r\n swiftly cut off Shishupala&#39;s head and was back into his poise. But when Bh=\r\nurishrava unfairly accused Krshna of being a revolutionist and charlatan, K=\r\nrshna did not kill him. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as ano=\r\nther black magician, wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa=\r\n in the assembly of kings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very =\r\nnext moment he was back into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabh=\r\narata is there one instance of his going overboard, never a single shade of=\r\n depression, equivocation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespecti=\r\nve of what others say or think of him. And then right in the middle of the =\r\ngreatest war he had the perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiri=\r\ntual philosophy. That is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga.=\r\n For a true Karma-Yogi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossibl=\r\ne. Neither the action nor the results belong to the\n instrument. When runni=\r\nng away from the battle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising B=\r\nheema to tear apart Jarashanda, or gesturing Bheema to hit Duryodhana below=\r\n the waist, or getting Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divi=\r\nne Intuition, knew exactly how the situations must be lined up which would =\r\ncause the destruction of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come b=\r\ny the rational thinking. But happens when one is constantly and consciously=\r\n connected to the Universal Force. We do not find these kind of complex sit=\r\nuations in the Rama Avatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, i=\r\nf we take the Adhbut Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling,=\r\n we get a different picture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed =\r\ndemon attacking Rama after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya S=\r\nhakti and demolishes the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we=\r\n take only the Ramayana and the Mahabharata,\n the picture that emerges is v=\r\nery clear. Rama is the embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays al=\r\nl the great characteristics of satwa, chief of which is self-control, as we=\r\nll as the occasional sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita wh=\r\nom, at least until Ravana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna c=\r\nreates a true saint, but can also cause some grief when the stability is sh=\r\naken. Krshna was gunatita. He had no attachment to anything in this world -=\r\n man, women, deva, danava, friend, enemy - and therefore he was never affec=\r\nted any trace of negative emotion. His Ananda never left him even in the mo=\r\nst trying situations.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;6. Buddha was great spiritual force in this wo=\r\nrld. But I do not see him fit in the scheme of evolutionary Avatars. His re=\r\nalization, the one he advocated, is a static realization, an end in a void.=\r\n This is clearly denying of the reality of this earth. I find this not in t=\r\nune with what either Rama or Krshna\n espoused. None of them negated this wo=\r\nrld. If negation of this world and life is the final aim, then why send so =\r\nmany avatars at crucial stages of evolutionary development? If the spiritua=\r\nl impact on masses is the reason for Buddha being an Avatara, then why not =\r\nJesus or Zorathrusta.? They are no less impactful in that sense. But do the=\r\ny fit in the scheme of spiritual line that these 9 Avataras of Narayana ind=\r\nicate in a most logical manner? No. As such many vaishnava traditions in pa=\r\nrts of India, do not consider Buddha to be an avatara. Realization, to be c=\r\nomplete and holistic, must be both static and dynamic, outside of life as w=\r\nell as inside of life. That is why the Tantras formed their own kind of spi=\r\nritual philosophy, of the world as body of Shakti and therefore an object o=\r\nf reverence and realization.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;7. The original literature of the Nath =\r\nYogis used to mention 9 chakras. These are centers of psychological functio=\r\nns. 6 inside the human body\n and 3 too subtle, or non-developed in most peo=\r\nple, even seekers. It is my belief that each of the 9 Avataras - excluding =\r\nBuddha - correspond to the full power and force of one of these 9 Chakras. =\r\nSimilarly, the 9 grahas, or that which can modify consciousness or allow th=\r\ne consciousness to explore and express itself is various possiblities, are =\r\n9 in number. The lagna is a reference point and not a graha. Therefore the =\r\nchief Avatars who represent the parable of evolution are nine in number. An=\r\nd the ninth of the sequence is yet to come.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;8. I cannot comment on w=\r\nhich graha would typically represent which Avatara. I know of what the BPHS=\r\n says, however, it is my belief - feel free to disagree with it -:)[one can=\r\nnot rule out some deep-rooted corruption of understanding or textual misrep=\r\nresentation in this Kali-Yuga] - that the Atmah among the Avataras has not =\r\nyet appeared. It will be Kalki, or as Vimalananda seems to say in the Aghor=\r\na books, Nishkalanka\n - the stainless one. There is only one thing which is=\r\n perfectly stainless, the Atmah .After a Nirguna/Gunatita awastha comes liv=\r\ning in the full and complete purity and might and force and strength of the=\r\n Atmah. By the sheer dint of his purity the last Avatara will burn away opp=\r\nosing forces of this world and fulfill the purpose of evolution. Even Krshn=\r\na used diplomacy at various points in his adult life to achieve his ends. K=\r\nalki, I am speculating, won&#39;t even need that. The white horse and that swor=\r\nd is a metaphor. He will be the only one capable enough to rectify the vari=\r\nous errors and corruptions that beset our age. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Well, this is how I =\r\nlook at the story of Avataras. It is perfectly ok not to agree with my view=\r\ns, but I am reasonably sanguine now that this is what is closer to truth.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;-Regards&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div cl=\r\nass=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size:16=\r\npx;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span\n class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color:rgb(153, 153, 153)=\r\n;&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimAp=\r\nannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_1342=\r\n43506227946 yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yui_3_7_2_26_1367656257054_73&quot; styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000=\r\n&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanutta=\r\nmam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: Courier New, courier, monaco, monospace, san=\r\ns-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new=\r\n york, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  =\r\n&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha P.V.R.

A learned friend wrote that &quot;Krshn=\r\na is the God-man&quot;, &quot;Previous Avatars are a build-up to this stage&quot; and &quot;Bud=\r\ndha after Krshna is like going back from the linear progression of spiritua=\r\nlity that the Avatars manifest one after the other upto Krshna&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;I want to emphatically disagree with this notion that Dasavatars of a &quot;l=\r\ninear progression of spirituality..upto Krshna&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n*&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Each avatara represents an aspect of Supreme in a perfected =\r\nform.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Maharshi Parasara equated dasavataras with planets. For =\r\nexample, Rama, Krishna and Narasimha are Sun, Moon and Mars, respectively.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;We also\n know that Sun, Moon, Mars, Mercury, Jupiter, Venus, S=\r\naturn, Rahu and Ketu are personifications of soul, mind, energy/initiative/=\r\ndrive, learning spirit, wisdom/discrimination, spirit of enjoyment/being ha=\r\nppy, patience/discipline, spirit of innovation/breaking barriers and detach=\r\nment (respectively).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Correspondingly, each avatara is an expre=\r\nssion of that aspect of Supreme in a perfected form. Each story is an examp=\r\nle of how that aspect operates.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Lord Rama&#39;s story is a perfect=\r\ned example of how soul operates. Lord Krishna&#39;s story is a perfected exampl=\r\ne of how mind operates. Lord Vamana&#39;s story is a perfected example of how w=\r\nisdom/discrimination operates. Lord Narasimha&#39;s story is a perfected exampl=\r\ne of how energy/drive/initiative operates.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;Now, let us remember one basic thing. Soul in us, mind in us, ener=\r\ngy in us,\n learning spirit in us, wisdom in us, happiness in us, discipline=\r\n/patience in us - all these are different manifestations of the same Self. =\r\nHowever, when Self manifests as these different aspects, it has different q=\r\nualities and plays different roles. There is no comparison between them.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;We MAY focus on one aspect of us first, perfect it and then perf=\r\nect other aspects through it. But, we need balance between all aspects in t=\r\nhe end. Similarly, these different aspects of Supreme Being are incomparabl=\r\ne and are in a balance working together in the Cosmos.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;One who is fascinated by the qualities of soul may lik=\r\ne the story that demonstrates how soul operates; one who is fascinated by t=\r\nhe qualities of mind may like the story that demonstrates how mind operates=\r\n, and one who is fascinated by the qualities of wisdom may like the story t=\r\nhat\n demonstrates how wisdom operates. And so on. But this is just a matter=\r\n of taste and subjective preference.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Let us focus on Rama and Krishna, i.e. soul and mind. Soul is seen as a =\r\nrepresentative of god in us, because of some basic attributes of it. It is =\r\nthe higher self and has no agendas, no likes or dislikes.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Once=\r\n mind fancies a separate existence with some agendas/desires, soul supports=\r\n the individualized consciousness stemming from that fancy and sees it as i=\r\nts dharma. It lends strength and support to EVERY aspect of this individual=\r\nized consciousness (e.g. mind, energy, intellect, learning ability, enjoyme=\r\nnt, discipline etc). It supports them fully and yet has no desires/agendas/=\r\nlikes/dislikes of its own! It impassionately witnesses and records all of o=\r\nne&#39;s agendas and karmas so that Laws of Nature give proper fruits later\n on=\r\n. It does all that despite full awareness that it is neither doing those ka=\r\nrmas nor receiving the fruits. As mind and other aspects of the individuali=\r\nzed consciousness entertain the notion that they are doing things and beget=\r\nting the fruits, soul supports them fully in this play. It sees that as its=\r\n dharma and does it impassionately.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Now, does this sound excit=\r\ning? Perhaps not to all. This functionality of an impassionate witness supp=\r\norting the play, may not seem interesting enough to some.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;On t=\r\nhe other hand, mind has likes, dislikes and agendas. It is constantly pursu=\r\ning those agendas, getting things and achieving things. Movement of mind is=\r\n what keeps the individualization going!!! Though soul is the support for e=\r\nverything else in the individualized consciousness, soul is a witness doing=\r\n its dharma impassionately. It is mind that keeps the individualization goi=\r\nng and brings in agendas and passion and even decides/affects\n every entity=\r\n&#39;s dharma. That way, mind is really the &quot;boss&quot; of the individualization. No=\r\n wonder Krishna&#39;s life appeals more to one who may be excited by this descr=\r\niption!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Lord Krishna is obviously =\r\nawe-inspiring, but let me put Rama&#39;s life in perspective.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Rama=\r\n&#39;s life demonstrates how soul operates. At a young age, he received Brahma =\r\nJnana from Vasishtha and became realized. Yet, he did whatever was his &quot;dha=\r\nrma&quot;. He helped Vishwamitra. Soon after marriage, he was given kingdom. At =\r\nthe last moment, his father banished him to forest at the behest of his ste=\r\np-mother and his step-brother was given the throne. He had no complaints. T=\r\nhough his father, step-mother and step-brother felt guilty to various degre=\r\nes, he himself supported and consoled all three and followed his dharma imp=\r\nassionately. Though he knew leaving Sita in the forest\n with Lakshmana and =\r\ngoing after the golden deer would cause problems, he did it impassionately =\r\nwhen Sita insisted. When she was kidnapped by Ravana, he searched for her a=\r\nnd fought the battle. He never faulted Sita for forcing him to leave her or=\r\n faulted Lakshmana for leaving her later. He accepted every life situation =\r\nwith no complaints and did the best possible action then. Even as he killed=\r\n Ravana, he did so without hatred or anger, but as his impassionate dharma.=\r\n Even as Ravana was dying, he went to him and respectfully learned some sub=\r\njects that were going to disappear with Ravana!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Rama is a perf=\r\nect example of a liberated man with no desires or agendas who impassionatel=\r\ny discharges one&#39;s dharma arising from the momentum of karmas before libera=\r\ntion. THAT is basically what soul does!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;br&gt;As another example, let us look at Lord\n Vaamana. His story is a perf=\r\nect demonstration of how wisdom/discrimination operates.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;He wa=\r\ns born as a learned pygmy. He filled the entire cosmos to rid earth of a ch=\r\naritable demon king with many great qualities.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Wisdom/discrimi=\r\nnation makes one humble and unassuming. When one is doing good work but tai=\r\nnted with demonic qualities (e.g. pride or attachment), one&#39;s discriminatio=\r\nn is not pleased until that pride is suppressed. When wisdom fills one&#39;s en=\r\ntire consciousness, then demonic qualities are completely suppressed.&lt;br&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Please think about the other avataras. =\r\nThe stories can be understood as perfect demonstrations of how various aspe=\r\ncts of our consciousness operate, based on clues from Maharshi Parasara.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Let us not compare Dasavataras, but celebrate each of them separ=\r\nately. Of course, if you are more\n attracted to one of them, please think a=\r\nbout that avatara more and develop devotion. They are ALL capable of reliev=\r\ning us from samsara.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;By the way, h=\r\nappy Hanumajjayanti to those who celebrate it today (there are different sc=\r\nhools of thought).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;A=\r\nstrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org &lt;br&gt;-=\r\n-------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---2020808392-1609910660-1367667282=:39346--\r\n\n"}}
