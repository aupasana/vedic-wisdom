Noticing this, a rich devotee, b=\r\ny name Kamala Rani,\nsent a soup made of costly vegetables and sweet grapes =\r\nto the Ashram one\nmorning, with a request that it might be served to Bhagav=\r\nan.\n\nAs it was received just as Bhagavan was about to take his food, Bhagav=\r\nan\naccepted it.\n\nNext day, she again prepared it in the same way and sent i=\r\nt to the Ashram.\nBut this time, looking at his attendants,Bhagavan said, =\r\n=93Why this daily?\nPlease tell her not to send it henceforth.=94\n\nThe lady,=\r\n however, sent it the following day too.\n\n=93There!=94 said Bhagavan, =93It=\r\n has come again. She will not stop sending it. I\nshould have said =91No=92 =\r\nat the very beginning. It was my mistake to have\naccepted it.=94\n\nA devotee=\r\n said, =93At present, Bhagavan is much run down.She is perhaps\nsending it b=\r\necause a liquid preparation with grapes might be good for\nBhagavan=92s heal=\r\nth.=94\n\n=93Oho!=94 Bhagavan exclaimed, =93Is that so? And have you authorit=\r\ny to plead on\nher behalf?=94\n\n=93That is not it, Bhagavan. I am saying so b=\r\necause I thought that such\npreparations might be good for the health.=94\n\n=\r\n=93May be so,=94 rejoined Bhagavan, =93but such things are for rich people,=\r\n not\nfor us.=94\n\n=93That devotee says that she herself will prepare it and =\r\nsend it,=94 persisted\nthe devotee.\n\n=93That is all right,=94 replied Bhagav=\r\nan, =93and if so, please find out if she\ncould supply the same thing for al=\r\nl the people who sit here.=94\n\n=93Our anxiety is that Bhagavan=92s body sho=\r\nuld be healthy.=94\n\n=93That is all right,=94 Bhagavan rejoined, =93but do y=\r\nou mean to say that health\ncould be maintained only if soup prepared from g=\r\nrapes and costly vegetables\nis taken? If it were so, then rich people shoul=\r\nd all be enjoying good\nhealth. Why is it then that they are more unhealthy =\r\nand sickly than the\nothers? The satisfaction that poor people get by taking=\r\n sour rice-gruel\ncannot be had from anything else. In olden days, when we w=\r\nere doing the\ncooking during summer, we used to have a pot into which we pu=\r\nt all the\ncooked rice left over, fill it up with water, a little buttermilk=\r\n,a little\nrice-gruel, dry ginger and lemon leaves, and set it aside. It wou=\r\nld get\nsour, cool and clear.\n\nThe liquid used to be drunk with a pinch of s=\r\nalt by all of us by the\ntumblerful,and we used to feel very happy. No one h=\r\nad any illness\nwhatsoever. Even now, if I were to drink two tumblerfuls of =\r\nsuch water, all\nmy ailments would disappear.\n\nBut then nobody prepares it f=\r\nor me. =91Aye! Aye! How could we give sour milk\ngruel to Swami?=92 they say=\r\n. What is to be done? To prepare soup of this sort\nwill cost a rupee. If, w=\r\nith that money, millet (ragi) were brought and\nground into flour, it would =\r\nlast for about a month for preparing gruel from\nit Grape juice, tomato soup=\r\n and the like are offered to me. Why do I require\nsuch things? Tell her not=\r\n to send the soup from tomorrow.=94\n\nThe thing stopped there. Bhagavan told=\r\n us several times that while he was\nliving on the hill he was eating bilva =\r\nfruit (a sort of wood-apple) for some\ndays and sustaining himself on it.\n\nB=\r\nhagavan does not like to eat any food without sharing it with the people\nar=\r\nound him.\n\nSource: Letters from Sri Ramanasramam VOLUMES I, II & Letters fr=\r\nom and\nRecollections of Sri Ramanasramam By SURI NAGAMMA Translated by D.
