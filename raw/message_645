On Kundalini Shakti and Shaktipat this parampara has been\none of the very=\r\n reputed ones. One of his books &quot;Chiti Leela&quot; is a very\ngood book that desc=\r\nribes the Kundalini Shakti and its working and the\nexperiances of different=\r\n chakra bedhans etc.\n\nVishnitirth Maharaj wrote also some sutras on kundali=\r\nni Shakti.\n\nEven Swami Muktanand Maharaj of Ganeshpuri did refer to Swami\nV=\r\nishnutirth maharaj&#39;s book and his guru Brahamchari Yoganand Maharaj.\nHis bo=\r\nok &quot;Chiti Leela&quot; is very good too. He was also a very authentic\nsaint.\n\nFro=\r\nm this same lineage there were also some masters in Maharastra\none Shri Gul=\r\nvani Maharaj who was also a disciple of Shri Vasudevanand\nSarawati -- the f=\r\namous master from Dattatreya lineage.\nGulvani Maharaj was a contemporary of=\r\n Vishnutirth Maharaj and he was\ninitiated into Shaktipat by Shri Loknath Ti=\r\nrth Maharaj. There is still\none direct disciple of Shri Loknath Tirth Mahar=\r\naj going by name of\nshri Kaka.\n \nThese lineages are originally from Kashmir=\r\n Shaivism.\nI believe one Saint Laksman Joo from kashmir has written a coupl=\r\ne of\nbooks on Kunadlini Shakti too. These are also good books too.\n\nMother =\r\nLal or Devi Laleshwari the very famous devi from kashmir was\nalso from the =\r\nsame lineage as Shri Vishnutirth Maharaj, although she\nhappened many centur=\r\nies ago.\n\nApart from above I believe the Nath Sampradaya also is very adept=\r\n in\nKundalini Awakening. I donot have any information of present saints in\n=\r\nthis lineage.\n\nSome of the books by Swami Shivom Tirth Maharaj are availabl=\r\ne on\nAmazon.com. (in engish too) here in US in India there are many ashrams=\r\n\nwhere one can get these books. Same with Swami Muktanand Maharaj&#39;s\nbooks t=\r\noo.\n\nIn short after one makes lots of effort like hath yoga or mantra yoga\n=\r\nor even homans or kriya yoga, there is a chance that kundalini shakti\ncan a=\r\nwaken or\nthe other way is by the grace of guru when he initiates a disciple=\r\n.\nThe above saints initiated their disciples and awakened kundalini.\n\nParam=\r\nhans Ramakrishna had that capability too and he had awakened\nkundalini shak=\r\nti of Swami Vivekanand and other disciples of him.\nRaman Maharshi also had =\r\nsimilar capabilities too.\n\nI am sure there are many other saints who are ve=\r\nry adapt in it.\n\nHope this information helps.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n\n--- In=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;kumar_gh_2000&quot;\n&lt;kumar_gh_2000@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Dear Miteshji,\n&gt; \n&gt; Where can I get the information regarding those 3 sa=\r\nints?

Sri Yogeshwar was a very \n&gt; highly\n&gt; &gt; realized s=\r\naint. His book is very good. He does mention about his\n&gt; &gt; prevoius birth a=\r\nnd also mentions that Saccha Baba had also confirmed\n&gt; &gt; the same thing. Sa=\r\nccha Baba was another very highly realized saint \n&gt; too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri Yoges=\r\nhwar had many times visions of Sai Baba of shirdi and \n&gt; Naamdev\n&gt; &gt; and al=\r\nso many other saints too. The initiation he got on the bank of\n&gt; &gt; river Na=\r\nrmada awakened his kundalini and he has described very\n&gt; &gt; accurately the s=\r\ntate and symptoms after awekaning of kunalini. He \n&gt; had\n&gt; &gt; very good comm=\r\nand on all aspects of sprituality and was a fantastic\n&gt; &gt; orator.

This inner guru is the same in all humam beings \n&gt; =\r\nbut\n&gt; &gt; manifests uniquely based on each person. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I also believe t=\r\nhat one needs to get initiated by a Guru who is\n&gt; &gt; present in physical for=\r\nm and seek guidance from him time to time.\n&gt; &gt; There are many instances of =\r\nother forms of inititations like\n&gt; &gt; initiation in dream or inititation by =\r\ncosmic forms, these forms of\n&gt; &gt; initiations though very important are very=\r\n rare or uncommon.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; After reading Sri Yogeshwar&#39;s book I had s=\r\nome questions pop up in my\n&gt; &gt; mind about him.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) What was the pur=\r\npose of his birth? Yes he may have guided many\n&gt; &gt; spiritual aspirants, but=\r\n there has to be something more unique.\n&gt; &gt; 2) Did he realize the ultimate?=\r\n i.e. he keeps mentioning in the book\n&gt; &gt; about it in many places? Was he s=\r\natisfied? How did he feel after \n&gt; that?\n&gt; &gt; 3) He did pass away abruptly i=\r\nn bombay while in the middle of giving\n&gt; &gt; spirtual talks? It seems unusual=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have also read somewhere that once a person reaches a spiritua=\r\nl\n&gt; &gt; state, he cannot remain in human body for more than few days, was \n&gt; =\r\nthis\n&gt; &gt; the case?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; May be others who have read this book can share=\r\n more light.\n&gt; &gt; I do recommend to seekers of spirutuality to read this boo=\r\nk if one \n&gt; has\n&gt; &gt; time, it is available for free to download as a pdf boo=\r\nk on his web \n&gt; site.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sri Ram Sharma also has done a lot of work f=\r\nor the betterment and\n&gt; &gt; upliftment, a lot of his information is wellknown=\r\n.

There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to Post\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of=\r\nfice and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Telep=\r\nhone\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. \n=\r\n&gt; Patel)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was =\r\nalways talking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; about\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. =\r\nThere was a weekly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He=\r\n was singing devotional songs \n&gt; created \n&gt; &gt; &gt; by\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weep=\r\ning while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 1=\r\n2 youngsters were attending this weekly \n&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday =\r\nevening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of \n&gt; 30\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then. We w=\r\nere used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty \n&gt; hours\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and we=\r\nre talking only about Thakur.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One day when we were at sea shore h=\r\ne suddenly told me--\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some guest have come=\r\n to my home and my wife is remembering me. \n&gt; My \n&gt; &gt; &gt; son\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will co=\r\nme in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go \n&gt; now=E2=80=9D. -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be a plane \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncrash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed \n&gt;=\r\n about \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He could foresee the events. One day I had to go=\r\n to Dwarka by \n&gt; Bus, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as b=\r\nus tire will be punctured. \n&gt; Yet I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus station but bus did=\r\n not come from Dwarka as was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; punctured\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. This was =\r\nsurprising.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had som=\r\ne super \n&gt; &gt; &gt; power\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only=\r\n. I was attracted \n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. One day I thought, I should al=\r\nso be disciple of \n&gt; shri\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974.=\r\n At 7 pm I surrendered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; myself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=\r\n=99s house before Thakur picture. I \n&gt; prayed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deeply fro=\r\nm my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; grace. \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 \n&gt; morning=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; waking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that=\r\n I have\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was anno=\r\nyed \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; she\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy sho=\r\nuld you take such a hasty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; decision?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa wa=\r\ns a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta.

I thought-- yes I have \n&gt; taken\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But =\r\nI remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was \n&gt; telling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\neir disciples to test him before accepting him. I also \n&gt; decided to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =E2=80&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. \n&gt; =\r\nPatel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen him=\r\n.
