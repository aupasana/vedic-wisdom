But imho it i=\r\ns always better to accumulate more blessings than curses for starters like =\r\nme.  So practically there is difference\n\nInterestingly, Doing karmas with a=\r\n greed of blessings in mind itself is a curse. :)\n\nI will like to add that =\r\nthese blessings and curses can come from non living things, living beings, =\r\ndeities and many other beings which exist in nature. \n\nWith the grace of lo=\r\nrd Krishna. \n\nRegards\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dr. A.
