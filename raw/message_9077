I have no idea how long one needs=\r\n to do it. It depends on how big the pile is and how big one&#39;s shovel is. I=\r\nn other words, the heaviness of the karmas blocking one and the intensity o=\r\nf the remedial measures decide when one breaks through. It may be a day or =\r\na decade or whatever.\n \nFor material concerns related to finances, usually =\r\nworship of Ganapathi or Lakshmi is recommended. Homam of Lakshmi with Kanak=\r\na Dhara Sotram (composed by Adi Shankara) is a good option, but I was asked=\r\n by my guru not to include it in Mahalakshmi homam manual as one of the opt=\r\nions. But one can download the stotram from the web and use it. One needs t=\r\no just add swaahaa at the end of each verse and make offerings.\n \nThere are=\r\n billions of really really suffering human beings (and many many more other=\r\n beings) on this earth. When I read news sometimes, my heart gets wrenched.=\r\n But, unfortunately, there is nothing I can do, except praying to Her to gi=\r\nve conviction and direction to those suffering, so that they can eventually=\r\n find their way out of their misery.\n \nI hope some divine force will show y=\r\nou the right direction. Doing some sadhana sincerely for a while is a great=\r\n thing in this age. I hope some benefit accrues.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n=\r\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\n--------\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamn=\r\nadas@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Narasimha Ji,\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Do you have no advice?
