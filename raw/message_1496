Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whatever is one&#39;s path, Kundalini is not only aw=\r\nakened but goes to Sahasrara \n&gt; &gt; when one is established in undifferentiat=\r\ned Self. Even if one does not think \n&gt; &gt; in those terms, it still happens. =\r\nIt is incorrect to say that one can \n&gt; &gt; realize the highest truths without=\r\n Kundalini awakened. A more accurate \n&gt; &gt; statement would be that one can r=\r\nealize the highest truths without engaging \n&gt; &gt; in any specific practices g=\r\neared at awakening or raising Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Some people following the=\r\n so-called &quot;Kundalini yoga&quot; or other raja/hatha \n&gt; &gt; yoga paths specificall=\r\ny try to awaken Kundalini. However, such practices are \n&gt; &gt; not at all need=\r\ned for awakening Kundalini. People belonging to various \n&gt; &gt; traditions and=\r\n paths, not just limited to Hinduism, can experience Kundalini \n&gt; &gt; awakeni=\r\nng, without knowing anything about the name or the symbolism. There \n&gt; &gt; ar=\r\ne a lot of misconceptions about Kundalini.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini is essentially the force of one&#39;s self-awareness. Awakened =\r\nand \n&gt; &gt; raised kundalini implies a more refined and higher self-awareness.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; At the lowest level, we bind our selves to specific bodies and ou=\r\nr \n&gt; &gt; self-awareness is limited to a body, a name and other things associa=\r\nted with \n&gt; &gt; the body and name. This experience of self as a body correspo=\r\nnds to \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini sleeping at Mooladhara. At the highest level, we are =\r\nthe \n&gt; &gt; undifferentiated Self, known as Brahman, that is all-pervading. Th=\r\nis \n&gt; &gt; &#39;experience&#39; of self corresponds to Kundalini at Sahasrara. As \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n self-awareness goes from the former to the latter, it may traverse through=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; many stages in between. Correspondingly, many experiences are possibl=\r\ne.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini rises as high as it can =\r\nwhen it awakens for the first time, like a \n&gt; &gt; spring suppressed for a lon=\r\ng time. However, it comes down again and the \n&gt; &gt; process of rise from then=\r\n onwards will be slower, Kundalini will work its \n&gt; &gt; way up while the nadi=\r\ns are continuously cleaned (i.e. undesirable \n&gt; &gt; conditioning of mind is c=\r\nleaned). When Kundalini rises high at the time of \n&gt; &gt; awakening, it may en=\r\ncounter impurities in nadis and yet rise high through \n&gt; &gt; the impurities. =\r\nThis may manifest physically as a powerful experience \n&gt; &gt; similar to heavy=\r\n electricity flowing in the back.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are thousands of nadis in =\r\nthe sookshma sareera. The exact path taken \n&gt; &gt; by Kundalini as it rises fo=\r\nr the first time is not fixed. It may change from \n&gt; &gt; person to person, ba=\r\nsed on the impurities in various nadis. The exact \n&gt; &gt; &quot;experience&quot; will va=\r\nry depending on the path traversed and the final point \n&gt; &gt; reached by self=\r\n-awareness (kundalini), before withdrawal.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I actually know one per=\r\nson who had kundalini awakening, rise to Sahasrara \n&gt; &gt; and samadhi for 7 d=\r\nays, all happening at the same time. His nadis had \n&gt; &gt; already been purifi=\r\ned. Once kundalini awakened, he directly went into \n&gt; &gt; samadhi, stayed the=\r\nre for 7 days and came back as a fully realized person. \n&gt; &gt; But it is a mu=\r\nch longer journey for most.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Saying &quot;this is what happens in a Kund=\r\nalini awakening&quot; is difficult. The \n&gt; &gt; exact experience changes from perso=\r\nn to person, depending on the path \n&gt; &gt; traversed the final point reached b=\r\ny Kundalini. However, I can say one thing \n&gt; &gt; confidently: Once Kundalini =\r\ntruly awakens and rises, one will not have any \n&gt; &gt; confusion about what ha=\r\nppened. But, until kundalini awakening occurs, one \n&gt; &gt; may confuse various=\r\n other experiences (such as some movement of vayu in \n&gt; &gt; various nadis) fo=\r\nr kundalini movement and wrongly think that kundalini is \n&gt; &gt; awakened.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Sensation like ants or worms crawling al=\r\nong the spine or in the head are NOT \n&gt; &gt; due to kundalini awakening or ris=\r\ne. That can be due to a little vaayu \n&gt; &gt; flowing in various nadis. This ca=\r\nn be a premonitory sign (but not a \n&gt; &gt; guarantee) of kundalini awakening. =\r\nSame thing can be said about the \n&gt; &gt; sensation of tilting  to one side (ba=\r\nck or left or right) or the sensation \n&gt; &gt; of having completely fallen back=\r\n (even though one is sitting normally in \n&gt; &gt; reality). There are several s=\r\nuch premonitory signs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As a reference=\r\n, I can narrate the experience of ONE person. He was \n&gt; &gt; meditating with a=\r\n Veda mantra everyday. His guru had told him a few months \n&gt; &gt; earlier that=\r\n his time for Kundalini awakening had come. However, he had \n&gt; &gt; absolutely=\r\n no idea what kundalini was and was totally uninformed about \n&gt; &gt; nadis, ch=\r\nakras and kundalini. He did not engage in any specific raja/hatha \n&gt; &gt; yoga=\r\n practices. All he did was to sit with his back erect and eyes closed \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nand meditate with a veda mantra. In the weeks before kundalini awakening, h=\r\ne \n&gt; &gt; started experiencing various premonitory signs. He guru told him not=\r\n to be \n&gt; &gt; distracted by them and to keep the focus on the mantra and try =\r\nto forget \n&gt; &gt; everything else. When mind starts dwelling on an experience,=\r\n it gets stuck \n&gt; &gt; there and cannot go higher.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When he was medita=\r\nting oneday, his mind was perfectly and intensely focused \n&gt; &gt; on the mantr=\r\na and other thoughts ceased momentarily. Suddenly he became \n&gt; &gt; aware of h=\r\nis body. It felt like there was a really tremendous explosion at \n&gt; &gt; the b=\r\nase of his spine. Then it felt like a huge amount of electric current \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwas going up his spine from the base. Then it felt like he was not a body \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; but a small point. Then it felt like he was going up like a rocket at a=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; tremendous speed. Then it felt like there was a tremendously bright w=\r\nhite \n&gt; &gt; light and there was nothing else. It felt like he was not a small=\r\n point in \n&gt; &gt; that light, but he was the light itself. There was an undesc=\r\nribable sense of \n&gt; &gt; peace and happiness. Suddenly, from nowhere, a though=\r\nt came &quot;what is this? \n&gt; &gt; What happened to my body? I have responsibilitie=\r\ns still.&quot; Then he became \n&gt; &gt; aware of himself as a body sitting in pooja r=\r\noom. When he left pooja room \n&gt; &gt; and went out, he felt great love for ever=\r\nyone and happiness. For example, a \n&gt; &gt; serial was coming on TV and charact=\r\ners in the serial that he normally \n&gt; &gt; disliked for their shallow personal=\r\nities suddenly felt like real people and \n&gt; &gt; he had great love and compass=\r\nion for those TV serial characters (and other \n&gt; &gt; real people too). That s=\r\ntate of love and compassion lasted a while and then \n&gt; &gt; he was normal.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; This short experience was only the beginning of a journey. He experie=\r\nnced \n&gt; &gt; many things later on. These experiences were different from each =\r\nother. As I \n&gt; &gt; said earlier, the experience varies based on the path trav=\r\nersed and the \n&gt; &gt; point reached by the self-awareness (kundalini). On vari=\r\nous occasions, \n&gt; &gt; kundalini rose and he saw several sights and several be=\r\nings within and heard \n&gt; &gt; several sounds, including veda mantras and beeja=\r\naksharas, again within.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; He realized the transientness of a lot tha=\r\nt we cling on to and the existence \n&gt; &gt; of something far higher and more pe=\r\nrmanent.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; All this slowly started to change his attitude. His sense=\r\ns turned inwards \n&gt; &gt; and he critically started to analyze his own thoughts=\r\n and motives and worked \n&gt; &gt; on correcting his attitude. The impact of what=\r\n was happening around him, \n&gt; &gt; what others did and said started to make le=\r\nsser and lesser impact on him. \n&gt; &gt; Luckily, he had a guru who put things i=\r\nn perspective and said that kundalini \n&gt; &gt; awakening was just a beginning a=\r\nnd the real work was ahead. Depending on \n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s readiness, that real wo=\r\nrk can take many many years or even lives.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Kundalini awakening is only a beginning. It is not an end. Even the r=\r\nise of \n&gt; &gt; kundalini to a chakra is not an end. In fact, a big percentage =\r\nof people \n&gt; &gt; with awakened kundalini end up getting stuck at mooladhara i=\r\ntself. Very few \n&gt; &gt; make it to the next chakra or the one after, but end u=\r\np getting stuck there. \n&gt; &gt; Very very few make it to higher chakras. And a =\r\nvery small minority actually \n&gt; &gt; realise self.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Complete overcomin=\r\ng of ego and sthita prajnataa described by Sri Krishna in \n&gt; &gt; BhagavadGita=\r\n is the only real end goal of sadhana, whether you are into raja \n&gt; &gt; yoga =\r\nor karma yoga or bhakti yoga or jnaana yoga. Thinking of a mystical \n&gt; &gt; ex=\r\nperience can only distract one from this goal. I urge sadhakas, especially =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; those who respect my advice, to forget about kundalini and chakras and=\r\n just \n&gt; &gt; keep doing homam and japam (or whatever path they have chosen), =\r\nkeep \n&gt; &gt; purifying themselves with sadhana, keep working on their attitude=\r\n and \n&gt; &gt; thought process and keep improving self-control. When (or as) min=\r\nd becomes \n&gt; &gt; purified and one overcomes ego, whatever needs to happen wit=\r\nh kundalini WILL \n&gt; &gt; happen automatically. Thinking of things in terms of =\r\nkundalini and mystical \n&gt; &gt; experiences is a big deterrent rather than a bo=\r\nost, in one&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; &gt; sadhana. Instead of trying to manipulate kunda=\r\nlini, try to manipulate the \n&gt; &gt; way your mind works and perfect your self-=\r\ncontrol. Kundalini will \n&gt; &gt; automatically follow. One will do well to reme=\r\nmber these words.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------=\r\n--------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam You=\r\nrself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.=\r\norg\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pat=\r\nhak@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, March 08, 20=\r\n09 3:30 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Urdhwa-Retas\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namas=\r\nte,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Relevant to this on going subject, i remember reading autobiog=\r\nraphy of Shri \n&gt; &gt; Yogeshwarji (Prakah na Panthe) in which he had mentioned=\r\n that Kundalini \n&gt; &gt; Awakening is not mandatory for realization.

When one attains a perfect focus on a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantr=\r\na and distracting thoughts cease, praana moves downward from \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; lungs=\r\n/stomach and apaana moves upward. After praana and apaana combine, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n they can move upward at a rapid speed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When praana and=\r\n apaana combine for the first time, it may feel like an \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explosion =\r\nwithin one. As praana moves up, it will feel like one is freed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fro=\r\nm the body and one does not exist. This is similar to death, except \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; that there is fear and confusion at death and one may feel a kind of \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; bliss when this happens during meditation. However, if one&#39;s focus on =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra relaxes and one become &quot;aware of&quot; the experience and starts=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; analyzing it with the rational mind, there is a chance of one bec=\r\noming \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worried and confused.

In=\r\n fact, thinking about them, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desiring them and doing specific pract=\r\nices may become an obstacle and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; delay things.

How can i \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; again experience the Beloved.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That then is the experience of=\r\n mantra when it is done correctly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s personality is=\r\n effaced such that the deity&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personality sits there then the sad=\r\nhak experiences himself as that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There then=\r\n arises no difference in the sadhak or the deity commanding a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cert=\r\nain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; w=\r\nhich appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality is crucial. Ugra \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n devatas make the person care almost for nothing himself, so self \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nidentification is minimised and the person&#39;s spiritual evolution \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nontinues.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C2 very little=C2 according to me whic=\r\nh is black magic. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. If your Shakti and de=\r\nity is a higher shakti \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such as Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, =\r\nChinnamasta, then your power \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be that of God himself( Provided=\r\n you have Vijnana). After the death \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of the body, such a sadhaka jo=\r\nins the realm of the deity or if he was \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; originally a Nath or a Mun=\r\ni goes to a separate realm reserved for these \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; beings.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Atta=\r\ncking such a sadhak brings the full bearing of karma onto the heads \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; of the attackers and some people may realise this to their detriment( \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Patan comes from Jalandhar Nath burying the city of Patan with his \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Shakti causing an earthquake). Some people may even equate this with=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. Here there is only action and reaction.(Bit like you=\r\n attack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a normal person, and you will get a result of this from th=\r\nat same Atma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; whom you harmed maybe 5 to 10 lifetimes later. But if=\r\n you attack \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; somebody who is identifying with the universe and has =\r\nvery few karmas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; left, then the Universe itself attacks you, becaus=\r\ne your attack is not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the sadhaka, but on his identification, ie=\r\n God or the universe).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If people persist in using the Shakti posses=\r\ned by a small Pisacha, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bhuta, then there is only a little Shakti w=\r\nhich can be used, moreover=C2 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then their minds and intellects will=\r\n not be free of identification with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the body and so their actions =\r\nare those which are generally termed as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; black magic. These people =\r\nusually join the same spirits which they have \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; been using after dea=\r\nth, this is not an enjoyable experience.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Imagine if somebody is wor=\r\nshipping Chandika for a few lifetimes, then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; even in this birth he =\r\nor she is drawn to that deity and such a sadhak \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may acheive after =\r\na few repitions of a mantra(because of his previous \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; effort).\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; On the other hand somebody doing this mantra only in this lifetime may \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feel that the 64 things which bind every mantra are crucial and may=\r\n not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; acheive in this lifetime.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; According to me the proof o=\r\nf the pudding is in the eating, so let me \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suggest an easy sadhana.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If one is so inclined, then starting on some good day, do 1000 \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; reititions of the Savitri(some=C2 call this the=C2 Gayatri, but the r=\r\neal \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Gayatri is hidden) every day, main constraints\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same ti=\r\nme every day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same place.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same materials.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Same dire=\r\nction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As little movement as one can.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Count on rudraksha or=\r\n Tulsi as is your inclination.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Complete restraint on sex(from the m=\r\nind and the body, not just the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; body), reduce food intake, grow a b=\r\neard.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do not eat 2 hrs before you start, make sure your bowels are =\r\nempty \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; before you start.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Continue this for 100 days and do =\r\nthis whole procedure 3 times.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; See the difference in your personalit=\r\ny before and after.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Long and short , what is important is that life=\r\n may be short, so do some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana, and persist with that sadhana f=\r\nor as long as is physically \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this clarifie=\r\ns some of the concepts which were being discussed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kind=\r\n Love and Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; manish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; You may post this on the list as a=\r\n clarification from me if you feel \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that this is suitable.\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00BD_01C9A10A.B2A914A0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3492&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;My dear=\r\n Utpal and others,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FO=\r\nNT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt; Even his compulsive critic =\r\nwould think before \nmaking any comments&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl size=3D2&gt;&gt; after reading this.

Even if =\r\none does not think &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in those terms, \nit still happens. It is i=\r\nncorrect to say that one can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; realize the \nhighest truths with=\r\nout Kundalini awakened. A more accurate &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nstatement would be t=\r\nhat one can realize the highest truths without engaging \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; in a=\r\nny specific practices geared at awakening or raising \nKundalini.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Some people following the so-called \n&quot;Kundalini yoga&quot; or o=\r\nther raja/hatha &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; yoga paths specifically try \nto awaken Kundal=\r\nini. However, such practices are &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; not at all needed \nfor awake=\r\nning Kundalini. People belonging to various &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; traditions \nand p=\r\naths, not just limited to Hinduism, can experience Kundalini &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n\nawakening, without knowing anything about the name or the symbolism. There=\r\n \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; are a lot of misconceptions about Kundalini.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nKundalini is esse=\r\nntially the force of one&#39;s self-awareness. Awakened and \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rais=\r\ned kundalini implies a more refined and higher \nself-awareness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; At the lowest level, we bind our \nselves to specific bodies=\r\n and our &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; self-awareness is limited to a \nbody, a name and oth=\r\ner things associated with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the body and name. \nThis experience=\r\n of self as a body corresponds to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Kundalini \nsleeping at Mool=\r\nadhara. At the highest level, we are the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nundifferentiated Se=\r\nlf, known as Brahman, that is all-pervading. This &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &#39;experienc=\r\ne&#39; of self corresponds to Kundalini at Sahasrara. As &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; self-aw=\r\nareness goes from the former to the latter, it may traverse through \n&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; many stages in between. Correspondingly, many experiences are \nposs=\r\nible.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n \nKundalini rises as high as it can when it awakens for the first time, lik=\r\ne a \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; spring suppressed for a long time. However, it comes dow=\r\nn again \nand the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; process of rise from then onwards will be sl=\r\nower, \nKundalini will work its &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; way up while the nadis are con=\r\ntinuously \ncleaned (i.e. undesirable &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; conditioning of mind is =\r\ncleaned). When \nKundalini rises high at the time of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; awakening=\r\n, it may encounter \nimpurities in nadis and yet rise high through &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; the impurities. This \nmay manifest physically as a powerful experience=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; similar to heavy \nelectricity flowing in the back.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There are thousands \nof nadis in the sookshma sareera. Th=\r\ne exact path taken &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; by \nKundalini as it rises for the first ti=\r\nme is not fixed. It may change from \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; person to person, based =\r\non the impurities in various nadis. The \nexact &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &quot;experience&quot; w=\r\nill vary depending on the path traversed and \nthe final point &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n reached by self-awareness (kundalini), before \nwithdrawal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; I actually know one person who had \nkundalini awakening, rise t=\r\no Sahasrara &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and samadhi for 7 days, all \nhappening at the sam=\r\ne time. His nadis had &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; already been purified. \nOnce kundalini =\r\nawakened, he directly went into &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; samadhi, stayed \nthere for 7 =\r\ndays and came back as a fully realized person. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But it \nis a m=\r\nuch longer journey for most.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Saying &quot;this is \nwh=\r\nat happens in a Kundalini awakening&quot; is difficult. The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; exact =\r\n\nexperience changes from person to person, depending on the path &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; \ntraversed the final point reached by Kundalini. However, I can say one=\r\n thing \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; confidently: Once Kundalini truly awakens and rises, =\r\none will not \nhave any &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; confusion about what happened. But, un=\r\ntil kundalini \nawakening occurs, one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; may confuse various othe=\r\nr experiences (such \nas some movement of vayu in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; various nadi=\r\ns) for kundalini movement \nand wrongly think that kundalini is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; awakened.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; \nSensation like ants or worms crawling along the spine or in the he=\r\nad are NOT \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; due to kundalini awakening or rise. That can be d=\r\nue to a little \nvaayu &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; flowing in various nadis. This can be a=\r\n premonitory sign \n(but not a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; guarantee) of kundalini awakeni=\r\nng. Same thing can be \nsaid about the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sensation of tilting&nb=\r\nsp; to one side (back or \nleft or right) or the sensation &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of =\r\nhaving completely fallen back \n(even though one is sitting normally in &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; reality). There are \nseveral such premonitory signs.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; As a \nreference,=\r\n I can narrate the experience of ONE person. He was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nmeditati=\r\nng with a Veda mantra everyday. His guru had told him a few months \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; earlier that his time for Kundalini awakening had come. However, \nhe=\r\n had &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; absolutely no idea what kundalini was and was totally \nu=\r\nninformed about &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; nadis, chakras and kundalini. He did not enga=\r\nge \nin any specific raja/hatha &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; yoga practices. All he did was=\r\n to sit \nwith his back erect and eyes closed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and meditate wit=\r\nh a veda \nmantra. In the weeks before kundalini awakening, he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n started \nexperiencing various premonitory signs. He guru told him not to b=\r\ne &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \ndistracted by them and to keep the focus on the mantra and=\r\n try to forget \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; everything else. When mind starts dwelling on=\r\n an experience, it \ngets stuck &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; there and cannot go higher.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nWhen he was meditating oneday, his mind was perfe=\r\nctly and intensely focused \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on the mantra and other thoughts =\r\nceased momentarily. Suddenly he \nbecame &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; aware of his body. It=\r\n felt like there was a really \ntremendous explosion at &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the ba=\r\nse of his spine. Then it felt like a \nhuge amount of electric current &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; was going up his spine from the \nbase. Then it felt like he was no=\r\nt a body &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; but a small point. Then \nit felt like he was going u=\r\np like a rocket at a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; tremendous speed. \nThen it felt like the=\r\nre was a tremendously bright white &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; light and \nthere was nothi=\r\nng else. It felt like he was not a small point in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nthat light=\r\n, but he was the light itself. There was an undescribable sense of \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; peace and happiness. Suddenly, from nowhere, a thought came &quot;what \ni=\r\ns this? &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; What happened to my body? I have responsibilities sti=\r\nll.&quot; \nThen he became &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; aware of himself as a body sitting in po=\r\noja room. \nWhen he left pooja room &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and went out, he felt grea=\r\nt love for \neveryone and happiness. For example, a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; serial was=\r\n coming on TV and \ncharacters in the serial that he normally &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\ndisliked for their \nshallow personalities suddenly felt like real people an=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; he had \ngreat love and compassion for those TV serial chara=\r\ncters (and other &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; real people too). That state of love and co=\r\nmpassion lasted a while and then \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; he was normal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; This short experience \nwas only the beginning of a journey. =\r\nHe experienced &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; many things \nlater on. These experiences were =\r\ndifferent from each other. As I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nsaid earlier, the experience=\r\n varies based on the path traversed and the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; point reached by=\r\n the self-awareness (kundalini). On various occasions, \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; kunda=\r\nlini rose and he saw several sights and several beings within \nand heard &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; several sounds, including veda mantras and \nbeejaaksharas, agai=\r\nn within.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; He realized the \ntransientness of a lo=\r\nt that we cling on to and the existence &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of \nsomething far hig=\r\nher and more permanent.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; All this \nslowly started=\r\n to change his attitude. His senses turned inwards &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nand he cr=\r\nitically started to analyze his own thoughts and motives and worked \n&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; on correcting his attitude. The impact of what was happening \naroun=\r\nd him, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; what others did and said started to make lesser and \nl=\r\nesser impact on him. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Luckily, he had a guru who put things in=\r\n \nperspective and said that kundalini &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; awakening was just a be=\r\nginning \nand the real work was ahead. Depending on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; one&#39;s read=\r\niness, that \nreal work can take many many years or even lives.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nKundalini awake=\r\nning is only a beginning. It is not an end. Even the rise of \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n kundalini to a chakra is not an end. In fact, a big percentage of \npeople =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; with awakened kundalini end up getting stuck at mooladhara \ni=\r\ntself. Very few &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; make it to the next chakra or the one after, =\r\nbut \nend up getting stuck there. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Very very few make it to hig=\r\nher \nchakras. And a very small minority actually &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; realise self=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Complete overcoming of ego and sthita prajnat=\r\naa described by \nSri Krishna in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; BhagavadGita is the only real=\r\n end goal of sadhana, \nwhether you are into raja &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; yoga or karm=\r\na yoga or bhakti yoga or \njnaana yoga. Thinking of a mystical &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n experience can only distract \none from this goal. I urge sadhakas, especia=\r\nlly &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; those who respect \nmy advice, to forget about kundalini a=\r\nnd chakras and just &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; keep \ndoing homam and japam (or whatever =\r\npath they have chosen), keep &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \npurifying themselves with sadha=\r\nna, keep working on their attitude and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; thought process and k=\r\neep improving self-control. When (or as) mind becomes \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; purifi=\r\ned and one overcomes ego, whatever needs to happen with \nkundalini WILL &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; happen automatically. Thinking of things in terms \nof kundalini =\r\nand mystical &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; experiences is a big deterrent rather \nthan a bo=\r\nost, in one&#39;s spiritual &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana. Instead of trying to \nmanipu=\r\nlate kundalini, try to manipulate the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; way your mind works \nan=\r\nd perfect your self-control. Kundalini will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; automatically \nfo=\r\nllow. One will do well to remember these words.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n\nBest regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n-----------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \nDo a Short Homam =\r\nYourself: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A \nhre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n/tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; \n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comc=\r\nast.net&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Free Jyotish =\r\nsoftware (Windows): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;=\r\nA \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot;&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nFrom: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; \n&lt;vedic_pathak@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;&lt;A \nhref=\r\n=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt;&g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; Sent: Sunday, March 08, 2009 3:30 PM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] \nRe: Urdhwa-Retas&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nNamaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Relevant to this on going subject, i r=\r\nemember reading \nautobiography of Shri &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Yogeshwarji (Prakah na=\r\n Panthe) in which he \nhad mentioned that Kundalini &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Awakening =\r\nis not mandatory for \nrealization.

After praana and apaana combine, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; they can move upward at a rapid speed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; \n=C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When praana and apaana combine for the first=\r\n time, it \nmay feel like an &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; explosion within one. A=\r\ns praana moves \nup, it will feel like one is freed &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nfrom the body and one \ndoes not exist. This is similar to death, except &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that \nthere is fear and confusion at death and one may=\r\n feel a kind of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; bliss when this happens during med=\r\nitation. However, if one&#39;s focus on \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra relaxes=\r\n and one become &quot;aware of&quot; the experience \nand starts &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; analyzing it with the rational mind, there is \na chance of one becoming =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worried and confused. So one \nshould sustain the st=\r\nate where there is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; full focus on \nmantra and no oth=\r\ner distractions, for as long as possible.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; These things happen automatically without thinking \nabout=\r\n them and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; engaging in any specific practicies.

If you surrender to a deity and do a mantra with a high &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; level of focus, that is enough. Do NOT run after any exper=\r\nience and \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; think of an experience as an end result.=\r\n The focus \nshould be mantra and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantra alone.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Even when an experience occu=\r\nrs, I tell people to \nnot be tied to it and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not thi=\r\nnk too much about \nit.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Su=\r\nchaka dream is a vision of \nsomething that is going to happen.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- ---------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Y=\r\nourself: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.o=\r\nrg/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups&quot;&gt;http://groups&lt;/A&gt;. \ny=\r\nahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons \n=\r\n(MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro&lt;/A&gt;. home.comcast. \n=\r\nnet&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&g=\r\nt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagan&quot;&gt;htt=\r\np://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; ------------ --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; From: rajarshi nandy&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: \nvedic-wisdom@ yahoogro=\r\nups. com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Tuesday, March 03, \n2009 5:17 AM&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Remedial \nMeasures Di=\r\nfference (Re: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Resolving Points)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; One feels a strange coolness on the skin and on the eyes.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; A few repititions of the mantra bring about a situation =\r\nwhere the \ndeity &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possesses the sadhaka and the sadh=\r\naka&#39;s prana goes \nupward very &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; quickly( Urdhwa Retas=\r\n),&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; During all meditation the sadhaka sees the feet =\r\nor clothes or hands or \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; face, etc of the deity sitt=\r\ning beside him along with \nminute details of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the ro=\r\nom (even though the sadhak&#39;s \neyes are closed).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The =\r\nsadhak typically becomes dreamless \nexcept for suchaka dreams.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; The whole day the sadhaka \nbehaves like a love lorn person.

How \ncan i &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; again experien=\r\nce the Beloved.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; That then is the experience of mant=\r\nra when it is done correctly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When the sadhak&#39;s per=\r\nsonality is effaced such that the deity&#39;s \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; personal=\r\nity sits there then the sadhak experiences \nhimself as that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Deity(Devata) .&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \nThere then arises no diffe=\r\nrence in the sadhak or the deity commanding a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; cert=\r\nain thing to happen( be it what appears to be good or be it \nthat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which appears to be bad) . The deity&#39;s personality \nis cruci=\r\nal. Ugra &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; devatas make the person care almost for \nn=\r\nothing himself, so self &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; identification is minimised=\r\n and \nthe person&#39;s spiritual evolution &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; continues.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Remember, there is=C2 very little=C2 according to me=\r\n which is black magic. \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is all a use of Shakti. =\r\nIf your Shakti and deity is a \nhigher shakti &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; such a=\r\ns Prachand Chandika, MahaKali, Tara, \nChinnamasta, then your power &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; will be that of God \nhimself( Provided you have Vijnana). A=\r\nfter the death &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of \nthe body, such a sadhaka joins t=\r\nhe realm of the deity or if he was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; originally a Na=\r\nth or a Muni goes to a separate realm reserved for \nthese &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; beings.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
