Just as many objects are seen in a picture, so the various names and\nf=\r\norms exist in Brahman. By negating both names and forms, one can understand=\r\n\nthat what remains is existence, consciousness and bliss.\n\n94. Even though =\r\na man standing on the bank of a river sees his body\nreflected upside down i=\r\nn the water, he nevertheless identifies himself with\nhis own body in the sh=\r\nore; similarly an aspirant after realisation of\nBrahman should know himself=\r\n as Brahman.\n\n96. Different mental creations are formed every moment, while=\r\n those which\npass are\nlost for ever. The objects of the practical world sho=\r\nuld be looked upon\nsimilarly.\n\n97. Childhood is lost in youth and youth is =\r\nlost in old age. The father once\ndead does not return. The day which is pas=\r\nt never comes back.\n\n100. As the big rock lying in the bed of a river remai=\r\nns unmoved, though the\nwater flows over it, so also while names and forms c=\r\nonstantly change, the\nunchanging Brahman does not become otherwise.\n\n102. W=\r\nithout seeing the mirror it is impossible to see the objects reflected\nin i=\r\nt.\nSimilarly wherefrom can there be any knowledge of names and forms withou=\r\nt a\nknowledge of their substratum, which is existence, consciousness and bl=\r\niss ?\n\n103. Having learnt of Brahman as existence, consciousness and bliss,=\r\n one\nshould fix the mind firmly on Him and should restrain it from dwelling=\r\n on\nnames and forms.\n\nXIV. THE BLISS OF KNOWLEDGE\n\n13. As water does not st=\r\nick to the leaves of a lotus so after realisation\nfuture actions cannot sti=\r\nck to the knower.\n\n15. Sri Krishna says: =E2=80=98Just as a blazing fire re=\r\nduces the fuel to ashes, so,\nO Arjuna,the fire of knowledge burns up all ac=\r\ntions=E2=80=99.\n\n16. =E2=80=98He who has no notion of I-ness and whose mind=\r\n is not tainted by desire\nfor results of action is not really a killer even=\r\n if he kills people; he is\nnot bound by his actions=E2=80=99.\n\n42. Let the =\r\nignorant people of the world perform worldly actions and desire\nto\npossess =\r\nwives, children and wealth. I am full of supreme bliss. For what\npurpose\nsh=\r\nould I engage myself in worldly concerns ?\n\nXV. THE BLISS OF OBJECTS\n\n7. (A=\r\nnother Shruti says): =E2=80=98The supreme Self, though one only, exists in\n=\r\nevery object.\nLike the moon reflected in water, though one It appears as ma=\r\nny=E2=80=99.\n\n35. May the Lord who is both Hari and Hara ever be pleased by=\r\n this =E2=80=98Bliss of\nBrahman=E2=80=99 and may He protect all creatures w=\r\nho take refuge in Him and are\npure in\nheart.\n\nSource: http://www.celextel.o=\r\nrg/othervedantabooks/panchadasi.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =\r\n=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00163683401404c91604a7d7ec5f\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-family:Verdana, Arial, sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:=\r\nrgb(51, 51, 51)&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-botto=\r\nm:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;Translated by Swami Swahananda Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chenna=\r\ni&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;93.
