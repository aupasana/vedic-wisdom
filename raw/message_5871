Same goes for existence=\r\n of God/Nature/Self/etc...so the by product is lack of belief in the core e=\r\nssence and purpose of religion i.e. Spirit.\nHe/she will naturally lack fait=\r\nh (Shradhdhaa). Whenever, in life, due to bitter experiences and/or past Sa=\r\nmskaaraas, Logic takes backseat and Faith is born, the person is initiated =\r\nin to religion. It is actually Initiation in to internal religion which may=\r\n or may not reflect externally. However, it is my opinion that, it is bette=\r\nr to depend upon Logical mind while inquiring for truth until faith is born=\r\n  established and even after that in the journey.\nI think, Dr. Atual&#39;s view=\r\n point matches the above. And you already know all these!\n\nPersonally, I am=\r\n tired of logic as my profession is the area of PLCs (i.e. Programmable *Lo=\r\ngic* Controllers :) and writing Process *logic* for long.

Its a \n&gt; Sangam of Many Rivers. The peopl=\r\ne of the culture are so accommodative that \n&gt; Parasis stayed for centuries =\r\nkeeping their identity and religious faith intact \n&gt; without facing any con=\r\nversion threats or any sort of pressure for *conversion*.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hindu is the=\r\n one who *never thinks* even once to convert religious faith of the \n&gt; peop=\r\nle who are believers in other faiths. On the contrary, Hindu encourages the=\r\n \n&gt; people from other faiths to be in their own and love god rather then ge=\r\ntting in \n&gt; to business of conversion. Hindu does not form organised missio=\r\nns, use power of \n&gt; Money or Sword for conversions.\n&gt; Hindu does not hesita=\r\nte, if asked, to go to church and bow to Jesus because he \n&gt; believes deep =\r\nwithin that Jesus is a Saint, a true man of God. If a Muslim \n&gt; friend make=\r\ns a request to a Hindu that This is My Allah in this mosque. Would \n&gt; you c=\r\nome with me in mosque and bow down to show your respect and love? Then \n&gt; H=\r\nindu would certainly do that because Hindu heart naturally believes in the =\r\n\n&gt; famous message of Veda - &quot;Ekam Satya Vipra Bahudha vadanti&quot;. Although he=\r\n would \n&gt; not have read even one line of Veda ever, this timeless message o=\r\nf Veda is \n&gt; ingrained in every pore of his/her being!\n&gt; \n&gt; Hindu does not =\r\nneed any strict Ritualistic initiation to become Hindu. A Hindu \n&gt; believes=\r\n in Sarve Bhavantu SukinaH. Hindu is a born Hindu! Hindu is the one who \n&gt; =\r\nhardly feels pressure from society to go to temples or pray God at specific=\r\n \n&gt; schedules. Hindu has freedom to decide His/her ways to pray God. There =\r\nis no \n&gt; pressure from Hinduism. Hindu has true liberty and that is why Hin=\r\ndu can say \n&gt; that I do not believe in God and still leave happily and resp=\r\nectfully in Hindu \n&gt; Society.\n&gt; Above all Hindu is symbolical of all expans=\r\nive heart!\n&gt; \n&gt; Oops! I just became emotional and unburden probably a Hindu=\r\n heart :)\n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for not able to answer your actual query and digressed=\r\n to something else.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, Chandra Prakash &lt;vedicstudent@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Glad that you liked this interview.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have not read any =\r\nof Swamiji&#39;s work, (not surprising given my level of \n&gt; &gt; ignorance!), but =\r\nthis is a gem of an interview.

At one end is this thought expressed above and at the \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nother end is this notion that to be a Hindu, you have to believe in the Ved=\r\nas \n&gt; &gt; (which, ironically, most people cannot read and those who can, cann=\r\not \n&gt; &gt; understand!)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; warm regards,\n&gt; &gt; Chandraprakash\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ________________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_=\r\npathak@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Wed, February 23, 2=\r\n011 2:52:55 AM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Interview with Swami Chinmay=\r\nanada\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Chandra Prakash,\n&gt; &gt; Thank you!\n&gt; &gt; How true:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; [\n&gt; &gt; Yoga and bhog.
