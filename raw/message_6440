The freedom of a sannyasin c=\r\nan hardly be described. Only a sannyasin can entirely cut off all connectio=\r\nns and ties. Though you have colored your heart, still all members of your =\r\nfamily will cling to you like leeches till the end of your life. You cannot=\r\n entirely eradicate moha or infatuated love and attachment for your family.=\r\n When you fall sick You will be tempted to go in for their help and vice ve=\r\nrsa. The old samskaras will get a new life and moha will bind you with stro=\r\nnger chains once again. It is only when you take sannyasa that they will le=\r\nave you free. They will leave all hopes which they had on you. Only then yo=\r\nu become dead for them. They will not approach you again.\n\n\n"}}
