Bu=\r\nt now this is given to&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; every common man on the street by this =\r\nWebsite owner. Must say he is&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; qualified to play God. He must h=\r\nave taken License to distribute this&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Specialised knowledge fro=\r\nm Brahma Himself.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; But will not try doing either Pitru Tarpan, =\r\nand neither Homam,. on&lt;br&gt;&gt; base&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of Videos and Self Help Bo=\r\noklets. I am going to hire a Real Brahmin&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Pundit and then perf=\r\norm all these Poojas as sanctioned by the Shastras&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; and pay dak=\r\nshina too , to the Brahmin. thats the right\n way I suppose.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Bh=\r\naskar.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Bhas=\r\nkar&quot; bhaskar_jyotish@&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Was just going through a website where this was mentioned :_&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; 1) Do Pitru Tarpan by yourself.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Do Homams by Yo=\r\nurself.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; I was wondering whether to feel happy or sad. Am =\r\nnot sure still.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; because&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; if the procedures we=\r\nre so easy then what is the work of the Brahmin&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Pundits l=\r\neft now. We can do this easily now just like 2 minute&lt;br&gt;&gt; Noodles&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; or bring in Knor Soup Packets from the Bazaar and pour it in h=\r\not&lt;br&gt;&gt; Water&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and Lo and Behold, the Soup is ready. Oo=\r\nh La La la....&nbsp; BHut will&lt;br&gt;&gt; the&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Vegetable Soup=\r\n Powder contain real Vegetables and taste like Fresh&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; vege=\r\ntable Soup ?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; This\n would now exclude the Brahmin Pundits&=\r\nnbsp; necessity and we would&lt;br&gt;&gt; in&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; time to come not =\r\nneed their services any more. We will save on money&lt;br&gt;&gt; ,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; become knowledgable ourselves. But what about the Poor Brahmins ?&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; They&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; would be left without work, and will have to see=\r\nk occupations&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; elsewhere&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in other areas. So i=\r\ns this right to hit on their stomaches ?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But I am happy a=\r\nt the same time. For those Grihasthas who have time&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; can&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; now look up these Procedures, Videos and can feel like Pundits&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves and have the satisfactions of doing homams the=\r\nmselves.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; But at same time I feel sad for the Pundit commu=\r\nnity too. What will&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; happen to them when another Brahmin i=\r\ns giving free tutoring to one&lt;br&gt;&gt; and&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; all ? Who will =\r\nlook after their daily\n expenditures ? From where&lt;br&gt;&gt; would&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; it&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; come ? In future we will have No Real Brahmins left =\r\nand all&lt;br&gt;&gt; Duplicates&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; will abound the earth.&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Ultimately somebody please tell me. I am confused. Should I feel=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; happy&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; or shoudl I feel sad ?&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; B=\r\nhaskar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n---24869868-1352174647-1342281394=:41804--\r\n\n"}}
