Is it ok if I do mantra japa lying on bed comfo=\r\nrtably? Or \n&gt; &gt; should it always be in a a seated positon? Because, lying o=\r\nn \n&gt; &gt; bed comfortably, I can do far more number of rounds than \n&gt; &gt; sittin=\r\ng up. Also, I can concentrate entirely on mantra being \n&gt; &gt; chanted that wa=\r\ny.
