And if =\r\nshe does not know her bhakt, how can she be the\n&gt;shakti to\n&gt;&gt; &gt; rule over a=\r\nll?\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The tests which people refer to are usually the hardships tha=\r\nt one\n&gt;has to face\n&gt;&gt; &gt; while undertaking a sadhana. When one performs a sa=\r\ndhana, it is only\n&gt;to achieve\n&gt;&gt; &gt; some goal whether that be spiritual or m=\r\naterial objective and the\n&gt;need for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhana is becuase the native feel=\r\ns that otherwise he/she may not be\n&gt;able\n&gt;&gt; &gt; to=C3=82 achive the goal easi=\r\nly. So essentially the purpose of a\n&gt;sadhana is to remove\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the karmic b=\r\nurden towards achieving the goal. Law of karma does not\n&gt;let anyone\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of=\r\n the hook though. The harships that you face while performing a\n&gt;sadhana mi=\r\nght\n&gt;&gt; &gt; appear like a &quot;test&quot; to a sadhaka but is essentially the Lord\n&gt;bri=\r\nnging necessary\n&gt;&gt; &gt; hardships your way which creates the suffering in the =\r\nsadhaka that\n&gt;lets the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; sadhaka shed some of the karma. The sadhaka wil=\r\nl eventually be\n&gt;successful but\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the effort required and the hardships =\r\nthat are yet to be faced\n&gt;depends on the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; karmic burden.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; If t=\r\nhe karmic burden is less, suffering is less and success is\n&gt;obtained withou=\r\nt\n&gt;&gt; &gt; much suffering (relatively speaking). If the karmic burden is very\n&gt;=\r\nheavy, you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; may suffer without seeing any success. Though you are now c=\r\nloser to\n&gt;your goal\n&gt;&gt; &gt; after the suffering, but since the goal is not ach=\r\nieved, you do not\n&gt;see the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; results of your effort and feel the effort =\r\nwas a waste.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; MA does not tests...the hardships are brought to you=\r\nr way by her to\n&gt;purge you\n&gt;&gt; &gt; karmically to let you achieve what you want=\r\n.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; This is my belief, and this I use as a basis when performing a\n=\r\n&gt;sadhana.

When one performs a sadhana, it is only&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\nto achieve&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; some goal whether that be spiritual or material =\r\nobjective and the&lt;br&gt;\nneed for&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sadhana is becuase the native =\r\nfeels that otherwise he/she may not be&lt;br&gt;\nable&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; to=C3=82 achi=\r\nve the goal easily. So essentially the purpose of a&lt;br&gt;\nsadhana is to remov=\r\ne&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the karmic burden towards achieving the goal. Law of karma =\r\ndoes not&lt;br&gt;\nlet anyone&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; of the hook though. The harships that=\r\n you face while performing a&lt;br&gt;\nsadhana might&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; appear like a =\r\n&quot;test&quot; to a sadhaka but is essentially the Lord&lt;br&gt;\nbringing necessary&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; hardships your way which creates the suffering in the sadhaka tha=\r\nt&lt;br&gt;\nlets the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; sadhaka shed some of the karma. The sadhaka wi=\r\nll eventually be&lt;br&gt;\nsuccessful but&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; the effort required and t=\r\nhe hardships that are yet to be faced&lt;br&gt;\ndepends on the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; karm=\r\nic burden.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; If the karmic burden is less, suffer=\r\ning is less and success is&lt;br&gt;\nobtained without&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; much sufferin=\r\ng (relatively speaking). If the karmic burden is very&lt;br&gt;\nheavy, you&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; may suffer without seeing any success. Though you are now closer to=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\nyour goal&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; after the suffering, but since the goal is not=\r\n achieved, you do not&lt;br&gt;\nsee the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; results of your effort and =\r\nfeel the effort was a waste.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; MA does not tests.=\r\n..the hardships are brought to your way by her to&lt;br&gt;\npurge you&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; karmically to let you achieve what you want.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n This is my belief, and this I use as a basis when performing a&lt;br&gt;\nsadhana=\r\n.
