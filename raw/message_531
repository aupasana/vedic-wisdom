Thank you for posting it. Swami \nBhaskarananda Saraswati is undoubtedly a profound scholar and a great yogi. \nThere are those who are highly scholarly and there are those who have \nexperienced. Those with scholarship and experience are so rare.\n\nWhenever I think of Swami Bhaskarananda, I am reminded of a small episode \ninvolving Swami Akhandananda. He was one of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s 16 \ndirect disciples. He wandered all over India and met many saints. When in \nVaranasi, he met Trilinga Swami and took his blessings. Then he went and met \nSwami Bhaskarananda. Bhaskarananda was impressed with the young man and \nwanted to teach Vedas to him. Swami Akhandananda (he was only known as \nGangadhar then - not renounced yet) politely refused saying, &quot;The power of \nsight which I would use for attaining knowledge by reading books, please \nturn it inward, so that I can experience Atman&quot;. Bhaskarananda was not \noffended. Instead, he marvelled at the young man and remarked, &quot;I see you \nare a yogi.&quot;\n\nThere is much to learn from this small episode...\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n\n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;Saravanan Balaraman&quot; &lt;ethinder@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, October 10, 2008 1:39 PM\n&gt; Subject: [sivacharya] Fwd: Chandi Sapathasati Rahasya as per Shri\n&gt; Bhaskarananda Saraswathi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In ambaa-l@yahoogroups.com, venkata sriram\n&gt; &lt;sriram_sapthasathi@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear members,\n&gt;\n&gt;  This is the Chandi Sapthasati Rahasya which was expounded by a\n&gt; great Dattatreya Upasaka.  The turiya asrama name of this upasaka is\n&gt; Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswati who happens to be the devi upasaka in\n&gt; the lineage of Shri Vasudevananda Saraswati (Tembe Maharaj).  There\n&gt; is no whereabouts of this great upasaka but I got some of the\n&gt; wonderful manuscripts related to Chandi Sapthasati Rahasya and Yoga\n&gt; Gayatri Upasana, its process of meditation and the process of Shat\n&gt; Chakra Bhedana.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Though the presentation of entire contents of the manuscripts is\n&gt; not possible for me as the manuscripts runs into 150 pages, here is\n&gt; an attempt of mine to highlight some of the important points which\n&gt; may be useful to the upasakas.  However, this should be learnt from\n&gt; sadguru hailing from sat-sampradaya.\n&gt;\n&gt;  The 3 charitas of sapthasati are the symbolic representation of 3\n&gt; knots or grandhis namely brahma grandhi, Vishnu grandhi and rudra\n&gt; grandhi.  The chit-AbhAsa (false identification of the sthula,\n&gt; sukshma and karana dehas to be �?oone�?Ts own self�?�).  This\n&gt; �?~chidAbhAsa�?� is of 3 types: karmaja, sahaja and bhramaja.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Brahma grandhi is the identification of oneself with sthula deha\n&gt; (sthula deha abhimana).   The sthula and sukshma deha tAdAtmyata\n&gt; (false identification of oneself with gross and subtle body). This is\n&gt; Karmaja Chidabhasa. The annihilation of pUrvajanma vAsanAs in the\n&gt; form of �?oMala�?� or �?odirt�?� is Brahma Grandhi Bhedana.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Vishnu Grandhi is the identification of oneself with sukshma deha\n&gt; (sukshma deha abhimana).    AntahkaraNa-chidAbhAsa-tadAtmyata is the\n&gt; Sahaja ChidAbhAsa.  Annihilation of manO-vikshEpa is the Vishnu\n&gt; Grandhi Bhedana.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Rudra Grandhi is the identification of oneself with Karana deha\n&gt; (chidAbhAsa adhishTAna chaitanya tAdAtmyata).  This is Bhramaja\n&gt; Chidabhasa.  The dawn of sva-svarupa jnana when the avarana dosha\n&gt; (veil of ignorance in the form of Avidya) is removed is the Rudra\n&gt; Grandhi Bhedana.\n&gt;\n&gt;  So, Brahma-Vishnu-Rudra Grandhis are the 3 episodes or charitas of\n&gt; Chandi Sapthasati.  The sumedha rishi of Sapthasathi is the Rishi\n&gt; Haritayana who was initiated into Srividya by Shri Parashurama.\n&gt; Parashurama inturn was initiated by Sage Dattatreya.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswathi explaining the inner significance of\n&gt; Sapthsati says that �?osavarni�?� is the surya sakti,\n&gt; �?osvArochisha�?� is the svarga-sambandha-jyoti,\n&gt; �?ochaitravamshasamudbhavah�?� is the being born and re-born as\n&gt; different species (chitra vichitra janma), �?okshitimandala�?� is the\n&gt; gross physical body or sarira, �?osuratha�?� is the jiva who is\n&gt; interested in 3rd purusharta ie., kama and �?oSamadhi�?� is the jiva\n&gt; who is interested in 4th purushartha ie., moksha.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Vishnu-karna-mala is the �?omala�?� or �?odirt�?� or �?ocovering�?�\n&gt; around the chidAkasa (Vishnu-karna).  During the dissolution, Vishnu\n&gt; is one with Yogamaya and hence Chit swarupa.  Karna is the sruti\n&gt; (ear) whose tanmatra is sound.  So, Madhu and Kaitabha are the Mala /\n&gt; Dirt that covers the Nirmala Chidakasa.  Madhu is the Ananda Lakshana\n&gt; and Kaitabha is the �?omyriad of insects�?� in the form of Sanchita\n&gt; Karma.  The Brahma which is symbolic representation of Manas (Mind)\n&gt; praises the Mahamaya to annihilate the Madhu-Kaitabha in the form of\n&gt; Sanchita Karma.  Waking up of Vishnu is the MahAprANa in Action.\n&gt;\n&gt;  So, annihilitation of   Madhu-Kaitabha is the removal of Karmajata-\n&gt; tadAtmyata in the form of brahmagrandhi bhedana (Vasana Kshaya).\n&gt;\n&gt;  The Madhyama Charita indicates the Vishnu Grandhi Bhedana which is\n&gt; of the form of Sahaja Chidabhasa.  Mahishasura represents Rajo Guna\n&gt; in the form of Krodha (anger).\n&gt;\n&gt;  Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswati also describes a �?oSecret Upanishad\n&gt; Vidya�?� which is embedded in Madhyama Charita.  This is called\n&gt; �?oJyotishmati Vidya�?�.  The Nada which the Devi makes is the\n&gt; Anahata Dhwani and the Simha (lion) vahana is the Himsa dharma which\n&gt; the sadhaka has to adopt during the upasana. The Jiva with Himsa\n&gt; Bhava should annihilate his Jiva-bhava.  The vyashti prana of the\n&gt; Jiva dissolves in Samasti Prana.  When this is achieved, the Sukshma-\n&gt; deha abhimana drops off.  This is Vishnu Grandhi Bhedana.  This is\n&gt; the victory over sahaja-chidAbhAsa.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Though among the 5 kosas, the Jiva has penetrated till Vijnana-maya\n&gt; Kosa, he still faces the lack of BrahmAnubhUti which is only through\n&gt; AparOksha Jnana.  With the dawn of Aparoksha Jnana, the last knot is\n&gt; removed which is Rudra Grandhi.  With the removal of veil of\n&gt; ignorance, the avarana drops in the form of Bhramaja ChidAbhAsa.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Chanda denotes mUlAvidya; munda denotes tUlAvidya; dhUmralOchana\n&gt; denotes bhrAnti, raktabIja denotes bhOga lAlasa (bhOga vAncha);\n&gt; shumbha denotes ahamkara; nishumbha denotes mamakara. The 8 armies of\n&gt; shumbha-nishumbha denotes:\n&gt;  ghriNa, lajja, bhaya, shanka, jugupsa, kula, shIla, jAti.  These 8\n&gt; tendencies are 8 pAsAs (ashta-pAsa).  To remove these 8 pasas, the 8\n&gt; vidya murtis come forth in the form of Brahmi, �?�..etc.\n&gt;\n&gt;  Shri Bhaskarananda Saraswati explains wonderfully the Chandi\n&gt; Navakshari Mantra taking the pramana from Damara Tantra and Shri\n&gt; Bhaskara.  Chamunda is the destroyer of Mula Avidya and Tula Avidya.\n&gt;\n&gt;  There are 3 devatas in Urdhwa Amnaya.  They are Viccheswari,\n&gt; Hamseshwari, Samvartheshwari.  Vicche is the address to this Urdhwa\n&gt; Amnaya Devata �?oViccheshwari�?� which is the �?overy auspicious\n&gt; deity�?� and �?oever intent in giving liberation out of\n&gt; compassion�?�.  This is the �?ochitkala rupa parama Ardra dEvta�?�\n&gt; which bestows the �?opralaya jnana�?� to the upasaka.  Moreover,\n&gt; �?ovicche�?� is vit+cha+I which implies �?ochit�?�, �?osat�?� and\n&gt; Ananda rupa of the Chamunda which is tri-shati rupini as Mahakali\n&gt; (aim), Mahalakshi (hrim) and Mahasaraswati (klim).  To such Chamunda\n&gt; who destroys the Mula Avidya and Tula Avidya, I bow.\n&gt;\n&gt;  This is the Chandi Sapthasati Rahasya given by Paramahamsa\n&gt; Parivrajakacharya Bhaskarananda Saraswathi who hails from Datta\n&gt; Sampradaya.\n&gt;\n&gt;  With regards,\n&gt;  sriram\n\n\n"}}
