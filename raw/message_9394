Is it =\r\nok if I do mantra japa lying on bed comfortably? Or \n&gt; &gt; should it always b=\r\ne in a a seated positon? Because, lying on \n&gt; &gt; bed comfortably, I can do f=\r\nar more number of rounds than \n&gt; &gt; sitting up. Also, I can concentrate enti=\r\nrely on mantra being \n&gt; &gt; chanted that way. Also I read somewhere Anga nyas=\r\na, Kara \n&gt; &gt; nyasa etc.are not necessary, just chanting the specified \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmantra is adequate. What&#39;s your opinion on this?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
