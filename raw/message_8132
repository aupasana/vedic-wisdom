Kindly do not judge me b=\r\nased on my condition, rather give me some positive solution and perspective=\r\n to what I am going through.\n\nI am a very strong beloved of god and a very =\r\nstrong devotee. I love to worship him as much as I can.however, all my pass=\r\nion, interest seems to get drained and discouraged due to my mindset and th=\r\ne hell I go through because of it. I always , always get negative & abusive=\r\n thoughts and tie those to the god. For ex, if I hear a foul language, see =\r\na negative thing, bad or foul my mind relates or ties it to god. My mind st=\r\nart abusing god with the same foul language.\nWhen I do Japam, =A0my mind wo=\r\nuld not get concentration, but goes into this evil mode with racing thought=\r\ns.\nI can&#39;t see directly into the eyes of god with the fear of my mind abusi=\r\nng him I can&#39;t focus my drishti on god statues. My thoughts are extremely f=\r\noul...most specially foul language. However, I battle my thoughts with my w=\r\norship, which means I don&#39;t give up praying him. I requested him several ti=\r\nmes to relive me from such pain so that I can increase my devotion and pray=\r\ners. I love him. I want to pray him.=A0\nCurrently, my mind and it&#39;s racing =\r\nevil & foul thoughts have become a road block in my devotion and trying to =\r\nkeep me away from him as much as possible. At one point of time, they domin=\r\nated me and I had to stay away from praying him for a while.\n\nNow my questi=\r\nons are\nAm I a Maha papi or ghora papi that this is happening to me?\nWhy do=\r\nes it happen to me?\nIs it some kind of disorder\nAm in incurring wrath of go=\r\nd=A0\nI am scared to death that I am accumulating the greatest sin enough fo=\r\nr some 100 births\nWhat can I do to get out of this perversion and be able t=\r\no concentrate on him\nI want to worship god like every one does\nI am highly =\r\nstressed because of this constant battle. My forehead area, jaws are always=\r\n in pain because of this stress.\n\nPlease help me , but do no hate me. Pleas=\r\ne do not disregard or discard my email. This is a situation I can&#39;t disclos=\r\ne to anyone in person with the fear of hatred and resentment. I am hoping t=\r\no get some relief from learned scholars like yourself.\n\n\n"}}
