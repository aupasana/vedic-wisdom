Purusha is the =\r\nwitness of it all.\n=C2=A0\nThough each karma should give karmaphala that is =\r\ncommensurate with it, that requires an *agent* to deliver the karmaphala, i=\r\n.e. another being. So this requires a complicated balancing act on part of =\r\nCosmic Cumulative Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are very compl=\r\nicated rules that decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and picking of age=\r\nnts for their delivery.\n\n=C2=A0\nAt any time, some karmas from one&#39;s past ar=\r\ne placed in a &quot;must experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool, some karmas i=\r\nn a &quot;preferably experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool and the rest in th=\r\ne third pool which may not be experienced anytime soon. The way karmas are =\r\nassigned and ordered in these pools is based on the balancing of karma/karm=\r\naphala sequencing of all beings.\n=C2=A0\nThe assignment and ordering of thes=\r\ne pools will constantly undergo churn as one engages in various new actions=\r\n and adds them to the pools. Also, as new people enter one&#39;s life, possibil=\r\nities in terms of karmaphala delivery agents and sequencing may change and =\r\nhence the pools may be re-arranged.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nAs one en=\r\ngages in remedial measures such as prayers, fasting, donations etc, one may=\r\n transform one&#39;s nature, change one&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one&#39;s d=\r\nynamics with other beings (including planets, deities etc, who are the subt=\r\nle agents of delivery of karmaphala, who operate through other people who a=\r\nct as physical agents of delivery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged as =\r\na result. Some undesirable karmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or push=\r\ned down in order within the same pool.

It is all about re-arranging ka=\r\nrmas between the karmik pools. Every action by one, or even people around o=\r\nne, has the potential to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma about to gi=\r\nve karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was not to give karmaphala a=\r\nnytime soon may be advanced sooner.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, remember that the remed=\r\nial measure has to be as intense as the karma that it is trying to manipula=\r\nte.

Thus, it was possible for a beggar to sud=\r\ndenly find himself the king. Whose karma is this?=C2=A0\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Vasishtha give=\r\ns two answers: (1) This is the karma of the ministers, king, and all the ci=\r\ntizens, and (2) This is the karma of the beggar turned king.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Everythin=\r\ng is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s karma made him a king. The elephant&#39;s karma=\r\n allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the king. The minister&#39;s karma al=\r\nlowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the king. And the citizens&#39; karm=\r\na allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and accept the result.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;The s=\r\nanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oath. Many of the curse=\r\ns that we see are for the benefit of mankind, and are actually blessings. A=\r\nt the end of the day, some people with a certain amount of purity of speech=\r\n discharge their tapas shakti through speech.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;When it comes to people =\r\nand their karmic pipeline, we usually make an assumption. We assume that th=\r\nere is a person, and separate from the person are his many karmas. These ka=\r\nrmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time. We then want someone to co=\r\nme and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic pipeline.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Vasishtha=\r\n teaches us that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the same thing. You are your ka=\r\nrmas. And you are nothing but your mind-impressions ... your vaasanaas. In =\r\nother words, your vaasanaas are your karmas.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;If you can change your va=\r\nasanaas, you have changed your karma. Or course, that is easier said than d=\r\none.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Any moment when your mind becomes quiet is a blessing. Any moment=\r\n when your mind becomes agitated is a curse. As sadhakas, we run after quie=\r\nting the mind !\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;sasneham,\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0ajit\n&gt;\n&gt;On Tue, Feb 26=\r\n, 2013 at 8:08 AM, &lt;dgporob@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;Dear Narasimha Ji,\n&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 I was pondering over few things we routinely come =\r\nacross as a part of worship and how it manipulates karma pipe line,\n&gt;&gt;(1) W=\r\nhen someone gives a `curse&#39; or does a prayoga such as `maran&#39; or `uchhatan&#39;=\r\n what happens to a person who is at receiving end, does his bad karma comes=\r\n forward or is it a new parabdha that is created. I vaguely remember Vimala=\r\nnanda mentioning something about a Saint&#39;s curse in Aghora trilogy.\n&gt;&gt;(2) O=\r\nn similar note, what happens when you get `blessings&#39; say from a saint or e=\r\nlders? We also come across lot of tantric items like Rudraksha, Parad Shiva=\r\nlinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =E2=80=93 what do this items really do if t=\r\nhey work? Something similar with wearing gemstones for planets =E2=80=93 do=\r\n they bring forward good karmas or they create new ones?\n&gt;&gt;(3) I recollect =\r\nan episode from famous &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well known in Maharashtra), wherein =\r\na just widowed lady cried out to Shri Guru &quot;If we cannot change `parabdha, =\r\nthen, why do we worship God at all&quot;. At that point Shri Guru rejuvenates he=\r\nr dead husband, but later tells his shisya, that he has only readjusted the=\r\n karma from next birth. [Please excuse me if this is not exact word to word=\r\n, as I am trying to recollect this episode from old memory]. So question I =\r\nhave is, does our sadhana change karmaphal to a great extent or it is just =\r\nour perception that changes?\n&gt;&gt;Thanking you,\n&gt;&gt;Digamber\n&gt;&gt;\r\n--944242502-1060178189-1362349599=:57515\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ar=\r\nial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Namaste friends,&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span&gt;Ajit&#39;s reply to &lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;Digamber ji&#39;s nice questions is thoughtful.

The most imp=\r\nortant thing is to not add more serious bad karmas to the pipeline &lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-style: italic;&quot;&gt;n&lt;span&gt;ow&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span&gt;.&lt;/span&gt; Simply pu=\r\nt, selfish actions and actions that cause pain or harm to others are bad ka=\r\nrmas and selfless actions and actions that cause pleasure or benefit to oth=\r\ners are good karmas.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When it comes to manipulating the pre-exi=\r\nsting pipeline of karmas awaiting karmaphala, through conscious effort and =\r\ncurrent action, yes, it is possible and general guidelines are available in=\r\n shastras, but we can&#39;t be certain about the specific impact of each action=\r\n. One thing is for sure - remedial measure for overcoming a karma has to be=\r\n commensurate with the karma\n itself.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;You need only small forc=\r\ne to push a cat out of your way, but need a large force to push an elephant=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, hel=\r\nvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spiritu=\r\nality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.v=\r\nedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;=\r\ncolor:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;font-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans=\r\n-serif;background-color:transparent;font-style:normal;&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;border-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); mar=\r\ngin-left: 5px; margin-top: 5px; padding-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-fa=\r\nmily: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-f=\r\namily: times new roman, new york, times, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=\r\n=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;\n &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@gma=\r\nil.com&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] few questions&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; =\r\n&lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv31282356&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;displ=\r\nay:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv31282356ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n   =\r\n   \n      &lt;div&gt;Dear&nbsp;Digamber,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When a kingdom =\r\nhad no royal heirs, a special elephant was appointed by the courtiers to ra=\r\nndomly pick the next king. Thus, it was possible for a beggar to suddenly f=\r\nind himself the king. Whose karma is this?&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;Vasishtha gives two answers: (1) This is the karma of the ministers, king,=\r\n and all the citizens, and (2) This is the karma of the beggar turned king.=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Everything is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s karma ma=\r\nde him a king. The elephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pic=\r\nk the king. The minister&#39;s karma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pi=\r\nck the king. And the citizens&#39; karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom=\r\n, and accept the result.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaa=\r\npa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oath. Many of the curses that we see are =\r\nfor the benefit of mankind, and are actually blessings. At the end of the d=\r\nay, some people with a certain amount of purity of speech discharge their t=\r\napas shakti through speech.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When it comes to peo=\r\nple and their karmic pipeline, we usually make an assumption. We assume tha=\r\nt there is a person, and separate from the person are his many karmas. Thes=\r\ne karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time. We then want someone t=\r\no come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karmic pipeline.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Vasishtha teaches us that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; are the s=\r\name thing. You are your karmas. And you are nothing but your mind-impressio=\r\nns ... your vaasanaas. In other words, your vaasanaas are your karmas.&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, you have changed y=\r\nour karma. Or course, that is easier said than done.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;Any moment when your mind becomes quiet is a blessing. Any moment when y=\r\nour mind becomes agitated is a curse. As sadhakas, we run after quieting th=\r\ne mind !&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;sasneham,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;ajit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv31282356gmail_qu=\r\note&quot;&gt;On Tue, Feb 26, 2013 at 8:08 AM,  &lt;span dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofo=\r\nllow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:dgporob@...&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto=\r\n:dgporob@...&quot;&gt;dgporob@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote =\r\nclass=3D&quot;yiv31282356gmail_quote&quot; style=3D&quot;border-left:1px #ccc solid;&quot;&gt;\n\nDe=\r\nar Narasimha Ji,&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; I was pondering over few t=\r\nhings we routinely come across as a part of worship and how it manipulates =\r\nkarma pipe line,&lt;br&gt;\n(1) When someone gives a `curse&#39; or does a prayoga suc=\r\nh as `maran&#39; or `uchhatan&#39; what happens to a person who is at receiving end=\r\n, does his bad karma comes forward or is it a new parabdha that is created.=\r\n I vaguely remember Vimalananda mentioning something about a Saint&#39;s curse =\r\nin Aghora trilogy.&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n(2) On similar note, what happens when you get `bl=\r\nessings&#39; say from a saint or elders? We also come across lot of tantric ite=\r\nms like Rudraksha, Parad Shivalinga or say Shwetarka Ganapati =E2=80=93 wha=\r\nt do this items really do if they work? Something similar with wearing gems=\r\ntones for planets =E2=80=93 do they bring forward good karmas or they creat=\r\ne new ones?&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n(3) I recollect an episode from famous &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (we=\r\nll known in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed lady cried out to Shri Gur=\r\nu &quot;If we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we worship God at all&quot;. At t=\r\nhat point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, but later tells his shisy=\r\na, that he has only readjusted the karma from next birth. [Please excuse me=\r\n if this is not exact word to word, as I am trying to recollect this episod=\r\ne from old memory]. So question I have is, does our sadhana change karmapha=\r\nl to a great extent or it is just our perception that changes?&lt;br&gt;\n\n\nThanki=\r\nng you,&lt;br&gt;\nDigamber&lt;br&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;   &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--944242502-1060178189-1362349599=:57515--\r\n\n"}}
