They become \n&quot;purified&quot; due to the contact and some of their impurities are removed. \nThese coins can be put in the pooja room along with the idols of gods and \nyou can recite your mantras before them.\n\nIn fact, if you want to invoke god in a solid form (like an idol) and offer \nmantras, these coins are a good candidate. Thus, you can use these coins in \nmany poojas and vratams. The idols in your pooja room may have many \nimpurities due to the thoughts, speech and actions of the persons involved \nwith its making and distribution. A coin purified in a homam may is a good \nconductor of divine energy. Even though a coin from homam may look deformed \nand burnt, it is actually as appropriate for invoking gods as a beautiful \nidol.\n\nIf somebody performs homam on a regular basis, it is not necessary to put \ncoins in poornaahuti everyday. One then ends up with too many coins. When \none offers oneself in the poornaahuti, whatever happens to the coin happens \nto one&#39;s own consciousness slowly. When one can purify one&#39;s own \nconsciousness, there is no need to surround oneself with external objects of \nsome purity. The final goal in surrounding oneself with external objects of \nsome purity is to eventually purify oneself. Fire in homam being the purest \nthing we have access to in the physical plane, spending time with it \nfrequently is the fastest way. In the absence of such a practice, the \nobjects purified in a homam can be used.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;dheena0104&quot; &lt;dheena0104@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, March 01, 2008 4:12 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Thanks a lot ji-Homa coins\n\n\n&gt; OM NAMAHSHIVAAYA\n&gt; Dear Sri Narasimha P.V.R.

One of the best I have seen is\n&gt; by Sri\n&gt;&gt; Chaitanyananda and called &quot;Sri Vidya Pooja Vidhi&quot;. It is in Tamil,\n&gt; English\n&gt;&gt; and Hindi. It is a very elaborate book on the worship of Sri\n&gt; Chakra. It is\n&gt;&gt; written by the gentleman who runs Rajarajeswari peetham at Rush\n&gt; (near\n&gt;&gt; Rochester), New York. It is a fantastic temple (www.srividya.org).\n&gt; His\n&gt;&gt; god-brother Sri Karunamaya Baba used to live in the Boston area\n&gt; (where I\n&gt;&gt; live) and teach Sri chakra pooja to people in this area\n&gt; (www.srimeru.org).\n&gt;&gt; Now he is the pontiff of a religious order in Devipuram (near\n&gt; Visakhapatnam,\n&gt;&gt; AP, India). Both of them belong to this religious order\n&gt; (www.devipuram.com).\n&gt;&gt; Sri Karunamaya Baba conducts seminars in India and US and teaches\n&gt; Sri Chakra\n&gt;&gt; pooja. This book gives the method used by their religious order\n&gt; and lineage.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;&gt; From: &quot;dheena0104&quot; &lt;dheena0104@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 27, 2008 10:38 PM\n&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Sri Chakra pooja-Ji&#39;s version\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; OM NAMAHSHIVAAYA\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Sri Narasimha P.V.R.
