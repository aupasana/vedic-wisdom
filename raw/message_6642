But still, today being a working day, I put=\r\n some time limit and was not too convinced with the way the homam went toda=\r\ny. The dry coconuts were not catching fire (unlike the twigs I used the las=\r\nt 2 days) and the fire went off twice before I put camphor to reignite. \nAn=\r\nyways, I am planning to do the homam in the weekends only unless I get to k=\r\nnow how I can manage sandhyavandanam along with homam ! \nPreviously I was a=\r\nble to do Gayatri mantra and HareKrsna mahamantra in 90 mins or 100 mins an=\r\nd that was all completely mantras.\nThen, I started sandhya vandanam along w=\r\nith Harekrsna mahamantra and my mahamantra numbers came down to accommodate=\r\n the rituals of sandhya vandanam.\nToday (unliked the weekend where I took m=\r\nore than 2 hours), I realized neither I have done sandhya vandanam properly=\r\n nor the homam properly to accommodate both of them. Not sure if I should d=\r\no daily homam if the main part of the prayers go in worrying about the agni=\r\n in the kundam !\n\nMy ranting aside, do we need to further dry the dry cocon=\r\nuts; not sure why the small 1x1 pieces did not burn well. The final poornah=\r\nuti has burnt well with half dry coconut. I use good amount of ghee and I a=\r\nm not sure if that much is needed as most of it simply flows down.\n\nLastly,=\r\n I tried in some shops yes&#39;day and everyone is selling iron homa kundam onl=\r\ny and they reply back that copper is not used !!\n\nThanks Ajit for your resp=\r\nonses again.\n\nThanks VPathak.\n\nregards\nrAma\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Nagraj ji and o=\r\nther friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; [&gt; =C2 \n&gt; &gt; 1. cleaning up the previous homam residues, =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; 2. putting new aluminium foil in the homa kunda and below the homakund=\r\na, \n&gt; &gt; 3. putting aluminium foils before the homa kunda where I keep the g=\r\nhee so that any spills would happen on the foil, \n&gt; &gt; 4.cleaning the Kalasa=\r\n, putting chandan and kumkum for kalas, putting askshatas pouring water, pu=\r\ntting a flower in the kalasa.\n&gt; &gt; 5. preparing an oil lamp\n&gt; &gt; 6. putting d=\r\narbhas around the homa kunda\n&gt; &gt; 7. putting starter wood block in the homa =\r\nkunda along with camphor and darbhas\n&gt; &gt; 8. melting the gree \n&gt; &gt; =C2 \n&gt; ]\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; The issue of &quot;Arrangement&quot; for a Homa is almost for everybody and i ha=\r\nve also gone trough it for quite sometime. I would like to suggest from my =\r\nown method which may help you bring down 20 minutes to 10Min.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) First=\r\n of all, It is advisable to avoid Aluminum Foil. Aluminum foil cutting for =\r\ncorrect size and then adjusting on Homa kundam takes a good amount of time.=\r\n I did it for some 6 months initially and then there was a Message from Nar=\r\nasimha that it is better to avoid Aluminum foil because Aluminum being a re=\r\nlatively modern metal and may carry Rahu&#39;s predominance. I stopped foil sin=\r\nce then...\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) No need to wash Homa Kundam every day. I do it once in a=\r\n month or so. Let it be black and dark.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If the above 2 points are obs=\r\nerved, it can save some 5 to 7 minutes easily.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now, one can do followi=\r\nng arrangements previous nights (the people who do Homa in the morning)\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; -Empty the Homa Kundam and keep it clean (Tissue papers are very handy fo=\r\nr this) and ready for next morning\n&gt; - Keep the Dry Coconut pieces or Wood =\r\nready.\n&gt; - Keep the Lamp ready with Wick\n&gt; - Keep Camphor, Rice mixed with =\r\nghee and turmeric, Flowers,  etc... ready. (I do not use flowers any more. =\r\nUse Akshatas mixed with Turmeric as flowers..Bhagwan ko bolta hun BhavnaO k=\r\no Samjho! Phul ki jagape Chawal se kaam chalalo:-)\n&gt; \n&gt; So when I get ready=\r\n for Homam, I just have to fill up the copper tumbler with water and heat u=\r\np the ghee and few other such activities which takes around 5to7 Minutes in=\r\n total.\n&gt; \n&gt; Before i forget i must remind that there is no need to keep th=\r\ne Darbha in 4 directions every time. One can keep those Darbhas at the same=\r\n place as many days as possible.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Please ignore this Fool if the pos=\r\nt did not make much sense.\n&gt; Yours,\n&gt; \n&gt; HavanOtpal\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, Nagraj Kota &lt;nagraj_um@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; That was=C2=\r\n=A0a nice post Ajit. I am also one of those people who, because of guilt fa=\r\nctor of skipping sandhyavandana, unable to do the homa daily. I do it every=\r\n week. But there is a little other logistics issue for me. I live in the US=\r\n and I do my homa in my living room where the Wood burning Fireplace (east =\r\nfacing)=C2=A0is located. My pooja room however, is in a different location =\r\ntowards north of the house. I have a big Shiva Lingam in my pooja room for =\r\nwhich I do daily abhishekam in the morning, (with Rudra Adhyaya on Mondays)=\r\n. So, if I have do both nithyapooja and homam daily, it is really time taki=\r\nng as arranging for homam takes almost 20 minutes, on a routine basis. Any =\r\nideas for managing this better? For instance, arrangements include, \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 1. cleaning up the previous homam residues, \n&gt; &gt; 2. putting new =\r\naluminium foil in the homa kunda and below the homakunda, \n&gt; &gt; 3. putting a=\r\nluminium foils before the homa kunda where I keep the ghee so that any spil=\r\nls would happen on the foil, \n&gt; &gt; 4.cleaning the Kalasa, putting chandan an=\r\nd kumkum for kalas, putting askshatas pouring water, putting a flower in th=\r\ne kalasa.\n&gt; &gt; 5. preparing an oil lamp\n&gt; &gt; 6. putting darbhas around the ho=\r\nma kunda\n&gt; &gt; 7. putting starter wood block in the homa kunda along with cam=\r\nphor and darbhas\n&gt; &gt; 8. melting the gree \n&gt; &gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; All these take fro=\r\nm 15-20 minutes. If I have time, I do have a ninth step of cooking some foo=\r\nd for mahanaivedyam which takes an additional 20-30 minutes. With all these=\r\n, doing a homam and regular pooja in=C2=A0a different place is really diffi=\r\ncult on a daily basis. But I want to do that.

Just skip this mail altogether. If\n&gt; &gt; you are doing sandhyAvandana, don=\r\n&#39;t want to stop doing it (because of\n&gt; &gt; the guilt factor), and want to bet=\r\nter integrate it with homa, this\n&gt; &gt; mail may be of some limited value. I h=\r\nave studied several\n&gt; &gt; sandhyAvandana, aupAsana and homa manuals.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Many traditions split sandhyAvandana into two parts: (a) purificatory\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nrites and (b) gAyatri-japa. If you want to integrate with homa, do\n&gt; &gt; homa=\r\n between parts (a) and (b). The first part, with the mArjana etc\n&gt; &gt; hardly=\r\n takes 1-2 minutes. After that, do the homa. After the purnahuti\n&gt; &gt; etc, y=\r\nou can do the second part of sandhyAvandana (gayatri japa)\n&gt; &gt; starting wit=\r\nh the AvAhana. Spend as much time in this meditation as\n&gt; &gt; you can. Then, =\r\nyou can do the upasthAna etc, which will add another 2\n&gt; &gt; minutes or so. C=\r\nonsider skipping all the elaborate nyAsas, and the\n&gt; &gt; repeated prAnAyAmas.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Really speaking, everything important is already there in the hom=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; manual. From the &quot;full sandhyAvandana&quot; procedure, you can pull in a\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; few veda mantras if you choose to. But, it really isn&#39;t necessary.\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; If you look at aupAsana procedures, you will find that Narasimha&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmanual is more elaborate than the aupAsana. Homa is basically a\n&gt; &gt; superse=\r\nt of aupAsana. Where the manual differs, it is more relevant\n&gt; &gt; for our mo=\r\ndern lifestyle, and you don&#39;t need to add anything to it.\n&gt; &gt; Frankly, I ba=\r\nsically follow Narasimha&#39;s manual, but say &quot;aupAsana&quot; in\n&gt; &gt; the sankalpa. =\r\nThey are that similar. The fire in which you do\n&gt; &gt; &quot;upAsana&quot; is &quot;aupAsana&quot;=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; bhavadiiyaH,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ajit\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
