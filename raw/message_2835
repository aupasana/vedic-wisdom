However, even=\r\ntually the smell will be gone! How long it takes to disappear depends on ho=\r\nw strong the smell was when the stick was burnt.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Similarly, when=\r\n a great saint meditates in a place, the air there will be filled with that=\r\n saint&#39;s spiritual energy. Even after the saint leaves that place or leaves=\r\n earth altogether, that energy will linger there. Slowly it becomes weak an=\r\nd disappears.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; In many famous temples these days, priests have be=\r\ncome commercial and do not have the devotion needed. The rituals performed =\r\nevery few years to re-energize the idols \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; It is my humble opinion that some famous temples do not have much div=\r\nine presence today, though I do not want to name any names. At the same tim=\r\ne, some not-so-well- known temples seem to have a powerful divine presence.=\r\n\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I was very impressed with the=C2=A0Krishna temple in Mayapur (I=\r\nSKCON head office is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and Arunachalam hills =\r\nin Tiruvannamalai (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is a tremendous amount o=\r\nf spiritual energy in those places. There are several temples where the ido=\r\nl is practically alive. For example, even 123 years after Ramakrishna Param=\r\nahamsa left, the Kaali idol at Dakshineshwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the =\r\nsame impression at the famous Kalighat temple which is also in Calcutta.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; There was one small temple in Tamil Nadu that I was taken to by a =\r\npriest who took me to visit about 30 temples all over Tamil Nadu before we =\r\ndid the Shata Chandi homam in Chennai in 2006. I never heard of that temple=\r\n before and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the=C2=A0form of the=\r\n divine Mother=C2=A0present there was a Tamil language name and I did not u=\r\nnderstand it. I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my ey=\r\nes and started meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzle=\r\nd by a vision of a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like Sun=\r\n. I felt that there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do not =\r\nremember the name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without r=\r\noof over the goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times=\r\n, but the roof came down in a fire accident each time and they finally deci=\r\nded that the goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min=\r\n and left\n&gt;  in a hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone from =\r\nTamil Nadu probably knows the name of the temple and goddess.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Li=\r\nke this, I am sure there are many temples with a powerful divine presence a=\r\ncross India.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one o=\r\nf my best experiences when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal temple at =\r\nAalandi near Pune. I am sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still meditating in=\r\n the underground chamber there.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Even =\r\nthe middle of a busy road in India is better for meditating than a temple i=\r\nn USA. These western countries are so filled with rajas and tamas. There is=\r\n rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of sattwa there. Thus, any =\r\ntemple in India will be a good place to meditate, but my view is that there=\r\n is not much left at *some* temples. But some temples are really good.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; If one has a chance to spend a few months doing spiritual sadhana =\r\nnear a temple, I suggest the following:\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, =\r\nPuri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam, Tiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hil=\r\nls)=C2=A0and Narayana=C2=A0vanam (near Tirupati)=C2=A0in south India, Shird=\r\ni, Aalandi, Dwaraka=C2=A0and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in west India, Var=\r\nanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisailam and Mantralaya=\r\nm=C2=A0and Ujjain in central India.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; There are many other good pl=\r\naces, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a temple once is one thing an=\r\nd staying there for several months while maintaining a simple lifestyle and=\r\n doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or japam) there is quite another.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.=\r\nVedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicA=\r\nst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ved=\r\nic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. n=\r\net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Jyo=\r\ntish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; Sri Jagan=\r\nnath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Orig=\r\ninal Message ----- \n&gt; From: Astro Seeker \n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. =\r\ncom \n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, October 07, 2009 9:11 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nHoly Places\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Respected Narsimhaji, \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I would like to=\r\n know your opinion on holy places (famous temples etc) in today&#39;s time.
