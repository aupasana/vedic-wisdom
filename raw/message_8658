Thank you! :)\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com, &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; In his own words Auro=\r\nbindo described his experience of Lord Krishna during his incarceration:\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; It seemed to me that He spoke to me again and said, &quot;The bonds you had n=\r\not the strength to break, I have broken for you, because it is not my will =\r\nnor was it ever my intention that that should continue. I have had another =\r\nthing for you to do and it is for that I have brought you here, to teach yo=\r\nu what you could not learn for yourself and to train you for my work.&quot; Then=\r\n He placed the Gita in my hands. His strength entered into me and I was abl=\r\ne to do the sadhana of the Gita. I was not only to understand intellectuall=\r\ny but to realise what Sri Krishna demanded of Arjuna and what He demands of=\r\n those who aspire to do His work, to be free from repulsion and desire, to =\r\ndo work for Him without the demand for fruit, to renounce self-will and bec=\r\nome a passive and faithful instrument in His hands, to have an equal heart =\r\nfor high and low, friend and opponent, success and failure, yet not to do H=\r\nis work negligently. I realised what the Hindu religion meant. We speak oft=\r\nen of the Hindu religion, of the Sanatan Dharma, but few of us really know =\r\nwhat that religion is. Other religions are preponderatingly religions of fa=\r\nith and profession, but the Sanatan Dharma is life itself; it is a thing th=\r\nat has not so much to be believed as lived. This is the Dharma that for the=\r\n salvation of humanity was cherished in the seclusion of this peninsula fro=\r\nm of old. It is to give this religion that India is rising. She does not ri=\r\nse as other countries do, for self or when she is strong, to trample on the=\r\n weak. She is rising to shed the eternal light entrusted to her over the wo=\r\nrld. India has always existed for humanity and not for herself and it is fo=\r\nr humanity and not for herself that she must be great.\n&gt; \n&gt; Therefore this =\r\nwas the next thing He pointed out to me, =97 He made me realise the central=\r\n truth of the Hindu religion. He turned the hearts of my jailors to me and =\r\nthey spoke to the Englishman in charge of the jail, &quot;He is suffering in his=\r\n confinement; let him at least walk outside his cell for half an hour in th=\r\ne morning and in the evening.&quot; So it was arranged, and it was while I was w=\r\nalking that His strength again entered into me. I looked the jail that secl=\r\nuded me from men and it was no longer by its high walls that I was imprison=\r\ned; no, it was Vasudeva who surrounded me. I walked under the branches of t=\r\nhe tree in front of my cell but it was not the tree, I knew it was Vasudeva=\r\n, it was Sri Krishna whom I saw standing there and holding over me his shad=\r\ne. I looked at the bars of my cell, the very grating that did duty for a do=\r\nor and again I saw Vasudeva. It was Narayana who was guarding and standing =\r\nsentry over me. Or I lay on the coarse blankets that were given me for a co=\r\nuch and felt the arms of Sri Krishna around me, the arms of my Friend and L=\r\nover. This was the first use of the deeper vision He gave me. I looked at t=\r\nhe prisoners in the jail, the thieves, the murderers, the swindlers, and as=\r\n I looked at them I saw Vasudeva, it was Narayana whom I found in these dar=\r\nkened souls and misused bodies. Amongst these thieves and dacoits there wer=\r\ne many who put me to shame by their sympathy, their kindness, the humanity =\r\ntriumphant over such adverse circumstances. One I saw among them especially=\r\n, who seemed to me a saint, a peasant of my nation who did not know how to =\r\nread and write, an alleged dacoit sentenced to ten years&#39; rigorous imprison=\r\nment, one of those whom we look down upon in our Pharisaical pride of class=\r\n as Chhotalok. Once more He spoke to me and said, &quot;Behold the people among =\r\nwhom I have sent you to do a little of my work. This is the nature of the n=\r\nation I am raising up and the reason why I raise them.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; When the case =\r\nopened in the lower court and we were brought before the Magistrate I was f=\r\nollowed by the same insight. He said to me, &quot;When you were cast into jail, =\r\ndid not your heart fail and did you not cry out to me, where is Thy protect=\r\nion ? Look now at the Magistrate, look now at the Prosecuting Counsel.&quot; I l=\r\nooked and it was not the Magistrate whom I saw, it was Vasudeva, it was Nar=\r\nayana who was sitting there on the bench. I looked at the Prosecuting Couns=\r\nel and it was not the Counsel for the prosecution that I saw; it was Sri Kr=\r\nishna who sat there, it was my Lover and Friend who sat there and smiled. &quot;=\r\nNow do you fear ?&quot; He said, &quot;I am in all men and I overrule their actions a=\r\nnd their words. My protection is still with you and you shall not fear. Thi=\r\ns case which is brought against you, leave it in my hand. It is not for you=\r\n. It was not for the trial that I brought you here but for something else. =\r\nThe case itself is only a means for my work and nothing more.&quot; Afterwards w=\r\nhen the trial opened in the Sessions Court, I began to write many instructi=\r\nons for my Counsel as to what was false in the evidence against me and on w=\r\nhat points the witnesses might be cross-examined. Then something happened w=\r\nhich I had not expected. The arrangements which had been made for my defenc=\r\ne were suddenly changed and another Counsel stood there to defend me. He ca=\r\nme unexpectedly, =97 a friend of mine, but I did not know he was coming. Yo=\r\nu have all heard the name of the man who put away from him all other though=\r\nts and abandoned all his practice, who sat up half the night day after day =\r\nfor months and broke his health to save me, =97 Srijut Chittaranjan Das. Wh=\r\nen I saw him, I was satisfied, but I still thought it necessary to write in=\r\nstructions. Then all that was put away from me and I had the message from w=\r\nithin, &quot;This is the man who will save you from the snares put around your f=\r\neet. Put aside those papers. It is not you who will instruct him. I will in=\r\nstruct him.&quot; From that time I did not of myself speak a word to my Counsel =\r\nabout the case or give a single instruction, and if ever I was asked a ques=\r\ntion, I always found that my answer did not help the case. I had left it to=\r\n him and he took it entirely into his hands, with what result you know. I k=\r\nnew all along what He meant for me, for I heard it again and again, always =\r\nI listened to the voice within; &quot;I am guiding, therefore fear not. Turn to =\r\nyour own work for which I have brought you to jail and when you come out, r=\r\nemember never to fear, never to hesitate. Remember that it is I who am doin=\r\ng this, not you nor any other. Therefore whatever clouds may come, whatever=\r\n dangers and sufferings, whatever difficulties, whatever impossibilities, t=\r\nhere is nothing impossible, nothing difficult. I am in the nation and its u=\r\nprising and I am Vasudeva, I am Narayana, and what I will, shall be, not wh=\r\nat others will. What I choose to bring about, no human power can stay.&quot;\n&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n"}}
