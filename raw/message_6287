As Sri Dharma Pravartak=\r\na Acharya explains in this amazingly informative talk, a real brahmana is k=\r\nnown by his inherent qualities of goodness, wisdom, cleanliness, peacefulne=\r\nss, knowledge of the Vedic scriptures, humility, and adherence to Dharma. M=\r\nore, a real brahmana knows Brahman - God. Thus, brahmana initiation is open=\r\n to any man or woman who knows Brahman - regardless of their ethnicity, rac=\r\ne, language, nationality, or any other material factor.  There is no such t=\r\nhing anywhere in the Vedic scriptures as a &quot;caste&quot; brahmana. \n\nSri Acharyaj=\r\ni conclusively explains the nature of a real brahmana with more depth and c=\r\nlarity than has ever been presented by anyone else before.\n\n\nWATCH THE VIDE=\r\nO HERE:\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Dru7tF4YzWPM\n\n\n\nPlease forward thi=\r\ns important video to every sincere spiritual seeker you know. \n\n\nAum Harih =\r\nAum\n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
