The well-known Manu Smriti is the authority for dharma matte=\r\nrs in Satya yuga. Goutama smriti is the authority in Treta yuga. For Kali y=\r\nuga, Parasara is the authority in dharma matters.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; And &quot;Parasara Mad=\r\nhaveeyam&quot; clearly sets out the following:\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; &quot;Compared to a ritual suc=\r\nh as homam performed in one&#39;s name by a PRIEST, a ritual performed in one&#39;s=\r\n name by one&#39;s own disciple is 100 times more powerful; compared to that, a=\r\n ritual performed in one&#39;s name by one&#39;s own progeny is 100 times more powe=\r\nrful; compared to that, a ritual performed by oneself\n&gt;=A0 is 100 times mor=\r\ne powerful.&quot;\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; In other words, a ritual such as homam performed by on=\r\neself is 1,000,000 times more powerful than a ritual performed in one&#39;s nam=\r\ne by a priest!

It is even considered pr=\r\neferable if one calls two such priests instead of one at that time. This is=\r\n how one can have better Chittasuddhi.&nbsp; In case a priest is not availa=\r\nble then of course one can go ahead and do the ceremony oneself and find a =\r\nway for giving the Dana later on to a needy person or to a temple.

The well-known Manu Smriti is the authority =\r\nfor dharma matters in Satya yuga. Goutama smriti is the authority in Treta =\r\nyuga. For Kali yuga, Parasara is the authority in dharma matters.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\nnbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; And &quot;Parasara Madhaveeyam&quot; clearly sets out the following:&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &quot;Compared to a ritual such as homam performed in one&#39;s=\r\n name by a PRIEST, a ritual performed in one&#39;s name by one&#39;s own disciple i=\r\ns 100 times more powerful; compared to that, a ritual performed in one&#39;s na=\r\nme by one&#39;s own progeny is 100 times more\n powerful; compared to that, a ri=\r\ntual performed by oneself&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; is 100 times more powerful.&quot;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; In other words, a ritual such as homam performed by onesel=\r\nf is 1,000,000 times more powerful than a ritual performed in one&#39;s name by=\r\n a priest! THIS is the guideline given for Kali yuga.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; The bottomline is that one is on on=\r\ne&#39;s own as Kali deepens and priests will be limited in their ability to giv=\r\ne a material and spiritual uplift to others.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; All I a=\r\nm doing is to enable anybody interested in doing key rituals by themselves.=\r\n If one has other avenues which one thinks are better, one is free to pursu=\r\ne them!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; I do g=\r\net a lot of emails from people who\n say that they never did any rituals bef=\r\nore or even lit a lamp in their lives, but somehow felt like trying homam, =\r\ndid it for 6&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; months, their life changed so much and they are =\r\nvery thankful. There are such emails from around the world and not just Ind=\r\nia or US or UK.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; I even heard from a few people who w=\r\nere serious alcoholics and were able to leave the habit after starting homa=\r\nm and are so much happier.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Fire is one thing common between various religions. Hindus, Zo=\r\nroastrians, native Americans, Incans, ancient Greco-Romans and even ancient=\r\n Judeo-Christian masters such as Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob and Moses are =\r\nknown to have worshipped &quot;God&quot; in fire and made offerings in fire.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Even if one does not know any rituals or rules, just lightin=\r\ng a fire, imagining God in\n fire and meditating in front of fire can be ver=\r\ny very effective.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&nbsp; In future we will have No Real Brahmins l=\r\neft and all Duplicates&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will abound the earth.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n;&nbsp; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Already there may be very few brahmins on earth, if =\r\none goes by the definition given by Lord Krishna to Uddhava (see Srimad Bha=\r\ngavatam 11.17 http://vedabase.net/sb/11/17/).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; *&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Sir, apart from this thread, I have seen al=\r\nl your threads on me on JyotishGroup in the last 8 days.
