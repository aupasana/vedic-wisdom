You mean the world of Rajarshi? ;-)&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;True. But that is why I use=\r\nd a bit of the future continuous tense in my hopeful assertion:) I don&#39;t th=\r\nink the world at large will let go of the Dasavatara idea anytime soon, how=\r\never the evolutionary link will keep gaining more ground. Already many seem=\r\n to think that way. I was watching a TV program of a\n god-man\n speaking to =\r\nmassive gathering of his followers in an Indian city and he was actually ex=\r\nplaining dasavatara with evolution.\n&gt;\n&gt;Though this thought came to me indep=\r\nendently, I am definitely not the first one, or\n hopefully the last one, wh=\r\no finds an evolutionary link in the story of the Dasavataras. Apparently, i=\r\nt was Sri Aurobindo who first wrote about this.\n&gt;\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;&lt;To give a simplisitc analogy, some jewllery may be g=\r\nold mixed with some \namount of copper. If one jewllery is 100% pure gold, i=\r\nt does not mean it\n contains all the gold in the\n world. It only means it h=\r\nas nothing other than gold. Similarly, the \nfour poornavataras mentioned by=\r\n Parasara are 100% divine and do not \ncontain jivamsa. It does not mean the=\r\ny contain &quot;all the divinity&quot; in \ncosmos.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Very beautiful analogy! Makes=\r\n sense.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;&lt; If no form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being and every form is =\r\na &quot;subset&quot; of \nsupreme being (like a cloud in sky), what is the meaning of =\r\n&quot;swayam \nbhagavan&quot;???&gt;&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Hmm.. the way *I look at it*, the Supreme Being =\r\nis truly Infinite in every sense, yet when it makes a descent into our plan=\r\ne of material life, it assumes a form, a personality and a=C2=A0 character.=\r\n Now based on the need of THAT desh-kaal, it chooses its specific personali=\r\nty and form, which, to the average consciousness of that period seems like =\r\na fantastic achievement, pushing the limits of imagination to the extreme, =\r\nfor that period. And in this light, Krshna is Swayam Bhagawan. As if, if G-=\r\nd were to come down in flesh and blood in fantastic potency for the age tha=\r\nt we are living in - it must have been Krshna with his effortless and match=\r\nless display of the multiple skills, including such extreme Divine feats as=\r\n showing his foster mother the whole universe contained inside his mouth, o=\r\nr making Rishi Markandeya experience the effects of Yogamaya when he saw th=\r\nis great deluge that ended the world and in the middle of those turbulent w=\r\naters, a Divine Child\n was floating in a Banyana-leaf, sucking his own righ=\r\nt toe. When the Child sucked Rishi Markandeya inside him through his breath=\r\n, the Rishi perceived infinite number of universes and planetary systems wi=\r\nthin the body of the Child. \n&gt;\n&gt;Recently I was reading a Tantric scripture.=\r\n Tara Rahashyam. Among ShaktAs, it is a revered scripture. I found somethin=\r\ng interesting. While naturally this being a ShaktA text, the Divine Mother =\r\nin Her various forms are eulogized as Supreme, it also mentions that in Kal=\r\ni, Krshna is Supreme. This explains why only Krshna among the various avata=\r\nrs of Vishnu is worshiped in those parts of India where Tantras were the pr=\r\nedominant scriptures that were followed. Rama is considered as a part of Kr=\r\nshna. So along with Krshna nama, Rama nama japa is also done, though there =\r\nis no exclusive mass worship of Rama in these parts. \n&gt;\n&gt;India has so many\n=\r\n flavors, that it is almost mind boggling.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\nOn many subtle points, your mail was very thought provoking. And I am sure =\r\nI will keep pondering over various hints for quite some time. But one point=\r\n I want to make about Vedanta. I agree totally with you. \n&gt;\n&gt;Vedanta is the=\r\n philosophy, not only of Shankara Adwaitha, but also that of Ramanujacharya=\r\n, Madhavacharya, Chaitanya, Vallavacharya as well as the TantrAs. They are =\r\nall Vedantas.\n&gt;\n&gt;Quite simple put, there are two fundamental states of pure=\r\n consciousness. Static, and dynamic. Purusha and Shakti. The static conscio=\r\nusness is same all around in everything, from the highest Avatara to the lo=\r\nwest stone. But the dynamic aspect of consciousness is NOT same in everythi=\r\nng.\n&gt;\n&gt;Ramakrishna used to say, Kali in present in everyone, but Her Shakti=\r\n is not same in everyone! This crucial point lies in the heart of Tantric V=\r\nedanta philosophy. By the process of sadhana,\n this dynamic aspect of consc=\r\niousness can be enhanced in an individual. This is the eternal purification=\r\n of individual Chit-Shakti. The purer it is, the stronger it becomes. This =\r\nalso accommodates for the idea of vigyana. \n&gt;\n&gt;That is why however much sad=\r\nhana a person may do, he/she will never ever attain to the level of a Rama =\r\nor a Krshna. Its practically impossible. The difference is in their levels =\r\nof individualized chit-shakti. Or that of a Rishi. Their Chit-Shakit is so =\r\npowerful, so pure, so free, that it can identify with the Universe and do t=\r\nhings which are impossible to imagine. Which we cannot. Ever.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;Once aga=\r\nin, wishing everyone a fruitful and auspicious Akshaya Tritiya!\n&gt;\n&gt;-Regards=\r\n\n&gt;=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |=\r\n\n&gt;param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;________________=\r\n________________\n&gt; From: Narasimha P.V.R.

It means a completely divine avatara with no jivamsa. There can be mor=\r\ne than one poornavataras. They are not necessarily &quot;equal&quot;.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;To giv=\r\ne a simplisitc analogy, some jewllery may be gold mixed with some amount of=\r\n\n copper. If one jewllery is 100% pure gold, it\n does not mean\n it contains=\r\n all the gold in the\n world. It only means it has nothing other than gold. =\r\nSimilarly, the four poornavataras mentioned by Parasara are 100% divine and=\r\n do not contain jivamsa. It does not mean they contain &quot;all the divinity&quot; i=\r\nn cosmos.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;In fact, the very notion that =\r\nany one form can be &quot;the most complete or perfect avatara&quot; or &quot;one that per=\r\nsonifies entire divinity of Supreme Being&quot; or &quot;one equal to Supreme Being&quot; =\r\nis unacceptable and inconsistent with SB 1.3.30-31, which says that ANY for=\r\nm of Supreme Being is like a cloud in the sky, while Supreme Being is like =\r\nthe sky containing all possible clouds.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Supreme Being is endowed w=\r\nith infinite qualities. Any form contains a finite number of those qualitie=\r\ns. So no form can be &quot;equal to&quot; Supreme Being. SB 1.3.30-31 is clear in tha=\r\nt regard.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;If one\n form is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being and others are\n=\r\n not, you can conclude that that form is &quot;the best&quot;. If neither form is &quot;eq=\r\nual to&quot; supreme being, how can you really compare the different qualities o=\r\nf two forms?\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Anyway, this renders your (=\r\n3) a meaningless issue. Whether that line refers to Krishna alone or not is=\r\n irrelevant, for, in either case, &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot; cannot mean &quot;a personif=\r\nication of the entirety of supreme being&quot;. Before you wonder whether it ref=\r\ners to Krishna alone or not, first figure out what &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot; actual=\r\nly means, in a way that is not inconsistent with verses that follow! If no =\r\nform is &quot;equal to&quot; supreme being and every form is a &quot;subset&quot; of supreme be=\r\ning (like a cloud in sky), what is the meaning of &quot;swayam bhagavan&quot;???\n&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0\n *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Regarding (4), Parasara\n identified 4 avatara=\r\ns as 100% divine, with no jivamsa, and identified the source of divinity in=\r\n each of them. He only gave objective information and did not give any subj=\r\nective judgment on who is the best, which Suta apparently did.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;I h=\r\nave not read BV Purana. If you can quote some verses before and after, I ca=\r\nn comment. Any comparison between avataras WILL have to be under some subje=\r\nctive context. I don&#39;t know the context of Suta&#39;s statement you allude to.\n=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Though any comparison is subjective, I will be surprised if someon=\r\ne considers the other two poornavataras of Vishnu as the &quot;best&quot; avataras. B=\r\nut, I will not be surprised if different people consider Rama and Krishna a=\r\ns the most perfect avataras. Sun and Moon are the luminaries and show soul =\r\nand mind, which clearly have a primary significance compared to other aspec=\r\nts of consciousness! So Rama and Krishna are bound to be seen as the best b=\r\ny different people.\n However, what Suta\n apparently said can only be a subj=\r\nective view under some context.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Regarding =\r\n(2): Kala means a part or a phase. Moon has 16 phases (representing 16 tith=\r\nis, including Amavasya and Pournima), but Sun has only one phase - he is al=\r\nways full and bright!\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Just like Moon, mind has many moods, even a =\r\nperfected one. A perfected mind goes through those moods with full awarenes=\r\ns of underlying reality, whereas an imperfect mind experiences them under d=\r\nelusion. But it is the nature of Moon/mind to have variations. Sun/soul OTO=\r\nH has no such variations.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Krishna may show Vishwaroopa oneday, run=\r\n away from battlefield another day (e.g. Jarasandha), do amazing miracles o=\r\nneday and play clever tricks another day. There is a lot more variety to hi=\r\ns personality than Rama&#39;s. Now, does that make him better or worse than Ram=\r\na? Well, that\n is\n a *subjective* matter.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;Regarding (1): Parasara said that paramatmamsa is present in several bein=\r\ngs such a planets, Brahma, Shiva, their consorts, etc. Grahas sustain the w=\r\norld appearance in consciousness by grasping it based on karmaphala. So the=\r\ny stand for different qualities of Vishnu that sustain the world appearance=\r\n. So Vishnu&#39;s avataras are associated with grahas. But Pararsara said that =\r\navataras can descend from the paramatmamsa present in several other beings =\r\n(e.g. Shiva, Parvati, Ashwins, Maruts etc). Unfortunately, we have meagre u=\r\nnderstanding what various deities stand for, what forces play a role in cre=\r\nating, sustaining and destroying the world appearance in consciousness. Peo=\r\nple talk too much about Vedanta (end of Veda) and there is hardly any under=\r\nstanding of Veda. When it comes to Puranic stories, we think in terms of\n s=\r\nuperficial stories and not in terms of how it maps to what happens in consc=\r\niousness.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Mohini was an avatara of Vishnu + Maheshwari. Nara & Nar=\r\nayana were incarnations of Narayana (i.e. Brahma + Vishnu + Shiva). I don&#39;t=\r\n know about Dhanvantari and will pass for today. Dattatreya again was an in=\r\ncarnation of Shiva + Vishnu + Brahma. Balarama is an incarnation of great s=\r\nerpent Adi Sesha (like Lakshmana).\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;We need to go deeper into what =\r\nthey all stand for esoterically and what role they play in the functioning =\r\nof consciousness, to understand this more.

All of them are mentioned as Avataras of the Supreme Bei=\r\nng in SB.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;2. What is your opinion about the general stated idea that o=\r\nnly Krshna is 16 kala-poorna and others are not?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;3. That the SB mentio=\r\nns Krshna as Swayam Bhagwan ONLY with respect to the previous sloka where i=\r\nt says that all rishis, munis etc are also Avataras, is one interpretation,=\r\n and not too popular at that. OTOH, most of the great commentators, and the=\r\ny were no less in their\n spiritual merit\n or intellectual prowess have take=\r\nn that specific verse to mean Krshna to be greater than ALL Avataras. The v=\r\nerse itself does not mention that it is with respect to the previous verse,=\r\n or with respect to all the 17 verses that precede it, which lists all Avat=\r\naras. So it boils down to interpretation based on individual conditioning. =\r\nIt seems Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, Vallavacharya, Nimbarka, etc all shared a si=\r\nmilar conditioning which made them read that verse to mean that only Krshna=\r\n is Swayam Bhagwan. Would you agree to this conclusion? :) \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;4. Apparen=\r\ntly in the Brahma Vaivarta Purana, Suta tells the Rishis of Naimisharanya t=\r\nhat Krshna is greatest Avatara of them all. So, how do we resolve this appa=\r\nrent conflict between what Rishi Parashara states and what this Purana stat=\r\nes?

I am just doing a thinking aloud here. Feel f=\r\nree to disagree :)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Firstly, I feel, the conception of colloq=\r\nuially used=C2=A0term=C2=A0Bhagawan as a Superman with unlimited potentials=\r\n way beyond what any normal human being can achieve, came into existence fr=\r\nom the Vaishnava schools of Kali Yuga, who looked at Krshna as the ultimate=\r\n God=C2=A0on earth. It is difficult to miss the phonetic=C2=A0similarity be=\r\ntween terms Bhagawata and Bhagawana. The Bhagawata religion started from th=\r\ne Gita and a contemplation of the life of Krshna. All the major purely=C2=\r\n=A0Vaishnava Acharyas - Ramanujacharya, Madhavacharya, Vallavacharya, Nimba=\r\nrka, Sri Chaitanya=C2=A0as well as the nava-naths (Dhaneshwari was the earl=\r\niest known non-sanskrit translation of the Gita) - considered, (with differ=\r\ning nuances on the=C2=A0relation between jiva, paramatma, moksha=C2=A0etc),=\r\n Krshna as the ultimate conception of God on earth. This was aided in no le=\r\nss a measure by the delcaration of the earliest Puranas, that is Vishnu Pur=\r\nana and the SB, that Krshna was a complete Avatara. Some,\n like the Gaudiya=\r\n Vaishnavas, went one step ahead and took a very literal view of it all and=\r\n declared Krshna as the Ultimate Being, and the formless Paramatma, as well=\r\n as Narayana,=C2=A0as merely=C2=A0the aura of Krshna. Rama was also intrica=\r\ntely linked to this Krshnaa-ism, but was looked at as the earlier brith of =\r\nKrshna, not as a separate Divity in himself.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Whatever the ca=\r\nse maybe, each school had its own set of established saints and scholars to=\r\n vouch for their views. So it boiled down to interpretation, which is often=\r\n, as you rightly pointed out, based on=C2=A0various conditionings.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;We=C2=A0human beings are creatures of imagination. Whenever an Avat=\r\nar appears on the earth,=C2=A0most of the great Mahatmas who appear after t=\r\nhe Avatara, remain=C2=A0overawed by the=C2=A0character of the last Avatara=\r\n=C2=A0because invariable in the context of the desh-kaal-patra of those tim=\r\nes, the life of the Avatara shows actions performed which are=C2=A0way beyo=\r\nnd=C2=A0imagination for *those times*. Such a situation continues until the=\r\n next Avatara comes on earth. I am sure in the period after Rama, and befor=\r\ne Krshna, of which we have very little written record, the world at large r=\r\nemained entirely overawed by Rama Avatara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In this light Krs=\r\nhna is the Poorna-Avatara. When Kalki will appear on earth, he will be inva=\r\nrible accompanied by a set of powerful Rishis - every Avatara comes with hi=\r\ns coterie of Rishis who explain the philosophy and spirituality of the Avat=\r\nara to the general masses - who will then create new scriptures and Kalki w=\r\nill be looked at as the crest jewel=C2=A0of the Avataras.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I believe in the evolutionary parable=\r\n of these 9 Avatara because I find no other reason why these set of Avatara=\r\n, from the whole list of possible=C2=A0Avataras, have captured the popular =\r\nimagination. I mean Dattatreya is an Avatara too as per SB. His spiritualit=\r\ny is no less than that of any other Avatara. Yet, he is not in the list of =\r\n9/10 Avataras. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The=C2=A0original Nath Yogis used to conside=\r\nr=C2=A0Nine Chakras in the Human Body. The idea of Kundalini Yoga also came=\r\n from them, which was basically exploring=C2=A0cronologically all these nin=\r\ne chakras one after the other by flooding them with Chit-Shakti.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;There are 9 basic grahas in jyotish. Each graha could very well=C2=A0r=\r\nepresent the essential nature of each chakra. All these make me more sangui=\r\nne that there must be Nine Evolutionary Avataras, not ten. In which case Ka=\r\nlki must be the Ninth Avatara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Buddha, as you rightly pointe=\r\nd out,=C2=A0has a tremendous logical appeal in Kali Yuga. But if logic is t=\r\nhe criteria, then why not Adi Shankara? I may not agree to=C2=A0his philoso=\r\nphy as it comes down to us from his followers, but it cannot be denied that=\r\n=C2=A0Adi Shankara was=C2=A0arguable one of the sharpest and most logical o=\r\nf spiritual philosphers. His intellectual and logical mind=C2=A0is beyond d=\r\noubt.=C2=A0Just that Shankara=C2=A0never claimed himself to be an Avatara. =\r\nNeither did=C2=A0Siddhartha. Only that the later came 3000 years ago, and t=\r\nhe former came possibly in the last 1000 years.=C2=A0Shankara&#39;s spiritual i=\r\nmpact on the world is no less than that of the=C2=A0Buddha. What mainstream=\r\n=C2=A0Hinduism today is, could not have been, had it not been for the inval=\r\nuable contribution of Adi Shankara. And if Buddha was truly=C2=A0the awaite=\r\nd=C2=A09th Avatara of Vishnu, Shankara would not have been able to absorb t=\r\nhe philosophy of Buddha into Hinduism and thus make it lose its grip on Ind=\r\nia. Buddhism\n barely exists in land of its birth.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All this t=\r\naken together, make me more and more convinced that there are 9 evolutionar=\r\ny Avataras and the 9th is yet to come.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0 *=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;A little bit about Rama and Krshna. When I said I admire Rama, =\r\nit is not a lip-service. There are incidents in the Ramayana which I find e=\r\nxtremely inspiring, educative and uplifting. Like the incident where Rama w=\r\nas to cross the ocean. Rama knew very well that if he wanted, in one moment=\r\n he could have used his Divine Astras and forced the ocean to yield way to =\r\nhis army. Yet he sat in silent supplication for days, praying that the ocea=\r\nn allow his army safe passage. When all else failed, when genuine goodwill =\r\nwas not recirpocated, and it was absolutely necessary to cross the ocean,=\r\n=C2=A0THEN=C2=A0Rama took up weapons to get the job done.=C2=A0A powerful w=\r\narrior,=C2=A0who knows=C2=A0very well how=C2=A0powerful he=C2=A0himself is,=\r\n not letting that sense of power pervert his mind even for a moment is an a=\r\nmazing phenomenon. This kind of self-control is rare and worthy of comtempl=\r\nation, specially by anyone who feels, ever so slightly, that he/she has som=\r\ne form of power or influence in\n this world in any sphere.=C2=A0Rama had no=\r\n malice for anyone. Not even Ravana, by the end of the war at least. He was=\r\n the very personification of Satwa. In Satwa, conflict and malice and cunni=\r\nngness are impossible.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Recently, a friend of mine told me th=\r\nat he has learnt all his life that one must listen to Krshna&#39;s advice, but =\r\nonly follow what Rama did, and not what Krshna did. I disagree with this ve=\r\nhemently. If one reads entire Krshna&#39;s life=C2=A0with an objective mind, Kr=\r\nshna of Vrndavana, Krshna of Mathura, Krshna of Kurushetra, Krshna the Jaga=\r\nt Guru who speaks the Gita, one will find that what Krshna the Guru adviced=\r\n in the Gita,=C2=A0Krshna the=C2=A0Divine Worker=C2=A0himself followed it a=\r\nll through his life at every instance. It is his=C2=A0perfect detachment un=\r\nder all circumstances of life, from childhood=C2=A0to his death,=C2=A0that =\r\nmakes me wonder, was this a man or was this a God? Can a man even do someth=\r\ning like this? It is as if there is a part of Krshna who is always separate=\r\n from everything, and silently watches the whole scene with a bemused smile=\r\n. He had not a single personal stake in the Mahabharata. Rama at least had =\r\nhis wife abducted for him to start a war against\n Ravana. But Krshna had ze=\r\nro=C2=A0personal stake in the Mahabharata.=C2=A0After liberating his parent=\r\ns from Kamsa, very soon he went off to meet the Pandavas. From out of nowhe=\r\nre he forced himself into the politics of the Mahabharata, and precipitated=\r\n a great war to cleanse the world of burden. While Lakshmana devoutly follo=\r\nwed Rama all along the Ramayana and they were like an inseparable pair, as=\r\n=C2=A0Balarama in his next incarnation=C2=A0he could=C2=A0hardly understand=\r\n Krshna. There are so many occassions where Balarama asks Krshna, what are =\r\nthey doing with all these kings, and=C2=A0that they should=C2=A0return to t=\r\nheir village in Vrndavana. Krshna merely smiles. He knows that not everyone=\r\n will understand everything. But that cannot stop him from following his dh=\r\narma, with perfect detachement from eveyrthing of this plane. Neither false=\r\n praises, nor wrong accusations by his close people can affect him one bit.=\r\n And I am not even counting the miracles he perfromed as a Divine\n Child. S=\r\no I worship Krshna, because I have not yet met or heard of read of=C2=A0a s=\r\ningle sadhaka or saint or ordinary man or mahatma=C2=A0who has displayed th=\r\nis kind of perfected detachment through thick and thin, yet not withdrawing=\r\n from the world or actively performing a larger dharma.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I st=\r\narted appreciating Swami Vivekanada more after I understood a bit of the Kr=\r\nshna Avatara. That was the last known saint who lived a whirlwind life in t=\r\nhe middle of a circus-stoplight of fame and accusations, on one side adorin=\r\ng admirers and on the other bitter enemies accusing him of=C2=A0being a her=\r\netic=C2=A0right upto the=C2=A0very end of his brief life,=C2=A0and yet none=\r\n of that affected him to any great degree. He faced terrific racism in the =\r\nAmerica, yet not a single speech of his reflects the slightest trace of bit=\r\nterness, anger, or negativity. That is such a fantastic achievement, IMHO.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I agree with you, Narasimha, for most of us it is better to=\r\n=C2=A0try to=C2=A0mould ones life=C2=A0with the same kind of supreme selfle=\r\nssness that Rama showed all along.=C2=A0Not just worship Rama=C2=A0but more=\r\n importantly study=C2=A0his life and imbibe,=C2=A0to whatever degree possib=\r\nle, the quality he represented.=C2=A0Maybe, just maybe, then the Unmanifest=\r\ned Reality - Shiva - will fix the mind so firmly on that Reality, that in s=\r\nome future life, in some later birth, one will be able to live life like Kr=\r\nshna showed, unattached and unaffected by any dirt that the world throws up=\r\n.

If people at the beginning of Satya yuga are est=\r\nablished in Self always and the only issue is that a small attachment may d=\r\nevelop now and then, disturbing that state of being established in Self (i.=\r\ne. stealing of Veda!), then the aspect of consciousness that is relevant is=\r\n &quot;spirit of detachment&quot; (Ketu). If invoked, it removes that attachment and =\r\ntakes one back to being established in Self. So an avatara corresponding to=\r\n Ketu occurred.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As collective consciousness became denser, b=\r\neing established in Self became less natural and more effort was needed. So=\r\n the\n &quot;spirit of patience, persistence and\n hard-work&quot; (Saturn) became rele=\r\nvant and an avatara corresponding to Saturn occurred. And so on.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;In the dark ages of Kali yuga, rational minds wouldn&#39;t accept anything=\r\n that didn&#39;t &quot;make sense&quot;. Being established in Self became an unnatural, r=\r\nidiculous and incomprehensible notion. So the &quot;spirit of comprehension&quot; (Me=\r\nrcury) became relevant. An avatara corresponding to Mercury occurred and tr=\r\nied to explain being established in Self as a comprehensible notion, so tha=\r\nt rational minds of that age would accept it to an extent and attempt it.\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Avataras occur based on the needs of collective consciousness=\r\n. Of course, if one&#39;s consciousness is in a different state from the collec=\r\ntive consciousness of that time, the current avatara may not be relevant to=\r\n one.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; I respect Rama, but I\n=\r\n worship Krshna.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am\n awestruck by Krishna and worship him,=\r\n but I see Rama as an ideal that I MAY be able to emulate oneday.

It lists 22 Avataras!=\r\n It=C2=A0deals with the idea of Avataran, but not with the idea of 9/10 fix=\r\ned Avataras.=C2=A0It also=C2=A0lists Varaha Avatara as the 2nd Avatara, and=\r\n Matsya as the 10 in its list of 22. It is only in other puranas, that we g=\r\net the focus on 10 Avatars, and the term becomes popular. \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;And ONLY when we take these 9/10 Avataras, in a fixed sequence=C2=A0of app=\r\nearence, that we get the popular concept of Dasavatara. Else no. I find the=\r\n evolutionary link in this concept of 9/10 Avataras too compelling to be ig=\r\nnored.=C2=A0=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;After all, &quot;entire divinity&quot; cannot b=\r\ne encapsulated by any form&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;This, I am in total agreement=\r\n with. Infact, in the 10th Chapter of Gita when the Supreme explains the va=\r\nrious vibhutis, this One is not even Krshna, but has transcended every limi=\r\ntation of conception. Hence, the One says, among those who weild weapons, i=\r\nt is Rama, and among the Vrishnis it is Krshna! Etc..\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;&lt;Fi=\r\nrst, he IS mentioned in SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If =\r\nhe does not &quot;fit&quot; in your &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your conce=\r\npt is possibly wrong and avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you the=\r\norize.&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;As I said, the SB list contains 22 Avataras. It does no=\r\nt focus on the idea of 9/10 Avataras! That is my point. If you take 22 Avat=\r\naras, then these link to grahas are not of any use. For these nine grahas, =\r\nindividually or in combination, will represent all Avataras, or for that ma=\r\ntter everything else in this Universe.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, if we tak=\r\ne 10 Avatars and corresponding grahas for each, then what must Kalki be? La=\r\ngna? But=C2=A0lagna is not a graha.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Or, just surmising, ca=\r\nn it be possible that until an Avatara actually descends on the earth, his =\r\nenergy and his force cannot be attributed to any graha, but once he does ap=\r\npear, it reconfigures things completely? We can only know after the last Av=\r\natara comes.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Anyway, I am not looking at this main Avatars=\r\n from the point of grahas/jyotish at all.

In fact, Parasara, fa=\r\nther of Vyasa, explicitly mentioned that Rama, Krishna, Narasimha and Varah=\r\na are &quot;poornavataras&quot; (used that exact expression) while other avataras hav=\r\ne some amount of jivatmamsa too\n (though paramatmamsa dominates\n jivatmamsa=\r\n).\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Secondly, after describing the avataras, SB says that t=\r\nhere are in fact innumerable avataras and that all rishis, munis, manus, de=\r\nmigods etc are avataras of Supreme Lord. It is under THAT context that 1.3.=\r\n28 then proceeds to say &quot;these avataras are partial, while Krishna is Lord =\r\nHimself.&quot; I question if the deduction that Krishna *alone* is Lord Himself =\r\nand Rama is not is accurate! It only seems to say that all these rishis, ma=\r\nnus, demigods etc are partial. As I said above, Pararsara explicitly said t=\r\nhat both Rama and Krishna are poornavataras.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Third, let us=\r\n ask a very fundamental question: What exactly does it mean if an avatara i=\r\ns &quot;Lord Himself&quot;?\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;While SB=\r\n talks of Krishna being &quot;Lord Himself&quot; in 1.3.28, it also says in 1.3.30: &quot;=\r\nforms of Supreme Lord, who is in\n reality formless (arUpa) and of the\n natu=\r\nre of pure consciousness (chidAtman), are manufactured by the qualities of =\r\nMaya&quot;. In the next verse, it further compares forms of Lord to clouds in sk=\r\ny and dirt in air. Just as sky *contains* clouds and is beyond them, simila=\r\nrly Lord *contains* forms and is beyond them. So, again, what is the meanin=\r\ng of a specific form that descended on earth being &quot;Lord Himself&quot;? I am afr=\r\naid people may be misinterpreting this notion based on their fancies and co=\r\nnditioning..\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;All beings are made up of paramatma (supreme/=\r\nabsolute being) and jivatma (living/relative being). The latter portion is =\r\ndominant in us and is responsible for desires and rebirth. Great avataras d=\r\nescend from a higher portion of paramatma. Very rarely avataras descend ent=\r\nirely from paramatma without ANY jivatma portion. Rama and Krishna are spec=\r\nific examples given by Parasara.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;They are entirely divine,=\r\n but they do not encapsulate the entire divinity!!!!\n After all, &quot;entire\n d=\r\nivinity&quot; cannot be encapsulated by any form just as no cloud can contain th=\r\ne entire sky.

His\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; realization, the one he advocated, is a static reali=\r\nzation,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; an end in a void.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;First, he IS mentioned in=\r\n SB list of avataras as well as Parasara&#39;s list. If he does not &quot;fit&quot; in yo=\r\nur &quot;scheme of evolutionary Avatars&quot;, then your concept is possibly wrong an=\r\nd avataras are perhaps not &quot;evolutionary&quot; as you theorize.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;Secondly, as per Parasara, Buddha corresponds to Mercury, who personifies =\r\nlogical mind and the spirit of\n investigation and comprehension. Logical mi=\r\nnd\n and its spirit of comprehension are inherently fallible. Even a perfect=\r\ned spirit of comprehension is not capable of grasping the Absolute Reality =\r\ncompletely, for it is beyond comprehension. So, no wonder it simplifies the=\r\n Incomprehensible in an attempt to comprehend! That is what Buddha ended up=\r\n doing. However, logical mind has a great appeal in the Age of Reason in th=\r\nis Kali yuga. No wonder Buddha was/is/will be a great spiritual force in th=\r\nis world in this age.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If=\r\n you dismiss Parasara&#39;s linking of planets to avataras as a possible corrup=\r\ntion, are you absolutely sure that the verses of SB you are relying on are =\r\nperfect? (In any case, it&#39;s a different matter that you are only taking som=\r\ne SB verses and ignoring\n some as\n I\n showed!.)\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;The bottom=\r\nline as far as I am concerned is that Pararsara&#39;s list actually makes amazi=\r\nngly coherent esoteric sense. The nature of each aspect of consciousness (e=\r\n.g. Buddha - spirit of comprehension, Saturn - spirit of patience & persist=\r\nence, Venus - spirit of happiness etc) and the story of corresponding avata=\r\nra DOES have a highly meaningful connection, esoterically speaking. After a=\r\nll, esoterically is how you really need to understand any higher scriptures=\r\n and notions in them.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we take scriptures literally inst=\r\nead and draw lopsided conclusions, some would conclude that Shiva is the &quot;s=\r\nupreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; some would conclude that Sury=\r\na is the &quot;supreme&quot; one and other deities are &quot;inferior&quot;; and so on.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;On a different note, someone\n m=\r\nay think that Kali, being Aadyaa, is superior\n to Tara and like Kali more. =\r\nBut, some learned yogis have declared them to be essentially the same and s=\r\nome scriptures even prohibited differentiating between them. As I see it, t=\r\nhe difference between them is too subtle for even rishis to clearly compreh=\r\nend. People seeing some significant difference between them are, I am afrai=\r\nd, merely projecting their own conditioning. Same in the case of Krishna an=\r\nd Rama. Both were=C2=A0 perfectly detached and fully divine karma yogis.\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;If we think about it, perfected mind (paramatma aspect repre=\r\nsented by Moon) and soul (paramatma aspect represented by Sun) are not real=\r\nly that different. So I am afraid Krishna and Rama are not that different, =\r\nthough the specifics of their stories may be different.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;On=\r\ne last word though. If someone truly believes that Krishna is superior to R=\r\nama and worships Krishna (or vice versa!), I am very happy for such a perso=\r\nn. My arguments are more for the sake of sharing thinking/knowledge and pus=\r\nhing the boundaries of understanding in the long run, than changing the min=\r\nds of anyone in the short run. In the end, everyone of us will have to go t=\r\nhrough one&#39;s own cycles of various tamasik, rajasik and saattwik stages of =\r\nevolution before one starts grasping some fistfuls of Reality. These concep=\r\nts are too subtle for anyone to convince others or be absolutely confident =\r\noneself!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Krishnarpanamastu, Narasimha -------- Astrology &=\r\n Spirituality Resources: http://www.vedicastrologer.org/\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;--------\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;To: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\nSent: Saturday, May 4, 2013 7:34 AM\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Compa=\r\nring Dasavataras!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Namaste,\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;Jai Ma!\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I have a different view poi=\r\nnt. Let me write down as I see it, in point by point manner.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;1. In the Bhagwata Purana, there are a list of 22 Avataras of Vishnu.=\r\n In this list of 22, Varaha Avatara is the 2nd Avatara, and Matsya is the 1=\r\n0th Avatara. Dattatreya, Nara-narayana,Vyasa Deva himself are in this list,=\r\n and then the Bhagawata Purana goes ontu mention that the Avatars of Vishnu=\r\n are innumerable. In the 10th Canto, Vyasa says all these Avatars, and innu=\r\nmerable others, are amsas of the Supreme Being while Krshna is &quot;swayam Bhag=\r\nawan.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;2. Of these various possible Avataras, 10, or ra=\r\nther 9 as I believe, are/have been accorded special mention and significanc=\r\ne across various Hindu spiritual literature, specially those which were com=\r\nposed in the Kali-Yuga, namely the Puranas.[When Krshna was alive, it was K=\r\nali-Sandhya, his physical presence had curtailed the full effect of Kali,on=\r\nce he left his body, Kali started in full flow. All Puranas were composed a=\r\nfter this, hence these are scriptures of the Kali-Yuga, as are Tantras]\n&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;3. These 10/9 Avataras have a fixed sequence of appearance=\r\n. Matysa, Kurma, Varaha, Narasimha, Vamana, Parashurama, Rama, Krshna, (Bud=\r\ndha) and Kalki. There is an unmistakeable connection of the form and sequen=\r\nce of these main avatars with the evolution of life on earth. From the aqua=\r\ntic, to the amphibian, to the land-animal, to the half-animal-half-man, to =\r\nthe dwarf man (first human life form who immediately takes possession of th=\r\nis earth represented by Vamana&#39;s 3 steps), to the Rajashik avatara of Paras=\r\nhurama moving around with an axe, to the Sattwa Guna Avatara of Rama, to th=\r\ne Nirguna Avatara of Krshna. Also, this indicates that spirituality is not =\r\nto be separated into another world, but is a progressive realization of the=\r\n various manifestation and potentials that lie inherent in the consciousnes=\r\ns and its development through various life-forms. Larger spirituality of ea=\r\nrth and evolution go hand in hand. That is Nature&#39;s grand design for life o=\r\nn\n earth.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;4. In this specifc context, I am only focusin=\r\ng on the parable of these main 9/10 Avatars. It is not my contention that i=\r\nf one worships say Matysa Avatara, one will not attain to a state of libera=\r\ntion of the soul. As is the nature of spiritual cosmology in Hinduism, any =\r\nDevata can lead a person to any depth of realization. And each one of the A=\r\nvatars of Vishnu are self-realized in their own way and can be consider sup=\r\ner-massive spiritual dynamos.\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;=C2=A05. Of these,=\r\n naturally, Rama and Krshna are most adored because they represent a stage =\r\nof evolution, both inside as well as outside, which society can relate of m=\r\nuch easier, in this age. Rama represents, for me, the stage of most satwic =\r\nmind. A satwic mind is in control of itself. It known how to transform the =\r\nanimal tendencies within and without - monkeys - into a constructive force =\r\nfor a greater purpose. However, as with a state of full Sattwa Guna, there =\r\ncan be instances, even though few, of dejection. For it is static in nature=\r\n and will change only when circumstances force it to. As per the Valmiki Ra=\r\nmayana, Rama did feel dejected while searching for Sita in the forest. He d=\r\nid have a moments fear before the final assault on Ravana, which was dispel=\r\nled by Agsatha when the later revealed the stotra of the Sun to Rama. At th=\r\ne end of the final battle, Rama tells Sita, in a most dispassionate manner,=\r\n that he killed Ravana not to rescue her, but it\n was the Dharma to do so, =\r\nand to unhold his family honour. That too was the dharma of that age when h=\r\ne lived, family honor. The way I look at this grand epic, and I bow humbly =\r\nto the genius of Rishis Valmiki for representing the things as they are, as=\r\n a scribe, as a poet, as an observer, and not adding his own preferences to=\r\n it anywhere, in the 14 years of tribulation that Rama faced which culminat=\r\ned into his killing Ravana, he changed into the most dispassionate leader, =\r\nsuch that no personal consideration or emotions or passions can overturn th=\r\ne Rajadharma. His life is a lesson of what a true leader must be! Krshna, O=\r\nTOH, had this immaculate detachment right from birth. I am not taking his=\r\n=C2=A0 supernatural feats into account. It is his singular and constant det=\r\nachment from situations, from people, from environment, from circumstances =\r\nthat mark his life. At the age of eight, he decides to leave Vrindavana for=\r\n Mathura. All his friends, his foster parents,\n his village-folks who so lo=\r\nved him, pleaded with him that it would make no sense for him to leave the =\r\nshelter, love and comfort of his happy, settled village life and head into =\r\nan unknown destiny and destination. Krshna tried to reason with them, then =\r\nhe understood that they won&#39;t understand, he promised he will return back o=\r\nnce his work in Mathura is over. He never returned. Later, much later, when=\r\n the Gopis came to him asking him to participate in their dance, he obliged=\r\n. But the moment some of them started getting jealous and possessive of Krs=\r\nhna, he removed himself quietly from the scene, saying that he belongs to e=\r\nveryone equally and no one has any special right over him. When Shishupala =\r\nabused Krshna, the later merely kept dropping flowers on the floor, smiling=\r\n and counting. The moment the 100th abuse was over, he swiftly cut off Shis=\r\nhupala&#39;s head and was back into his poise. But when Bhurishrava unfairly ac=\r\ncused Krshna of being a revolutionist\n and charlatan, Krshna did not kill h=\r\nim. When Duryodhana, who used to think of Krshna as another black magician,=\r\n wanted to arrest him, Krshna showed his vikarala roopa in the assembly of =\r\nkings, yet he did not finish the enemies off. The very next moment he was b=\r\nack into his own poised self. Never in the whole Mahabharata is there one i=\r\nnstance of his going overboard, never a single shade of depression, equivoc=\r\nation, or lack of confidence in his actions, irrespective of what others sa=\r\ny or think of him. And then right in the middle of the greatest war he had =\r\nthe perfect equipoise to deliver the most sublime spiritual philosophy. Tha=\r\nt is why his life remains the best ideal of Karma-Yoga. For a true Karma-Yo=\r\ngi by definition can never be dejected. It is impossible. Neither the actio=\r\nn nor the results belong to the instrument. When running away from the batt=\r\nle-field and killing Kaliya Yavana, or when advising Bheema to tear apart J=\r\narashanda, or gesturing Bheema\n to hit Duryodhana below the waist, or getti=\r\nng Shikhandi to face Bhisma, Krshna, as if by some Divine Intuition, knew e=\r\nxactly how the situations must be lined up which would cause the destructio=\r\nn of these people. This kind of knowledge cannot come by the rational think=\r\ning. But happens when one is constantly and consciously connected to the Un=\r\niversal Force. We do not find these kind of complex situations in the Rama =\r\nAvatara, at least in the Valmiki Ramayana. Of course, if we take the Adhbut=\r\n Ramayana or such other auxilliary texts and retelling, we get a different =\r\npicture. In the Adbhuta Ramayana we have a 1000 headed demon attacking Rama=\r\n after he kills Ravana, and then Sita turns into Adya Shakti and demolishes=\r\n the 1000 headed demon and Rama worships her. But if we take only the Ramay=\r\nana and the Mahabharata, the picture that emerges is very clear. Rama is th=\r\ne embodiment of Sattwic mind. Therefore he displays all the great character=\r\nistics of satwa, chief\n of which is self-control, as well as the occasional=\r\n sadness caused due to separation from his wife Sita whom, at least until R=\r\navana was destroyed, he loved very dearly. Satwa guna creates a true saint,=\r\n but can also cause some grief when the stability is shaken. Krshna wa\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
