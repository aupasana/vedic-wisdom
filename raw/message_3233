Maybe you can share with him the wisdom about vegetarianism found in=\r\n these books!\n\nFrom a religious/spiritual perspective:\nFood for the Gods by=\r\n Rynn Berry\n\nHere is a review of the book\nhttp://www.vegsource.com/berry/fo=\r\nodgods.html\n\nFrom a secular/ethical perspective:\nEating Animals by Jonathan=\r\n Safran Foer\n\nHere is the website for the book\nhttp://eatinganimals.com/\n\nT=\r\nhese are very well researched and documented books and the websites also ha=\r\nve excellent links for your friend to explore.\n\nIf your friend prefers vide=\r\no to the written material, here is an website to jolt him to the reality of=\r\n his choices. BTW, I think this website also might be the one that the Utpa=\r\nl&#39;s German acquaintance might have seen.\n\nhttp://veg-tv.info/Main_Page\n\nSor=\r\nry, this does not answer your question directly but I hope it helps.\n\nbest =\r\nwishes,\nChandraprakash\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Astro Seeker &lt;=\r\nastro.seeker@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a firm believer of Veg bein=\r\ng satwik food and consider non-veg as hurdle to spiritual growth. But, a fr=\r\niend of mine who otherwise is trying to make some spiritual progress, is a =\r\nnon-vegetatian. In our arguments over non-veg food, he has put a counter ar=\r\ngument. He says that if I can find him a single shloka on this in Bhagwat G=\r\neeta, he would give up.=A0\n&gt; So, if anybody on this group can help me find =\r\nthe quote, it would be great. He considers Geeta as the absolute reference =\r\nand believes if Lord Krishna has not spoken about it in Geeta, it is actual=\r\nly not worth discussing whether or not you take non-veg. If anyone finds it=\r\n, le me know so that 1 guy on this earth can become vegetarian.\n&gt; He also q=\r\nuotes Sai Baba, Jesus and Mohammed Prophet adhering to non-veg. If any of y=\r\nou know the counter argument, please help.\n&gt; Best Regards,Sriram\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n    The INTERNET now has a personality. YOURS! See your Yahoo!
