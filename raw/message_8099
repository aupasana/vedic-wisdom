I have a few more things t=\r\no ask you.\n\n1) Right after digbandhah, for some Gods like Hanumana, Sani et=\r\nc. there is a small &#39;dhyanam&#39; part. I was wondering whether I should recite=\r\n this loudly too, or just say this part inside my mind and meditate? (As it=\r\n says &#39;Dhyanam&#39;) But there is no different instructions given. \n\nI am sorry=\r\n to ask so many questions but Dhyanam is not there in Maha Ganapati Prana P=\r\nratisthapana, so I could not check from the video whether it is to be loudl=\r\ny said, or just to meditate with it for a little while.\n\n2) I understand th=\r\nat when you&#39;re declaring the Rshi, you are indicating middle of the head. W=\r\nhen chhandah, lips. When Devata, middle of the chest. And for the beejam an=\r\nd (later) kilakam it&#39;s the same place you indicated... but is it navel (nab=\r\nhi) you are indicating?\n\n3) While declaring the shaktih, are you indicating=\r\n spine-base (kundalini)?\n\nI am quite sure I perhaps will not be having anym=\r\nore questions about Prana Pratisthapana :-)\n\nBy the way, please don&#39;t addre=\r\nss me &#39;Ji&#39;. Kindly call me by my name. I am much junior to you.\n\nRegards\nTa=\r\nnvir\n\n\n"}}
