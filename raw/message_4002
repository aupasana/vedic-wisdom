Some of my family me=\r\nmbers (gurujans) absolutely dedicated to sadhana, and hear some stories fro=\r\nm them, but I don&#39;t have any personal experience...\n\nThose Gurujis, who hav=\r\ne some experience atleast, please guide for something spiritual experience,=\r\n I know having this experience is not the goal, but somethimes mind seeks a=\r\ntleast one...\n\nI can remember two experience of mine, but not entirely sure=\r\n about that...\n\n1. there is a dream like vision during meditation when perf=\r\norming daily-ganapati-homam, but it could be the secration of &quot;Dimethyltryp=\r\ntamine&quot; too...\n\n2. normally I give money frequently to street beggars, but =\r\none day when I was busy at drinking from a street side food stall, a young(=\r\n30 around! but i am not sure, its hard to guess) woman ask for something to=\r\n give, but just look and find she is young enough to earn, so I refused to =\r\ngive. After that I suddenly remember the stories of Rajarshi, P.V.R Ji duri=\r\nng their tours with Manish, and then try to find her again, but she just va=\r\nnished within merely 30 seconds...I haven&#39;t see her before or after that in=\r\ncident...but I am sure too with this incident...\n\nGurujis, please guide, he=\r\nlp.\n\nPranam again,\nBiswajit\n\n\n"}}
