Shakti is =\r\nthe sum total of all the beings with various agendas engaging in various ka=\r\nrmas and experiencing various karmaphalas. Purusha is the witness of it all=\r\n.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Though each karma should give karmaphala that is commensurate =\r\nwith it, that requires an *agent* to deliver the karmaphala, i.e. another b=\r\neing. So this requires a complicated balancing act on part of Cosmic Cumula=\r\ntive Kinetic Consciousness (i.e. Shakti). There are very complicated rules =\r\nthat decide the *sequencing* of karmaphalas and picking of agents for their=\r\n delivery.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; At any time, some karmas from one&#39;s past are place=\r\nd in a &quot;must experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool, some karmas in a &quot;pr=\r\neferably experience karmaphala in this life&quot; pool and the rest in the third=\r\n pool which may not be experienced anytime soon. The way karmas are assigne=\r\nd and ordered in these pools is based on the balancing of karma/karmaphala =\r\nsequencing of all beings.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The assignment and ordering of these p=\r\nools will constantly undergo churn as one engages in various new actions an=\r\nd adds them to the pools. Also, as new people enter one&#39;s life, possibiliti=\r\nes in terms of karmaphala delivery agents and sequencing may change and hen=\r\nce the pools may be re-arranged.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; As on=\r\ne engages in remedial measures such as prayers, fasting, donations etc, one=\r\n may transform one&#39;s nature, change one&#39;s vulnerabilities or re-arrange one=\r\n&#39;s dynamics with other beings (including planets, deities etc, who are the =\r\nsubtle agents of delivery of karmaphala, who operate through other people w=\r\nho act as physical agents of delivery!). The karma pools may be re-arranged=\r\n as a result. Some undesirable karmas may be downgraded to a lower pool or =\r\npushed down in order within the same pool. Or, some desirable karmas may be=\r\n upgraded to a higher pool or pushed up in order within the same pool.\n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0When someone curses or blesses one, with sufficient mental force behi=\r\nnd it (this is the key), the same thing can happen. It is all about re-arra=\r\nnging karmas between the karmik pools. Every action by one, or even people =\r\naround one, has the potential to re-arrange one&#39;s karmik pools. A karma abo=\r\nut to give karmaphala may be postponed or a karma that was not to give karm=\r\naphala anytime soon may be advanced sooner.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; However, remember th=\r\nat the remedial measure has to be as intense as the karma that it is trying=\r\n to manipulate. You can move a small rock with small force, but you need a =\r\nlarge force to move a big rock or a hill.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; If there is no nega=\r\ntive karma in one&#39;s pool that can give a specific result, nobody can make o=\r\nne experience that result, no matter what ritual one does. However, even gr=\r\neat souls have a lot of negative karmas in their optional pool and even evi=\r\nl people have a lot of positive karmas in their optional pool, and hence po=\r\nwerful remedies, curses and blessings can often make some difference.\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; This point is well illustrated by the &quot;Guru Charitra&quot; story Digamber =\r\nji referred in his point (3).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If one t=\r\nhinks that one can escape the fruits of one&#39;s actions, one is mistakened. G=\r\nod is not like us human beings, who may show favoritism towards those who p=\r\nraise them or bribe them. The He-aspect of God is a witness to the play of =\r\nactions and fruits. The She-aspect of God is the power that impartially and=\r\n impassionately manages the fine balance and order within this play of acti=\r\nons and fruits. All beings are equal in Her eyes, from the lowest of evil p=\r\nersons to the noblest of saints. She administers just and balanced delivery=\r\n of fruits to actions using available agents.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; The karmas we comm=\r\nitted in the past are already in the pipeline and will give their results s=\r\nooner or later. The best we can do with them, with some effort, is to perha=\r\nps reorder them somewhat. The most important thing is to not add more serio=\r\nus bad karmas to the pipeline now. Simply put, selfish actions and actions =\r\nthat cause pain or harm to others are bad karmas and selfless actions and a=\r\nctions that cause pleasure or benefit to others are good karmas.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;=\r\n When it comes to manipulating the pre-existing pipeline of karmas awaiting=\r\n karmaphala, through conscious effort and current action, yes, it is possib=\r\nle and general guidelines are available in shastras, but we can&#39;t be certai=\r\nn about the specific impact of each action. One thing is for sure - remedia=\r\nl measure for overcoming a karma has to be commensurate with the karma itse=\r\nlf.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; You need only small force to push a cat out of your way, but=\r\n need a large force to push an elephant.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Nara=\r\nsimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt; F=\r\nrom: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, February 26, 2013 11:29 PM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom=\r\n] few questions\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;Dear=C2=A0Digamber,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;When =\r\na kingdom had no royal heirs, a special elephant was appointed by the court=\r\niers to randomly pick the next king. Thus, it was possible for a beggar to =\r\nsuddenly find himself the king. Whose karma is this?=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Vasis=\r\nhtha gives two answers: (1) This is the karma of the ministers, king, and a=\r\nll the citizens, and (2) This is the karma of the beggar turned king.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Everything is interrelated. The beggar&#39;s karma made him a king. The e=\r\nlephant&#39;s karma allowed him to be the one chosen to pick the king. The mini=\r\nster&#39;s karma allowed them to appoint the elephant to pick the king. And the=\r\n citizens&#39; karma allowed them to live in such a kingdom, and accept the res=\r\nult.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;The sanskrit word &quot;shaapa&quot; means a curse, or promise, or oa=\r\nth. Many of the curses that we see are for the benefit of mankind, and are =\r\nactually blessings. At the end of the day, some people with a certain amoun=\r\nt of purity of speech discharge their tapas shakti through speech.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;When it comes to people and their karmic pipeline, we usually make an as=\r\nsumption. We assume that there is a person, and separate from the person ar=\r\ne his many karmas. These karmas can &#39;come&#39; to the person from time to time.=\r\n We then want someone to come and remove all the &quot;bad&quot; karmas from our karm=\r\nic pipeline.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Vasishtha teaches us that a &#39;person&#39; and &#39;karma&#39; ar=\r\ne the same thing. You are your karmas. And you are nothing but your mind-im=\r\npressions ... your vaasanaas. In other words, your vaasanaas are your karma=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;If you can change your vaasanaas, you have changed your karma=\r\n. Or course, that is easier said than done.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Any moment when your=\r\n mind becomes quiet is a blessing. Any moment when your mind becomes agitat=\r\ned is a curse. As sadhakas, we run after quieting the mind !\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;sas=\r\nneham,\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0ajit\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;On Tue, Feb 26, 2013 at 8:08 A=\r\nM, &lt;dgporob@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Dear Narasimha Ji,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =\r\n=C2=A0 I was pondering over few things we routinely come across as a part o=\r\nf worship and how it manipulates karma pipe line,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;(1) When someone give=\r\ns a `curse&#39; or does a prayoga such as `maran&#39; or `uchhatan&#39; what happens to=\r\n a person who is at receiving end, does his bad karma comes forward or is i=\r\nt a new parabdha that is created. I vaguely remember Vimalananda mentioning=\r\n something about a Saint&#39;s curse in Aghora trilogy.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;(2) On similar note=\r\n, what happens when you get `blessings&#39; say from a saint or elders? We also=\r\n come across lot of tantric items like Rudraksha, Parad Shivalinga or say S=\r\nhwetarka Ganapati =E2=80&quot; what do this items really do if they work? Someth=\r\ning similar with wearing gemstones for planets =E2=80&quot; do they bring forwar=\r\nd good karmas or they create new ones?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;(3) I recollect an episode from =\r\nfamous &quot;Gurucharitra&quot; (well known in Maharashtra), wherein a just widowed l=\r\nady cried out to Shri Guru &quot;If we cannot change `parabdha, then, why do we =\r\nworship God at all&quot;. At that point Shri Guru rejuvenates her dead husband, =\r\nbut later tells his shisya, that he has only readjusted the karma from next=\r\n birth. [Please excuse me if this is not exact word to word, as I am trying=\r\n to recollect this episode from old memory].
