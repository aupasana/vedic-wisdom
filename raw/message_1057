Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; The mispronunciation of consonants with &quot;a&quot; occurring at the end of \nwor=\r\nds is \n&gt; so ingrained in your common sense that your understanding of \nDeva=\r\nnagari \n&gt; script itself is filled with mistakes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Look at the enclosed =\r\npicture (devanagari.jpg). It has six words - \nshava, \n&gt; vasha, shav, vash, =\r\nshiva and shiv. Each word is written in \nDevanagari script \n&gt; and then in E=\r\nnglish.\n&gt; \n&gt; Though the first word in that picture is &quot;shava&quot;, YOU will \npr=\r\nonounce it as \n&gt; &quot;shav&quot;. Please note that the second symbol in &quot;shava&quot; is i=\r\ndentical \nto the \n&gt; first symbol in &quot;vasha&quot;. However, YOU end up pronouncin=\r\ng that \nsymbol as &quot;v&quot; \n&gt; in the first word and as &quot;va&quot; in the second word. =\r\nYou pronounce the \nsame \n&gt; symbol as &quot;va&quot; in some cases and as &quot;v&quot; in some =\r\ncases. But please \nnote that \n&gt; Sanskrit is not like English and each symbo=\r\nl has a unique \npronunciation. If \n&gt; you pronounce correctly, that symbol i=\r\ns pronounced identically \n(as &quot;va&quot;) in \n&gt; both words. If you really want it=\r\n to be &quot;v&quot; (without a), it should \nbe \n&gt; written differently (as at the end=\r\n of 3rd and 6th words in the \npicture).\n&gt; \n&gt; Please go through the six exam=\r\nples carefully to know how to write \nthings in \n&gt; Devanagari correctly.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Bottomline: Things like &quot;Raam&quot; or &quot;Shiv Uvaach&quot; are wrong and mean \nnothi=\r\nng \n&gt; in Sanskrit. The Arabic influence on some modern Indian languages \n(e=\r\n.g. \n&gt; Hindi) that use the same script as Sanskrit corrupted people &#39;s \n&gt; p=\r\nronunciation of Sanskrit. What are pronounced by people as &quot;Raam&quot; \nand &quot;Shi=\r\nv \n&gt; Uvaach&quot; should actually be &quot;Raama&quot; and &quot;Shiva Uvaacha&quot;.

So you m=\r\nay do either.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; However, some combinations tried by others successf=\r\nully in the \npast\n&gt; &gt; are better and faster.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Regarding the specif=\r\nic mantra below: The words &quot;raam&quot; and &quot;jay&quot;\n&gt; &gt; (or &quot;jai&quot;) have no meaning =\r\nin Sanskrit. They should be &quot;raama&quot;\n&gt; &gt; and &quot;jaya&quot; respectively. Arabic has=\r\n words mostly ending in \nconsonants\n&gt; &gt; (i.e. no vowel &quot;a&quot; at the end of th=\r\ne word). That Arabic influence\n&gt; &gt; made Indians change Sanskrit words to re=\r\nmove &quot;a&quot; at the end of\n&gt; &gt; words. &quot;Jaya Raama&quot; becomes &quot;Jay Raam&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; If you want your mantra to be meaningful in Sanskrit, please\n&gt; &gt; restore =\r\n&quot;a&quot; at the end of words. The correct version of the mantra\n&gt; &gt; is &quot;Sree Raa=\r\nma Jaya Raama Jaya Jaya Raama&quot;. You can add &quot;Om&quot; at \nthe\n&gt; &gt; beginning.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; On our India trip in the summer of 200=\r\n8, I and my guru went to \nmany\n&gt; &gt; temples. There was one remote temple in =\r\nBriahdDwaraka that had a \nnice\n&gt; &gt; level of spiritual vibrations. It is a t=\r\nemple of Hanuman and\n&gt; &gt; Makaradhwaja (Hanuman&#39;s son) together. Apparently =\r\nsome yogi did\n&gt; &gt; intense sadhana there for a few decades in the past (with=\r\n the \nmantra\n&gt; &gt; you mentioned). The mantra above is written all over the w=\r\nalls of \nthe\n&gt; &gt; temple.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Though that yogi is not there now, the v=\r\nibrations created by his\n&gt; &gt; sadhana are still there. We were quite impress=\r\ned when we spent \nsome\n&gt; &gt; time there. You have to take a boat to go from D=\r\nwaarakaa to\n&gt; &gt; BrihadDwaarakaa and then go inside the village (a few km fr=\r\nom the\n&gt; &gt; main Krishna temple at BrihadDwaarakaa). It is a very small temp=\r\nle\n&gt; &gt; without any crowd, but has stronger spiritual energy than many \nfamo=\r\nus\n&gt; &gt; temples. If any of you go to Dwaraka or Gujarat in general, I\n&gt; &gt; re=\r\ncommend visiting that temple and spending a couple of hours \nthere.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; The mantra you gave reminded me of that temple.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -------------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------\n-\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n/homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tar=\r\npana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Fre=\r\ne Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyoti=\r\nsh software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Ce=\r\nntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n- \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   ----- Original M=\r\nessage ----- \n&gt; &gt;&gt;   From: Jyotisa Shisya\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, January 27, 2009 7:48 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Subject: Re: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] Kuja (Mars) homam manual available \nnow\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   |om|=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Dear Fellow travellers, namaste\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   All this talk abou=\r\nt Mangal reminds me about one question I&#39;ve \nhad\n&gt; &gt; for quite sometime. So=\r\nmetime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to\n&gt; &gt; any Hanuman temple and get=\r\n a mantra for lifting up the Mangal in \nmy\n&gt; &gt; natal chart which suffers fr=\r\nom rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and \nneecha\n&gt; &gt; in navamsa). When I visited th=\r\ne Hanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha\n&gt; &gt; Perumal temple, Thirumazhisai near C=\r\nhennai and asked the priest \nabout\n&gt; &gt; a mantra, he advised me to chant the=\r\n mantra inscribed on the \nwalls of\n&gt; &gt; the temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya ja=\r\nya ram| which comes out to be \na 7\n&gt; &gt; word, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy fro=\r\nm the 7th house to the 10th \nhouse\n&gt; &gt; with the mantra devata sitting in la=\r\ngna as per mantra shastra\n&gt; &gt; teachings. I&#39;ve been doing this every evening=\r\n since.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Later I came to know this is the Rama taraka mantr=\r\na. My \nquestion\n&gt; &gt; is how does this mantra help to counter the rajabhanga =\r\nof Mangal?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Secondly what is the correct form of the Rama t=\r\naraka mantra? \nIs it\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   |om sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| -=\r\n 8 words, 11 aksharas\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   or\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   |om sri rama jay=\r\na rama jaya jaya rama|? - 8 words, 14 aksharas\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Some say it=\r\n should be 13 aksharas....\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Sorry for astrological content =\r\nin this mail.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   best regards\n&gt; &gt;&gt;   Hari\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
