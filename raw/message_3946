Spirituaity is atleast not a narrow cult.\n=C2=A0\nActually t=\r\nhe spirtual people whose name comes up most often=C2=A0in this forum are Ra=\r\nmarkishna, Vivekananda, Ramana Maharishi. Anyway, it is good to study many =\r\nbooks but it is not bad to mention one or two saints whom you think have in=\r\nfluenced you most. Let us not get into traps of &quot;political correctness&quot;, ab=\r\nout how many times whose name has to be mentioned etc etc. Let everyone be =\r\nfinally free to mention or refer to anyone that attracts him or her.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nThe incident you mentioned about Lahiri Mahasaya happened between Lahiri M=\r\nahasaya and Sri Trilanga Swami. Trilanga Swami saw Lahiri Mahasaya near a m=\r\narket=C2=A0and bowed to him and said that this man (Lahiri Mahasaya) has at=\r\ntained a state living as a householder=C2=A0for which=C2=A0he (Trilanga Swa=\r\nmi) had to give up even the last cloth on his body.\n=C2=A0\nI urge all the r=\r\neaders of this group to read more books from different sects, different sai=\r\nnts and try to get appropriate influence.

Spirtuality is about tolera=\r\nnce and remaining neutral in different situations.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nI had the =\r\ngood fortune of reading most of Sri Lahiri Mahasay&#39;s diaries, some books of=\r\n Paramhamsa Yogananda,=C2=A0books of Sri=C2=A0Ramakrishna, Sri=C2=A0Ramana =\r\nMaharishi, parts of Sufi poetry, quite a bit of the actual=C2=A0Koran incld=\r\nuing al-Hadiths,=C2=A0some writings of Shankaracharya,=C2=A0Sri Aurobindo, =\r\nArthur Avalon, and some excellent collection of spiritual books in Bengali =\r\nabout Tantra. But nothing changed me more than the books of Vimalananda. Th=\r\nat is not to say that other books are not good, but for me, personally,=C2=\r\n=A0Vimalanada is the cr=C3=A8me de la cr=C3=A8me of sadhana. I have not com=\r\ne across any other book which answer so many practical queries regarding di=\r\nfferent kinds of sadhana in the simplest of words than Vimalanada&#39;s books. =\r\nAgain, everyone to his her liking.

I compliment him for aski=\r\nng it and having the courage to ask it.\n\nLord Shiva in Guru Gita tells to D=\r\nevi Parvati --- &quot;There is no mukti without bukti&quot;.\n\nAny good saint I have h=\r\nad a chance to read or listen or speak to,\nnever says that &quot;Do Sadhana with=\r\n spiritual expectations only&quot; In general I mean any type of Sadhana, Japam,=\r\n Homam, Karma Yoga, Seva, Charitable donation, bhajan,satsang and many othe=\r\nr types.\n\nThey always try to increase further the Shraddaha of a sadhak in =\r\nthings that captivates a Sadhaka&#39;s mind due to his or her state of sanskars=\r\n.\n\nThey always try to help the Sadhak walk on the path that leads towards s=\r\npirituality. They always wish well for their disciples and have good amount=\r\n of patience.\n\nMany Sadgurus take care of their disciples for many life tim=\r\nes, helping and guiding in each life time.\n\nThey always preach many things =\r\nand show value for different types of sadhanas depending on their state, ti=\r\nme, and type of disciple.\n\nFor householders always there are challanges and=\r\n one should request God to look into it and give guidance and help, whether=\r\n it is food, house, marriage, car, or any material issue. There is nothing =\r\nwrong in doing this, even if sadhana done for materialistic benefits.\n\nToda=\r\ny even those who have renounced householder life have to pray god to fulfil=\r\nl some of their material needs.\n\nWe live in very difficult and challanging =\r\ntimes and it appears it is going to become more challenging.\n\nSome material=\r\n gain can at times make a person better or more balanced or be more prepare=\r\nd to do sadhana for spiritual benefits. \n\nEven during an eclipse many peopl=\r\ne do mantras etc to solve problems or improve material conditions, there is=\r\n nothing wrong about it. I have read messages in the past on this group sug=\r\ngesting natives not to do it or it is wrong. These type of messages are not=\r\n correct, it only confuses people. Time during the eclipse is very good for=\r\n getting results for any sadhana done during that time. it is equally good =\r\nfor material or spiritual type.\n\nEveryone has right to have a opinion and s=\r\nhare their views but one needs to also understand the influence aspect of t=\r\nhose views.\n\nEvery Shotra or prayer or even Geeta or Ramayan, there are rid=\r\ners at the end for results like becoming wealthy, overcoming challenges, en=\r\nemies etc.\nIf it were inappropriate the Seers from the past would not write=\r\n it.\nAre they wrong in writing that?\n\nThey write it to motivate people to r=\r\nead them as one reads more times there is a possibility that may lead to ch=\r\nange in the person&#39;s attitude.\n\nMoving to original set of questions,\n\nEvery=\r\n one is born with accumulated sanskars out of which as a native interacts w=\r\nith the world some of these accumulated or sanchit sanskars take the form o=\r\nf prarabdh sanskara, these type of sanskars give pleasure, pain and challan=\r\nges to the native. Sanchit Sanskars are like seeds and Prarabdh sanskars ar=\r\ne like a tree that bears fruit.\n\nAll human beings are also born with anothe=\r\nr quality and that is known as will power. They say will power can change d=\r\nestiny ...\n\nWhen one does sadhana like say Homaam or Japam. Many things hap=\r\npen\nat many levels, at times there is improvement in materialistic situatio=\r\nn, problems get solved or if the problems remain that state of sadhaka beco=\r\nmes such that he or she pays less attention to the problem or attaches less=\r\n importance to the problem. God or Guru or Shakti shows the sadhaka a path =\r\nto move forward. Sadhana does increase will power and makes one more tolera=\r\nnt and \nSadhana also help in eliminating the sanchit sanskars, in fact one =\r\nSaint use to say, do your sadhana and your sanchit sanskars will get crushe=\r\nd such that they can never germinate or fruitify into prarabdh sanskars.\n\nS=\r\no yes doing sadhana can help one overcome many things at different levels a=\r\nnd help one move in the right direction. At times one moves faster or very =\r\nslowly. The important thing is moving and if one falls down, than one shoul=\r\nd immediately get up.\n\nThere are many ways to improve and move faster towar=\r\nds spirtuality,\nVimalanda is not just one saint, there are many who have re=\r\nached similar or higher or lower realizations adopting different methods an=\r\nd have written very good books too. Sprituality is much bigger, deeper and =\r\nbroader than what Vimalanada has described in his books.\n\nI find it little =\r\ncultish to just refer him all the time in the group. Spirituaity is atleast=\r\n not a narrow cult.\n\nPlease note that I have nothing against Him, I respect=\r\n him as I respect other saints from the bottom of my heart. I did spent mon=\r\ney to get his books and plan to read in near future.\n\nI urge all the reader=\r\ns of this group to read more books from different sects, different saints a=\r\nnd try to get appropriate influence. Get broader and deeper views as that h=\r\nelps forming a good base for spirituality. Spirtuality is about tolerance a=\r\nnd remaining neutral in different situations.\n\nThe Nath Sampradaya, Shiviat=\r\nes from Kashmir, the lineage of Ramananda,\nDatta Sampradaya, the sufis, eve=\r\nn some christain saints (The book of Mirdad) and many more sects some of th=\r\ne Lhamas of Buddhism had very deeper realizations and experiance. There are=\r\n many sects in south india too, kerala, tamil nadu, andhra pradhesh, mahara=\r\nstra,rajastha n, gujarat and other states, all of them had great saints.\n\nG=\r\nenerally these saints never bothered to write or explain or were not able t=\r\no explain. But some did write and a lot of good work is out there to explor=\r\ne along with doing sadhana.\n\nWe live in times where there is very little gu=\r\nidance available on the path of spirituality. So in these times we have to =\r\nmake up with reading good books written by saints of yestaryers and surrend=\r\ner more to god.\n\nThere is scarcity of Sadgurus and good Sadhaks, we have ma=\r\nny entry level and confused situation :-) ....\n\nIf you look at sikhism, the=\r\n last sadguru dev from their sect made the book &quot;granth saheb&quot; as the guru =\r\ninstead of making anyone else take his seat.\n\nWhen Lahiri Mahashaya met a f=\r\namoius saint of kashi, he got lot of respect from him. Some of the famous s=\r\naint&#39;s disciple were upset,\nat that the saint reminds them that to reach hi=\r\ns own spiritual state he took 400 or so years but Lahiri Mahashaya did it i=\r\nn one birth.\nHis name slips my tongue, he was big and very strong lived in =\r\nwater many hours at a time, his name starts with tri. They say that one is =\r\nnot able to stare at the eyes of the statue of the saint at his samadhi man=\r\ndir.\n\nOne must always try to broaden ones perspective, all of us have a lon=\r\ng long way to go, even if some may feel that oh I only have some more thing=\r\ns left so I may be done in some years, even that is an interesting situatio=\r\nn as there is always a chance of falling down.\n\nEven for Saint Bharathari o=\r\nne of the nav naths, he was so elevated but he also had some sanskars that =\r\nforced him to take birth and enjoy first and than suffer due to pingala. He=\r\n was already realized before his birth as the rajah.\n\nI did not intend to o=\r\nffend anyone or thier veiws, If I inadvertantly did it I appologize in adva=\r\nnce, Narashima has written very well many times and of late has written som=\r\ne good stuff.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com,=\r\n &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Raju,\n&gt; \n&gt; It seems hon=\r\nest outburst.

That is not to say that other books are n=\r\not good, but for me, personally,&nbsp;Vimalanada is the cr=C3=A8me de la cr=\r\n=C3=A8me of sadhana. I have not come across any other book which answer so =\r\nmany practical queries regarding different kinds of sadhana in the simplest=\r\n of words than Vimalanada&#39;s books. Again, everyone to his her liking. Obvio=\r\nusly, there can be no compulsion in these matters ever.

I compl=\r\niment him for asking it and having the courage to ask it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lord Shiva=\r\n in Guru Gita tells to Devi Parvati --- &quot;There is no mukti without bukti&quot;.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Any good saint I have had a chance to read or listen or speak to,&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;never says that &quot;Do Sadhana with spiritual expectations only&quot; In general I=\r\n mean any type of Sadhana, Japam, Homam, Karma Yoga, Seva, Charitable donat=\r\nion, bhajan,satsang and many other types.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They always try to increas=\r\ne further the Shraddaha of a sadhak in things that captivates a Sadhaka&#39;s m=\r\nind due to his or her state of sanskars.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They always try to help the=\r\n Sadhak walk on the path that leads towards spirituality. They always wish =\r\nwell for their disciples and have good amount of patience.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Many Sadg=\r\nurus take care of their disciples for many life times, helping and guiding =\r\nin each life time.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;They always preach\n many things and show value fo=\r\nr different types of sadhanas depending on their state, time, and type of d=\r\nisciple.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;For householders always there are challanges and one should=\r\n request God to look into it and give guidance and help, whether it is food=\r\n, house, marriage, car, or any material issue. There is nothing wrong in do=\r\ning this, even if sadhana done for materialistic benefits.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Today eve=\r\nn those who have renounced householder life have to pray god to fulfill som=\r\ne of their material needs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;We live in very difficult and challanging=\r\n times and it appears it is going to become more challenging.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some m=\r\naterial gain can at times make a person better or more balanced or be more =\r\nprepared to do sadhana for spiritual benefits. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even during an eclip=\r\nse many people do mantras etc to solve problems or improve material conditi=\r\nons, there is nothing wrong about it. I have read messages in the past on t=\r\nhis group suggesting natives not to do\n it or it is wrong. These type of me=\r\nssages are not correct, it only confuses people. Time during the eclipse is=\r\n very good for getting results for any sadhana done during that time. it is=\r\n equally good for material or spiritual type.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Everyone has right to =\r\nhave a opinion and share their views but one needs to also understand the i=\r\nnfluence aspect of those views.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Every Shotra or prayer or even Geeta=\r\n or Ramayan, there are riders at the end for results like becoming wealthy,=\r\n overcoming challenges, enemies etc.&lt;BR&gt;If it were inappropriate the Seers =\r\nfrom the past would not write it.&lt;BR&gt;Are they wrong in writing that?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;They write it to motivate people to read them as one reads more times ther=\r\ne is a possibility that may lead to change in the person&#39;s attitude.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Moving to original set of questions,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Every one is born with accumul=\r\nated sanskars out of which as a native interacts with the world some of the=\r\nse accumulated or sanchit\n sanskars take the form of prarabdh sanskara, the=\r\nse type of sanskars give pleasure, pain and challanges to the native. Sanch=\r\nit Sanskars are like seeds and Prarabdh sanskars are like a tree that bears=\r\n fruit.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;All human beings are also born with another quality and that=\r\n is known as will power. They say will power can change destiny ...&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nWhen one does sadhana like say Homaam or Japam. Many things happen&lt;BR&gt;at ma=\r\nny levels, at times there is improvement in materialistic situation, proble=\r\nms get solved or if the problems remain that state of sadhaka becomes such =\r\nthat he or she pays less attention to the problem or attaches less importan=\r\nce to the problem. God or Guru or Shakti shows the sadhaka a path to move f=\r\norward. Sadhana does increase will power and makes one more tolerant and &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Sadhana also help in eliminating the sanchit sanskars, in fact one Saint =\r\nuse to say, do your sadhana and your sanchit sanskars will get crushed such=\r\n that they can\n never germinate or fruitify into prarabdh sanskars.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nSo yes doing sadhana can help one overcome many things at different levels =\r\nand help one move in the right direction. At times one moves faster or very=\r\n slowly. The important thing is moving and if one falls down, than one shou=\r\nld immediately get up.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are many ways to improve and move faste=\r\nr towards spirtuality,&lt;BR&gt;Vimalanda is not just one saint, there are many w=\r\nho have reached similar or higher or lower realizations adopting different =\r\nmethods and have written very good books too. Sprituality is much bigger, d=\r\neeper and broader than what Vimalanada has described in his books.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I=\r\n find it little cultish to just refer him all the time in the group. Spirit=\r\nuaity is atleast not a narrow cult.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please note that I have nothing =\r\nagainst Him, I respect him as I respect other saints from the bottom of my =\r\nheart. I did spent money to get his books and plan to read in near future.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I\n urge all the readers of this group to read more books from differ=\r\nent sects, different saints and try to get appropriate influence. Get broad=\r\ner and deeper views as that helps forming a good base for spirituality. Spi=\r\nrtuality is about tolerance and remaining neutral in different situations.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The Nath Sampradaya, Shiviates from Kashmir, the lineage of Ramanand=\r\na,&lt;BR&gt;Datta Sampradaya, the sufis, even some christain saints (The book of =\r\nMirdad) and many more sects some of the Lhamas of Buddhism had very deeper =\r\nrealizations and experiance. There are many sects in south india too, keral=\r\na, tamil nadu, andhra pradhesh, maharastra,rajastha n, gujarat and other st=\r\nates, all of them had great saints.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Generally these saints never bot=\r\nhered to write or explain or were not able to explain. But some did write a=\r\nnd a lot of good work is out there to explore along with doing sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;We live in times where there is very little guidance available on the\n =\r\npath of spirituality. So in these times we have to make up with reading goo=\r\nd books written by saints of yestaryers and surrender more to god.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;T=\r\nhere is scarcity of Sadgurus and good Sadhaks, we have many entry level and=\r\n confused situation :-) ....&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If you look at sikhism, the last sadgur=\r\nu dev from their sect made the book &quot;granth saheb&quot; as the guru instead of m=\r\naking anyone else take his seat.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Lahiri Mahashaya met a famoius=\r\n saint of kashi, he got lot of respect from him. Some of the famous saint&#39;s=\r\n disciple were upset,&lt;BR&gt;at that the saint reminds them that to reach his o=\r\nwn spiritual state he took 400 or so years but Lahiri Mahashaya did it in o=\r\nne birth.&lt;BR&gt;His name slips my tongue, he was big and very strong lived in =\r\nwater many hours at a time, his name starts with tri. They say that one is =\r\nnot able to stare at the eyes of the statue of the saint at his samadhi man=\r\ndir.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One must always try to broaden ones perspective, all of\n us hav=\r\ne a long long way to go, even if some may feel that oh I only have some mor=\r\ne things left so I may be done in some years, even that is an interesting s=\r\nituation as there is always a chance of falling down.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Even for Saint=\r\n Bharathari one of the nav naths, he was so elevated but he also had some s=\r\nanskars that forced him to take birth and enjoy first and than suffer due t=\r\no pingala. He was already realized before his birth as the rajah.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I =\r\ndid not intend to offend anyone or thier veiws, If I inadvertantly did it I=\r\n appologize in advance, Narashima has written very well many times and of l=\r\nate has written some good stuff.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best Regards&lt;BR&gt;Mitesh &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- =\r\nIn &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.mc955.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%4=\r\n0yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wi=\r\nsdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; =\r\n&lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Raju,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; It seems honest outburst.

Finally, one may be pu=\r\nshed to an extreme.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; However, god is kind (even a=\r\nn ugra devata). God never pushes one to the breaking limit. God may push on=\r\ne short of the breaking limit. The breaking limit may change and then god m=\r\nay push further.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To use the analogy from the oth=\r\ner mail of today, god the teacher does not test the 5th grade student with =\r\n6th grade questions. Of course, a\n 5th grade student passing from 5th grade=\r\n to the 6th grade will now be tested with 6th grade questions.
