One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)\n=\r\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2 =C2 =C2 s=\r\nhri\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talki=\r\nng\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; about\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was=\r\n a weekly\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; gathering at\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was s=\r\ninging devotional songs created\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; by\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; him and was weeping wh=\r\nile singing. He was reading Ramkrishna\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 yo=\r\nungsters were attending this weekly\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; meeting\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday e=\r\nvening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then.

I shall have to go now=E2?=9D. -\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; -\n =\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him.\n  &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be a plane\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncrash\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened.

I prayed\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; him\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deeply=\r\n from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; grace.\n =\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning=\r\n\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was\n  =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; waking\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning=\r\n that I have\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife w=\r\nas annoyed and\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; she\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; argued with me a lot. =E2?&quot;=E2?oWhy sh=\r\nould you take such a hasty\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; decision?\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramkrishna Paramhams=\r\na was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta.

I thought-- yes I have ta=\r\nken\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n  &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling\n  =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples to test him before accepting him. I also decided to=\r\n\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =E2?&quot;=E2?oSee, Mr. =\r\nPatel\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; has\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. You have also not seen =\r\nhim. He has never\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; asked\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; me where I am living. Suppose Mr.=\r\n Patel is coming to our house\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; within\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, wo=\r\nuld you believe that my selection for Thakur is\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; perfect?=E2?=9D--=\r\n\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=E2?&quot;=E2?oHow it is possible? I don=E2?Tt bel=\r\nieve.=E2?=9D-\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; -\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel =\r\nimmediately to justify my\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decision and convince my wife. =E2?~I w=\r\nant to test your existence\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; even\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; today.=E2?T\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\no our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mo=\r\nrning with angry mood. What he told?\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =E2?~ How dare you test Th=\r\nakur this way? Do you know what happened?\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yesterday was my night =\r\nduty and I had just come to my home at 05.30\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mornings today and t=\r\nried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; pulled my blanket=\r\n and told me that-=E2?o Go to your friend=E2?Ts\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; house. He\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; house=\r\n=E2?=9D\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding m=\r\ne the way\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; to\n  &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your house and pushing me too. What you want=\r\n?

I am going back to the period \n  of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; 19=\r\n73/74.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Kindly read this only \n  when you are in reli=\r\ngious mood.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C2&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nI was working as telegraphist at Okha Port Post office \n  near&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Dwarka.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My duty was from 7 am to \n  7 pm and I=\r\n was getting late fee allowance&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; for&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt; =\r\n&gt; extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opposite to \n  Post&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; office and due to same Dep=E2?Tt; I had friendship \n  =\r\nwith some&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Telephone&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; operators. One=\r\n \n  Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n  was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2 =C2 =C2 shr=\r\ni&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he wa=\r\ns always \n  talking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; shri Tha=\r\nkur. We came \n  close day by day. There was a weekly&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; gath=\r\nering at&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; his home called SATSANGA. He was singing=\r\n devotional songs \n  created&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; by&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hi=\r\nm and was weeping while \n  singing. He was reading Ramkrishna&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Kathamrita. We 10 to \n  12 youngsters were attending this weekly&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; meeting&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; on Saturday evening. I =\r\nwas then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of \n  30&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; then. =\r\nWe were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm \n  after duty hours&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; and were talking only about \n  Thakur.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; One day when we were at sea shore he \n  suddenly told me--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; =E2?oRawalbhai,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; some \n  guest have come to my=\r\n home and my wife is remembering me. My&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  son&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; will come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have \n  to go n=\r\now=E2?=9D. -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; And with my \n  surp=\r\nrise his 8 years old son came to call him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At \n=\r\n  one another incident he told me that there will be a plane&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; \n  crash&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tomorrow and that also happened. I was =\r\nvery much \n  impressed about&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nHe could foresee \n  the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus,&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; told me not to go through bus, as=\r\n bus tire will be punctured. \n  Yet I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; went to Bus st=\r\nation but bus did not come from \n  Dwarka as was&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; puncture=\r\nd&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on the way. \n  This was surprising.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; This all incidents made me to \n  believe that he had some sup=\r\ner&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; power&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n  and this was due to Ra=\r\nmkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; shri=\r\n Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of \n  shri&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm \n  I surrend=\r\nered&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; myself&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to Thakur at Mr. \n  Pa=\r\ntel=E2?Ts house before Thakur picture. I prayed&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; him&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; \n  &gt; &gt; &gt; deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower and =\r\nbestow \n  his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; grace.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Next day=\r\n morning I \n  had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; while \n  taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  waking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up at 5.45 morning. I told=\r\n to my wife in the \n  morning that I have&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accepted S=\r\nhri Ramkrishnadev as my \n  Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; she&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n  argued with me a lot. =E2?&quot;=E2?oWhy should=\r\n you take such a hasty&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  decision?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa \n  Kali at Calcutta. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; was a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; great \n  Saint but our Guru should=\r\n be living one, who can guide us,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  give&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri \n  Ram Sharma&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Acharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; since you are \n  doing Gayat=\r\nri Mantra=E2?=9D--.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Her arguments were \n  right=\r\n at her place as people in general not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; know&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n  &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have \n=\r\n  taken&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr=\r\n. \n  Patel. --&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel ha=\r\nd told \n  me that Thakur was telling&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; their disciples=\r\n to test him \n  before accepting him. I also decided to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; test Thakur. I \n  immediately told my wife that =E2?&quot;=E2?oSee, Mr. Pate=\r\nl&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  has&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; never come to our home. Y=\r\nou have also not seen him. \n  He has never&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; asked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; me where I am \n  living. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our =\r\nhouse&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  within&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 10 to 15 minutes, =\r\nwould you believe that my \n  selection for Thakur is&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n perfect?=E2?=9D--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; &gt; She laughed at me=E2?&quot;=E2=\r\n?oHow it is possible? I don=E2?Tt \n  believe.=E2?=9D-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; -&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I prayed Shri \n  Thakur to send Mr. Patel immedi=\r\nately to justify my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n  decision and convince my wife=\r\n. =E2?~I want to test your existence&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; \n  &gt; even&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; today.=E2?T&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To our \n  great surprise=\r\n, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; \n  &gt; mornin=\r\ng with angry mood. What he told?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =E2?~ \n  How d=\r\nare you test Thakur this way?
