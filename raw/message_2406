I alw=\r\nays wanted to perform this homam on my own and after seeing your video and =\r\nthe Laghu padhati document I am sure I can do it myself. I have couple of r=\r\nequests from my side: \n\n1) Is it possible to create a document for the full=\r\n fledged Ganapathi homam ? This will be immensely helpful for people who ha=\r\nve the time and intrest to perform such a homam. \n\n2) There are some other =\r\nimportant homams particularly the following in which I am deeply intrested =\r\n: \na) Sudarshana Homam \nb) Navagraha Homam \nc) Purusha Suktha Homam \n\nI wou=\r\nld request you to kindly create documents similar to the Maha Ganapathi Hom=\r\nam PDF so that the larger population is benefited. \n\nSwami Sharanam. \nThank=\r\ns and Regards, \nGirish Sundaram\n\n\n\n"}}
