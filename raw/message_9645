I wa=\r\nnted to share a suggestion that works along with any of these.\n\nIn all vaid=\r\nika karmas, there is a procedure called &quot;pratisara-bandha&quot;. This is a raksh=\r\na bandhana where a cotton thread (optimally made of 9 strands) is energized=\r\n with mantras and then worn around the wrist so that a little of the mantra=\r\n shakti stays with you. A kalasha is established, with some vibhuti and a c=\r\notton thread placed to it&#39;s north. Then, Varuna is invoked in the kalasha, =\r\nand then a number of vedic mantras are recited. At the end, we pray to Varu=\r\nna once again, and then sprinkle the water from the kalasha on the yajamana=\r\n and the cotton thread. The cotton thread is then worn on the wrist (right =\r\nhand for men, left hand for women) as an amulet, and the vibhuti is worn on=\r\n the forehead. \n\nThe vaidika procedure specifies particular sets of mantras=\r\n. In the bodhayana tradition, this starts with the rAkshoghnam (something t=\r\no destroy rAkshasas). However, you may use some other mantra in it&#39;s place.=\r\n If you are using the hanuman chalisa, as Narasimha suggested, you can chan=\r\nt that mantra a number of times, and then wear the thread and vibhuti. Or, =\r\nyou could follow the Satayanarayana puja manual with the cotton thread and =\r\nvibhuti near by, and then sprinkle the thread with water and then wear it a=\r\nnd the vibhuti. You could even put a pot of water, think of Varuna, then do=\r\n a bunch of bhajans, and then wear the thread and sprinkle the water on the=\r\n area where you will be sleeping. The principle is the same.=C2=A0 \n\nThe pr=\r\nocedure for &quot;pratisarabandha&quot; specifically mentions disturbed sleep as an a=\r\npplication.\n\nsasneham,\n\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 ajit\n\n\n\nOn Mon, Aug 5, 2013 at 8:20 A=\r\nM, ilya.suzdalnitski &lt;ilya.suzdalnitski@...&gt; wrote: \nHello everyone,\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;Recently I was staying at an old house in a village.
