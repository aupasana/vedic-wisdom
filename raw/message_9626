Lately, I k=\r\nept coming back to the site and decided to take it step by step to gain con=\r\nfidence, so I have started reading the text of Shri Maha Ganapathi homam ti=\r\nll the word flow is fluent. I&#39;m less intimidated by it now. I&#39;m also quite =\r\ngrateful to Shri Narasimhaji for making it available as I have been wanting=\r\n to do this for a long time. But am still not ready to start it. The reason=\r\n is that certain words are so long that, to maintain a flow, I need to spli=\r\nt the word into bits that will help maintain the flow but need to know wher=\r\ne to split in order that I don&#39;t change the meaning of it. I&#39;m following th=\r\ne Sanskrit version. I want to include the words (a long list) in the hope t=\r\nhat one of you members can help me split them up in the right way, but my c=\r\nomputer does not type the sanskrit words, nor am I able to copy and paste t=\r\nhe sanskrit word, it does not do allow it. How can I upload those words?\n\nT=\r\nhanks very much,\n\nAlamelu \n\n\n"}}
