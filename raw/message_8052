Arjuna was not a Jivan muktha or even vidEha muktha that life. One =\r\ntradition states that Arjuna re-incarnated as Kannappa (Bhakta Kannappa) wh=\r\no becomes a devotee of Shiva (remember that in Mahabharat itself the seed f=\r\nor this was sown in an episode that Arjuna and Shiva fight for a wild boar =\r\nthey hunted). It is in that Kannappa life that he attains to mukti at srI k=\r\nALahasti. In Kurukshetra war, Arjuna arrives at a certain state of uncondit=\r\nioned awareness or consciousness due to the dilemma and circumstances of th=\r\ne war and Krishna utilized that receptivity(arising out of utter helplessne=\r\nss and hence willingness to surrender) to give him glimpses of the Virat sw=\r\narupam. You can liken the viswaroopam event to Ramakrishna making Narendra =\r\nexperience divinity by placing his feet on the chest. \n\nI think Narasimha g=\r\nAru&#39;s second post on jIvan mukta was relatively straight and clear on the c=\r\noncept. The other points I&#39;ll add is that action done by tri-karanas do res=\r\nult in consequence(s) to the doer (as long as the action was done while doe=\r\nr holds conditioned identity). All this accumulates in the sanchita (wareho=\r\nuse) of the doer and a portion of it gets allotted as prarabdha for a given=\r\n life. This prarabdha one has to experience whether they are liberated or n=\r\not. Removal of conditioning does drop the entire Sanchita (breaks the threa=\r\nd that is holding the Sanchita to the being) but prarabdha itself holds as =\r\nthis was already allotted and in itself is the primary cause for the embodi=\r\ned life of that being. If you drop prarabdha you drop the body and hence li=\r\nfe too. Because that karmic structure is what glues the jIva and the sarIra=\r\n. A jIvan mukta had dropped all conditioning and hence his bondages to all =\r\nsanchita is gone. No new bondage is established for newer actions (agAmi) b=\r\necause the actions now are not conditioned by any kind of ignorance(mAya). =\r\nThese actions themselves can have consequences but they are not tied to him=\r\n and hence not attached/directed at him. They &#39;can&#39; even attack their prAra=\r\nbdha to alter it if neeeded, but as they had already become pure witnesses =\r\nthan agenda driven conditioned individuals, they generally don&#39;t get into t=\r\nhat and experience all of their prarabdha to let it burn naturally. They al=\r\nso have capabilities to create and accumulate &#39;conscious and measured quant=\r\nity and quality of sanchita&#39; to be available as prarabdha for a future life=\r\n, if they intend to re-incarnate. However, whether the &#39;veil of mAya&#39; was p=\r\nut consciously by oneself or was eternally present as we forgot that we put=\r\n it ourselves, as long as the veil is on us there will be an amount of cond=\r\nitioning and ignorance. The main difference is that just as a man who puts =\r\na veil on his face sees blurred but is fully aware that he can anytime lift=\r\n the veil at his own will to see through clearly, a re-incarnated avatAra a=\r\nlso knows that the veil of mAya was put on for a purpose and can be dropped=\r\n once the purpose is served. The case of rest of us is that of a man who pu=\r\nt the veil a long time ago but totally forgot about that i.e. a) that the v=\r\neil exists and is interfering with his vision and b) that the veil was put =\r\nby himself and it is within his own control to remove it. Hence we do all s=\r\nadhana to recognize that distinction between the veil and ourselves and thu=\r\ns drop the veil. \n\nRegards,\n-Prasad\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;=\r\nRama V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste - Well, I still don&#39;t get it. =\r\nSo Jeevanmukta is liberated from what ?

One&#39;s experiences and actions are due to \n&gt; &gt; the mo=\r\nmentum set in motion by previously present conditioning. One \n&gt; &gt; engages i=\r\nn them with no agendas, likes, dislikes, and attachments. Thus, \n&gt; &gt; a jeev=\r\nanmukta operates the previous identity till the momentum comes to \n&gt; &gt; a sc=\r\nreeching halt and then the body, senses, sensory mind, buddhi etc \n&gt; &gt; are =\r\nreturned to the original sources from which they were borrowed and \n&gt; &gt; mad=\r\ne sentient. But a jeevanmukta is free and unbound even while \n&gt; &gt; operating=\r\n with an identity, for binding comes from the conditioning and \n&gt; &gt; not fro=\r\nm identification or actions. When the identity dissolves, it is \n&gt; &gt; not an=\r\ny better or any extra freedom.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Most likely, a jeevanmukta ceases t=\r\no operate an identity after some \n&gt; &gt; time, that time depending on the stre=\r\nngth of prior momentum! It can be \n&gt; &gt; days or months or years or centuries=\r\n or millennia.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nature sets such powerful momentum in place for som=\r\ne beings (e.g. \n&gt; &gt; saptarshis, Vishnu, Shiva etc) that they may operate an=\r\n identity for a \n&gt; &gt; very long time after conditioning drops off completely=\r\n. It may even be \n&gt; &gt; for the entire duration of Creation. As a part of the=\r\n momentum set in \n&gt; &gt; motion previously, one may even direct a part of one&#39;=\r\ns ahamkara to \n&gt; &gt; identify with a newly created identity (e.g. a new incar=\r\nnation).

The problem is *conditioning* \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (li=\r\nkes, dislikes, wants, agendas etc) that drives the identification \n&gt; &gt; &gt; an=\r\nd use of what one&#39;s ahamkara identifies with. If ahamkara \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (identific=\r\nation) evaporates when chitta (conditioning) is cleaned up, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it is no=\r\nrmal mukti. If ahamkara (identification) remains while chitta \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (condi=\r\ntioning) is cleaned up, it is jeevanmukti. It is as simple as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If one engages in an action with zero condi=\r\ntioning, then there is no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; karma and there are no rinas created. Acti=\r\nons (physical or mental) by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; themselves do not bind one - it is the  =\r\n*conditioned* actions that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; bind one! It is the likes, dislikes, desi=\r\nres, agendas etc (i.e. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; conditioning in chitta) behind an action that=\r\n bind one!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If somebody who is not YET a jee=\r\nvanmukta (but close) identified with a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; body and engaged in an action=\r\n that IS driven by some conditioning, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; however subtle or pure or dhar=\r\nmik that conditioning may be (!), then \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that sets in motion the law o=\r\nf kaarmik action-reaction which will in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; due time give a particular r=\r\neaction to what one identified with when \n&gt; &gt; &gt; engaging in that action.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; By the time the reaction is experienced, all the conditioning may be \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; overcome and one may become jeevanmukta. Yet, the momentum set in \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; motion before one became jeevanmukta will continue to affect the body, \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; senses and sensory mind, i.e. whatever one&#39;s ahamkara is identifying =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with. But, because there is no conditioning and hence no agendas, no=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; desires, no likes and dislikes, one neither rejoices nor protests n=\r\nor \n&gt; &gt; &gt; tries to modify the happenings to what one is identifying with.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sensing that there is a pain requires no con=\r\nditioning. It is the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; function of manas, i.e. Chandra. Observing that=\r\n there is more pain in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the evening than morning (or when swallowing)=\r\n requires no \n&gt; &gt; &gt; conditioning. It is the function of buddhi, i.e. Budha.=\r\n But thinking \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of praying to god to reduce pain requires conditioning=\r\n in chitta \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (absent in a jeevanmukta!).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Though a jeevanmukta is=\r\n identifying with a body, one does not view it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; as something his own =\r\nand something that must be kept in a particular \n&gt; &gt; &gt; state. He identifies=\r\n with it, but has no agendas for it. All that \n&gt; &gt; &gt; comes from conditionin=\r\ng in chitta, which is absent now!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The unconditioned identifier (liber=\r\nated I-ness) views what one \n&gt; &gt; &gt; identifies with as an *amalgam* of porti=\r\nons borrowed from various \n&gt; &gt; &gt; deities (pancha mahabhootas, Moon, Mercury=\r\n, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Time \n&gt; &gt; &gt; etc) and hence as a manifestation of Li=\r\nght itself. One does not view \n&gt; &gt; &gt; it from the prism of &quot;this is me, I ne=\r\ned to use it to pursue X or Y \n&gt; &gt; &gt; agenda.&quot; One views it as &quot;this is me. =\r\nI am made of portions borrowed \n&gt; &gt; &gt; from various deities, i.e. various ma=\r\nnifestations of Light.

As mind identi=\r\nfies \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with a body, it projects its rinas on the body and makes the b=\r\nody \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;experience&quot; and &quot;do&quot; things, in accordance with those \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nrinas/conditioning. If the conditioning in chitta is completely wiped \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; out and ahamkara merges in Self, then it is mukti. But, if the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; c=\r\nonditioning in chitta is completely wiped out and yet ahamkara \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cont=\r\ninues to exist with no limiting notions (it is basically the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; condit=\r\nioning in chitta that is limiting), then one becomes \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta (l=\r\niberated while living). Unlike in the case of one who \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; leaves body a=\r\nnd gets mukti, a jeevanmukta continues to have an I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (but which=\r\n is not limited by any notions or conditioning). This \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; unconditioned=\r\n I-ness does project into a body. But it does not say &quot;I \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; am this bo=\r\ndy and hence this body should be kept healthy or strong&quot; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (THAT woul=\r\nd be conditioning in chitta, which is wiped out now!). On \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the other=\r\n hand, it does not either say &quot;this body should be ignored \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and dest=\r\nroyed&quot;. Though conditioning is absent now, body keeps \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; experiencing =\r\nand doing things based on the *momentum* set in motion \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; before one b=\r\necame jeevanmukta and engaged in conditioned experiences \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and action=\r\ns. This is like a fan turning for a while after the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; electricity has=\r\n been stopped. Manas, buddhi and indriyas keep working \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as they did =\r\nbefore. If one has throat cancer, indriyas may sense \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Manas (s=\r\nensory/motor mind) may process that input and register \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; pain. Buddhi=\r\n may analyze various observations and draw various \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conclusions (e.g=\r\n. &quot;when I gulp or try to swallow food, it hurts even \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; more&quot;, &quot;when I=\r\n take so and so herbal liquid, it feels better&quot; etc). A \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; normal pers=\r\non whose conditioned mind (chitta) says &quot;I should overcome \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and not =\r\nhave this pain&quot; may think of various things to do and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; struggle with=\r\n them. But an unconditioned being has no such \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; considerations. Thoug=\r\nh one may feel and express the pain and other \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objective experiences=\r\n, one reacts to it differently. * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82 \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * This is a key point: Manas and buddhi are g=\r\nood at making \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; objective observations and rational deductions, but, =\r\nby themselves, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; they do not have ANY agenda. They neither like somet=\r\nhing nor dislike \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; something. THAT comes from the conditioning in chi=\r\ntta! The hallmark \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of a jeevanmukta is that THAT is absent! * =C3=82=\r\n  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Whether=\r\n Ramakrishna was a jeevanmukta is a moot question. A better \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; way to =\r\nexpress your question is: Can a jeevanmukta get throat cancer \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and f=\r\neel pain? How is it possible if there are no karmas or rinas \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; left? =\r\nI have already answered it. But, let me sum it up briefly \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; again. Bo=\r\ndy, various body parts, jnanendriyas, karmendiyas, manas and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; buddhi=\r\n of a jeevanmukta continue to operate as before. One&#39;s I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; is in=\r\ntact and does project itself onto those. But neither I-ness nor \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; tho=\r\nse things carry any rinas or karmas. Chitta - the repository of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; con=\r\nditioning and rinas - is clean. There are no limiting notions. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; One&#39;=\r\ns body, indriyas, manas & buddhi keep experiencing and doing \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; things=\r\n (good or bad!) based on the previous momentum set by the play \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of r=\r\nnas and karmas while some conditioning was left in chitta. Body, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; va=\r\nrious body parts, indriyas of jnana and karma and manas are all \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; por=\r\ntions borrowed from various deities. Ahamkara (I-ness) infuses \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sent=\r\nience into them by projecting awareness into them. The \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning=\r\n in chitta is what drives how all these are viewed and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; used. Instea=\r\nd of looking at a sense organ as a portion of Indra or \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Mitra, one v=\r\niews it as &quot;my so and so sense organ&quot;, due to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; conditioning in chitt=\r\na. That is what creates karmas and rinas. When \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that conditioning is=\r\n *completely* overcome, ahamkara can still \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; project awareness into t=\r\nhose objects, but it sees them for what they \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are. It does not have =\r\nfalse and limiting notions like &quot;this throat is \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mine and MUST feel =\r\nnice and not feel painful&quot;. * =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82  =C3=82 * =C3=82  =C3=\r\n=82  =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =C3=82 * Most people who may claim to be (or think they=\r\n are) jeevanmuktas \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are not really jeevanmuktas in today&#39;s world. If=\r\n one wants to \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; understand the state of jeevanmukti, Yoga Vaasishtham=\r\n is the best \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; book. The entire discourse by Maharshi Vasishtha to Lo=\r\nrd Rama is a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; detailed and elaborate definition and characterization=\r\n of a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jeevanmukta. There may be other books that explain better how=\r\n to do \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; various sadhanas to progress spiritually and get closer to b=\r\neing \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; liberated oneday. But, when it comes elaborating what liberati=\r\non \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; while living actually is, there is none better than Yoga Vaasish=\r\ntham. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, one can say that this is merely an intellectual ex=\r\nercise \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; as far as *we* are concerned. It perhaps is, as none of may =\r\never \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; become a jeevanmukta.. One word of caution: I write with a ver=\r\ny \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; confident tone when I have strong conviction in what I write. Tha=\r\nt is \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; how I am. But I can definitely be wrong. So please feel free t=\r\no \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ignore me! :-) Happy Shivaratri (tomorrow night) to all!

N=\r\nothing really, fulfilling all rnas, wait for \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; rnas to be over. Naras=\r\nimha: If a &quot;jeevanmukta&quot; fails in &quot;fulfilling \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; all rnas&quot;, will he b =\r\nbound again? If no, y r they called rnas? If \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; yes, y call him mukta?=\r\n Manish: No, rnas will work out themselves, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; slowly or fast as may b=\r\ne the case. The rnas are of the body he or she \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; occupies. He is mukt=\r\na because he experiences, actually sees the rnas \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to be the body&#39;s o=\r\nnly. Rnas apply to the body, not to you. You are \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that &quot;speck of eff=\r\nulgent light&quot;, call it what you want, Atma, etc. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha: Well, t=\r\nhat speck of effulgent light was never bound. So, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; who exactly bcame=\r\n &quot;mukta&quot;? Did & does he/it have rnas? If these &quot;rnas \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; of body&quot; r som=\r\nehow not fulfilled after one bcomes jeevanmukta, what \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; happens to on=\r\ne? :-) Manish: You are right. The mind thought, that, it \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; was the bo=\r\ndy, instead of this light. That is the original problem. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Which ever=\r\ny being is born with. Rnas arise from this identification \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; which cre=\r\nates karma. U r not that, so u r not bound, when the mind \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; realises =\r\nthis. Became &quot;Mukta&quot; is also not quite true, since u r that \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;Light&quot;=\r\n frm d beginning Narasimha: Then, r the rnas of the &quot;body&quot; as \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; u sai=\r\nd r of the mind? When a mind identifies with light & bcomes \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mukta, =\r\ndoes it hv rnas left? Manish: Ok, karmas projected into mind, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; are a=\r\ncted on and may be experienced by body. So, why is a jeevanmukta \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; su=\r\nbject to this? because, that person although aware of the light at \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nall times, and of the causal n subtle bodies, has not yet directed d \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; mind to identify as that light at all times, key word being &quot;all&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; This gives karmas time to work. Next stage is 24/7 id with light \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nNarasimha: As per my understanding, the person u r defining is not a \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; jeevanmukta. He may b an elevated being, but not mukta (liberated) \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; yet. Manish: I derive that definition of this &quot;state&quot; from somebody, \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; no problem in disagreement. 24/7 identification with light, most \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; likely body should not exist, no? Narasimha: Id with light forever \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; with body dropping off is just mukti, not jivanmukti! Jivanmukti is \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; where body stays. Is body really different from light? In fact, is \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; there anything other than light? Jivanmukti is seeing the play of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; objects but seeing all as light. Mukti & rna are contradictory \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; co=\r\nncepts & cant coexist. U rnt &quot;free&quot; till u pay back what u owe. And \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n that means u dont owe anybody anything once u r truly free. Words \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nlike free, liberated & jivanmukta r often misused. Manish: Will \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; exp=\r\nlain a bit in detail sometime. Narasimha: OK. :-) But, as far as \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &quot;e=\r\nxplaining&quot; is concerned, Vasishtha explained as clearly & \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; elaborate=\r\nly as any human being can ever hope 2. Manish: The question \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; to my m=\r\nind is this: was Ramakrishna a Jeevanmukta? If so, Why did he \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; suffe=\r\nr with throat cancer if he was not identifying with his actions? \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; (a=\r\nccording to your interpretation of Vasistha&#39;s definition??) \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasim=\r\nha: Vasishtha didnt give a single definition. His entire \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; discourse =\r\n2 Rama is a definition of jeevanmukta! Will answer ur RK qn \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; later.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   &lt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&gt;\n&gt; &gt;   &lt;htt=\r\np://docs.yahoo.com/info/terms/&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
