The brahmani - who was Thakur&#39;s guru - had called Ga=\r\nuri for a session of discussion on the spiritual abilities etc of Thakur. N=\r\now Gauri was a very famous debater and a sadhaka=C2=A0who never lost any de=\r\nbate. \n&gt; Plus Thakur used to say that Gauri had remakrable siddhis. He used=\r\n to perform a homa of Ma Kali by stretching out his left hand, piling wood =\r\non the bare=C2=A0arm, lighting it and then using his right hand to pour ghe=\r\ne! And the homa would last for an hour or more and he would keep his left h=\r\nand perfectly still all this while. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; He had a certain siddhi in =\r\nthe use of a mantra of Ma Kali by virtue of which one could never win in a =\r\ndebate=C2=A0against him. Plus he had a deep, resounding voice which Ramakri=\r\nshna described as the &quot;rumbling of clouds&quot;.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; When Gauri entered t=\r\nhe Dakshineshwar temple precinct and saw the Kali temple, he started repeat=\r\ning the mantra mentally. Thakur at that time was coming out of the temple. =\r\nOn seeing Gauri suddenly Ramakrishna started saying that specific mantra (t=\r\nhe one Gauri was chanting) loudly so that Gauri could hear. Gauri, on being=\r\n thus challanged=C2=A0started shouting the mantra even louded. To this Rama=\r\nkrishna felt as if someone had just given him a divine voice and he too thu=\r\nndered back. Gauri was even more amazed. He roared again=C2=A0but Ramakrish=\r\nna roared louder. Finally, suddenly Gauri realized he has lost his voice. A=\r\nnd his siddhi too! \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; At first he was furious with anger and ego b=\r\nut soon he became friends with Ramakrishna. Finally he proclaimed that Rama=\r\nkrishna was He by a fraction of whose power do Avatars come down on earth. =\r\n\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Later one day Gauri came to Ramakrishna asking for his blessing=\r\n to take sanyasa. He quit debating and went away from that place, promising=\r\n that he would not return untill he realized the Self. Thakur also blessed =\r\nhim according.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; That is the effect of Ramakrishna, who w=\r\nas born and brought up in a village in west bengal, who probably could not =\r\neven sign his own name.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is=\r\n Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fri, 20/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_path=\r\nak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; From: vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [ve=\r\ndic-wisdom] Re: Seamless blend - To Narasimha, Siva and others !!!\n&gt; To: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Friday, 20 November, 2009, 2:54 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Kishnendu,\n&gt; \n&gt; I beg pardon for my reply to you=\r\nr message addressed to Siva.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; One more thing friend spirituality is n=\r\not a subject of debate or &gt;discussion but OF REALISATION as i feel.\n&gt; \n&gt; It=\r\n is not inappropriate to debate and discuss even in the matter of Spiritual=\r\nity occasionally.

Sardar Pat=\r\nel is the one for whom i have same love and respect as Thakur Ramakrishna, =\r\nSwami Vivekananda or Narasimha. Why? Because all the 3 were the ideal state=\r\nsman who did us proud not only by effectively countering religious fanatici=\r\nsm but also BECAUSE THEY OPERATED IN THE SPIRIT OF &#39;SARVA DHARMA SAMABHAVA&#39;=\r\n. BIGOTRY CAN NEVER BE ATTACHED TO THEM. And for me this is fantastic and f=\r\nitting to the ideals of Sanatan Dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding Dr=\r\n. Zakir Naik: I did not know about him initially. a year and half back, i v=\r\nisited Oman and there once i switched on TV where in i saw that person on &#39;=\r\nPeace&#39; Channel. He was lecturing in front of a gathering and he used a word=\r\n &#39;Veda&#39; which interested me to go through.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I don&#39;t remember th=\r\ne topic but i felt so much saddened by his lecture. The reason was that he =\r\nkept on attacking Veda/Hinduism and Christianity for proving his points. Im=\r\nmediately in my mind came channels like &#39;Sanskaar&#39; and &#39;Ashta&#39; where a lot =\r\nof religious pundits (most of them are Hindus) come for discourses. and i d=\r\no not remember any instance where in they have attacked any religious senti=\r\nments of other faiths to uphold values of Sanatan Dharma. there is such an =\r\nobvious contrast.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; after that first lecture, i watched Zakir&#39;s other l=\r\nectures and was convinced that this person is not a true spiritual leader b=\r\nut a polished intellectual who essentially is a fanatic and then never stop=\r\nped to see him further. I remember having a debate at the same site (at Oma=\r\nn) with a Young person of Islamic faith. we debated on the issue and i fran=\r\nkly asked him to send Mr. Naik, an email, asking him that does he really be=\r\nlieve that other religions and faith are also true. I must say that, i foun=\r\nd that young Muslim engineer had much more tolerance and understanding than=\r\n Dr Zakir Naik.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The unfortunate part is that the broad minded people =\r\nof today&#39;s generations are getting corrupted by such fanatic leaders.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As i have many Muslim, Chrisitan Friends (Really good fri=\r\nends), i never loose a chance to advocate my views -&quot;The time has come when=\r\n we must not only &#39;respect&#39; the other religious faiths but also we must bel=\r\nive in our heart of hearts that every faith/religion is true and we must ne=\r\nver try to convert people of other religion to our religion but on the cont=\r\nrary we must discourage a person who wants to formally convert by telling h=\r\nim/her that yours is also right and don&#39;t get in to such theatrics.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I absolutely echo Thakur Ramakrsihna- :&quot;as many are paths, as many op=\r\ninion are there&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; About Sri Sri, i must say that i believe h=\r\nim as a great spiritual leader. i&#39;ve some past experiences which makes me b=\r\nelieve that. Now that is the reason i wish to know his views on this partic=\r\nular debate episode. I know he has a great knowledge and he also is a schol=\r\nar but then why he did not counter Dr. Zakir?. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Siva wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; [\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Some clues - AOL silver jubilee with over 2 million people medi=\r\ntating and doing Sudarshan Kriya together happened around Feb 16, 2006.

I feel I have said everything I had to say. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In hind sight, I realize that I should not have ventured to give =\r\nan intellectual explanation for something that I myself have not yet intell=\r\nectually understood.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I did want to object to some statemen=\r\nts saying Sri Sri did not know what do say or was confused.

IMH=\r\nO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; an embodiment of=\r\n the very thing that was supposedly the topic of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; discussion.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If a yogi has such stature, one can do &quot;justice to the t=\r\nopic&quot; without even taking part in the debate and just by being oneself.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When people of little or no un=\r\nderstanding were debating Truth/God and misleading the world, great teacher=\r\ns in the past stepped in and directed the debate in the right direction, wh=\r\nether it is rishis or recently Aadi Shankaracharya or Swami Vivekananda. Th=\r\ney had the knack of steering the debate in a direction that they wanted - a=\r\n direction that would help establish sanatana dharma.

In fact,=\r\n this is a question that was raised by disciples of Sri Sri than those that=\r\n dont know him. In fact, if one looks into it, one will be dumbfounded! How=\r\n is it that somebody like Sri Sri, who has commented exhaustively on severa=\r\nl scriptures, who is an authority on vedanta both by his inner Realization =\r\nand learning, who recited the Bhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old without=\r\n anybody teaching him, and who gives impromptu discourses in various forums=\r\n across the world on all topics under the sun shy away from explaining some=\r\n simple questions that are about his home turf?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Th=\r\ne answer is that Sri Sri did not debate. He never debates on Truth! To him =\r\nTruth / God is not an article of debate. He can show the way to Realization=\r\n of Truth to those that are ready. He is not interested in anything else. H=\r\ne answers only when there is sincerity in the heart of the questioner. Othe=\r\nrwise he would say some polite words and let it pass, however big the occas=\r\nion may be. Most of the questions that were raised in that meeting were ans=\r\nwered elaborately by Sri Sri in his various commentaries & discourses year =\r\nago!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One may ask why then did he go to this meetin=\r\ng or whatever it was? The topic of the meeting was something like &quot;Concept =\r\nof God in Hinduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;B=\r\nEING&quot; an embodiment of the very thing that was supposedly the topic of disc=\r\nussion. Those that were ready to benefit from it from the audience would ha=\r\nve benefited. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ************\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; The below part is not for Rajarshi but may be of interest to everyone, e=\r\nspecially those among us that are intellectually curious about spirituality=\r\n than practicing it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri always practices &quot;ex=\r\nperience first and explanation and knowledge later&quot; principle. Sometimes in=\r\n AOL, there will be big congregation of thousands of people and Sri Sri wil=\r\nl only say very simple things or share some simple jokes and laughs, but hi=\r\ns presence would convey what needs to be conveyed for those that are recept=\r\nive. A Master may not be interested in getting 100,000 people trading one m=\r\nental concept for another, but prefers one sincere person opening up to Tru=\r\nth in silence. A Masters mere presence is enough for that to happen. Words =\r\nare secondary and optional. In spiritual discussions, the point of words is=\r\n to create inner silence or illumination and if that is not created, there =\r\nis no point in talking! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is a great privilege a=\r\nnd an immense blessing to be in the presence of a living Master whether it =\r\nis Sri Sri or someone else. We gain immensely if we listen to them from our=\r\n Being instead of our mind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39; s life, there are innumerab=\r\nle examples of very simple people benefiting from his mere looks & presence=\r\n while big intellectuals would debate with him and miss the opportunity of =\r\na lifetime. Sometimes when he countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna =\r\nwould feign ignorance and say what would I know - I am an illiterate! What =\r\na disaster it would have been for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakris=\r\nhna as an illiterate and ignoramus!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Without an acc=\r\nompanying experience (at least a small glimpse or even a fragment of an exp=\r\nerience) accumulating knowledge can be very dangerous as it will become yet=\r\n another mental concept and will actually be a hindrance to the Sadhak. Som=\r\ne of the most subtle and dangerous hindrances for a sadhak are created by n=\r\none other than the sadhak&#39;s empty concepts of spirituality and God! Things =\r\nlike lust, greed, anger, etc., stand out conspicuously and are in that way =\r\nless dangerous. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nand=\r\ny &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Siva,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail.

Sri Sri Ravishankar maybe an enlightened =\r\nmaster but he just cannot debate.

I occasional=\r\nly visit this forum. I happened to see several emails about AOL and the bel=\r\now email from Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiri=\r\ntual practices and as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want=\r\n to clarify a few things to the extent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several paths each leading to the destination o=\r\nf Sat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, some use dev=\r\notion, etc. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. That d=\r\noes not make it in any way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobin=\r\ndo would call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly=\r\n emerge into SatChitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is transformed sl=\r\nowly and the sadhak radiates more and more as they progress more and more.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a seamless blend =\r\nof Raja yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in =\r\nAOL is not just doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)under=\r\nstood. Pranayams and Sudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing and settling of=\r\n the mind and preparing for meditation and doing other spiritual practices =\r\nof contemplation, Seva for rest of the day wit the right attitude. Regular =\r\npractice of Sudarshan Kriya removes / breaks old patterns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AOL includes some yoga asanas to prepare the body (the =\r\nPadma Sadhana sequence of asanas taught in DSN course and Sun Salutations (=\r\nSurya Namaskar) taught in Part II or advance courses fall under this catego=\r\nry.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The raja yoga practices include all th=\r\ne pranayams, Sudarshan Kriya, mudras, bandhas, meditations taught in Art of=\r\n Living course, advance courses, Sahaj samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Knowledge part includes deep contemplative=\r\n study and imbibing of Narada Bhakti Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtava=\r\nkra Gita and Bhagavat Gita. Sri Sri Ravishankar has given very elaborate co=\r\nmmentary on all of the above. His commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or=\r\n so tapes and the publicly available commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to =\r\nover 33 DVD episodes! Besides daily study of Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommended. Learning and contemplation of this Wisdom is manda=\r\ntory for those that strive to become Art of Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The path of AOL emphasises on Surrender and Seva. Guru p=\r\nuja to Guru parampara, nama sankeertan and bhajans are a standard feature o=\r\nf AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some wonder why AOL charge=\r\ns for these courses and some wonder about lack of a Sadhguru at every stage=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me clarify from my personal experien=\r\nces that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master living in Sahaj =\r\nSamadhi all times. He is capable of guiding millions of devotees in every s=\r\ntep of the sadhana without having to be near them in person. Several get ne=\r\ncessary guidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice), some in pe=\r\nrson and several via various other ways. However, to get these guidance, an=\r\n inner connection with the Master is essential. Until that stage, the vario=\r\nus AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and in-depth commentaries on various Kn=\r\nowledge are more than enough to guide disciples to a stage where conscious =\r\ninner communion with Guru can be established.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Several of the senior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis=\r\n of a very high order capable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness at wi=\r\nll during meditation. They may be not fully established in it like Sri Sri,=\r\n but act as channels of the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as a=\r\nnd when needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept =\r\nthose that left their body as having achieved highest realization such as S=\r\nri Aurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ramana Maharishi. However it is a human =\r\ntendency to doubt them when they are in physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its courses: AOL is world&#39;s l=\r\nargest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL teachers nor its founder Sri=\r\n Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All the proceeds go to the charitab=\r\nle activities again run by volunteers. Many of the full time teachers have =\r\ngiven up veyr lucrative careers and millions worth in property to become te=\r\nachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar neither needs all the money.=\r\n All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri have went through very bad and s=\r\nometimes even dangerous conditions to bring the Knowledge to the masses. Th=\r\nis is a time when the highest Knowledge needs to be revealed to maximum num=\r\nber of people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Senior AOL teachers have fa=\r\nced danger to their lives by going without any help or guidance to areas in=\r\nfested with naxalites, terrorists in North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Palestine, =\r\nPakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. with nothing but love and Divine Grace as their ai=\r\nd.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, money is charged in A=\r\nOL courses for two reasons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experi=\r\nence showed that those that paid for the courses seem to follow the practic=\r\nes more diligently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving person shoul=\r\nd be denied a course because they cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I w=\r\nas part of organizing several AOL courses and know first hand many cases wh=\r\nere people took courses for free and were also provided free accommodation,=\r\n etc. Whenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from =\r\ntheir own pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and provide healing t=\r\no the victims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) This is my understanding and not AOl position. It r=\r\nemoves the Karmic debt to the AOL teachers and volunteers who still may hav=\r\ne some doership in them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, Sri Sri =\r\nis only interested in getting everyone turn inwards and express the love, j=\r\noy and compassion that is inside everyone. As long as one follows a path, a=\r\nny path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, we are happy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       The INTERNET now has a personality.
