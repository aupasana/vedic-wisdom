As Shri=\r\n Narasimha had remarked, if the posters show some discretion on the length,=\r\n frequency and volume of such posts then it&#39;d definitely be more &#39;palatable=\r\n&#39; experience. Just my thoughts and I apologize if this thread had hurt anyo=\r\nne unintentionally. \nRegards,\n-Prasad\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com,=\r\n Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Prasad and Narayan,\n&gt;  \n&gt; One =\r\nmay type mails using one&#39;s own words. But, are they really one&#39;s own words =\r\nand one&#39;s own ideas? One expresses what one has realized based on reading v=\r\narious masters, discussing with one&#39;s guru(s), meditating, contemplating an=\r\nd eventually digesting that knowledge.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Thus, I see nothing wrong in q=\r\nuoting a great saint or a yogi, as opposed to writing one&#39;s own thoughts.\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; I started this list to share my thoughts on various spiritual matters.=\r\n Based on my own experiences, I could finally make sense of various seeming=\r\nly contradictory things I had read. I could put it all together in my mind =\r\nand have a uniform, consistent, coherent and integrated understanding that =\r\nput various things in the correct perspective. I wanted to promote such a w=\r\nholesome and integrated understanding and do my part in &quot;bridging&quot; various =\r\n&quot;islands&quot; of spiritual wisdom that exist out there. The other goal of this =\r\nforum is to remove some fundamental confusions and misunderstandings that m=\r\nay be blocking some people from doing spiritual sadhana and making spiritua=\r\nl progress and encourage some people to do spiritual sadhana.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If word=\r\ns of a great yogi or saint that promote the same goal are shared, I see not=\r\nhing wrong in it. The only thing is I request people to go a bit slow and n=\r\not post too many such mails on the same day. Some people may be overwhelmed=\r\n by the traffic and just delete the mails. One can slowly cover the ground =\r\none wants to cover, over a period of time. So please limit such posts.\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n\n\n\n"}}
