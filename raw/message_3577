People like=\r\n Joseph and those priests who advocate &#39;conversion&#39; in sanatana dharma - ma=\r\ny be even by a small ritual, a formal &#39;feel-good&#39; ritual etc...are saying t=\r\nhat these are conversion rituals and Josephs are believing and feeling-good=\r\n about the same.\n=C2=A0\nIf such things happen without clarity from both the=\r\n actors to the world at large...then sanatana dharma would be also accused =\r\nof conversion like islam and christainity of conversion (it is immaterial h=\r\nere how they do it). Every priest who is probably contacted or every &#39;hindu=\r\n friend&#39; who probably helps and guides in the proceedings should make it am=\r\nply clear that first of all there is nothing like conversion in Sanatana Dh=\r\narma. What the &quot;interested&quot; non-hindus are doing is a simple ritual that ma=\r\nkes him &quot;feel-good&quot; as the end objective is nothing more than that. People =\r\nlike Joseph who are already steeped in the religion may not need that as yo=\r\nu have amply made clear.\n=C2=A0\nComing to the part of people who have bad q=\r\nualities or rather...I would put it as one who is so steeped in materialism=\r\n that even a small bit of spiritual pursuit is out of qusetion or is probab=\r\nly confused about what to do in terms of that...- shouldn&#39;t they be iniitia=\r\nted first? Or should they be &quot;converted&quot;? - the state that they are in will=\r\n make them attached more to the symbolic gesture of &quot;conversion&quot; and make t=\r\nhem first a fanatic and then real spiritual...if at all OR such a symbolic =\r\ngesture may just lead to more confusion and they in turn confuse more and m=\r\nore. The way I perceive...I feel that there would be wrong messaging going =\r\non, in this case to the world.\n=C2=A0\nThe solution to this problem is that =\r\nthe priests can do small formal gestures which are symbolic...without termi=\r\nng them as &quot;conversion&quot; rituals...because that is what is happening today.=\r\n=C2=A0Only then=C2=A0it is a win-win situation.\n=C2=A0\nRegards\nArunisha\n---=\r\n On Sun, 1/24/10, Narasimha P.V.R.

However, if =\r\na ceremony makes one feel good, I am not against it.\n\nIf someone who has be=\r\nen reading scriptures and trying to follow Sanatana dharma for 15 years and=\r\n doing a mantra 1008 times everyday (like Joseph said below) asks me what c=\r\neremony he should do to &quot;convert&quot;, I will tell him &quot;you are already a Hindu=\r\n, i.e. adherent of Sanatana dharma, and a good one at that. There is no nee=\r\nd to do any ceremony.&quot; Even if his name is Joseph and not a Sanskrit name, =\r\nit does not change anything.\n\nHowever, if the same person has already decid=\r\ned to do some ceremony and tells me that he is doing so and so ceremony to =\r\nconvert, I will only wish him good luck and not admonish him for doing thos=\r\ne ceremonies.\n\nBottomline is that shastras do not teach any procedures for =\r\n&quot;converting&quot; someone into Hinduism. After all, the question of &quot;conversion&quot;=\r\n does not arise in &quot;vasudhaiva kutumbakam&quot; philosophy that says that the wh=\r\nole world is one family! However, some priests may come up with some proced=\r\nures. Let them do so. Why should we stop them? We do so many things in life=\r\n that are not really needed. What is the harm in a nice ceremony where a Sa=\r\nnskrit name is formally given and various childhood, teenage and adult sams=\r\nkaras are done to an adult symbolically?\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nIf anybody is t=\r\nhinking of &quot;converting&quot; non-Hindus to sanatana dharma or converting passive=\r\n Hindus into active Hindus or better Hindus, I can suggest a simple approac=\r\nh. Give a Vaidik/Pouranik mantra (any) to the person, ask him/her to chant =\r\nit everyday and give a nice spiritual book to read. When you find a suitabl=\r\ne person, you can also give a sacred thread, teach Mahaganapathi homam and =\r\nask the person to do it every day or week.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nPlease remember=\r\n one important thing. Supose there is a good Christian or Muslim or Zoroast=\r\nrian or Buddhist who is dedicated to one&#39;s religion, who is calm at heart, =\r\nwho sees the whole world as a sacred creation of an almighty god (whatever =\r\nthe name may be), who sees all beings as embodiments of god and deals with =\r\nthem with love and respect, who is very thoughtful and responsible in decid=\r\ning his own actions and very considerate and forgiving in responding to oth=\r\ner people&#39;s actions. Such a person is dhaarmik and a good follower of sanat=\r\nana dharma despite the name of the religion he follows and the name of the =\r\ngod he worships. There is no need to &quot;convert&quot; such a person.\n\nIf someone i=\r\ns not as described above and has bad qualities, one can try to convert such=\r\n a person into one who follows dharma better by either introducing him to t=\r\nhe teachings of rishis and well-known practices of &quot;Hinduism&quot; OR simply by =\r\ndirecting him to the true meaning of the teachings of the messiahs in his o=\r\nwn *formal* religion.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software=\r\n, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals f=\r\nor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.=\r\nVedicAst rologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference:=\r\n http://SaraswatiFil ms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://=\r\ngroups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://grou=\r\nps. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n--- On Fri, 1/22/10, arunisha sengup=\r\nta &lt;arunishasengupta@ yahoo.com&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: arunisha sengupta &lt;arunishas=\r\nengupta@ yahoo.com&gt;\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Reg.Conversion of relig=\r\nion\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\nDate: Friday, January 22, 2010, 3:53=\r\n AM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\n\n\n\n\n\nDear All and also Joseph,\n=C2=A0\nAfter reading the mail=\r\n...if you have understood that there is no need for any ceremonies then wha=\r\nt does this below mail mean in the 1st place?

Our shastras define sanatana dharma - the perennial path of righ=\r\nteous duty. Sanatana dharma is not an exclusive property of people born to =\r\n&quot;Hindu&quot; parents. Sanatana dharma belongs to the entire world and encompasse=\r\ns every human being whether or not one realizes it!\n\nSome people who consid=\r\ner themselves Hindus may or may not be following dharma well.\n\nThere may no=\r\nt be much difference between somebody from another religion with a strong i=\r\nnterest in &quot;Hinduism&quot; and somebody born to Hindu parents but having either =\r\npassive interest or disinterest in Sanatana dharma and teachings of rishis.=\r\n In fact, the former may be a better adherent of Sanatana dharma than the l=\r\natter in some cases! If there is no need to convert the latter to &quot;Hinduism=\r\n&quot;, there is no need to convert the former either!\n\nSeveral ceremonies like =\r\nnaamakarana samskaara (naming) are more social customs than dharmik matters=\r\n.\n\nIn my opinion, if a person is given a Vedic or Pouraanik mantra (any) by=\r\n a decent guru and asked to chant it everyday for an amount of time, and if=\r\n he/she is exposed to some scripture (e.g. Gita, Upanishads etc) and asked =\r\nto read it, understand it and let it affect one&#39;s thinking, I think one is =\r\nthen a Hindu, i.e. one will soon find oneself adhering to Sanatana dharma. =\r\nThere is no need for any ceremonies.\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n\nIn fact, now there ar=\r\ne some &quot;foreigners&quot; who perform a homam every weekend, to Ganapathi, Krishn=\r\na etc. If anybody thinks they are not &quot;Hindus&quot;, one is not thinking straigh=\r\nt. They are more Hindus than many Hindus in India who have forgotten their =\r\ndharma.\n\nA braahmana&#39;s dharma is to pursue spiritual progress and engage th=\r\ne mind in the god for the benefit of the world. One who does not spend time=\r\n in japam or homam for the benefit of the world is not a braahmana. If a fo=\r\nreigner is passionately interested in spiritual progress and does japam or =\r\nhomam every day or week for the benefit of the world and one&#39;s own spiritua=\r\nl upliftment, such a foreigner is not only a Hindu, but also a braahmana.\n\n=\r\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- --------- -\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons,=\r\n Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitr=\r\ni Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.=\r\norg \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group=\r\n/vedic- wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/Jyo=\r\ntishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------=\r\n- --------- -\n\n--- On Thu, 1/21/10, gurukkal.shankar &lt;gurukkal.shankar@ yah=\r\noo.in&gt; wrote:\n\n\nFrom: gurukkal.shankar &lt;gurukkal.shankar@ yahoo.in&gt;\nSubject=\r\n: [vedic-wisdom] Reg.Conversion of religion\nTo: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. =\r\ncom\nDate: Thursday, January 21, 2010, 12:04 PM\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\nRespected Narasim=\r\nha sir,\n\nIam refering to the recent news of a foreigner being converted in =\r\nto hinduism at Rameshwaram, since he is very much interested in our sastras=\r\n etc..,\n\nWhether this is sanctioned in our scripts.if so what all the samsk=\r\naras to be undertaken.whether a new horoscope is to be written,namakarana e=\r\ntc.,kindly enlighten.\n\nwith respectes,\n\nS.Ravi Shankar\n\n\n\n\nThe INTERNET now=\r\n has a personality.

After all, the question\n of &quot;conversion&quot; does =\r\nnot arise in &quot;vasudhaiva kutumbakam&quot; philosophy that says that the whole wo=\r\nrld is one family! However, some priests may come up with some procedures. =\r\nLet them do so. Why should we stop them? We do so many things in life that =\r\nare not really needed. What is the harm in a nice ceremony where a Sanskrit=\r\n name is formally given and various childhood, teenage and adult samskaras =\r\nare done to an adult symbolically?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If anybody =\r\nis thinking of &quot;converting&quot; non-Hindus to sanatana dharma or converting pas=\r\nsive Hindus into active Hindus or better Hindus, I can suggest a simple app=\r\nroach. Give a Vaidik/Pouranik mantra (any) to the person, ask him/her to ch=\r\nant it everyday and give a nice spiritual book to read. When you find a sui=\r\ntable person, you can also give a sacred thread, teach Mahaganapathi homam =\r\nand ask the person to do it every day or\n week.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Please remember one important thing. Supose there is a good Christian or =\r\nMuslim or Zoroastrian or Buddhist who is dedicated to one&#39;s religion, who i=\r\ns calm at heart, who sees the whole world as a sacred creation of an almigh=\r\nty god (whatever the name may be), who sees all beings as embodiments of go=\r\nd and deals with them with love and respect, who is very thoughtful and res=\r\nponsible in deciding his own actions and very considerate and forgiving in =\r\nresponding to other people&#39;s actions. Such a person is dhaarmik and a good =\r\nfollower of sanatana dharma despite the name of the religion he follows and=\r\n the name of the god he worships. There is no need to &quot;convert&quot; such a pers=\r\non.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If someone is not as described above and has bad qualities, one =\r\ncan try to convert such a person into one who follows dharma better by eith=\r\ner introducing him to the\n teachings of rishis and well-known practices of =\r\n&quot;Hinduism&quot; OR simply by directing him to the true meaning of the teachings =\r\nof the messiahs in his own *formal* religion.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Naras=\r\nimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- -&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writ=\r\nings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/v=\r\nedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/Jy=\r\notishWri tings&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Fri, 1/22/10, arunisha sengupta &lt;I&gt;&lt;a=\r\nrunishasengupta@\n yahoo.com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BOR=\r\nDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: arunisha sengupta &lt;arunishasen=\r\ngupta@ yahoo.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Reg.Conversion of r=\r\neligion&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Friday, January 22, =\r\n2010, 3:53 AM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv82313328&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3D=\r\nygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n&lt;TBODY&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY: inherit; font-size-adjust: inherit; font-st=\r\nretch: inherit&quot; vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear All and also Joseph,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;After reading the mail...if you have understood that there i=\r\ns no need for any ceremonies then what does this below mail mean in the 1st=\r\n place?

Ou=\r\nr shastras define sanatana dharma - the perennial path of righteous duty. S=\r\nanatana dharma is not an exclusive property of people born to &quot;Hindu&quot; paren=\r\nts. Sanatana dharma belongs to the entire world and encompasses every human=\r\n being whether or not one realizes it!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some people who consider them=\r\nselves Hindus may or may not be following dharma well.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There may not=\r\n be much difference between somebody from another religion with a strong in=\r\nterest in &quot;Hinduism&quot; and somebody born to Hindu parents but having either p=\r\nassive interest or disinterest in Sanatana dharma and teachings of rishis. =\r\nIn fact, the former may be a better adherent of Sanatana dharma than the la=\r\ntter in some cases! If there is no need to convert the latter to &quot;Hinduism&quot;=\r\n, there is no need to convert the former\n either!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Several ceremonies=\r\n like naamakarana samskaara (naming) are more social customs than dharmik m=\r\natters.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In my opinion, if a person is given a Vedic or Pouraanik man=\r\ntra (any) by a decent guru and asked to chant it everyday for an amount of =\r\ntime, and if he/she is exposed to some scripture (e.g. Gita, Upanishads etc=\r\n) and asked to read it, understand it and let it affect one&#39;s thinking, I t=\r\nhink one is then a Hindu, i.e. one will soon find oneself adhering to Sanat=\r\nana dharma. There is no need for any ceremonies.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;In fact, now there are some &quot;foreigners&quot; who perform a homam every weeke=\r\nnd, to Ganapathi, Krishna etc. If anybody thinks they are not &quot;Hindus&quot;, one=\r\n is not thinking straight. They are more Hindus than many Hindus in India w=\r\nho have forgotten their dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A braahmana&#39;s dharma is to pursue sp=\r\niritual progress and engage the\n mind in the god for the benefit of the wor=\r\nld. One who does not spend time in japam or homam for the benefit of the wo=\r\nrld is not a braahmana. If a foreigner is passionately interested in spirit=\r\nual progress and does japam or homam every day or week for the benefit of t=\r\nhe world and one&#39;s own spiritual upliftment, such a foreigner is not only a=\r\n Hindu, but also a braahmana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;--------=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp=\r\n; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It =\r\nYourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;A class=3Dmoz-txt-link-freetext href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicas=\r\nt/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Films that make a difference: &lt;A class=3Dmoz-txt-li=\r\nnk-freetext\n href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifil/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;h=\r\nttp://SaraswatiFil&lt;/A&gt; ms.org &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: &lt;A=\r\n class=3Dmoz-txt-link-freetext href=3D&quot;http://groups/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups&lt;/A&gt;. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; Jyo=\r\ntish writings: &lt;A class=3Dmoz-txt-link-freetext href=3D&quot;http://groups/&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups&lt;/A&gt;. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri =\r\ntings&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ -&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Thu, 1/21/10, gurukkal.shankar &lt;I&gt;&lt;A class=3Dmoz-=\r\ntxt-link-rfc2396E href=3D&quot;http://us.mc1111.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dg=\r\nurukkal.shankar@...&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;&lt;gurukkal.shank=\r\nar@ yahoo.in&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: r=\r\ngb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: gurukkal.shankar &lt;gurukkal.shankar@ y=\r\nahoo.in&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Reg.Conversion of religion&lt;BR&gt;To: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Thursday, January 21, 2010, 12:04 PM&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1297534391&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;Respected Narasimha sir,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Iam refering to the recent news of a fo=\r\nreigner being converted in to hinduism at Rameshwaram, since he is very muc=\r\nh interested in our sastras etc..,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Whether this is sanctioned in our=\r\n scripts.if so what all the samskaras to be undertaken.whether a new horosc=\r\nope is to be written,namakarana etc.,kindly enlighten.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;with respecte=\r\ns,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;S.Ravi Shankar&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/=\r\nTBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABL=\r\nE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;HR SIZE=3D1&gt;\nThe INTERNET now has a personality.
