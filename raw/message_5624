Braahmana is not made by birth but by samskaras, attitude and conduct. Today&#39;s caste system is a very bad replica of varnashrama dharma of yore. Most people who call themselves braahmanas today are NOT braahmanas. Very few true braahmanas exist today and some of them are not braahmanas by standard definition of birth family and surname!\n \nWhen Krishna says that Vedic knowledge can be taught and rituals can be performed for others, ONLY by braahmanas, he means a braahmana by conduct. He clarifies further by describing the value system and conduct of a braahmana.\n \n*        *        *\n \nSwami Vivekananda was fond the story of Satyakama from Chandogyopanishad. When Satyakama went to Maharshi Goutama to learn Veda, maharshi asked him who his father was and what his gotra was. He replied that he was born when his mother Jabala was working as a servant maid in many houses and she did not know who the father of her child was. So he did not know his father and his gotra. Impressed, Maharshi Goutama declared that one committed to truth and honesty MUST be a braahmana irrespective of parentage and accepted to teach him Veda! Varna is decided by the samskaras and conduct and not by birth.\n \n*        *        *\n \nTeaching Vedic knowledge and performing rituals for others are two braahminical karmas that can never be sold as per Lord Krishna. One engaging in these activities can only take what is voluntarily given, and live meagrely within that. If that is not enough and one needs more money, Lord Krishna said that a braahmana can use the vaisya profession in addition and buy and sell *material* things to sustain oneself. But he did not suggest selling Vedic knowledge and rituals.\n \nIf you are selling other material things (e.g. your software knowledge or any material goods), that is fine. As long as you do not sell Jyotish knowledge or ritual performance, you are doing fine with that divine knowledge. In fact, based on what you said, you are more of a braahmana than many people who call themselves braahmanas. Forget about your birth and keep doing what you are doing.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIn fact, a lot of non-braahmanas (by samskaras and conduct and NOT by surname) are flourishing in the fields of Jyotish and rituals today due to shortage of true braahmanas (by samskaras and conduct and NOT by surname), though they are breaking Lord Krishna&#39;s guidelines. The situation can be remedied only if more people start following Lord Krishna&#39;s words and transform into true braahmanas engaging in Vedic knowledge. If you do that, you will slowly get the blessings of rishis and become better at Jyotish and rituals. If your samskaras impel you in that direction, start walking irrespective of your surname and what family you were born in. Who knows, you may be a true braahmana in the making.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBottomline: Your birth caste does NOT matter. You are doing a much better job of following Lord Krishna&#39;s guidelines on the conduct of braahmanas than many people and keep going without any self-doubts! I am sorry if I created any confusion for you.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In JyotishGroup@yahoogroups.com, &quot;C.S.

Should I stop my Jyotish activity, as Vedic knowledge can *only*\n&gt; be taught or Jyotish be practised by a Brahmin only as it is a vedic\n&gt; knowledge?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.

The question is what Braahmana should do\n&gt; &gt; in the absence of such patronage.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Lord Krishna&#39;s words in SrimadBhagavatam 11.17 to Sri Uddhava give clear\n&gt; &gt; guidance in this matter (see http://vedabase.net/sb/11/17/ for original\n&gt; &gt; Sanskrita verses).\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; SB 11.17.41: A brahmana who considers that accepting charity from others\n&gt; &gt; will destroy his austerity and spiritual purity should maintain himself by\n&gt; &gt; the other two brahminical occupations, namely teaching Vedic knowledge and\n&gt; &gt; performing sacrifice. If the brahmana considers that those two occupations\n&gt; &gt; also compromise his spiritual position, then he should collect rejected\n&gt; &gt; grains in agricultural fields and live without any dependence on others.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; SB 11.17.42: The body of a brahmana is not intended to enjoy insignificant\n&gt; &gt; material sense gratification; rather, by accepting difficult austerities in\n&gt; &gt; his life, a brahmana will enjoy unlimited happiness after death.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; SB 11.17.43: A brahmana householder should remain satisfied in mind by\n&gt; &gt; gleaning rejected grains from agricultural fields and marketplaces. Keeping\n&gt; &gt; himself free of personal desire, he should practice magnanimous religious\n&gt; &gt; principles, with consciousness absorbed in Me. In this way a brahmana may\n&gt; &gt; stay at home as a householder without very much attachment and thus achieve\n&gt; &gt; liberation.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; SB 11.17.47: If a brahmana cannot support himself through his regular\n&gt; &gt; duties and is thus suffering, he may adopt the occupation of a merchant and\n&gt; &gt; overcome his destitute condition by buying and selling *MATERIAL* things. If\n&gt; &gt; he continues to suffer extreme poverty even as a merchant, then he may adopt\n&gt; &gt; the occupation of a kshatriya, taking sword in hand. But he cannot in any\n&gt; &gt; circumstances become a shudra.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one carefully reads SrimadBhagavatam 11.17, there is no confusion on\n&gt; &gt; what a Braahmana can and cannot do with Vedic knowledge. Accepting royal\n&gt; &gt; grants and other charity given voluntarily by others to support a braahmana\n&gt; &gt; (when one is satisfied with the spiritual purity of the giver) is fine.\n&gt; &gt; Teaching Jyotish and other Vedic knowledge and performing rituals and taking\n&gt; &gt; voluntary donation (when one is satisfied with the spiritual purity of the\n&gt; &gt; giver) is fine.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Otherwise, when not enough money is generated through Vedic teaching and\n&gt; &gt; rituals and one is suffering, buying and selling material things (e.g.\n&gt; &gt; mathematics knowledge, software, TVs, accounting services etc) to support\n&gt; &gt; oneself is fine.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; But, setting price on Jyotish knowledge or other Vedic knowledge or rituals\n&gt; &gt; performed for gods is NOT fine for a *braahmana*. There cannot be two\n&gt; &gt; opinions on this, as the Lord Himself spoke clearly to Uddhava in this\n&gt; &gt; manner!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regarding the clause above &quot;when one is satisfied with the spiritual purity\n&gt; &gt; of the giver&quot;, an example:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Swami Brahmananda was the spiritual son of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and a\n&gt; &gt; friend of Lord Krishna in a previous incarnation as per Ramakrishna. When he\n&gt; &gt; was the head of the Ramakrishna mission, a rich man came to them. He wanted\n&gt; &gt; to renounce and donate his entire wealth to Ramakrishna mission. Swami\n&gt; &gt; Brahmananda determined that taking that money would taint them and he\n&gt; &gt; refused!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If some people are charging fixed fees for performing rituals like poojas\n&gt; &gt; and homas and abhishekas to relieve people of their problems or charging\n&gt; &gt; fixed fees for teaching Jyotish or giving Jyotish readings, it is their\n&gt; &gt; prerogative and we cannot (and should not) force them to change. One\n&gt; &gt; performs one&#39;s own karmas and reaps the fruits - tasty and bitter - of one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; own karmas. Others cannot change it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, we can say that they are NOT being braahmanas, as per the\n&gt; &gt; guidelines of Lord Krishna.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Though SB 11.17.40 says that Vedic knowledge can be taught and rituals can\n&gt; &gt; be performed *only* by Braahmanas (here braahmana means one following the\n&gt; &gt; code of conduct of a braahmana and not just one born in a so-called brahmana\n&gt; &gt; family), we seem to have a huge number of NON-braahmanas (by conduct and not\n&gt; &gt; necessarily by birth) who are *selling* Jyotish knowledge and ritual\n&gt; &gt; performance. It is not surprising, this being deepening Kali yuga!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; The best way to deal with them is not to attack them or call them names. If\n&gt; &gt; you want to buy what they are selling, buy it. If not, ignore them, leave\n&gt; &gt; them to their own fate and move on. YOU can follow the words of Lord, if you\n&gt; &gt; have faith in Lord. But there is no need to impose them on others. Leave\n&gt; &gt; that to Lord!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n"}}
