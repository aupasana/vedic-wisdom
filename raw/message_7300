We can safely assu=\r\nme that no human in this age can completely understand the exact esoteric s=\r\nignificance of each verse,=C3=82=C2=A0let alone=C3=82=C2=A0each word of the=\r\n Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; But the potency of the text is due to it bein=\r\ng a revealed text, even if one does not understand a single word of it and =\r\nyet keeps chanting it, results will come unfailing! There are a few explana=\r\ntory books of the Chandi by many esteemed spiritual people, the most famous=\r\n being that by Sri Nagoji Bhatta and Sri Bhaskaracharya. In Bengali there a=\r\nre=C3=82=C2=A0quite a=C3=82=C2=A0few=C3=82=C2=A0very beautiful texts provid=\r\ning different interpretations of the Chandi, but sadly none of them are in =\r\nEnglish.

I am completing the last time =\r\non the Chaturdasi before the Navaratris begin. During Navaratris I plan to =\r\nperform Chandi Homam with 700 verses. Currently I am doing Chandi Homam dai=\r\nly with only Durga Sapta Sloki because I am doing chanting otherwise. Sapta=\r\n Sati, tough as it seemed in the beginning, became a lot more easier for me=\r\n to chant now (that was the objective with which I have taken up this 108 t=\r\nimes pArAyaNam) and some day I plan to memorize all that. On this occasion,=\r\n I have a question for Shri Narasimha Garu. I have come across a writing so=\r\nmewhere on Sapta Sati as to how it can be a mantra Sastra. The second verse=\r\n &quot;SavarniH Soorya TanayOH .....&quot; was interpreted to as &quot;Hreem..&quot; beejakshar=\r\na mantra. Do we have a book that explains all of the SaptaSati in several c=\r\nontexts, the literal meaning, esoteric\n&gt; &gt; meaning, the several mantras tha=\r\nt the verses represent etc.? If there is no book like that, I would request=\r\n Shri PVR to author such a book because of his deep insights into the subje=\r\nct/language and the advanced sadhaka that he is! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nagraj\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
