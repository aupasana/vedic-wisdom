THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE REAL PRINCIPLE\n\n3. The objects of knowledge,=\r\n viz., sound, touch, etc., which are perceived\nin the waking state, are dif=\r\nferent from each other because of their\npeculiarities; but the consciousnes=\r\ns of these, which is different from them,\ndoes not differ because of its ho=\r\nmogeneity.\n\n4. Similar is the case in the dream state. Here the perceived o=\r\nbjects are\ntransient and in the waking state they seem permanent. So there =\r\nis\ndifference between them.But the (perceiving) consciousness in both the\ns=\r\ntates does not differ. It is homogeneous.\n\n11. If the supreme bliss of the =\r\nSelf is not known, there cannot be the\nhighest love for it. (But it is ther=\r\ne). If it is known, there cannot be\nattraction for worldly objects.(That to=\r\no is there). So we say, this blissful\nnature of the Self, though revealed, =\r\nis not (strictly speaking) revealed.\n\n15. Prakriti (i.e. primordial substan=\r\nce) is that in which there is the\nreflection of Brahman, that is pure consc=\r\niousness and bliss and is composed\nof sattva, rajas and tamas (in a state o=\r\nf homogeneity). It is of two kinds.\n\n16. When the element of sattva is pure=\r\n, Prakriti is known as Maya; when\nimpure\n(being mixed up with rajas and tam=\r\nas) it is called Avidya. Brahman,\nreflected in\nMaya, is known as the omnisc=\r\nient Isvara, who controls Maya.\n\n17. But the other (i.e. the Jiva, which is=\r\n Brahman reflected in Avidya) is\nsubjected to Avidya (impure sattva). The J=\r\niva is of different grades due to\n(degrees of) admixture (of rajas and tama=\r\ns with sattva). The Avidya\n(nescience) is the causal body. When the Jiva id=\r\nentifies himself with this\ncausal body he is called Prajna.\n\n18. At the com=\r\nmand of Isvara (and) for the experience of Prajna the five\nsubtle elements,=\r\n ether, air, fire, water and earth, arose from the part of\nPrakriti in whic=\r\nh tamas predominates.\n\n19. From the sattva part of the five subtle elements=\r\n of Prakriti arose in\nturn the five subtle sensory organs of hearing, touch=\r\n, sight, taste and\nsmell.\n\n20. From a combination of them all (i.e. sattva =\r\nportions of the five subtle\nelements) arose the organ of inner conception c=\r\nalled antahkarana. Due to\ndifference of function it is divided into two. Ma=\r\nnas (mind) is that aspect\nwhose function is doubting and buddhi (intellect)=\r\n is that whose functions\nare discrimination and determination.\n\n21. From th=\r\ne rajas portion of the five elements arose in turn the organs of\nactions kn=\r\nown as the organ of speech, the hands, the feet, and the organs of\nexcretio=\r\nn and generation.\n\n22. From a combination of them all (i.e. the rajas porti=\r\nons of the five\nsubtle elements) arose the vital air (Prana). Again, due to=\r\n difference of\nfunction it is divided into five. They are Prana, Apana, Sam=\r\nana, Udana and\nVyana.\n\n23. The five sensory organs, the five organs of acti=\r\non, the five vital airs,\nmind and intellect, all the seventeen together for=\r\nm the subtle body, which\nis called the Suksma or linga sarira.\n\n24. By iden=\r\ntifying himself with the subtle body (and thinking it to be his\nown), Prajn=\r\na becomes known as Taijasa, and Isvara as Hiranyagarbha. Their\ndifference i=\r\ns the one between the individual and the collective (i.e. one is\nidentified=\r\n with a single subtle body and the other with the totality of\nsubtle bodies=\r\n).\n\n25. Isvara (as Hiranyagarbha) is called totality because of his sense o=\r\nf\nidentification with all the subtle bodies (of the universe). The other (t=\r\nhe\nTaijasa) is called =E2=80=98individual=E2=80=9D because it lacks this kn=\r\nowledge (and is\nconscious only of his self, being identified with his own s=\r\nubtle body).\n\n26. To provide the Jivas with objects of enjoyment and make t=\r\nhe bodies fit\nfor such\nenjoyment, the all-powerful Isvara has made each of =\r\nthe (subtle) elements\npartake\nof the nature of all others.\n\n27. Dividing ea=\r\nch element into two equal halves and one half of each again\ninto four (equa=\r\nl parts) the Lord mixed the subtle elements so that each\ngross element thus=\r\n formed should contain one half of its own peculiar nature\nand one eighth o=\r\nf that of each of the other four.\n\n28. From these composite elements the co=\r\nsmic egg arose, and from it evolved\nall the\nworlds as well as all the objec=\r\nts of experience and the bodies in which the\nexperience take place. When Hi=\r\nranyagarbha identifies himself with the\ntotality of gross bodies he is know=\r\nn as Vaisvanara; when Taijasas do so with\nindividual gross bodies (e.g.) of=\r\n the devas, men or lower animals, they are\nknown as Visvas.\n\n29. They see o=\r\nnly external things and are devoid of the knowledge of their\ntrue inner\nnat=\r\nure. They perform actions for enjoyment, and again they enjoy for\nperformin=\r\ng\naction.\n\n30. They go from birth to birth, as worms that have slipped into=\r\n a river are\nswept from one whirlpool to another and never attain peace.\n\n3=\r\n1. When the good deeds performed by them in past births bear fruit, the\nwor=\r\nms\nenjoy rest being lifted from the river by a compassionate person and pla=\r\nced\nunder\nthe shade of a tree on the bank.\n\n32. Similarly, the Jivas (findi=\r\nng themselves in the whirlpool of samsara),\nreceive the appropriate initiat=\r\nion from a teacher who himself has realised\nBrahman, and\ndifferentiating th=\r\ne Self from its five sheaths attain the supreme bliss of\nrelease.\n\n33. The =\r\nfive sheaths of the Self are those of the food, the vital air, the\nmind, th=\r\ne\nintellect and bliss. Enveloped in them, it forgets its real nature and\nbe=\r\ncomes subject to transmigration.\n\n45. When the supreme Brahman superimposes=\r\n on Itself Avidya, that is, sattva\nmixed\nwith rajas and tamas, creating des=\r\nires and activities in It, then it is\nreferred to as =E2=80=98thou=E2=80=99=\r\n.\n\n46. When the three mutually contradictory aspects of Maya are rejected,\n=\r\nthere\nremains the one individual Brahman whose nature is existence, conscio=\r\nusness\nand\nbliss. This is pointed out by the great saying &#39;That thou art=E2=\r\n=80=99.\n\n53. The finding out or discovery of the true significance of the i=\r\ndentity of\nthe\nindividual self and the Supreme with the aid of the great sa=\r\nyings (like\nTattvamasi) is what is known as sravana. And to arrive at the p=\r\nossibility of\nits validity through\nlogical reasoning is what is called mana=\r\nna.\n\n54. And, when by sravana and manana the mind develops a firm and undou=\r\nbted\nconviction, and dwells constantly on the thus ascertained Self alone, =\r\nit is\ncalled unbroken meditation (nididhyasana).\n\n55. When the mind gradual=\r\nly leaves off the ideas of the meditator and the\nact of\nmeditation and is m=\r\nerged in the sole object of meditation. (viz., the Self),\nand is\nsteady lik=\r\ne the flame of a lamp in a breezeless spot, it is called the\nsuper-consciou=\r\ns state (samadhi).\n\nII. THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE FIVE ELEMENTS\n\n10. The v=\r\narious actions of man can be classified into five groups; speech,\ngrasping,=\r\n\nmovement, excretion and enjoyment of sexual intercourse. Action performed =\r\nin\nagriculture, commerce, service and so forth may be included into one or\n=\r\nother of the\ngroups.\n\n13. The mind enquires into the merits and defects of =\r\nthe objects which are\nperceived\nby the senses. Sattva, rajas and tamas are =\r\nits three constituents, for\nthrough them\nthe mind undergoes various modific=\r\nations.\n\n20. Differences are of three kinds: The difference of a tree from =\r\nits\nleaves, flowers,fruits etc., is the difference within an object. The\ndi=\r\nfference of one tree from another tree is the difference between objects\nof=\r\n the same class. The difference of a tree from a stone is the difference\nbe=\r\ntween objects of different classes.\n\n59. With Brahman as its basis, Maya cr=\r\neates the various objects of the\nworld, just as\na variety of pictures are d=\r\nrawn on a wall by the use of different colours.\n\nSource: http://www.celexte=\r\nl.org/othervedantabooks/panchadasi.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00235429d6b8902b0c04a3ea18f7\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nTranslated by Swami Swahananda Published by Sri Ramakrishna Math=\r\n, Chennai&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;I. THE DIFFERENTIATION OF=\r\n THE REAL PRINCIPLE&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;3. The o=\r\nbjects of knowledge, viz., sound, touch, etc., which are perceived in the w=\r\naking state, are different from each other because of their peculiarities; =\r\nbut the consciousness of these, which is different from them, does not diff=\r\ner because of its homogeneity.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:b=\r\nold&quot;&gt;4. Similar is the case in the dream state. Here the perceived objects =\r\nare transient and in the waking state they seem permanent. So there is diff=\r\nerence between them.But the (perceiving) consciousness in both the states d=\r\noes not differ. It is homogeneous.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;11. If the supreme bliss=\r\n of the Self is not known, there cannot be the highest love for it. (But it=\r\n is there). If it is known, there cannot be attraction for worldly objects.=\r\n(That too is there). So we say, this blissful nature of the Self, though re=\r\nvealed, is not (strictly speaking) revealed.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-w=\r\neight:bold&quot;&gt;15. Prakriti (i.e. primordial substance) is that in which there=\r\n is the reflection of Brahman, that is pure consciousness and bliss and is =\r\ncomposed of sattva, rajas and tamas (in a state of homogeneity). It is of t=\r\nwo kinds.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;16. When the element of sattva is pure, Prakriti is know=\r\nn as Maya; when impure&lt;br&gt;(being mixed up with rajas and tamas) it is calle=\r\nd Avidya. Brahman, reflected in&lt;br&gt;Maya, is known as the omniscient Isvara,=\r\n who controls Maya.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;17. But the other (i.e. the Jiva, which is Bra=\r\nhman reflected in Avidya) is subjected to Avidya (impure sattva). The Jiva =\r\nis of different grades due to (degrees of) admixture (of rajas and tamas wi=\r\nth sattva). The Avidya (nescience) is the causal body. When the Jiva identi=\r\nfies himself with this causal body he is called Prajna.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;18. At the command of Isvara (and) for the ex=\r\nperience of Prajna the five subtle elements, ether, air, fire, water and ea=\r\nrth, arose from the part of Prakriti in which tamas predominates.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\n19. From the sattva part of the five subtle elements of Prakriti arose in t=\r\nurn the five subtle sensory organs of hearing, touch, sight, taste and smel=\r\nl.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;20. From a combination of=\r\n them all (i.e. sattva portions of the five subtle elements) arose the orga=\r\nn of inner conception called antahkarana. Due to difference of function it =\r\nis divided into two. Manas (mind) is that aspect whose function is doubting=\r\n and buddhi (intellect) is that whose functions are discrimination and dete=\r\nrmination.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;21. From the ra=\r\njas portion of the five elements arose in turn the organs of actions known =\r\nas the organ of speech, the hands, the feet, and the organs of excretion an=\r\nd generation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;22. From a c=\r\nombination of them all (i.e. the rajas portions of the five subtle elements=\r\n) arose the vital air (Prana). Again, due to difference of function it is d=\r\nivided into five. They are Prana, Apana, Samana, Udana and Vyana.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;23. The five sensory organs, the fi=\r\nve organs of action, the five vital airs, mind and intellect, all the seven=\r\nteen together form the subtle body, which is called the Suksma or linga sar=\r\nira.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;24. By identifying hi=\r\nmself with the subtle body (and thinking it to be his own), Prajna becomes =\r\nknown as Taijasa, and Isvara as Hiranyagarbha. Their difference is the one =\r\nbetween the individual and the collective (i.e. one is identified with a si=\r\nngle subtle body and the other with the totality of subtle bodies).=C2=A0&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;25. Isvara (as Hiranyagarbha) is called totality because of =\r\nhis sense of identification with all the subtle bodies (of the universe). T=\r\nhe other (the Taijasa) is called =E2=80=98individual=E2=80=9D because it la=\r\ncks this knowledge (and is conscious only of his self, being identified wit=\r\nh his own subtle body).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;26. To provide the Jivas with objects of e=\r\nnjoyment and make the bodies fit for such&lt;br&gt;enjoyment, the all-powerful Is=\r\nvara has made each of the (subtle) elements partake&lt;br&gt;of the nature of all=\r\n others.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;27. Dividing each element =\r\ninto two equal halves and one half of each again into four (equal parts) th=\r\ne Lord mixed the subtle elements so that each gross element thus formed sho=\r\nuld contain one half of its own peculiar nature and one eighth of that of e=\r\nach of the other four.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;28. From these composite elements the cosmi=\r\nc egg arose, and from it evolved all the&lt;br&gt;worlds as well as all the objec=\r\nts of experience and the bodies in which the experience take place. When Hi=\r\nranyagarbha identifies himself with the totality of gross bodies he is know=\r\nn as Vaisvanara; when Taijasas do so with individual gross bodies (e.g.) of=\r\n the devas, men or lower animals, they are known as Visvas.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;29. Th=\r\ney see only external things and are devoid of the knowledge of their true i=\r\nnner&lt;br&gt;nature. They perform actions for enjoyment, and again they enjoy fo=\r\nr performing&lt;br&gt;action.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;30. =\r\nThey go from birth to birth, as worms that have slipped into a river are sw=\r\nept from one whirlpool to another and never attain peace.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;31. When=\r\n the good deeds performed by them in past births bear fruit, the worms&lt;br&gt;e=\r\nnjoy rest being lifted from the river by a compassionate person and placed =\r\nunder&lt;br&gt;the shade of a tree on the bank.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;32. Similarly, the =\r\nJivas (finding themselves in the whirlpool of samsara), receive the appropr=\r\niate initiation from a teacher who himself has realised Brahman, and&lt;br&gt;\n\nd=\r\nifferentiating the Self from its five sheaths attain the supreme bliss of r=\r\nelease.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;33. The five sheaths of the Self are those of the food, the =\r\nvital air, the mind, the&lt;br&gt;intellect and bliss. Enveloped in them, it forg=\r\nets its real nature and becomes subject to transmigration.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;45. Whe=\r\nn the supreme Brahman superimposes on Itself Avidya, that is, sattva mixed&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;with rajas and tamas, creating desires and activities in It, then it is =\r\nreferred to as =E2=80=98thou=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;46. When the three mutually c=\r\nontradictory aspects of Maya are rejected, there&lt;br&gt;\n\nremains the one indiv=\r\nidual Brahman whose nature is existence, consciousness and&lt;br&gt;bliss. This i=\r\ns pointed out by the great saying &#39;That thou art=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;53. T=\r\nhe finding out or discovery of the true significance of the identity of the=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n\nindividual self and the Supreme with the aid of the great sayings (li=\r\nke Tattvamasi) is what is known as sravana. And to arrive at the possibilit=\r\ny of its validity through&lt;br&gt;logical reasoning is what is called manana.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;54. And, when by sravana and manana=\r\n the mind develops a firm and undoubted conviction, and dwells constantly o=\r\nn the thus ascertained Self alone, it is called unbroken meditation (nididh=\r\nyasana).&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;55. When the mind gradually leaves off the ideas of the m=\r\neditator and the act of&lt;br&gt;meditation and is merged in the sole object of m=\r\neditation. (viz., the Self), and is&lt;br&gt;steady like the flame of a lamp in a=\r\n breezeless spot, it is called the super-conscious state (samadhi).&lt;/span&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;II. THE DIFFERENTIATION OF THE FI=\r\nVE ELEMENTS&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;10. The various actions of man can be classified =\r\ninto five groups; speech, grasping,&lt;br&gt;movement, excretion and enjoyment of=\r\n sexual intercourse. Action performed in&lt;br&gt;\n\nagriculture, commerce, servic=\r\ne and so forth may be included into one or other of the&lt;br&gt;groups.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1=\r\n3. The mind enquires into the merits and defects of the objects which are p=\r\nerceived&lt;br&gt;by the senses. Sattva, rajas and tamas are its three constituen=\r\nts, for through them&lt;br&gt;\n\nthe mind undergoes various modifications.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n20. Differences are of three kinds: The difference of a tree from its leave=\r\ns, flowers,fruits etc., is the difference within an object. The difference =\r\nof one tree from another tree is the difference between objects of the same=\r\n class. The difference of a tree from a stone is the difference between obj=\r\nects of different classes.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;59.
