After sending the message, I get blank message =\r\nad lost all the matter that I typed. So, I am re-typing. \n\nSri Narasimha&#39;s =\r\nexplanation on this thread is brilliant, as it is always. I began beleiving=\r\n that he is a great Sadhaka as well, since his words inspire me a lot. I al=\r\nso started fearing as to how much bad karma I am accumulating by consuming =\r\nthis commercial milk from SamsClub / Walmart and so on grocery stores withi=\r\nn the US. Although the organic milk is available in the US, it is so much m=\r\nore expensive and unaffordable to me, to buy on a regular basis. And my fat=\r\ne is such that I even do the abhishekam to my Lord, SadaShiva, using the sa=\r\nme milk, every monday. What is the way out? Is there a way we can get rid o=\r\nf this bad karma that we keep accumulating every day, knowlingly some/unkno=\r\nwingly some? Is there a way we can measure the amount of bad karma we alrea=\r\ndy have and do appropriate remedies? I know constantly doing Sandhyavandana=\r\nm, regularly doing Homam, Mantra japam etc. is one way, but how to measure =\r\nhow much you need to do to get rid of the bad karma and how to avoid accumu=\r\nlation of new bad karma?\n\nAlso, is consumption of alcohol (social drinking =\r\nor otherwise) also a bad karma and if so, is it as bad as or worse than con=\r\nsuming non veg food? I know most puranas strongly advise against any consum=\r\nption of alcohol, but there are no strict dos and donts on anything in our =\r\nVedantic Tradition, in my opinion. I could be wrong and ready to be correct=\r\ned. \n\nNagraj\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@.=\r\n..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.=\r\n Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Your line of thinking i=\r\ns good. Faith is needed in religion, but corruptions do take place and it i=\r\ns useful to question. Blind faith in some things is useful to make progress=\r\n, but one cannot place blind faith in everything attributed to a religion a=\r\nnd shun logic completely. Truth is arrived at by a combination of reason an=\r\nd faith. Without faith, only reason cannot take one to the highest truths. =\r\nWithout reason, blind faith cannot take one to the highest truths, especial=\r\nly if one starts off with faith in wrong notions (e.g. one may believe that=\r\n you reach god if you kill people not belonging to one&#39;s religion).\n&gt; &gt; =A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Fortunate is one who finds the right balance between faith and reason,=\r\n uses reason to find the right notions to place faith in and makes quick pr=\r\nogress.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; =A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; (1) In practical physical terms, cow milk is a simple and nutritious f=\r\nood with plenty of poteins and easy to digest. It is very saattwik and has =\r\nmany useful properties as per ayurveda.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; However, if you replace=\r\n cows that live a relaxed lifestyle feeding in open grasslands on grass and=\r\n leaves with cows that live a hectic and stressful lifestyle in congested f=\r\nactories feeding on chicken etc, the gunas of milk are considerably differe=\r\nnt. It&#39;s not the same anymore.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; A cow can produce more milk than=\r\n what is needed by its calf. People in the old days never deprived calves o=\r\nf mother&#39;s milk and took milk after the calf was fed. Instead, if one depri=\r\nves the calf and steals all the milk (like many factories may be doing), th=\r\nat karma will follow the milk and go to various people handling, using and =\r\nconsuming that milk, in different proportions.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; (2) Yes, a cloth=\r\n made of silk carries a lot of negative karma. Putting so many worms in boi=\r\nling water and killing them is negative karma. I feel far more comfortable =\r\nputting in homam fire a cotton cloth made from a tree than putting a silk c=\r\nloth made by killing many worms. Though silk clothes are fashionable in rel=\r\nigious ceremonies now, one cannot be sure whether this was a custom in anci=\r\nent times or the current silk is a substitute for another kind of cloth mad=\r\ne non-violently in ancient times.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; When people cannot find somet=\r\nhing that is used traditionally, they try to find a substitute to feel good=\r\n that they are following the customs. If they do not clearly understand the=\r\n motivation/rationale/spirit behind a custom, they may end up with a bad su=\r\nbstitute. For example, I have seen people decorating idols with nice lookin=\r\ng plastic flowers and plastic flower garlands. Plastic is a really bad subs=\r\ntitute for a real flower. People only use them for decorating idols and do =\r\nnot put them in homam fire, but who knows, people may start offering plasti=\r\nc flowers in homam fire after a few hundred years.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Like that, s=\r\nilk clothes may have come into usage as a bad substitute for something else=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; (3) Supreme god understands everything.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; The purpo=\r\nse of a mantra is not for requesting god for a specific thing. The purpose =\r\nof a mantra is to stabilize an overactive mind and focus it on something. M=\r\nind is like a monkey jumping up and down and running here and there. Mantra=\r\n is like a rope that ties it to a fixed pole (a deity or a focus point). As=\r\n one tries to focus the mind on a deity/mantra and give up all other though=\r\nts, a moment will come (perhaps after minutes of sadhana or hours or days o=\r\nr years or lives) when mind will let all other thoughts go. Mind will then =\r\nreverberate with the mantra, with no other thoughts in it whatsoever. One f=\r\norgets oneself completely and gets absorbed in the mantra *fully*. That is =\r\nwhen one *experiences* a mantra and a deity.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Such a thing is po=\r\nssible with any combination of sounds. One can repeat &quot;I bow to the holy fa=\r\nther&quot; for ever and reach such a state.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; However, depending on th=\r\ne mantra being repeated in the mind and the deity being focused on, the exp=\r\nerience of the mind when the mantra fills the mind and all other thoughts c=\r\nease will be different. Different mantras will give different experiences. =\r\nVarious deities, their Sanskrit mantras and beejas were experimented by man=\r\ny great yogis before us and well-understood by ancients. If you want to tie=\r\n a monkey to a pole, any rope can be used. But, if a rope was tested before=\r\n, it may be good to use that rope.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Secondly, arrangement of sou=\r\nnds in Sanskrit alphabet has a deep significance and correlation to the sub=\r\ntle body. Different sounds are vibrating in different parts of the subtle b=\r\nody. Sanskrit alphabet and mantras are constructed beautifully. When one&#39;s =\r\nself-awareness ascends from the regular plane of consciousness, one can exp=\r\nerience other realms of consciousness that are vibrating with different sou=\r\nnds. Sanskrit captures that well.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Thirdly, each tangible articl=\r\ne (such as a book or an email or a mantra) has some remnants of the energy =\r\nof persons who associated with it. When I say a specific combination of wor=\r\nds, it may have one impact on you. When a saint says the same combination o=\r\nf words with the same tone, it may have another impact on you. A sentence o=\r\nne writes when one is in a bad mood or bad spiritual state may not have any=\r\n impact on readers. A sentence one writes in a very good state of mind afte=\r\nr a lot of sadhana and control over mind may inspire readers more\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; That is because one&#39;s shakti works through one&#39;s words and other tangibl=\r\ne actions. For this reason, mantras that were composed by great yogis or us=\r\ned by great yogis are touched by their shakti and may end up storing some o=\r\nf their shakti. One using such a mantra has a chance to capture a little of=\r\n that shakti. That is why one feels good energy when one chants mantras com=\r\nposed by great souls like Adi Shankara.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; So it is a good idea to=\r\n use well-known Sanskrit mantras that were used by generations of great sai=\r\nnts and yogis.\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; =A0 Free Jyotish So=\r\nftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual=\r\n manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0 Fi=\r\nlms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt; =A0=A0=A0=A0 Spi=\r\nrituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; =A0 Jyotish writi=\r\nngs: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; --------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 12/=\r\n17/09, ramypras &lt;ramypras@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; From: ramypras &lt;ramypras@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subje=\r\nct: [vedic-wisdom] Basic queries\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; D=\r\nate: Thursday, December 17, 2009, 12:02 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;     \n&gt; &gt;       \n&gt; &gt;       \n&gt;=\r\n &gt;       Namaskara!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have some very basic questions and=\r\n was not convinced by answers that are usually given.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1.=\r\n How can milk be considered pious? I understand that Cow is a divinely bein=\r\ng and is worshiped as `Kamadenu&#39;. But in actual sense we are extracting mil=\r\nk and preventing the calf from having its share of milk...Is this not a sin=\r\n to stop a young calf from having milk from its mother?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n2. How can silk cloth be considered sacred for worship? Silk is obtained by=\r\n killing thousand&#39;s of cocoon. Using a product which is obtained by killing=\r\n so many living beings and we being a cause for such an action...Are we not=\r\n doing sin?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. I tell my daily prayers but I have not le=\r\narnt Sanskrit and don&#39;t understand the meaning of many prayers that I say e=\r\nveryday. Why is it necessary to say the slokas in Sanskrit and not other la=\r\nnguage??\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Will our Supreme Lord not understand other languages ?? o=\r\nr is it just bcos Sanskrit has been used from the very early times it is st=\r\nill in practice.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ~Ramya\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
