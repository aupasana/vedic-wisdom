I will reply to them together.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nRegarding mail 1 below on priests:\n&gt; \n&gt; Doing rituals for one&#39;s own upliftm=\r\nent is one thing and doing it for others is another. In the former, one is =\r\ncleaning up a dirty place that one is forced to live in. In the latter, one=\r\n is going to someone else&#39;s dirty place and cleaning it up. If there is som=\r\ne radioactive waste there and one is not protected, one may be affected.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; As I keep saying, results of one&#39;s previous karmas are like fruits lying=\r\n in a basket. One takes out one fruit after another and eats them. Some may=\r\n be tasty and some may be bitter or rotten. When one does rituals and other=\r\n spiritual sadhana, the deities throw away some bad fruits into a trash can=\r\n and make one eat good fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be some=\r\n spillage as dirty fruits are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the ri=\r\ntual, he may be affected by the spillage.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the old days, priests did=\r\n intense sadhana and generated enough purity to handle such things. Many pr=\r\niests of today do not do enough penance. They are quite vulnerable as they =\r\nstart messing with other people&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly, many priests of to=\r\nday who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to a brahmana f=\r\nather is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become a brahmana ones=\r\nelf. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-like. Many br=\r\nahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of money or of co=\r\nmforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. They are no=\r\nt really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas on earth rig=\r\nht now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for others only by=\r\n brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influence, money a=\r\nnd comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; is there any rem=\r\nedy for this?\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, stop doing rituals for others. Or, do enough indiv=\r\nidual penance when you are not doing rituals for others. Moreover, try to f=\r\nollow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and=\r\n aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandala=\r\ns, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding mail 2 below =\r\non astrologers:\n&gt; \n&gt; This is not an immature comment and there is an elemen=\r\nt of truth in it. A lot of what I said above applies here too.\n&gt; \n&gt; Every a=\r\nction performed with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces an equal r=\r\neaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action of giving advice to someone resulted in =\r\nthat person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing Z i=\r\nnstead of W in coming years, there is clearly an action here. If the astrol=\r\noger has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to experience t=\r\nhe fruits of it. Some blessings can come and some sufferings can come too.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s karmas is always a risky business.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wh=\r\nat is the solution? Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a br=\r\nahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to=\r\n truly become a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, ks=\r\nhatriyas and vaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, on=\r\ne will become a brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified =\r\nto play with the karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by cond=\r\nucting rituals. Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by bir=\r\nth, but about brahmanas by conduct.\n&gt; \n&gt; The above will become clear, if yo=\r\nu look at the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can =\r\nbe taught Jyotish!\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -----------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n&gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish M=\r\nP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals f=\r\nor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Films =\r\nthat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; Spirituality: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.c=\r\nom/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------=\r\n----------\n&gt; \n&gt; Mail 1:\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wro=\r\nte: \n&gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any curse(Shapam)?\n&gt; &gt; This I=\r\n am asking after seeing the overall and general condition of Brahmanas spec=\r\nially those who do pujas for Yajmanas and involved in Karmakanda.\n&gt; &gt; And i=\r\nf this is true is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; I think this is the only p=\r\nlace where we can discuss this subject hence I am posting this query here.T=\r\nhanks a lot in advance.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mail 2:\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other educat=\r\ned Scholars,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s)=\r\n mp3 training sessions and am very eager to review my own chart. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nHowever in numerous instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and c=\r\nlose uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse impact on yourself (as=\r\ntrologer) and yrou family.
