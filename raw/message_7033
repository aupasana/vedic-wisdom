However, in their forms as specific individuals like=\r\n Vivekananda, whether\n&gt; these amsa attain the specific stages which makes a=\r\n siddha/nath/muni/rishi\n&gt; will determine if they are to be called so. .. th=\r\ne only way a person can be\n&gt; called a siddha in true sense is when he, as V=\r\nimalananda puts it, &quot;picks\n&gt; a petal&quot;, (some specific shaktis) an &quot;orbit&quot; a=\r\nnd moves closer to the\n&gt; Centre and yet not merging into it, deeper and dee=\r\nper.\n=C2=A0\nHow do you know that Vivekananda, Yogananda etc did not do that=\r\n (or possibly even more)? Because they did not mention &quot;I did so and so&quot; us=\r\ning the same terminology used by Vimalananda? Or because they did not show =\r\nthe same kind of external siddhis that impressed you in Vimalananda (like s=\r\nucking mercury in vajroli and bring it out from hair)?\n=C2=A0\nHow do you su=\r\nppose you can reliably conclude when someone has &quot;attained the specific sta=\r\nges&quot;?

He ga=\r\nve the analogy of a bird that lays eggs at a very high altitude. While the =\r\negg is still falling, it hatches, bird comes out and starts flying right aw=\r\nay. He said these Nithya Siddhas (like Vivekananda) are like that, ever fre=\r\ne and never deluded by maya.\n=C2=A0\nTHAT, my friend, is a great siddhi too.=\r\n Siddhis are defined relative to maya and isn&#39;t it a siddhi to be untouched=\r\n maya? People who are so focused on the external seek to see siddhis in ext=\r\nernal things only and forget that the biggest siddhi one can get is interna=\r\nl!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Added to this the fact that Vivekananda=\r\n was very clear, just as all the\n&gt; disciples of Ramakrshna were clear, that=\r\n Ramakrishna was a special\n&gt; spiritual being, and higher than them. Here to=\r\no I see no confusion.\n=C2=A0\nWell, they not only regarded him as &quot;higher th=\r\nan them&quot;, but they also regarded him as the highest. They regarded him as t=\r\nhe Supreme Being himself. You, on the other hand, are regarding him as a &quot;p=\r\naramahamsa&quot;, who according to you is &quot;lower&quot; than &quot;siddhas, nathas and rish=\r\nis&quot;.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\n&gt; I am merely quoting and putting togethe=\r\nr the analysis, statements of\n&gt; spiritually great people. It is not as comp=\r\nlex as you think! \n&gt; Saying that A is fatter than B, based one statements a=\r\nnd quotes from people who\n&gt; maybe in the know of things, is hardly a judgem=\r\nent. It could very well be a fact. \n=C2=A0\nFatness is external and judgable=\r\n. Internal things (e.g. A is happier than B) cannot be judged the same way.=\r\n Same with spiritual attainment (siddhi=3Dattainment). It is internal and n=\r\not observable externally.\n=C2=A0\n&gt; For an ordinary man, all saints maybe eq=\r\nually elevated. For Yogis, there maybe\n&gt; subtle differences and depths. The=\r\n truth lies in the nuances.\n=C2=A0\nAnd you believe that you are a good yogi=\r\n who has mastered the subtle differences and depths and nuances, to judge g=\r\nreats? Don&#39;t tell me you are blindly following a great yogi and so you must=\r\n be correct. &quot;Nuances&quot; and &quot;subtleties&quot; cannot be grasped by one who merely=\r\n reads and quotes!!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nYour whole premise is base=\r\nd on mixing up terms which may be used by different people in a different s=\r\nense (e.g. Paramahamsa =3D highest soul) and using external factors to judg=\r\ne one&#39;s spiritual caliber.\n=C2=A0\nMy two main messages:\n=C2=A0\n(1) One need=\r\n not pursue siddhis. Siddhis are not a measure of one&#39;s spiritual progress =\r\nand neither necessary nor sufficient for liberation.\n(2) It is unwise to pa=\r\nss judgments on yogis like Vivekananda. Ramakrishna never tolerated anyone =\r\nspeaking anything slightly critical of Vivekananda as he regarded Vivekanan=\r\nda as Narayana himself. Why not give him the benefit of doubt and direct yo=\r\nur critical faculty and discrimination at somebody/something else?

And it sounds quite logical to me. The exponential as I told you, was =\r\nan approximation and nothing more, since you kept pestering for a &#39;formula&#39;=\r\n. BTW, Vimalananda even goes to extent of mentioning a Nath may takes thous=\r\nands of years of sadhana to pulled into a Muni and similarly a Muni may tak=\r\ne &quot;billions&quot; of years of sadhana to become a Rishi, IF, a higher being deci=\r\ndes to pull them forward. Else they can keep staying in their ever &#39;orbits&#39;=\r\n around the center, very close, yet not merging. \n=C2=A0 \n&lt;&lt; \nNow, Ramakris=\r\nhna himself said that Vivekananda and six other sishyas were &quot;Ishwara Koti&quot;=\r\n or &quot;Nitya Siddhas&quot;. Can you tell me where this falls on Vimalananda&#39;s scal=\r\ne? What do you think &quot;Nithya Siddha&quot; (nithya=3Deternal) means? Is it Siddha=\r\n or Mahasiddha or even greater or in between? If six disciples were &quot;Nithya=\r\n Siddhas&quot; and Ramakrishna is &quot;greater&quot; as you say, can he be a &quot;Paramahamsa=\r\n&quot; on this scale, i.e. lower than them?&gt;&gt; \n=C2=A0 \nSimple! Ramakrishna says =\r\nVivekananda was a part of a Rishi who came down. An amsa is not a Rishi in =\r\nfullforce, but sufficient part of the Rishi&#39;s consciousness that comes down=\r\n for a secific purpose and once the purpose is served, goes back to the sou=\r\nrce. Similar for the 6 Nitya-Siddhas. Therefore, very technically, Swami Vi=\r\nvekananda is an *amsa* of a Rishi, a projection of a Rishi. Not the Rishi i=\r\ns full. BTW, all of these Siddhas, Naths, Munis etc are projection Rishis o=\r\nne way or the other. Each is kept is ingorance of their real being (Rishi) =\r\nsuch that the play can go on (not my words, Vimalananda&#39;s words). They are =\r\nNitya-siddha because even if they take birth over and over, being parts of =\r\nextremely higher beings, these emanations/projections/amsas will surely eve=\r\nntually go back to the source when the work is done. \n=C2=A0 \nHowever, in t=\r\nheir forms as specific individuals like Vivekananda, whether these amsa att=\r\nain the specific stages which makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi will determine=\r\n if they are to be called so. They may not need to do so since they are her=\r\ne for a purpose. But, the only way a person can be called a siddha in true =\r\nsense is when he, as Vimalananda puts it, &quot;picks a petal&quot;, (some specific s=\r\nhaktis) an &quot;orbit&quot; and moves closer to the Centre and yet not merging into =\r\nit, deeper and deeper.=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0 \nThere is a book of conversations betw=\r\neen Totapuri and a certain sadhaka (his disciple) when Totapuri lived in Pu=\r\nri. He used to stay in the Swargadwara smashana and later someone build a s=\r\nmall ashram for him. Totapuri&#39;s ashram still exists in Puri. In that conver=\r\nsation, Totapuri also mentions a similar ideas of what is a siddha and high=\r\ner. And how only a Siddha and none less is a true Vigyani. He further menti=\r\nons that Swami Vivekananda did not (need) to go to the stage of a Siddha. H=\r\nis work was specific, he did the work and went off. He did not need to and =\r\ntherefore did not become a Siddha. I see zero confusion here. \n=C2=A0 \nAdde=\r\nd to this the fact that Vivekananda was very clear, just as all the discipl=\r\nes of Ramakrshna were clear, that Ramakrishna was a special spiritual being=\r\n, and higher than them. Here too I see no confusion. \n=C2=A0 \n&lt;&lt;It is not n=\r\necessary that there is a clear order of greatness. Infinity is neither grea=\r\nter than nor less than nor equal to infinity.&gt;. \n=C2=A0 \nThis is what I cal=\r\nl approximation. For an ordinary man, all saints maybe equally elevated. Fo=\r\nr Yogis, there maybe subtle differences and depths. The truth lies in the n=\r\nuances. Anyway, Vivekananda&#39;s own words are more reliable for me than yours=\r\n on this matter. And my previous explanation actually clarifies this statem=\r\nent of Sri Ramakrishna that Vivekananda was the &quot;ancient Rishis Nara&quot; who c=\r\name down for the good of mankind. \n=C2=A0 \n&lt;&lt;Wise men tread cautiously and =\r\ndo not rush to judgment on others.&gt;&gt; \n=C2=A0 \nI am merely quoting and putti=\r\nng together the analysis, statements of spiritually great people. It is not=\r\n as complex as you think! Saying that A is fatter than B, based one stateme=\r\nnts and quotes from people who maybe in the know of things, is hardly a jud=\r\ngement.

Only very higher level beings can attain the same. Since the topic o=\r\nf siddhis did come up, Vimalananda&#39;s ability to suck up a ton of mercury by=\r\n Vajroli and bring it out from his hair infront of someone of Vishudhananda=\r\n&#39;s spiritual calibre, is not a easy feat. This is not a run-of-the-mill sid=\r\ndhi. \n=C2=A0 \n3) I never compared Vimalananda with Ramakrishna, but with Ra=\r\nmakrishna&#39;s disciples. That is a crucial difference.=C2=A0 My comparisons a=\r\nre always based NOT on my understanding, but clear words of great spiritual=\r\n people. That is why I am 100 perecent clear that Ramakrishna is spirituall=\r\ny higher than a Vivekananada or an Abhedananda. You may not want to judge t=\r\nhem., thats your point of view. I on the other hand would rather rely on th=\r\ne clear words of Vivekananda and Abhedananda on this matter rather than spe=\r\nculation. Both Vivekananda and Abhedananda used to say Ramakrishna is their=\r\n Guru and spiritually far higher than they were. \n=C2=A0 \n4) Whether Ramakr=\r\nishna was a paramhamsa or a siddha in Vimalananda&#39;s scale is merely your sp=\r\neculation. Vimalananda&#39;s books however betray no such speculation. I would =\r\nrather rely on the words of the book. \n=C2=A0 \n5) In this age everyone like=\r\ns to take a title for himself. Many spiritual people name themselves Rishis=\r\n, and we know it they are not.=C2=A0 So the Nityananda comparison does not =\r\nstand. Vimalananda on his part never used any titles, not even the term Gur=\r\nu. I base my judgement of this man on a) critical study of the books b) Man=\r\nish&#39;s words. And I have not found you giving any sound logic for why I shou=\r\nld change the same. \n=C2=A0 \n6) If you do not want to compare spiritual peo=\r\nple, that is perfectly fine. I or anyone else is not forcing you. However, =\r\nthat does not mean the world will not do so, specially when the great spiri=\r\ntual people themselves have clearly done so on different occassions. Viveka=\r\nnanda says Ramakrishna a greater spiritual man. I take his words as true.

This=\r\n is a delicate area where many have misconceptions and I will try to addres=\r\ns them. \n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nMaharshi Vasishtha&#39;s teaching to =\r\nLord Rama is clear in Yoga Vaasishtham. The goal of existence and sadhana i=\r\ns self-realization. Siddhis are to be neither specifically sought nor speci=\r\nfically avoided, by a seeker of Self. If Nature gives one some siddhi(s), o=\r\nne should accept them with neither excitement nor disappointment. But one s=\r\nhould NOT run after them, for they are neither necessary nor sufficient for=\r\n self-realization and liberation. \n=C2=A0 \nVivekananda used the same princi=\r\nple when Ramakirishna proposed to give his siddhis to Vivekananda. He asked=\r\n whether the siddhis will enable him to realize god. Ramakrishna said no. V=\r\nivekananda firmly declined the offer then! Of course, when Ramakrishna gave=\r\n them anyway later, he accepted them. Vivekananda&#39;s two actions demonstrate=\r\n Vasishtha&#39;s instructions well. \n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nLet us use=\r\n the analogy of climbing a hill. Climbing hill is one&#39;s spiritual sadhana. =\r\nReaching the top is liberation. Different people climb the hill from differ=\r\nent sides and using different paths. There may be trees with nice fruits on=\r\n the sides of the road. They are siddhis or special abilities. \n=C2=A0 \nIf =\r\none gets distracted, starts climbing the trees and collecting fruits, one&#39;s=\r\n journey gets delayed and one may not reach the top. That is why Vasishtha =\r\nsays a seeker of Self does not pursue any siddhis. \n=C2=A0 \nBut if some fru=\r\nits fall in one&#39;s lap by themselves, one can keep them. Similarly, siddhis =\r\nthat come to one by themselves can be accepted by a seeker of Self. \n=C2=A0=\r\n \nNow an important distinction: \n=C2=A0 \nThere are some trees that are foun=\r\nd at lower altitudes also, but some really special trees are found at very =\r\nhigh altitudes only. If one has such a fruit, it shows that one has climbed=\r\n great heights. Similarly, some siddhis do not mean much, but some siddhis =\r\nare very special and only really elevated sadhakas can obtain them (whether=\r\n by trying or without trying). If a sadhakas demonstrates such a siddhi, yo=\r\nu can see that one progressed a lot. However, the key is that one who climb=\r\ned the same or more distance may not have that or any other fruit. \n=C2=A0 =\r\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nUnlike in the example of climbing hill, which is=\r\n an external activity, spiritual progress in real life is *internal*. There=\r\n is NO way for anyone to know for sure how much progress one has made, how =\r\nmuch self-control one has internally and what exactly goes on in one&#39;s mind=\r\n. We may try to judge it from external factors such as actions, words etc, =\r\nbut it is not necessarily accurate. \n=C2=A0 \nHere, some people swayed by si=\r\nddhis may be tempted to use one&#39;s siddhis to judge how high one climbed. Bu=\r\nt that is faulty. One person who reached the absolute top may not have any =\r\nfruits, while one person who still has ways to climb may have gotten some r=\r\neally nice fruit. Using externaslly demonstrable siddhis that are neither n=\r\necessary nor sufficient for Self-realization as a measure of one&#39;s progress=\r\n is unsound. \n=C2=A0 \nGiven that spiritual progress is internal, how can we=\r\n judge it and compare people then? Well, we need not and should not. Only a=\r\n sarvaantaryaami - a perfected being who has access to each being&#39;s interna=\r\nl state - can do that. \n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nRajarshi, you are a=\r\nssuming that Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is a Paramahamsa on Vimalananda&#39;s scal=\r\ne. You are concluding that Ramakrishna is a Paramahamsa; Abhedananda, Vivek=\r\nananda etc are lower than that; Vimalananda is a rishi; and hence Vimalanan=\r\nda is superior to Abhedananda and Vivekananda by 2pwr16 to 2. \n=C2=A0 \nIs P=\r\naramahamsa Nithyananda, who was caught in a sex scandal, also a Paramahamsa=\r\n because he is known so? See, how people are famously known may or may not =\r\nreflect their spiritual stature. Real spiritual stature is internal and you=\r\n cannot see it. \n=C2=A0 \nWe do not know who Ramakrishna Paramahamsa really =\r\nis. He may not be just a paramahamsa on Vimalananda&#39;s scale, but be a siddh=\r\na or a natha or even a rishi. He may even be Vishnu himself, as he himself =\r\nsaid and some religious experts of that time declared based on various sign=\r\ns. If Ramakrishna Paramahamsa is Vishnu himself, Vivekananda, Abhedananda e=\r\ntc can definitely be rishis or naths in Vimalananda&#39;s scale. If your argume=\r\nnt is that they cannot be because they did not demonstrate siddhis compatib=\r\nle with that status, that is a non-point as I explained above. The disagree=\r\nment between then boils down a difference in the relevance and importance o=\r\nf externally demonstrated siddhis. \n=C2=A0 \n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 * \n=C2=A0 \nWhy thi=\r\ns is relevant and I spent some time on this is that some people seem to hav=\r\ne misconceptions. The take home for some people from some books describing =\r\nmiracles and siddhis may be that siddhis are important. \n=C2=A0 \nVasishtha =\r\nis not only a rishi, but one of saptarshis. Please read what he taught Lord=\r\n Rama in Yoga Vaasishtham. It is the essence of Veda and Upanishad. It will=\r\n balance your views and mould your attitude. Read Yoga Vaasishtham. Siddhis=\r\n are neither necessary nor sufficient for self-realization. Don&#39;t be distra=\r\ncted by them or be infatuated with them. \n=C2=A0 \nThe goal of sadhana is th=\r\nat your notions of &quot;this is I and these are mine&quot; get subtler and subtler a=\r\nnd hold of six internal enemies on you becomes weaker and weaker. Others ma=\r\ny or may not be able to see and judge your progress, but you know your prog=\r\nress and weaknesses the best. THAT is the crux and siddhis have no relevanc=\r\ne or meaning. Any fascination for them will set you back in your sadhana. \n=\r\n=C2=A0 \nBest regards, \nNarasimha \n-----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------- \n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Less=\r\nons, Jyotish Writings, \n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and=\r\n Pitri Tarpana: \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.VedicAstrologer.or=\r\ng \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiF=\r\nilms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/gr=\r\noup/vedic-wisdom \n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/Jy=\r\notishWritings \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Twitter ID: @h=\r\nomam108 \n------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n- \n=C2=A0 \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;=\r\n wrote: \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste friends, \n&gt; \n&gt; There was a long friendly ;-) exchange=\r\n between Rajarshi and me on Friday \n&gt; (July 29) on twitter on measuring spi=\r\nritual caliber. This came from the \n&gt; context of Rajarshi&#39;s comments on the=\r\n &quot;maturity&quot; & &quot;errors&quot; of \n&gt; Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples (regarding their attit=\r\nude towards Tantra). He \n&gt; compared them with Vimalananda and said their sp=\r\niritual caliber was of \n&gt; the scale of 2, while Vimalananda&#39;s was 2 power 1=\r\n6. He also talked about \n&gt; the hierarchy of spiritual caliber mentioned by =\r\nV. I want to share 2 \n&gt; cents of musings on that. \n&gt; \n&gt; -------------------=\r\n------------ \n&gt; Measuring Spiritual Caliber \n&gt; \n&gt; Rajarshi, here are a few =\r\ncomments on your statements a couple of days \n&gt; back on Twitter comparing s=\r\npiritual caliber. We can&#39;t even compare \n&gt; flowers like hibiscus, rose, jas=\r\nmine, mogra, kewda, lotus etc & say \n&gt; which is a better flower. They have =\r\ndifferent properties like color, \n&gt; size, shape, number of petals, type/int=\r\nensity of smell etc. Relative \n&gt; values depend on the purpose and they cann=\r\not be quantified universally. \n&gt; How can any sane person then say that spir=\r\nitual caliber of different \n&gt; people can be compared and quanitified? The f=\r\nield of duality has \n&gt; infinite variety and the [self-]control of a yogi ha=\r\ns infinite aspects \n&gt; to it. You cannot quantify the spiritual caliber of a=\r\n person as one \n&gt; number and compare them. \n&gt; \n&gt; Before one even attempts t=\r\no understand Vimalananda&#39;s order (Paramahamsa \n&gt; &lt; Siddha &lt; Natha &lt; Rishi),=\r\n please note that different hierarchies exist \n&gt; in scriptures for deities =\r\nalso. Some consider a hierarchy of deities \n&gt; where Vishnu is supreme. Some=\r\n consider a hierarchy of deities where \n&gt; Shiva is supreme. Some consider a=\r\n hierarchy of deities where Shakti is \n&gt; supreme. And so on. None of them i=\r\ns absolute. All of them are relative \n&gt; and for specific purposes, i.e. fro=\r\nm a specific perspective. There are \n&gt; people who take them as absolute and=\r\n argue that so and so thing taught \n&gt; by Vishnu is superior to so and so th=\r\ning taught by Shiva, etc. But we \n&gt; know that none of the hierarchies is ab=\r\nsolute. \n&gt; \n&gt; One who has the nerve to think that one can compare the wisdo=\r\nm of \n&gt; Jnaneshwar, dispassion of Ramana Maharshi, mad devotion of Ramakris=\r\nhna \n&gt; Paramahamsa, detached activism of Vivekananda, compassion of Shirdi =\r\nSai, \n&gt; spiritual ecstasy of Vama Khepa, inner clarity of Lahiri Mahashaya,=\r\n \n&gt; detachment of Trilinga Swami, purity of Tukaram, humility of Eknath \n&gt; =\r\nMaharaj, ecstatic love of Meera Bai, motherly love of Gopaler Ma, etc, \n&gt; i=\r\ns a fool of the highest order. They can be compared from specific \n&gt; limite=\r\nd perspectives. In one thing, Tukaram may be superior to all, in \n&gt; another=\r\n Jnaneshwar, in another Trilinga, in another Ramakrishna, and so \n&gt; on. You=\r\n cannot compare in absolute terms. You should not even try to. \n&gt; You shoul=\r\nd just appreciate them individually and aspire to be like any \n&gt; of them th=\r\nat you like the most. \n&gt; \n&gt; Vimalananda&#39;s list may be correct from specific=\r\n perspective. More \n&gt; importantly, his words should make one realize that t=\r\nhere is always \n&gt; scope for further self-control (and the resulting mastery=\r\n over the field \n&gt; of duality) while one is still embodied. One should neve=\r\nr rest and \n&gt; aspire for better self-control. But taking it as gospel and s=\r\ntarting to \n&gt; judge yogis based on that is unwise. Especially making statem=\r\nents like \n&gt; &quot;Vimalananda is heavier than all RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot; and =\r\nthinking \n&gt; that something is absolute truth because Vimalananda is assumed=\r\n to have \n&gt; said that (vs someone &quot;lower than him&quot;) is unwise. \n&gt; \n&gt; Even i=\r\nf Vimalananda&#39;s hierarchy is absolute and universal, don&#39;t assume \n&gt; that y=\r\nou can judge the stature of each yogi accurately. Because \n&gt; Ramakrishna wa=\r\ns popularly known as a Paramahamsa, is he a Paramahamsa as \n&gt; per Vimalanan=\r\nda&#39;s classification or a siddha or a natha or even a rishi? \n&gt; Or may be a =\r\ndeity? My friend, don&#39;t assume you know for sure!!! Based on \n&gt; the details=\r\n we know, can we be absolutely sure of even Vimalananda&#39;s \n&gt; stature based =\r\non his own classification? \n&gt; \n&gt; You said &quot;Approximating 2 equal to each di=\r\nsciples of ramakrishna. 2exp16 \n&gt; =3D say Vimalananda. Basic?&quot; You probably=\r\n made this statement based on \n&gt; what you read and heard of Vimalananda. Fo=\r\nr the sake of argument, it is \n&gt; not even 100% clear whether he was a real =\r\nperson or an imagined \n&gt; character. Svoboda intentionally (and very wisely!=\r\n) left the latter \n&gt; option open in the preface of his Aghora book! \n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nf we MUST compare spiritual calibers, one possibility is to use a \n&gt; simple=\r\nr definition of how close one is to liberation as a measure of \n&gt; one&#39;s &quot;sp=\r\niritual caliber&quot;, Ramakrishna&#39;s disciples fare quite well. RK \n&gt; told Abhed=\r\nananda that it was going to be his last birth. Others would be \n&gt; back, but=\r\n he would be liberated. To Yogananda, he said there would be \n&gt; one more bi=\r\nrth and he would be free forever after that. Vimalananda, on \n&gt; the other h=\r\nand, had atleast one more birth clearly as he said a body was \n&gt; waiting fo=\r\nr him. That way, forget about &quot;RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot;, just \n&gt; Abhedanand=\r\na alone is superior to Vimalananda! \n&gt; \n&gt; Again, please note that this is j=\r\nust one definition. One can have many \n&gt; definitions. The key is not to jum=\r\np to unwise conclusions on any \n&gt; hierarchies and say that &quot;X is weightier =\r\nthan Y and so what he said must \n&gt; be more correct&quot;. \n&gt; \n&gt; People with lops=\r\nided understanding of scriptures take relative knowledge \n&gt; to be absolute =\r\nand jump to unwise conclusions. I am afraid some people \n&gt; are doing the sa=\r\nme now with &quot;modern scriptures&quot; such as the Aghora \n&gt; books. Don&#39;t fall int=\r\no the trap of taking something as gospel or as \n&gt; absolute. Written words a=\r\nre always relative and never absolute. \n&gt; Discriminate relative knowledge u=\r\nsing intellect at first and hopefully \n&gt; using experencial realization late=\r\nr on. \n&gt; \n&gt; More importantly, while we are still searching for &quot;maturity&quot;, =\r\nwe should \n&gt; not commit the &quot;error&quot; of making negative judgmental comments =\r\nof greats \n&gt; who did far more sadhana than us and experienced a lot more th=\r\nan us. \n&gt; ------------------------------- \n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards, \n&gt; Narasimha =\r\n\n \r\n--0-1782574124-1312259059=:15792\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ti=\r\nmes new roman, new york, times, serif;font-size:12pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font style=3D&quot;font-f=\r\namily: arial,helvetica,sans-serif;&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Namaste,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Talk on Swam=\r\ni Vivekananda&#39;s depth:&lt;br&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Drxunhd9495E&lt;/fon=\r\nt&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,=\r\nserif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman,new yor=\r\nk,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;hr size=\r\n=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Narasimha PVR=\r\n Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bo=\r\nld;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Tuesday, 2 August 2011, 7:20&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;fon=\r\nt-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Siddhis &amp; Sp=\r\niritual Progress&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1769623781&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;display: none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv1769623781ygrp-text&quot;=\r\n&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;V=\r\nerdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Namaste,&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;=\r\n#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&gt; However, in their=\r\n forms as specific individuals like Vivekananda, whether&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div a=\r\nlign=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&gt; thes=\r\ne amsa attain the specific stages which makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi&lt;/fon=\r\nt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&gt; will determine if they are to be called so. .. the only way a p=\r\nerson can be&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&gt; called a siddha in true sense is when he, as V=\r\nimalananda puts it, &quot;picks&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#=\r\n000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&gt; a petal&quot;, (some specific shaktis) =\r\nan &quot;orbit&quot; and moves closer to the&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div\n align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font c=\r\nolor=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&gt; Centre and yet not mergin=\r\ng into it, deeper and deeper.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=\r\n=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;L=\r\nEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;How do you know th=\r\nat Vivekananda, Yogananda etc did not do that (or possibly even more)?

BTW, Vimal=\r\nananda even goes to extent of mentioning a Nath may takes thousands of year=\r\ns of sadhana to pulled into a Muni and similarly a Muni may take &quot;billions&quot;=\r\n of years of sadhana to become a Rishi, IF, a higher being decides to pull =\r\nthem forward.

Can you =\r\ntell me where this falls on Vimalananda&#39;s scale? What do you think &quot;Nithya =\r\nSiddha&quot; (nithya=3Deternal) means? Is it Siddha or Mahasiddha or even greate=\r\nr or in between? If six disciples were &quot;Nithya Siddhas&quot; and Ramakrishna is =\r\n&quot;greater&quot; as you say, can he be a &quot;Paramahamsa&quot; on this scale, i.e. lower t=\r\nhan them?&gt;&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; =\r\nface=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font c=\r\nolor=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Simple! Ramakrishna says Vivek=\r\nananda was a part of a Rishi who came down. An amsa is not a Rishi in fullf=\r\norce, but sufficient part of the Rishi&#39;s consciousness that comes down for =\r\na secific\n purpose and once the purpose is served, goes back to the source.=\r\n Similar for the 6 Nitya-Siddhas. Therefore, very technically, Swami Viveka=\r\nnanda is an *amsa* of a Rishi, a projection of a Rishi. Not the Rishi is fu=\r\nll. BTW, all of these Siddhas, Naths, Munis etc are projection Rishis one w=\r\nay or the other. Each is kept is ingorance of their real being (Rishi) such=\r\n that the play can go on (not my words, Vimalananda&#39;s words). They are Nity=\r\na-siddha because even if they take birth over and over, being parts of extr=\r\nemely higher beings, these emanations/projections/amsas will surely eventua=\r\nlly go back to the source when the work is done. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D=\r\n&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;=\r\n&gt;However, in their forms as specific individuals like Vivekananda, whether =\r\nthese amsa attain the specific stages which makes a siddha/nath/muni/rishi =\r\nwill determine if\n they are to be called so. They may not need to do so sin=\r\nce they are here for a purpose. But, the only way a person can be called a =\r\nsiddha in true sense is when he, as Vimalananda puts it, &quot;picks a petal&quot;, (=\r\nsome specific shaktis) an &quot;orbit&quot; and moves closer to the Centre and yet no=\r\nt merging into it, deeper and deeper.&nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Ther=\r\ne is a book of conversations between Totapuri and a certain sadhaka (his di=\r\nsciple) when Totapuri lived in Puri. He used to stay in the Swargadwara sma=\r\nshana and later someone build a small ashram for him. Totapuri&#39;s ashram sti=\r\nll exists in Puri. In that conversation, Totapuri also mentions a similar i=\r\ndeas of what is a siddha and higher. And how only a Siddha and none less is=\r\n a true Vigyani. He further mentions that Swami Vivekananda did not (need) =\r\nto go to the stage of a\n Siddha. His work was specific, he did the work and=\r\n went off. He did not need to and therefore did not become a Siddha. I see =\r\nzero confusion here. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#00000=\r\n0&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;fon=\r\nt color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Added to this the fact that=\r\n Vivekananda was very clear, just as all the disciples of Ramakrshna were c=\r\nlear, that Ramakrishna was a special spiritual being, and higher than them.=\r\n Here too I see no confusion. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=\r\n=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/f=\r\nont&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=\r\n=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;&lt;It is not necessary that there is a clear order of greatness=\r\n.

Anyway, Vivekananda&#39;s own words are more reliable for me than yours on=\r\n this matter.

If six disciples were &quot;Nithya Siddhas&quot; and Ramakrishna is &quot;great=\r\ner&quot; as you say, can he be a &quot;Paramahamsa&quot; on this scale, i.e.\n lower than t=\r\nhem? &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEF=\r\nT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *=\r\n &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;V=\r\nerdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&nbsp; &lt;/i&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div align=3D&quot;LEFT&quot;&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Verdana&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;i&gt;&gt; Vivekananda sa=\r\nys Ramakrishna a greater spiritual man.

That is a crucial difference.&nbsp; My comparisons are always based NOT o=\r\nn my understanding, but clear words of great spiritual people. That is why =\r\nI am 100 perecent clear that Ramakrishna is spiritually higher than a Vivek=\r\nananada or an Abhedananda. You may not want to judge them., thats your poin=\r\nt of view. I on the other hand would rather rely on the clear words of Vive=\r\nkananda and Abhedananda on this matter rather than speculation.
