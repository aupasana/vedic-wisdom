Its central portion represents =\r\nthe\nsun of our universe. Electrons revolve around the nucleus (sun) just as=\r\n\nplanets revolve around the sun of our solar system. Just as infinite space=\r\n\nexist outside the periphery of the solar system so too there is a lot of\ns=\r\npace present in the atom. Between various solar systems of the cosmos there=\r\n\nexists ample and optimum space separating each of them. Similarly there ar=\r\ne\nvaried differences in the central region of all atoms. Although externall=\r\ny\nthey appear to be identical internally differences are noted. For example=\r\n,\nin Uranium there are 92 electrons whereas in Carbon there are only 6\nelec=\r\ntrons.\n\nEvery human being can be akin to an entire cosmos. His soul is like=\r\n the sun\nin whose vicinity atoms and planets revolve. Atoms, bacteria, viru=\r\nses etc\nthat are found in the human body are known to emit a special kind o=\r\nf\nelectricity. It is because of the influence of this electricity that orga=\r\nns\nlike the brain etc function aptly. It is that very medium through which\n=\r\nconsciousness can manifest in inert nature. Ordinarily movements of various=\r\n\ntypes are seen in atoms. They lack the capacity to think or experience\nany=\r\nthing. But human electricity called Prana (life/vital force)\nconsciousness =\r\nin inert group of atoms is known to manifest the capacity of\nthinking and t=\r\nhus life comes into existence.\n\nAround the Polar region of planet earth mag=\r\nnetic storms are known to erupt.\nThey emit unsteady light which is called A=\r\nurora Borealis. Polar region in\nturn attract radiations, light and other in=\r\nfluences from other planets to\nour globe. Further certain special influence=\r\ns of Earth are transported to\nother planets of the universe. Polar region o=\r\nf the earth is said to be the\npoint of contact with the rest of the cosmos.=\r\n Our earth=92s present existence\nis dependent on inter planetary radiations=\r\n which pass through the Polar\nregion. Apart from this, the present position=\r\ning of other planets are as\nthey are as a result of various incessant radia=\r\ntions active in the earth=92s\nPolar region. If at all due to some reason th=\r\nis relationship of give and\ntake comes to a grinding halt such a dire influ=\r\nence will manifest that life\non our globe will cease to sustain and exist. =\r\nTogether with this a change in\nthe hierarchy and positioning of planets wil=\r\nl lead to chaos in the present\nday activities of the solar system. A little=\r\n movement in a small area\ncontributes quite gigantically to the revolving a=\r\nctivity of the earth and\nother planets. The more we ponder over this fact t=\r\nhe more its mystery will\nunfold lucidly.\n\nMan=92s inner consciousness too i=\r\ns similarly a focused area of Divine Energy.\nWithin it there are infinite k=\r\nnown and unknown potentialities like desire\npower, emotional power, power o=\r\nf resolve, attraction power, repulsion power\netc. If these are activated op=\r\ntimally, if we can learn to make apt use of\nthem we can experience the mani=\r\nfestation of all cosmic powers. Man=92s\nconsciousness is infinite like the =\r\ngigantic space of the solar system.\nWhatever exists in it is more powerful =\r\nthan inter planetary space. Alas but\ndespite all this it is mind boggling t=\r\nhat we are totally unaware of this\ndivine treasure house indwelling in our =\r\ninner being. If some how or the\nother we are capable enough of establishing=\r\n a bond with the root source of\ninfinite energy which is akin to a gigantic=\r\n ocean an individual can become\nan infinite storehouse of Divine Energy. As=\r\n a result what previously seemed\nimpossible can now be made possible via th=\r\nis infinite ocean of energy. Sun\nor Savita is the personal god or icon of a=\r\nll human beings. The goal of all\nshould be to merge with this icon.\n\nHow is=\r\n this possible to attain? The answer is given by Solar Sciences.\n\nAuthor : =\r\nPt.
