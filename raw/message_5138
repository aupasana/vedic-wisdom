I would like to narrate my experience a=\r\nnd hopefully you can help me out regarding what happened.\n\n\nFor nearly 2 yr=\r\ns, I chanted Sr Rudram daily in the beginning, because I was not very fluen=\r\nt, I would pay attention to the pages I was reading. As months passed by, I=\r\n could chant without reading, I remembered it all in my head. What happened=\r\n as a result was that Rudram chanting no longer required any focus on my pa=\r\nrt, I could be doing anything while chanting this and as a result, my chant=\r\ning began to lose focus. While chanting, my eyes would be paying attention =\r\nto other things...the view outside the window, the clock, ghee left in the =\r\ndiya etc. My attention was everywhere else except on my chanting. I would t=\r\nry to chant with my eyes closed but because I was chanting aloud, doing tha=\r\nt was proving difficult...my eyes would keep opening and rover. I also noti=\r\nced that because I didn&#39;t understand what I was chanting, concentrating bec=\r\name even more difficult.\n\n\nToday, I am no longer doing that chanting. I sto=\r\npped doing that several months ago and Iam afraid that the skill I had mast=\r\nered in chanting is slowly getting lost....\n\n\nI repeated the same with Durg=\r\na suktam. While I was new at chanting, I would focus better on my chanting.=\r\n As I became fluent, I lost focus. In this case as well, I had no clue what=\r\n I was chanting.\n\n\nMy sadhana is more simple now, consisting of mental mant=\r\nra recitation but to me, it feels much more better doing that than chanting=\r\n something I do not understand.\n\n\nAfter reading your message, I am wonderin=\r\ng why the words of rishis, the Rudram or the Suktam did not translate into =\r\nenergy for me. Please do not misunderstand, I am not trying to question you=\r\n, I am just trying to find an answer to something that keeps troubling me.\n=\r\n\n\nThanks,\nBhupendra\n\n\n\nSent from my iPod\n\nOn Oct 25, 2010, at 5:23 PM, Nara=\r\nsimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0 \n\nNamaste friends,\n\nI wil=\r\nl give my 2 cents on a few points.\n\n* * *\n\nI once wanted to translate Devi =\r\nSaptashati into my mother tongue Telugu in poetic form, so that Telugu peop=\r\nle who find Saptashati too complicated to read or feel uncomfortable becaus=\r\ne they do not know the meaning, can read the Telugu version instead. When I=\r\n floated the idea, Manish discouraged me. He asked me, &quot;who do you think yo=\r\nu are?&quot; He said that it could be considered later, but firmly told me to dr=\r\nop the idea for then.\n\nPlease note that the goal of sadhana, such as homam,=\r\n meditation, chanting mantras and prayers, is NOT just an intellectual unde=\r\nrstanding of what they mean. They are tools to silence the mind and channel=\r\n its energy. They are storehouses of some shakti left by rishis, yogis and =\r\nsadhakas, who used them in the past.\n\nAn intellectual understanding may hel=\r\np facilitate the right mood, right frame of mind and right imagery. But, ev=\r\nen without it, a mantra that was used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis h=\r\nolds power.\n\nIn fact, the words of a rishi that one cannot intellectually u=\r\nnderstand can be more effective for spiritual progress, than the words of a=\r\n normal person that one can intellectually understand and appreciate. So, I=\r\n suggest not worrying about whether one understands or not and reading Sans=\r\nkrit mantras coming from great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.\n\n* * *\n\nIf I were to =\r\ngive an analogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman may read a lot of sc=\r\nholarly analysis on how to play shots, how to see the ball from the hand of=\r\n the bowler, how to move feet, how get into the line of the ball, how to pl=\r\nay it with a straight bat, when to play front foot and when to play back fo=\r\not etc. But that does not necessarily make one a good batsman. If one pract=\r\nices, THAT can make one a good player. Of course, some basic understanding =\r\nof principles is needed. But, above that, practice is more important than b=\r\nookish knowledge.\n\nSimilarly, some conceptual understanding is important in=\r\n spirituality also, but above that, sadhana is more important.\n\nThe essence=\r\n of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all paths is very simple. It=\r\n is that we should overcome the notions that we are doing things and realiz=\r\ne that the divine acts through all of us. The divine acts through each bein=\r\ng based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives corresponding reactions. One goes t=\r\nhrough the cycle until one overcomes the notions of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is =\r\nmine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike that&quot; etc. Though this is the essence of =\r\nall scriptures and one knows it, one may be deluded again and again. There =\r\nis no magic formula to internalize this understanding fully and overcome th=\r\ne instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.\n\nSo, even if one practices=\r\n a mantra that one does not intellectually understand, that is ok. As long =\r\nas the basic essence of scriptures is at the back of one&#39;s mind, one is con=\r\nstantly contemplating and watching over one&#39;s own thoughts and instincts, t=\r\no root out undesirable thoughts, one&#39;s sadhana will yield results.\n\n* * *\n\n=\r\nThis is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is fine to read script=\r\nures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual people (physically or vi=\r\nrtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that will only create a th=\r\neoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and to govern all of one=\r\n&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sadhana.\n\nOne doing sad=\r\nhana without a basic theoretical understanding of what is what and what we =\r\nwant, is like a blind person running around a mountain, instead of climbing=\r\n it. One not doing sadhana, but having an excellent theoretical understanfi=\r\nng, is like a person who knows that he needs to climb the mountain, but kee=\r\nps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it.\n\n* * *\n\nRegarding the st=\r\natement that initiation is important in tantric path but not in Vedic path,=\r\n I want to add my 2 cents.\n\nWhether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distin=\r\nct* paths or parts of a continuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccura=\r\nte notions today.\n\nThe issue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is o=\r\nne&#39;s attitude and what one wants. Anybody who wants specific material resul=\r\nts needs to be careful regarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karm=\r\nas to affect a particular result is not easy. It requires supervision of a =\r\ngood guru and not many are left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT lo=\r\noking for specific material results and is looking for spiritual progress, =\r\nthe constraints are fewer and options more.\n\nSome may sub-consciously have =\r\na notion that Tantrik path is for begetting specific material results and V=\r\nedic path is for self-realization. That is incorrect. After all, one in the=\r\n Vedic path may chant Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or Ayushya so=\r\noktam for longevity, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat =\r\na gross substance in an elaborate ritual to reinforce the notion that &quot;all =\r\nis Brahman&quot; and to remove the mental repulsion towards some objects.\n\n* * *=\r\n\n\nMy thumbrule is this. If you are looking for a specific material result, =\r\nyou need clear guidance and supervision, which not many are capable of givi=\r\nng today! Instead, if you want spiritual progress and an increase of your s=\r\nurrender, you can just keep doing sadhana without initiation or guidance. J=\r\nust keep company of scriptures and other like-minded people.\n\nAfter all, if=\r\n you want to go to Calcutta, you need clear and precise directions and some=\r\n supervision. If you just want to go to north pole, you can keep walking to=\r\nwards north. Of course, having supervision helps there too, but you can do =\r\nwithout it!\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish W=\r\nritings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:=\r\n\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nFilms that make a difference: http://Sarasw=\r\natiFilms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n-----=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\n---- vedic_pathak &lt;v=\r\nedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Satya Prakash Ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; The reaso=\r\nn I advised the non-initiate to read in English or any &gt;other regional lang=\r\nuage is because understanding the meaning and &gt;constant reflection are poss=\r\nible only when one repeatedly reads the &gt;text in a language that they can f=\r\nully follow.\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes Sir, if this is the reason then its understandable.

Since the last 4-5 years I have prefe=\r\nrred to stay away from internet forums due to various reasons. It has been =\r\nnearly a year since I interacted on an internet forum. However after Narasi=\r\nmha garu forwarded a copy of the original post with my write up to my inbox=\r\n, I visited this forum and quickly browsed through some posts. I am happy t=\r\no note that the general atmosphere here is far better and more sincere than=\r\n a lot of other forums. Having quickly browsed through this particular thre=\r\nad, I thought that I might reply to Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Utpal=\r\n ji has raised an important question regarding the necessity of initiation.=\r\n I will address it after summarizing the big picture that needs to be invok=\r\ned in order to understand the ONE question and the MANY answers possible. F=\r\nirstly is the question a general or specific one? Generally speaking if the=\r\n question is whether initiation is an absolute requirement for spiritual li=\r\nfe or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if the question is about the nec=\r\nessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*,=\r\n the answer is =C3=82?YES.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the t=\r\nantric adage goes; thereby the necessity for multiple approaches and multip=\r\nle paths. Thus arises the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In the pa=\r\nn-Indian context there are many paths for sadhana. But in the current conte=\r\nxt of this question I will restrict myself to only the five that are releva=\r\nnt to the discussion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; d. =\r\nBhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/=\r\nor Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practic=\r\nalisation of the great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above pat=\r\nhs EMPHASISES particular methods and techniques in its attempt to practical=\r\nise the abstract truths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at th=\r\ne predominant methods/ techniques employed by each of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fo=\r\nr those who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking =\r\neven the external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit fro=\r\nm the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advait=\r\na emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflecti=\r\non). Advaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it has re=\r\ntained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too=\r\n as an important practice. All of these practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a b=\r\nig way with a marginal role for external practices.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yoga marga=\r\n emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vairagya (No=\r\nn-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally emphasi=\r\nse &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara) too wh=\r\nile Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first two as t=\r\nhey subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) =\r\nemphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s will through total surrende=\r\nr to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Karma marga is on Action =\r\nas advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions without attachment t=\r\no the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Fina=\r\nlly I will address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where alone the inevi=\r\ntable necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. M=\r\nantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain occult truths via th=\r\ne energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It presupposes certain=\r\n dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby certain regulations and=\r\n safe practices. It should be remembered that except Bhakti marga most path=\r\ns invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes=\r\n Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the pat=\r\nhs that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, an=\r\nother the fire of speech, another the fire of austerity, and yet another th=\r\ne physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of in=\r\nvoking fire deals with the fire of Vak through the lab-like practical mantr=\r\nasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniques that bring results=\r\n more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about aut=\r\nhority but more about qualification. Would you allow a child to experiment =\r\nwith fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor need experience and =\r\ntraining or not? Like any other lab experiment proper training and experien=\r\nce are part of the procedure apart from certain safety measures, in the Tan=\r\ntric lab experiment too. However the lab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst =\r\nthe experiment is awakening the Sakti within the individual consciousness (=\r\nalso referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intel=\r\nlectualisation, I will refrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. Wi=\r\nthout going into other needless details here, I will just elaborate on init=\r\niation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri =\r\nChandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Tantric context too. =\r\nSakti sadhana is one major river within the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha=\r\n Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. However there are =\r\nactually three major schools that are full-fledged living traditions among =\r\nthe DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana=\r\n belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to m=\r\nake the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have t=\r\naken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will dr=\r\naw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both th=\r\ne Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not=\r\n invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the=\r\n major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bi=\r\nja, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of synchronistic f=\r\nrequencies for each of these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fledged=\r\n entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path=\r\n (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA h=\r\nimself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-branche=\r\ns and twigs spread out progressively downward till the individual sadhaka. =\r\nIt is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern metaphor=\r\n that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric advocat=\r\ne that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the conduit =\r\nof electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful\n bul=\r\nbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where there is=\r\n a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up till S=\r\niva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). No=\r\nw back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seek=\r\ns to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness through an integrated=\r\n approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Man=\r\ntra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and i=\r\nntegrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri =\r\nSri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also =\r\na full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also simul=\r\ntaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of ini=\r\ntiation is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus employ=\r\ning the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a yog=\r\nasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extensi=\r\nvely in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic pat=\r\nh, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections t=\r\nhrough its central message\n of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning glory=\r\n in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-fl=\r\nedged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying &quot;I alone=\r\n exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it =\r\nwith the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central trut=\r\nh of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in=\r\n English or any other regional language is because understanding the meanin=\r\ng and constant reflection are possible only when one repeatedly reads the t=\r\next in a language that they can fully follow. The main idea of the writeup =\r\nis to explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart from its obv=\r\nious status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equally regarded=\r\n as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In that rega=\r\nrd all the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are equally pos=\r\nsible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone =\r\nwho is acquainted with the original Vedic method will straightaway identify=\r\n that Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the worship of the=\r\n Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a one on on=\r\ne mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Just as=\r\n some practitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadh=\r\nana in accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to th=\r\ne Tantric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this p=\r\narticular approach that needs initiation as per its own principles. Initiat=\r\nion is not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara,=\r\n or the Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach o=\r\nf reading the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not requi=\r\nred if one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Y=\r\nagnya. One may benefit from any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chand=\r\ni. However one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditions=\r\n of both Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various par=\r\nts of the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and henc=\r\ne the importance of initiation for those paths, be it\n Sri Sri Chandi or Sr=\r\ni Vidya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through a=\r\nny of the merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vicha=\r\nra, Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa =\r\netc are all effective. However depending on the individual temperament, apt=\r\nitude etc., some of these methods are more suited relatively to different p=\r\nractitioners. One may progress through a combination of any of these method=\r\ns in spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALI=\r\nKULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the a=\r\nnswer to the question has to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally one la=\r\nst word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are t=\r\nhe most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of=\r\n texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. This is=\r\n best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATSANGH=\r\nA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alter=\r\nnate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is=\r\n Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress in s=\r\npiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of=\r\n serving, listening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and sants=\r\n in his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a quantum=\r\n leap in their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakri=\r\nshna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; For those =\r\nwho complain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote Sw=\r\nami Sivananda:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowaday=\r\ns that there are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sa=\r\ndhus is a question of supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the =\r\nsupply will come at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are =\r\nreally thirsty, you will find your Master at your threshold. You lead a hap=\r\npy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do n=\r\not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping=\r\n and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, gree=\r\nd, and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;..=\r\n. Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall take y=\r\nou to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will put you in the right path, g=\r\nuide you and elevate you to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high soul=\r\ns are waiting to get hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in p=\r\nlenty.\n Real seekers are few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good Mah=\r\natmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers af=\r\nter Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this forum is=\r\n an opportunity for Satsangha. Conducted with the appropriate bhavana, this=\r\n group too is a potential Satsangha though not comparable to the actual com=\r\npany of the great masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Chandi as a yoga-vedanti=\r\nc text alongside a study of the lives of great Saktas such as Sri Ramakrish=\r\nna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or singing the uplifting kirtans/chants la=\r\nuding the Mother, by constant remembrance and reflection, by discernment of=\r\n sat and asat, by genuine and sincere discussions on a group such as this, =\r\none makes progress truly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I may not interact regularly or repl=\r\ny at least for a while. However I might participate in some discussions on =\r\nand off.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Satya Prakash\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I read this message of respected Na=\r\nrasimha Garu few times.

Because of this ritual, god may give any =\r\nmaterial results or spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my desires=\r\n. I will accept whatever god gives. I want to increase my devotion and surr=\r\nender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is not re=\r\nquired.

Similarly, a g=\r\nuru with some achievement in a mantra can transfer some of it to a disciple=\r\n. However, one without a rich father is still better off opening a bank acc=\r\nount with a zero balance and building it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard work=\r\n. Similarly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous mantra=\r\ns and build one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate you=\r\n (not as a formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, ju=\r\nst go ahead and do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals are use=\r\nd for two purposes - (i) for getting specific material results and (ii) as =\r\ntools of increasing surrender and making spiritual progress. In the case of=\r\n (ii), initiation is not that important. But, in the case of (i), there are=\r\n pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently. One can get in trouble o=\r\ntherwise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, there are v=\r\nery few people who can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabilized the whole=\r\n system, for a reason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and ritu=\r\nals only for increasing surrender, getting whatever material results god wa=\r\nnts to give and making spiritual progress. If one is meant to do rituals fo=\r\nr begetting *specific* material results (for oneself or others or society/u=\r\nniverse in general), Nature will make arrangements for one to get correct k=\r\nnowledge of such rituals. But, as one starts, one should start with the att=\r\nitude of (ii).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any =\r\nmantra or any ritual or any homam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have sever=\r\nal material desires, but I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of this =\r\nritual, god may give any material results or spiritual results and not nece=\r\nssarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives. I want to incr=\r\nease my devotion and surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then S=\r\nAFE. Initiation is not required. That attitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but there are=\r\n fewer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast, but there may be some hic=\r\ncups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rot=\r\nten fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to r=\r\netrieve one good fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, one may do=\r\n it gently and the spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. =\r\nIf the person is aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be more spill=\r\nage of rotten fruits on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotte=\r\nn fruits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a =\r\nbasket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage an=\r\nd give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity =\r\nlike Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good fr=\r\nuit, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or\n Bhair=\r\nava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes o=\r\nut faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the end, remember that these fruits are n=\r\not deity&#39;s creations, but fruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you =\r\nwould&#39;ve had to eat each of those rotten fruits before eating the good frui=\r\nts!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to take some of the spilla=\r\nge of rotten fruits is better off avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi an=\r\nd staying with gentler deities. If initiation if made mandatory, one can be=\r\n assessed by a guru before starting a practice. If you realize the above, y=\r\nou can start mantras without initiation. If some bad results occut, you hav=\r\ne to realize that it is a fruit of your own actions and the deity is trying=\r\n to accelerate good results. If you are weak-hearted, stick to gentler deit=\r\nies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp in their life=\r\n and were ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam now. Some people who t=\r\nook several hours to read Saptashati for the first time just 2-3 years back=\r\n are now doing Chandi homam with entire saptashati everyday. I know that so=\r\nme of them have transformed a lot and have experienced some things too. Obv=\r\niously, they have done sadhana with fire and sadhana of the Fierce aspects =\r\nof Divine Mother in some past lives.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of=\r\n ignorance and rank materialism, if someone has even a faint idea that spir=\r\nitual progress is important, is looking for god and is attracted to a speci=\r\nfic advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath), that person obviously has some good=\r\n karmas and good vasanas. That person has done that sadhana in the past. Pr=\r\nevious life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s adhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If =\r\nyou have a good understanding of what is what, how things work, why one sho=\r\nuld do something, how to do it, what is more important and what is less imp=\r\nortant, that is what initiation is all about!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best rega=\r\nrds\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1554147822-1288061289=:15062\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Respected Bhupendraji&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Pr=\r\nanams&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I advise you to buy this book of Gita press where full tra=\r\nnslation of Rudrashtadhyayi has been given.I just love chapter no.7 where w=\r\ne&nbsp;surrender our body to God.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt; &lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;P st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;LINE-HEIGHT: 170%&quot; align=3Djustify&gt;Code : 1627&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B&gt;Title : &lt;/B&gt;&lt;B&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12px&quot; color=3Dred&gt;Rudrastadhyayee,Price is just R=\r\ns.20/ -!!

As months passed by, I could chant without reading, I remembered it=\r\n all in my head. What happened as a result was that Rudram chanting no long=\r\ner required any focus on my part, I could be doing anything while chanting =\r\nthis and as a result, my chanting began to lose focus. While chanting, my e=\r\nyes would be paying attention to other things...the view outside the window=\r\n, the clock, ghee left in the diya etc. My attention was everywhere else ex=\r\ncept on my chanting. I would try to chant with my eyes closed but because I=\r\n was chanting aloud, doing that was proving difficult...my eyes would keep =\r\nopening and rover.

When I floated the idea, Manish discouraged me. H=\r\ne asked me, &quot;who do you think you are?&quot; He said that it could be considered=\r\n later, but firmly told me to drop the idea for then.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please note th=\r\nat the goal of sadhana, such as homam, meditation, chanting mantras and pra=\r\nyers, is NOT just an intellectual understanding of what they mean. They are=\r\n tools to silence the mind and channel its energy. They are storehouses of =\r\nsome shakti left by rishis, yogis and sadhakas, who used them in the past.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;An intellectual understanding may help facilitate the right mood, ri=\r\nght frame of mind and right imagery. But, even without\n it, a mantra that w=\r\nas used by great sadhakas, yogis and rishis holds power.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In fact, th=\r\ne words of a rishi that one cannot intellectually understand can be more ef=\r\nfective for spiritual progress, than the words of a normal person that one =\r\ncan intellectually understand and appreciate. So, I suggest not worrying ab=\r\nout whether one understands or not and reading Sanskrit mantras coming from=\r\n great rishis/yogis/sadhakas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If I were to give an anal=\r\nogy in terms of playing cricket, a batsman may read a lot of scholarly anal=\r\nysis on how to play shots, how to see the ball from the hand of the bowler,=\r\n how to move feet, how get into the line of the ball, how to play it with a=\r\n straight bat, when to play front foot and when to play back foot etc. But =\r\nthat does not necessarily make one a good batsman. If one practices, THAT c=\r\nan make one a good player. Of course, some basic understanding of principle=\r\ns is needed. But, above that, practice is more\n important than bookish know=\r\nledge.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Similarly, some conceptual understanding is important in spir=\r\nituality also, but above that, sadhana is more important.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The essenc=\r\ne of all scriptures, all mantras, all sadhanas, all paths is very simple. I=\r\nt is that we should overcome the notions that we are doing things and reali=\r\nze that the divine acts through all of us. The divine acts through each bei=\r\nng based on one&#39;s conditioning and gives corresponding reactions. One goes =\r\nthrough the cycle until one overcomes the notions of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is=\r\n mine&quot;, &quot;I like this and I dislike that&quot; etc. Though this is the essence of=\r\n all scriptures and one knows it, one may be deluded again and again. There=\r\n is no magic formula to internalize this understanding fully and overcome t=\r\nhe instincts of &quot;I am doing&quot;, &quot;this is mine&quot; etc.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So, even if one pr=\r\nactices a mantra that one does not intellectually understand, that is ok. A=\r\ns long as the basic essence of\n scriptures is at the back of one&#39;s mind, on=\r\ne is constantly contemplating and watching over one&#39;s own thoughts and inst=\r\nincts, to root out undesirable thoughts, one&#39;s sadhana will yield results.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This is why I keep repeating the need of sadhana. It is=\r\n fine to read scriptures and other books. It is fine to meet spiritual peop=\r\nle (physically or virtually, like here) and discuss good things. But that w=\r\nill only create a theoretical understanding. For it to be internalized and =\r\nto govern all of one&#39;s instincts, thoughts and actions, one needs to do sad=\r\nhana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One doing sadhana without a basic theoretical understanding of=\r\n what is what and what we want, is like a blind person running around a mou=\r\nntain, instead of climbing it. One not doing sadhana, but having an excelle=\r\nnt theoretical understanfing, is like a person who knows that he needs to c=\r\nlimb the mountain, but keeps staring at the pinnacle instead of climbing it=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* *\n *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regarding the statement that initiation is important=\r\n in tantric path but not in Vedic path, I want to add my 2 cents.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Wh=\r\nether Vedic and tantrik paths are two *distinct* paths or parts of a contin=\r\nuum is debatable. There are a lot of inaccurate notions today.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The i=\r\nssue is not really Tantrik vs Vedic. The issue is one&#39;s attitude and what o=\r\nne wants. Anybody who wants specific material results needs to be careful r=\r\negarding how to go about it. Re-arrangement of karmas to affect a particula=\r\nr result is not easy. It requires supervision of a good guru and not many a=\r\nre left anyway. On the other hand, if one is NOT looking for specific mater=\r\nial results and is looking for spiritual progress, the constraints are fewe=\r\nr and options more.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some may sub-consciously have a notion that Tant=\r\nrik path is for begetting specific material results and Vedic path is for s=\r\nelf-realization. That is incorrect. After all, one in the Vedic path may ch=\r\nant\n Manyu sooktam for victory in litigation or Ayushya sooktam for longevi=\r\nty, and so on. Similarly, one in the Tantrik path may eat a gross substance=\r\n in an elaborate ritual to reinforce the notion that &quot;all is Brahman&quot; and t=\r\no remove the mental repulsion towards some objects.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;My =\r\nthumbrule is this. If you are looking for a specific material result, you n=\r\need clear guidance and supervision, which not many are capable of giving to=\r\nday! Instead, if you want spiritual progress and an increase of your surren=\r\nder, you can just keep doing sadhana without initiation or guidance. Just k=\r\neep company of scriptures and other like-minded people.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;After all, i=\r\nf you want to go to Calcutta, you need clear and precise directions and som=\r\ne supervision. If you just want to go to north pole, you can keep walking t=\r\nowards north. Of course, having supervision helps there too, but you can do=\r\n without it!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best\n regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------------------=\r\n----------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish L=\r\nessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homa=\r\nm and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow target=3D_blank&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dn=\r\nofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films tha=\r\nt make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow =\r\ntarget=3D_blank&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow targe=\r\nt=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;ht=\r\ntp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;&lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=\r\n=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;-----------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;---- vedic_pathak &l=\r\nt;&lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic_pathak%4=\r\n0yahoo.com&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic_pathak%4=\r\n0yahoo.com&quot;&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic=\r\n_pathak@...&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic_p=\r\nathak@...&quot;&gt;vedic_pathak@...&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste=\r\n Satya Prakash Ji,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initi=\r\nate to read in English or any &gt;other regional language is because unders=\r\ntanding the meaning and &gt;constant reflection are possible only when one =\r\nrepeatedly reads the &gt;text in a language that they can fully follow.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yes Sir, if this is the reason then its understandable.

Since the last 4-5 years I have preferred to stay awa=\r\ny from internet forums due to various reasons. It has been nearly a year si=\r\nnce I interacted on an internet forum. However after Narasimha garu forward=\r\ned a copy of the original post with my write up to my inbox, I visited this=\r\n forum and quickly browsed through some posts. I am happy to note that the =\r\ngeneral atmosphere here is far better and more sincere than a lot of other =\r\nforums. Having quickly browsed through this particular thread, I thought th=\r\nat I might reply to Utpal ji&#39;s question.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Utpal ji has raised an important question regarding the necessity of ini=\r\ntiation. I will address it after summarizing the big picture that needs to =\r\nbe invoked in order to understand\n the ONE question and the MANY answers po=\r\nssible. Firstly is the question a general or specific one? Generally speaki=\r\nng if the question is whether initiation is an absolute requirement for spi=\r\nritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. However if the question is abou=\r\nt the necessity of being initiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantr=\r\na marga*, the answer is =C3=82?YES.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;M=\r\nunde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity f=\r\nor multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of=\r\n multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there are many paths for =\r\nsadhana. But in the current context of this question I will restrict myself=\r\n to only the five that are relevant to the discussion.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga (Advaitic/Vedantic)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; b. Yo=\r\nga marga (Psycho-spiritual)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; c. Mantra marga (Tantric)&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga\n (Love/Devotion)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; e. Karma =\r\nmarga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of the gre=\r\nat abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES partic=\r\nular methods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstract tru=\r\nths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant method=\r\ns/ techniques employed by each of these paths.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; For those =\r\nwho are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even the=\r\n external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from the wi=\r\nsdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita emphas=\r\nises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Adv=\r\naita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it has retained t=\r\nhe vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too as an i=\r\nmportant practice. All\n of these practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way =\r\nwith a marginal role for external practices.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice)=\r\n and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga add=\r\nitionally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the Supre=\r\nme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only t=\r\nhe first two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptanc=\r\ne of Iswara&#39;s will through total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary =\r\nthe emphasis in Karma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita.=\r\n Engaging in actions without attachment to the results is the mainstay of K=\r\narma marga of the Gita.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally I will=\r\n address the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable nece=\r\nssity of\n initiation and thereby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sad=\r\nhana involves the practicalization of certain occult truths via the energet=\r\nics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers =\r\ninherent to any lab experiment and thereby certain regulations and safe pra=\r\nctices. It should be remembered that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke =\r\nFire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (th=\r\ne reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that i=\r\nnvoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire of the intellect, another the=\r\n fire of speech, another the fire of austerity, and yet another the physica=\r\nl fire of the Yagnya and so on.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Tantra=\r\n&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak through the lab-like =\r\npractical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniques tha=\r\nt bring results more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara i=\r\ns\n not about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a chil=\r\nd to experiment with fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor need=\r\n experience and training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper train=\r\ning and experience are part of the procedure apart from certain safety meas=\r\nures, in the Tantric lab experiment too. However the lab is one&#39;s own consc=\r\niousness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the individual=\r\n consciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a topi=\r\nc for mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from further discussion on t=\r\nhe Kundalini. Without going into other needless details here, I will just e=\r\nlaborate on initiation and Guru parampara.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it=\r\n within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sadhana is one major river wi=\r\nthin the Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta\n sad=\r\nhanas comprehensively. However there are actually three major schools that =\r\nare full-fledged living traditions among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Sri=\r\nkula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vi=\r\ndya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the picture more complete the =\r\nVajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are=\r\n familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw attention to the the 21 forms o=\r\nf Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advaitic outlook as well as the =\r\nSakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is not invoked a=\r\nt all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at the major mil=\r\nestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra, bija, devata=\r\n, etc are all consistently of a particular set of synchronistic frequencies=\r\n for each of these three lineages. Initiation is the\n full-fledged entry of=\r\n the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that path (kula). =\r\nThe Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with SIVA himself at=\r\n the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-branches and twi=\r\ngs spread out progressively downward till the individual sadhaka. It is a b=\r\neautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern metaphor that one=\r\n can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric advocate that in=\r\nitiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the conduit of electr=\r\nicity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful bulbs/lights =\r\nat each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where there is a long se=\r\nries of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up till Siva himsel=\r\nf. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda). Now back to =\r\nSri Sri Chandi.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; As already stated Sakt=\r\na sadhana seeks to awaken Sakti within the\n individual consciousness throug=\r\nh an integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhav=\r\na, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly comp=\r\nrehensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the many i=\r\nn the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. Howe=\r\nver it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. I=\r\nt is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The =\r\nquestion of initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga =\r\nand thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore th=\r\ne text as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have =\r\ncovered extensively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to t=\r\nhe Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerfu=\r\nl reflections through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, the =\r\ncrowning glory in the text is the\n Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself procl=\r\naims in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, =\r\nsaying &quot;I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.=\r\n5). Compare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on t=\r\nhe central truth of Advaita.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; The reaso=\r\nn I advised the non-initiate to read in English or any other regional langu=\r\nage is because understanding the meaning and constant reflection are possib=\r\nle only when one repeatedly reads the text in a language that they can full=\r\ny follow. The main idea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaiti=\r\nc and Yogic text too apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However =\r\nSri Sri Chandi is also equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, =\r\nespecially the four hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mant=\r\nras or the Veda Samhita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence =\r\nthe practice of Chandi\n *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original=\r\n Vedic method will straightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic p=\r\nractice. In fact even the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is ful=\r\nly based on and DERIVED from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala wit=\r\nh the Hindu temple.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Just as some pract=\r\nitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in acco=\r\nrdance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the Tantric a=\r\npproach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this particular a=\r\npproach that needs initiation as per its own principles. Initiation is not =\r\nmandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yog=\r\nic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading t=\r\nhe text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one =\r\nis not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One =\r\nmay benefit from\n any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However=\r\n one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditions of both K=\r\nalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various parts of the =\r\nsubcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the impo=\r\nrtance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progr=\r\ness through any of the merthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, =\r\nViveka, Vichara, Iswarapranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi=\r\n bhava, Homa etc are all effective. However depending on the individual tem=\r\nperament, aptitude etc., some of these methods are more suited relatively t=\r\no different practitioners. One may progress through a combination of any of=\r\n these methods in spiritual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated app=\r\nroach of KALIKULA involves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture agains=\r\nt which\n the answer to the question has to be contextualised.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irrespective of the method a=\r\nnd path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effective methods for all of =\r\nus. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts followed by reflection on the =\r\ntruths expounded in the texts. This is best done in a language that one is =\r\nfully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice amo=\r\nng all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate method (though not as powerful) =\r\nwhere Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsangha and satsangha alone that e=\r\nnables one to make rapid progress in spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attain=\r\ned the rare exalted state by virtue of serving, listening to and spending t=\r\nime in the company of sadhus and sants in his younger days. Vivekananda , J=\r\nnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a quantum leap in their spiritual lives after =\r\nthey attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath=\r\n\n respectively.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; For those who complain=\r\n about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote Swami Sivanand=\r\na:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowaday=\r\ns that there are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sa=\r\ndhus is a question of supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the =\r\nsupply will come at once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are =\r\nreally thirsty, you will find your Master at your threshold. You lead a hap=\r\npy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do n=\r\not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping=\r\n and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, gree=\r\nd, and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;..=\r\n. Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall take y=\r\nou to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will put you in the right\n path, =\r\nguide you and elevate you to sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high sou=\r\nls are waiting to get hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in =\r\nplenty. Real seekers are few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good Mah=\r\natmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers af=\r\nter Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; To a certain e=\r\nxtent even this forum is an opportunity for Satsangha. Conducted with the a=\r\nppropriate bhavana, this group too is a potential Satsangha though not comp=\r\narable to the actual company of the great masters. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri =\r\nChandi as a yoga-vedantic text alongside a study of the lives of great Sakt=\r\nas such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or singing the upl=\r\nifting kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, by constant remembrance and refle=\r\nction, by discernment of sat and asat, by genuine and sincere discussions o=\r\nn a group such as this, one makes progress truly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; I may not interact regularly or reply at least for a while.
