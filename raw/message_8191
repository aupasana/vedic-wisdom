Chinese Chop-stick is a very good option here. I myself us=\r\ne it and find very comfortable. Let her manage the fire herself but you can=\r\n sit beside and intervene only if its needed.\n\nI think you need not worry a=\r\nbout Brahmacharya. I am sure many of us are not able to maintain absolute b=\r\nrahmacharya. let her start doing homam with some regularity without having =\r\naccess baggage of &quot;Brahmacharya&quot; or such Dogmas at this tender age. Leave e=\r\nverything related to homam in the hand of Jagadamba.\n\nbest wishes!\n\nUtpal \n=\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;prm7782&quot; &lt;prm7782@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Na=\r\nmaskaram PVR garu and members,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am interested in having my 1=\r\n1 yr old kid do homams independently, but the basic question arises how can=\r\n I help her in regulating the fire. \n&gt;     I know I am not supposed to put =\r\nanything inside the kunda. Since she has no experience she will need help s=\r\no I was wondering can I take a metallic spoon or something to help the fire=\r\n from going out? Any tips how can I help?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Another question that ari=\r\nses in my mind is, is it too early for me to teach homam.  Homam requires o=\r\nne to be brahmachari. Due to hormonal issues teens start experiencing sexua=\r\nl thoughts and varied emotions. Having a kid control her emotions at such a=\r\nn early age is it really right on my part? Will I be putting pressure on th=\r\nem .....shouldn&#39;t they experience the life in fullest form before endeavour=\r\ning the path of spirituality.  \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Experienced parents kindly advice m=\r\ne? \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Advance thanks for every help,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Priya\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
