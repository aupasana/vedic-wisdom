I ha=\r\nve some questions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Do you break your fast in the evening and have d=\r\ninner? or do you fast the whole day and night and have breakfast the next d=\r\nay (dvadasi)?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. If you have dinner at night, is it only sweet potato =\r\nor normal dinner with rice?\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; Ram\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _________________=\r\n_______________\n&gt;  From: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &quot;vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \n&gt; Sent: Thursday, Dec=\r\nember 8, 2011 7:43 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] My Eakadasi Vrat\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0 \n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; =C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I&#39;ve been unable to write because =\r\nI am caring for someone and so lots of tension.\n&gt; But as Eakadasi cycle jus=\r\nt started nearly 17 days ago, I=C2=A0will try=C2=A0to write my experience.\n=\r\n&gt; I do Eakadasi vrat every 15 days.\n&gt; =C2=A0I do this vrat for spiritual up=\r\nliftment and not to give my \n&gt; system any detox. My focus is on spiritual g=\r\nrowth.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I have a personal temple or altar in my home where e,very=\r\n thing that is cooked in our kitchen\n&gt; is offered with devotion and also co=\r\noked food that comes from outside. I remember once I was \n&gt; talking to Utpa=\r\nl on yahoo and I said I have just made tea and I am offering to Deities. I =\r\nthought\n&gt; he was a bit surprised that I am offering tea.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Anyway,=\r\n everyday food is very normal indian sattvic=C2=A0vegetarian food.but on Ea=\r\nkadasi day only\n&gt; potato or sweet potato=C2=A0cooked in ghee or butter=C2=\r\n=A0 are offered and fruits and then I take that as \n&gt; prasad. I keep all po=\r\nts and spoons etc used in cooking away from other=C2=A0utensils. I also tak=\r\ne tea \n&gt; and aspirin during the day=C2=A0but avoid taking several other vit=\r\namins etc.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I am doing this vrat for=C2=A0many years and few time=\r\ns tried to stop it but received spiritual nudges that I \n&gt; should keep it o=\r\nn. Then=C2=A0some years back,=C2=A0a relation sent us a booklet about Eakad=\r\nasi vrat from america, I said to my=C2=A0mother why\n&gt; she has sent this boo=\r\nk to us. My mother said that her mother-in- law has given=C2=A0this book to=\r\n her and she \n&gt; wants us to read it. As I was looking through it I saw that=\r\n on Eakadasi day, one should not drink water from a conch. I knew immediate=\r\nly it has come for me because everyday in the morning I drink water from a =\r\nconch after saying prayers.\n&gt; It gave such a feeling of joy that Eakadasi D=\r\neviji was watching me.\n&gt; LN\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
