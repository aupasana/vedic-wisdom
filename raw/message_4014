Author has res=\r\nearched the case pretty\n&gt; well and knew him personally, an interesting read=\r\n. It&#39;s pretty lengthy, if\n&gt; you are reading it make sure u have enough time=\r\n :)\n&gt; \n&gt; http://medhajournal.com/geopolitics-guru/973-why-swami-nithyananda=\r\n-must-resign-now.html?showall=3D1\n&gt; \n&gt; *Why Swami Nithyananda Must Resign N=\r\now\n&gt; Wednesday, 17 March 2010 18:40 Rajiv Malhotra*\n&gt; \n&gt; When the sex scand=\r\nal of Swami Nithyananda suddenly erupted on March 2, 2010,\n&gt; I was already =\r\nin Delhi as part of a group to go to Kumbh Mela. I was also\n&gt; finalizing my=\r\n new book which deals specifically with Tamil Nadu religious\n&gt; politics, an=\r\nd in particular with the role of various nexuses based overseas.\n&gt; So I dec=\r\nided to jump into the eye of the storm of this scandal in order to\n&gt; invest=\r\nigate whether similar nexuses were at work in this case. Naturally, at\n&gt; on=\r\ne level I have seen this scandal through the framework of a civilization\n&gt; =\r\nencounter in which Vedic culture is pitted against the Dravidian\n&gt; divisive=\r\nness that is being backed by Christian evangelism. At another level,\n&gt; I fo=\r\nund that the sensationalized media reports were too one-sided, and none\n&gt; o=\r\nf them had a single statement to report from the swami himself.\n&gt; Furthermo=\r\nre, there was chaos and mismanagement of the crisis from Swami\n&gt; Nithyanand=\r\na&#39;s inner circle. In hindsight, things might have turned out\n&gt; differently =\r\nhad they managed more sensibly and faster =96 which I will\n&gt; elaborate late=\r\nr in this article. Given this, another interest of mine has\n&gt; been to extra=\r\npolate important lessons from this episode for other Hindu\n&gt; organizations,=\r\n which I predict will face similar scandals as and when their\n&gt; weaknesses =\r\nbecome understood by those opposed to them. This article\n&gt; highlights my fi=\r\nndings at these multiple levels and issues.\n&gt; \n&gt; During this 2-week investi=\r\ngative period, I have been loyal to my pledge to\n&gt; give Swami Nithyananda&#39;s=\r\n organization the benefit of doubt and to report\n&gt; their side of the story.=\r\n Besides wanting to balance out the one-sided media\n&gt; depictions, I wanted =\r\naccess to the ashram&#39;s core group for my own research\n&gt; on the broader subj=\r\nect of civilization encounters. I respect the\n&gt; sensitivities of that organ=\r\nization consisting of many decent and dedicated\n&gt; devotees who have sacrifi=\r\nced a great deal and stand to lose a lot.\n&gt; \n&gt; But I have concluded that th=\r\ne situation is now beyond repair for Swami\n&gt; Nithyananda and that his conti=\r\nnued involvement can only damage the broader\n&gt; interests of dharma as well =\r\nas jeopardize the ashramites. Along with two\n&gt; other sympathizers who are n=\r\not ashramites, I have personally recommended to\n&gt; Swami Nithyananda that th=\r\ne best course at this stage would be for him to\n&gt; resign completely from hi=\r\ns organization. He should turn it over to a small\n&gt; team of senior Hindu ma=\r\nhatmas, so that the assets can be used in the best\n&gt; interests of dharma. F=\r\nurther, under the guidance of these mahatmas he must\n&gt; live a quiet life as=\r\n a sadhu devoid of any institutional responsibilities.\n&gt; Because the head o=\r\nf any organization must accept responsibility that &quot;the\n&gt; buck stops here,&quot;=\r\n only such a move can salvage the organization and the\n&gt; reputation of dhar=\r\nma at large. Over several years, this resignation would\n&gt; hopefully reduce =\r\nthe massive pressure that has built up against him\n&gt; personally, and enable=\r\n him to live peacefully as a sadhu. It is up to him to\n&gt; accept or reject t=\r\nhis advice. The basis for this conclusion becomes clearer\n&gt; once the reader=\r\n has gone through the rest of this article.\n&gt; I want to begin by examining =\r\nsome principles about the relationships between\n&gt; siddhis (extraordinary yo=\r\ngic powers), morality, Tantra and sex. This will\n&gt; provide the framework in=\r\n which to interpret what has happened. Then I will\n&gt; turn to my initial int=\r\nerest in pursuing the challenges facing Hinduism in\n&gt; south India from a va=\r\nriety of forces.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Siddhis (Extraordinary Yogic Powers) and Morality\n=\r\n&gt; A few days ago, I had the honor of having a two-hour private conversation=\r\n\n&gt; with Sri Sri Ravi Shankar at his ashram in Rishikesh. I introduced mysel=\r\nf as\n&gt; an independent researcher who is writing a series of books on Indian=\r\n\n&gt; civilization in the context of the global challenges and opportunities. =\r\nOne\n&gt; of my volumes will be specifically on the major global gurus since th=\r\ne 1960s\n&gt; =96 including Krishnamurti, Swami Muktananda, Maharishi Mahesh Yo=\r\ngi,\n&gt; Pabhupada, among others - as well as living global gurus such as Sri =\r\nSri\n&gt; himself. I have been investigating what happened to such gurus, in te=\r\nrms of\n&gt; the shifts in their Western followers over time, their scandals, t=\r\nheir\n&gt; Indian followers and critics, and also how each guru negotiated his/=\r\nher\n&gt; position sandwiched between Indian orthodoxy on one side and Western\n=\r\n&gt; modernity on the other. The relevance of this in the context of Swami\n&gt; N=\r\nithyananda will become clear very soon.\n&gt; \n&gt; The first provocative question=\r\n I asked Sri Sri concerned the nature of yogic\n&gt; powers: What is the relati=\r\nonship between siddhis and morality? If siddhis\n&gt; are a scientific phenomen=\r\na dealing with powers that can be harnessed by all\n&gt; humans then one must b=\r\near in mind that science deals with truths that are\n&gt; morally neutral. If E=\r\ninstein was declared to have lived an immoral life it\n&gt; would not invalidat=\r\ne his scientific theories. A person who designs aircrafts\n&gt; or any other co=\r\nmplex technological systems may or may not be moral in order\n&gt; to be effect=\r\nive in his technical work. In other words, rtam (the patterns of\n&gt; the cosm=\r\nos), which we discover and call science, functions independently of\n&gt; human=\r\n morality. This is why a scientific principle can be used either\n&gt; morally =\r\nor immorally, because it is independent of morality. There are moral\n&gt; pers=\r\nons who lack any siddhis or even ordinary scientific competence.\n&gt; Converse=\r\nly, there are great siddhas (like Ravana) who lack morality. Sri\n&gt; Sri&#39;s pr=\r\nanayama techniques would also produce results for an immoral person.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Sri Sri seemed impressed by this question, and agreed with my overall\n&gt; p=\r\nosition on the independence between siddhis and morality. But he pointed\n&gt; =\r\nout that the moral dimension, while not determining the siddhis, was also\n&gt;=\r\n important because it led to receiving the grace of the divine. I agree wit=\r\nh\n&gt; him.\n&gt; \n&gt; So there are two separate phenomena involved: (i) spiritual t=\r\nechnologies\n&gt; that are objective and that allow anyone to harness spiritual=\r\n energies, and\n&gt; (ii) morality which is important in itself, not for attain=\r\ning siddhis, but\n&gt; in order to have a positive relationship with the divine=\r\n. Either one can be\n&gt; developed without the other; however, the dharma trad=\r\nition encourages us to\n&gt; cultivate both. The reason that meditation systems=\r\n prescribe things like\n&gt; vegetarian diet, ahimsa, etc. is because an inappr=\r\nopriate lifestyle\n&gt; interferes with the mental tranquility required to adva=\r\nnce. This lifestyle\n&gt; change can be appreciated regardless of whether one b=\r\nelieves in a personal\n&gt; God or not. This absence of a personal God is clear=\r\n in Buddhist meditation.\n&gt; Different Hindu systems place different levels o=\r\nf emphasis upon a personal\n&gt; God for the yoga to function. This is why many=\r\n secular and scientifically\n&gt; minded persons are also drawn towards meditat=\r\nion techniques. In other words,\n&gt; something cannot be a science if it depen=\r\nds upon morality, because science\n&gt; is objective and stands independent of =\r\nmorality.\n&gt; \n&gt; The relevance of this question is as follows: Many persons w=\r\nho have learned\n&gt; advanced meditation from Swami Nithyananda want to know i=\r\nf any moral\n&gt; breaches by him would invalidate the whole Hindu claim of ach=\r\nieving higher\n&gt; states of consciousness. When a far worse sex scandal again=\r\nst the legendary\n&gt; Swami Muktananda emerged in the 1990s, involving charges=\r\n by a large number\n&gt; of his Western female disciples, the Western academy r=\r\nashly condemned not\n&gt; only one man&#39;s morality, but also the whole legitimac=\r\ny of the Indian\n&gt; tradition itself. In that series of debates (with RISA sc=\r\nholars like Sarah\n&gt; Caldwell, etc.), I took the same position then as I am =\r\ntaking now: that\n&gt; Muktananda&#39;s capabilities in harnessing spiritual energi=\r\nes are separate and\n&gt; independent from whether or not he violated any code =\r\nof morality.\n&gt; \n&gt; Patanjali warns against getting lured by siddhis which ap=\r\npear along the way\n&gt; when one practices advanced meditation persistently. O=\r\nne is not supposed to\n&gt; indulge in them. This warning is found in various H=\r\nindu systems that deal\n&gt; with the body as a vehicle for spiritual evolution=\r\n, because these energies\n&gt; are very powerful and can get out of control. An=\r\nother point that is worth\n&gt; noting is that the techniques taught by Swami N=\r\nithyananda are not his\n&gt; original ones; he has made it clear repeatedly tha=\r\nt they are from the Shiva\n&gt; Sutras which have a long history in our civiliz=\r\nation. I feel that he does\n&gt; have the siddhi of being able to transmit thes=\r\ne techniques very effectively\n&gt; to others. For instance, I have never befor=\r\ne in my life been able to sit\n&gt; still and alert in meditation for the whole=\r\n night, but he had a few hundred\n&gt; persons in a large hall achieving this. =\r\nThe point here is similar to saying\n&gt; that the mathematics and golf I have =\r\nlearned from someone is not invalidated\n&gt; when the teacher is found to be i=\r\nmmoral.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hence, the issue of his morality must be pursued separately an=\r\nd\n&gt; independently from whether his siddhis are genuine.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is Tantra a Pa=\r\nrt of Hinduism?\n&gt; \n&gt; The second question that I asked Sri Sri could not be =\r\ncompletely dealt with\n&gt; in the time available for our meeting. I hope to pu=\r\nrsue this some day with\n&gt; him and with various other acharyas for my own be=\r\nnefit. Its significance in\n&gt; the present scandal becomes clear soon. I aske=\r\nd whether the Shiva Sutras are\n&gt; valid, pointing out that among the 112 spi=\r\nritual enlightenment techniques\n&gt; taught in them, about 6 deal with sexual =\r\ncontact between a male yogi and a\n&gt; female yogini. Kashmir Shaivism as well=\r\n as the Tantra traditions have\n&gt; included exemplars that practiced these te=\r\nchniques. Recently, Osho tried to\n&gt; revive them and nowadays Deepak Chopra =\r\nhas brought some elements of these\n&gt; into his repertoire. Sunthar Visuvalin=\r\ngam, a US based scholar of Tantra and\n&gt; Kashmir Shaivism, is one of the voi=\r\nces who brings out the authenticity of\n&gt; these approaches in the tradition,=\r\n despite the common rejections by society\n&gt; at large. The tradition conside=\r\nrs itself not suitable for mainstream society\n&gt; and is meant only for a sma=\r\nll subset of people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many popular Hindu rituals and symbols have emerg=\r\ned out of the Tantra\n&gt; traditions =96 such as Shiva lingam, etc. The Tantra=\r\n and Vedic traditions were\n&gt; not separate until recent times. The Vedic-Tan=\r\ntric integration is found in\n&gt; Adi Shankara all the way to Jiva Goswami (th=\r\ne great integrator of\n&gt; Vaishnavism who took Ramanuja&#39;s ideas further), and=\r\n even more recently in\n&gt; the life of Sri Ramakrishna. The Bihar School of Y=\r\noga has Tantra\n&gt; practitioners, but they do it privately and not publicly.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I have an unpublished monograph that shows the history of this shift i=\r\nn\n&gt; Indian consciousness concerning Tantra. It was under British rule that\n=\r\n&gt; certain Indian leaders (such as Ram Mohan Roy) started to condemn (as par=\r\nt\n&gt; of their &quot;reform&quot; of Hinduism) those aspects of Hinduism that bothered\n=\r\n&gt; puritan Christian values. It must be noted that Christianity has had a ve=\r\nry\n&gt; negative posture towards the human body starting with the Biblical epi=\r\nsode\n&gt; of Origin Sin. This is why female priests (called &quot;witches&quot;) got dem=\r\nonized\n&gt; by the Church in its very official genocide of several million pra=\r\nctitioners\n&gt; across Europe. This Church prosecution was called the Inquisit=\r\nion and was\n&gt; widespread for a few centuries. The use of shakti and anythin=\r\ng concerning\n&gt; the body as a spiritual resource was considered not only imm=\r\noral but also\n&gt; demonic, and was outlawed with draconian enforcement. The t=\r\nerm &quot;occult&quot; was\n&gt; used to refer to a vast assortment of such practices and=\r\n was heavily\n&gt; condemned by the Church as the work of the Devil.\n&gt; This men=\r\ntality entered India under the British. The Criminal Tribes Act of\n&gt; India =\r\nwas passed by the British in the late 1800s. It listed several dozen\n&gt; trib=\r\nes that practiced such &quot;evil&quot; techniques, and they were officially\n&gt; persec=\r\nuted into extinction. A middle-class &quot;whitened&quot; Hinduism evolved as\n&gt; the m=\r\nark of being &quot;civilized&quot; on British terms. We could thus be proud of\n&gt; our =\r\nidentity, now that it was &quot;cleansed&quot; of &quot;primitive&quot; practices of our\n&gt; ance=\r\nstors.\n&gt; \n&gt; In this history of removing Tantra out of Hinduism, some people=\r\n include\n&gt; Swami Vivekananda among those who undermined Tantra. I disagree =\r\nwith this\n&gt; charge. He was saying a separate set of things to his Western a=\r\nudiences than\n&gt; to Indians. In his Western lecture tours, he presented a Hi=\r\nnduism that\n&gt; Westerners could relate to and appreciate, but he did not ask=\r\n Indians to\n&gt; shift their practice. It is unfortunate that after his death,=\r\n the\n&gt; Ramakrishna Mission he started has diluted itself into a sort of\n&gt; p=\r\nseudo-Christianity. Kali and other related Tantra deities, symbols and\n&gt; ri=\r\ntuals that were dear to Ramakrishna himself, have become &quot;hidden&quot; for the\n&gt;=\r\n &quot;private&quot; use by the monks, but are marginalized publicly and considered a=\r\ns\n&gt; an embarrassment. Their lead in this direction has spread across modern=\r\n\n&gt; Hinduism to such an extent that Vedic Hinduism has become separated from=\r\n\n&gt; Tantra, and Tantra is now widely condemned by many Hindu gurus. This is =\r\nalso\n&gt; a factor that worked against Swami Nithyananda&#39;s reputation among or=\r\nthodox\n&gt; Hindu leaders, for he uses Tantric techniques that arouse body ene=\r\nrgies,\n&gt; such as kundalini.\n&gt; \n&gt; My own feeling is that Tantra is making a =\r\nbig comeback. First there was\n&gt; Western popularity of distorted versions of=\r\n Tantra; but this is now being\n&gt; followed by more clinical experimentation =\r\nby psychologists and others. The\n&gt; whole issue of latent human energies and=\r\n potentials (both positive and\n&gt; dangerous) is a hot topic of serious scien=\r\ntific investigation. Hindus should\n&gt; reclaim this aspect of their own tradi=\r\ntion rather than waiting for U-Turned\n&gt; (appropriated) versions to get re-e=\r\nxported back to India, packaged as &quot;Made\n&gt; in USA&quot; spiritual science. This =\r\nrequires an attitude of experimentation\n&gt; under the appropriate controls to=\r\n prevent abuses and quackery.\n&gt; \n&gt; I just returned from Kumbh Mela where I =\r\nwalked amidst several tens of\n&gt; thousands of naga sadhus who were completel=\r\ny naked. I did not consider them\n&gt; as either vulgar or primitive. The old g=\r\nuard of Hindu orthodoxy rejects\n&gt; Tantra at least in public, and yet lives =\r\nin contradictions because they do\n&gt; respect the naga sadhus and also the va=\r\nrious symbols and rituals that have\n&gt; their foundations in Tantra. The vacu=\r\num left by avoiding the subject of\n&gt; Tantra has created opportunities for t=\r\nhe likes of Wendy Doniger to formulate\n&gt; distorted interpretations. I feel =\r\nthat Hindu spiritual practitioners as well\n&gt; as intellectuals must take bac=\r\nk control over Tantra as an intrinsic part of\n&gt; our tradition.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sex and=\r\n Morality\n&gt; \n&gt; Against this backdrop, I will address the issue of Swami Nit=\r\nhyananda&#39;s\n&gt; morality. Just to recap:\n&gt; My first point above has been that =\r\nthe morality issue about Swami\n&gt; Nithyananda does not impact the effectiven=\r\ness of the meditation techniques\n&gt; he has taught very successfully. Their e=\r\nfficacy is best evaluated by the\n&gt; tens of thousands of practitioners for t=\r\nhemselves.\n&gt; My second point was that there is nothing inherent about sex t=\r\nhat is\n&gt; rejected by Hinduism across the board, although certain strains of=\r\n Hinduism\n&gt; do reject sex seeing it as harmful to spirituality.\n&gt; Here it m=\r\nust be noted that brahmacharya (involving sexual abstinence) is\n&gt; just one =\r\nof the spiritual paths of Hinduism. The first half of my recent\n&gt; stay in H=\r\naridwar was as a guest of the Gayatri Pariwar, one of the greatest\n&gt; and la=\r\nrgest Hindu movements, that does not advocate being brahmachari. Its\n&gt; foun=\r\nder, its present head and its members at large, are householders and not\n&gt; =\r\nbrahmacharis. But for Swami Nithyananda to claim moral authenticity under\n&gt;=\r\n this system, he would have to pronounce himself as a householder and not a=\r\n\n&gt; sannyasin. He has never done that, so we must examine his morality by so=\r\nme\n&gt; other criteria.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another approach for him could have been to annou=\r\nnce himself as an\n&gt; experimenter of Tantra for modern times, thereby making=\r\n himself transparent\n&gt; of any such charges. This would place him in the sam=\r\ne category as Osho. Many\n&gt; times in his public discourses and teachings, he=\r\n has praised Osho as his\n&gt; greatest teacher and enlightened exemplar. He ev=\r\nen said that many of his own\n&gt; teachings were derived from Osho. But he fai=\r\nled to publicly clarify whether\n&gt; he was practicing those techniques that i=\r\nnvolve sex. Privately, he explained\n&gt; to me in recent days that Shiva Sutra=\r\ns have two categories of techniques.\n&gt; Most of the sutras do not involve ph=\r\nysical contact with another person and\n&gt; only use the four senses of sight,=\r\n sound, taste and smell as pathways to\n&gt; spiritual experiences. Hence an in=\r\ndividual practices these techniques\n&gt; entirely on his/her own. This path is=\r\n what he has taught thus far to the\n&gt; public. The best pursuit of this path=\r\n is as a brahamachari according to him,\n&gt; and he has initiated many followe=\r\nrs into it. But for a small number of\n&gt; persons, he feels that the 6 sutras=\r\n involving sexual Tantra need to be\n&gt; tested and perfected for modern times=\r\n, before they can be safely taught more\n&gt; widely. This he considers to be l=\r\nike any R & D done in a lab for developing\n&gt; a product.\n&gt; My sense is that =\r\nhe did practice Tantra with a very small number of persons,\n&gt; and I believe=\r\n that he even entered into written legal contracts with them to\n&gt; make sure=\r\n that both parties were clear about the arrangement. The reason for\n&gt; this =\r\n&quot;Non-Disclosure Agreement&quot; was to make sure that someone who willingly\n&gt; ap=\r\nproaches him for Tantra does not later accuse him of inappropriate\n&gt; physic=\r\nal contact. On March 9 (about a week ago), I did a specific video\n&gt; intervi=\r\new with him dealing with this issue very specifically. But this video\n&gt; was=\r\n blocked by his ashram leaders even though he personally felt that it was\n&gt;=\r\n a good idea to show it. I gave up arguing in favor of showing it, because\n=\r\n&gt; his ashram management took a firm stand against it. I still feel that thi=\r\ns\n&gt; was a blunder they made. Swami Nithyananda is very forthright and clear=\r\n in\n&gt; that interview =96 I felt that it was the best interview of all the o=\r\nnes I did\n&gt; with him, but it was never made public.\n&gt; I surmise that Ranjit=\r\nha, the Tamil actress in the scandalous videotape, was\n&gt; practicing Tantra =\r\nwith him. He taught her the self-control she had to\n&gt; achieve before any in=\r\ntimacy. I have tried to interview her in order to get\n&gt; her side of the sto=\r\nry, but so far I have not succeeded in getting through to\n&gt; her. Based on t=\r\nhird party reports from some persons who are in touch with\n&gt; her, and the m=\r\nedia reports of her statements, her stance seems to be along\n&gt; the followin=\r\ng lines: She took the sexual initiative with him on the occasion\n&gt; shown in=\r\n the videotape, at a time when he was not fully alert. But this\n&gt; activity =\r\ndid not proceed to intercourse. It was terminated. She has also\n&gt; said that=\r\n the videos being shown on TV are manipulated versions of what\n&gt; actually h=\r\nappened, because they exaggerate the situation. They do not show\n&gt; portions=\r\n where he asked her to stop. Different clips from various videos\n&gt; seem to =\r\nhave been turned into a single video by editing. She has not filed\n&gt; any co=\r\nmplaint against him. So in the worst case, this was consensual sex\n&gt; betwee=\r\nn adults, and that too backed by a formal written contract between the\n&gt; pa=\r\nrties. Because she has refused to give any statement against Swami\n&gt; Nithya=\r\nnanda, she feels threatened by those who set her up and who did this\n&gt; stin=\r\ng operation. I hear that she has gone overseas to protect her safety\n&gt; from=\r\n this mafia-like conspiracy. I have not been able to corroborate this\n&gt; the=\r\nsis directly from her.\n&gt; \n&gt; My concern about his morality is, therefore, no=\r\nt based on sex between\n&gt; consenting adults. Rather, my moral issue is about=\r\n the lack of transparency\n&gt; before the public. He could have openly said th=\r\nat he wants to select a few\n&gt; yoginis to experiment Tantra under mutual con=\r\nsent. At worst this would have\n&gt; upset many followers and pushed them away.=\r\n In response to my concern over\n&gt; his lack of transparency, he could offer =\r\nthe argument that this was a\n&gt; private activity between adults who are unde=\r\nr no obligation to disclose it\n&gt; to the public. After all, people do not go=\r\n about broadcasting their sexual\n&gt; lives. So long as this was under mutual =\r\nconsent, he might say, it cannot be\n&gt; an offense. And if it was done under =\r\nthe Tantra portions of the Shiva Sutra,\n&gt; it was also an act within the Hin=\r\ndu tradition despite the controversy\n&gt; surrounding Tantra today.\n&gt; \n&gt; Havin=\r\ng given this best case argument on his behalf, I must say that there\n&gt; coul=\r\nd also be the alternative scenario, namely, that this was mere lust\n&gt; packa=\r\nged as Tantric spirituality. David White, one of Wendy&#39;s Children, has\n&gt; wr=\r\nitten extensively making the claim that all Tantra is &quot;hard core porn&quot;\n&gt; th=\r\nat gets wrapped up before the public in metaphysical mumbo-jumbo to appear\n=\r\n&gt; to be legitimate spirituality, which he calls &quot;soft porn&quot; coating. White&#39;=\r\ns\n&gt; latest book takes this allegation to the extreme, and states that all m=\r\najor\n&gt; yogic exemplars in Indian history were basically not engaged in any =\r\nkind of\n&gt; spirituality at all. Instead, he claims, they were developing per=\r\nsonal power\n&gt; for the purpose of exploiting others. I am unqualified to com=\r\nment on whether\n&gt; Swami Nithyananda&#39;s case fits this notion of &quot;soft porn,&quot;=\r\n or whether it was\n&gt; legitimate Tantra. Nor do I have adequate factual data=\r\n of what happened to\n&gt; pass judgment either way.\n&gt; This concludes what I ha=\r\nve to say about his morality issue as shown in the\n&gt; sex tapes.\n&gt; \n&gt; My Imp=\r\nressions of Swami Nithyananda Prior to this Scandal\n&gt; I was introduced to S=\r\nwami Nithyananda a couple of years ago, by a prominent\n&gt; Hindu leader based=\r\n in California. This man was so impressed by the young\n&gt; swami that he freq=\r\nuently called me to speak about him in glowing terms. I\n&gt; told him that I h=\r\nad a guru already, and that my present interest in\n&gt; interacting with gurus=\r\n was mainly as a part of my research for my book on\n&gt; global gurus. He arra=\r\nnged a private meeting for me with Swami Nithyananda,\n&gt; which I used mostly=\r\n to explain the civilization threats facing Hinduism,\n&gt; citing numerous exa=\r\nmples, and questioned him on his position in this regard.\n&gt; I found him to =\r\nbe very sharp, a great listener, and in agreement that we\n&gt; must engage soc=\r\nial issues rather than pursuing the &quot;world negating&quot; or\n&gt; &quot;escapist&quot; paths =\r\nthat are typical of many gurus today.\n&gt; Later on, I attended a weekend cour=\r\nse in USA where he taught the Patanjali\n&gt; Yoga Sutras. I have read several =\r\ntranslations of this great classical work,\n&gt; but I had never before seen it=\r\n taught experientially. Swami Nithyananda gave\n&gt; the attendees their own pe=\r\nrsonal inner experience of every one of the eight\n&gt; limbs of Patanjali&#39;s sy=\r\nstem, right up to and including samadhi. This was\n&gt; quite an achievement in=\r\n two days.\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, my interactions with him remained centered largely=\r\n on the\n&gt; geopolitics of religions. I saw him as a prominent swami who was =\r\nnot running\n&gt; away from troubling issues, such as Christian conversions and=\r\n the\n&gt; Dravidianization of Tamil identity. Given that I have been writing a=\r\n book\n&gt; for three years (now in the editing stage) on this very issue as it=\r\n exists\n&gt; in Tamil Nadu, I was especially impressed by his experimental pro=\r\ngram of a\n&gt; Hindu temple on wheels traveling from village to village. In ea=\r\nch village\n&gt; this mobile temple stops and offers chanting, a talk by one of=\r\n the leaders,\n&gt; food, medicines, etc. So it combines religion with social s=\r\nervice and thus\n&gt; competes directly against Christian evangelism. Rather th=\r\nan building a\n&gt; temple in every village and needing a purohit in each of th=\r\ne thousands of\n&gt; villages across Tamil Nadu, the strategy was to bring to e=\r\nach village this\n&gt; &quot;temple on wheels.&quot; What I discovered by my own independ=\r\nent fact-finding was\n&gt; that wherever this temple on wheels went, the missio=\r\nnaries were upset\n&gt; because it blunted their conversion efforts.\n&gt; I attend=\r\ned his 21-day meditation program in December 2009. The various\n&gt; techniques=\r\n in it are very deep and transformative. The best evaluation of\n&gt; this can =\r\nbe done by the hundreds of attendees, who were divided roughly\n&gt; equally be=\r\ntween Indians and whites from North America.\n&gt; \n&gt; In several side conversat=\r\nions with him as well in the public forum, I\n&gt; pursued the point that I alr=\r\neady have a guru since 1994, so I was not\n&gt; looking for a new guru. Since m=\r\ny guru had left the body a few years ago, I\n&gt; wanted to continue learning n=\r\new techniques for my practice. I explained to\n&gt; him that I had previously l=\r\nearned and practiced meditation techniques from\n&gt; multiple sources for over=\r\n 30 years, including: Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, Sri\n&gt; Sri Ravi Shankar, Yogi A=\r\nmrit Desai (who certified me as a teacher), Deepak\n&gt; Chopra, Vipassana, and=\r\n more. Additionally, I had practiced numerous bhakti\n&gt; traditions, as well =\r\nas formal Vedanta education from Swami Chinmayananda and\n&gt; Ramakrishna Miss=\r\nion. I went through a serious study of the writings by Sri\n&gt; Aurobindo, var=\r\nious Madhyamika Buddhist systems, Kashmir Shaivism, Ramana\n&gt; Maharshi, etc.=\r\n So I was not seeking a new guru like most others who took his\n&gt; courses.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I have to say that he never pressured me to adopt him as my new guru, a=\r\nnd\n&gt; even said that one must remain loyal to one&#39;s guru. To be classified a=\r\ns a\n&gt; devotee/disciple of his, there are two criteria, neither of which app=\r\nlies to\n&gt; me. First, there is an optional program one can sign up for, to d=\r\no &quot;paada\n&gt; puja&quot; at the guru&#39;s feet, in order to develop a special link wit=\r\nh him. The\n&gt; second is that one can ask to be given an initiation with a ne=\r\nw name, in\n&gt; which case his policy is that the person must legally change h=\r\nis/her name,\n&gt; and use this new name publicly. I did not do either of these=\r\n steps. So my\n&gt; relationship is not as a devotee or disciple, but more arms=\r\n-length.\n&gt; \n&gt; It was a two-way street. While he taught me meditation, I bro=\r\nught to him my\n&gt; scholarship on the geopolitical positioning of Hinduism wh=\r\nich I feel the\n&gt; gurus know only superficially. They do not adequately know=\r\n things like:\n&gt; Western philosophy, neither of the religious nor the secula=\r\nr variety; or\n&gt; Western history; or Western institutions that have been set=\r\n up explicitly to\n&gt; spread its civilization; or various global campaigns un=\r\nder way to invade\n&gt; Indian civilization through conversions, education, med=\r\nia, political\n&gt; policymaking and more.\n&gt; \n&gt; He requested that I should pres=\r\nent him my findings on such matters so that\n&gt; he and his senior acharyas co=\r\nuld learn. I told him that most gurus have\n&gt; little time to listen attentiv=\r\nely to a layperson like me, because the gurus\n&gt; like to do all the talking.=\r\n He replied that he would sit and listen to me\n&gt; seriously. I made it clear=\r\n that I was disinterested in giving a short talk\n&gt; of a few minutes, becaus=\r\ne my findings required considerable time to be\n&gt; examined seriously. I told=\r\n him that I would need two full days of undivided\n&gt; attention, so that I co=\r\nuld present 300 Powerpoint slides.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Nithyananda sent me an invita=\r\ntion when I was in Delhi to visit his\n&gt; ashram and present my research. I w=\r\nas delighted to have such an important\n&gt; audience. I was very impressed by =\r\nthe fact that he sat through two long days\n&gt; of my talks, about 12 hours pe=\r\nr day. He asked his 40 top acharyas and\n&gt; various thought leaders in his as=\r\nhram to sit and listen to me for both the\n&gt; days. The interactions were int=\r\nense, and I explained many points from my\n&gt; forthcoming books. I felt that =\r\nhe and I had a peer relationship, each side\n&gt; being an expert in his domain=\r\n to teach the other. After my two days of talks\n&gt; were over, he asked me to=\r\n help him incorporate my core ideas into his\n&gt; curriculum, so as to make su=\r\nre that his teachings helped position the Vedic\n&gt; civilization properly.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; No other guru in the world has invested so much time with me to try and\n=\r\n&gt; learn these global issues so deeply. (The only other prominent guru I kno=\r\nw\n&gt; personally who understands these issues about the external challenges i=\r\ns\n&gt; Swami Dayananda Saraswati.) Most gurus tend to either be dismissive by\n=\r\n&gt; resorting to spiritual loftiness, or imagine that they already know whate=\r\nver\n&gt; there is worth knowing. Thus, my primary interest in Swami Nithyanand=\r\na was\n&gt; as a vehicle to spread greater awareness of the kinds of issues tha=\r\nt I was\n&gt; researching. (For instance, he bought a couple of hundred copies =\r\nof the\n&gt; book, &quot;Invading the Sacred&quot; at the full price, and made it require=\r\nd reading\n&gt; for all his ashram residents.)\n&gt; \n&gt; I must balance this praise =\r\nwith criticism. In my 2-day talks, I had\n&gt; explicitly discussed that many g=\r\nurus were falling prey to sex scandals,\n&gt; often with women planted as part =\r\nof sting operations, or women in the inner\n&gt; circle who got too close and l=\r\net things get out of control. Despite these\n&gt; warnings, it seems that nothi=\r\nng concrete was done to prevent or at least\n&gt; anticipate the crisis that wa=\r\ns to follow.\n&gt; \n&gt; My Approach to this Investigation\n&gt; \n&gt; When the scandal b=\r\nroke out I was in Delhi. I called the Bangalore ashram\n&gt; management and fou=\r\nnd them confident but confused. Probably they felt that\n&gt; the matter would =\r\nsoon get forgotten if left alone. But exactly the opposite\n&gt; happened, as e=\r\nach day brought fresh allegations and sensational media\n&gt; coverage. After s=\r\neveral days had passed I was invited to go to Bangalore to\n&gt; study the situ=\r\nation for myself. At that time I had no clue about his Tantra\n&gt; practice wi=\r\nth any women. Whatever I knew was based on what his followers\n&gt; told me, be=\r\ncause he was personally inaccessible for several days even after\n&gt; I reache=\r\nd Bangalore. I spent many hours daily with some of his ashram&#39;s top\n&gt; team.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; What I wrote earlier in this article actually comes later in the chro=\r\nnology\n&gt; of my investigation. But I presented it up front because most read=\r\ners are\n&gt; obsessed with getting my answer to only one single question: did =\r\nhe or did\n&gt; he not have sex? Nothing else seems to matter to them, whereas =\r\nmy\n&gt; investigation&#39;s emphasis has been about issues broader and more\n&gt; cons=\r\nequential than any one man&#39;s morality.\n&gt; \n&gt; Until I concluded my fact-findi=\r\nng 2-week period recently, I was unable to\n&gt; discuss the sexual acts shown =\r\nin the videotapes. I had to respect the\n&gt; policies of his people as part of=\r\n the trust being placed in me to gain\n&gt; access. They also needed legal clea=\r\nrance on what can and cannot be said by\n&gt; them. Their policy on the sex tap=\r\nes was that Swami Nithyananda would\n&gt; directly explain his acts. The Tamil =\r\nactress&#39; lawyer was also in contact\n&gt; with them and her sensitivities had t=\r\no be respected. The sensitivities of\n&gt; the 140-strong ashramites had to be =\r\nprotected also. Given this set of\n&gt; circumstances facing me, I feel that it=\r\n was unfair to demand that I should\n&gt; hound him with the one critical quest=\r\nion. People have assumed that it was up\n&gt; to me to decide what would be wit=\r\nhin the scope of each interview. As I have\n&gt; mentioned earlier, even after =\r\ncertain interviews were recorded by me, the\n&gt; ashram leadership used its di=\r\nscretion not to air them.\n&gt; \n&gt; In response to my critics on how I conducted=\r\n my interviews, I would also\n&gt; like to explain why I chose to focus on the =\r\ncriminal charges being made\n&gt; against Swami Nithyananda. Besides the sex-ta=\r\npe being off limits as\n&gt; mentioned in the foregoing paragraph, the criminal=\r\n charges became my focus\n&gt; for two reasons. These charges could be ascertai=\r\nned with objectivity =96 such\n&gt; as asking for documents on the land ownersh=\r\nip, the medical reports on the\n&gt; death of one meditation participant 2 year=\r\ns ago, and so forth. The evidence\n&gt; was more clear-cut than the evidence on=\r\n what exactly happened in the\n&gt; videotapes between two persons none of whom=\r\n were willing to talk with me\n&gt; about it. Secondly, the consequences of cri=\r\nminality would be far more severe\n&gt; than mere moral fallibility. While immo=\r\nral conduct is a big concern for the\n&gt; devotees, it is not enough grounds b=\r\ny itself for the state to confiscate the\n&gt; entire property that runs into v=\r\nery large sums of money. Also, as a matter\n&gt; of principle, regardless of wh=\r\nether or not he is guilty of the morality\n&gt; charge, I felt opposed to spuri=\r\nous criminal charges being piled up by the\n&gt; irresponsible media just to cr=\r\neate sensationalism.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Conspiracy against Swami Nithyananda\n&gt; \n&gt; Sin=\r\nce I had arrived at the scene while writing my book on the conspiracy in\n&gt; =\r\nTamil Nadu religious politics, it was natural to start with that as my\n&gt; em=\r\nphasis for the investigation. But in this short article I have decided to\n&gt;=\r\n focus on the matters surrounding his conduct and his organization&#39;s conduc=\r\nt,\n&gt; because these have assumed a more urgent nature. The details of the\n&gt; =\r\nconspiracy belong in my book as corroborating evidence for my thesis there.=\r\n\n&gt; The types of parties reported to be behind the conspiracy, both foreign =\r\nand\n&gt; India based, were remarkably similar to the ones I have written about=\r\n in the\n&gt; book. So for now I shall merely summarize some of the main points=\r\n concerning\n&gt; this conspiracy.\n&gt; \n&gt; First one must understand why Swami Nit=\r\nhyananda became such a target. He was\n&gt; virtually unknown 7 years ago, but =\r\nonce he appeared in public his popularity\n&gt; catapulted at a dramatic rate. =\r\nFor example, last year, YouTube wrote to him\n&gt; that he was the most watched=\r\n of all Indian spiritual leaders on the Internet\n&gt; and proposed a closer co=\r\nllaboration for their viewers. This letter also\n&gt; stated that among all spi=\r\nritual leaders worldwide (not just Indian) he was\n&gt; the second most popular=\r\n one, the Vatican being first. His meditation\n&gt; programs have become very p=\r\nopular in USA and in certain Indian states. The\n&gt; main factors are that par=\r\nticipants almost invariably report experiencing\n&gt; higher states of consciou=\r\nsness, and he has healed a large number of persons\n&gt; of a variety of diseas=\r\nes. His healing powers are what brought together his\n&gt; core inner group of =\r\ndevotees from around the world =96 doctors, businessmen,\n&gt; IT professionals=\r\n, corporate executives. Many of them have explained their\n&gt; personal healin=\r\ngs from terminal illnesses as the turning point in their\n&gt; lives. His medit=\r\nation programs sometimes bring up to a few thousand\n&gt; attendees for periods=\r\n ranging from a few days to several weeks.\n&gt; \n&gt; While the funds come mostly=\r\n from upper strata participants in India and USA,\n&gt; a large portion of the =\r\nexpenses have been allocated to develop grass-roots\n&gt; social and spiritual =\r\nprograms focusing primarily in Tamil Nadu, his native\n&gt; state. This is wher=\r\ne he is seen as a threat by Dravidian as well as\n&gt; Christian forces. For in=\r\nstance, in December 2009, about 600 villages across\n&gt; Tamil Nadu sent their=\r\n local &quot;Nithyananda leaders&quot; for a celebration and\n&gt; planning session in hi=\r\ns main ashram near Bangalore. I happened to be present\n&gt; for the event. The=\r\nse common folks, mostly from the lower strata of Tamil\n&gt; society, had walke=\r\nd 300 kilometers for this journey, which they saw as a\n&gt; spiritual pilgrima=\r\nge. The reason for the anger of Christian and Dravidian\n&gt; forces is that hi=\r\ns activities have put a dampener to conversions in many\n&gt; districts, and se=\r\nveral Christians have returned to Hinduism by getting\n&gt; initiated formally =\r\ninto his organization. The swami himself has spoken\n&gt; against conversions, =\r\nand has also stated that the Dravidian movement had\n&gt; made Tamil people uns=\r\npiritual in their lives, and that this had caused\n&gt; social decay. His Tamil=\r\n language publications and courses have become his\n&gt; most popular ones, far=\r\n exceeding the numbers in English. Also he is a very\n&gt; big threat because h=\r\ne is not a Brahmin. Because he cannot be targeted using\n&gt; the classic attac=\r\nk strategies used on Brahmins, and because the masses in\n&gt; Tamil Nadu were =\r\nrising to swell his ranks, the threat he posed to the\n&gt; existing political =\r\npower structure had to be stopped one way or another.\n&gt; \n&gt; The attack again=\r\nst Swami Nithyananda has consisted of two prongs, destroying\n&gt; his image an=\r\nd alleging legal misdeeds. At first a highly sensational sexual\n&gt; charge wa=\r\ns broadcast in order to devastate his credibility and create an\n&gt; atmospher=\r\ne in which any and all kinds of outlandish allegations would be\n&gt; taken at =\r\nface value. Once the media and popular sentiments had been turned\n&gt; against=\r\n him, there was one amazing allegation after another in rapid\n&gt; sequence. I=\r\nt was clear that none of this was spontaneous but was being\n&gt; centrally orc=\r\nhestrated under a systematic plan.\n&gt; \n&gt; What became evident to me was that =\r\nthere was &quot;cooperation&quot; in informal and\n&gt; unofficial ways among the media, =\r\npolice and lower level judiciary. In fact,\n&gt; many third parties were aware =\r\nof the attack in advance and had warned his\n&gt; people before it happened wit=\r\nh specific details of the plan. For instance,\n&gt; one of his top devotees got=\r\n a phone call from someone based in New York\n&gt; describing the media and pol=\r\nice attack that was to come. His predictions\n&gt; turned out to be accurate bu=\r\nt at that time the ashramites did not take the\n&gt; threat literally. He said =\r\nthat for the right sum of money he could be\n&gt; helpful in preventing such an=\r\n attack. He claimed that the planning for this\n&gt; attack had started a year =\r\nago. He mentioned that a budget of Rs 200 crores\n&gt; was allocated by some ov=\r\nerseas groups to demolish Hindu gurus especially in\n&gt; south India, and name=\r\nd two south Indian churches as the nodal agencies to\n&gt; coordinate this stra=\r\ntegic plan. (I am presently pursuing these leads as part\n&gt; of my book inves=\r\ntigation.)\n&gt; There was another concrete extortion effort about eleven or tw=\r\nelve days\n&gt; prior to the scandal breaking out. A lawyer contacted them and =\r\nclaimed that\n&gt; his client had compromising videos, and that the client was =\r\nseeking money or\n&gt; else they would get released. The same intermediary late=\r\nr sent a letter\n&gt; containing a variety of unsubstantiated criminal allegati=\r\nons against Swami\n&gt; Nithyananda, and this letter&#39;s distribution list includ=\r\ned India&#39;s Prime\n&gt; Minister, President, Sonya Gandhi and Rahul Gandhi, vari=\r\nous Chief Ministers\n&gt; and police heads, various national criminal investiga=\r\ntion and security\n&gt; organizations. I have a copy of this letter, and it mak=\r\nes the Nithyananda\n&gt; organization seem like a terrorist outfit that needs t=\r\no be attacked for the\n&gt; sake of public safety. This letter along with a DVD=\r\n of the sex video was\n&gt; delivered to the Chief Minister of Karnataka state =\r\ntwo hours before the\n&gt; videotape was first aired. Clearly, the attack was w=\r\nell planned and executed\n&gt; across many locations, and was persistently carr=\r\nied out over several days.\n&gt; This is not the work of some isolated individu=\r\nals.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were warnings given to individuals in the ashram that their=\r\n phones\n&gt; were being tapped and that they better leave to save their own li=\r\nves,\n&gt; because something horrible was about to happen. One friendly man bas=\r\ned in\n&gt; Pune who runs a magazine and is a devotee of Swami Nithyananda, tol=\r\nd the\n&gt; ashram a week in advance of the attack that some such catastrophe w=\r\nould\n&gt; happen. He named his source as a man in the Bangalore Press Club. An=\r\nother\n&gt; publisher in Hyderabad who distributes Swami Nithyananda&#39;s books in=\r\n Telugu,\n&gt; called three times to warn that a graphic video would be release=\r\nd and gave a\n&gt; precise time for this to happen. It was also reported that a=\r\nn American\n&gt; devotee who had fallen out of the ashram was working in associ=\r\nation with one\n&gt; Jody Razdik who specializes in guru bashing at a prominent=\r\n web site. He was\n&gt; being helped by an Indian based in San Diego, who was o=\r\nnce very deeply\n&gt; involved inside the Nithyananda organization but had turn=\r\ned malicious. The\n&gt; only man who has openly come out as the main accuser wa=\r\ns an ashramite who\n&gt; had a falling out when he got demoted due to his condu=\r\nct. It was recently\n&gt; reported that he had a prior criminal record against =\r\nhim but nobody in the\n&gt; ashram had checked out his background before admitt=\r\ning him.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were constant threats received to harass the ashramites=\r\n and scare them\n&gt; away, with claims that &quot;narcotics will be planted to caus=\r\ne arrest warrants.&quot;\n&gt; The actions by the police were being leaked to the me=\r\ndia ahead of time and\n&gt; even to the opposing side, leading to numerous &quot;tip=\r\ns&quot; received by &quot;friends&quot;\n&gt; asking the ashram dwellers to run away before &quot;t=\r\nhe attack comes.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; But even after a couple of weeks since the scandal h=\r\nas erupted, the lawyers\n&gt; for Swami Nithyananda&#39;s ashram have failed to get=\r\n copies of any concrete\n&gt; charges filed with the police, except a few trivi=\r\nal ones. Each time they\n&gt; approach for specific details they are told that =\r\nthere is no formal charge,\n&gt; except relatively minor ones. So the intimidat=\r\nion has been carried out\n&gt; mainly through media reports, without any legal =\r\ndue process starting where\n&gt; facts and arguments could get cross-examined. =\r\nThis lack of formal charges\n&gt; has enabled an atmosphere of intimidation usi=\r\nng rumors and threats that\n&gt; cannot be pinned down officially.\n&gt; \n&gt; It is i=\r\nmportant to contrast this with the manner in which Indian media\n&gt; treats sc=\r\nandals facing Islamic or Christian groups. The numerous scandals\n&gt; occurrin=\r\ng overseas often get blocked by Indian media entirely, or are given\n&gt; mild =\r\ntreatment with tremendous sensitivity, in order to be seen as &quot;secular&quot;\n&gt; a=\r\nnd not &quot;communal.&quot; By contrast every kind of allegation against any Hindu\n&gt;=\r\n group gets clubbed in one homogeneous category and treated as a social\n&gt; s=\r\ncourge equivalent to terror groups.\n&gt; \n&gt; The media&#39;s hounding mentality and=\r\n mafia tactics deserve to be condemned. In\n&gt; the Swami Nithyananda case, th=\r\ney have used carrots and sticks to lure and\n&gt; threaten, using whatever woul=\r\nd get them more sensational footage. Several TV\n&gt; stations and journalists =\r\ncamped out in Haridwar and sent me emails\n&gt; requesting my help in arranging=\r\n an interview. When I failed to deliver\n&gt; (because it was not up to me to d=\r\neliver any such thing), some of them turned\n&gt; nasty against me. One TV woma=\r\nn promised the swami&#39;s people &quot;positive&quot;\n&gt; coverage if she got an exclusive=\r\n. But after the interview, she betrayed them\n&gt; and turned it into more dist=\r\nortion and smut. This led Swami Nithyananda&#39;s\n&gt; handlers to give interviews=\r\n to more stations in order to counteract this\n&gt; distortion. But the more th=\r\ney said before TV cameras, the worse the scandal\n&gt; became. One station was =\r\nblatant in its threat to the swami&#39;s assistant: &quot;If\n&gt; you don&#39;t give us an =\r\ninterview right away, we will show you the power of the\n&gt; media to destroy =\r\nyou.&quot; At one point a major TV station also wanted to drag\n&gt; in Ramakrishna =\r\nMission with similar allegations, but someone was able to\n&gt; stop that.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Failures of Swami Nithyananda&#39;s Organization\n&gt; \n&gt; Hindu tradition separate=\r\ns three kinds of Varna (skills), each representing a\n&gt; form of social capit=\r\nal, and these three were never supposed to be\n&gt; concentrated in a single pe=\r\nrson, thereby preventing too much concentration\n&gt; of power. I use the terms=\r\n Brahmin, Kshatriya and Vaishya not as birth based\n&gt; &quot;caste,&quot; but as merit =\r\nbased social capital and areas of competence. The\n&gt; Brahmin job description=\r\n focuses on spirituality and research; Kshatriya on\n&gt; governance, politics =\r\nand leadership; and Vaishyas on commerce and financial\n&gt; capital. Swami Nit=\r\nhyananda had persons with Brahmin qualities performing\n&gt; duties that demand=\r\n Kshatriya and Vaishya skills. This was counterproductive.\n&gt; The ashram lea=\r\nders were selected and trained for skills and roles that are\n&gt; very differe=\r\nnt than this situation demands. Too often their bhakti and\n&gt; spiritual prac=\r\ntice substituted for professional competence in managing a\n&gt; rapidly growin=\r\ng global enterprise. The sole emphasis was placed on\n&gt; traditional Brahmin =\r\nqualities, and none on what would be considered\n&gt; Kshatriya qualities.\n&gt; Fo=\r\nr example, there are a large number of white devotees who do have\n&gt; Kshatri=\r\nyata - leadership expertise, courage and commitment. But even after\n&gt; this =\r\nattack the ashram organization has blundered in its failure to leverage\n&gt; a=\r\nnd deploy them. I met some of these Westerners at the Kumbh and found them\n=\r\n&gt; remarkably willing to stand up for their guru, but nobody had bothered to=\r\n\n&gt; organize them and take advantage of the fact that Swami Nithyananda has =\r\na\n&gt; global following. Instead of such initiatives to deal with the crisis, =\r\nhis\n&gt; organization was in utter chaos, reacting to each &quot;hit&quot; by the other =\r\nside.\n&gt; Its leaders were running scared, driven by one rumor after another.=\r\n\n&gt; Decisions were being made in desperation and panic. The group was\n&gt; cogn=\r\nitively disoriented and many of its members were psychologically\n&gt; breaking=\r\n down.\n&gt; \n&gt; The organization was too much of a one-man show with the leader=\r\ns operating\n&gt; like children dependent on the swami for every decision. The =\r\nswami had\n&gt; become the iconic object of the ashram&#39;s inner circle. Their pr=\r\noximity to\n&gt; him became their measure of personal power and identity. This =\r\nis classical\n&gt; cult-like behavior that cannot survive the onslaughts that a=\r\nre inevitable\n&gt; nowadays. Such a concentration of all varnas into one man n=\r\not only makes an\n&gt; enterprise incompetent, but it also can also get to the =\r\nleader&#39;s head and\n&gt; make him power hungry. Especially when the guru has sid=\r\ndhis, this power can\n&gt; easily become co-opted by his ego into a dangerous m=\r\nixture. The result is\n&gt; that he surrounds himself with sycophants who tell =\r\nhim what he wants to\n&gt; hear, and this feedback loop of self glorification t=\r\nurns into group\n&gt; delusion.\n&gt; \n&gt; I noticed this in the form of the inner ci=\r\nrcle&#39;s inability to make common\n&gt; sense judgments, and their misrepresentin=\r\ng the facts to their leader by\n&gt; giving him too much &quot;good news.&quot; The resul=\r\nt was that the honest truth did\n&gt; not come out fast enough to allow pragmat=\r\nic and realistic planning. I had a\n&gt; difficult time to get dependable infor=\r\nmation, and the stories kept changing\n&gt; not only over time but also between=\r\n one person and another within the group.\n&gt; I could not tell if there was a=\r\n cover up and if new lies were fabricated to\n&gt; cover prior lies. In such an=\r\n atmosphere one cannot tell which individuals\n&gt; might have a separate stake=\r\n and vested interest from the group. Lacking\n&gt; competent Kshatriyas, the sw=\r\nami had not anticipated that such a crisis was\n&gt; ever possible, despite the=\r\n fact that outsiders (including myself in my 2-day\n&gt; talks at his ashram) h=\r\nad explained to them the threats facing every\n&gt; prominent Hindu mahatma tod=\r\nay.\n&gt; While on the one hand I blame those in positions of responsibility at=\r\n the\n&gt; ashram, ultimately Swami Nithyananda bears the responsibility as he =\r\nselected\n&gt; them, defined their roles, evaluated their performance, motivate=\r\nd and\n&gt; supervised them very closely. In this regard, his spiritual capabil=\r\nities had\n&gt; failed to evaluate those very close to him as well as the exter=\r\nnal reality.\n&gt; An enlightened master must do better than this, or else he m=\r\nust not try to\n&gt; control everything so personally.\n&gt; I acknowledge that bei=\r\nng a global guru is very demanding today, given that\n&gt; one has to represent=\r\n a very old tradition authentically and yet in a manner\n&gt; that appeals to m=\r\nodern people. This is why Hindu leaders need a crash course\n&gt; on matters th=\r\nat are well beyond the traditional education in their own\n&gt; sampradayas (li=\r\nneages).\n&gt; \n&gt; Hindu Chaos\n&gt; Swami Nithyananda&#39;s own support base in India h=\r\nas started to distance itself\n&gt; out of self preservation amidst all the rum=\r\nors and slander. His closest\n&gt; supporters were not approached soon enough w=\r\nith his side of the story, and\n&gt; by the time they were approached the damag=\r\ne to his credibility was already\n&gt; irreversible. They did not want to risk =\r\nbeing associated with a &quot;fallen\n&gt; guru.&quot; Many Hindu gurus have started to p=\r\nublicly lash out against the\n&gt; &quot;fallen godman&quot;; others became silent or neu=\r\ntral publicly, while offering\n&gt; private sympathy but refusing to stick thei=\r\nr necks out.\n&gt; \n&gt; One factor is that the swami&#39;s approach was too conservat=\r\nive for some and\n&gt; too liberal for others. It is too filled with deities, s=\r\nymbols and rituals\n&gt; of a very orthodox kind for the aesthetic taste of mod=\r\nern global gurus who\n&gt; propagate a whitened, Westernized &quot;clean&quot; Hinduism t=\r\nhat is abstract and\n&gt; metaphysical but devoid of imagery associated with &quot;p=\r\nrimitive paganism.&quot; At\n&gt; the other end of the spectrum are orthodox Hindu l=\r\neaders who find his idea\n&gt; of youthful dancing, celebration, and liberal at=\r\nmosphere to be not &quot;real&quot;\n&gt; Hinduism. A couple of shankaracharyas interview=\r\ned on NDTV lashed out against\n&gt; &quot;false&quot; gurus and claimed that only the sha=\r\nnkaracharyas had the authority to\n&gt; certify who was qualified to be a guru.=\r\n So Swami Nithyananda fits neither\n&gt; end of this spectrum.\n&gt; \n&gt; Many of the=\r\n gurus I met have told me in confidence that they fear that\n&gt; similar attac=\r\nks are coming to more Hindu gurus, but that there is no central\n&gt; Hindu mec=\r\nhanism to deal with these episodes along the lines of various\n&gt; Church mech=\r\nanisms that intervene when Christianity faces a scandal. I sent\n&gt; feelers t=\r\no the Hindu Dharma Acharya Sabha as to whether it should offer to\n&gt; step in=\r\n and take over the ashram and its related organizations, thereby\n&gt; bringing=\r\n new management to clean up matters and bring stability to the\n&gt; enterprise=\r\n. I was told that while this was a &quot;good idea in principle,&quot; it\n&gt; was not p=\r\nractical because HDAS is simply not set up to deal with this.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Way =\r\nForward\n&gt; My overriding concern throughout this investigation has been to f=\r\nind a way\n&gt; to do damage control in order to protect the broader interests =\r\nof dharma.\n&gt; This requires a pragmatic approach. Given the state of affairs=\r\n, it seems\n&gt; that the mess cannot be created without the swami leaving the =\r\nmovement and\n&gt; going into a strictly private life of meditation and self in=\r\nquiry. I worry\n&gt; for the young ashramites who I feel are amazing individual=\r\ns but in need of\n&gt; proper mentoring. They have a solid commitment to the ca=\r\nuse and their\n&gt; personal spiritual paths, but they lack the sophistication =\r\nand maturity to\n&gt; deal with what they face today.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Nithyananda sh=\r\nould resign immediately and hand over all his\n&gt; organizations to senior spi=\r\nritual masters, preferably Shaivites practicing\n&gt; the Shiva Sutras and rela=\r\nted traditions. He told me in an interview hat I\n&gt; recorded on March 9th th=\r\nat he was willing to leave everything and become a\n&gt; wandering sadhu again.=\r\n I wish that interview had been aired.\n&gt; \n&gt; The new spiritual leaders would=\r\n give the ashram a new life and chance to\n&gt; revive itself. It could either =\r\nremain a place for spiritual training or turn\n&gt; itself into a Hindu social =\r\nservice organization. Either way it would be a\n&gt; better outcome than the li=\r\nkely alternative of the government stepping in to\n&gt; take over the ashram an=\r\nd turn it over to administrators who are not\n&gt; positively disposed to Hindu=\r\n spirituality =96 as has happened in numerous\n&gt; similar cases of government=\r\n takeovers of Hindu temples and organizations\n&gt; despite government claims o=\r\nf its actions being &quot;secular&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Besides giving up the organization, Swa=\r\nmi Nithyananda should return to his\n&gt; personal sadhana under the guidance o=\r\nf these spiritual leaders. Let them\n&gt; evaluate him and his organization, an=\r\nd issue their independent report to the\n&gt; public. Swami Nithyananda should =\r\nfearlessly and humbly submit himself to\n&gt; their judgment of what happened a=\r\nnd what the remedies ought to be.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hinduism has survived for many mille=\r\nnnia and faced many kinds of crises,\n&gt; just like all the other major religi=\r\nons of the world. It has its own\n&gt; internal resources and mechanisms to dea=\r\nl with such situations. These need\n&gt; to be put to use and they need to beco=\r\nme modernized. This is not the last\n&gt; such scandal Hindu groups are going t=\r\no face in the near future.\n&gt; ---\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and=\r\n evil is bound to persist so long as\n&gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakris=\r\nhna Paramahamsa\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
