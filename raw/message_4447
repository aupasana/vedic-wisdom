He has a peaceful\ncountenance, he removes all ob=\r\nstacles in the way of those who meditate.=E2=80=99=E2=80=99\n\nThe following =\r\nyear the same scholar visited Arunachala during Kritikkai and\nrecited the o=\r\nne thousand slokas,entitled Sivasahasri, extolling the Deity.\nThe listeners=\r\n were very pleased with the scholarship and beautiful style of\nthe composit=\r\nion.\n\nEveryone wondered who that person of simple appearance but with profo=\r\nund\nscholarship was. They came to know that he was from Andhra and belonged=\r\n to\nKaluvarayi agraharam near Bobbili. His name was Kavya Kantha Ganapati\nS=\r\nastry. They expressed their appreciation of the gifted and blessed being of=\r\n\nrare talents.\n\nTruly Ganapati was a blessed child. In 1878 his father Nara=\r\nsimha Sastry was\nperforming japa at Kasi in front of Vinayaka=E2=80=99s ima=\r\nge. He suddenly felt that\na small boy was advancing towards him fromVinayak=\r\na. That was also the time\nwhen his baby son was born back home. The father =\r\nnamed the child Ganapati.\n\nTill he reached the age of five all kinds of ail=\r\nments including dumbness\ntroubled Ganapati. In his sixth year he was brande=\r\nd with a hot iron rod upon\nwhich all ailments left him. He was also able to=\r\n speak thereafter.\n\nHe then began his studies. Thereafter his life was mira=\r\nculous with\nunexcelled intellectual skills of great comprehension, phenomen=\r\nal memory and\namazing intuition.\n\nThere was nothing he could not understand=\r\n, nothing he could not commit to\nmemory after hearing once, no sastra that =\r\nwas not grist to his intellectual\nmill. By the time he was ten, he had memo=\r\nrized several kavyas. In Astrology\nhe was capable of drawing up a panchanga=\r\nm.He also had the capacity to\ncompose Sanskrit verses extempore. As he stud=\r\nied epics like the Ramayana and\nMahabharata two great ambitions arose in hi=\r\nm.\n\nOne was to become a great poet like Vyasa and Valmiki - and why not, he=\r\n\nthought, was he not already capable of composing poetry? The other ambitio=\r\nn\nwas this: in the puranas rishis like Viswamitra, and devotees like Dhruva=\r\n\nhad by the power of their japa become capable of creating a fresh world or=\r\n\nobtaining an abiding place in the firmament.Why not he also become one lik=\r\ne\nthem? With such great ambitions the lad continued his studies.\n\nBy the ti=\r\nme he was twelve, Ganapati composed a Sanskrit Kavya,\nBhringasandesa in the=\r\n mandakranta metre imitating the poet, Kalidasa. Within\na couple of years h=\r\ne was proficient in Chandas, Vyakarana, Kavyas, and\nPuranas. He was an exte=\r\nmpore poet, an ashtavadhani and an orator.\n\nIn 1900, while he was at Kasi h=\r\nis friends encouraged him to visit Nawadweepa\nto participate in the scholar=\r\ns=E2=80=99 meet held there. At that meet of great and\nreputed scholars, he =\r\ndemonstrated his unmatched literary gifts and talents.\nThus he earned the t=\r\nitle =E2=80=9CKavya Kantha,=E2=80=9D At that time, he was barely twenty\ntwo=\r\n.\n\nFor the fulfilment of his second ambition, Ganapati got initiated in sev=\r\neral\nmantras. Among these, his favourite was the Siva panchakshari. In orde=\r\nr to\nperform japa in the\nprescibed manner, he studied a number of agama sas=\r\ntras.He mastered all the\nspiritual literature in Sanskrit.\n\nHe got married =\r\nat the age of eighteen but with the permission of his father\nand wife he le=\r\nft on a pilgrimage to the banks of Ganga, Narmada and Godavari\nto perform j=\r\napa. He visited almost all the holy places of India twelve\ntimes, for perfo=\r\nrming japa. Though there were occasional spiritual\nexperiences he did not o=\r\nbtain the darshan of Siva, which he desired\nardently.\n\nAt Varanasi, the ple=\r\nased goddess gave him honey in a dream. At Nasik the\ntemple priest mistook =\r\nhim for a thief and the people of the place beat him\nup. In anger,he cursed=\r\n that the people of Nasik should also be hurt like\nhimself physically. With=\r\nin one month, an unprecedented cyclone struck the\ntown and hurt the people.=\r\n He had divine powers but they were of no avail to\nhimself!\n\nAs Ganapati Sa=\r\nstry was studying Vedic literature there arose before his\nmental eye the gl=\r\norious Aryan civilisation where people lived in harmony and\ndiscipline and =\r\nwere generally happy and peaceful. He compared it with the\nconditions obtai=\r\nning in the country in his own time where people were rigid\nand lifeless. T=\r\nhe people made themselves inflexible and bound themselves to\nvarious custom=\r\ns and above all, occupied the first place among the enslaved\nnations of the=\r\n world!\n\nHe then resolved that he should reform society and restore ancient=\r\n values.\nFor this, he decided to bring together and lead young men dedicate=\r\nd to\neradicating all the divisive forces in society and to performing mantr=\r\na japa\nas the rishis of ancient times did so that a new Aryan society could=\r\n be\nbuilt. In this endeavour, Ganapati thought, mantra japa was the key.\n\nG=\r\nanapati chanted the Sivapanchakshari a billion times; so also he wrote down=\r\n\nthe name of the Deity a billion times all of which had gone waste. In 1904=\r\n\nGanapati was appointed as a Telugu pandit at Vellore. He began taking\nprac=\r\ntical steps to realise his ideal and gathered a band of disciples round\nhim=\r\n. He spent his time in teaching than in imparting mantra japa to the\nstuden=\r\nts. He felt even that was not fruitful and decided to resume mantra\njapa at=\r\n Arunachala and reached that place in 1907.\n\nEven that was useless in that =\r\nin spite of all his learning he could not\ngrasp the implication of mantra j=\r\napa. He was sorry that years of japa did\nnot secure for him the darshan of =\r\nhis ishta devata.\n\nHe resolved to seek the Brahmanaswami=E2=80=99s refuge. =\r\nHe was not sure whether the\nSwami would still remember his interpretation o=\r\nf the sloka Suklambaradharam\nbut thought he would still seek the Swami=E2=\r\n=80=99s guidance. The Swami was his only\nsaviour, he concluded. Ganapati Sa=\r\nstry immediately set out for the hill in\nthe hot midday sun.\n\nBy the time t=\r\nhe emotion-charged Ganapati reached Virupaksha cave, the Swami\nwas sitting =\r\nalone on a rock.Ganapati prostrated before him and clasped his\nfeet with bo=\r\nth hands and in a choked voice said,\n\nI have studied all that has to be stu=\r\ndied. I have learnt Vedanta sastra\ncompletely. I have performed mantra-japa=\r\n to my heart=E2=80=99s content. But till now\nI have not been able to grasp =\r\nwhat tapas really means. I have now approached\nyou to know what it is. Plea=\r\nse enlighten me on the nature of tapas.\n\nThe Swami fixed his gaze on Ganapa=\r\nti for fifteen minutes. Ganapati was\nawaiting the reply anxiously. No one e=\r\nlse intruded and disturbed them. The\nSwami spoke in Tamil- =E2=80=9CIf you =\r\nenquire and observe where this I-thought\narises from, the mind gets absorbe=\r\nd in it. That is tapas.While performing\nmantra japa if you enquire and obse=\r\nrve where the sound of the mantra arises\nfrom, the mind gets absorbed in it=\r\n. That is tapas.=E2=80=9D\n\n\nGanapati Sastry stayed for some hours there and=\r\n after ascertaining the name\nof the Brahmama Swami he composed extempore fi=\r\nve slokas in praise of\n=E2=80=9CRamana=E2=80=9D.At that time Sastry was not=\r\n aware that Lakshmana Ayyar had referred\nto the boy Venkataraman as Ramana.=\r\n Ganapati was instrumental in reviving the\nname which had fallen into disus=\r\ne. The next day, Ganapati gave the upadesa\nto his disciples and told them t=\r\nhat it was given by Ramana.\n\nHe also enjoined on them to refer to the Swami=\r\n as Bhagavan Sri Ramana\nMaharshi. This name became world famous.\n\nIn the fi=\r\nrst three months of 1908 the Maharshi,Ganapati, and other disciples\nstayed =\r\nat the Pachaiamman Kovil at the foothill of Arunachala. Most of the\nexpense=\r\ns relating to the stay were borne by Ramaswamy Ayyangar,a devotee.\nDuring t=\r\nhat period, Ganapati, took to meditation as taught by Bhagavan. One\ndawn, a=\r\n brilliant light arose and touched the forehead of the Maharshi six\ntimes,G=\r\nanapati noticed this and also observed that the light got absorbed in\nthe a=\r\nura around the Maharshi=E2=80=99s head as six starlike formations.\n\nThough =\r\nhe practised the Maharshi=E2=80=99s way Ganapati=E2=80=99s original ideals =\r\ndid not\nleave him. Towards the end of March (1908) he wanted to leave Aruna=\r\nchala and\nasked the Maharshi whether the enquiry into the source of the =E2=\r\n=80=98Ithought=E2=80=99\nwould result in the fulfilment of his ideals or whe=\r\nther he had to do mantra\njapa also. The Maharshi replied that the former wa=\r\ns enough. Ganapati also\nasked the Maharshi whether his intention was good, =\r\nto which the latter\nreplied =E2=80=9CLeave everything to God, your burden w=\r\nill cease and He will take on\nyour burden. He knows what to do.=E2=80=9D\n\nM=\r\nuch later Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CWhile God sustains the burden of the worl=\r\nd, the\nspurious ego assumes its burden grimacing like an image on a tower s=\r\neeming\nto support it.=E2=80=9D\n\nReality in forty verses - Supplement verse =\r\n17\n=E2=80=93 Tr. K. Swaminathan\n\nKavya Kantha would visit Arunachala occasi=\r\nonally to have the darshan of\nBhagavan. Between 1922 and 1929 he stayed at =\r\nArunachala with his family.\nOnce, while at the mango tree cave the bones of=\r\n his skull loosened and he\nexperienced a softening of the area where the Br=\r\nahmarandhra exists.\n\nGanapati himself confessed that however much he tried =\r\nto follow the jnana\nmarga he had not been able to achieve abidance in the S=\r\nelf. In the first\nyears possibly the latent tendencies proved to be insurmo=\r\nuntable\nobstacles.Also, the activities of the sakti in the body were intens=\r\ne which\nit could not bear. On such occasions he would seek Bhagavan=E2=80=\r\n=99s help and get\nover that.\n\nGanapati Sastry used to say that sakti was of=\r\n two types- mahas and sahas of\nwhich the former was divine and that only wh=\r\nen sahas got transformed as\nmahas the bones of the skull loosend. Because o=\r\nf this sakti he could not\nbear to touch any metallic object and he always h=\r\nad to wear sandals made of\nwood. A number of his disciples also had experie=\r\nnced that sakti. Any copper\ncoin held in the palm became golden.\n\nBhagavan =\r\naddressed Ganapati as =E2=80=9CNayana=E2=80=9D as did the latter=E2=80=99s =\r\ndisciples.\nGanapati was a great man with extraordinary foresight, and power=\r\n of speech.\n\nOne may go to the extent of saying that he was a Vidyadhara in=\r\n human form.\nHis glory can be fully appreciated by going through Kapali Sas=\r\ntry=E2=80=99s Vasishta\nVaibhavam. But for his ideals and love of the countr=\r\ny which bound him,\nGanapati would have attained Self realisation.\n\nHe wrote=\r\n a lot of poetry in praise of Bhagavan, one of these poems, Sri\nRamana Chat=\r\nvarimsat was recited in Bhagavan=E2=80=99s presence every morning. It is\nst=\r\nill recited at Bhagavan=E2=80=99s shrine.\n\nIn order to realise his ambition=\r\ns Ganapati participated in politics and\nsocial reform activities till 1930.=\r\n Thereafter he gave them up and devoted\nhimself to tapas. He left his morta=\r\nl body on 25 July 1936 at Nimpura near\nKharagpur in his ashram.\n\nMore than =\r\nthe service he did for Bhagavan, Ganapati=E2=80=99s service to the nation\ni=\r\nn propagating Bhagavan=E2=80=99s message is greater. The answers Bhagavan g=\r\nave to\nthe questions of the disciples were incorporated as slokas in Sri Ra=\r\nmana\nGita composed by Ganapati Sastry. This book is an invaluable guide to =\r\nall.\nSimirarly, he translated into Sanskrit Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Ulladu Narpa=\r\ndu under the\ntitle Sat-darsanam.\n\nAs early as 1903 Ganapati Muni, through h=\r\nis foresight, recognised the\ngreatness of Bhagavan and spread the word. Und=\r\ner his guidance, his disciples\nPranavananda and Kapali Sastry wrote comment=\r\naries on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Upadesasaram\nand Sat-darsanam respectively. Kap=\r\nali Sastry also wrote an excellent\ncommentary on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Arunach=\r\nala Pancharatna. Ganapati=E2=80=99s disciples were\nall Bhagavan=E2=80=99s d=\r\nisciples too. They were spread all over the country and they\ncarried forwar=\r\nd Bhagavan=E2=80=99s message.\n\nSource: SRI RAMANA LEELA (A BIOGRAPHY OF BHA=\r\nGAVAN SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI)\nTelugu original Sri Krishna Bhikshu Edited and T=\r\nranslated by Pingali Surya\nSundaram\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =\r\n=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd7552082ce410488b81237\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;IT was 1903.

He had div=\r\nine powers but they were of no avail to himself!&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;As Ganapat=\r\ni Sastry was studying Vedic literature there arose before his mental eye th=\r\ne glorious Aryan civilisation where people lived in harmony and discipline =\r\nand were=C2=A0generally happy and peaceful. He compared it with the conditi=\r\nons obtaining in the country in his own time where people were rigid and li=\r\nfeless. The people made themselves inflexible and bound themselves to vario=\r\nus customs and above all, occupied the first place among the enslaved natio=\r\nns of the world!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;He then resolved=\r\n that he should reform society and restore ancient values. For this, he dec=\r\nided to bring together and lead young men dedicated to eradicating all the =\r\ndivisive forces in society and to performing mantra japa as the rishis of a=\r\nncient times did so that a new Aryan society could be built. In this endeav=\r\nour, Ganapati thought, mantra japa was the key.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Ganapati ch=\r\nanted the Sivapanchakshari a billion times; so also he wrote down the name =\r\nof the Deity a billion times all of which had gone waste.=C2=A0&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;In 1904 Ganapati was appointed as a Telugu pandit at =\r\nVellore.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0He began taking practical steps to realise his ideal a=\r\nnd gathered a band of disciples round him. He spent his time in teaching th=\r\nan in imparting mantra japa to the students. He felt even that was not frui=\r\ntful and decided to resume mantra japa at Arunachala and reached that place=\r\n in 1907.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Even that was useless i=\r\nn that in spite of all his learning he could not grasp the implication of m=\r\nantra japa.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0He was sorry that years of japa did not secure for =\r\nhim the darshan of his ishta devata.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;He resolved to seek the Brahm=\r\nanaswami=E2=80=99s refuge. He was not sure whether the Swami would still re=\r\nmember his interpretation of the sloka Suklambaradharam but thought=C2=A0he=\r\n would still seek the Swami=E2=80=99s guidance. The Swami was his only savi=\r\nour, he concluded. Ganapati Sastry immediately set out for the hill in the =\r\nhot midday sun.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;By the time the emotion-charged Ganapati reached V=\r\nirupaksha cave, the Swami was sitting alone on a rock.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-w=\r\neight:bold&quot;&gt;Ganapati prostrated before him and clasped his feet with both h=\r\nands and in a choked voice said,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:=\r\nitalic&quot;&gt;I have studied all that has to be studied. I have learnt Vedanta sa=\r\nstra completely. I have performed mantra-japa to my heart=E2=80=99s content=\r\n. But till now I have not been able to grasp what tapas really means. I hav=\r\ne now approached you to know what it is. Please enlighten me on the nature =\r\nof tapas.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;The Swami fixed his gaze on Ganapati for fifteen minutes=\r\n. Ganapati was awaiting the reply anxiously. No one else intruded and distu=\r\nrbed them. The Swami spoke in Tamil-=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;=\r\n=E2=80=9CIf you enquire and observe where this I-thought arises from, the m=\r\nind gets absorbed in it. That is tapas.While performing mantra japa if you =\r\nenquire and observe where the sound of the mantra arises from, the mind get=\r\ns absorbed in it. That is tapas.=E2=80=9D&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ganapa=\r\nti Sastry stayed for some hours there and after ascertaining the name of th=\r\ne Brahmama Swami he composed extempore five slokas in praise of =E2=80=9CRa=\r\nmana=E2=80=9D.At that time Sastry was not aware that Lakshmana Ayyar had re=\r\nferred to the boy Venkataraman as Ramana. Ganapati was instrumental in revi=\r\nving the name which had fallen into disuse. The next day, Ganapati gave the=\r\n upadesa to his disciples and told them that it was given by Ramana.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;He also enjoined on them to refer to th=\r\ne Swami as Bhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi. This name became world famous.&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;In the first three months of 1908 the Maharshi,Ganapati, and oth=\r\ner disciples stayed at the Pachaiamman Kovil at the foothill of Arunachala.=\r\n Most of the expenses relating to the stay were borne by Ramaswamy Ayyangar=\r\n,a devotee. During that period, Ganapati, took to meditation as taught by B=\r\nhagavan. One dawn, a brilliant light arose and touched the forehead of the =\r\nMaharshi six times,Ganapati noticed this and also observed that the light g=\r\not absorbed in the aura around the Maharshi=E2=80=99s head as six starlike =\r\nformations.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Though he practised t=\r\nhe Maharshi=E2=80=99s way Ganapati=E2=80=99s original ideals did not leave =\r\nhim. Towards the end of March (1908) he wanted to leave Arunachala and aske=\r\nd the Maharshi whether the enquiry into the source of the =E2=80=98Ithought=\r\n=E2=80=99 would result in the fulfilment of his ideals or whether he had to=\r\n do mantra japa also.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;The Mah=\r\narshi replied that the former was enough. Ganapati also asked the Maharshi =\r\nwhether his intention was good, to which the latter replied =E2=80=9CLeave =\r\neverything to God, your burden will cease and He will take on your burden. =\r\nHe knows what to do.=E2=80=9D&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Much later Bhagavan said, =E2=80=9CW=\r\nhile God sustains the burden of the world, the spurious ego assumes its bur=\r\nden grimacing like an image on a tower seeming to support it.=E2=80=9D&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Reality in forty verses - Supplement verse 17=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n=E2=80=93 Tr. K=\r\n. Swaminathan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Kavya Kantha would visit Arunachala occasionall=\r\ny to have the darshan of Bhagavan. Between 1922 and 1929 he stayed at Aruna=\r\nchala with his family. Once, while at the mango tree cave the bones of his =\r\nskull loosened and he experienced a softening of the area where the Brahmar=\r\nandhra exists.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Ganapati himself confessed that however much he tri=\r\ned to follow the jnana marga he had not been able to achieve abidance in th=\r\ne Self. In the first years possibly the=C2=A0latent tendencies proved to be=\r\n insurmountable obstacles.Also, the activities of the sakti in the body wer=\r\ne intense which it could not bear. On such occasions he would seek Bhagavan=\r\n=E2=80=99s help and get over that.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold=\r\n&quot;&gt;Ganapati Sastry used to say that sakti was of two types- mahas and sahas =\r\nof which the former was divine and that only when sahas got transformed as =\r\nmahas the bones of the skull loosend. Because of this sakti he could not be=\r\nar to touch any metallic object and he always had to wear sandals made of w=\r\nood. A number of his disciples also had experienced that sakti. Any copper =\r\ncoin held in the palm became golden.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan addressed Gan=\r\napati as =E2=80=9C&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Nayana&lt;/span&gt;=E2=80=9D a=\r\ns did the latter=E2=80=99s disciples. Ganapati was a great man with extraor=\r\ndinary foresight, and power of speech.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;One may go to the extent of s=\r\naying that he was a Vidyadhara in human form. His glory can be fully apprec=\r\niated by going through Kapali Sastry=E2=80=99s Vasishta Vaibhavam.=C2=A0&lt;sp=\r\nan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;But for his ideals and love of the country wh=\r\nich bound him, Ganapati would have attained Self realisation.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;He wrote a lot of poetry in praise of =\r\nBhagavan, one of these poems, Sri Ramana Chatvarimsat was recited in Bhagav=\r\nan=E2=80=99s presence every morning. It is still recited at Bhagavan=E2=80=\r\n=99s shrine.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;In order to r=\r\nealise his ambitions Ganapati participated in politics and social reform ac=\r\ntivities till 1930. Thereafter he gave them up and devoted himself to tapas=\r\n. He left his mortal body on 25 July 1936 at Nimpura near Kharagpur in his =\r\nashram.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;More than the service he did for Bhagavan, Ganapati=E2=80=\r\n=99s service to the nation in propagating Bhagavan=E2=80=99s message is gre=\r\nater. The answers Bhagavan gave to the questions of the disciples were inco=\r\nrporated as slokas in Sri Ramana Gita composed by Ganapati Sastry. This boo=\r\nk is an invaluable guide to all. Simirarly, he translated into Sanskrit Bha=\r\ngavan=E2=80=99s Ulladu Narpadu under the title Sat-darsanam.=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;As early as 1903 Ganapati Muni, through his foresight, recognised t=\r\nhe greatness of Bhagavan and spread the word. Under his guidance, his disci=\r\nples Pranavananda and Kapali Sastry wrote commentaries on Bhagavan=E2=80=99=\r\ns Upadesasaram and Sat-darsanam respectively. Kapali Sastry also wrote an e=\r\nxcellent commentary on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s Arunachala Pancharatna. Ganapati=\r\n=E2=80=99s disciples were all Bhagavan=E2=80=99s disciples too. They were s=\r\npread all over the country and they carried forward Bhagavan=E2=80=99s mess=\r\nage.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;: SRI RAMANA LE=\r\nELA (A BIOGRAPHY OF BHAGAVAN SRI RAMANA MAHARSHI) Telugu original Sri Krish=\r\nna Bhikshu Edited and Translated by Pingali Surya Sundaram&lt;div style=3D&quot;cle=\r\nar:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0p=\r\nx;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font=\r\n-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:=\r\n0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=\r\n=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=\r\n=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=\r\n=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd7552082ce410488b81237--\r\n\n"}}
