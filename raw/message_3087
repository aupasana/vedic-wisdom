I personally admire Shivaji, Maharana Pratap and Sardar Patel a=\r\nnd have placed them to the highest of my ideals. Sardar Patel is the one fo=\r\nr whom i have same love and respect as Thakur Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekanand=\r\na or Narasimha. Why? Because all the 3 were the ideal statesman who did us =\r\nproud not only by effectively countering religious fanaticism but also BECA=\r\nUSE THEY OPERATED IN THE SPIRIT OF &#39;SARVA DHARMA SAMABHAVA&#39;. BIGOTRY CAN NE=\r\nVER BE ATTACHED TO THEM. And for me this is fantastic and fitting to the id=\r\neals of Sanatan Dharma.\n\n***\nRegarding Dr. Zakir Naik: I did not know about=\r\n him initially. a year and half back, i visited Oman and there once i switc=\r\nhed on TV where in i saw that person on &#39;Peace&#39; Channel. He was lecturing i=\r\nn front of a gathering and he used a word &#39;Veda&#39; which interested me to go =\r\nthrough.\n\nI don&#39;t remember the topic but i felt so much saddened by his lec=\r\nture. The reason was that he kept on attacking Veda/Hinduism and Christiani=\r\nty for proving his points. Immediately in my mind came channels like &#39;Sansk=\r\naar&#39; and &#39;Ashta&#39; where a lot of religious pundits (most of them are Hindus)=\r\n  come for discourses. and i do not remember any instance where in they hav=\r\ne attacked any religious sentiments of other faiths to uphold values of San=\r\natan Dharma. there is such an obvious contrast.\nafter that first lecture, i=\r\n watched Zakir&#39;s other lectures and was convinced that this person is not a=\r\n true spiritual leader but a polished intellectual who essentially is a fan=\r\natic and then never stopped to see him further. I remember having a debate =\r\nat the same site (at Oman) with a Young person of Islamic faith. we debated=\r\n on the issue and i frankly asked him to send Mr. Naik, an email, asking hi=\r\nm that does he really believe that other religions and faith are also true.=\r\n I must say that, i found that young Muslim engineer had much more toleranc=\r\ne and understanding than Dr Zakir Naik.\nThe unfortunate part is that the br=\r\noad minded people of today&#39;s generations are getting corrupted by such fana=\r\ntic leaders.\n\n***\nAs i have many Muslim, Chrisitan Friends (Really good fri=\r\nends), i never loose a chance to advocate my views -&quot;The time has come when=\r\n we must not only &#39;respect&#39; the other religious faiths but also we must bel=\r\nive in our heart of hearts that every faith/religion is true and we must ne=\r\nver try to convert people of other religion to our religion but on the cont=\r\nrary we must discourage a person who wants to formally convert by telling h=\r\nim/her that yours is also right and don&#39;t get in to such theatrics.\n\nI abso=\r\nlutely echo Thakur Ramakrsihna- :&quot;as many are paths, as many opinion are th=\r\nere&quot;\n***\nAbout Sri Sri, i must say that i believe him as a great spiritual =\r\nleader. i&#39;ve some past experiences which makes me believe that. Now that is=\r\n the reason i wish to know his views on this particular debate episode. I k=\r\nnow he has a great knowledge and he also is a scholar but then why he did n=\r\not counter Dr. Zakir?. \n\nSiva wrote:\n[\nSome clues - AOL silver jubilee with=\r\n over 2 million people meditating and doing Sudarshan Kriya together happen=\r\ned around Feb 16, 2006.

It was something like: If Krishna were constrained to win all times, that=\r\n would be a limitation in itself! An Avatar chooses even defeat if it is ne=\r\ncessary for a larger and more complete victory in the scheme of the lela. Y=\r\nou ofcourse have to read the original to get his exact words.. I read it lo=\r\nng ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; Another instance that comes to mind - Some thieves came and be=\r\nat up Ramana Maharishi and made a big nuisance in his Ashram.

How is it that somebody like Sri S=\r\nri, who has commented exhaustively on several scriptures, who is an authori=\r\nty on vedanta both by his inner Realization and learning, who recited the B=\r\nhagavad Gita when he was 4 years old without anybody teaching him, and who =\r\ngives impromptu discourses in various forums across the world on all topics=\r\n under the sun shy away from explaining some simple questions that are abou=\r\nt his home turf?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The answer is that Sri Sri did not debate.

The topic of the meeting was some=\r\nthing like &quot;Concept of God in Hinduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO, Sri Sri did justic=\r\ne to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; an embodiment of the very thing that was supposed=\r\nly the topic of discussion. Those that were ready to benefit from it from t=\r\nhe audience would have benefited. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ************\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nhe below part is not for Rajarshi but may be of interest to everyone, espec=\r\nially those among us that are intellectually curious about spirituality tha=\r\nn practicing it. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Sri always practices &quot;experience first a=\r\nnd explanation and knowledge later&quot; principle. Sometimes in AOL, there will=\r\n be big congregation of thousands of people and Sri Sri will only say very =\r\nsimple things or share some simple jokes and laughs, but his presence would=\r\n convey what needs to be conveyed for those that are receptive. A Master ma=\r\ny not be interested in getting 100,000 people trading one mental concept fo=\r\nr another, but prefers one sincere person opening up to Truth in silence. A=\r\n Masters mere presence is enough for that to happen. Words are secondary an=\r\nd optional. In spiritual discussions,  the point of words is to create inne=\r\nr silence or illumination and if that is not created, there is no point in =\r\ntalking! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; It is a great privilege and an immense blessing to b=\r\ne in the presence of a living Master whether it is Sri Sri or someone else.=\r\n We gain immensely if we listen to them from our Being instead of our mind.=\r\n In Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s life, there are innumerable examples of very simple p=\r\neople benefiting from his mere looks & presence while big intellectuals wou=\r\nld debate with him and miss the opportunity of a lifetime. Sometimes when h=\r\ne countered insincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna would feign ignorance and sa=\r\ny what would I know - I am an illiterate! What a disaster it would have bee=\r\nn for a seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakrishna as an illiterate and ign=\r\noramus!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Without an accompanying experience (at least a small g=\r\nlimpse or even a fragment of an experience) accumulating knowledge can be v=\r\nery dangerous as it will become yet another mental concept and will actuall=\r\ny be a hindrance to the Sadhak. Some of the most subtle and dangerous hindr=\r\nances for a sadhak are created by none other than the sadhak&#39;s empty concep=\r\nts of spirituality and God!

I occasionally visit this forum. I happened to see several email=\r\ns about AOL and the below email from Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a follow=\r\ner of AOL&#39;s spiritual practices and as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ra=\r\nvishankar, I want to clarify a few things to the extent of my understanding=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several paths each leading to the destinat=\r\nion of Sat-Chit-Ananda. Some are ritualistic, some use austerities, some us=\r\ne devotion, etc. AOL is a path, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. T=\r\nhat does not make it in any way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Au=\r\nrobindo would call it, it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path one does not sud=\r\ndenly emerge into SatChitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is transform=\r\ned slowly and the sadhak radiates more and more as they progress more and m=\r\nore.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a seamless blend of Raja=\r\n yoga, Bhakti yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in AOL is =\r\nnot just doing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)understood. =\r\nPranayams and Sudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing and settling of the mi=\r\nnd and preparing for meditation and doing other spiritual practices of cont=\r\nemplation, Seva for rest of the day wit the right attitude. Regular practic=\r\ne of Sudarshan Kriya removes / breaks old patterns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n AOL includes some yoga asanas to prepare the body (the Padma Sadhana seque=\r\nnce of asanas taught in DSN course and Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar) tau=\r\nght in Part II or advance courses fall under this category.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The raja yoga practices include all the pranayams, Sudarshan Kriya, m=\r\nudras, bandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living course, advance courses=\r\n, Sahaj samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Knowledge =\r\npart includes deep contemplative study and imbibing of Narada Bhakti Sutras=\r\n, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat Gita. Sri Sri Ravisha=\r\nnkar has given very elaborate commentary on all of the above. His commentar=\r\ny on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and the publicly available commen=\r\ntary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes! Besides daily study o=\r\nf Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommended. Learning and contemplati=\r\non of this Wisdom is mandatory for those that strive to become Art of Livin=\r\ng teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The path of AOL emphasises on Surrender an=\r\nd Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama sankeertan and bhajans are a stan=\r\ndard feature of AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some wonder why AOL char=\r\nges for these courses and some wonder about lack of a Sadhguru at every sta=\r\nge.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me clarify from my personal experiences that S=\r\nri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened Master living in Sahaj Samadhi al=\r\nl times. He is capable of guiding millions of devotees in every step of the=\r\n sadhana without having to be near them in person. Several get necessary gu=\r\nidance in dreams (I myself had that experience twice), some in person and s=\r\neveral via various other ways. However, to get these guidance, an inner con=\r\nnection with the Master is essential. Until that stage, the various AOL cou=\r\nrses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborate and in-depth commentaries on various Knowledge ar=\r\ne more than enough to guide disciples to a stage where conscious inner comm=\r\nunion with Guru can be established.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several of the sen=\r\nior AOL teachers (mostly Swamis and Rishis) are yogis of a very high order =\r\ncapable of reaching SatChitAnanda consciousness at will during meditation. =\r\nThey may be not fully established in it like Sri Sri, but act as channels o=\r\nf the SatGuru and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and when needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is very easy to accept those that left their body as havi=\r\nng achieved highest realization such as Sri Aurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or=\r\n Ramana Maharishi. However it is a human tendency to doubt them when they a=\r\nre in physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging money for =\r\nits courses: AOL is world&#39;s largest volunteer run organization. Neither AOL=\r\n teachers nor its founder Sri Sri Ravishankar make monitory profits. All th=\r\ne proceeds go to the charitable activities again run by volunteers. Many of=\r\n the full time teachers have given up veyr lucrative careers and millions w=\r\north in property to become teachers and teach for free. Sri Sri Ravishankar=\r\n neither needs all the money. All senior AOL teachers including Sri Sri hav=\r\ne went through very bad and sometimes even dangerous conditions to bring th=\r\ne Knowledge to the masses. This is a time when the highest Knowledge needs =\r\nto be revealed to maximum number of people.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Senior AOL=\r\n teachers have faced danger to their lives by going without any help or gui=\r\ndance to areas infested with naxalites, terrorists in North East, Kashmir, =\r\nIraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. with nothing but love and Divine =\r\nGrace as their aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As far as I know, money is charged=\r\n in AOL courses for two reasons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) Past experience sh=\r\nowed that those that paid for the courses seem to follow the practices more=\r\n diligently. It is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no deserving person should be de=\r\nnied a course because they cannot afford to pay. As a volunteer, I was part=\r\n of organizing several AOL courses and know first hand many cases where peo=\r\nple took courses for free and were also provided free accommodation, etc. W=\r\nhenever natural disaster strikes, AOL teachers go there paying from their o=\r\nwn pocket or by AOL and teach courses for free and provide healing to the v=\r\nictims. AOL does not advertise it or make a show of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; 2) This is my understanding and not AOl position. It removes the Karmic d=\r\nebt to the AOL teachers and volunteers who still may have some doership in =\r\nthem.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, Sri Sri is only interested in getting e=\r\nveryone turn inwards and express the love, joy and compassion that is insid=\r\ne everyone. As long as one follows a path, any path and surrenders to any S=\r\nat Guru, we are happy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Siva.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
