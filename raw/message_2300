I heard the news at home only, because women cannot be in\n=\r\nthe Ashram in the nights. I went at 7-30 next morning. A prayer was being\nb=\r\nroadcast over the radio. The news of the death was in the newspapers, and\nB=\r\nhagavan reading it and hearing the prayer,said, =93This is the prayer of\npe=\r\nople who prayed like that throughout his life.=94 The song =93Vaishnava\nJan=\r\nato=94 was broadcast over the radio and Bhagavan listened to it sadly. At\n9=\r\n-45, Bhagavan was about to go out when a newspaper reporter came and\nreques=\r\nted him to give his views on the tragedy so that they might be\npublished.Bh=\r\nagavan, his voice choked with emotion, said, =93For the Mahatma=92s\ndeath i=\r\nn this tragic manner, every person=92s heart is mourning. What is there\nin =\r\nparticular that I could say? Who is there who is not grieved? If I say\nanyt=\r\nhing, you will publish it and then, one after another, people will come\nand=\r\n ask me. What is the good of it?=94\n\nSo saying, Bhagavan sent the reporter =\r\naway and went for his walk. On his\nreturn, =93Vaishnava Janato=94 was again=\r\n being broadcast and tears fell from\nBhagavan=92s eyes.At 4-30 that afterno=\r\non, all the ladies began to sing\n=93Raghupati Raghava Rajaram=94.With tears=\r\n in his eyes Bhagavan signed to us to\ncontinue. At 5 o=92clock the conch sh=\r\nell blew and in view of the Mahatma=92s\ndeath a special arati (waving of li=\r\nghts) was offered in the Mother=92s temple.\nWhen the sacred ash and vermili=\r\non powder were brought,Bhagavan took them\nwith great reverence.\n\nThe day be=\r\nfore yesterday, while reading the paper,Bhagavan remarked to\nsomeone sittin=\r\ng near him, =93Look, didn=92t a comet appear some time ago? It is\nwritten i=\r\nn this paper that the death of the Mahatma was due to that. So the\nfirst re=\r\nsult of it is now over.=94\n\nWhat exactly was in Bhagavan=92s mind when he s=\r\naid that? Meanwhile, he took up\nanother paper and on reading it,said, =93Th=\r\ne person who fired the shot, it\nseems, came up to the Mahatma and, after bo=\r\nwing down, asked him, =91Why have\nyou come so late today, Sir?=92 The Mahat=\r\nma replied that it was due to some\nwork. The shot was fired immediately aft=\r\ner.=94 Bhagavan then drew a parallel\nfrom the Ramayana, saying,=93It seems =\r\nthat after Rama killed Ravana, he forgot\nthat he,Rama, had to go to Vaikunt=\r\nha. So the Devatas took counsel among\nthemselves and then sent Yama, the Go=\r\nd of Death,to him. Yama came in the\ngarb of an ascetic, and respectfully sa=\r\nid, =91The work for which you have come\nis now over; please come to heaven=\r\n=92. This is similar; =91Swaraj has been\nobtained; your work is over; why a=\r\nre you still here? Shouldn=92t you go back?\nIt is already late=92. Thus the=\r\n Mahatma appears to have been sent away.=94\n\nI asked, =93The story you have=\r\n just told us is from the Uttara Ramayana, is it\nnot?=94\n\nBhagavan: =93Yes,=\r\n but not only there. It has been written in another book\nthat, in the case =\r\nof Krishna, the arrow of Vyadha was the cause of His\ndeath; similarly it ha=\r\nppened with the Mahatma.=94\n\nYesterday, Harindranath Chattopadhyaya showed =\r\na photo of Mahatma, and said,\n=93It is a pity that there was never any meet=\r\ning between Gandhi and Bhagavan.=94\n\nBhagavan: =93Some time ago, he came to=\r\n Tiruvannamalai.A meeting had been\narranged for him to be held on the road =\r\naround the hill, beyond the Ashram.\nPeople here thought that he would come =\r\nto the Ashram on his way back, but\nowing to the pressure of the crowds it w=\r\nas impossible, and he went away\ndirect to the station. It seems that he ver=\r\ny much regretted this\nafterwards. Shankarlal Banker was very keen on bringi=\r\nng him here, and in\n1938, when Rajendra Prasad and Jamnalal Bajaj came here=\r\n and saw\nSkandasramam, they wanted to induce the Mahatma to stay there for =\r\nsome\ntime.But it did not happen. If at Sabarmati, or at Wardha anyone said =\r\nthat\nhe was mentally depressed, the Mahatma used to say, =91Go to Ramanasra=\r\nmam and\ncome back after a month=92s stay there=92.When Ramaswami Reddiar we=\r\nnt to see the\nMahatma immediately after taking office as Chief Minister, Ma=\r\ndras State,the\nMahatma, it seems, asked him for how long he had been going =\r\nto the\nRamanasramam. When he answered that he had been going there for over=\r\n thirty\nyears, the Mahatma said, =91Is that so? I have tried thrice, but so=\r\n far have\nnot been able to go there=92. What could he do? How could he come=\r\n here when he\nwas not left alone for one moment?=94\n\nBhagavan read in today=\r\n=92s paper a report to the effect that the Mahatma had\nhad from a dream the=\r\n night before the tragedy, a premonition of his death,\nand that therefore,h=\r\ne had quickly disposed of his papers which had caused\nthe delay in his comi=\r\nng to the prayer. Bhagavan commented, =93Yes. For\nenlightened people, will =\r\nthere not be that much of premonition? They will\nknow, but will not tell ot=\r\nhers.=94\n\nSource: Letters from and Recollections of Sri Ramanasramam Book\n\n=\r\n-- \nLove And Love Alone\n\nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Ramanaya\nPrasanth Jalasutram=\r\n\n\r\n--00c09ffb4c71c721da04718d8dd5\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;color: rgb(51, 51, 51); font-fami=\r\nly: Verdana; &quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;post-body entry-content&quot; style=3D&quot;margin-top: =\r\n0px; margin-right: 0px; margin-bottom: 0.75em; margin-left: 0px; line-heigh=\r\nt: 1.3em; &quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold; &quot;&gt;On the night of January 30=\r\nth, the news of Mahatma Gandhi=92s death became known everywhere.&lt;/span&gt;=A0=\r\nI heard the news at home only, because women cannot be in the Ashram in the=\r\n nights.
