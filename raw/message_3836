In this case you may end up using all in a=\r\nll 2 to 3 coconut halves. Checkout!\n\nOnce Manish suggested me to burn as mu=\r\nch day coconuts as possible and suggested to offer Supari as Poornaahuti. J=\r\nust for Informations of all members of the list.\nInitially Supari was remai=\r\nning half burnt most of the times. Then after a few days, one idea clicked.=\r\n I started keeping Supari (Supari used in Pujan i.e. smaller in size) in a =\r\nDray coconut half and started offering that as Poornaahuti. Thence on, Supa=\r\nri and everything else in Homa Kundam is getting completely burnt (which is=\r\n a preliminary requirement for all the homas that all the offerings should =\r\nget burnt completely).\n\n***\nFor Brahmacharya, if i may suggest, keep a vow =\r\nfor some time period. Say 12 days or 40 days or 108 days or such duration w=\r\nhich you can sustain. A resolve (vow) helps in strengthening the will power=\r\n. Initial failures are inevitable for most so do not worry and start again =\r\nand again and again..... Eat less during Dinner. Let the stomach be filled =\r\nonly 3/4th. That should also help a lot. Prayer to chosen god is almost ind=\r\nispensable in the case of Brahmacharya.\n\nBest wishes!\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;biswa108&quot; &lt;biswa1975@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; NAMASKAR to =\r\nall\n&gt; \n&gt; I have been performing Ganapati Homama for the last three weeks, c=\r\nredit goes to all of my seniors/members and Gurus of this beautiful forum..=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now I need some practical approach best suitable for me...\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. S=\r\nuggested / Suitable time to perform ganapati homam(currently, I am performi=\r\nng around the time of sunrise, is it suitable at night or before sunrise to=\r\no?)\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. What substance should not be offered in Ganapati homam (bel-lea=\r\nves should be one in the list, I unknowingly used it and experience very ba=\r\nd effects!) \n&gt; \n&gt; 3. When the talking of &quot;AGHORA&quot; going on, is it really ne=\r\neded to perform &quot;Bramhachariya&quot; for daily ganapati homam? if someone can co=\r\nntrol his/her thinkings during ganapati homam, sex/masturbating/consume non=\r\n-veg food is really needed? (In my practical experience, consume very low-d=\r\niet little food at last night are excellent for performing Ganapati Homama =\r\nin the morning. my point is, readying our body/mind 5-6 hours before the ho=\r\nmama procedure by controlling sex/food are very much useful for me!)\n&gt; \n&gt; 4=\r\n. Is there any practical methods to keep the fire more times in the homam k=\r\nundam so that more time to spend on meditation?\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. Is there any cost e=\r\nffective solutions for daily homam in Kolkata, India? Sometimes I find expe=\r\nnsive for daily ganapati homam. We may ask to create a group in Kolkata to =\r\nuse our cumulative purchasing capacity for cheap rate. \n&gt; \n&gt; best regards,\n=\r\n&gt; Biswajit\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
