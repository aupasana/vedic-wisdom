If ten \npeople read nine times each, the count is 10x9=90.\n\nWhen we did Sata Chandi homam, we did it that way. Actually, we did not do \nover ten days. It was 7 days. We cumulatively chanted 90 times in 4 days and \nthen chanted 10 times *in the fire* over the final 3 days.\n\nThe priest arranged for some other priests to read Chandipath during those 4 \ndays and clear the count of 90 with a safe margin. But not all of them were \nreading it at the temple. They were reading it at their homes with the \nmental sankalpam to contribute to the homam at the temple.\n\nThe homam was due to the sankalpam of my spiritual master Dr Manish Pandit \nfrom Manchester, UK. He suggested that we should actually get to the count \nof 90 *at* the temple if possible. So some of us chanted several times a day \nand actually covered the count of 90 at the temple itself with a margin. In \naddition, some more people read it at homes, based on the previous plan of \nthe priest. So we made the count in different ways.\n\nI was not there all the 7 days. During the first 4 days, I was away for 2 \ndays, visiting Tirupati, Tirunannamalai, Kanchi etc. But my guru was there \nchanting all the seven days. On 5 out of 7 days, I too was there at the \ntemple. However, we left the temple and went to the house of the head priest \nto sleep in the nights. It may have been a good idea to sleep at the temple \nitself. Again, it is a very alive temple with so many kinds of energies...\n\nYes, we think we are the doers, but we are just pawns. Just read the \nkavacha, argala and keela in the beginning of chandipath on each day for \nprotection.\n\nI took a vow at the Sata Chandi homam to read Chandipath for 108 consecutive \ndays and completed it in June 2006. A couple of months after that, the head \npriest of that Kalikambal temple visited Boston. He was at our house and we \ndid 10 Chandi homas at my house. We did 8 on a Saturday (starting in the \nmorning and going on till 2 am!), the 9th on Sunday morning and did an \nelaborate final one on Sunday afternoon. It was six months after the Sata \nChandi homam in Chennai and it can also be considered a different kind of \nSata Chandi homam.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Swadhin&quot; &lt;beherajapan@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, March 16, 2007 3:51 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] need some calrifications about chandi-path ; to \nNarasimha ji\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha ji\n&gt;\n&gt; I have a few questions regarding the chandi path and I hope you can\n&gt; help me with your knowledge as you have much experience in this.\n&gt;\n&gt; How do you do certain number of chandi paths? Does one person reads\n&gt; the book continuously until the number of pathas is completed?\n&gt;\n&gt; I was wondering if it is OK to do simultaneous paths by say 7 people\n&gt; to complete sapta chandi path? If that is possible then sata chandi\n&gt; path can be completed even in one day. But I remember you did that in\n&gt; Chennai over a period of 10 days or so. In this case did the person\n&gt; (I think you) who took the sankalp to complete the sata chandi path\n&gt; stayed in the temple from start to end?\n&gt;\n&gt; I understand from my experience that without mother&#39;s wish such a\n&gt; thing is not possible but do people invoke mother&#39;s protection in\n&gt; some way besides choosing an auspicious time (as you did)\n&gt;\n&gt; Thanks and with my best regards\n&gt; Swadhin\n\n\n\n"}}
