I have browsed several posts here and I do not=\r\n know of any \n&gt; &gt; reference in any traditional shastras, so I have a questi=\r\non regarding the \n&gt; &gt; performance of homam in one&#39;s mind. There must be tim=\r\nes in one&#39;s life when \n&gt; &gt; several restrictions of time or place or any oth=\r\ner reasons - do not allow one to \n&gt; &gt; perform an external homam under the &quot;=\r\nperfect&quot; conditions that one would like. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. So how does one =\r\ngo about this? Does one mentally visualize oneself performing \n&gt; &gt; all the =\r\nexternal rituals from A-Z? What if one&#39;s mind cannot &quot;multi-task&quot; and \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nsynchronize the mental recitation of mantras with the mental performance of=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; actions? What if one cannot maintain the same standards of external e=\r\nnvironment \n&gt; &gt; purity, discipline etc? Is it then best to avoid mental hom=\r\nam altogether?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. Can one derive the same benefit from a mental ho=\r\nmam that one would derive \n&gt; &gt; from an external homam?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. Could a =\r\nregular performance of mental homam remove the impediments that is \n&gt; &gt; blo=\r\ncking one in doing homam in real life and may it result in one becoming \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; fortunate enough to carry out real-life homam by the grace of God?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Many many Thanks\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
