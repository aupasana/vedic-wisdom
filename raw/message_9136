These constitute your real nature. These constitute the higher spiritua=\r\nl part of you. Have, therefore, compassionate regard for your kith and kin,=\r\n parents and children, brothers and sisters, friends and neighbours.&quot;\n\n&quot;Wit=\r\nhout this practice in your life, spiritual blessedness cannot come.&quot;\n\n2Hars=\r\nh speech, a sharp tongue, flashes of anger and annoyance that wound the fee=\r\nlings of others should never be allowed. Happiness comes by increasing the =\r\njoy in the lives of others. It comes to those who are centres of love, cent=\r\nres of kindness and compassion, and who never entertain even remotely the t=\r\nhought of hurting the least of God&#39;s creatures.&quot; \n\n&quot;My Master says in a hum=\r\norous way, &quot;Amidst all the uncertainties and insecurities of this world one=\r\n thing alone is certain=97you have to pass. You cannot remain here. This is=\r\n only a drama you are enacting. You have come from an unmanifest state into=\r\n an embodied, manifest state. Every second shortens the period allotted to =\r\nyou here. What that period is, no one knows. Every birthday which you celeb=\r\nrate with so much happiness, with birthday cards, cakes and candles, takes =\r\none year away from the period allotted to you. Soon the allotted period has=\r\n to come to an end. Once again you will have to go back into that unmanifes=\r\nt state where you will be disembodied, where you will have no personality, =\r\nno name. You have to pass&quot;.&quot;\n\n&quot;Life is very precious. Say, &quot;I have come her=\r\ne to realize the supreme state of blessedness and to experience the highest=\r\n bliss. I have been given this unique opportunity of a human birth and a hu=\r\nman life in order to attain that Ultimate Goal&quot;.&quot; \n\n&quot;The chance is now give=\r\nn. Who knows if the keen state of aspiration and receptivity to the highest=\r\n principle will last? Who knows if the keen state of devotion to the ideal =\r\nwill continue? Therefore, now is the time to make a supreme effort to reali=\r\nze the true purpose of life. Now is the time to make an earnest effort to a=\r\nttain the highest blessedness and the wondrous bliss of Realization.&quot;\n\nThe =\r\nfull book is available here \n\nhttp://www.energyenhancement.org/sivananda/Sr=\r\ni-Swami-Sivananda-The-Path-Beyond-Sorrow-Chapter-6-Your-True-Purpose-In-Lif=\r\ne-6-Practice-of-Virtues.html\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
