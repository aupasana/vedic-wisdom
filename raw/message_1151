Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In my judgment, a rudraksha mala is more than \n=\r\n&gt; enough for Ganesha sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For Lakshmi, kamalagutta mala (a gar=\r\nland of lotus \n&gt; seeds) is considered the \n&gt; &gt; best. I did use one that was=\r\n gifted by the same \n&gt; priest who gifted me so many \n&gt; &gt; other religious ar=\r\nticles. However, in my judgment, \n&gt; I had more fruitful \n&gt; &gt; sessions of Ma=\r\nhalakshmi meditation with \n&gt; Rudraksha mala than with it. \n&gt; &gt; Rudraksha an=\r\nd Tulasi are very special compared \n&gt; to all other malas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Instead =\r\nof using a different mala for each deity, it \n&gt; is a good idea to use a \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; single mala for all meditation and let it be a \n&gt; repository of all the \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; generated energy.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This reminds me=\r\n of an unrelated incident. When \n&gt; Shata Chandi homam conducted \n&gt; &gt; in Che=\r\nnnai in March 2006 was finished, priests \n&gt; bathed the idols in the \n&gt; &gt; ga=\r\nrbhaalaya with the water from the kalashas \n&gt; (pots) used in the homas and =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; brought malas from the idol and gave them to us. \n&gt; The priest put a R=\r\nudraksha \n&gt; &gt; mala from the Mother around my neck. A passing \n&gt; thought cam=\r\ne to me and got \n&gt; &gt; stuck in my mind for a couple of seconds, &quot;I \n&gt; alread=\r\ny have so many rudraksha \n&gt; &gt; malas, but I have no sphatika mala, which is =\r\n\n&gt; considered ideal for the \n&gt; &gt; Mother. I just took a vow of doing Chandip=\r\nath for \n&gt; 108 days. I wish he had \n&gt; &gt; given me a sphatika mala instead of=\r\n this \n&gt; rudraksha mala.&quot; Then I forgot \n&gt; &gt; about that stupid thought.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; This was in the afternoon. Next morning, we were \n&gt; in a flight from =\r\nChennai to \n&gt; &gt; Hyderabad. In another day, I was to leave for \n&gt; Boston. In=\r\n the flight to\n&gt; &gt; Hyderabad, my son was kicking the seat in front of \n&gt; hi=\r\nm and the gentleman \n&gt; &gt; turned back to complain. I apologized and told my =\r\n\n&gt; son to behave. The \n&gt; &gt; gentleman turned forward and again turned back \n=\r\n&gt; in a few seconds and asked \n&gt; &gt; &quot;you are PVR Narasimha Rao, right?&quot; I sai=\r\nd yes. \n&gt; He apparently uses my free \n&gt; &gt; Jyotish software and likes me. Th=\r\nough I had \n&gt; offered all my hair to Balaji at \n&gt; &gt; Thirumala a few days ba=\r\nck and was without any \n&gt; hair, he still identified me \n&gt; &gt; based on a phot=\r\no published 6 years back in an \n&gt; interview in a Jyotish \n&gt; &gt; magazine! He =\r\ntalked to me for a while.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When we reached Hyderabad, he ran to the=\r\n \n&gt; baggage claim, collected his \n&gt; &gt; suitcase, took out a sphatika mala fr=\r\nom it and \n&gt; gifted it to me. He said he \n&gt; &gt; met a saint on the previous a=\r\nfternoon at Chennai \n&gt; and the saint gave him \n&gt; &gt; three sphatika malas - o=\r\nne for him, one for a \n&gt; family member and the third \n&gt; &gt; one meant for som=\r\neone else. The saint told him \n&gt; that he would meet somebody \n&gt; &gt; he respec=\r\nted on the next day and he was \n&gt; supposed to hand over the mala to \n&gt; &gt; th=\r\nat person. When he saw me, he decided that the \n&gt; mala was meant for me. \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Interestingly, his meeting with the saint happened \n&gt; around the same ti=\r\nme I \n&gt; &gt; had that stupid thought about sphatika mala in the \n&gt; garbhalaya =\r\nof the temple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; During shata Chandi homam, I took a vow to read \n&gt; =\r\nChandipath for 108 \n&gt; &gt; consecutive days. I did it and used that mala to \n&gt;=\r\n count the moola mantra. At \n&gt; &gt; the end, that priest came to Boston and co=\r\nnducted \n&gt; 10 Chandi homas at our \n&gt; &gt; house to complete the sadhana. Durin=\r\ng the last \n&gt; homam, a strong thought came \n&gt; &gt; to my mind, &quot;the purpose fo=\r\nr which that sphatika \n&gt; mala was sent is over. Now \n&gt; &gt; offer it back to t=\r\nhe Mother in fire.&quot; I suppressed \n&gt; my instincts and did not \n&gt; &gt; do it. I =\r\nwanted to hang on to it. See, I formed an \n&gt; attachment with it! \n&gt; &gt; Inter=\r\nestingly, that mala broke on the same \n&gt; evening, a little after that \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhomam was finished! Of course, I made a mala \n&gt; again with the sphatikas an=\r\nd \n&gt; &gt; kept it for offering it in fire next time. Now I \n&gt; realized that my=\r\n attachment \n&gt; &gt; was foolish.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Of course, I did Chandipath and Chan=\r\ndi homam \n&gt; many more times after that, but \n&gt; &gt; that was the first 108 and=\r\n I was destined to use \n&gt; the mala given by that \n&gt; &gt; saint for that round.=\r\n Now, of course, I use the \n&gt; same rudraksha mala for \n&gt; &gt; everything and d=\r\nid not look for another sphatika \n&gt; mala.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; It is the nature of mind to see variety. There are \n&gt; different types =\r\nof malas \n&gt; &gt; and different kinds of rituals and mind is \n&gt; fascinated by t=\r\nhe variety. At the \n&gt; &gt; end, mind needs to be trained to see the same in \n&gt;=\r\n the variety. But, in the \n&gt; &gt; beginning, mind does see variety and it need=\r\ns to \n&gt; wade through variety...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; -----\n&gt; &gt; Do =\r\na Short Homam Yourself: \n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitr=\r\ni Tarpanas Yourself: \n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-\n&gt; wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lesson=\r\ns (MP3): \n&gt; http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (W=\r\nindows): \n&gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: \n&gt; http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\n&gt; ----- \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----=\r\n- \n&gt; &gt; From: &quot;sbm_sharma&quot; &lt;sbm_sharma@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Friday, February 06, 2009 3:27 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom]=\r\n Mala For Ganesha\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste. I would l=\r\nike to ask you yet another\n&gt; &gt; &gt; question.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Which mala is best f=\r\nor Ganesha Japa? I know \n&gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; say to stick with one mala for all Jap=\r\na however \n&gt; my\n&gt; &gt; &gt; mind cannot fully accept this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Which mala=\r\n is best for Ganesha? Sandalwood,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Turmeric or Sphatik? Or something\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; else entirely? Thank you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\nNamaste Sir......=\r\n.....\n\nI too have the same type of confusion as you regarding malas, etc\nan=\r\nd as I have some familiarity with jyotish I have extendend my \nmadness to p=\r\nicking the absolutely perfect muhurta for performing my \nirregularly schedu=\r\nled homa.  You see I want spiritual growth and I \nwant to &#39;get something&#39; o=\r\nut of it as well, and subsequently the homas \nwhere I was very attached to =\r\ngetting something were tinged with my \ndesire and the quality of my concent=\r\nration suffered. The same with \nthe malas, I think that some &#39;thing&#39; is goi=\r\nng to ensure my success in \na sadhana when actually my willingness to drop =\r\nthe attachment and the \nconfusion that always seems to attend my selfish de=\r\nsires, and focus \non the sadhana itself is the key.\n\nI know you had asked N=\r\narasimha, but I felt a certain kinship with \nyour dilema.\n\nBest Regards....=\r\n........Ajaya \n\n\n"}}
