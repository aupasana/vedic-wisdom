To get stuck up in family, children and=\r\n relatives is not the ideal of courageous and discriminative women. Every m=\r\nother of the world should realize her responsibility to awaken herself and =\r\nher children, her family, her husband, to the true light and splendor of sp=\r\niritual life. What a glorious mother was Madalasa! Did she ask her children=\r\n to study up to the post-graduate examination and then seek for some employ=\r\nment? Suddhosi Buddhosi, Niranjanosi, Samsara-Maya-Parivarjitosi=E2=80&quot;=E2=\r\n=80=9CYou are pure, you are consciousness, you are taintless, you are devoi=\r\nd of the maya of samsara.=E2=80=9D Such was the advaitic instruction which =\r\nMadalasa gave to her children when she rocked them in the cradle. How many =\r\nmothers of the present-day world have got the fortune to teach their childr=\r\nen such a profound knowledge? On the other hand, the present day mothers wo=\r\nuld try to crush the spiritual tendency of their children even if it is fou=\r\nnd in them in a microscopic state! What a sad and pitiable condition of the=\r\nse ignorant mothers! Wake up, O mothers, sisters! Wake up from your deep sl=\r\neep! Recognize your responsibility! Spiritualize yourselves! Spiritualize y=\r\nour children! Spiritualize even your husbands, for you are the makers of th=\r\ne family! Remember how Chudala illumined her husband. You are the makers of=\r\n the nations! You are the builders of the world! Therefore spiritualize you=\r\nrselves! Assert in yourselves the spirit of Sulabha, Maitreyi, Gargi, Gauri=\r\n-Puri-Devi! Do not be cowardly! Come out of your fleshy homes, the homes of=\r\n delusion, the homes of vanity! \n\n\n"}}
