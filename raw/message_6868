There is hardly any smoke with proper use of ghee (you will know =\r\nthe ratio when you do it).\n\n2. If you can manage fire alarm inside apart or=\r\n have a balcony then you should definetly do homam.\n\n3. The simple procedur=\r\ne at the end of homam manual is the best to start with. so dotn wait for an=\r\nything just start with Ganapati homam. Homam is extremely powerful. Do what=\r\never you can to start with ganapati homam. You are welcome to ask more ques=\r\ntion in this forum.\n\n4. If not possible daily you can do weekly homam but d=\r\no regular sadhana. Pick any mantra/strotra of your favorite Diety and chant=\r\n it for 1 hr with full devotion and sincerity.\n\n5. For non homam sadhana - =\r\nI suggest start with ganapati mool mantra for atleast 444 times (around 45m=\r\nin) for 40days and see the result yourself.\n\nregards\npriyank\n\n\n\n\n--- In ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;pramod_ku_singh&quot; &lt;pramod.dynamic@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; Even I am studying in USA and would like to do Homa.

I=\r\n am wondering if the smoke would raise the fire alarm etc. In summer, thoug=\r\nh it is terribly hot here, I can still afford to open the windows. In winte=\r\nr this is next to impossible. I am not worried abt my home catching fire, b=\r\nut I am worried abt the fire safety alarm. The leasing office levies hefty =\r\nfines for violating fire safety rules.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2 Do you know any place in =\r\nUS where I can find a small homa kunda and other necessary items? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n shubham bhavatu\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ramnath\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
