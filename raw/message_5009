It is v=\r\nery tough to convey sophisticated philosophy using words.\n \nAll pervading s=\r\nhakti works through all of us and expresses through all of our desires, act=\r\nions and knowledge. But then, some universal rules of action and reaction g=\r\novern how this works. Under the push of one&#39;s own previous karmas, one is p=\r\nlaced in situations that are conducive to certain desires, actions and awar=\r\neness. The current karmas in those situations may further modify the moment=\r\num of the push (reaction) from previous actions. Though one&#39;s current desir=\r\nes, actions and awareness are actually the work of the all pervading shakti=\r\n, they are also one&#39;s work in a way. It depends on how we look at it and ho=\r\nw we abstract it. Though Ganges water in a bucket, Ganges water in a small =\r\ncup, Ganges water in a cup in hot weather and Ganges water in a cup in free=\r\nzing weather are all Ganges water, they are different too. One is more, one=\r\n is less, one is warm and one is icy. Similarly, the work of all pervading =\r\nshakti is different when expressed through different vessels (people) in di=\r\nfferent situations.\n \nAs long as one actually feels internally (despite wha=\r\nt one may say or pretend externally) that one&#39;s desires, actions and knowle=\r\ndge are one&#39;s own, one is performing karmas and is bound to receive their k=\r\naarmik reactions. Only when the realization that it is all the work of the =\r\nall pervading shakti becomes full and completely internalized, does one bec=\r\nome free from the cycle of actions and reactions.\n \n*        *        *\n \nT=\r\nhus, any tests one may encounter are reactions to one&#39;s own actions in orde=\r\nr to facilitate one&#39;s journey towards realizing Self. It is not that the Mo=\r\nther does not like one or wants to see how one does. The tester, the tested=\r\n and the test are all different expressions of the Mother only. But, for on=\r\ne who does not realize it fully, they are tests thrown at one.\n \n*        *=\r\n        *\n \nIf one desired a particular pleasure in a previous life, one ma=\r\ny be placed in a situation where that pleasure can be had now. That can be =\r\ncalled a test or simply a reaction to one&#39;s desire. Irrespective of what we=\r\n call it, one cannot become free without correct handling of that situation=\r\n.\n \nIf one abused a specific branch of knowledge in a previous life and gav=\r\ne some bad name to it, one may be placed in a situation where one can do ju=\r\nstice to that branch of knowledge and give it some good name now. That can =\r\nbe called a test or a reaction to one&#39;s action. Irrespective of what we cal=\r\nl it, one cannot become free without correct handling of that situation. An=\r\nd so on.\n \n*        *        *\n \nOne needs to experience the reactions to a=\r\nll of one&#39;s actions - good and bad - eventually. Whether one realizes it or=\r\n not, liberation is the final goal of all and all people are marching towar=\r\nds it only. Thus, testing (having to face reactions to one&#39;s own tricky act=\r\nions in the past) automatically happens as one marches in the evolution tow=\r\nards liberation, sadhana or no sadhana. With spiritual sadhana, some karmas=\r\n are fully or mosly dropped from the pipeline and the dynamics and timing o=\r\nf which karma gives results when may change.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIt is =\r\nunproductive to think in terms of &quot;I am being tested&quot;, &quot;I need to pass this=\r\n test&quot;, &quot;will I fail this test&quot; etc? The tests one has to face in one&#39;s spi=\r\nritual evolution are not like tests we face in our studies. It is not like =\r\nyou fail and that&#39;s the end of it or it becomes a blot on your record. You =\r\nkeep getting a chances again and again, until you finally pass. You have to=\r\n experience various experiences until none of them block you from Self.\n \nB=\r\nest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free J=\r\nyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and P=\r\nitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Fil=\r\nms that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n----------------------------------------=\r\n-------------------------------\n \n---- parijat_d &lt;parijat_d@...&gt; wrot=\r\ne: \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;          i am parijat dutta from kolkata.there are some is=\r\nsues going on i need to discuss..\n&gt; \n&gt; since i was 18-19,i became intereste=\r\nd in tantras.and i worship ma kali.bt i feel i had and may be have to face =\r\nseveral tests....like initially...i read books on tantra....wich promise hi=\r\nghly materialistically beneficial sadhanas..\n&gt; and alarmingly different die=\r\nties for each purpose...i fell for that...an my devotion was divided...betw=\r\neen maa kali,durga,laxmi,hanumanji..\n&gt; \n&gt; with time i realized all these ha=\r\nve no value without a gurus guidance.....my astrologer told me....that time=\r\n will be arnd 29-30 of my age.\n&gt; \n&gt; then again...i was against krishna wors=\r\nhip.....cuzz i thot fooshingly  since he is only about love(bhakti)....he m=\r\nay not be strong like devis..\n&gt; again since...all the tridevs need shakti..=\r\n.so i felt shakti worship is the highest....\n&gt; un\n&gt; also...at that time..i =\r\ndidnot like ramkrishna dev since he talked mostly of devotion...n not of po=\r\nwers like siddhis....\n&gt; undestanding others thoughts n so on...as  i have p=\r\nersonally seen some tantrics who have this power..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; with time again =\r\ni learnt bhakti is the highest.......i asked once a maharaj who presides ov=\r\ner the ashram where my mother was initiated ...\n&gt; which is more powerful ??=\r\n bhakti or mantras ??....\n&gt; \n&gt; he said...in one word...bhakti is more power=\r\nful...without bhakti u wont have the urge to have a mantra...\n&gt; \n&gt; again in=\r\n a book....i read...the love of gopis for krishna was such.....they forgot =\r\neverything of mundane world..\n&gt; they didnot want to know who krishna was...=\r\n..dint care if he was god or not......jst loving for the sake of loving..\n&gt;=\r\n bhakti only for the sake of bhakti....\n&gt; \n&gt; how wonderful !!!....all these=\r\n made me realize.....how foolish i was.....all i used to have for maa was b=\r\nhakti...i dint \n&gt; know any mantra nothin (not now as well) and i was agains=\r\nt on the other hand .....of krishna and ramkrishnadev who were epitome of b=\r\nhakti...\n&gt; \n&gt; at this time....i used to go to my mom&#39;s gurumaatas ashram...=\r\nonce in a spiritual discussion they said..\n&gt; get hold of only one ......he/=\r\nshe is antaryami...she understands wat ur inner needs her...like a parent\n&gt;=\r\n definitely she will fulfill them......\n&gt; \n&gt; at the same time....narasimha =\r\nji told in one of the mails........&quot;mother knows the best&quot;...\n&gt; \n&gt; these ha=\r\nve removed the misconceptions i had ...\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; what i want to know is when=\r\n one is devoted to maa why does she test ??.....is it a way to bring one cl=\r\noser to her through realizations ??...\n&gt; \n&gt; when shes the all pervading sha=\r\nkti....why thers a need for test ??....also...while testing does she give h=\r\ner child enuff \n&gt; strength to pass the test ??\n&gt; \n&gt; i am looking forward to=\r\n guidance from u people...\n\n\n"}}
