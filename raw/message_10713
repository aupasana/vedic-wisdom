But it&#39;s not for the\n&gt; timid.&quot; - Q, Star Trek TNG\n&gt;\n&gt; Who am I?\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; Am I a body which is believed to have a soul?\n&gt;\n&gt; I came into existence t=\r\nhe moment this body was conceived. It verifies my\n&gt; being, validates my lif=\r\ne. It has a brain that makes sense of the gibberish\n&gt; that is thrown at it,=\r\n finds a purpose and leads me the way I am supposed to\n&gt; be led. My body al=\r\nso has a heart. It feels, it loves and makes me desire\n&gt; everything more an=\r\nd more. An organ called soul is yet to be found.\n&gt;\n&gt; Then, there is the poi=\r\nnt when my body exists but my brain and heart stop\n&gt; functioning. I sometim=\r\nes wonder if I am a body, how can I experience things\n&gt; that are way beyond=\r\n its extremities. If I am a body, I shouldn&#39;t be dead\n&gt; before my body is i=\r\nncinerated on the funeral pyre.\n&gt;\n&gt; Perhaps, I am a soul which sometimes ch=\r\nooses to have a body.\n&gt;\n&gt; I am here to learn, experience and discover. What=\r\n I know prevails even\n&gt; when my body does not. I&#39;ll also teach, share and i=\r\nnspire; sometimes\n&gt; without my body&#39;s intervention. I know, this body is an=\r\n illusion although\n&gt; sometimes I prefer not to remember this fact so that I=\r\n can allow myself to\n&gt; indulge without worrying about the consequences and =\r\nwitness whatever\n&gt; transpires.\n&gt;\n&gt; Once I have experienced all there is to =\r\nexperience, learned whatever I\n&gt; need to learn, the illusion will help me b=\r\nreak free from the life - death\n&gt; cycle and I&#39;ll return to my rightful plac=\r\ne. But, if I am not careful, it\n&gt; will turn the cycle into a perpetual trap=\r\n. I can be addicted to various\n&gt; bonds. The blinding emotions will never le=\r\nt me remember the fact which I\n&gt; had chosen to forget temporarily. Misguide=\r\nd by attachments, I&#39;ll be lost in\n&gt; a flurry of conflicting anomalies. If, =\r\nas fate would have it, that happens,\n&gt; I&#39;ll be drawn here at the temple of =\r\nthe dark, ultimate truth.\n&gt;\n&gt; This eerily calm place is called the Shmashan=\r\n, the cremation ground - a\n&gt; gateway to both the heaven of moksh and the he=\r\nll of rebirth. This place is\n&gt; where empty shells turn to ash, the worthles=\r\ns is disposed of and myths are\n&gt; dispelled. It is so attuned to banishing t=\r\nhe illusionary light that its\n&gt; mere mention maddens the ignorant and drive=\r\ns them away.\n&gt;\n&gt; Detachment must come naturally - unabashed and free from a=\r\nll comforting\n&gt; lures. There can&#39;t be even a trace of any worldly affair.  =\r\nI must learn to\n&gt; separate the essence from the semblance. Once I have mast=\r\nered the ensemble\n&gt; and the parts, I&#39;ll be free. My existence will be devoi=\r\nd of sadness. I&#39;ll\n&gt; savor the pleasure in every possible way. Then, I&#39;ll g=\r\net caught again. Only\n&gt; then, I&#39;ll be able to understand that like my capti=\r\nvity, my freedom is also\n&gt; an illusion.\n&gt;\n&gt; The more I look at the funeral =\r\npyre, the more it intrigues me. First, the\n&gt; blistering heat boils the fles=\r\nh away from the bones; then, it chars them\n&gt; differently into a single subs=\r\ntance, ash. So many bodies, so different from\n&gt; each other and yet, they al=\r\nl end up the same, indistinguishable from each\n&gt; other.\n&gt;\n&gt; Dancing on a wh=\r\nim, flowing transcendentally, spreading warmth without\n&gt; bias, the fire tha=\r\nt burns the funeral pyre needs sustenance, produces smoke\n&gt; and leaves resi=\r\ndue. It may brighten my surroundings, but it can&#39;t enlighten\n&gt; me.\n&gt;\n&gt; The =\r\nfire that can enlighten me does not brighten anything at all. It is\n&gt; darke=\r\nr than the darkest corner of my psyche. It is omnipresent, relies on\n&gt; noth=\r\ning and annihilates everything. The ignorant project it as a symbol of\n&gt; ne=\r\ngativity the world over. The wise embrace it as the blessing of goddess\n&gt; K=\r\nali.\n&gt;\n&gt; Goddess Kali is the presiding deity of the Shmashan. She is the be=\r\nginning,\n&gt; she is the end. A primal force that enchants everything, she des=\r\ntroys\n&gt; worldly bondages while blessing with divine pleasures. She is the s=\r\ntark\n&gt; representation of the ultimate truth, she is the illusion. She is th=\r\ne one\n&gt; who dominates this universe. Damned or blessed, she listens to all.=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I don&#39;t need to call her. I don&#39;t need complex procedures, long ritual=\r\ns or\n&gt; tongue twisting mantras to blend with her. All I need is Kalika Asht=\r\nak.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kalika Ashtak is an eight versed hymn created by Adi Shankaracharya=\r\n. It\n&gt; encompasses the energy that existed before the inception of time. It=\r\n\n&gt; vibrates with the darkness that will prevail after everything else has\n&gt;=\r\n perished. Everyone who should know it, knows it; many experience divine jo=\r\ny\n&gt; reciting it; and some transcend the visible universe meditating on it. =\r\nIt\n&gt; can negate every negativity.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have my share of negativity. It is =\r\nway too potent for conventional\n&gt; means. It has a much larger sphere of inf=\r\nluence. It affects everything\n&gt; associated with me; but, to my utter dismay=\r\n, it hurts me the most.\n&gt;\n&gt; Kalika Ashtak protects me from my own negativit=\r\ny. It engulfs my negativity\n&gt; with the darkness emanating from goddess Kali=\r\n, transforms it into energy\n&gt; and channels it towards my Kundalini enabling=\r\n me to achieve any goal.\n&gt;\n&gt; Tonight, it will enliven the Shmashan for me.\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; http://chronicles-of-a-sadhak.blogspot.com/\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt;\n\r\n--001a113ee6a41bea27051fc3cd70\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;p dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;A very informative article.

I sometimes wonder if I am a body, how can I experience thi=\r\nngs that are way\n beyond its extremities. If I am a body, I shouldn&#39;t b=\r\ne dead before my body is incinerated on the funeral pyre.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Perhaps, I am a soul which sometimes chooses to have a =\r\nbody.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;I am here to learn, experience a=\r\nnd discover. What I know prevails even when my body does not. I&#39;ll also=\r\n teach, share and inspire; sometimes without my body&#39;s intervention. I =\r\nknow, this body is an illusion although sometimes I prefer not to remember =\r\nthis fact so that I can allow myself to indulge without worrying about the =\r\nconsequences and witness whatever transpires.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=\r\n=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Once I have experienced all there is to experience, learned whate=\r\nver I need to learn, the illusion will help me break free from the life - d=\r\neath cycle and I&#39;ll return to my rightful place. But, if I am not caref=\r\nul, it will turn the cycle into a perpetual trap. I can be addicted to vari=\r\nous bonds. The blinding emotions will\n never let me remember the fact which=\r\n I had chosen to forget temporarily. Misguided by attachments, I&#39;ll be =\r\nlost in a flurry of conflicting anomalies. If, as fate would have it, that =\r\nhappens, I&#39;ll be drawn here at the temple of the dark, ultimate truth.&lt;=\r\nbr clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;This eerily calm place is called the S=\r\nhmashan, the cremation ground - a gateway to both the heaven of moksh and t=\r\nhe hell of rebirth. This place is where empty shells turn to ash, the worth=\r\nless is disposed of and myths are dispelled. It is so attuned to banishing =\r\nthe illusionary light that its mere mention maddens the ignorant and drives=\r\n them away.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Detachment must come natur=\r\nally - unabashed and free from all comforting lures. There can&#39;t be eve=\r\nn a trace of any worldly affair.=C2=A0 I must learn to separate the essence=\r\n from the semblance. Once I have mastered the ensemble and the parts, I&#39=\r\n;ll be free. My existence will be devoid of sadness.\n I&#39;ll savor the pl=\r\neasure in every possible way. Then, I&#39;ll get caught again. Only then, I=\r\n&#39;ll be able to understand that like my captivity, my freedom is also an=\r\n illusion.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;The more I look at the fune=\r\nral pyre, the more it intrigues me. First, the blistering heat boils the fl=\r\nesh away from the bones; then, it chars them differently into a single subs=\r\ntance, ash. So many bodies, so different from each other and yet, they all =\r\nend up the same, indistinguishable from each other.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br c=\r\nlear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Dancing on a whim, flowing transcendentally, spreading warmth=\r\n without bias, the fire that burns the funeral pyre needs sustenance, produ=\r\nces smoke and leaves residue. It may brighten my surroundings, but it can&#=\r\n39;t enlighten me.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;The fire that can e=\r\nnlighten me does not brighten anything at all. It is darker than the darkes=\r\nt corner of my psyche. It is omnipresent, relies on nothing and\n annihilate=\r\ns everything. The ignorant project it as a symbol of negativity the world o=\r\nver. The wise embrace it as the blessing of goddess Kali.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Goddess Kali is the presiding deity of the Shmashan. Sh=\r\ne is the beginning, she is the end. A primal force that enchants everything=\r\n, she destroys worldly bondages while blessing with divine pleasures. She i=\r\ns the stark representation of the ultimate truth, she is the illusion. She =\r\nis the one who dominates this universe. Damned or blessed, she listens to a=\r\nll.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;I don&#39;t need to call her. I do=\r\nn&#39;t need complex procedures, long rituals or tongue twisting mantras to=\r\n blend with her. All I need is Kalika Ashtak.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=\r\n=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Kalika Ashtak is an eight versed hymn created by Adi Shankarachar=\r\nya. It encompasses the energy that existed before the inception of time. It=\r\n vibrates with the darkness that will prevail after everything else has\n pe=\r\nrished. Everyone who should know it, knows it; many experience divine joy r=\r\neciting it; and some transcend the visible universe meditating on it. It ca=\r\nn negate every negativity.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;I have my s=\r\nhare of negativity. It is way too potent for conventional means. It has a m=\r\nuch larger sphere of influence. It affects everything associated with me; b=\r\nut, to my utter dismay, it hurts me the most.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=\r\n=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Kalika Ashtak protects me from my own negativity. It engulfs my n=\r\negativity with the darkness emanating from goddess Kali, transforms it into=\r\n energy and channels it towards my Kundalini enabling me to achieve any goa=\r\nl.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;Tonight, it will enliven the Shmash=\r\nan for me.&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; shape=\r\n=3D&quot;rect&quot; href=3D&quot;http://chronicles-of-a-sadhak.blogspot.com/&quot; target=3D&quot;_b=\r\nlank&quot;&gt;http://chronicles-of-a-sadhak.blogspot.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    =\r\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br clear=\r\n=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;br clear=3D&quot;none&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n   =\r\n &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;  &lt;/tr&gt;   &lt;/tbody&gt;   &lt;/table&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#fff;min-height:0&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n=\r\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--001a113ee6a41bea27051fc3cd70--\r\n\n"}}
