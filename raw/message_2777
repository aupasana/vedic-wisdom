It explains the =\r\ncalculation of Pranapada,\ngiven in Jyotish text by Sage Parashara, and its =\r\nimpact on the spiritual\nevolution of man according to Yoga principles.\n\nTo =\r\nunderstand the Prana-pada is to appreciate the impact of Sun (Nature)\non hu=\r\nman evolution. Remembring the words of Paramahansa Yogananda in his\nfamous =\r\n&#39;Autobiography of a Yogi&#39;,  the ancient rishis discovered that\nman&#39;s earthl=\r\ny and heavenly environment, in twelve-year cycles, push him\nforward on his =\r\nnatural path. It explains that the 6 spinal centers\n(medullary, cervical, d=\r\norsal, lumbar, sacral, and coccygeal plexuses)\ncorrespond to the 12 astral =\r\nsigns of the zodiac, the symbolic Cosmic Man\n(KalaPurusha in Jyotish). That=\r\n the astral/subtle system of a human being\nis interrelated with the physica=\r\nl sun and the twelve zodiacal signs.\nThis implies that movement of prana-pa=\r\nda in Zodiac has an\ninterconnection with the movement of life-force in the =\r\nastral/subtle\nbody of man.\n\nPrana-pada is calculated as a function of longi=\r\ntude of Transit Sun, time\nelapsed (in ghati) since Sunrise and the Sign tha=\r\nt Sun is transiting. \nWe are only concerned with the movement of Pranapada =\r\nat the time of\nSolar ingress into the next Sign in Zodiac. This can be unde=\r\nrstood as\nfollows:\n\n1. Sun transits through a Zodiacal sign in about 30 day=\r\ns. While in a\nsign, owing to the Guna of sign, Sun acquires a predominant G=\r\nuna (i.e.\none of the three - Satva,Rajas, Tamas). Thus, Sun acquires Satva,=\r\n Rajo,\nTamo gunas in Dual, Fixed, Movable signs respectively. This happens\n=\r\ncyclically 4 times in an year (3 Gunas x 4 =3D 12 signs), as there are 4\nDu=\r\nal, 4 Fixed and 4 Movable signs each in the Zodiac.\n\n2. When Sun moves to n=\r\next sign it acquires another Guna. Also, during\ntransit to another sign, it=\r\n instantly pushes pranapada forward by 240\ndegrees ahead in the Zodiac or t=\r\no the beginning of the 9th sign. Note\nthat with every 240 degrees movement,=\r\n Guna associated with the Pranapada\n(Pranapada being a reference point acqu=\r\nires the guna of the underlying\nsign) changes. The change of Guna for Prana=\r\npada happens according to\nTamo-&gt;Rajo, Rajo-&gt;Satva, Satva-&gt;Tamo. This moveme=\r\nnt of Prana-pada has\ntwo-fold implications:\n\na.) In a metaphysical sense,  =\r\nchange of Guna activates the corresponding\nchannel (Nadi) in the subtle bod=\r\ny (Chitra Nadi for Satva Guna, Vajra\nNadi for Rajo Guna, and Sushumna Nadi =\r\nfor Tamo Guna) since it is\naccompanied with force, caused by Solar ingress =\r\ninto next Sign, that\ninstantly pushed prana-pada by 8 signs in the Zodiac. =\r\nThus, motion of\nPranapada in 3 months, acquiring three different Gunas in t=\r\nhe process,\nand activating the Tamo, Rajo and Satva Gunas in a cyclic order=\r\n is an\nindicator of gradual refinement of impressions (cleansing) in the as=\r\ntral\nsystem of man even as Sushumna, Vajra, and Chitra Nadis are successive=\r\nly\nfiner. This establishes the importance of Solar ingress in a Sign as\ncau=\r\nsing refinement of consciousness associated with the subtle channels\nof ene=\r\nrgy.\n\nb.) Pranapada moving 240 degree or 8 signs ahead in a month, and thus=\r\n 24\nsigns in 3 months. Putting mantra into the Zodiac, each of these 24 sig=\r\nn\nmovements is likened to an Akshara of the Savitur Gayatri mantra of 24\nAk=\r\nshara. Also, the Gayatri mantra is divided into three parts that are\narrang=\r\ned in the order of Tamo, Rajo and Satva Guna respectively*. The\nrelationshi=\r\np between Pranapada and Gayatri Mantra is underscored by the\nfact that Gaya=\r\ntri Mantra is dedicated to Sun, that Veda-mata Gayatri is\nreferred to as a =\r\nsister to the Sun God/Surya, and that Gayatri mantra is\nrecited to protect =\r\nones&#39; Prana. Thus, the cleansing and uplifting role\nof Pranapada and Gayatr=\r\ni mantra is clearly brought out and it can be\nsaid that the subtle effect (=\r\non Prana) of movement of Sun in firmament\nis same as recitation of Gayatri =\r\nMantra.\n\n3. In 3 months, Prana(-pada) cleanses the subtle body impressions =\r\nonce,\n4 times in an year and 48 times in 12 years. Since there are 49 Marut=\r\ns**\nin the astral body, the 49th being representative of the divine\nawarene=\r\nss(Refer: Bhagavad Gita - Marichi among the Maruts) in\nKutastha(forehead), =\r\nit is clear that the subtle body cleansing effected\nby Pranapada in 12 year=\r\ns, brings about &quot;slightest spiritual evolution&quot;\nin the astral brain and eff=\r\nects a glimpse of divine Kutastha Chetana.\n\nThus, the relationship between =\r\nthe Prana-pada and Gayatri Mantra, as\nwell as the role of Pranapada in prog=\r\nressive cleansing of human subtle\nbody consciousness has been explained.\n\n*=\r\n The three parts of the the tri-pad Savitur Gayatri mantra can be\nunderstoo=\r\nd as invocations to the three Gunas of Saguna Brahman as\nfollows, based on =\r\nthe objective of the invocation:\nTamo Guna  - Tat Savitur Varenyam\nRajo Gun=\r\na  - Bhargo Devasya Dhimahi\nSatva Guna - Dhiyo Yo NaH Prachodayat\n** There =\r\nare 7 principle Vayus in the Astral system of man as well as in\nthe Univers=\r\ne. These are further divided into 7 parts each giving rise to\n49 Maruts or =\r\nlife-currents. These 49 Maruts are said to move at the\nfront of the chariot=\r\n of Sun God as it moves through the firmament. They\nare also divided amongs=\r\nt the 6 plexuses: medullary (1), cervical (16),\ndorsal(12), lumbar(10), sac=\r\nral(6), and coccygeal(4).\n\nRegards,\n\nNitish\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com, Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@...&gt;\nwrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt; I do not know whether the=\r\n posts on this group are moderated, but I\nwould\n&gt; request that posts with t=\r\nhis kind of rude and derisive tone not be\nallowed.\n&gt; Allowing such threads =\r\nto continue endlessly will, I&#39;m afraid, deter\nsincere\n&gt; people from posting=\r\n their genuine thoughts and questions on sadhana\nand\n&gt; homam out of fear of=\r\n being derided publicly on the list or out of\nshyness\n&gt; since few want to e=\r\nngage in such combative dialogue.

It explains the calculation o=\r\nf Pranapada, given in Jyotish text by Sage Parashara, and its impact on the=\r\n spiritual evolution of man according to Yoga principles.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;To underst=\r\nand the Prana-pada is to appreciate the impact of Sun (Nature) on human evo=\r\nlution. Remembring the words of Paramahansa Yogananda in his famous &#39;Autobi=\r\nography of a Yogi&#39;,  the ancient rishis discovered that man&#39;s earthly and h=\r\neavenly environment, in twelve-year cycles, push him forward on his natural=\r\n path. It explains that the 6 spinal centers (medullary, cervical, dorsal, =\r\nlumbar, sacral, and coccygeal plexuses) correspond to the 12 astral signs o=\r\nf the zodiac, the symbolic Cosmic Man (KalaPurusha in Jyotish). That the as=\r\ntral/subtle system of a human being is interrelated with the physical sun a=\r\nnd the twelve zodiacal signs. This implies that movement of prana-pada in Z=\r\nodiac has an interconnection with the movement of life-force in the astral/=\r\nsubtle body of man.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Prana-pada is calculated as a function of longit=\r\nude of Transit Sun, time elapsed (in ghati) since Sunrise and the Sign that=\r\n Sun is transiting.  We are only concerned with the movement of Pranapada a=\r\nt the time of Solar ingress into the next Sign in Zodiac. This can be under=\r\nstood as follows:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1. Sun transits through a Zodiacal sign in about 3=\r\n0 days. While in a sign, owing to the Guna of sign, Sun acquires a predomin=\r\nant Guna (i.e. one of the three - Satva,Rajas, Tamas). Thus, Sun acquires S=\r\natva, Rajo, Tamo gunas in Dual, Fixed, Movable signs respectively. This hap=\r\npens cyclically 4 times in an year (3 Gunas x 4 =3D 12 signs), as there are=\r\n 4 Dual, 4 Fixed and 4 Movable signs each in the Zodiac.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2. When Sun=\r\n moves to next sign it acquires another Guna. Also, during transit to anoth=\r\ner sign, it instantly pushes pranapada forward by 240 degrees ahead in the =\r\nZodiac or to the beginning of the 9th sign. Note that with every 240 degree=\r\ns movement, Guna associated with the Pranapada (Pranapada being a reference=\r\n point acquires the guna of the underlying sign) changes. The change of Gun=\r\na for Pranapada happens according to Tamo-&gt;Rajo, Rajo-&gt;Satva, Satva-&=\r\ngt;Tamo. This movement of Prana-pada has two-fold implications:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;a.) =\r\nIn a metaphysical sense,  change of Guna activates the corresponding channe=\r\nl (Nadi) in the subtle body (Chitra Nadi for Satva Guna, Vajra Nadi for Raj=\r\no Guna, and Sushumna Nadi for Tamo Guna) since it is accompanied with force=\r\n, caused by Solar ingress into next Sign, that instantly pushed prana-pada =\r\nby 8 signs in the Zodiac. Thus, motion of Pranapada in 3 months, acquiring =\r\nthree different Gunas in the process, and activating the Tamo, Rajo and Sat=\r\nva Gunas in a cyclic order is an indicator of gradual refinement of impress=\r\nions (cleansing) in the astral system of man even as Sushumna, Vajra, and C=\r\nhitra Nadis are successively finer. This establishes the importance of Sola=\r\nr ingress in a Sign as causing refinement of consciousness associated with =\r\nthe subtle channels of energy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;b.) Pranapada moving 240 degree or 8 =\r\nsigns ahead in a month, and thus 24 signs in 3 months. Putting mantra into =\r\nthe Zodiac, each of these 24 sign movements is likened to an Akshara of the=\r\n Savitur Gayatri mantra of 24 Akshara. Also, the Gayatri mantra is divided =\r\ninto three parts that are arranged in the order of Tamo, Rajo and Satva Gun=\r\na respectively*. The relationship between Pranapada and Gayatri Mantra is u=\r\nnderscored by the fact that Gayatri Mantra is dedicated to Sun, that Veda-m=\r\nata Gayatri is referred to as a sister to the Sun God/Surya, and that Gayat=\r\nri mantra is recited to protect ones&#39; Prana. Thus, the cleansing and uplift=\r\ning role of Pranapada and Gayatri mantra is clearly brought out and it can =\r\nbe said that the subtle effect (on Prana) of movement of Sun in firmament i=\r\ns same as recitation of Gayatri Mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3. In 3 months, Prana(-pada)=\r\n cleanses the subtle body impressions once, 4 times in an year and 48 times=\r\n in 12 years. Since there are 49 Maruts** in the astral body, the 49th bein=\r\ng representative of the divine awareness(Refer: Bhagavad Gita - Marichi amo=\r\nng the Maruts) in Kutastha(forehead), it is clear that the subtle body clea=\r\nnsing effected by Pranapada in 12 years, brings about &quot;slightest spiritual =\r\nevolution&quot; in the astral brain and effects a glimpse of divine Kutastha Che=\r\ntana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thus, the relationship between the Prana-pada and Gayatri Mant=\r\nra, as well as the role of Pranapada in progressive cleansing of human subt=\r\nle body consciousness has been explained.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* The three parts of the t=\r\nhe tri-pad Savitur Gayatri mantra can be understood as invocations to the t=\r\nhree Gunas of Saguna Brahman as follows, based on the objective of the invo=\r\ncation:&lt;BR&gt;   Tamo Guna  - Tat Savitur Varenyam&lt;BR&gt;   Rajo Guna  - Bhargo D=\r\nevasya Dhimahi&lt;BR&gt;   Satva Guna - Dhiyo Yo NaH Prachodayat&lt;BR&gt; ** There are=\r\n 7 principle Vayus in the Astral system of man as well as in the Universe. =\r\nThese are further divided into 7 parts each giving rise to 49 Maruts or lif=\r\ne-currents. These 49 Maruts are said to move at the front of the chariot of=\r\n Sun God as it moves through the firmament. They are also divided amongst t=\r\nhe 6 plexuses: medullary (1), cervical (16), dorsal(12), lumbar(10), sacral=\r\n(6), and coccygeal(4).&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;P&gt;Regards,&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;Nitish&lt;/P&gt;&lt;P&gt;--- In vedic=\r\n-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Aditi Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P=\r\n&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I do not know whether the posts on this group are moderated, =\r\nbut I would&lt;BR&gt;&gt; request that posts with this kind of rude and derisive =\r\ntone not be allowed.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Allowing such threads to continue endlessly wi=\r\nll, I&#39;m afraid, deter sincere&lt;BR&gt;&gt; people from posting their genuine tho=\r\nughts and questions on sadhana and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; homam out of fear of being derid=\r\ned publicly on the list or out of shyness&lt;BR&gt;&gt; since few want to engage =\r\nin such combative dialogue.
