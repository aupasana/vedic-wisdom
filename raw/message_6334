This helps me daily to fill my mind with gl=\r\nories and story of Narayan. I read the english meaning before puja and it f=\r\nocuses my heart and soul. \n&gt; \n&gt; It has 100 chapters, each of which is 10shl=\r\nokas whcih is summary of 1 chapter of Bhagawat puran. if you read 1/2 story=\r\n daily, it will give new material daily for 100/50 days. Atleast my mind ge=\r\nts filled with joy daily to know new story about narayan daily and my daily=\r\n puja gets new motivation.\n&gt; \n&gt; You can read more on wikipedia or google it=\r\n.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; You can buy\n&gt; 1.
