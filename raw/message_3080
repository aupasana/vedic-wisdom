After all,=\r\n opponent in a debate is \n&gt; different from a &quot;questioner&quot; or a disciple see=\r\nking spiritual \n&gt; direction.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The topic of the meeting was something=\r\n like \n&gt; &quot;Concept of God in\n&gt; &gt; Hinduism and Islam&quot;.

They had the knack of \n&gt; steering the debate=\r\n in a direction that they wanted - a direction that \n&gt; would help establish=\r\n sanatana dharma. They did not tolerate adharma and \n&gt; ignorance with &quot;poli=\r\nte words&quot;. They destroyed adharma and ignorance with the \n&gt; sword of detach=\r\ned, and yet firm, actions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Fighting with hatred or anger or agitation=\r\n in the \n&gt; heart is bad.

He is no=\r\nt interested in \n&gt; anything else. He answers only when there is sincerity i=\r\nn the heart of the \n&gt; questioner. Otherwise he would say some polite words =\r\nand let it pass, however \n&gt; big the occasion may be. Most of the questions =\r\nthat were raised in that meeting \n&gt; were answered elaborately by Sri Sri in=\r\n his various commentaries & \n&gt; discourses year ago!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One may ask wh=\r\ny then did he go to this \n&gt; meeting or whatever it was? The topic of the me=\r\neting was something like &quot;Concept \n&gt; of God in Hinduism and Islam&quot;. IMHO, S=\r\nri Sri did justice to the topic by &quot;BEING&quot; \n&gt; an embodiment of the very thi=\r\nng that was supposedly the topic of discussion. \n&gt; Those that were ready to=\r\n benefit from it from the audience would have benefited. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ********=\r\n****\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The below part is not for \n&gt; Rajarshi but may be of interest =\r\nto everyone, especially those among us that are \n&gt; intellectually curious a=\r\nbout spirituality than practicing it. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; Sri Sri always practices=\r\n &quot;experience first and explanation and knowledge later&quot; \n&gt; principle. Somet=\r\nimes in AOL, there will be big congregation of thousands of \n&gt; people and S=\r\nri Sri will only say very simple things or share some simple jokes \n&gt; and l=\r\naughs, but his presence would convey what needs to be conveyed for those \n&gt;=\r\n that are receptive. A Master may not be interested in getting 100,000 peop=\r\nle \n&gt; trading one mental concept for another, but prefers one sincere perso=\r\nn opening \n&gt; up to Truth in silence. A Masters mere presence is enough for =\r\nthat to happen. \n&gt; Words are secondary and optional. In spiritual discussio=\r\nns,  the point of \n&gt; words is to create inner silence or illumination and i=\r\nf that is not created, \n&gt; there is no point in talking! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is a g=\r\nreat privilege and an \n&gt; immense blessing to be in the presence of a living=\r\n Master whether it is Sri Sri \n&gt; or someone else. We gain immensely if we l=\r\nisten to them from our Being instead \n&gt; of our mind. In Sri Ramakrishna&#39; s =\r\nlife, there are innumerable examples of very \n&gt; simple people benefiting fr=\r\nom his mere looks & presence while big \n&gt; intellectuals would debate with h=\r\nim and miss the opportunity of a lifetime. \n&gt; Sometimes when he countered i=\r\nnsincere queries, Sri Ramakrishna would feign \n&gt; ignorance and say what wou=\r\nld I know - I am an illiterate! What a disaster it \n&gt; would have been for a=\r\n seeker if he were to label Sri Ramakrishna as an \n&gt; illiterate and ignoram=\r\nus!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Without an accompanying experience \n&gt; (at least a small glimps=\r\ne or even a fragment of an experience) accumulating \n&gt; knowledge can be ver=\r\ny dangerous as it will become yet another mental concept and \n&gt; will actual=\r\nly be a hindrance to the Sadhak. Some of the most subtle and \n&gt; dangerous h=\r\nindrances for a sadhak are created by none other than the sadhak&#39;s \n&gt; empty=\r\n concepts of spirituality and God! Things like lust, greed, anger, etc., \n&gt;=\r\n stand out conspicuously and are in that way less dangerous. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; J=\r\nai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt;    Siva.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, \n&gt;=\r\n rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear \n&gt; Siva,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Nice mail. \n&gt; However I have one issue with Sr=\r\ni Ravishankar.

I occasionally \n&gt; visit t=\r\nhis forum. I happened to see several emails about AOL and the below email \n=\r\n&gt; from Shri. Narasimha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As a follower of AOL&#39;s spiritual \n&gt; practic=\r\nes and as a disciple and devotee of Sri Sri Ravishankar, I want to \n&gt; clari=\r\nfy a few things to the extent of my understanding.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There a=\r\nre several paths each leading to the destination of \n&gt; Sat-Chit-Ananda. Som=\r\ne are ritualistic, some use austerities, some use devotion, \n&gt; etc. AOL is =\r\na path, where the path to Bliss is also blissful. That does not make \n&gt; it =\r\nin any way inferior to paths of austerities. As Sri Aurobindo would call it=\r\n, \n&gt; it is a &quot;Sunlit path&quot;. In this path one does not suddenly emerge into =\r\n\n&gt; SatChitAnanda. The personality of the sadhak is transformed slowly and t=\r\nhe \n&gt; sadhak radiates more and more as they progress more and more.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my experience, AOL is a seamless blend of Raja yoga, \n&gt; Bhakti=\r\n yoga, Karma yoga and Gnana yoga. Spritual practice in AOL is not just \n&gt; d=\r\noing Sudarshan Kriya everyday as it is commonly (mis)understood. Pranayams =\r\nand \n&gt; Sudarshan Kriya are done for cleansing and settling of the mind and =\r\npreparing \n&gt; for meditation and doing other spiritual practices of contempl=\r\nation, Seva for \n&gt; rest of the day wit the right attitude. Regular practice=\r\n of Sudarshan Kriya \n&gt; removes / breaks old patterns and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A=\r\nOL \n&gt; includes some yoga asanas to prepare the body (the Padma Sadhana sequ=\r\nence of \n&gt; asanas taught in DSN course and Sun Salutations (Surya Namaskar)=\r\n taught in Part \n&gt; II or advance courses fall under this category.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The raja yoga practices include all the pranayams, Sudarshan Kr=\r\niya, mudras, \n&gt; bandhas, meditations taught in Art of Living course, advanc=\r\ne courses, Sahaj \n&gt; samadhi meditation course, etc.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The \n&gt;=\r\n Knowledge part includes deep contemplative study and imbibing of Narada Bh=\r\nakti \n&gt; Sutras, Patanjali Yoga Sutras, Ashtavakra Gita and Bhagavat Gita. S=\r\nri Sri \n&gt; Ravishankar has given very elaborate commentary on all of the abo=\r\nve. His \n&gt; commentary on Bhakti Sutras runs to 30 or so tapes and the publi=\r\ncly available \n&gt; commentary on Ashtavakra gita runs to over 33 DVD episodes=\r\n! Besides daily study \n&gt; of Yoga Vashishtam is highly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; recommended. =\r\nLearning and \n&gt; contemplation of this Wisdom is mandatory for those that st=\r\nrive to become Art of \n&gt; Living teachers.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The path of AOL =\r\nemphasises \n&gt; on Surrender and Seva. Guru puja to Guru parampara, nama sank=\r\neertan and bhajans \n&gt; are a standard feature of AOL satsangs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; Some wonder why AOL charges for these courses and some wonder about =\r\nlack of a \n&gt; Sadhguru at every stage.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Let me clarify \n&gt; fr=\r\nom my personal experiences that Sri Sri Ravishankar is a fully Enlightened =\r\n\n&gt; Master living in Sahaj Samadhi all times. He is capable of guiding milli=\r\nons of \n&gt; devotees in every step of the sadhana without having to be near t=\r\nhem in person. \n&gt; Several get necessary guidance in dreams (I myself had th=\r\nat experience twice), \n&gt; some in person and several via various other ways.=\r\n However, to get these \n&gt; guidance, an inner connection with the Master is =\r\nessential. Until that stage, \n&gt; the various AOL courses, Sri Sri&#39;s elaborat=\r\ne and in-depth commentaries on \n&gt; various Knowledge are more than enough to=\r\n guide disciples to a stage where \n&gt; conscious inner communion with Guru ca=\r\nn be established.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Several of the senior AOL teachers (most=\r\nly Swamis and Rishis) \n&gt; are yogis of a very high order capable of reaching=\r\n SatChitAnanda consciousness \n&gt; at will during meditation. They may be not =\r\nfully established in it like Sri Sri, \n&gt; but act as channels of the SatGuru=\r\n and can appropriate guide a Sadhak as and \n&gt; when needed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n It is very easy to accept \n&gt; those that left their body as having achieved=\r\n highest realization such as Sri \n&gt; Aurobindo or Sri Ramakrishna or Ramana =\r\nMaharishi. However it is a human tendency \n&gt; to doubt them when they are in=\r\n physical form.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regarding AOL charging money for its co=\r\nurses: AOL is world&#39;s largest \n&gt; volunteer run organization. Neither AOL te=\r\nachers nor its founder Sri Sri \n&gt; Ravishankar make monitory profits. All th=\r\ne proceeds go to the charitable \n&gt; activities again run by volunteers. Many=\r\n of the full time teachers have given up \n&gt; veyr lucrative careers and mill=\r\nions worth in property to become teachers and \n&gt; teach for free. Sri Sri Ra=\r\nvishankar neither needs all the money. All senior AOL \n&gt; teachers including=\r\n Sri Sri have went through very bad and sometimes even \n&gt; dangerous conditi=\r\nons to bring the Knowledge to the masses. This is a time when \n&gt; the highes=\r\nt Knowledge needs to be revealed to maximum number of people.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; Senior AOL teachers have faced danger to their \n&gt; lives by going wit=\r\nhout any help or guidance to areas infested with naxalites, \n&gt; terrorists i=\r\nn North East, Kashmir, Iraq, Palestine, Pakitan, Sri Lanka, etc. \n&gt; with no=\r\nthing but love and Divine Grace as their aid.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; As far as=\r\n I know, money is charged in AOL courses for two \n&gt; reasons.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; 1) Past experience showed that \n&gt; those that paid for the courses seem t=\r\no follow the practices more diligently. It \n&gt; is Sri Sri&#39;s guidance that no=\r\n deserving person should be denied a course because \n&gt; they cannot afford t=\r\no pay. As a volunteer, I was part of organizing several AOL \n&gt; courses and =\r\nknow first hand many cases where people took courses for free and \n&gt; were a=\r\nlso provided free accommodation, etc. Whenever natural disaster strikes, \n&gt;=\r\n AOL teachers go there paying from their own pocket or by AOL and teach cou=\r\nrses \n&gt; for free and provide healing to the victims. AOL does not advertise=\r\n it or make a \n&gt; show of it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) This is my understanding a=\r\nnd \n&gt; not AOl position. It removes the Karmic debt to the AOL teachers and =\r\nvolunteers \n&gt; who still may have some doership in them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Finally, Sri Sri is only interested in getting everyone turn inwards and e=\r\nxpress \n&gt; the love, joy and compassion that is inside everyone. As long as =\r\none follows a \n&gt; path, any path and surrenders to any Sat Guru, we are happ=\r\ny.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Jai Gurudev!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; Siva.\n\n\n"}}
