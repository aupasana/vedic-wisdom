Kindly do not judge =\r\nme based on my condition, rather give me some positive solution and perspec=\r\ntive to what I am going through.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am a very strong beloved of god and=\r\n a very strong devotee. I love to worship him as much as I can.however, all=\r\n my passion, interest seems to get drained and discouraged due to my mindse=\r\nt and the hell I go through because of it. I always , always get negative &=\r\n abusive thoughts and tie those to the god. For ex, if I hear a foul langua=\r\nge, see a negative thing, bad or foul my mind relates or ties it to god. My=\r\n mind start abusing god with the same foul language.\n&gt; When I do Japam, =EF=\r\n=BF=BDmy mind would not get concentration, but goes into this evil mode wit=\r\nh racing thoughts.\n&gt; I can&#39;t see directly into the eyes of god with the fea=\r\nr of my mind abusing him I can&#39;t focus my drishti on god statues. My though=\r\nts are extremely foul...most specially foul language. However, I battle my =\r\nthoughts with my worship, which means I don&#39;t give up praying him. I reques=\r\nted him several times to relive me from such pain so that I can increase my=\r\n devotion and prayers. I love him. I want to pray him.=EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Currently=\r\n, my mind and it&#39;s racing evil & foul thoughts have become a road block in =\r\nmy devotion and trying to keep me away from him as much as possible. At one=\r\n point of time, they dominated me and I had to stay away from praying him f=\r\nor a while.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now my questions are\n&gt; Am I a Maha papi or ghora papi that=\r\n this is happening to me?\n&gt; Why does it happen to me?\n&gt; Is it some kind of =\r\ndisorder\n&gt; Am in incurring wrath of god=EF=BF=BD\n&gt; I am scared to death tha=\r\nt I am accumulating the greatest sin enough for some 100 births\n&gt; What can =\r\nI do to get out of this perversion and be able to concentrate on him\n&gt; I wa=\r\nnt to worship god like every one does\n&gt; I am highly stressed because of thi=\r\ns constant battle.
