Of these, karma is the most talked about; it is\nals=\r\no the most misunderstood. The Gita says: &quot;Gahna Karmanyo Gathi&quot; --\nUnfathom=\r\nable are the ways of karma. ****\n\n** **\n\nThere are three types of karma: Pr=\r\narabha, sanchita and agami. The first is\nlatent karma, an impression or see=\r\nd of action. The second is karma as\naction, and the third is karma as resul=\r\nt. Prarabha means &#39;begun&#39;; the\naction that is already manifesting and that =\r\nis yielding its effect right\nnow. You cannot avoid it or change it, as it i=\r\ns already happening. Sanchita\nis accumulated karma. It is latent or manifes=\r\nted in the form of a tendency\nor impression in the mind. ****\n\n** **\n\nSanch=\r\nita karma can be burned off by spiritual practices before it\nmanifests. Aga=\r\nmi karma is the future karma of action; that which has not\nyet come and whi=\r\nch will take effect in the future. If you commit a crime,\nyou may not get c=\r\naught today, but will live with the possibility that one\nday you may get ca=\r\nught. ****\n\n** **\n\nKarma is also always bound by time, because every action=\r\n has a limited\nreaction. If you do something good to people they will come =\r\nto thank you\nand be grateful to you as long as they are experiencing the ef=\r\nfect of your\naction. So, karma has only a limited sphere of its effect, be =\r\nit good or\nbad. ****\n\n** **\n\n*It is often asked, &quot;Why are good people made =\r\nto suffer while those who\ncommit injustice go unpunished?&quot; Such questions a=\r\nrise when we see an event\nin its limited framework. No good action will yie=\r\nld a bad result and no bad\naction will bring a good result. This is the law=\r\n of karma. As you sow, so\nshall you reap. If you sow a mango tree, some tho=\r\nrny bushes may come up\nbecause of the seeds present in the manure brought f=\r\nrom somewhere else. It\nis not the mango seed that brings up the thorny bush=\r\n. Your mango seed will\nbring mango fruit, in due course. *\n\n** **\n\nKarma is=\r\n that which propels reincarnation. The stronger the impression, the\ngreater=\r\n the possibility of the next life being according to that. So, often\nyou re=\r\nincarnate like the person you hate or love. The mind which is full of\ndiffe=\r\nrent impressions leaves this body but the impressions await suitable\nsituat=\r\nions to come back. So the last thought is very important. Whatever\nyou do t=\r\nhroughout your life, in the last moment your mind should be free\nand happy.=\r\n ****\n\n** **\n\nOur perception of suffering, of good and bad, is always relat=\r\nive. God is\nabsolute reality; a witness of all. See God as movie director, =\r\nrather than\nas a judge. He has no ill feeling for the villain and no specia=\r\nl favour for\nthe hero. Each one is playing her role. ****\n\n** **\n\nAn awaren=\r\ness of dharma helps in comprehending the strange ways of karma.\nWhenever yo=\r\nu see bad karma or someone suffering, you need to help. That is\nyour dharma=\r\n. If you do not do your dharma, then you incur bad karma for not\nhaving don=\r\ne your dharma. Take recourse in your dharma to transcend the\nbondage of kar=\r\nma and avoid getting stuck with events or personalities. Live\nwith karma; d=\r\non&#39;t be attached to it. &#39;See action in inaction and inaction\nin action&#39; say=\r\ns the Gita. Awareness, alertness, knowledge and meditation\nwill help erase =\r\npast impressions. It has the strength to dissolve and\ndestroy any karma and=\r\n free you.****\n\n** **\n\nhttp://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/life-style/spirit=\r\nuality/vintage-wisdom/The-ways-of-karma/articleshow/8603911.cms\n****\n\n\n**\n-=\r\n- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=\r\n=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--90e6ba211f1b5580eb04ba0b2371\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div lang=3D&quot;EN-GB&quot; link=3D&quot;blue&quot; vlink=3D&quot;purpl=\r\ne&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;p class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;Every object in the universe is endowed with=\r\n four\ncharacteristics: dharma, karma, prema and gyana.
