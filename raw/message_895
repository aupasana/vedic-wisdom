Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I want to clarify one thing lest I be misunderstood. I am not at \nall sayi=\r\nng \n&gt; that people should not chant veda mantras. They can. But I am \npointi=\r\nng out \n&gt; that Veda mantras do not work to their potential these days.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I can clarify using an analogy. Imagine that mantras are the \nweapons used=\r\n to \n&gt; protect the mind from enemies (weaknesses). After all, mantra \ncomes=\r\n from \n&gt; mana and tra and does mean &quot;that which protects the mind&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; If=\r\n regular mantras are like sticks with which you can beat up \nenemies, veda =\r\n\n&gt; mantras are like powerful guns with which you can shoot with \nprecision.=\r\n \n&gt; However, the correct knowledge related to chanting and \nexperiencing ve=\r\nda \n&gt; mantras is pretty much lost today. Though there are people who \nposse=\r\nss a lot \n&gt; of guns, pretty much nobody knows how to shoot a gun. Thus, one=\r\n \nwho wants to \n&gt; use a gun will have to use it like a stick and beat the e=\r\nnemy with \nthe gun.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; personally, i am in fav=\r\nour of living thru my karmas with \nconsciousness\n&gt; &gt; rather than appeasing =\r\nanything/anyone. the grace of \nconsciousness of\n&gt; &gt; savitur is perhaps what=\r\n all of us are seeking, isn&#39;t it?\n&gt; \n&gt; I do not want to make a personal com=\r\nment on you, but want to say \nsomething \n&gt; in general.\n&gt; \n&gt; People talk abo=\r\nut living thru karmas with consciousness, about \nsurrendering \n&gt; and going =\r\nthrough the fruits of karmas with a stable mind etc. But \nthese \n&gt; things a=\r\nre easier to talk about than to actually do. When the \nfruit of a \n&gt; really=\r\n bad karma strikes, then it will be difficult to maintain \nthe same \n&gt; atti=\r\ntude and mental stability. One can be shaken. Being able to \nlive through \n=\r\n&gt; the fruits of *any* karma with a stable and unpertubed mind is \nindeed th=\r\ne \n&gt; goal of all. One can get there only after burning/exhausting \nseveral =\r\n\n&gt; blocking karmas.\n&gt; \n&gt; With some sadhana, some tranquility and stability =\r\nof mind comes. \nThat \n&gt; enables one to do better and more focussed sadhana.=\r\n That increases \nthe \n&gt; tranquility and stability of mind. That enables one=\r\n to do even \nbetter \n&gt; sadhana. This slowly picks up and eventually one rea=\r\nches the state \nwhere one \n&gt; can simply live through the fruits of *any* ka=\r\nrma without any \nimpact on the \n&gt; equanimity and stability of mind. Before =\r\nthat, serious sadhana is \nneeded.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Hom=\r\nam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yours=\r\nelf: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro=\r\n.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n=\r\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@...&gt;\n&gt; To:=\r\n &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, January 07, 2009 4:00 AM=\r\n\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: gayatri mantra\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; namaste narasimhaji=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; thankyou. your words are always very inspiring.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; yes, u ar=\r\ne right that what u had recorded was just the humming \nof ups\n&gt; &gt; and downs=\r\n of the mantra to show the intonation. it stuck in my \nmemory\n&gt; &gt; because i=\r\nt was very different from the mantra i have heard \nrecorded by\n&gt; &gt; various =\r\npeople.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; there may not be any perfect rendering of the mantra in the=\r\n \npresent\n&gt; &gt; times...but still one longs for something closer to the real\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; thing...whatever that may be.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; so the search continues....\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; personally, i am in favour of living thru my karmas with \nconsciousness\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; rather than appeasing anything/anyone. the grace of \nconsciousness of\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; savitur is perhaps what all of us are seeking, isn&#39;t it?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; however=\r\n, having a very very rudimentary &quot;knowledge&quot; of astrology \ni\n&gt; &gt; sometimes =\r\nindulge my imagination in thinking that with a retro \nmars,\n&gt; &gt; saturn and =\r\nmercury my karmas must be rather &quot;jatil&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; you mentioned about lord =\r\nsubramanya. carrying the imagination a \nlttle\n&gt; &gt; further, i find an echo o=\r\nf lord subramnaya in the krittika \nnakshatra\n&gt; &gt; which is the lagna nakshat=\r\nra. there is also (imaginatively \nspeaking)\n&gt; &gt; perhaps some connection to =\r\nhave jupiter, sun and mars on the \nadra -\n&gt; &gt; mool (rahu-ketu) axis or guru=\r\n-soul-karma axis?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Personally, i dont have any god i can visualise w=\r\nhile meditating\n&gt; &gt; though i feel an affinity to shiva sometimes. yesterday=\r\n while \ndoing\n&gt; &gt; the gayatri mantra i tried to visualise gayatri and for s=\r\nome \nreason\n&gt; &gt; that made me think about love and mother.... and that made =\r\nme \ncry.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; sorry, i may be getting carried away...so i will stop here=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; many thanks once again!\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; love and best wishes...\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; \n&lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Veda mantras are in a different league =\r\ncompared to other \nmantras. As\n&gt; &gt; I said\n&gt; &gt;&gt; earlier, it is possible to a=\r\nchieve the one-pointed focus of \nmind on any\n&gt; &gt;&gt; combination of sounds. Wh=\r\nen one&#39;s mind repeats the same \ncombination of\n&gt; &gt;&gt; sounds over and over ag=\r\nain, eventually one&#39;s mind may lose all \nother\n&gt; &gt;&gt; thoughts and become abs=\r\norbed in that combination of sounds. THEN\n&gt; &gt; one&#39;s mind\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experiences t=\r\nhe energy represented by that combination of \nsounds.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Different c=\r\nombinations of sounds have different energies. But\n&gt; &gt; experiencing\n&gt; &gt;&gt; th=\r\ne energy of any combination of sounds is a better experience \nfor\n&gt; &gt; the m=\r\nind\n&gt; &gt;&gt; than the regular chaotic experiences mind has in a cacaphony of\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; thoughts.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The energy represented by properly chanted Veda mantr=\r\nas is in a\n&gt; &gt; different\n&gt; &gt;&gt; league. However, it is almost impossible to c=\r\nhant Veda mantras\n&gt; &gt; perfectly in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; today&#39;s times. The knowledge is los=\r\nt. The way people chant \nthem, veda\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantras get corrupted and they end=\r\n up working like other \nmantras and\n&gt; &gt; do not\n&gt; &gt;&gt; really act as veda mant=\r\nras. Even if one experiences a veda \nmantra, one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; experiences the energ=\r\ny of a corrupted version and not of the\n&gt; &gt; original veda\n&gt; &gt;&gt; mantra.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; The expression &quot;Om bhur bhuvah suvah/svah&quot; is not part of the \nactual=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; savitru\n&gt; &gt;&gt; gayatri mantra. The actual veda mantra starts with &quot;tat \n=\r\nsavitur&quot; and\n&gt; &gt; ends\n&gt; &gt;&gt; with &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I never recorded =\r\nan audio clip of my Gayatri chanting. I only \nhummed\n&gt; &gt; the ups\n&gt; &gt;&gt; and d=\r\nowns to show the intonation. I was instructed to never \nchant\n&gt; &gt; Savitru\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; Gayatri mantra loud. Spiritually speaking, that mantra is my \nfood\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nand I get\n&gt; &gt;&gt; whatever little energy I have from it. In order to continue =\r\n\ndoing my\n&gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in the world, I will need to be selfish with my f=\r\nood. I can \nshare\n&gt; &gt; everything\n&gt; &gt;&gt; else with the world.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Astrol=\r\nogy knowledge that we have on earth today is insufficient \nto give\n&gt; &gt;&gt; per=\r\nfect guidance. A good guru may be able to do a better job \nthan\n&gt; &gt; astrolo=\r\ngy\n&gt; &gt;&gt; as we understand it.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I have seen my guru make some intere=\r\nsting mantra suggestions. \nFor\n&gt; &gt; example, I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; once mentioned to Manish=\r\n a friend who visits me often and \nmeditates\n&gt; &gt; when I\n&gt; &gt;&gt; do homam. Mani=\r\nsh said, &quot;he will not be interested in doing \nhomam by\n&gt; &gt; himself.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; If=\r\n at all he does, it will not be Mahaganapathi homam or Chandi\n&gt; &gt; homam. Te=\r\nach\n&gt; &gt;&gt; him Vishnu sahasra naama homam. He MAY be interested in that. He\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; will like\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Vishnu sahasra naama stotram.&quot; I had not mentioned much a=\r\nbout \nthat\n&gt; &gt; person to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Manish and only said the name. Interestingly,=\r\n Vishnu sahasra \nnaama\n&gt; &gt; stotra is\n&gt; &gt;&gt; indeed a favorite prayer of that =\r\nperson. Another time, I met a\n&gt; &gt; person who\n&gt; &gt;&gt; loves Ganapathi atharva s=\r\neersham and chants it everyday and\n&gt; &gt; interested in\n&gt; &gt;&gt; doing Mahaganapat=\r\nhi homam. Manish told me, &quot;if he wants, he can \ndo\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Mahaganapathi homam=\r\n. But eventually there is another sadhana he\n&gt; &gt; needs to do.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; He needs=\r\n to chant Hanuman Chalisa everyday 108 or 54 times for \none\n&gt; &gt; whole\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nyear. It will transform his life.&quot; I had not mentioned anything\n&gt; &gt; about t=\r\nhat\n&gt; &gt;&gt; person to Manish. Interestingly, when this person was young, he \nw=\r\nas\n&gt; &gt; a sishya\n&gt; &gt;&gt; of a great spiritual master in the lineage of Sadguru =\r\nSamartha \nRamadas\n&gt; &gt;&gt; (considered to be born with  Lord Hanuman&#39;s amsa). H=\r\ne said to me\n&gt; &gt; later that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; his guru had also advised him in the past =\r\nto just stick to \nHanuman\n&gt; &gt; chalisa!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Interestingly, the same suggest=\r\nion came to Manish&#39;s mind.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Of course, Manish tells me at other ti=\r\nmes that he knows nothing \nand\n&gt; &gt; says\n&gt; &gt;&gt; whatever comes to his mind. If=\r\n he ends up giving correct \nguidance to\n&gt; &gt;&gt; someone, he says it is because=\r\n the Mother wanted someone to get \ncorrect\n&gt; &gt;&gt; guidance and he is just a n=\r\nimitta.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; I believe that a sadguru with very limited individual ego=\r\n and in\n&gt; &gt; tune with\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Nature will be able to give far better guidance =\r\nin spiritual \nsadhana\n&gt; &gt; than\n&gt; &gt;&gt; astrology as we know it today.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; For Mars and Rahu in 8th, I can suggest Lord Subrahmanya.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Best =\r\nregards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n--\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstro=\r\nloger.org/homam\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologe=\r\nr.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt;&gt; F=\r\nree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jag=\r\nannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt;&gt; -------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n-- \n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Ori=\r\nginal Message ----- \n&gt; &gt;&gt; From: &quot;vinita kumar&quot; &lt;vinitakuma@&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedi=\r\nc-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Sunday, January 04, 2009 3:45 AM\n&gt; &gt;&gt; =\r\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] gayatri mantra\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; dear narasimha ji and fr=\r\niends,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; namaste!\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i understand that the syllables / metr=\r\ne of the mantra is very\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; important. that is why (probably) mantra was=\r\n passed on from \nthe guru\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to ths sishya by word of mouth. somebody e=\r\nven said that in \nthe end\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it is the metre only that remains in the m=\r\nantra...and not \neven the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; words. something like the smile of the che=\r\nshire cat remaining \neven\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; when the cat itself vanishes in alice in t=\r\nhe wonderland.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i too have been looking at / bringing to my co=\r\nnsciousness the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; gayatri mantra of late. for lack of guidance, i have=\r\n been \nrelying on\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the internet. the first thing that kind of took my=\r\n breath \naway was\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the layers and layers of meaning attached to each =\r\nword of the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; mantra. that is probably because all sanskrit words are =\r\nlike\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; that....you peel one layer and another layer lies below..and \nt=\r\nhen\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; still another and another....\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; but more importantly=\r\n (perhaps) is the different ways this \nmantra\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; gets recited. i tried =\r\nto count the syllables to see whether \nthey\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; added upto 24. they almo=\r\nst did, to my recknoning, but i \nwasn&#39;t sure\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; whether om in the begin=\r\nning is part of the mantra or not. it \nprobaly\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; is, but i want to be =\r\nsure.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; secondly, depending on who chants the mantra, the words=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; are &quot;spelt&quot; / &quot;pronounced&quot; differently. For instance in one\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nrendering i found &quot;swah&quot; being pronounced as &quot;suvah&quot; which \nbecomes\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\ntwo syllables instead of one. simarly, in the same\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; rendering &quot;pracho=\r\ndyat&quot; is stretched to 3 syllables instead of \n2.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; so i am conf=\r\nused as to the &quot;right&quot; rendition.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i recall, quite some time b=\r\nack, narsimha ji had posted his \nrendition\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of the gayatri mantra in =\r\nan audio clip. i have not been able \nto find\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; it again. but i wish he=\r\n or someone could guide me about this.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i would also like to k=\r\nnow the importance of the number of \nsyllables\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; in each mantra and ho=\r\nw this is suitable for different persons\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; depending on their &quot;karmic =\r\nstructures&quot; which are sometimes / \nalways\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; (?) reflected in the astro=\r\nlogical chart. maybe a guru by just\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; looking at a person can know int=\r\nuitively what is the &quot;right&quot; \nmantra\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; for the person. maybe a good as=\r\ntrologer can also do the same.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; i know this is not an astrolog=\r\ny forum, but still i am seeking\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; guidance on &quot;appeasement&quot; of mars an=\r\nd rahu in 8th house and \nretro\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; saturn in 6th house for taurus lagna.=\r\n..throough mantra.
