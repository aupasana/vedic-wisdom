For example if VSNS takes around 1 hour, then=\r\n start is approximately at the time during travel when an hour is left to r=\r\neach the destination.\n&gt; \n&gt; If still not finished due to some wrong time cal=\r\nculations, then sit for some time in you car and hear the stotra completely=\r\n :). We can surely do that if we really like listening to that. But that wi=\r\nll be too much for asking.\n&gt; \n&gt; People like you need to be congratulated wh=\r\no listen to Rudram and Sahastranam instead of listening to all the other st=\r\nuff.\n&gt; \n&gt; You surely know what I recommended.

In fact, even if the original expert recorded it mechan=\r\nically and without much devotion, you will still get good punya from it if =\r\nyou listen to it with focus and devotion.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The purpose of mant=\r\nra is to control the mind and its thoughts and tap some spiritual energy th=\r\nat the mind has access to but does not get because of its various pre-occup=\r\nations. If you hear something with focus, it still helps in controlling the=\r\n mind, tapping some spiritual energy. It is still beneficial.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n However, as you become comfortable with it, try to chant it yourself at so=\r\nme stage. That is a little better.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) Yes. As you hear, a pa=\r\nrt of your mind is repeating that sound while you do the actions. It will s=\r\ntill be beneficial. In fact, I know that some people who are now doing homa=\r\nm quite well started out in that manner!\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) You will benefit=\r\n mainly. But various people who enabled you will also get some small portio=\r\nns of it.
