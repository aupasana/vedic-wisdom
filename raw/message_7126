You have mentioned somewhere that Manishji was inspire=\r\nd from Mother to startHomam daily. I would like to know whether it was for =\r\nMaha Ganapati Homam too or onlyChandi Homam?\nA.\nThe instruction was to spre=\r\nad homam and create a community of sadhakas across the world whoworship var=\r\nious deities in fire. It can be any deities.\n\nWhile this is what I see  in =\r\nalmost all the homam manuals.\n\n-----\n\nMy spiritual master Dr Manish Pandit =\r\nhails from Pune, India and lives in Manchester, UK. The idea of spreading h=\r\nomam in the world was revealed to him in a dream a few years ago. He saw ei=\r\nght elevated beings in a dream. They transported him across blue skies to C=\r\nhennai, India, where he was shown the big fire that was to be lighted in fu=\r\nture.\n\n-----------\n\nMy understanding was Manish ji was preparing for sAdhak=\r\nas who will start with their deities and move up to Chandi homam to be done=\r\n at a time in future (the big fire being lighted). That is one of the reaso=\r\nns, I started to do Chandi homam in the weekends; else I would stick to my =\r\ndeity LordKrsna all the time. \n\nSh Narasimha or someone - Could one of you =\r\nplease confirm this again ?\n\nregards\nrAma\n\n\n"}}
