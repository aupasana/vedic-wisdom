It was ten years later, in 1927, that I went to Tiruvannamalai in=\r\n\nthe company of three ladies. When I went to Ramanasramam, Bhagavan was\nsea=\r\nted on a cot in a grass-thatched shed. As soon as I saw him I knew that\nhe =\r\nwas God in human form. Muruganar, who was a native of Ramnad like me, was\nb=\r\ny his side. I bowed to Bhagavan and said, &quot;Today I am blessed. Please grant=\r\n\nthat my mind does not trouble me any more&quot;. Bhagavan turned to Muruganar a=\r\nnd\nsaid, &quot;Ask her to find out whether there is such a thing as mind. If the=\r\nre\nis, ask her to describe it&quot;. I stood still, not knowing what to say.\nMur=\r\nuganar explained to me, &quot;Don&#39;t you see? You have been initiated in the\nsear=\r\nch for the Self.\n\nWe stayed for forty days. We would cook some food, and ta=\r\nke it to the\nAshram.Bhagavan would taste it and the rest was given to the d=\r\nevotees. In\nthose days, Bhagavan&#39;s brother Chinnaswami was cooking in the A=\r\nshram. Often\nthere were no curries or sambar, only plain rice and pickles. =\r\nThough I\nwanted to stay on until Bhagavan&#39;s birthday, my companions had to =\r\nleave.\nWhen I went to Bhagavan to take his leave, He asked me to wait a day=\r\n longer\nfor the newly printed Upadesa Saram . The next day he gave me a cop=\r\ny with\nhis own hands. The thought of leaving him broke my heart and I wept\n=\r\nbitterly. Bhagavan graciously said, &quot;You are going to Ramnad, but you are\nn=\r\not leaving Arunachala. Go and come soon&quot;.\n\nBhagavan used to be active worki=\r\nng both in the kitchen and outside.He would\nclean grain, shell nuts, grind =\r\nseeds, stick together the leaf plates we ate\nfrom and so on. We would join =\r\nhim in every task and listen to his stories,\njokes, reminiscences and spiri=\r\ntual teachings. Occasionally he would scold us\nlovingly like a mother. Ever=\r\nything we did, every problem we faced, was made\nuse of in teaching the art =\r\nof total reliance on him.\n\nThe European\n\nOne morning a European came in a h=\r\norse carriage to the Ashram and went\nstraight to Bhagavan. He wrote somethi=\r\nng on a piece of paper and showed it\nto Bhagavan. Bhagavan did not answer, =\r\ninstead he gazed at the stranger\nsteadily. The stranger stared back at him.=\r\n Then Bhagavan closed his eyes and\nthe stranger also closed his. Time passe=\r\nd and the whole atmosphere was\nsilent and still. Lunch hour struck but Bhag=\r\navan would not open his eyes.\nMadhavaswami, the attendant, got Bhagavan&#39;s w=\r\nater pot and stood ready to\nlead him out of the hall. Bhagavan would not st=\r\nir. We felt afraid to go\nnear, such was the intensity around him. His face =\r\nwas glowing with a strange\nlight. Chinnaswami was talking loudly to attract=\r\n Bhagavan&#39;s attention. Even\nvessels were banged about, but all in vain. Whe=\r\nn the clock was striking\ntwelve Bhagavan opened his eyes. They were glowing=\r\n very brightly.\nMadhavaswami took up the water jug; the European got into t=\r\nhe carriage and\nwent away. It was the last we saw of him. Everybody was won=\r\nderstruck at the\ngreat good fortune of the man, to have received such immed=\r\niate initiation\nfrom Bhagavan.\n\nMaharaja of Mysore\n\nOnce the Maharaja of My=\r\nsore visited the Ashram. He asked for a private\ninterview. Of course, Bhaga=\r\nvan never allowed such a thing. Finally it was\ndecided that Maharaja be bro=\r\nught in when Bhagavan was having his bath. Trays\nand trays of sweets and ot=\r\nher costly presents were laid at Bhagavan&#39;s feet.\nFor ten minutes the Mahar=\r\naja just stood looking and then prostrated before\nBhagavan. Tears flowing f=\r\nrom his eyes made Bhagavan&#39;s feet wet. He told\nBhagavan, &quot;They made me a Ma=\r\nharaja and bound me to a throne. For the sin of\nbeing born a king, I lost t=\r\nhe chance of sitting at your feet and serving in\nyour glorious presence. I =\r\ndo not hope to come again. Only these few minutes\nare mine. I pray for your=\r\n grace&quot;.\n\nThe Harijan\n\nIn the early days of the Ashram, a harijan used to s=\r\ntand near the well and\naccompany Bhagavan whenever he went up the hill. One=\r\n day Bhagavan called him\nnear and said, &quot;Go on repeating `Shiva, Shiva&#39;&quot;. I=\r\nt was very unusual for an\nuntouchable to receive this kind of initiation. H=\r\ne could never have secured\nit without Bhagavan&#39;s infinite grace. After that=\r\n the man disappeared.\n\nKitchen and other stories\n\nA visitor while taking le=\r\nave of Bhagavan expressed a wish that Bhagavan\nshould keep him in mind as h=\r\ne was going very far away and would probably not\ncome back to the Ashram. B=\r\nhagavan replied:\n\nA jnani has no mind. How can one without a mind remember =\r\nor even think? This\nman goes somewhere and I have to go there and look afte=\r\nr him? Can I keep on\nremembering all these prayers? Well, I shall transmit =\r\nyour prayer to the\nLord of the Universe. He will look after you. It is his =\r\nbusiness.\n\nAfter the devotee departed, Bhagavan turned towards us and said:=\r\n\n\nPeople imagine that the devotees crowding around a jnani [?] get special\n=\r\nfavours from him. If a Guru shows partiality, how can he be a jnani? Is he\n=\r\nso foolish as to be flattered by people&#39;s attendance on him and the service=\r\n\nthey do? Does distance matter? The Guru is pleased with him only who gives=\r\n\nhimself up entirely, who abandons his ego forever. Such a man is taken car=\r\ne\nof wherever he may be. He need not pray. God looks after him unasked. The=\r\n\nfrog lives by the side of the fragrant lotus, but it is the bee that gets\n=\r\nthe honey.\n\nOne day, when I was still new in the kitchen, I served Bhagavan=\r\n with a few\nmore pieces of potato than the rest. Bhagavan noticed it and go=\r\nt very angry\nwith me. He turned his face away and did not look at those who=\r\n were serving\nfood. In the evening the women working in the kitchen would t=\r\nake leave of\nhim. Usually he would exchange a few words with us. That eveni=\r\nng he called\nme near and asked:\n\n&quot;What did you do today&quot;?\n\n&quot;I don&#39;t know Bh=\r\nagavan. Have I done something wrong&quot;?\n\n&quot;You served me more curry than you s=\r\nerved others&quot;.\n\n&quot;What does it matter. I did it with love and devotion&quot;.\n\n&quot;I=\r\n felt ashamed to eat more than others. Have you come all this way to stuff\n=\r\nme with food? You should always serve me less than the others. Do you hope\n=\r\nto earn grace through a potato curry&quot;?\n\n&quot;Out of my love for you I committed=\r\n a blunder. Forgive me Bhagavan&quot;.\n\n&quot;The more you love my people, the more y=\r\nou love me&quot;, said Bhagavan.\n\nSource:\nhttp://ramana-smriti.blogspot.com/2007=\r\n/07/eternal-bhagavan-shantammal.html\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=\r\n=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =\r\n=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=\r\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--001636b2b1623065d9048807414f\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_q=\r\nuote&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\ncolor:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nfont-weight:bold&quot;&gt;MY search for a Master who would lead me to salvation beg=\r\nan when I was 40 years old.=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;It was ten years later, in 1927, th=\r\nat I went to Tiruvannamalai in the company of three ladies.=C2=A0&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;When I went to Ramanasramam, Bhagavan was seated on =\r\na cot in a grass-thatched shed.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0As soon as I saw him I knew tha=\r\nt he was God in human form.
