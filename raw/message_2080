Consequently we start emulating\nthem, t=\r\nhus changing ourselves for the better.\n\n*Spiritual Benefits\n*- Increase in =\r\nhumility and reduction of ego / Enhancement in the spiritual\nemotion of sur=\r\nrender and gratitude / Gaining the Sattva component and faster\nspiritual pr=\r\nogress\nWe receive the highest amount of Sattva component from the posture (=\r\nmudra)\nof Namaskar.\nBy  doing Namaskar to Deities or Saints we receive subt=\r\nle frequencies\nemitted by them, e.g. frequencies of Sattva or Bliss.\n\n\n*Why=\r\n is it not appropriate to Shake Hands?*\n\n\n*Avoid a Hand Shake:* It tranfers=\r\n undesirable raja-tama components! In\nshort, in a handshake, the raja-tama =\r\ncomponents in one person will get\ntransferred to the other person, thereby =\r\nlowering his sattvikta (Purity\nlevels). While practicing Spirituality, our =\r\nobjective is to perform acts\nwhich increase our sattvikta.\nIf at all they d=\r\no Namaskar by joining their palms, it is done just as a\nformality. As the a=\r\nct is not based on faith, the benefit derived from it is\nminimal. Along wit=\r\nh faith it is essential that every religious act be\ncorrectly performed acc=\r\nording to the Science of Spirituality, so that it\ngives complete benefit. I=\r\nn this series, as with the others,  along with\ninformation on various metho=\r\nds of doing Namaskar, the Science in them is\nalso explained. Understanding =\r\nthe Science will help in strengthening faith\nin the act. Such an act correc=\r\ntly performed with faith, will yield\ncorresponding benefits.\n\n\n*How does on=\r\ne do Namaskar to an individual of the same age group?*\n\nWhen meeting someon=\r\ne of the same age-groupdo Namaskar by joining the fingers\nand placing tips =\r\nof the thumbs on the Anahat chakra (at the centre of the\nchest). This type =\r\nof Namaskarincreases the spiritual emotion of humility in\nthe embodied soul=\r\n. Sattva frequencies from the universe are attracted by the\nfingers (which =\r\nact as an antenna) and are then transmitted to the entire\nbody through the =\r\nthumbs which have awakened the Anahat chakra. This\nactivates the soul energ=\r\ny of the embodied soul. In addition, by doing\nNamaskar in this manner to ea=\r\nch other, frequencies of blessings are also\ntransmitted.\n\n\n*What is correct=\r\n method & science of doing Namaskar to God?*\n\n\n*A.* &#39;While paying obeisance=\r\n to God, bring the palms together.\n*1.* The fingers should be held loose (n=\r\not straight and rigid) while joining\nthe hands or palms.\n*2.* The fingers s=\r\nhould be kept close to each other without leaving any\nspace between them.\n*=\r\n3.* The fingers should be kept away from the thumbs.\n*4.* The inner portion=\r\n of the palms should not touch each other and there\nshould be some space be=\r\ntween them.\n\n*Note:* The stage of awakening of spiritual emotion (Bhav) is =\r\nimportant to\nthe seeker at the primary level. Hence, for awakening spiritua=\r\nl emotion\n(Bhav), he should keep space in between the joined hands, whereas=\r\n a seeker\nwho is at the advanced level should refrain from leaving such spa=\r\nce in\nbetween the palms to awaken the unexpressed spiritual emotion (Bhav).=\r\n\n\n*B.* After joining the hands one should bow and bring the head forward..\n=\r\n\n*C.* While tilting the headforward, one should place the thumbs at the\nmid=\r\n-brow region, i.e. at the point between the eyebrows and try to\nconcentrate=\r\n on the feet of the Deity.\n\n*D.* After that, instead of bringing the folded=\r\n hands down immediately, they\nshould be placed on the mid-chest region for =\r\na minute in such way that the\nwrists touch the chest; then only  should the=\r\n hands be brought down.\n\n*Underlying Science in this action*\n\n\n*A.* The fin=\r\ngers should not be stiff while bringing the palms together\nbecause this wil=\r\nl lead to a decrease in Sattva component from the vital and\nmental sheaths =\r\nand thus increase the raja component in them. By keeping the\nfingers relaxe=\r\nd, the subtlest Sattva component will get activated. With the\nstrength of t=\r\nhis energy, embodied souls are able to fight powerful\ndistressing energies.=\r\n\n\n*B.* In the Namaskar posture, the joined fingers act as an antenna to\nass=\r\nimilate the Chaitanya (Divine consciousness) or the Energy transmitted by\na=\r\n Deity. While joining the palms, the fingers must touch each other because\n=\r\nleaving space between the fingers will result in accumulation of energy in\n=\r\nthat space. This energy will be immediately transmitted in various\ndirectio=\r\nns;  therefore the seeker&#39;s body will lose the benefit of this\npotent energ=\r\ny.\n\n*C.* About the space to be maintained between the palms:\nFor a seeker a=\r\nt the primary level, it is advisable to leave space between\nthe palms; it i=\r\ns not necessary for a seeker at an advanced level to leave\nspace between th=\r\ne palms.\n\n*D.* After joining the palms, bow a little. This posture puts pre=\r\nssure on\nthe navel and activates the five vital energies situated there. Ac=\r\ntivation\nof these vital energies in the body makes it sensitive to acceptin=\r\ng sattvik\nfrequencies. This later awakens the &#39;Atma shakti&#39;  (i.e. soul ene=\r\nrgy of an\nembodied soul). And later, Bhav is awakened. This enables the bod=\r\ny to accept\nin large measures the Chaitanya emitted by the Deity.\n\n*E.* Tou=\r\nch the thumbs to the mid-brow region. (Please see images above..)\nThis post=\r\nure awakens the Bhav of surrender in an embodied soul, and  in turn\nactivat=\r\nes the appropriate subtle frequencies of Deities from the Universe.\nThey en=\r\nter through the =92Adnya chakra=92 (Sixth of the 7 chakras in the\nKundalini=\r\n) of the embodied soul and settle in the space parallel to it at\nthe back i=\r\nnterior of the head. In this space the openings to all the three\nchannels c=\r\nonverge; namely, the Moon, the Central and the Sun channels. Due\nto the mov=\r\nement of these subtler frequencies in this space, the Central\nChannel is ac=\r\ntivated. Consequently it facilitates the speedy transmission of\nthese frequ=\r\nencies throughout the body, leading to purification of both the\ngross and s=\r\nubtle bodies at the same time.\n\n*F.* After doing Namaskar, to completely im=\r\nbibe the Chaitanya of the Deity\n(that has entered the hands by now), instea=\r\nd of bringing the folded hands\ndown immediately, place them on the mid-ches=\r\nt region in such a way that the\nwrists touch the chest.\n\nThe &#39;Anahat chakra=\r\n&#39; is located at the centre of the chest. Akin to the Adnya\nchakra, the acti=\r\nvity of the Anahat chakra is also to absorb the Sattva\nfrequencies. By touc=\r\nhing the wrists to the chest, the Anahat chakra is\nactivated and it helps i=\r\nn absorbing more of the Sattva component.\n\n\n*Effect of this Posture*\n\nBy do=\r\ning Namaskar in this manner, the Deity&#39;s Chaitanya is absorbed to a\ngreater=\r\n extent by the body, as compared to other methods of doing Namaskar.\nThis g=\r\nives maximum distress to negative energies. The negative energies that\nhave=\r\n manifested in a person are unable to touch their thumbs at the mid-brow\nre=\r\ngion in Namaskar. (The negative energies are subtle. But at times they\nente=\r\nr an individual&#39;s body and manifest it. - Editor)&#39;\n\n*Q. What is the reason =\r\nfor not wrapping a cloth around the neck while\nperforming circumambulation,=\r\n doing Namaskar, ritualistic worship,\nsacrificial fires, chanting and while=\r\n visiting Guru and deities?*\n\nA. When a cloth is wrapped around the neck, i=\r\nt does not activate the\nVishuddha chakra (in the throat region) and hence a=\r\nn individual gets less\nbenefit of the Sattva component.\n\n\n*Why should one a=\r\nlways do Namaskar to elders?*\n\n\n\n*Meaning:* When an elderly person arrives,=\r\n the vital energy of the young\nperson starts rising and when he gets up and=\r\n does Namaskar, it returns to\nnormal. - Manusmruti 2.120; Mahabharat, Udhyo=\r\ng, Chapter (Section) 38.1, Sr.\nno. 104, 64-65\n\n*Explanation:* &#39;As the sojou=\r\nrn of the elderly person is gradually towards\nthe southern direction, that =\r\nis, towards the region of Lord Yama (towards\ndeath), his body starts emitti=\r\nng raja and tama frequencies on a high scale.\nWhen such an elderly person c=\r\nomes in the vicinity of any younger individual,\nthese frequencies start aff=\r\necting the younger person. A subtle magnetic\nfield is created between the t=\r\nwo. Consequently, the vital energy of the\nyounger person is pulled upward. =\r\nThis way the younger person can suffer due\nto sudden momentum to his vital =\r\nenergy. When this younger person\ndoesNamaskar to the elderly person, some a=\r\nmount of the Central channel of\nhis Kundalini system is activated and the S=\r\nattva component in it starts\nincreasing. Consequently the raja and tama com=\r\nponents in him are influenced\nby the Sattva component and the vital energy =\r\ncomes back to normal state.\nHence on arrival of an elderly person, it is cu=\r\nstomary for the younger\nindividuals\n to do Namaskar to them.&#39;\n\n\nDoing Namas=\r\nkar to Elders.\n\n*When travelling, prior to the commencement of a journey an=\r\nd upon returning,\nwhy should one do Namaskar to elders in the family?\n*\n&#39;Na=\r\nmaskar to the elders in the family is one way of surrendering to the God\npr=\r\ninciple in them. When an embodied soul bows in Namaskar to an elder by\nsurr=\r\nendering to the God principle in him, at that time a sense of compassion\nis=\r\n created in his body. This compassion percolates right upto his subtle\nbody=\r\n. At that time, energy of his mind is activated and in turn activates\nthe f=\r\nive vital energies, which are located at the seat of the Manipur chakra\n(si=\r\ntuated in the Naval region). Transmission of these five vital energies\nall =\r\nover the body then awakens the soul energy. With the strength of the\nsoul e=\r\nnergy, the Central channel gets activated and converts the expressed\nenergy=\r\n of spiritual emotion to the unexpressed energy of spiritual emotion.\nWith =\r\nthe help of this unexpressed energy of spiritual emotion, the embodied\nsoul=\r\n, through the medium of elders, gains the required Deity&#39;s principle\nfrom t=\r\nhe Universe. For this purpose, while leaving the house on a\n journey, the e=\r\nmbodied soul should do Namaskar to elders and with the\nstrength of Sattva f=\r\nrequencies has to protect himself from distressing\nfrequencies in the atmos=\r\nphere. Similarly, returning from a journey, one\nshould immediately do Namas=\r\nkar to elders and awaken the God principle in\nthem, which would disintegrat=\r\ne the raja-tama particles from the air around\nhim, which might have been br=\r\nought along.\n\n\n*What is the correct method of doing Namaskar to Saints?*\n\n*=\r\n1. The portion of head, which should be placed at the feet :*\n\nWe can imbib=\r\ne maximum Chaitanya through the Brahmarandhra (the seventh\nchakra of the Ku=\r\nndalini system located in the crown of our head). Since it\n(Brahmarandhra) =\r\ncannot be placed at a Saints&#39;s feet, the part of head\nbeginning above the f=\r\norehead is to be placed at the feet of Saints. Due to\nthis, maximum Chaitan=\r\nya emanating from Their feet can enter into the one\ndoing Namaskar.\n\n*2. Th=\r\ne exact spot to place one&#39;s head on a Saint&#39;s feet:*\n\nThe big toes of Saint=\r\ns emit maximum Chaitanya; hence we should place our\nhead on the big toe, th=\r\nan on their foot. If we are in a position to touch\nboth the toes, then plac=\r\ne the head on the right big toe.\n\n*3. The position of hands when placing th=\r\ne head on a Saint&#39;s feet:*\n\n*a.* Some interlock their hands behind their ba=\r\ncks at the waist and do\nNamaskar. If we are in a position to touch both the=\r\nir toes, then we should\nplace the hands one on each foot and the head shoul=\r\nd be placed on the big\ntoe of the right foot. If we are in a position to to=\r\nuch one of Their toes,\nthen place both the hands on it and keep the head on=\r\n the big toe.\n\n*b.* Some do Namaskar by placing hands on the ground. This i=\r\ns also wrong\nbecause if the hands are placed on the ground then the Chaitan=\r\nya emanating\nfrom the Saint&#39;s feet are absorbed by one and then returns to =\r\nthe earth\nthrough the hands of the one doing Namaskar. Thus the person does=\r\n not\nbenefit from it.\n\n*c.* Some cross their hands and place them on the fe=\r\net of Saints, that is,\ntheir right hand on the right foot of the Saint and =\r\ntheir left hand on the\nleft foot of the Saint while doingNamaskar. This is =\r\na crude imitation of the\nmanner in which Christians place their crossed han=\r\nds on their chest.\nInstead, our right hand should be placed on the left foo=\r\nt of the Saint and\nour left hand on the right foot of the Saint. This is co=\r\nnvenient also.\nHowever, if a Guru has started some procedure in a particula=\r\nr sect, then the\nhands are to be placed in that manner only.\n\nd. The hands =\r\nare to be positioned in such a way that the palms are placed on\nthe feet..\n=\r\n\n\n*How to do Namaskar to the wooden footwear (paduka) of Saints?*\n\n\nNamaska=\r\nr to the wooden footwear (paduka) of Saints\n\n&#39;The left paduka symbolises Lo=\r\nrd Shiva and the right symbolises Divine\nEnergy. The left paduka is the unm=\r\nanifest saviour energy and the right is\nthe unmanifest destroyer energy of =\r\nthe Supreme God. The saviour or destroyer\nenergy of the Supreme God emanate=\r\ns from the &#39;pegs&#39; of the paduka as per the\nneed. When we do Namaskar by pla=\r\ncing our head on the &#39;pegs&#39; of the paduka,\nsome may experience distress due=\r\n to the inability to tolerate the manifest\nenergy emitting from it. Hence, =\r\nwhile doing Namaskar to the paduka, instead\nof the pegs, place the head on =\r\nthe foremost part i.e. the place where the\nSaints place their toes.&#39;\n\n\n*Sho=\r\nuld one do Namaskar to a dead body?\n*\n*Q. If this be so, should we do Namas=\r\nkar to the dead bodies in Kaliyuga only\nas a custom? If it is a custom, can=\r\n we discontinue it?\n*\nA. One can maintain respect for the dead person by do=\r\ning Namaskar and in\naddition set an ideal with regards to respecting elders=\r\n. In Kaliyuga, from\nthis one will benefit at an emotional level and not at =\r\na spiritual level.\nHowever, one should not discontinue this custom; instead=\r\n one could learn how\nto get spiritual benefit from it. Due to the deteriora=\r\ntion of the Sattva\ncomponent in embodied souls, this practice has become a =\r\nmere custom in\nKaliyuga.\n\nHowever, as per the saying, &#39;God exists where the=\r\nre is spiritual emotion&#39;,\nwhile doing Namaskar to a dead body if we have a =\r\nspiritual emotion that we\nare doing Namaskar  to the God principle in it, t=\r\nhen the God principle in\nthe dead body awakens and we receive God&#39;s blessin=\r\ngs. This happens because\nthe God principle is immortal and has no limitatio=\r\nns that a physical body\nhas.\n\n\n*Q. It is said that one should not do Namask=\r\nar to a sleeping person. In\nKaliyuga if one does Namaskar by touching the d=\r\nead body, then are the\nchances of getting distress from negative energies n=\r\not higher?\n*\nA. Yes it is; but while doing Namaskar it is important that th=\r\ne action be\nperformed with correct spiritual emotion. Since Namaskar is don=\r\ne to the God\nprinciple in the dead body instead of activating raja, tama co=\r\nmponents, it\nactivates the Godly principle in the dead body and bestows Sat=\r\ntva\ncorresponding to the degree of spiritual emotion.&#39;\n\n\n*&#39;One hand&#39; touch =\r\nto the Temple Steps\n*\n*Action: Touch the step with the fingers of the right=\r\n hand and move the same\nhand over the head.\n*\n*Science:* &#39;The area around t=\r\nhe temple is charged with frequencies of\nDeities which leads to an increase=\r\n in the Sattva component. The presence of\nDivine consciousness in the area =\r\ncharges even the stairs in a temple.\n&#39;Climbing&#39; steps is one of the activit=\r\nies, which increases the raja\ncomponent in the body. Hence, the raja compon=\r\nent is already activated in the\nbody of an embodied soul so by touching the=\r\n steps with the fingers of the\nright hand, the Sattva component and peace f=\r\nrom the charged premise, get\ntransmitted to the body through the right hand=\r\n. In addition, from this\naction, the activated raja component in the body c=\r\nan be controlled through\nthe medium of the surya nadi (Sun channel). This m=\r\neans that, for a moment,\nthe activities of the Sun channel can be stopped. =\r\nFrom this process, the\nembodied soul learns to enhance the Sattva component=\r\n through raja dominant\nactions. Therefore, it is very essential to perform =\r\nthe appropriate sattvik\nactions at\n each corresponding level, hence the met=\r\nhod of touching the steps with\nfingers of the right hand and then moving th=\r\ne fingers or palm over the head.\nEven the dust present on the steps is char=\r\nged with Chaitanya and so we must\nrespect it and derive spiritual benefit f=\r\nrom it. If the embodied soul\nharbours the spiritual emotion that &#39;the Chait=\r\nanya from the steps be\ntransmitted all over my body from the dust on my han=\r\nd&#39;, then it will give\nincreasing benefit to the embodied soul. In addition =\r\nif the ego of the\nembodied soul is less at that time then it gives even mor=\r\ne benefit. When any\naction is performed devoid of ego or &#39;I&#39;ness it is trea=\r\nted as a &#39;non-action&#39;\n(akarma-karma).&#39;\n\n\n\n*Do&#39;s and Dont&#39;s while doing Nama=\r\nskar\n*\n*Q. Why should the eyes be closed while doing Namaskar?\n*\n &#39;Joining =\r\nhands while bowing the head amounts to saluting God or the\ndivinity in the =\r\nperson in front. The eyes are closed while doing Namaskar to\nGod or any res=\r\npected person, to enable one to have the vision of God within\nus.&#39;\n\n*Q. Why=\r\n should the footwear be taken off while doing Namaskar?\n*\nWhile sitting, pa=\r\nrtaking meals, sleeping, wishing and doing Namaskar to\nGurus and other elde=\r\nrly people, footwear should not be worn. - Gautamsmruti\n9.\n\n1. Footwear inc=\r\nreases the raja-tama components in a person.\n\n2. Paying obeisance (Namaskar=\r\n) with high raja-tama components will not help\nin activating the Kundalini =\r\n(centre in the spiritual energy system).\n\n3. The ability to absorb the satt=\r\nva component too is reduced, due to an\nincrease in the raja-tama components=\r\n, leading to little benefit from a\nNamaskar.\n\n4. Doing Namaskar to a Deity,=\r\n with footwear on, may also invite the wrath of\nthe Deity.=92\n\n*Q. Why is i=\r\nt not advisable to hold any object while doing Namaskar?\n*\n1. While doing N=\r\namaskar if an object is held in the hands, usually the\nfingers and their ti=\r\nps are in a curled position and not straight. As a\nresult, the sattva compo=\r\nnent received is unable to enter the tips of the\nfingers.\n\n2. The sattva co=\r\nmponent emitted towards the seeker, strikes the object held\nand bounces bac=\r\nk. Also, at times, instead of the person absorbing the sattva\ncomponent, th=\r\ne object may absorb it.\n\n3. If the object in the hand is raja or tama predo=\r\nminant, and if it is\ntouched to the forehead or chest while doing Namaskar,=\r\n then the raja-tama\ncomponents from it mayenter the body of the one who is =\r\ndoing Namaskar.\n\n*Q. While doing Namaskar, why are men not supposed to cove=\r\nr their head,\nwhereas women are advised to cover their head?\n*\n One should =\r\nnot do Namaskar with footwear on, covering the head or holding\nany objects.=\r\n (But women should cover their head with their saris and only\nthen do Namas=\r\nkar) - Apastamb Dharmasutra 1.4.14.19\n\nWhile doing Namaskar the Kundalini g=\r\nets activated at the chakra which is\ntouched by the folded hands. This lead=\r\ns to the absorption of the Sattva\ncomponent in greater proportion in the bo=\r\ndy. Sometimes due to the activation\nof the Kundalini, Sattva component star=\r\nts entering the body through the\nhead. But at times the distressing energie=\r\ns try to take advantage of this\nand mix black energy with the Sattva compon=\r\nent. The potential to activate\nthe Kundalini is higher in men as compared t=\r\no women. Hence they are hardly\naffected by this negative energy. Contrary t=\r\no this, as women are more\nvulnerable, they get affected by distressing ener=\r\ngies to a greater extent\nand thus they can experience distress. That is why=\r\n, when doing Namaskar,\nwomen are advised to cover their head with the ends =\r\nof their sari. This\ncreates a barrier between the head and the distressing =\r\nenergies and prevents\nthemfrom penetrating the body of the woman. However, =\r\nto some extent this\nalso blocks\n benevolent frequencies from entering the w=\r\nomen.

This later awakens the &#39;Atma shakti&#39;=A0 (i.e. soul =\r\nenergy of an embodied soul). And later, Bhav is awakened. This enables the =\r\nbody to accept in large measures the Chaitanya emitted by the Deity.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR: red&quot;&gt;E.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;=A0Touch the thumbs to the mid=\r\n-brow region.

They enter through the =92Adn=\r\nya chakra=92 (Sixth of the 7 chakras in the Kundalini) of the embodied soul=\r\n and settle in the space parallel to it at the back interior of the head. I=\r\nn this space the openings to all the three channels converge; namely, the M=\r\noon, the Central and the Sun channels. Due to the movement of these subtler=\r\n frequencies in this space, the Central Channel is activated. Consequently =\r\nit facilitates the speedy transmission of these frequencies throughout the =\r\nbody, leading to purification of both the gross and subtle bodies at the sa=\r\nme time.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR: red&quot;&gt;F.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;=A0After doing =\r\nNamaskar, to completely imbibe the Chaitanya of the Deity (that has entered=\r\n the hands by now), instead of bringing the folded hands down immediately, =\r\nplace them on the mid-chest region in such a way that the wrists touch the =\r\nchest.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;The &#39;Anahat chakra&#39; is located at the centre of the =\r\nchest. Akin to the Adnya chakra, the activity of the Anahat chakra is also =\r\nto absorb the Sattva frequencies. By touching the wrists to the chest, the =\r\nAnahat chakra is activated and it helps in absorbing more of the Sattva com=\r\nponent.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR: blue&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE=\r\n: 12pt&quot;&gt;Effect of this Posture&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;By doing Namaskar i=\r\nn this manner, the Deity&#39;s Chaitanya is absorbed to a greater extent by=\r\n the body, as compared to other methods of doing Namaskar.

When such an elderly person comes in the vicinity of any younger indiv=\r\nidual, these frequencies start affecting the younger person. A subtle magne=\r\ntic field is created between the two. Consequently, the vital energy of the=\r\n younger person is pulled upward. This way the younger person can suffer du=\r\ne to sudden momentum to his vital energy. When this younger person doesNama=\r\nskar to the elderly person, some amount of the Central channel of his Kunda=\r\nlini system is activated and the Sattva component in it starts increasing. =\r\nConsequently the raja and tama components in him are influenced by the Satt=\r\nva component and the vital energy comes back to normal state. Hence on arri=\r\nval of an elderly person, it is customary for the younger individuals&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n=A0to do Namaskar to them.&#39;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;img src=3D&quot;http://www.hindujagru=\r\nti.org/hinduism/knowledge/out/images/1181062805_namaskar_to_elders.jpg&quot; bor=\r\nder=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;Doing Namaskar to Elders.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR: blu=\r\ne&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt&quot;&gt;When travelling, prior to the commenceme=\r\nnt of a journey and upon returning, why should one do Namaskar to elders in=\r\n the family?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&#39;Namaskar to the elders in the f=\r\namily is one way of surrendering to the God principle in them. When an embo=\r\ndied soul bows in Namaskar to an elder by surrendering to the God principle=\r\n in him, at that time a sense of compassion is created in his body. This co=\r\nmpassion percolates right upto his subtle body. At that time, energy of his=\r\n mind is activated and in turn activates the five vital energies, which are=\r\n located at the seat of the Manipur chakra (situated in the Naval region). =\r\nTransmission of these five vital energies all over the body then awakens th=\r\ne soul energy. With the strength of the soul energy, the Central channel ge=\r\nts activated and converts the expressed energy of spiritual emotion to the =\r\nunexpressed energy of spiritual emotion. With the help of this unexpressed =\r\nenergy of spiritual emotion, the embodied soul, through the medium of elder=\r\ns, gains the required Deity&#39;s principle from the Universe. For this pur=\r\npose, while leaving the house on a&lt;br&gt;\n=A0journey, the embodied soul should=\r\n do Namaskar to elders and with the strength of Sattva frequencies has to p=\r\nrotect himself from distressing frequencies in the atmosphere. Similarly, r=\r\neturning from a journey, one should immediately do Namaskar to elders and a=\r\nwaken the God principle in them, which would disintegrate the raja-tama par=\r\nticles from the air around him, which might have been brought along.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR: blue&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;What i=\r\ns the correct method of doing Namaskar to Saints?&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;b&gt;1. The portion of head, which should be placed at the feet :&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\nWe can imbibe maximum Chaitanya through the Brahmarandhra (the seventh cha=\r\nkra of the Kundalini system located in the crown of our head). Since it (Br=\r\nahmarandhra) cannot be placed at a Saints&#39;s feet, the part of head begi=\r\nnning above the forehead is to be placed at the feet of Saints. Due to this=\r\n, maximum Chaitanya emanating from Their feet can enter into the one doing =\r\nNamaskar.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;2. The exact spot to place one&#39;s head on a Saint&#=\r\n39;s feet:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The big toes of Saints emit maximum Chaitanya; hence =\r\nwe should place our head on the big toe, than on their foot. If we are in a=\r\n position to touch both the toes, then place the head on the right big toe.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;3.

The left paduka is the unmanifest saviour energy and the right =\r\nis the unmanifest destroyer energy of the Supreme God. The saviour or destr=\r\noyer energy of the Supreme God emanates from the &#39;pegs&#39; of the padu=\r\nka as per the need. When we do Namaskar by placing our head on the &#39;peg=\r\ns&#39; of the paduka, some may experience distress due to the inability to =\r\ntolerate the manifest energy emitting from it. Hence, while doing Namaskar =\r\nto the paduka, instead of the pegs, place the head on the foremost part i.e=\r\n. the place where the Saints place their toes.&#39;=A0&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span=\r\n style=3D&quot;COLOR: blue&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;Should one do Namask=\r\nar to a dead body?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q. If this be so, should we =\r\ndo Namaskar to the dead bodies in Kaliyuga only as a custom? If it is a cus=\r\ntom, can we discontinue it?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;A. One can maintain respect for the=\r\n dead person by doing Namaskar and in addition set an ideal with regards to=\r\n respecting elders. In Kaliyuga, from this one will benefit at an emotional=\r\n level and not at a spiritual level. However, one should not discontinue th=\r\nis custom; instead one could learn how to get spiritual benefit from it. Du=\r\ne to the deterioration of the Sattva component in embodied souls, this prac=\r\ntice has become a mere custom in Kaliyuga.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;However, as per the sayi=\r\nng, &#39;God exists where there is spiritual emotion&#39;, while doing Nama=\r\nskar to a dead body if we have a spiritual emotion that we are doing Namask=\r\nar=A0 to the God principle in it, then the God principle in the dead body a=\r\nwakens and we receive God&#39;s blessings. This happens because the God pri=\r\nnciple is immortal and has no limitations that a physical body has.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q. It is said that one should not do Namaskar to a sleeping person.=\r\n In Kaliyuga if one does Namaskar by touching the dead body, then are the c=\r\nhances of getting distress from negative energies not higher?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nA=\r\n. Yes it is; but while doing Namaskar it is important that the action be pe=\r\nrformed with correct spiritual emotion. Since Namaskar is done to the God p=\r\nrinciple in the dead body instead of activating raja, tama components, it a=\r\nctivates the Godly principle in the dead body and bestows Sattva correspond=\r\ning to the degree of spiritual emotion.&#39;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nCOLOR: blue&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;&#39;One hand&#39; touch to th=\r\ne Temple Steps&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Action: Touch the step with the =\r\nfingers of the right hand and move the same hand over the head.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;b&gt;Science:&lt;/b&gt;=A0&#39;The area around the temple is charged with frequenc=\r\nies of Deities which leads to an increase in the Sattva component. The pres=\r\nence of Divine consciousness in the area charges even the stairs in a templ=\r\ne. &#39;Climbing&#39; steps is one of the activities, which increases the r=\r\naja component in the body. Hence, the raja component is already activated i=\r\nn the body of an embodied soul so by touching the steps with the fingers of=\r\n the right hand, the Sattva component and peace from the charged premise, g=\r\net transmitted to the body through the right hand. In addition, from this a=\r\nction, the activated raja component in the body can be controlled through t=\r\nhe medium of the surya nadi (Sun channel). This means that, for a moment, t=\r\nhe activities of the Sun channel can be stopped. From this process, the emb=\r\nodied soul learns to enhance the Sattva component through raja dominant act=\r\nions. Therefore, it is very essential to perform the appropriate sattvik ac=\r\ntions at&lt;br&gt;\n=A0each corresponding level, hence the method of touching the =\r\nsteps with fingers of the right hand and then moving the fingers or palm ov=\r\ner the head. Even the dust present on the steps is charged with Chaitanya a=\r\nnd so we must respect it and derive spiritual benefit from it. If the embod=\r\nied soul harbours the spiritual emotion that &#39;the Chaitanya from the st=\r\neps be transmitted all over my body from the dust on my hand&#39;, then it =\r\nwill give increasing benefit to the embodied soul. In addition if the ego o=\r\nf the embodied soul is less at that time then it gives even more benefit. W=\r\nhen any action is performed devoid of ego or &#39;I&#39;ness it is treated =\r\nas a &#39;non-action&#39; (akarma-karma).&#39;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;COLOR: blue&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 12pt&quot;&gt;Do&#39;s and Dont&#39;s =\r\nwhile doing Namaskar&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q. Why should the eyes be =\r\nclosed while doing Namaskar?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;=A0&#39;Joining hands while bowing =\r\nthe head amounts to saluting God or the divinity in the person in front. Th=\r\ne eyes are closed while doing Namaskar to God or any respected person, to e=\r\nnable one to have the vision of God within us.&#39;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q. Why shoul=\r\nd the footwear be taken off while doing Namaskar?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;While sitting,=\r\n partaking meals, sleeping, wishing and doing Namaskar to Gurus and other e=\r\nlderly people, footwear should not be worn. - Gautamsmruti 9.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;1. Fo=\r\notwear increases the raja-tama components in a person.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2. Paying obe=\r\nisance (Namaskar) with high raja-tama components will not help in activatin=\r\ng the Kundalini (centre in the spiritual energy system).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n3. The abi=\r\nlity to absorb the sattva component too is reduced, due to an increase in t=\r\nhe raja-tama components, leading to little benefit from a Namaskar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n4. Doing Namaskar to a Deity, with footwear on, may also invite the wrath o=\r\nf the Deity.=92&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q. Why is it not advisable to hold any object wh=\r\nile doing Namaskar?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. While doing Namaskar if an object is held=\r\n in the hands, usually the fingers and their tips are in a curled position =\r\nand not straight. As a result, the sattva component received is unable to e=\r\nnter the tips of the fingers.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;2. The sattva component emitted towar=\r\nds the seeker, strikes the object held and bounces back. Also, at times, in=\r\nstead of the person absorbing the sattva component, the object may absorb i=\r\nt.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;3. If the object in the hand is raja or tama predominant, and if =\r\nit is touched to the forehead or chest while doing Namaskar, then the raja-=\r\ntama components from it mayenter the body of the one who is doing Namaskar.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;Q. While doing Namaskar, why are men not supposed to cover thei=\r\nr head, whereas women are advised to cover their head?&lt;br&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;=A0One sh=\r\nould not do Namaskar with footwear on, covering the head or holding any obj=\r\nects. (But women should cover their head with their saris and only then do =\r\nNamaskar) - Apastamb Dharmasutra 1.4.14.19&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;While doing Namaskar the=\r\n Kundalini gets activated at the chakra which is touched by the folded hand=\r\ns. This leads to the absorption of the Sattva component in greater proporti=\r\non in the body. Sometimes due to the activation of the Kundalini, Sattva co=\r\nmponent starts entering the body through the head. But at times the distres=\r\nsing energies try to take advantage of this and mix black energy with the S=\r\nattva component. The potential to activate the Kundalini is higher in men a=\r\ns compared to women. Hence they are hardly affected by this negative energy=\r\n. Contrary to this, as women are more vulnerable, they get affected by dist=\r\nressing energies to a greater extent and thus they can experience distress.=\r\n That is why, when doing Namaskar, women are advised to cover their head wi=\r\nth the ends of their sari. This creates a barrier between the head and the =\r\ndistressing energies and prevents themfrom penetrating the body of the woma=\r\nn. However, to some extent this also blocks&lt;br&gt;\n=A0benevolent frequencies f=\r\nrom entering the women. (Benevolent frequencies are subtler than negative f=\r\nrequencies; hence they enter a woman to some extent even though the sari co=\r\nvers her head.) However, the proper posture of Namaskar gives maximum Sattv=\r\na component to an individual and hence women too get required benefits. Thi=\r\ns shows how God takes care of every devotee. Doing Namaskar without these r=\r\nestrictions is equally effective if the devotee does it with spiritual emot=\r\nion.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Source -=A0&lt;a style=3D&quot;COLOR: rgb(71,108,142); TEXT-DECORATION=\r\n: none&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.hindujagruti.org/hinduism/knowledge/category/nam=\r\naskar&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.hindujagruti.org/hinduism/knowledge/cat=\r\negory/namaskar&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR: rgb(153,50,204)&quot;&gt;&lt;span =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 11pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\r\n--0016360e3d18b405a3046db083ed--\r\n\n"}}
