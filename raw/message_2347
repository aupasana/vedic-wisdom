Several materials can be offered in fire, including sesame seeds etc, but the most perfect offering is &quot;paayasa sikta darbha&quot;, i.e. dried sacred grass dipped in a rice pudding made of rice, milk, ghee and jaggery. The best samidha (wood) for this homam is that of Bilva tree (Aegle Marmelos), also known in Hindi as Bel tree. \n \nThis homam is performed for avoiding death and solving serious health problems.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThough I have been blessed to be able to meet a few outstanding priests in this life, it is my well-considered opinion that most priests today are incapable of achieving specific results through rituals. Priests who realized god and accumulated shakti through a pure lifestyle could in the past achieve specific results by channeling their shakti through specific rituals. It is the priest&#39;s shakti that gave the result by using the ritual as an instrument of expression. Such priests are a rarity today. No wonder slowly people are losing faith in rituals.\n \nThe best option for most people today is individual sadhana and begging god for a result they want.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRegarding the homam manuals on my website:\n \nI am acting on the Divine Mother&#39;s instruction to my guru to create a community of people who worship various deities in fire everyday using very simple procedures.\n \nIf you can volunteer to help Nature by performing a homam everyday or every weekend and surrendering the result of the homam to Nature, please use the manuals and perform a homam. For maintaining dharma in the universe, Nature at this time needs more sadhakas like that and that is why Divine Mother instructed my guru to create a community of such sadhakas.\n \nIf you volunteer, it is almost certain that Nature will also help you by giving you what you need (as opposed to what you *think* you need) for progressing in your life.\n \nIf you have a deep desire like your son&#39;s health, it is ok to keep the desire in mind and do a homam. But, instead of saying it explicitly in the sankalpa like people do, let the sankalpa just state that you are doing it just for the pleasure of so and so deity (as opposed to doing it for so and so results). Do it everyday or every weekend for 2-3 years and see what it does in your life!\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe Shiva homam manual you refer to gives several options, including Mrityunjaya mantra and also a variation of it with samputikarana. Because the manual offers several options - mantras to various forms of Shiva and not just Mrityunjaya, I just called it Shiva homam. Shiva means &quot;auspicious one&quot;. If you call Shiva or Sadashiva in fire, it is fine to offer mantras of different forms of Shiva in fire!\n \nMy recommendation is to pick any ONE mantra from all the options in the manual and offer that mantra in fire as many times as one can, everyday or every weekend.\n \nIf you are good at chanting Atharva seersham, my strong recommendation would be to do Ganapathi homam with several repetitions of Atharva seersham everyday for a few months. Switch to Shiva homam after a few months of regular Ganapathi homam. That will safeguard your material interests better.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- aashish rai &lt;raiaashish@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Mr. Balasubramanian,\n&gt; Please forgive my ignorance as I have no idea about Homam. I am a religious person do my japam&#39;s regularly. On special occasions I do 108 Atharvashirsa japams.   We don&#39;t have access to learned Vedic acharya&#39;s in Orissa.  After going thru Narasimhaji&#39;s mail I thought of doing Homam. And the curiosity of doing Shiva homam as he has mentioned in the Shiva Homam can reduce Physical suffering.\n&gt; \n&gt; So can you please elaborate Mritunjaya Mantra Homam as it&#39;s not in Narasimhaji&#39;s list.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Aashish \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt; From: G Balasubramanian &lt;gbsub@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Wednesday, 26 August, 2009 4:55:54 PM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Shiva Homam - calrification\n&gt; \n&gt; We generally call this as Rudra Homam and not as Shiva Homam.
