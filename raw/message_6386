T=\r\nhis truth is forgotten and the play of Satan in the human brain has been at=\r\n present in the stage of foolish ratiocination and comfortable argumentatio=\r\nn. While living in the sensual plane of life, an intelligent exposition of =\r\nAcosmism and Absolute Idealism in attractive rhetorical language cannot pas=\r\ns for more than a childish prattle. Dreams of bringing God to the sensual e=\r\narth are nothing but the exhibition of human vanity which is the outcome of=\r\n his failure in distinguishing between what is really true and existent and=\r\n what is not. \n\n\n"}}
