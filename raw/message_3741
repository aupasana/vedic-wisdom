Tidiness, cleanliness,thrift=\r\n\nand punctuality were expected from everyone. Arthur Osborne remarked,\n=E2=\r\n=80=9CBhagavan Sri Ramana was meticulously exact,closely observant, practic=\r\nal and\nhumorous. In everything he was precise and orderly. The Ashram Hall =\r\nwas\nswept out several times daily. The books were always in their places. T=\r\nhe\ncloths covering the couch were scrupulously clean and beautifully folded=\r\n.\nThe loin-cloth, which was all he wore,was gleaming white. The two clocks =\r\nin\nthe Hall were adjusted daily to radio time. The calendar was never allow=\r\ned\nto fall behind the date. The routine of life flowed to a regular pattern=\r\n.=E2=80=9D\n\nIn the later years, when Ramana had ceased working in the kitch=\r\nen and had\nstarted to supervise the building projects, his timetable was as=\r\n follows - he\nwould rise at approximately 3.30 a.m., at half past five he t=\r\nook his bath\nand at half past six breakfast was served.This was followed by=\r\n the first\nwalk on the hill. At 8.30 he read the incoming mail and at 9.45 =\r\nhe made a\nshort visit to the cowshed.Lunch was served at 11.30. Around midd=\r\nay he went\nfor a second walk, which this time lasted an hour and took him t=\r\no Palakothu.\nAt 2.30 p.m. there was coffee and at approximately 4 p.m. he r=\r\nead the\noutgoing mail. Half an hour later he again went for a walk for an h=\r\nour.\nAfter this the Veda parayana was chanted, followed by the Tamil paraya=\r\nna. At\nhalf past seven the bell called everyone to dinner.Afterwards Ramana=\r\n went to\nthe cowshed again and at 8.45 p.m. all devotees retired to their l=\r\nodgings.\n\nIt is reported that Sri Ramana slept very little at night. He als=\r\no never lay\ndown flat, but remained upright, leaning against the back of th=\r\ne couch.\nAfter lunch everyone in the Ashram liked to withdraw to take a nap=\r\n =E2=80=93 not so\nRamana. He often made use of this quiet hour to feed the =\r\nanimals or make a\nround through the Ashram and inform himself of the progre=\r\nss of the building\nprojects.\n\nIn spite of the increasing numbers of visitor=\r\ns Sri Ramana led an active\nlife. In addition to cooking and supervising the=\r\n building projects,he read\nthe proofs of the books which were to be publish=\r\ned.By now his works had been\ntranslated and printed in a number of Indian d=\r\nialects. He had written his\nfamous hymns to Arunachala around 1914. From 19=\r\n23 to 1929 he wrote Upadesa\nSaram (The Essence of Instruction in 30 Verses)=\r\n, Upadesa Manjari (Spiritual\nInstruction) and Ulladu Narpadu (Reality in Fo=\r\nrty Verses) with supplementary\nverses. This was followed in the thirties an=\r\nd forties by various\ntranslations into Tamil, Malayam and Telugu of importa=\r\nnt advaita scriptures,\nsuch as certain parts of Vivekachudamani and other s=\r\ncriptures by Shankara,\nsome verses of the Bhagavad Gita and parts of Yoga V=\r\nasishta and the Agamas.\nThe English translations of all these works can be =\r\nfound in =E2=80=98The Collected\nWorks of Ramana Maharshi=E2=80=99. So Raman=\r\na regularly spent a lot of time\nproof-reading these publications. He also r=\r\nead everything that was written\nabout him and was very particular that ever=\r\nything should be accurate.When a\nbiography was to be published about him in=\r\n Telugu, entitled =E2=80=98Ramana Leela=E2=80=99,\nhe painstakingly went thr=\r\nough it correcting any mistakes.\n\nHe also did bookbinding work. Now and the=\r\nn people would bring him old books\nin poor condition. He checked whether th=\r\ney were complete, added any missing\npages by copying them out himself and i=\r\nnserting them, and then repaired the\nbooks.\n\nJust as he never wasted any fo=\r\nod, so he also never wasted any paper.He would\ncollect any paper which was =\r\nstill usable, often cutting it up into small\nsheets, which he would then bi=\r\nnd together to make notebooks. Even the pins\nfrom the newspapers would be k=\r\nept. =E2=80=9CThey will otherwise be merely thrown\naway. We shall use them.=\r\n How should we get new ones? They have to be\nbought.Where is the money?=E2=\r\n=80=9D, he would say.\n\nIn the early years Sri Ramana attempted on a couple =\r\nof occasions to leave\nthe Ashram for a life of solitude. Vasudeva (the same=\r\n who once witnessed\nRamana=E2=80=99s second death experience at Tortoise ro=\r\nck) relates, =E2=80=9COnce Bhagavan\nand I went round the hill during the Sk=\r\nandashram days. When we reached near\nEsanya math about 8.30 a.m., Bhagavan =\r\nsat on a rock and said with tears in\nhis eyes he would never again come to =\r\nthe Ashram and would go where he\npleased and live in the forests or caves a=\r\nway from all men. I would not\nleave him and he would not come. It became ve=\r\nry late. We went there about 8\nor 8.30 a.m. and even when it became 1 p.m.w=\r\ne were still in this deadlock.\nBhagavan asked me to go into the town and ea=\r\nt my food and then come back if\nI wanted. But I was afraid that if I went B=\r\nhagavan would go away somewhere.=E2=80=9D\n\nSri Ramana also reports about tw=\r\no other escape attempts, =E2=80=9CAnother time too I\nwanted to run away fro=\r\nm all this crowd and live somewhere unknown, freely as\nI liked. That was wh=\r\nen I was in Virupaksha Cave. =E2=80=A6 But on that occasion my\nplans were f=\r\nrustrated by Yogananda Swami. I tried to be free on a third\noccasion also. =\r\nThat was after mother=E2=80=99s passing away. I did not want to have\neven a=\r\nn Ashram like Skandashram and the people that were coming there then.\nBut t=\r\nhe result has been this Ashram [Ramanashram] and all the crowd here.\nThus a=\r\nll my three attempts failed.=E2=80=9D\n\nAnother fixed part of the daily sche=\r\ndule was the chanting of the Veda\nparayana. At first, Brahmin boys used to =\r\ncome from town to do the chanting.\nLater, with the assistance of Major Chad=\r\nwick, the Ashram opened its own Veda\nschool (patasala), which is still in e=\r\nxistence today.\n\nThe chanting of the Vedas in the morning and evening laste=\r\nd around 40\nminutes. Texts from the Vedas were recited, as well as other Sa=\r\nnskrit texts,\nsuch as for example the Forty Verses in Praise of Ramana by G=\r\nanapati Muni\nand Sri Ramana=E2=80=99s Arunachala\nPancharatna and Upadesa Sa=\r\nram. This was then followed by the so-called Tamil\nParayana with other work=\r\ns by Sri Ramana.\n\nThe Maharshi attached great importance to this chanting, =\r\nstressing its\ncalming effect upon the mind. If he was asked if people shoul=\r\nd not also\nunderstand the texts, he would say that it was not necessary,it =\r\nwas\nsufficient to use them as an aid to meditation. He himself would sit up=\r\nright\non his couch during the chanting, his eyes taking on a faraway look.\n=\r\n\nSri Ramana left the management of the Ashram to his brother.As sarvadhikar=\r\ni,\nChinnaswami endeavoured to retain full control over everything that happ=\r\nened\nthere. This frequently led to arguments with devotees who disagreed wi=\r\nth his\ndecisions. But whatever was eventually decided had to be accepted by=\r\n all. If\nsomeone comRamana plained to Sri Ramana about Chinnaswami, the Mah=\r\narshi\nprotected his brother and never reversed his decisions.\n\nThere was no=\r\n point in complaining to Sri Ramana, as he never interfered in\nsuch dispute=\r\ns. When Ganapati Sastri (not to be confused with Ganapati Muni)\nwas banishe=\r\nd from the Ashram, he complained to Sri Ramana, =E2=80=9CChinnaswami has\nto=\r\nld me not to come to the Ashram. Bhagavan is just sitting like a stone\nVina=\r\nyaka statue. I have served the Ashram for a long time. I have also\ndonated =\r\nthree almiras [cupboards] full of books to the Ashram. Will Bhagavan\nnot as=\r\nk Chinnaswami why he is not allowing me to come to the Ashram?=E2=80=9D But=\r\n he\nreceived no answer to his complaint.\n\nWhenever someone wanted to interf=\r\nere in Ashram affairs Ramana would warn,\n=E2=80=9CPeople walk up the drive =\r\nto the Ashram in search of deliverance and then\nget caught up in Ashram pol=\r\nitics and forget what they came for. If such\nmatters were their concern the=\r\ny need not have come to Tiruvannamalai for\nthem.=E2=80=9D And to enthusiast=\r\nic reformers he advised that it would be sufficient\nfor them to reform them=\r\nselves.\n\nThere were, however, cases when Maharshi raised objections.When, f=\r\nor\nexample, the Ashram management decided to close the doors of the Hall fo=\r\nr\ntwo hours after lunch because of his weakened health, he protested by\nlea=\r\nving the Hall and sitting outside to welcome the visitors, commenting,\n=E2=\r\n=80=9CThe management is welcome to close the doors but I am free to meet th=\r\ne\nvisitors here.=E2=80=9D In cases such as this, where the decision of the =\r\nmanagement\nmeant that his devotees were prevented from coming to him for a =\r\ntime or if\nit would lead to some injustice, he could be uncompromising, say=\r\ning,\n=E2=80=9CYou can look after your Ashram.
