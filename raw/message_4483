Every time I com=\r\ne across the karma theory the following puzzle troubles me.\n\nLet&#39;s take two=\r\n milestomes of world population. In the year 1927 it was 2 billion and in t=\r\nhe year 1999 it was 6 billion. That means it has multiplied three fold over=\r\n a period of seventy two years which is the average human longevity. Let&#39;s =\r\nleave aside the fine maths about these figures. This means that every human=\r\n being who existed in 1927 must have died before 1999 and reborn( you may l=\r\neave provison of a few millions for those centenarians). There were 2 billi=\r\non jeevatmas &quot;trapped in human bodies&quot;in 1927 and 6 billion in 1999, an add=\r\nitional 4 billion. Where did they come from? I am able to see only two poss=\r\nibilities.\n\n1. Each jeevatma divided itself into 3 ( or more or less). In w=\r\nhich case did the sanchita karma of the original jeevatma of 1927 also get =\r\ndivided between the three ? That should make the karma less intense nowadya=\r\ns. Or did the 3 jeevatmas inherit the entire karma of their predecessor eac=\r\nh one in full (poornamada poornamidam ........)?\n\n2.Some jeevatmas &quot;trapped=\r\n&quot; in plants and animals graduated into humans. Karma arises only out of act=\r\nion performed with free will or action performed with attachment. Plants an=\r\nd animals do not carry any sanchita karma. When they are at the entry level=\r\n of a series of human lives they should be coming in with a zero balance of=\r\n sanchita karma. In which case, at least 4 billion (or even a billion if my=\r\n maths is wrong !) of the world population should not have any sanchita kar=\r\nma.\n\nOr, it could be a mix of the above two.\n\nOr, is it possible that the t=\r\notal number of humans who have died until now could exceed 6 billion ? This=\r\n may not be possible because from generation to generation we see a multipl=\r\nication of numbers. 1+2+4 can not be more than 8. That&#39;s why the population=\r\n is on the increase.\n\nPlease help.\n\n\n"}}
