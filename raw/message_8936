Posted by: &quot;rajarshi nandy&quot; rajarshi14 Dear Ajit,\n\nThanks for t=\r\nhe explanations. Very interesting.\n\nThis reminds me of an incident with a g=\r\nood friend of mine. There is an individual I know, who had never chanted th=\r\ne Savitur-Gayatri mantra ever. He used to feel, as per his own confession, =\r\nno special love or attraction for this mantra and being born in a non-brahm=\r\nin family, there was no religious-cultural occasion where he was formally i=\r\nntroduced to this mantra. \n\nOne day while meditating on some Tantrik mantra=\r\ns, he got a random inspiration to meditate on the Gayatri mantra. He had a =\r\nvague idea of what the Gayatri mantra meant, and no idea at all of correct =\r\nswara or intonation. So he started chanting, mentally and soundlessly, the =\r\nSavitur Gayatri mantra. Within less than 20-30 japas of the mantra, he felt=\r\n/saw - and I describe it as he told me - an unbroken steam of tremendous, p=\r\nure, flood of Golden Light above his head. Like a world above and outside o=\r\nur world. Intensely pure, intensely Divine. The eventual idea, he told me, =\r\nwas to enter into that stream of Light above and see things from that persp=\r\nective. But as long as there are impurities in the mind and body, it is not=\r\n possible to enter into that realm easily. The gunas must be in a stable eq=\r\nuilibrium. Neither the laziness of Tamas, nor the impatience of rajas is co=\r\nnducive for it, but the stable, illuminating, self-assurance of satwa leadi=\r\nng to a deeper\nequanimity in mind and life is needed.\n\nApparently, he also =\r\nrealized that there are some Tantrik mantras of Ma which serve a similar pu=\r\nrpose as the Gayatri mantra. They take a person to the spiritual planes abo=\r\nve.\n\nSo I asked him why did you not continue the meditation or japa of Gaya=\r\ntri mantra, since there was a nice experience. He said it would have pulled=\r\n him in and he would not have been able to continue the spiritual practices=\r\n which he was already doing for some time, and leaving something half way i=\r\ns not good.\n\nReading the explanation your provided below, that is : \n\n&quot;We m=\r\neditate upon that Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) our (naH) \nthough=\r\nts (dhiyaH). He blesses us with subtle eyesight. Without his \nlight, we wou=\r\nld not be able to distinguish different objects. This is \nexplained in the =\r\nAitaterya Upanishad =E2=80=9CThe sun, having become eyesight, \nentered the =\r\neyes=E2=80=9D. He thus blesses all living beings.&quot;\n\n.. matches with the des=\r\ncription that I had heard from my friend.

This follows the fam=\r\nous verse from the Agastya Smriti -- =E2=80=9Cyo devaH savitA  .asmAkam dhi=\r\nyo dharmAdigocarAH. prerayet tasya yad bhargaH tad vareNyam upAsmahe=E2=80=\r\n=9D. \n \nWe meditate upon (dhiimahi) the splendor / tejas (bhargaH) of the d=\r\neva (devasya) that is the Sun (savituH). This tejas is the light of the sun=\r\n, which is experienced by all living beings, and is thus easy to meditate u=\r\npon.\n \nWhatever is experienced is easy to meditate upon, and that which is =\r\nnot experienced can be difficult to meditate upon. Everyone can meditate up=\r\non the light of the Sun. This is why this meaning for the Gayatri mantra is=\r\n always taken first. \n \nvareNyam =3D whatever we can ask / desire. Through =\r\nall karmas and upaasanaas, whatever fruits we may ask for is vareNyam. =E2=\r\n=80=9CSavitaa&quot; is the fruit of all karmas ... this is taught in the Chandog=\r\nya Upanishad. [ A long explanation follows, which is omitted here ].  We me=\r\nditate upon the splendor of the sun, which is vareNyam.\n \nWe meditate upon =\r\nthat Savitaa (yaH) who impels (prachodayaat) our (naH) thoughts (dhiyaH). H=\r\ne blesses us with subtle eyesight. Without his light, we would not be able =\r\nto distinguish different objects.

Posted by: &quot;Narasimha PVR Rao&quot; pvr108 \nNam=\r\naste,\n\nThere are two versions in the Ganapathi mantra compendium I refer to=\r\n:\n\n(1) OM shrIM gaM saumyAya gaNapataye varavarada sarvajanaM me \nvashamAna=\r\nya svAhA\n\nI think Ajit has already given the same.\n\n(2) OM namo lakShmIgaNe=\r\nshAya mahyaM putraM prayachCha svAhA\n\nThis version is used specifically for=\r\n begetting children. Recommended \nprocedure is to keep some butter in front=\r\n, chant this mantra and then \nfor the lady wanting a child to eat it (after=\r\n bath at the end of her \nmenstrual period).\n\n(3) In addition, there is a ma=\r\nntra for Lakshmi sitting on the lap of \nGanapathi (gaNeshAMka nivAsinI mahA=\r\nlakShmI mantra). This mantra can also \nbe offered to Lakshmi as a part of a=\r\n Ganapathi homam:\n\nOM shrIM hrIM klIM glauM gaM OM namo bhagavati mahAlakSh=\r\nmi varade shrIM \nvibhUtyai svAhA\n\nThis is specifically used for prosperity.=\r\n Mahalakshmi on the lap of \nGanesha symbolizes tremendous prosperity that c=\r\nomes with stability that \nis accompanied by childlike innocence and unwaver=\r\ning focus.\n\n(4) There is another Ganapathi mantra with Lakshmi beeja occurr=\r\ning \nseveral times. It is known as Sampadganapathi mantra. It is also \nreco=\r\nmmended for prosperity:\n\nOM shrIM glauM hrIM OM shrIM hrIM klIM glauM gaM s=\r\nhrIM glauM hrIM \ngaNapate vara-varada shrIM glauM hrIM sarva-janaM me vasha=\r\nmAnaya \nsampadaM dehi svAhA\n\n* * *\n\nA few other Ganapathi mantras that can =\r\nbe useful to some people here.

Posted by: &quot;priyank_priy=\r\nank&quot; priyank_priyank Namaste all, \n\nThankyou PVR ji for sharing all the spe=\r\ncific mantras.\n\nmy 2 cents and please feel free to correct me if i am wrong=\r\n.\n\nOne God manifests as different deities with different attributes and cha=\r\nracters. In the very same way each specialized form of diety himself has hi=\r\ns own characteristics and temperament (from benovelent to playful to xxxxx =\r\n). This holds true for ganapati also.\n\nIt might be far far more better to s=\r\ntick to Mahaganapati and do a homam to him with his simple mantra for HIS p=\r\nleasure (not urs), and AFTER homam (before saying goodby) ask for his grace=\r\n, love, his help to solve whatever ur problems.\n\nIts my experience that com=\r\nplicated mantra with specific purpose tend to be &quot;driven by&quot; and &quot;invoke&quot; a=\r\n specific want in our greedy nature, rather than having love, surrender and=\r\n joy for diety. \n\nregards...\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimh=\r\na PVR Rao wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; There are two versions in the Ganapat=\r\nhi mantra compendium I refer to:\n&gt; \n&gt; (1) OM shrIM gaM saumyAya gaNapataye =\r\nvaravarada sarvajanaM me \n&gt; vashamAnaya svAhA\n&gt; \n&gt; I think Ajit has already=\r\n given the same.\n&gt; \n&gt; (2) OM namo lakShmIgaNeshAya mahyaM putraM prayachCha=\r\n svAhA\n&gt; \n&gt; This version is used specifically for begetting children.

This mantra can also \n&gt; be offered to Lakshmi as a part of a Ganapathi h=\r\nomam:\n&gt; \n&gt; OM shrIM hrIM klIM glauM gaM OM namo bhagavati mahAlakShmi varad=\r\ne shrIM \n&gt; vibhUtyai svAhA\n&gt; \n&gt; This is specifically used for prosperity.

One who learns to love them and give=\r\n them \nwhatever one is in a position to give, without doing any calculation=\r\ns, \nwill actually end up enjoying a great and emotionally fulfilling \nrelat=\r\nionship.\n\nSimilarly, one who wants &quot;maximum benefit&quot; from a mantra or deity=\r\nu and \nthinks in those terms will not really enjoy a good relationship with=\r\n a \nmantra or deity. One who learns to love a mantra and give it whatever \n=\r\ntime and energy one is in a position to give, without doing any \ncalculatio=\r\nns, will actually end up enjoying a great and spiritually \nfulfilling relat=\r\nionship.\n\n* * *\n\nOne possibility is to focus on the sound of the mantra and=\r\n its ups and \ndowns and not visualize any form.\n\nAnother possibility is to =\r\nimagine 5-headed Ma Gayatri. She controls the \ndoor at the bottom of Sushum=\r\nna nadi (the channel of pure awareness) for \nKundalini (self-awareness) to =\r\nrise up. The five heads are perhaps \nsymbols of the five sheaths in our exi=\r\nstence (sheaths of matter, life \nforce, mind, awareness and bliss).\n\nAnothe=\r\nr possibility is to imagine Savita, the bright spiritual Sun \n(&quot;Self&quot;) who =\r\nshines light on every object of this cosmos.\n\nAnother possibility is to ima=\r\ngine Savitri, the consort of Savita, who \nshines as a bright light that fil=\r\nls entire Sushumna nadi, in which all \nseven worlds exist.\n\nAnother possibi=\r\nlity is to imagine Savita and Savitr together.\n\nAbother possibility is to i=\r\nmagine Supreme Cosmic Being who with his \nShakti creates, sustains and dest=\r\nroys all worlds and beings in them. You \ncan imagine Him as a super-person =\r\nwith thousands of hands, legs, heads \netc, who is seeing, hearing, smelling=\r\n, tasting through all beings of \ncosmos. Or you can imagine him as a bright=\r\n light from which every world \nand being comes. Or you can imagine him as t=\r\nhe sound of Om that \nreverberates in the entire cosmos and causes all movem=\r\nent in the \nconsciousness of all beings. All these visualizations are very =\r\nsmall \naspects of his actual personality!!!!!!!!!!\n\nNow, if you want, you c=\r\nan give a name to this supreme cosmic being and \ncall him as Krishna or Nar=\r\nayana or Sadashiva or Ahora Mazda or Holy \nGhost or whatever.\n\nIf it is eas=\r\nier, you can imagine the Shakti of Supreme Cosmic Being and \nimagine how Sh=\r\ne pervades the entire cosmos and creates, sustains and \ndestroys everything=\r\n.\n\nNow, if you want, you can give a name to this Shakti and call Her Aadyaa=\r\n \nShakti or Paraa Shakti or Mahalaskshmi or Durga or Lalita or Chandi or \nj=\r\nust Ma or whatever.\n\n* * *\n\nNow, out of all these possibilities, what is th=\r\ne best? That depends on \nYOU, Sir. Whatever visualization makes it easier f=\r\nor you to love and get \nlost in, it, is better for you. Only you can know t=\r\nhat.\n\nIn the beginning, one may force oneself and do sadhana mechanically. =\r\n\nThere may be a lot of force and friction in sadhana. But, eventually, it \n=\r\nshould become smooth. Friction should reduce and enjoyment should \nincrease=\r\n. It may take a long time.

Hence they are never meant to be taken \nlitera=\r\nlly ever. They are meant to encourage the devotee to pursue a \nparticular p=\r\nath.\n\n1. The Rama Rameti shloka tells one Rama name equals 100 names of \nVi=\r\nshnu. (This shloka is from Padma Purana)\n\n2. Next we have Brahmanda Purana =\r\nthat says:\nsahasra-namnam punyanam, trir-avrttya tu yat phalam;\nekavrttya t=\r\nu krsnasya, namaikam tat prayacchati\n\none Krishna Japa =3D 3 Rama Japa\n\n3. =\r\nWhat more, the same anushashasana parva in which Vishnu Sahasra Nama \nis pr=\r\nesent in Mahabharata has Krishna saying this :\n\nyO mAm nama sahasrena stotu=\r\nmicchati pandava\nyohamekena shlokena stuta eva na samshaya\n\nBy saying this =\r\nKrishna is implying that one can get the same punya os \nsaying entire Vishn=\r\nu sahasra nama just by saying one shloka of Vishnu \nSahasra nama..

(Much like GNU sta=\r\nnds for GNU is not UNIX !!)\n\nHence this one name being equivalent to N othe=\r\nr names is a wild goose \nchase. As PVRji said, its all in the state of mind=\r\n.\n\nBut there is a specific meditation technique that can be specifically \na=\r\npplied to Vishnu Sahasra nama and it is mentioned in preface of VSN \nitself=\r\n (yaani naamaani gauNani vikhyaataani mahatmanah). Here gauNa does \nnot mea=\r\nn minor. It means &quot;being related to guna&quot;. It means each name \nextolls one =\r\n(several actually) attributes of Vishnu.

Whether one is chanting \n&gt; oneself or liste=\r\nning to a person/cassette/ CD/MP3, is not the primary \n&gt; factor. The primar=\r\ny factor is how focused one&#39;s mind is on it. The \n&gt; goal of chanting a stot=\r\nra or a mantra is to eliminate or atleast limit \n&gt; other thoughts and focus=\r\n the mind on it. That can happen with chanting \n&gt; as well as listening.\n&gt; F=\r\nor example, I may be chanting Vishnu sahasra nama stotra and yet my \n&gt; mind=\r\n may be wandering everywhere and focusing on all kind of dirty \n&gt; thoughts.=\r\n Another person listening to me while doing some chores may \n&gt; be focusing =\r\na good part of their mental attention on the prayer and \n&gt; contemplating ea=\r\nch word and its meaning and contemplating the \n&gt; qualities of Lord. In that=\r\n case, that listener will get a lot more \n&gt; benefit from it than I will!\n&gt; =\r\nEach deity has some qualities. Focusing the mind on a deity and \n&gt; his/her =\r\nmantra increases those qualities, over time, in one&#39;s own mind \n&gt; and in on=\r\ne&#39;s surroundings. If a lot of sadhakas with good \n&gt; concentration worship C=\r\nhandi in this world, there may be a lot of \n&gt; violent outrage and fierce fi=\r\nght against adharma in this world. If a \n&gt; lot of sadhakas with good concen=\r\ntration worship Vishnu, there may be \n&gt; an upsurge of calm, self-assured an=\r\nd confident sattwa in the fight for \n&gt; establishing dharma. These energies =\r\nbalance each other. World is \n&gt; probably in a transition phase right now an=\r\nd worshippers of Chandi are \n&gt; needed. But, soon, we will need a lot more p=\r\neople worshipping Vishnu.\n&gt; By the way, good sadhakas worshipping Ganesha i=\r\nncrease the sense of \n&gt; stability and groundedness in the world.\n&gt; Second: =\r\nAnushtup is the metre with 8 syllables per line and 4 lines \n&gt; per verse.

One =\r\nwho wants to get &quot;maximum benefit&quot; from relationship with mother or wife or=\r\n daughter and thinking in those terms is unlikely to really enjoy a good re=\r\nlationship with them. One who learns to love them and give them whatever on=\r\ne is in a position to give, without doing any calculations, will actually e=\r\nnd up enjoying a great and emotionally fulfilling relationship. Similarly, =\r\none who wants &quot;maximum benefit&quot; from a mantra or deityu and thinks in those=\r\n terms will not really enjoy a good relationship with a mantra or deity. On=\r\ne who learns to love a mantra and give it whatever time and energy one is i=\r\nn a position to give, without doing any calculations, will actually end up =\r\nenjoying a great and spiritually fulfilling relationship. *        *       =\r\n * One possibility is to focus on the sound of the mantra and its ups\nand d=\r\nowns and not visualize any form. Another possibility is to imagine 5-headed=\r\n Ma Gayatri. She controls the door at the bottom of Sushumna nadi (the chan=\r\nnel of pure awareness) for Kundalini (self-awareness) to rise up. The five =\r\nheads are perhaps symbols of the five sheaths in our existence (sheaths of =\r\nmatter, life force, mind, awareness and bliss). Another possibility is to i=\r\nmagine Savita, the bright spiritual Sun (&quot;Self&quot;) who shines light on every =\r\nobject of this cosmos. Another possibility is to imagine Savitri, the conso=\r\nrt of Savita, who shines as a bright light that fills entire Sushumna nadi,=\r\n in which all seven worlds exist. Another possibility is to imagine Savita =\r\nand Savitr together. Abother possibility is to imagine Supreme Cosmic Being=\r\n who with his Shakti creates, sustains and destroys all worlds and beings i=\r\nn them. You can imagine Him as a super-person with thousands of hands, legs=\r\n, heads etc, who is seeing, hearing, smelling, tasting\nthrough all beings o=\r\nf cosmos. Or you can imagine him as a bright light from which every world a=\r\nnd being comes. Or you can imagine him as the sound of Om that reverberates=\r\n in the entire cosmos and causes all movement in the consciousness of all b=\r\neings. All these visualizations are very small aspects of his actual person=\r\nality!!!!!!!!!! Now, if you want, you can give a name to this supreme cosmi=\r\nc being and call him as Krishna or Narayana or Sadashiva or Ahora Mazda or =\r\nHoly Ghost or whatever. If it is easier, you can imagine the Shakti of Supr=\r\neme Cosmic Being and imagine how She pervades the entire cosmos and creates=\r\n, sustains and destroys everything. Now, if you want, you can give a name t=\r\no this Shakti and call Her Aadyaa Shakti or Paraa Shakti or Mahalaskshmi or=\r\n Durga or Lalita or Chandi or just Ma or whatever. *        *        * Now,=\r\n out of all these possibilities, what is the best? That depends on YOU, Sir=\r\n. Whatever visualization\nmakes it easier for you to love and get lost in, i=\r\nt, is better for you. Only you can know that. In the beginning, one may for=\r\nce oneself and do sadhana mechanically. There may be a lot of force and fri=\r\nction in sadhana. But, eventually, it should become smooth. Friction should=\r\n reduce and enjoyment should increase. It may take a long time. But, until =\r\nthat happens, one is just rehearsing.

Hence they are never =\r\nmeant to be taken literally ever. They are meant to encourage the devotee t=\r\no pursue a particular path. \n1. The Rama Rameti shloka tells one Rama name =\r\nequals 100 names of Vishnu. (This shloka is from Padma Purana) \n2. Next we =\r\nhave Brahmanda Purana that says: sahasra-namnam punyanam, trir-avrttya tu y=\r\nat phalam; ekavrttya tu krsnasya, namaikam tat prayacchati \none Krishna Jap=\r\na =3D 3 Rama Japa \n3. What more, the same anushashasana parva in which Vish=\r\nnu Sahasra Nama is present in Mahabharata has Krishna saying this : \nyO mAm=\r\n nama sahasrena stotumicchati pandava yohamekena shlokena stuta eva na sams=\r\nhaya \nBy saying this Krishna is implying that one can get the same punya os=\r\n saying entire Vishnu sahasra nama just by saying one shloka of Vishnu Saha=\r\nsra nama.. Now each shloka of VSN is equivalent to entire VSN itself.. Now =\r\nwe have circular reference in the equation that can never be satisfied !! (=\r\nMuch like GNU stands for GNU is not UNIX !!) \nHence this one name being equ=\r\nivalent to N other names is a wild goose chase. As PVRji said, its all in t=\r\nhe state of mind. \nBut there is a specific meditation technique that can be=\r\n specifically applied to Vishnu Sahasra nama and it is mentioned in preface=\r\n of VSN itself (yaani naamaani gauNani vikhyaataani mahatmanah). Here gauNa=\r\n does not mean minor. It means &quot;being related to guna&quot;. It means each name =\r\nextolls one (several actually) attributes of Vishnu. One can ponder over th=\r\nat quality of Vishnu as that name comes up. It takes up time to practice su=\r\nch technique and requires quite a bit of cross reference reading. It is to =\r\nbe slowly developed over time. But it is very effective. \nRegards, Srikanth=\r\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao wrote: &gt; &gt; &gt; Nam=\r\naste, &gt; &gt; First, on Ranga&#39;s question: &gt; &gt; There is no single &quot;effective&quo=\r\n t; way. Whether one is chanting oneself or &gt; listening to a person/cassett=\r\ne/ CD/MP3, is not the primary factor. The &gt; primary factor is how focused o=\r\nne&#39;s mind is on it. The goal of chanting &gt; a stotra or a mantra is to elimi=\r\nnate or atleast limit other thoughts and &gt; focus the mind on it. That can h=\r\nappen with chanting as well as &gt; listening. &gt; &gt; For example, I may be chant=\r\ning Vishnu sahasra nama stotra and yet my &gt; mind may be wandering everywher=\r\ne and focusing on all kind of dirty &gt; thoughts. Another person listening to=\r\n me while doing some chores may be &gt; focusing a good part of their mental a=\r\nttention on the prayer and &gt; contemplating each word and its meaning and co=\r\nntemplating the qualities &gt; of Lord. In that case, that listener will get a=\r\n lot more benefit from it &gt; than I will! &gt; &gt; Each deity has some\nqualities.=\r\n Focusing the mind on a deity and his/her &gt; mantra increases those qualitie=\r\ns, over time, in one&#39;s own mind and in &gt; one&#39;s surroundings. If a lot of sa=\r\ndhakas with good concentration worship &gt; Chandi in this world, there may be=\r\n a lot of violent outrage and fierce &gt; fight against adharma in this world.=\r\n If a lot of sadhakas with good &gt; concentration worship Vishnu, there may b=\r\ne an upsurge of calm, &gt; self-assured and confident sattwa in the fight for =\r\nestablishing dharma. &gt; These energies balance each other. World is probably=\r\n in a transition &gt; phase right now and worshippers of Chandi are needed. Bu=\r\nt, soon, we will &gt; need a lot more people worshipping Vishnu. &gt; &gt; By the wa=\r\ny, good sadhakas worshipping Ganesha increase the sense of &gt; stability and =\r\ngroundedness in the world. &gt; &gt; Second: Anushtup is the metre with 8 syllabl=\r\nes per line and 4 lines per &gt; verse. Whole Vishnu sahasra naama stotra is i=\r\nn anushtup metre. &gt; Traditionally, one specific verse is\nsaid to be equival=\r\nent to reading &gt; all 1000 names: &gt; &gt; shrIrAma rAma rAmeti. rame rAme manora=\r\nme. &gt; sahasra nAma tattulyaM. rAma nAma vrAnane.. &gt; &gt; Actually, this verse =\r\nmeans that chanting &quot;shrIrAma rAma rAma&quot; mantra &gt; (known as Amrita mantra) =\r\nis equivalent to chanting 1000 names. &gt; &gt; However, don&#39;t take it as a short=\r\ncut. If one is lazy and unfocused, &gt; chanting this verse even 100 times may=\r\n do nothing. First, engage in some &gt; regular practices to remove laziness, =\r\ninstill discipline and sincerity, &gt; and get a state of mind where you can f=\r\nocus well on god.

Very interesting.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;This reminds me of=\r\n an incident with a good friend of mine. There is an individual I know, who=\r\n had never chanted the Savitur-Gayatri mantra ever. He used to feel, as per=\r\n his own confession, no special love or attraction for this mantra and bein=\r\ng born in a non-brahmin family, there was no religious-cultural occasion wh=\r\nere he was formally introduced to this mantra. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One day while medita=\r\nting on some Tantrik mantras, he got a random inspiration to meditate on th=\r\ne Gayatri mantra. He had a vague idea of what the Gayatri mantra meant, and=\r\n no idea at all of correct swara or intonation. So he started chanting, men=\r\ntally and soundlessly, the Savitur Gayatri mantra. Within less than 20-30 j=\r\napas of the mantra, he felt/saw - and I describe it as he told me - an unbr=\r\noken steam of tremendous, pure, flood of Golden Light above his head. Like =\r\na world above and outside our world. Intensely pure, intensely Divine. The =\r\neventual idea, he told me, was to enter into that stream of Light above and=\r\n see things from that perspective. But as long as there are impurities in t=\r\nhe mind and body, it is not possible to enter into that realm easily. The g=\r\nunas must be in a stable equilibrium. Neither the laziness of Tamas, nor th=\r\ne impatience of rajas is conducive for it, but the stable, illuminating, se=\r\nlf-assurance of satwa leading to a deeper&lt;BR&gt;equanimity in mind and life is=\r\n needed.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Apparently, he also realized that there are some Tantrik ma=\r\nntras of Ma which serve a similar purpose as the Gayatri mantra. They take =\r\na person to the spiritual planes above.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;So I asked him why did you n=\r\not continue the meditation or japa of Gayatri mantra, since there was a nic=\r\ne experience. He said it would have pulled him in and he would not have bee=\r\nn able to continue the spiritual practices which he was already doing for s=\r\nome time, and leaving something half way is not good.&lt;B\n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
