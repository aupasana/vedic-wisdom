It is the same with other bei=\r\nngs also.\nThis holds good for the common run of mankind. But the higher ord=\r\ner is bent\nupon right conduct, enduring patiently the good or evil that it =\r\nmay bring.\nFellowship with these will be lasting, whereas fellowship with o=\r\nrdinary\npeople will not be. Good will result to the world through fellowshi=\r\np with\nthe higher order only.\n\nThe question then arises: &quot;What is right?&#39;&#39; =\r\nThe point is important, but the\nanswer has not been found. Why? Because wha=\r\nt is right is determined by\ncircumstances. However comprehensive a work may=\r\n be written on the subject,\nthere will always be circumstances not envisage=\r\nd by the author. Therefore it\nbecomes necessary to realize that state which=\r\n will enable us to assess the\nvarious conditions and determine what is righ=\r\nt.\n\nThat state is one only. There are no states like it. Although it is sin=\r\ngle,\nit is extraordinary that the worldly wise consider it exceedingly rare=\r\n.\nNothing can be more extraordinary than this. That unique state is very\ncl=\r\nearly taught in the Upanishads. In this book I have put down the same\ntruth=\r\n according to my understanding. I have considered it my duty. I do not\nclai=\r\nm originality. The six chapters of this book are so closely interrelated\nth=\r\nat some point which may be expected in one chapter may be found in\nanother.=\r\n Again a few points which may not be clear on a superficial reading\nwill be=\r\ncome clear upon closer study. More may be gathered from major works\nor Sage=\r\ns. Universal Mother, Master true, save us!\n\n- The Author\n\nThe Text\n\nChapter=\r\n I - UNITY\n\n1. All including the world seen by you and yourself, the seer o=\r\nf the world,\nis one only.\n\n2. All that you consider as I, you, he, she and =\r\nit, is one only.\n\n3. What you consider to be sentient beings and what you c=\r\nonsider to be\ninsentient, such as earth, air, fire and water is all one.\n\n4=\r\n. The good which is derived by your considering all as one cannot be had by=\r\n\nconsidering each as separate from the other. Therefore all is one.\n\n5. The=\r\n knowledge of the unity of all, is good for you and good for others as\nwell=\r\n. Therefore all is one.\n\n6. He who sees &quot;I am separate,&quot; &quot;you are separate,=\r\n&quot; &quot;he is separate&quot; and so\non, acts one way to himself and another way to ot=\r\nhers. He cannot help doing\nso. The thought &quot;I am separate, others are separ=\r\nate&quot; is the seed from which\ngrows the tree of differing actions in relation=\r\n to different persons. How\ncan there be any lapse from righteousness for a =\r\nperson who knows the unity\nof himself with others? As long as the germ of d=\r\nifferentiation is there, the\ntree of differing actions will flourish, even =\r\nunawares. Therefore give up\ndifferentiation. All is one only.\n\n7. Ask: &quot;If =\r\nin the world all things appear different, how can I consider all\nas one? Is=\r\n there any way of gaining this knowledge?&quot; The reply is: &quot;In the\nsame tree =\r\nwe see leaves, flowers, berries and branches, different from one\nanother, y=\r\net they are all one because they are all included in the word\n&#39;tree&#39;. Their=\r\n root is the same; their sap is the same. Similarly, all\nthings, all bodies=\r\n, all organisms are from the same source and activated by\na single life pri=\r\nnciple.&quot; Therefore all is one.\n\n8. 0h good man! Is the statement that &quot;All =\r\nis one,&quot; good or evil? Think for\nyourself. Just as the person will always b=\r\ne righteous who regards himself\nlike others and others like himself, how ca=\r\nn any evil attach itself to him\nwho knows himself to be others and the othe=\r\nrs to be himself? Tell me if\nthere is any better way for obtaining good tha=\r\nn the knowledge of unity?\nCertainly other methods cannot be as good as this=\r\n one. How can anyone love\nothers more than when knowing them to be himself,=\r\n to know them in unity-love\nas unity, for they are truly one.\n\n9. Who can s=\r\nhare the mental peace and freshness of the knower of unity? He\nhas no cares=\r\n. The Good of all is his own good. A mother considers her\nchildren&#39;s well-b=\r\neing to be her own well-being. Still, her love is not\nperfect because she t=\r\nhinks she is separate and her children are separate.\nThe love of a Sage, wh=\r\no has realized the unity of all, far excels even the\nlove of a mother. Ther=\r\ne is no other means of gaining such love than the\nknowledge of unity. There=\r\nfore all is one.\n\n10. Know that the world as a whole is your undecaying bod=\r\ny and that you are\nthe everlasting life of the whole world. Tell me if ther=\r\ne is any harm in\ndoing so? Who fears to go the harmless way? Be courageous.=\r\n The Vedas teach\nthis very truth. There is nothing but yourself. All good w=\r\nill be yours. Yea,\nyou become the good itself. All that others gain from yo=\r\nu will be good only.\nWho will work evil to his own body and soul? A remedy =\r\nis applied if there is\nan abscess in the body. Even if the remedy is painfu=\r\nl, it is meant to do\ngood only. Such will be some of your actions; they wil=\r\nl also be for the good\nof the world. For that reason, you will not be invol=\r\nved in differentiation.\nI put it briefly: The knower of unity will act as o=\r\nne should. In fact, the\nknowledge of unity makes him act. He cannot err. In=\r\n the world, he is God\nmade visible. All is one.\n\n\nHere is Chapter II from E=\r\nllam Ondre:\n\nYou\n\n1. Who are you? Are you this body? If so, why are you not=\r\n aware of a serpent\ncrawling on it when you are in deep sleep? So then can =\r\nyou be this body? No,\ncertainly not. You must be other than this body.\n\n2. =\r\nSometimes in sleep you dream. There you identify yourself with someone.\nCan=\r\n you be that one? You cannot be. Otherwise, what becomes of that\nindividual=\r\n on your waking? You are not he. Furthermore, you are ashamed of\nhaving ide=\r\nntified yourself with him. Clearly, you are not that particular\nperson. You=\r\n are the one that stands apart from him.\n\n3. Recall the state of dreamless =\r\nslumber. What is your state then? Can that\nbe your true nature? Surely you =\r\nwill not subscribe to this belief. Why?\nBecause you are not so foolish as t=\r\no identify yourself with the massive\ndarkness which obstructs you from know=\r\ning the state you are in. Discerned by\nthe intellect from the things around=\r\n, how can you admit yourself to be the\nsame as ignorance or blank? Or, how =\r\ncan it truly be your real nature? It\ncannot be. You are the knower who know=\r\ns that this state remains one of dense\ndarkness veiling your true nature. H=\r\now can you be that which you have\nexperienced and condemned? Therefore you =\r\nare not the dark ignorance of deep\nsleep. You stand apart from this too.\n\n4=\r\n. When it is said that even this gross body is not you, can you be any\nothe=\r\nr thing which is yet farther away from you? In the same way that you are\nno=\r\nt this gross body, you are not anything farther from the body, nor the\ndrea=\r\nm person, nor the ignorance of deep sleep. You are distinct from these\nthre=\r\ne states and this world.\n\n5. These three states can be reduced to two condi=\r\ntions only-namely, the one\nof the subject and object, and the other is the =\r\nunawareness of the subject\nitself. The former includes the waking and dream=\r\n states, whereas the latter\nrepresents deep slumber. All your experiences a=\r\nre comprised in these two\nconditions only. Both of them are foreign to you.=\r\n Your true nature remains\ndistinct from them.\n\n6. If you ask what that is, =\r\nit is called turiya, which means the fourth\nstate. Why is this name used? T=\r\nhis name is proper because it seems to say\nthe three states of your experie=\r\nnce-waking, dream and deep sleep-are foreign\nto you and your true state is =\r\nthe fourth, which is different from these\nthree. Should the three states, w=\r\naking, dream and deep sleep, be taken to\nform one long dream, the fourth st=\r\nate represents the waking from this dream.\nThus it is more withdrawn than d=\r\neep sleep, also more wakeful than the waking\nstate. Therefore your true sta=\r\nte is that fourth one which is distinguished\nfrom the waking, dream and dee=\r\np sleep states. You are that only. What is\nthis fourth state? It is knowled=\r\nge which does not particularize anything. It\nis not unaware of itself. That=\r\n is to say, the fourth state is Pure Knowledge\nwhich is not conscious of an=\r\ny object, but not unconscious itself. Only he\nwho has realized it even for =\r\na trice, has realized the Truth. You are that\nonly.\n\n8. What is there more =\r\nfor him who has gained the fourth state? Practically,\nit is not possible fo=\r\nr anyone to remain forever in that state, that is, the\nstate of no particul=\r\nar knowledge. He who has realized the fourth state later\nwakes up in this w=\r\norld, but for him this world is not as before. He sees\nthat what he realize=\r\nd as the fourth state, shines forth as all this. He will\nnot imagine this w=\r\norld as distinct from that Pure Knowledge. Thus what he\nsaw within, he now =\r\nsees without in a different form. In the place of the\ndifferentiation of ol=\r\nd, he is now established in the state of\nnon-differentiation everywhere. No=\r\nw, he is all. There is nothing distinct\nfrom himself. His eyes closed or op=\r\nen, howsoever the things may change, his\nstate remains unchanged. This is t=\r\nhe state of Brahman. This is the natural\neternal state. You are that ever-t=\r\nrue state.\n\n9. There is nothing beyond this state. The words, &#39;inward&#39; and =\r\n&#39;outward&#39;\nhave no meaning for him. All is one. His body, speech and mind ca=\r\nnnot\nfunction selfishly. Their workings will be grace for the good of all. =\r\nThe\nfragmentary &quot;I&quot; is lost forever. His ego can never revive. Therefore he=\r\n is\nsaid to be liberated here and now. He does not live because his body li=\r\nves,\nnor does he die because his body dies. He is eternal. There is nothing=\r\n other\nthan he. You are He.\n\n10. Who is God? He is grace. What is Grace? Aw=\r\nareness without the\nfragmentary ego. How can one know that there is such a =\r\nstate? Only if one\nrealizes it. The Vedas laud such a one as having realize=\r\nd God and become one\nwith Him. Therefore the greatest good that one can der=\r\nive from the world and\nthe greatest good which one can render unto it, is t=\r\no realize this state. In\nfact, there are no states besides this. They appea=\r\nr in the state of\nignorance. For him who knows, there is one state only. Yo=\r\nu are that.\n\n...

That unique state is very clearly taught in the =\r\nUpanishads. In this book I have put down the same truth according to my und=\r\nerstanding. I have considered it my duty. I do not claim originality. The s=\r\nix chapters of this book are so closely interrelated that some point which =\r\nmay be expected in one chapter may be found in another.

This name is proper because it seems to say the three states o=\r\nf your experience-waking, dream and deep sleep-are foreign to you and your =\r\ntrue state is the fourth, which is different from these three.=C2=A0&lt;span s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Should the three states, waking, dream and deep s=\r\nleep, be taken to form one long dream, the fourth state represents the waki=\r\nng from this dream. Thus it is more withdrawn than deep sleep, also more wa=\r\nkeful than the waking state. Therefore your true state is that fourth one w=\r\nhich is distinguished from the waking, dream and deep sleep states. You are=\r\n that only.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0What is this fourth state? It is knowledge which do=\r\nes not particularize anything. It is not unaware of itself. That is to say,=\r\n the fourth state is Pure Knowledge which is not conscious of any object, b=\r\nut not unconscious itself. Only he who has realized it even for a trice, ha=\r\ns realized the Truth. You are that only.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt:bold&quot;&gt;8. What is there more for him who has gained the fourth state? Prac=\r\ntically, it is not possible for anyone to remain forever in that state, tha=\r\nt is, the state of no particular knowledge. He who has realized the fourth =\r\nstate later wakes up in this world, but for him this world is not as before=\r\n. He sees that what he realized as the fourth state, shines forth as all th=\r\nis. He will not imagine this world as distinct from that Pure Knowledge. Th=\r\nus what he saw within, he now sees without in a different form. In the plac=\r\ne of the differentiation of old, he is now established in the state of non-=\r\ndifferentiation everywhere. Now, he is all. There is nothing distinct from =\r\nhimself. His eyes closed or open, howsoever the things may change, his stat=\r\ne remains unchanged. This is the state of Brahman. This is the natural eter=\r\nnal state. You are that ever-true state.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;9. There is nothin=\r\ng beyond this state. The words, &#39;inward&#39; and &#39;outward&#39; have=\r\n no meaning for him. All is one. His body, speech and mind cannot function =\r\nselfishly. Their workings will be grace for the good of all. The fragmentar=\r\ny &quot;I&quot; is lost forever. His ego can never revive. Therefore he is =\r\nsaid to be liberated here and now. He does not live because his body lives,=\r\n nor does he die because his body dies. He is eternal. There is nothing oth=\r\ner than he. You are He.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;10. Who is God? He is grace. What is Grace=\r\n? Awareness without the fragmentary ego. How can one know that there is suc=\r\nh a state? Only if one realizes it. The Vedas laud such a one as having rea=\r\nlized God and become one with Him.=C2=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Th=\r\nerefore the greatest good that one can derive from the world and the greate=\r\nst good which one can render unto it, is to realize this state.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=\r\n=A0In fact, there are no states besides this. They appear in the state of i=\r\ngnorance. For him who knows, there is one state only. You are that.&lt;div sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;clear:both;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margi=\r\nn-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51,=\r\n 51);font-size:87%;margin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;mar=\r\ngin-left:0px;line-height:1.3em&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;...
