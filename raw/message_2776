And, no sadhana is successful \nwithout some minimal level of control over mind and emotions to start with!! \nThere lies the paradox. This is an egg first or chicken first kind of \nsituation. Just keep doing whatever sadhana you do (e.g. homam or japam) and \ntry to break through. Until you break through, sadhana will be a routine and \nwill work slowly. Once you break through, you will start making progress.\n\nApart from formal sadhana, keep control over your mind and emotions as much \nas you can, in all your activities. That is the key. Nothing is worth \ndesiring and nothing is worth hating in this universe. This body is like a \ntemporary house in which you live while you take care of your \nresponsibilities (karmik debts) in the town (on earth). Take decent care of \nthe house (body), but do not be attached to it. Discharge your \nresponsibilities to the best of your ability. Once you do something, \nsurrender the action and its doership to the lord and disengage from it, \ni.e. stop thinking about it. Always focus your mental energy on deciding \nwhat to do and on doing what you decided to do, rather than worrying about \npast or furutre or worrying about what others are doing. Focus on what you \ncan and should do.\n\nAs you discharge more and more responsibilities and as your sense of \nownership over your actions goes down, the clarity with which you can see \nyour responsibilities will increase considerably.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;chaudhuri.krishnendu&quot; &lt;krishnenduchdhr@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, October 02, 2009 7:33 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Respected Narasimhaji\n\n\n&gt; It is my earnest request to you and Respected Manish Panditji that each \n&gt; weekend if you put some notes or advises to young spiritual aspirants here \n&gt; about the problems that can arise for a sadhaka and how to overcome them \n&gt; from the very basic level to gradually advance levels it wil be highly \n&gt; beneficial to the spiritual community and specially to young aspirants \n&gt; like me and to those who have yet not got a Guru but are striving in the \n&gt; path.I understand that it would not be possible to disclose all details of \n&gt; sadhana on the net still whatever comes from your side and specially \n&gt; Manishji I think will be highly beneficial.If Manishji permises i will \n&gt; request you Narasimhaji to give it a GO.\n\n\n"}}
