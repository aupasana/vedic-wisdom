Those with a \nbetter or different understanding may kindly ignore my 2 cents. I am \ncertainly not an expert in this area.\n\n*         *         *\n\nAll Mahavidyas are different aspects of Shakti at different stages of \nevolution in the *very early* Creation cycle, i.e. when field of duality \nis just about to emanate from non-dual Self. When Shakti is just about \nto separate from Shiva and engage in a Play. Of course, understanding of \nCreation is also the key to Dissolution or Liberation (reverse process)! \nThus, Mahavidyas represent subtle knowledge related to the creation and \nholding together of the field of duality and are also the keys to \novercoming it.\n\nI will go through Mahavidyas in the order in which they are found in \nmost literature.\n\n*         *         *\n\nAadyaa (Kaali) represents the state of shakti just after Shiva and \nShakti separated and the field of duality is just about to spring from \nnon-dual Self. This primordial energy is fierce, intense, disorderly and \nuncontrolled and that is seen in a lot of symbols associated with Kaali.\n\nWhen this primordial energy decides to give rise to the field of duality \nand Creation, it becomes Taaraa. Though very similar to Kaali (one \nTantra even says, with a bit of hyperbole, that Kaali and Taaraa are the \nsame and one distinguishing between them will go to hell!), She has an \nadded compassion and Motherly aspect.\n\nWhen this shakti becomes more orderly and masterfully contemplates the \nmasterplan for the way entire duality should operate, it becomes Shodasi \n(Lalita Tripurasundari).\n\nWhen this shakti plans how various worlds (realms of awareness) operate \nand interact within this duality, it becomes Bhuvaneswari.\n\nWhen this shakti contemplates how the field of duality to be created \nwould recycle itself and keep going continuously (i.e. how objects are \ndestroyed and then re-created), it becomes Bhairavi.\n\nWhen this shakti contemplates how Self would manifest as various objects \nin the field of duality and engage in give and take to make the field of \nduality sustainable and self-sufficient, and, at the same time, make \neach object in the field of duality a microcosm of the *entire* field, \nwith that fact concealed by a false identity in each object, it becomes \nVajra Vairochani (Chhinnamasta).\n\nWhen this shakti contemplates how to make the objects in the field of \nduality immerse themselves in duality with awareness of underlying \nnon-dual Self completely masked off, it becomes Dhoomavati. (Note: So \nshe is also the key to reversing it). That&#39;s why she is a widow and some \nstories describe her as eating her own Shiva.\n\nWhen this shakti contemplates how the field of duality would restrain \nbeings from escaping it (e.g. various internal enemies and pashas), it \nbecomes Valga. With some corruption, the Vedic name Valga (meaning: \nbridle or rein!) became Bagla. Of course, she is the key to \nunderstanding and overcoming those restraints that keep us tied in \nduality.\n\nWhen this shakti contemplates how the field of duality would mesmerize \nbeings with its variety and keep them trapped in it due to the curiosity \nto understand more of it, it becomes Maatangi.\n\nWhen this shakti contemplates how to keep the beings happy and fulfilled \nand keep them engaged in the field of duality, it then becomes Kamala.\n\n*         *         *\n\nThus, ten Mahavidyas reprsent subtle knowledge related to how duality \ncomes into being and functions and how beings in duality are kept in \nduality.\n\nThe way I have written it, it may sound like there is a hierarchy and \nsuperiority/inferiority, but that is misleading. Concept in one&#39;s mind \nof a house to build, plan of the house on paper, a 3D replica of the \nhouse and the final house - they have different purposes at different \nstages. To someone, house may be more important than papers. To an \narchitect, seeing the house may be useless and plan papers may be more \nimportant. All the mahavidyas are covering slightly different aspects of \nhow duality operates and a perfect understanding of any aspect may take \none towards liberation. There is a lot of overlap too. In any case, \ndepending on one&#39;s orientation, one of them may be better. But, overall, \nthere is no real hierarchy.\n\nIn any case, as I said in previous mails, Mahavidyas are for removing \nthe final vestiges of conditioning in the final stages of one&#39;s \nspiritual sadhana. The current practice in some circles of prescribing a \nMahavidya sadhana for routine things such as getting married, getting a \njob, winning a court case etc, are not based on a wise and correct \nunderstanding.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n\n"}}
