Forgive me if this sounds ridiculous. I was wonderin=\r\ng how Deep Sleep / Coma and Samadhi are related or similar in nature.\nAltho=\r\nugh I have not experienced samadhi in any form but have managed to concentr=\r\nate intensely for shorter periods of time during japams and homams. Here ar=\r\ne a few thoughts of mine. Kindly let me know your opinion.\n\n1) Can we compa=\r\nre a person in deep sleep with a person in Samadhi (nirvikalpa or otherwise=\r\n) ? \nIn both cases the person becomes unaware of the physical surroundings =\r\nand sees images , hears sounds etc(as per the accounts of Pandit Gopi Krish=\r\nna)\nHe can smell fragrances, feel transported to a different world and even=\r\n speak to persons ,deities , beings.\n\n2) There have been instances where pe=\r\nople after being in Coma have come back to life. During coma these people h=\r\nave experienced out of body experiences like seeing their own body from out=\r\nside, floating in air etc.. all very similar to what Ramakrishna and Gopi k=\r\nrishan mention in their accounts when they experienced samadhi.\n\nAgain plea=\r\nse forgive me if this analogy is totally outrageous or plain stupid . But I=\r\n felt I need to clarify this hence the post.\n\nThanks and Regards,\nGirish Su=\r\nndaram\n\n\n"}}
