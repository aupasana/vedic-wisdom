From Narayana was born Brahma. Fr=\r\nom Brahma=E2=80=99s mind was born Sage Vashistha, the reputed embodiment of=\r\n wisdom, the spiritual preceptor of the kings of Ayodhya. He gave us the Yo=\r\nga-Vashistha, the transcendental guide-light to humanity. Vashistha=E2=80=\r\n=99s son was Sakti. From Sakti was born sage Parasara. From Parasara was bo=\r\nrn Vyasa, the great Badarayana, or Krishna-Dvaipayana, who divided the Veda=\r\ns, and wrote the Mahabharata. Vyasa=E2=80=99s son was the ideal sage Suka D=\r\neva, who gave the Bhagavata to Parikshit. Suka was initiated into sannyasa =\r\nby Lord Shiva himself. Read the Suka-Rahasya Upanishad. You will find that =\r\nSuka was initiated into the Mahavakyas by Sadashiva at the request of Sri V=\r\nyasa Maharshi. The blood of Suka-Deva is said to run in the veins of Gaudap=\r\nada, the famous advaitic metaphysician, the father of Advaita-Vedanta.Gauda=\r\npada initiated Govindapada into sannyasa, who, in turn, initiated into sann=\r\nyasa Sri Shankara, the wondrous giant of Indian philosophy and religion. Sh=\r\nankara=E2=80=99s name will be remembered as long as the Divine Names of Ram=\r\na and Krishna will last in this world. But for the timely incarnation of Sh=\r\nankara the upanishadic wisdom would have sunk into oblivion. Glory to the g=\r\nreatest sannyasin, Shankara, the =E2=80=9CLoka-Shankara,=E2=80=9Dwho shower=\r\ned the rain of peace all over the land! \n\n\n"}}
