In my little=C2=A0understa=\r\nnding, it is the=C2=A0goal which is=C2=A0God-realization, which is the=C2=\r\n=A0only=C2=A0&quot;fundamental principle&quot;. Anything else is dispensable and ther=\r\nefore not eternal. Vedas, as all self-realized saints have told us, are abo=\r\nut eternal truths, nothing short. \n=C2=A0\nIt will be interesting here to po=\r\nint out that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadham=C2=\r\n=A0do the=C2=A0hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called panih=\r\nomam. Even the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum called &quot; =\r\nbrahmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to be performed on the r=\r\night hand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in the r=\r\night hand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is no de=\r\nfect here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that homa ca=\r\nn be perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem arise=\r\ns.\n=C2=A0\nThank you for the interesting example above. But I have a very pe=\r\nrtinent question regarding this.=C2=A0 And what exactly does it mean by say=\r\ning one learned in the Vedas? Can one, who=C2=A0has mugged up the Vedas and=\r\n a few commentaries of the same, without experiencing any sort of self-real=\r\nization, be called a &quot;srotriya&quot;? Does such a non-realized being have &quot;fire&quot;=\r\n in his right hand? Never! \n=C2=A0\nA real &quot;srotriya&quot; is one who has realize=\r\nd the Aatman, not in words, but in the states of samadhi. Such a being &quot;may=\r\n have&quot; spiritual abilities of fire in his &quot;palm&quot;. Anyone else, irrespective=\r\n of whether he is=C2=A0born in=C2=A0brhamin family, is merely following a b=\r\nlind tradition without having experienced anything and thus violating the e=\r\nssence of the Vedas and merely sticking to external rules which have no spi=\r\nritual consequence. What use is such=C2=A0a=C2=A0&#39;vedic&#39; rituals, if at all=\r\n they can be called as vedic. That which is devoide of the essence, is an e=\r\nmpty shell which is bound to reform or perish in the course of time. \n=C2=\r\n=A0\nTherefore, for me, it hardly matters if the ritual is done on the bare =\r\npalms or a gloved hands of a person who has never experienced the Self. Bot=\r\nh, are in clear violation of the Vedic essence.\n=C2=A0\nHomam is a ritualist=\r\nic form of worship and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn&#39;t work.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nThis is definitely incorrect! The vedic rishis were famous for doing=\r\n elaborate yagyas and homas. By extension of your above logic, it means the=\r\ny did not believe in Advaita since they used to engage themselves in homas =\r\nand yagyas?=C2=A0 \n=C2=A0\nVasistha spoke the Yoga Vasistham, which is a pin=\r\nnacle of advaitha princples, and Ramayana speaks of different yagyas perfor=\r\nmed by him and Vishwamitra.=C2=A0 Does it mean they did not &quot;believe&quot; in ad=\r\nvaita? \n=C2=A0\nYour above statement stems from an incorrect understanding o=\r\nf what is Advaitha Vada. As long as one is trapped in duality, merely sayin=\r\ng that I believe in Advaitha Vada does not make one become so. I can keep b=\r\nelieving that I am Bill Gates, but that=C2=A0won&#39;t make me Bill Gates. Rath=\r\ner=C2=A0I shall remain merely as a self deluded entity. Untill one actually=\r\n experiences the state of non-duality, theoritical talk of &quot;All- is Brahman=\r\n&quot; is self-delusion. \n=C2=A0\nAdwaith is a state to be achieve. It needs sust=\r\nained and serious sadhana. No wonder the Rishis of yore, who were all self-=\r\nrealized beings - and had experienced the state of=C2=A0Advaitha - used to =\r\nperform such long penances, including elaborate fire rituals on a daily bas=\r\nis. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nIt is not a question of whether it is more elaborate or =\r\nless elaborate or which is inferior or which is superior. It is a question =\r\nof whether it is correct and based on what vedic authority.\n=C2=A0\nThe ques=\r\ntion is not about being based on &quot;which vedic authority&quot; BUT, is the sadhan=\r\na bearing fruits? Is it transforming the individual? Irrespective of which =\r\nvedic &#39;authority&#39; says what, if a said sadhana is not leading to experianti=\r\nal knowledge and states, it is useless for a genuine sadhaka. Therefore, th=\r\ne only way to judge is to perform the sadhana and experience for oneself! A=\r\nnd this is why there are so many who are already doing the homas on a daily=\r\n basis. Some have experienced paritally, some are yet to. And each experien=\r\nce merely rivets one&#39;s mind to the sadhana more and more thus plunging in d=\r\neeper and deeper. A sadhaka has little use for dry theory. That which canno=\r\nt be experienced, is of no consequence. It is this perspective that any sad=\r\nhana, not just the ones mentioned by Narasimha, has to be judged by a genui=\r\nne sadhaka. \n=C2=A0\n\n2. &quot;What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not=\r\n know any.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nAre there different ways you teach a person to fly an ae=\r\nroplane depending on what he knows and what he does ?\n=C2=A0\nThe flying of =\r\nthe aeroplane is the same. The way one can learn is different based on the =\r\ndifferent models of the aeroplanes in which one learns to fly!\n=C2=A0\n3. &quot;K=\r\nnowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can never be absolute. It ev=\r\nolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing impure or corrupt about =\r\nit.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nRituals do evolve around desa and kaala but if it starts evolvi=\r\nng around paatra it is a dangerous trend.\n=C2=A0\nPaatra is a product of the=\r\n desa and kaala, not uninfluenced by the other two. That is why these three=\r\n are used in tandem. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n4. &quot;The only knowledge that should (and=\r\n can) be preserved without corruption is knowledge that is *absolute*.

Selective words from here and there really do not prove that t=\r\nhe Vedas are merely a set of rituals! This kind of an intepretation leads t=\r\no a fallacy where-in one celebrated western commentator on the Vedas believ=\r\nes that the Purusha shukta in an example of human-scarfice practised in the=\r\n Vedas. I am sure you will disagree with this. \n=C2=A0\nCan you kindly enlig=\r\nhten us, why is Usha accorded an elevated status? Usha is merely a dawn. Wh=\r\nat is so big deal about an average dawn, so much so that one needs to addre=\r\nss hymns to it? Or for that matter other pantheon of Vedic deities from the=\r\n Rig Vedas, which to the cursory reader, gives an impression of mere nature=\r\n worshipping pagan&#39;s attempting elevated poetry? And if the average word by=\r\n by word translations or a core ritualistic view=C2=A0is all there is to th=\r\ne Vedas, pray enlighten, why is there is a gap in the philosophical structu=\r\nre between the so called pre-historic vedic hymns vs that of the Upanishadi=\r\nc period? And all the Upanishads seems to claim all philosphical authority =\r\nfrom the Vedas itself? How can this gap in the understanding of the two con=\r\ntexts be bridged, unless one takes an allegorical view of the recordings of=\r\n=C2=A0 the Vedas, just like in the case of pre classical Greek orphic-myths=\r\n and their later day derivatives?\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n\nAny path, vedic, agamic, y=\r\nogic, tantrik, aghori,=C2=A0if rightly followed exclusively and fully can l=\r\nead to the desired objective=C2=A0.

Sanjay Rath, who has been a constant source of en=\r\nlightenment, \nencouragement and inspiration. I am eternally grateful to him=\r\n&quot;\n=C2=A0\nand now you say\n=C2=A0\n&quot;In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got =\r\nsome specific secrets and some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, =\r\nlike with all other paramparas) from his elders. He then read some books an=\r\nd formed his understanding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of=\r\n adulation for the &quot;parampara secrets&quot;. I am afraid he got addicted to the =\r\nadulation and started to manufacture &quot;parampara secrets&quot; after the initial =\r\nrun. Slowly he became commercial and he started selling manufactured &quot;param=\r\npara knowledge&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nYes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophiza=\r\ntion, which is really superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. His=\r\n theories are like beautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanjay =\r\nji always maintains an air of &quot;I know more, but will teach later&quot;. It is co=\r\nnvenient to give the impression that there is more. If anything does not ma=\r\nke sense, it could be because you have to learn more!\n=C2=A0\nAs he started =\r\nexploiting and commercializing half-baked and ill-conceived knowledge in th=\r\ne name of a parampara, I took an exception to the commercialization and dis=\r\nhonesty. After expressing my reservations privately and having no effect, I=\r\n started to go public, first subtly and later bluntly. After several clashe=\r\ns, I was kicked out of SJC.\n=C2=A0\nWith basic concepts like houses, arudha =\r\npadas, chara karakas, argalas etc, the generic guidelines he received are i=\r\nmperfect. He deviates from Parasara in several matters and his teachings do=\r\n not work consistently.\n=C2=A0\nBottomline: Sanjay ji&#39;s base is made of some=\r\n specific secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that ar=\r\ne imperfect too). Starting from that base and reading books, he hastily cre=\r\nated a body of knowledge which he sells now. If there is anything in his te=\r\nachings that can be used relatively reliably, it is TP.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nIn 2000 you=\r\n said\n=C2=A0\n\n&quot;Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It is a phalita=\r\n dasa. It shows general\n\nresults. Narayana dasa is computed differently for=\r\n different divisional charts and we \ncan use Narayana dasa of a divisional =\r\nchart to predict matters related to that \ndivisional chart. \n=C2=A0 \nNaraya=\r\nna dasa is based on the progression of lagna in one=E2=80=99s life. As one =\r\ndasa ends \nand another starts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna an=\r\nd another rasi \nbecomes one=E2=80=99s progressed lagna. Using the progresse=\r\nd lagna as the reference, we \nfind out the events that happen in that dasa.=\r\n Thus we get twelve charts for each \nperson, with each chart applicable in =\r\none dasa. \n=C2=A0 \nThis is a very versatile dasa system and readers sould p=\r\nay attention to the details of \ncalculation. &quot;\n=C2=A0\nnow you say\n=C2=A0\n&quot;N=\r\narayana dasa may be based on some genuine parampara knowledge, but it does =\r\nnot work with any level of consistency. I am afraid it needs refinement.&quot;\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nYou seem to start teaching even before you=C2=A0start learning.=C2=\r\n=A0I&#39; m only afraid it should not happen in the context of vedic rituals al=\r\nso.

It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. =\r\nThere is nothing impure or corrupt about it.\n\nAt the end of the day, the ke=\r\ny is whether one is actually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or not, =\r\nwhether it is causing internal transformation in one or not, and whether it=\r\n helps in one&#39;s spiritual progress or not.\n\n* * *\n\nLet me cut & paste a sec=\r\ntion from a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an analog=\r\ny given earlier and addresses some relevant issues.\n\n------------ ---------=\r\n --------\nDo Vedas Describe External Rituals\n\nSome people believe that Veda=\r\n describes the specifics about various external yagyas. Veda is supposed to=\r\n be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa-ka=\r\nala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific external rituals be unbound by=\r\n desa-kaala-paatra?\n\nThough Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrated commentary on=\r\n RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a different take in =\r\nhis =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that Veda talks about=\r\n absolute truths about the inner self and not relative truths about externa=\r\nl matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That is why it is the i=\r\nmmortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything that is perishable an=\r\nd purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the divine Will, vario=\r\nus offerings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=80=99s conditioning =\r\nand the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and desires.\n\nMetaphor: Ved=\r\nic Homam vs Aagamic Homam\n\nNotions that so and so yagya ritual is sanctione=\r\nd by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya ritual is not sanctioned by V=\r\neda can be put in perspective using a metaphor.\n\nOnce there were many peopl=\r\ne who lived near the sea [Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoye=\r\nd the sight and sound of the sea [absorbed in Aatman most of the time]. The=\r\ny described the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].\n\nAs people started l=\r\niving a little away from the sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to=\r\n put together some instructions on how to reach the sea. He said, &quot;keep wal=\r\nking towards east&quot; and the instructions grew with time. People faithfully f=\r\nollowed the instructions [rituals].\n\nPeople started moving further and furt=\r\nher inland and started living in a landlocked desert far away from the sea.=\r\n This generation had never seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a se=\r\na. They faithfully performed the ritual of walking towards east, but did no=\r\nt find sea. They debated endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two =\r\nmiles or three miles and formed different schools of thought. Some walked t=\r\nheir chosen distance, found a tree or a building or some interesting object=\r\n and even became satisfied that that was sea!\n\nThen came some great person,=\r\n whose instincts led him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for=\r\n a long distance [use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few mont=\r\nhs. He put together newer instructions to reach the sea, which included rid=\r\ning a horse [new =C3=A4gama and tantra].\n\nPeople performing the old rituals=\r\n objected to this and said &quot;but then this horse thing is not granted by the=\r\n book of sea. This is a new path and different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; =\r\n[pure Vedic ritual]. By now, people did not even understand what the crypti=\r\nc poems of the original &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed that t=\r\nhose poems taught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were used to. They w=\r\nere blissfully unaware that the original instructions were meant for someon=\r\ne already close to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who act=\r\nually saw the sea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the=\r\n sea from there!\n\nSlowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, ch=\r\nariots etc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead =\r\nof just instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra=\r\n/ yantras].\n\nOne particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and =\r\nother dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though=\r\n the distance to sea was much shorter through that jungle, it was just too =\r\ndangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. There were crue=\r\nl dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many we=\r\nak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew =\r\nthe entire territory well came forward, condemned that path and discouraged=\r\n people from trying that path. Since then, even people who were strong enou=\r\ngh to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.\n\nAs time progress=\r\ned, people started fighting too much about whose path was superior. They we=\r\nre foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either =\r\nthe so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-called &quot;new&quot; path or other variatio=\r\nns, for the changed geography and changed times. Many followed the instruct=\r\nions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know =\r\nthat &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They onl=\r\ny thought they were supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and ther=\r\ne was no need to adopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They=\r\n even condemned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated =\r\ndirections for their place and time, for violating tradition.\n\nIn case the =\r\nanalogy is not clear, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about =\r\nrealizing self. Vedic deities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, B=\r\nrihaspati etc are slightly different aspects of Aatman. Veda describes vari=\r\nous aspects of the state of self-realization. That is why it is considered =\r\nthe highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible w=\r\nays to reach that state. While definitive and absolute statements can be ma=\r\nde on the actual state of self-realization itself, no definitive statements=\r\n can be made on how to reach it. Only relative statements can be made based=\r\n on desa-kaala-paatra. The path depends on one&#39;s current position!\n\nGreat m=\r\nen in many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came,=\r\n experienced that state, understood the current state of people around them=\r\n and gave specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current=\r\n state. Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some inst=\r\nead kept arguing about the contradictions between paths.\n\nStop Arguing and =\r\nDo Sadhana\n\nAs the metaphor above illustrates, arguments about various path=\r\ns are irrelevant and distracting. What is important is to pick a path and f=\r\nollow it. Whether one does a Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary=\r\n issue. The primary issues are whether one does homam or not, how focused o=\r\nne is, how one=E2=80=99s focus is improving and how one is being transforme=\r\nd internally.\n\nJust as a twenty course meal eaten once every six months doe=\r\ns not give much energy to one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another rit=\r\nual done once every six months or a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiri=\r\ntual or material pursuits. Just as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eat=\r\nen everyday gives more energy to one, a small 20-30 minute homam done every=\r\nday gives a boost to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.\n\nWise Tradeoffs\n\nSu=\r\nppose the president of the country is visiting one for lunch with 100 assoc=\r\niates. One can invite all the 100 associates of the President by name and s=\r\neat them in the room individually, following various protocols. Then one ca=\r\nn exchange long pleasantries with the President and then offer lunch.\n\nSupp=\r\nose one is in a hurry and has very little time. If one still invites all th=\r\ne 100 associates by name and seats them in the room individually following =\r\nthe protocol and does not have enough time to let the President eat lunch i=\r\nn the end, is it a wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 asso=\r\nciates together and seat them together by violating the protocol and use th=\r\nat time to let the President eat in peace?\n\nSimilarly, is it wise if one ex=\r\nchanges long pleasantries and gives very little time to eat? Or should one =\r\ncut short on the pleasantries and give more time to eat?\n\nIn a fire ritual,=\r\n making offerings to the main deity is the primary part. Various upacharas =\r\ndone to the deity before the offerings commence is secondary. Various preli=\r\nminary and final steps and offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If =\r\none has a few hours for the fire ritual, one can do everything given in scr=\r\niptures leisurely. If one has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise tr=\r\nadeoffs and maximize the benefit. It is far better than doing nothing.\n\n&lt;se=\r\nctions deleted&gt;\n\nProof of the Pudding\n\nAt this time, more than hundred peop=\r\nle are doing a homam to some deity or the other, everyday. Spending time wo=\r\nrshipping god in fire for 20-30 min (or more) everyday, with an attitude of=\r\n surrender and with some basic intellectual understanding of the absolute t=\r\nruths expounded by Veda and Upanishads, can do a world of good to one=E2=80=\r\n=99s spiritual evolution. The proof of the pudding is in eating it. One can=\r\n try to perform a short homam everyday for a few months and see for oneself=\r\n if there is a difference in one=E2=80=99s attitude, focus and clarity of t=\r\nhinking.\n------------ --------- --------\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nFree Jyotish Softwa=\r\nre, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals=\r\n for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nFilms t=\r\nhat make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\nSpirituality: http://grou=\r\nps. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.c=\r\nom/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- -\n\n---- moulamagamagguru &lt;moulamagamagguru@ yahoo.in&gt; wrote:=\r\n \n&gt; Dear Members,\n&gt; \n&gt; At the outset, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for gui=\r\nding me into this forum. I had posted a message in jHora in response to a f=\r\norward from Jyotishwritings on &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree that =\r\njHora is not the right forum for discussing these topics.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have gone =\r\nthrough the homam manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a hom=\r\nam being performed and have the following observations to make.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. As =\r\nper rules laid out by srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the preocedur=\r\nes for various rituals, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the dars=\r\napoornamasa (which is the prakruti of all yajnas).\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. All steps in dar=\r\nsapoornamasa should be there in the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee=\r\n or amantraka form, but it has to be there). We are nobody to judge which a=\r\nre essential and which are not essential. They are laid down by vedas and l=\r\nater elaborated by acharyas.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. There are variations in procedures in =\r\nthe different sutras such as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana su=\r\ntra etc., but no omissions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. The ordinary materials such as fire woo=\r\nd, grains, ghee etc. become worthy of divine usage only when they are divin=\r\nised using the right procedure. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. Ot=\r\nherwise it is only a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as named. I suggest reading of the volum=\r\nnous work &quot;Agni&quot; by Frits Staal to get a insight into the importance of the=\r\nse steps.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5. The procedure in the manual is not as laid out by any of =\r\nthe sutras. There are large deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix o=\r\nf vedic and tantrik procedures. \n&gt; \n&gt; 6. In paristarana or laying the darbh=\r\na aorund the kunda there is a particular manner in which the tips of succee=\r\nding darbhas are tucked under the bottom of the prceeding ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7. The=\r\n direction for sprinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva =\r\nsavita prasuva&quot; ie:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. This ca=\r\nn not be because apasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starting f=\r\nrom NE corner and ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).\n&gt; \n&gt; 8 Patraasa=\r\ndanam or keeping the vessels and ladles used in the vessel above darbha is =\r\nmissing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 9.Prokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purification of the=\r\n utensils is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 10. Patra samskaram or purifying the utensils is=\r\n missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 11. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, varuna =\r\npoojanam and aacchadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is missing.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; 12. Brahma varanam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 13. Ajya=\r\n samskaram or purification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the homa drav=\r\nya used for havan is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 14. Darvee samskaram or purification of =\r\nladles used in the homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be used (sruks=\r\nruvou) .\n&gt; \n&gt; 15. Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 16=\r\n. Idhma pradanam or placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni iis m=\r\nissing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 17. It is seen in the video that with a single dip of the ladl=\r\ne in the ghee, multiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity =\r\nof ghee to be given in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; and many more ............\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic proc=\r\nedure the deity is not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda an=\r\nd he acts as carrier for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the na=\r\nme of deity pronounced in satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the par=\r\nticular deity. If at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not ne=\r\ncessary)\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. In the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the k=\r\nunda and the agni acts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni it=\r\nself is converted into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agn=\r\ni devata aikya ahutis.\n&gt; \n&gt; 19. Very good alternate homa procedures are ava=\r\nilable in the mantra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for =\r\nsadhakas. They don&#39;t involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t have to struggl=\r\ne to get the right pronunciation and svaras. These procedures are designed =\r\nfor mantra sadhakas who perform homam on their own. They can be easily adap=\r\nted to perfrom homam for any devata.\n&gt; \n&gt; 20. Homam should not be seen as a=\r\n 20 minute Jane Fonda work out that can be learned from a video. It involve=\r\ns learning from an able guru and practice with devotion, precision and perf=\r\nection.\n&gt; \n&gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its=\r\n own purity. Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty help t=\r\no preserve knowledge uncorrupted.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-346897504-1277034162=:37345\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv129442715&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste Sindhu j=\r\ni,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Although this mail is addressed to Narasimh=\r\na, I had a few points to make since the mail is in the forum.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;and do not violate the fundamental principles of vedic =\r\nrituals.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;What exactly is the &quot;fu=\r\nndamental principles&quot; of a vedic ritual? In my little&nbsp;understanding, i=\r\nt is the&nbsp;goal which is&nbsp;God-realization, which is the&nbsp;only&nb=\r\nsp;&quot;fundamental principle&quot;. Anything else is dispensable and therefore not =\r\neternal. Vedas, as all self-realized saints have told us, are about eternal=\r\n truths, nothing short. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;It will be intere=\r\nsting here to point out that when some sections of samavedis when they perf=\r\norm sraadham&nbsp;do the&nbsp;hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It =\r\nis called panihomam. Even the fire is not present there. It is based on a d=\r\nictum called &quot; brahmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to be per=\r\nformed on the right hand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever p=\r\nresent in the right hand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin.=\r\n There is no defect here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and s=\r\nay that homa can be perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then th=\r\ne problem arises.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for =\r\nthe interesting example above. But I have a very pertinent question regardi=\r\nng this.&nbsp; And what exactly does it mean by saying one learned in the V=\r\nedas? Can one, who&nbsp;has mugged up the Vedas and a few commentaries of t=\r\nhe same, without experiencing any sort of self-realization, be called a &quot;sr=\r\notriya&quot;? Does such a non-realized being have &quot;fire&quot; in his right hand? Neve=\r\nr! &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;A real &quot;srotriya&quot; is one who has &lt;EM&gt;reali=\r\nzed &lt;/EM&gt;the Aatman, not in words, but in the states of samadhi. Such a bei=\r\nng &quot;may have&quot; spiritual abilities of fire in his &quot;palm&quot;. Anyone else, irres=\r\npective of whether he is&nbsp;born in&nbsp;brhamin family, is merely follow=\r\ning a blind tradition without having experienced anything and thus violatin=\r\ng the essence of the Vedas and merely sticking to external rules which have=\r\n no spiritual consequence. What use is such&nbsp;a&nbsp;&#39;vedic&#39; rituals, if=\r\n at all they can be called as vedic. That which is devoide of the essence, =\r\nis an empty shell which is bound to reform or perish in the course of time.=\r\n &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Therefore, for me, it hardly matters if the =\r\nritual is done on the bare palms or a gloved hands of a person who has neve=\r\nr experienced the Self. Both, are in clear violation of the Vedic essence.&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Homam is a ritualistic form of worship and=\r\n if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn&#39;t work.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/=\r\nEM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;This is definitely incorrect! The vedic rishis were fa=\r\nmous for doing elaborate yagyas and homas. By extension of your above logic=\r\n, it means they did not believe in Advaita since they used to engage themse=\r\nlves in homas and yagyas?&nbsp; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Vasistha spok=\r\ne the Yoga Vasistham, which is a pinnacle of advaitha princples, and Ramaya=\r\nna speaks of different yagyas performed by him and Vishwamitra.&nbsp; Does =\r\nit mean they did not &quot;believe&quot; in advaita? &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Yo=\r\nur above statement stems from an incorrect understanding of what is Advaith=\r\na Vada. As long as one is trapped in duality, merely saying that I believe =\r\nin Advaitha Vada does not make one become so. I can keep believing that I a=\r\nm Bill Gates, but that&nbsp;won&#39;t make me Bill Gates. Rather&nbsp;I shall r=\r\nemain merely as a self deluded entity. Untill one actually experiences the =\r\nstate of non-duality, theoritical talk of &quot;All- is Brahman&quot; is self-delusio=\r\nn. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Adwaith is a state to be achieve. It needs=\r\n sustained and serious sadhana. No wonder the Rishis of yore, who were all =\r\nself-realized beings - and had experienced the state of&nbsp;Advaitha - use=\r\nd to perform such long penances, including elaborate fire rituals on a dail=\r\ny basis. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;It is=\r\n not a question of whether it is more elaborate or less elaborate or which =\r\nis inferior or which is superior. It is a question of whether it is correct=\r\n and based on what vedic authority.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;The question is not about being based on &quot;which vedic authority&quot; BUT, i=\r\ns the sadhana bearing fruits? Is it transforming the individual? Irrespecti=\r\nve of which vedic &#39;authority&#39; says what, if a said sadhana is not leading t=\r\no experiantial knowledge and states, it is useless for a genuine sadhaka. T=\r\nherefore, the only way to judge is to perform the sadhana and experience fo=\r\nr oneself! And this is why there are so many who are already doing the homa=\r\ns on a daily basis. Some have experienced paritally, some are yet to. And e=\r\nach experience merely rivets one&#39;s mind to the sadhana more and more thus p=\r\nlunging in deeper and deeper. A sadhaka has little use for dry theory. That=\r\n which cannot be experienced, is of no consequence. It is this perspective =\r\nthat any sadhana, not just the ones mentioned by Narasimha, has to be judge=\r\nd by a genuine sadhaka. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;2.=\r\n &quot;What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know any.&quot;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Are there different ways you teach a pe=\r\nrson to fly an aeroplane depending on what he knows and what he does ?&lt;/EM&gt;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The flying of the aeroplane is the s=\r\name. The way one can learn is different based on the different models of th=\r\ne aeroplanes in which one learns to fly!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;3=\r\n. &quot;Knowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can never be absolute. I=\r\nt evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing impure or corrupt ab=\r\nout it.&quot;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Rituals do evolve a=\r\nround desa and kaala but if it starts evolving around paatra it is a danger=\r\nous trend.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Paatra is a product o=\r\nf the desa and kaala, not uninfluenced by the other two. That is why these =\r\nthree are used in tandem. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\nEM&gt;4. &quot;The only knowledge that should (and can) be preserved without corrup=\r\ntion is knowledge that is *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperishabl=\r\ne Self, alone is absolute knowledge. Knowledge of *external rituals* is rel=\r\native and can never be absolute&quot;.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Sir, honestly, have you ever read the vedas to know what is inside th=\r\nem ? or for that matter the Sayana bhashya&lt;/EM&gt;. &lt;EM&gt;other than in the ritu=\r\nalistic context. I am quoting the above mantras because they are commonly k=\r\nnown.&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;This is the precisely the reason why maybe a Vivekananda had clearly state=\r\nd that the available interpretations of the Vedas do not do justice to it&#39;s=\r\n essence. Selective words from here and there really do not prove that the =\r\nVedas are merely a set of rituals! This kind of an intepretation leads to a=\r\n fallacy where-in one celebrated western commentator on the Vedas believes =\r\nthat the Purusha shukta in an example of human-scarfice practised in the Ve=\r\ndas. I am sure you will disagree with this. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;C=\r\nan you kindly enlighten us, why is Usha accorded an elevated status? Usha i=\r\ns merely a dawn. What is so big deal about an average dawn, so much so that=\r\n one needs to address hymns to it? Or for that matter other pantheon of Ved=\r\nic deities from the Rig Vedas, which to the cursory reader, gives an impres=\r\nsion of mere nature worshipping pagan&#39;s attempting elevated poetry? And if =\r\nthe average word by by word translations or a core ritualistic view&nbsp;is=\r\n all there is to the Vedas, pray enlighten, why is there is a gap in the ph=\r\nilosophical structure between the so called pre-historic vedic hymns vs tha=\r\nt of the Upanishadic period? And all the Upanishads seems to claim all phil=\r\nosphical authority from the Vedas itself? How can this gap in the understan=\r\nding of the two contexts be bridged, unless one takes an allegorical view o=\r\nf the recordings of&nbsp; the Vedas, just like in the case of pre classical=\r\n Greek orphic-myths and their later day derivatives?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;Any path, vedic, agamic, yogic,=\r\n tantrik, aghori,&nbsp;if rightly followed exclusively and fully can lead t=\r\no the desired objective&nbsp;. But mixing up of paths could be disastrous.&lt;=\r\n/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;No. Many self-realized people have =\r\n&#39;mixed&#39; these artifically created boundaried and achived and experienced hi=\r\ngher states.

If so, which authoritative text have you relied upon? Or is=\r\n it one designed by yourself keeping the convenience factor in mind ?&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;There are many procedures even within the vedic sys=\r\ntem for performing homam. Each established procedure given by acharyas&nbsp=\r\n; is complete&nbsp;in itself and do not violate the fundamental principles =\r\nof vedic rituals.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;It will be interesting here =\r\nto point out that when some sections of samavedis when they perform sraadha=\r\nm&nbsp;do the&nbsp;hormam on the palm of the bhokta brahmin. It is called p=\r\nanihomam. Even the fire is not present there. It is based on a dictum calle=\r\nd &quot; brahmanasya dakshine haste hotavyam&quot; - the homa is to be performed on t=\r\nhe right hand of the brahmin. It is believed that agni is ever present in t=\r\nhe right hand of the srotriya (one learned in the veda) brahmin. There is n=\r\no defect here. It is as per sastra. Now if you modify this and say that hom=\r\na can be perfromed on the right glove worn by a brahmin, then the problem a=\r\nrises.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As you have said, any system of worship=\r\n is acceptable. There are so many religions and cults all around the world.=\r\n Nobody objects. If you call something vedic, please make sure that it conf=\r\norms to the vedic tenets.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Homam is a ritualist=\r\nic form of worship and if you bring in advaita vada in it it doesn&#39;t work.&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;It is not a question of whether it is more ela=\r\nborate or less elaborate or which is inferior or which is superior. It is a=\r\n question of whether it is correct and based on what vedic authority. If yo=\r\nu are promoting this homa procedure as one of your own design, there is no =\r\nobjection. On the contrary, if you need the sanction of vedic authority for=\r\n it, please&nbsp;answer within the ambit of vedic knowledge&nbsp;if doubts =\r\nare raised.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The apprehension is that in the ye=\r\nar 2000 you said,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTimes-Roman&gt;\n&lt;P align=\r\n=3Dleft&gt;&quot;I cannot possibly finish this preface without expressing my deep g=\r\nratitude for my \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;guru Pt. Sanjay Rath, who has been a const=\r\nant source of enlightenment, \n&lt;DIV&gt;encouragement and inspiration. I am eter=\r\nnally grateful to him&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;and now you say&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some speci=\r\nfic secrets and some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, like with =\r\nall other paramparas) from his elders. He then read some books and formed h=\r\nis understanding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of adulation=\r\n for the &quot;parampara secrets&quot;. I am afraid he got addicted to the adulation =\r\nand started to manufacture &quot;parampara secrets&quot; after the initial run. Slowl=\r\ny he became commercial and he started selling manufactured &quot;parampara knowl=\r\nedge&quot;.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Yes, his teachings contain fascinating =\r\nphilosophization, which is really superficial and does not stand any real s=\r\ncrutiny. His theories are like beautiful structures built with a pack of ca=\r\nrds. Sanjay ji always maintains an air of &quot;I know more, but will teach late=\r\nr&quot;. It is convenient to give the impression that there is more. If anything=\r\n does not make sense, it could be because you have to learn more!&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;As he started exploiting and commercializing half-baked=\r\n and ill-conceived knowledge in the name of a parampara, I took an exceptio=\r\nn to the commercialization and dishonesty. After expressing my reservations=\r\n privately and having no effect, I started to go public, first subtly and l=\r\nater bluntly. After several clashes, I was kicked out of SJC.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;With basic concepts like houses, arudha padas, chara karaka=\r\ns, argalas etc, the generic guidelines he received are imperfect. He deviat=\r\nes from Parasara in several matters and his teachings do not work consisten=\r\ntly.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Bottomline: Sanjay ji&#39;s base is made of s=\r\nome specific secrets (that are imperfect) and some generic guidelines (that=\r\n are imperfect too). Starting from that base and reading books, he hastily =\r\ncreated a body of knowledge which he sells now. If there is anything in his=\r\n teachings that can be used relatively reliably, it is TP.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;In 2000 you said&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DTi=\r\nmes-Roman&gt;\n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;&quot;Narayana dasa is a very important rasi dasa.

Narayana dasa is computed differently for different divis=\r\nional charts and we \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;can use Narayana dasa of a divisional =\r\nchart to predict matters related to that \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;divisional chart.=\r\n \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;Narayana dasa is based on the pro=\r\ngression of lagna in one=E2=80=99s life. As one dasa ends \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;=\r\nand another starts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna and another r=\r\nasi \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;becomes one=E2=80=99s progressed lagna. Using the prog=\r\nressed lagna as the reference, we \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;find out the events that=\r\n happen in that dasa. Thus we get twelve charts for each \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;p=\r\nerson, with each chart applicable in one dasa. \n&lt;P align=3Dleft&gt;&nbsp; \n&lt;P =\r\nalign=3Dleft&gt;This is a very versatile dasa system and readers sould pay att=\r\nention to the details of \n&lt;DIV&gt;calculation. &quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;=\r\nnow you say&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&quot;Narayana dasa may be based=\r\n on some genuine parampara knowledge, but it does not work with any level o=\r\nf consistency. I am afraid it needs refinement.&quot;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;You seem to start teaching even before you&nbsp;start learning.&nbsp;I&#39; =\r\nm only afraid it should not happen in the context of vedic rituals also.

There are many standard h=\r\nomam procedures in the world today, some more elaborate than what we teach =\r\nand some more brief. I do not care exactly what procedure one uses and I wi=\r\nll be happy if more and more people do homam *regularly*, irrespective of t=\r\nhe exact procedure used! What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not=\r\n know any. If you are initiated into a different procedure that you can do =\r\ndaily, please go ahead and do it daily the way you know it. That will make =\r\nus very happy. However, if the method you know cannot be done daily, please=\r\n consider what I taught, which is simple enough to do daily.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Suppose there are rules and protocols on how one should serve lunch t=\r\no one&#39;s parents, e.g. how to place the plates, spoons, forks, soup bowls, d=\r\nrink cups, dessert bowls etc and how and in what order to serve various ite=\r\nms in those containers. Suppose the protocol is so complex that one cannot\n=\r\n do it everyday and calls one&#39;s parents for a lunch once every few months.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Is that better or is it better to relax the rules and protocols to m=\r\nake it less formal and serve lunch to parents everyday?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own pu=\r\nrity.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Hybrids may not always yield good results. Let almighty help =\r\nto preserve&lt;BR&gt;&gt; knowledge uncorrupted.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The only knowledge that s=\r\nhould (and can) be preserved without corruption is knowledge that is *absol=\r\nute*.

It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing impure or c=\r\norrupt about it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;At the end of the day, the key is whether one is ac=\r\ntually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or not, whether it is causing =\r\ninternal transformation in one or not, and whether it helps in one&#39;s\n spiri=\r\ntual progress or not.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let me cut &amp; paste a section =\r\nfrom a writeup I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an analogy giv=\r\nen earlier and addresses some relevant issues.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------=\r\n- --------&lt;BR&gt;Do Vedas Describe External Rituals&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Some people believe=\r\n that Veda describes the specifics about various external yagyas. Veda is s=\r\nupposed to be absolute, timeless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound =\r\nby desa-kaala-paatra. How can descriptions of specific external rituals be =\r\nunbound by desa-kaala-paatra?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Though Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrat=\r\ned commentary on RigVeda is ritualistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a di=\r\nfferent take in his =E2=80=9CSecret of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that =\r\nVeda talks about absolute truths about the inner self and not relative trut=\r\nhs about external matters. Agni or Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That is=\r\n why it is the immortal in mortals. Its rhythm will devour everything that =\r\nis\n perishable and purify all. While fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the d=\r\nivine Will, various offerings in it symbolize various aspects of one=E2=80=\r\n=99s conditioning and the smoke symbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and desir=\r\nes.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Metaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagamic Homam&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Notions that so an=\r\nd so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so and so aagamic/tantric yagya=\r\n ritual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in perspective using a metapho=\r\nr.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Once there were many people who lived near the sea [Aatman]. They=\r\n regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [absor=\r\nbed in Aatman most of the time]. They described the sea in some nice crypti=\r\nc poems [Veda].&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As people started living a little away from the sea =\r\n[less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together some instructions o=\r\nn how to reach the sea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the instru=\r\nctions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instructions\n [ritual=\r\ns].&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;People started moving further and further inland and started liv=\r\ning in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation had never=\r\n seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully perform=\r\ned the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They debated e=\r\nndlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and f=\r\normed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, foun=\r\nd a tree or a building or some interesting object and even became satisfied=\r\n that that was sea!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Then came some great person, whose instincts led=\r\n him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance [us=\r\ne of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put together =\r\nnewer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new =C3=\r\n=A4gama and tantra].&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;People performing the old rituals objected to t=\r\nhis and said &quot;but then this horse thing is not granted by the\n book of sea.=\r\n This is a new path and different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [pure Vedic r=\r\nitual]. By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems of th=\r\ne original &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed that those poems ta=\r\nught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfull=\r\ny unaware that the original instructions were meant for someone already clo=\r\nse to sea and the newer instructions came from someone who actually saw the=\r\n sea and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from the=\r\nre!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Slowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots =\r\netc were taught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead of just=\r\n instructing people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantr=\r\nas].&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One particular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and o=\r\nther dark tantric paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though =\r\nthe distance to sea was much shorter through that\n jungle, it was just too =\r\ndangerous and only the bravest and strongest could make it. There were crue=\r\nl dacoits and wild animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many we=\r\nak people travelling to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew =\r\nthe entire territory well came forward, condemned that path and discouraged=\r\n people from trying that path. Since then, even people who were strong enou=\r\ngh to successfully make it in that path desisted from it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As time pr=\r\nogressed, people started fighting too much about whose path was superior. T=\r\nhey were foolish, not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of e=\r\nither the so-called &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-called &quot;new&quot; path or other va=\r\nriations, for the changed geography and changed times. Many followed the in=\r\nstructions blindly, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even=\r\n know that &quot;reaching the sea&quot; was the actual goal of all their joirneys. Th=\r\ney only thought they were supposed to\n follow the instructions faithfully a=\r\nnd there was no need to adopt to the changed geographical territory and tim=\r\ne. They even condemned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave u=\r\npdated directions for their place and time, for violating tradition.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;In case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief summary of its points. V=\r\neda is about realizing self. Vedic deities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varu=\r\nna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are slightly different aspects of Aatman. Veda d=\r\nescribes various aspects of the state of self-realization. That is why it i=\r\ns considered the highest knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light =\r\non possible ways to reach that state. While definitive and absolute stateme=\r\nnts can be made on the actual state of self-realization itself, no definiti=\r\nve statements can be made on how to reach it. Only relative statements can =\r\nbe made based on desa-kaala-paatra. The path depends on one&#39;s current posit=\r\nion!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Great men in many\n spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as =\r\noutside of it, came, experienced that state, understood the current state o=\r\nf people around them and gave specific instructions on how to reach that st=\r\nate from the current state. Some followed the instructions and experienced =\r\nthe state.
