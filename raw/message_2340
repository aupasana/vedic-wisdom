You&#39;ve raised something that has\nmade me stop to think many times. It seems to me that Swami Vivekananda\nmade many statements - especially about Hinduism and India - that could\nbe construed to be disparaging of other religions and cultures, and that\nto me at least seemed a little unwarranted.\n\nWhether this can be put down simply to naivete, or whether it served\nsome purpose which we do not see, and is now taken out of context, I\ndon&#39;t know. In either case I have yet to reconcile those statements with\nthe rest of his teachings.\n\nKind regards,\n\nSamir\n\n\n\nOn 25/08/2009 11:46, rajarshi nandy wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste\n&gt;  \n&gt; /To any man who knows anything about Indian history, that very statement\n&gt; proves that the whole thing was a fraud, because the temple of Jagannath\n&gt; is an old Buddhistic temple. We took this and others over and\n&gt; re-Hinduised them. /\n&gt; // \n&gt; With all due respect to the great man that Swamiji was, he was possibly\n&gt; not aware what kind of effects an ill-researched statement may have in\n&gt; future.\n&gt;  \n&gt; That statement above is very controvertial and possibly incorrect. But\n&gt; the fact that it comes from Vivekananda, often people may consider it to\n&gt; be sacroscant and land up with wrong conclusions. Without a doubt,\n&gt; Swamiji was a spiritual Giant, but he was not a historian. He naively\n&gt; accepted most of the ideas about Indian history as propagated by western\n&gt; scholars.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Therefore, my advise, read lots and form your /own /opinions. When it\n&gt; comes to aspects of /materialistic/ knowledge, NOTHING and NO ONE is\n&gt; beyond questioning.\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n\n"}}
