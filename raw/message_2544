I found the analogies very enlightening and I have reflected a lot =\r\nupon your wise words of encouragement and I shall stop dilly-dallying asap.=\r\n \n\nAap sab ko koti koti dhanyawad.\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Na=\r\nrasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Let me address the conc=\r\nerns about Kundalini.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (1) Do not associate Kundalini in your mind wit=\r\nh any particular sadhana. Kundalini is awakened and rises if one is making =\r\npogress towards self-realization, no matter what path one follows and what =\r\nsadhana one does. Whether one chants Chandipath or mahamantra or Vishnu sah=\r\nasra naama or Gayatri or Ganapathi atharva seersha or an Islamic holy chant=\r\n or a Christian holy chant or does no mantra but just engages in selfless s=\r\nervice, does not matter. \n&gt;  \n&gt; (2) Kundalini is the force of self-awarenes=\r\ns. As one&#39;s false ideas of &quot;I am this&quot; get destroyed and one&#39;s self-awarene=\r\nss becomes refined, it translates to Kundalini awakening and rise.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (3=\r\n) Certain practices (e.g. some tantras and some praanaayaamas) are normally=\r\n associated with Kundalini. However, I can declare one thing very confident=\r\nly. Most people engaged in those practices actually have no clue. As long a=\r\ns one has a firm notion &quot;I am this body. There is a Kundalini in this body.=\r\n It will rise from point X in this body to point Y in this body now&quot;, one&#39;s=\r\n self-awareness is firmly stuck to the body and one&#39;s Kundalini is sure to =\r\nbe fast asleep in Mooladhara. Kundalini spontaneously rises when one&#39;s body=\r\n awareness goes. Consciously thinking of Kundalini rise is not required. As=\r\n a matter of fact, it becomes a blockage and makes one cling on to body awa=\r\nreness. In other words, pre-occupation with Kundalini rise blocks Kundalini=\r\n rise. Forget about Kundalini, forget about chakras, forget even about body=\r\n. Focus on the mantra and deity and imagine that they alone exist and fill =\r\nthe entire universe.\n&gt;  \n&gt; (4) Kundalini awakening is not something to be f=\r\neared. Forget all that you may have read. Sat-chid-aananda described in scr=\r\niptures is obtained when Kundalini is at sahasrara. Even low level aananda =\r\n(bliss) that is experienced as Kundalini merely rises is far higher than an=\r\ny physical or mental pleasures one may have experienced when one&#39;s self-awa=\r\nreness is firmly rooted in one&#39;s body.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A prince once got a wrong idea=\r\n that his father wanted to kill him. He ran away and hid in a dirty cave. W=\r\nhen sunlight came into the cave, he was happy. When  the cave became dark, =\r\nhe was scared. He lived like that in the cave, happy sometimes and sad at o=\r\nthers. He became so attached to the cave that he decided never to leave it.=\r\n Also, he was afraid to get out of the cave lest he be killed. But his peop=\r\nle were looking for him outside, because his father wanted to find his son =\r\nand coronate him as the king. But, the prince rotted in the cave unaware of=\r\n this and afraid of going out.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A person&#39;s attachment to body and fear=\r\n of self-realization is just like the above. Body is like the dirty cave. S=\r\nelf-realization is like getting out of the cave and becoming king.\n&gt;  \n&gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Will one incur the Brahma&#39;s curse for reciting th=\r\ne Paath with\n&gt; &gt; these motives in mind?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Chanting a mantra without bei=\r\nng tempted by any desires ever is the best. But, chanting a mantra and fall=\r\ning to some desires now and then is still better than not doing any sadhana=\r\n. It is not like your desires will leave you automatically if you do not do=\r\n any sadhana. As sadhana progresses, one *slowly* overcomes weaknesses and =\r\ndesires. The debit from any offenses committed in sadhana due to the few de=\r\nsires left are smaller than the credit from doing the sadhana.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One ma=\r\ny be putting salary money in the bank every month, but some of it may be be=\r\ning deduced for paying bills (mortgage, phone, cable, groceries etc). Still=\r\n, going to work everyday and putting the salary money in the bank account i=\r\ns better than not working.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; However, the call to praise the Mother i=\r\ns stronger and I am\n&gt; &gt; prepared to disregard the superstitions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ther=\r\ne are many misconceptions about every spiritual matter in today&#39;s world. Af=\r\nter all, this is Kali yuga and we have been through a particularly a dark p=\r\nhase. Just as undigested food becomes toxic, undigested and unassimilated k=\r\nnowledge leads to corruptions and superstitions.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you hear a call f=\r\nrom inside, do respond to it fearlessly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; =\r\n------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a S=\r\nhort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpan=\r\nas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ve=\r\ndicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagann=\r\nath.org\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- waspieswaspies &lt;waspieswaspies@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namaste all, \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I thought that there was no better place to ask this question sinc=\r\ne this is the yahoo group which has inspired me to consider doing the Chand=\r\ni Homam along with Shri Narasimhaji&#39;s words. My desire to praise the Divine=\r\n Mother in this way, keeps increasing everyday especially now that we are c=\r\noming close to the auspicious Navratri festival. I am plannig to start with=\r\n the recitation first so that I am up to scratch when I start doing the hom=\r\nam. (Learning to walk before learning to run) :)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I don&#39;t know if y=\r\nou had such dilemmas before you began doing Homams regularly. Please kindly=\r\n share how you have managed? My dilemmas are two-fold. Firstly, I encounter=\r\n objections from outside from fellow friends and family members who say tha=\r\nt &quot;the Chandi homam isn&#39;t part of the family tradition&quot; hence the family de=\r\nvta won&#39;t be pleased or &quot;un-initiated people cannot perform such a high lev=\r\nel ritual&quot; or even &quot;un-married people cannot get married if they do this on=\r\n a regularly basis&quot;! However, the call to praise the Mother is stronger and=\r\n I am prepared to disregard the superstitions.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What I find harde=\r\nr to discard though, are personal objections that I create for myself..I ca=\r\nll it the &quot;I-am-not-worthy-enough&quot; syndrome. I am not confident of being ab=\r\nle to stay completely detached during the homam. I think what I am trying t=\r\no say is that I do not know to what extent my underlying motives can remain=\r\n pure (unselfish) enough. At some point or another won&#39;t one end up automat=\r\nically asking for one&#39;s personal gains? After all, isn&#39;t it human nature to=\r\n confide everything/ask the Mother for everything..Maa mujhe new car chaahi=\r\nye, please give my kids good health/good grades etc? Will one incur the Bra=\r\nhma&#39;s curse for reciting the Paath with these motives in mind? In that case=\r\n, is the Brahmadi Sapa Vimochan mantra enough to &#39;white-wash&#39; one&#39;s selfish=\r\n motives?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Secondly, I have to admit that after listening to some t=\r\nales about regular recitation of the Chandi Paath being associated with &#39;Ku=\r\nndalini jagran&#39;, I am a bit worried. Can sadhana and &#39;kundalini jagran&#39; eve=\r\nr be mutually exclusive? What if one wants to pray for the sake of praying =\r\nonly? Do they still have to undergo chakra awakening etc? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Thank u=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; Somanathan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
