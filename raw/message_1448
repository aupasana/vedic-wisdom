Reading Vishnu&#39;s 1000 \nnames can NEVER harm you. NEVER. It may increase good results or decrease \nbad results, but never increase bad results.\n\nSecondly, the symptoms you are describing sound a lot like some movement of \npraana (life force) in some of the upper chakras. This is not a bad thing at \nall. If some other pieces of the puzzle fall in place, this can actually \nhelp your spiritual progress considerably.\n\nInstead of telling you to stop Vishnu sahasranaam, I will suggest increasing \nthe number of times you read it. If you spend an hour in the morning and an \nhour in the evening, it will be awesome.\n\nIn fact, if it is possible, doing a homam every morning with Vishnu \nsahasranaam will accelerate the progress. I will have to soon put together a \nVishnu sahasra naama homam.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;harikishan1962&quot; &lt;harikishan1962@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Thursday, March 05, 2009 11:52 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Is reading Vishnushaharanamas Thries a day will \nReduce our Past Life Karma?\n\n\n&gt; Namaskaram GuRU NARASIMHA GARU,\n&gt;           I had a Health Problem which doctors do not identify. While \n&gt; watching TV i hard that Sri VishnuSahsranams will reduce the Past Life \n&gt; Karma along  with Present Life Problems. From past 10 Years i am reading \n&gt; Sri VishnuSahsranamas regularly. Three Years ago i noticed some kind of \n&gt; pinning on Centre of my Head, i asked  so many people about this. every \n&gt; body says their own opinion, i continued Reading Sahasranamas just \n&gt; depending on VISHNU, Now i have simulations in between EYEBROWS and on the \n&gt; TOP OF NOSE, when i went in to prayer there are lot of movements in my \n&gt; Head like a ANT or some small FLY  moving above the ear to forehead from \n&gt; both sides AND THE PINNING IS THROUHG OUT DAY and  now a days i am hearing \n&gt; non stop sound like &quot;wueeeeeeeeee&quot;, in my ears.Few days ago i asked Master \n&gt; CVV disciple about this, he said that &quot;Stop Reading Sahasranamas, but my \n&gt; will is not accept.                                                  Can \n&gt; you tell me what happening to me, or any OTHER REMEDY for me Sir.\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaskaram\n&gt; Bhavadhiyudu,\n&gt; Hari Kishan\n\n\n"}}
