If you are sincere, you&#39;ll be helped. although, i \nwri=\r\nte\n&gt; &gt; much now a days, i am just like anybody else, struggeling !!!\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\n am a beggar like others. But I try to help other beggars by \nshowing the \n=\r\n&gt; houses where they can try their luck by begging.\n&gt; \n&gt; Normally, one begga=\r\nr may view another beggar as a competitor and \nnot like \n&gt; too many people =\r\nto beg in the same area. However, this begging is \ndifferent \n&gt; and there i=\r\ns no competition between different beggars. The owner of \nthe \n&gt; house has =\r\nenough to give to every beggar and does not mind giving \nto many \n&gt; beggars=\r\n at the same time if they are worthy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actually, if one beggar gets som=\r\nething, it will be so much that \nhe/she can \n&gt; share some of it with all ar=\r\nound him/her. If you go with 100 other \nbeggars \n&gt; and beg, you are better =\r\noff. If any one of them is able to melt the \nheart of \n&gt; the owner of the h=\r\nouse, all the hundred will benefit from it to \nvarying \n&gt; degrees!\n&gt; \n&gt; Whe=\r\nn I tell people about external practices such as homam and \ninternal \n&gt; pra=\r\nctices such as surrender and detachment in actions, all I am \nreally doing =\r\n\n&gt; is to take fellow beggars in front of a house where a rich person \nlives=\r\n. If \n&gt; they are able to melt the heart of the owner of the house, their \nb=\r\negging \n&gt; will be fruitful. That is completely in *their* hands.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am =\r\nonly a beggar who can show a place where other beggars can beg \nand I am \n&gt;=\r\n not really &quot;capable&quot; of anything more. Please do not treat me in \nany othe=\r\nr \n&gt; way.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Swami Brahmananda, the spiritual son of Ramakrishna \nPa=\r\nramahamsa, and \n&gt; Thakur himself saw themselves as beggars in front of the =\r\nMother, \nmama kim \n&gt; kathaa (what is my story).\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; In general, to those who are struggling with internal conflicts \nrelated=\r\n to \n&gt; spiritual progress and getting frustrated, I have a few words. Rome =\r\n\nis not \n&gt; built in a day. Forget Rome, even a small protocol of Rome is no=\r\nt \nbuilt in a \n&gt; day! Be patient.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have seen people change from insid=\r\ne out in a short span of time. \nThere is \n&gt; no need to panic or give up hop=\r\ne.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Be patient. Read scriptures. Read the word=\r\ns of saints and yogis \nsuch as \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Ramana Maharshi,=\r\n Chaitanya Mahaprabhu, \n&gt; Sankaracharya, Ramanujacharya, Madhvacharya, Sai =\r\nBaba, Kabir, Jesus \nChrist, \n&gt; Buddha, Mahavira, Jnaneshwar etc. Try to und=\r\nerstand what they are \nsaying. \n&gt; Try to integrate some of it into your com=\r\nmon sense, your way of \nthinking and \n&gt; your life style. Realize that the g=\r\noal of spiritual practices is \ninner \n&gt; transformation. The archives of thi=\r\ns yahoogroup also have some \ninspired \n&gt; writings.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nobody can change y=\r\nou. You yourself can do it. You CAN do it, if \nyou really \n&gt; want to. Intro=\r\nspect and go to the root of your problems. If you \nintrospect \n&gt; and analyz=\r\ne each big problem, you will realize that ego is the root \nof it \n&gt; all. Wh=\r\nenever something in life seems fundamentally important, \nquestion why. \n&gt; I=\r\n am not saying to leave it. Do what you normally do. But, atleast \nanalyze =\r\n\n&gt; why it is important and try to understand your inner motives. Scuh \n&gt; in=\r\ntrospection will eventually lighten the clouds of fear, \nexpectation, \n&gt; at=\r\ntachment and pride that often color one&#39;s attitude.\n&gt; \n&gt; Introspect on your=\r\n attitude and motives and contemplate on the \nnature of \n&gt; god. Meditate.\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; In this age, there is nothing like a total surrender to the Lord. \nOf c=\r\nourse, \n&gt; saying &quot;I surrender to you. So give me x or y&quot; is NOT total \nsurr=\r\nender. Total \n&gt; surrender means you take whatever the Lord gives without qu=\r\nestions \nand \n&gt; expectations. If you can manage it, you are all set!\n&gt; \n&gt; *=\r\n        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Homam or worship of deities in fire is a powerful p=\r\nractice taught \nby rishis. \n&gt; I know from experience that it burns blocking=\r\n karmas and enables \nthe inner \n&gt; transformation. It is a very useful spiri=\r\ntual practice. I know \npeople who \n&gt; made (and are making) considerable spi=\r\nritual progress through \nregular \n&gt; practice of homam. It is the most power=\r\nful method I know of and \nteaching it \n&gt; is one of my tasks for this life.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Rajesh, try to make some time in your daily schedule and start \nd=\r\noing \n&gt; Mahaganapathi homam everyday. After a few months, you should switch=\r\n \nto \n&gt; Vishnu sahasra naama homam (I will put it up on my website by \nthen=\r\n). THAT \n&gt; should help you find your way in your spiritual life and strike =\r\nthe \nright \n&gt; balance between spiritual life and material life.\n&gt; \n&gt; The pu=\r\nrpose of material life on this earth is to perform actions to \npay back \n&gt; =\r\ndebts without incurring new debts, so that spiritual progress \nbecomes \n&gt; s=\r\nmoother. Without paying certain debts, spiritual life cannot \nbecome smooth=\r\n. \n&gt; However, without some spiritual progress, actions in material life \ncr=\r\neate \n&gt; new debts. In the beginning, one needs to create a synergy between =\r\n\nthe two \n&gt; and use the actions in material life to promote spiritual life.=\r\n For \ntrue \n&gt; spiritual progress, most people cannot and should not run awa=\r\ny from \nmaterial \n&gt; life.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vasishtha said in the very beginning of Yoga=\r\n Vaasishtham that \naction and \n&gt; knowledge are two wings with which the bir=\r\nd of manifested Self \nflies and \n&gt; becomes liberated. Action without correc=\r\nt knowledge creates pride, \npromote \n&gt; ego and binds one further instead of=\r\n liberating. Knowledge without \naction \n&gt; does not become complete because =\r\nof the remaining debts and one is \nstuck. \n&gt; One needs to have true knowled=\r\nge and perform actions, to become \nfree.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Sh=\r\nort Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpana=\r\ns Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://ved=\r\nicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJaganna=\r\nth.org\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@.=\r\n..&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, December 18, 200=\r\n8 3:29 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear=\r\n Raju,\n&gt; \n&gt; Have patience !

Z finds that the same Desire has Risen again, he again\n&gt; s=\r\natsfies\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the same with the same action. these cycle keeps going on & o=\r\nn\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; many years. Mr. Z feels like most in the world that this desi=\r\nre\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have sexual relationship is &#39;Natural&#39;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Now let&#39;s =\r\nanalysie the above case. Though mr.Z satsfies the want\n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; copulatio=\r\nn, it comes back again & again. it means that the\n&gt; desire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; has never =\r\nbeen satsfied even by giving it FOOD Again & again.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Our spi=\r\nritual giants equvivocally say that The Energy which is\n&gt; lost\n&gt; &gt; &gt; during=\r\n copulation is the BEST Energy available in a person which\n&gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; restr=\r\nained, controlled and preserved, can easly become OJAS and\n&gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; help=\r\n immensly in the path of Spiritual journey.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; consider that o=\r\nur Mr. Z some how got to read the above paragraph\n&gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; started ser=\r\niously thinking about it. He tells himself that he\n&gt; would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; refrain fr=\r\nom intercourse for 3 months. The earlier frequency was\n&gt; &gt; 2/3\n&gt; &gt; &gt; days, =\r\nnow he suddenly finds that desire has completely overtaken\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him. after=\r\n 15 days, he finds that Desire has gone in to his\n&gt; every\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pour and ev=\r\nery thought and he gives up and succumbs to that\n&gt; &gt; gigantic\n&gt; &gt; &gt; force o=\r\nf Kaam Vaasana. This may be called suppression initially\n&gt; &gt; &gt; which failed=\r\n the effort. The person again analyses what went\n&gt; wrong\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and again tr=\r\nies to do the same and again fails. he keeps on\n&gt; trying\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and keeps on=\r\n failing. during this battles, he is also exploring\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; gathering k=\r\nnowledge of experienced people and knowledge from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual books. he=\r\n understands that if he needs to win the\n&gt; Final\n&gt; &gt; &gt; WAR with this Very F=\r\normidable enemy, he needs to do lot of\n&gt; things\n&gt; &gt; &gt; simultaneously and he=\r\n then resorts to the help from many\n&gt; quarters.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; He starts taking cold=\r\n water bath, starts reading spiritual\n&gt; books,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; stops reading film mag=\r\nazine, stops watching Films and TV Shows,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Reduces eating Onion and ga=\r\nrlic, starts doing Yoga Aasan,\n&gt; &gt; Meditation\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and so on and so forth.=\r\n taking the aids thus he keeps on\n&gt; batteling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; with the *Natural Desir=\r\ne* and still keeps on loosing. but the\n&gt; good\n&gt; &gt; &gt; news is that his days o=\r\nf batteling before loosing has increased.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; started from 10 days, he ha=\r\ns now reached the struggeling\n&gt; capacity\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 90 days. (WE ARE ASSU=\r\nMING HERE THAT HIS WIFE IS FULLY\n&gt; COOPERATIVE\n&gt; &gt; OF\n&gt; &gt; &gt; HIS THEATRICS).=\r\n He is still unhappy about his loosing, although\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is able to keep=\r\n-up the Physical brahmacharya for 3 months. some\n&gt; how\n&gt; &gt; &gt; he realises th=\r\nat God&#39;s grace is the most important thing\n&gt; especially\n&gt; &gt; &gt; for this pert=\r\nicular matter and he now starts Praying to his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; favourite Deity every =\r\nday. he cries and cries and requests the\n&gt; God\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to save him from this =\r\nloss. he keeps on trying every thing\n&gt; &gt; possible,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; keeps on praying s=\r\nincerely and severly, keeps on doing various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual sadhanas but s=\r\ntill keeps on loosing at as well. over a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; period of some 8/10 years, t=\r\nhe desired change is visible. he has\n&gt; &gt; &gt; conquered his desire. Now Sexual=\r\n Desire which was his *Natural*\n&gt; for\n&gt; &gt; &gt; him has been replaced by Brahma=\r\ncharya.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &#39;Supression&#39; when combined with Thoughtful Suspension, =\r\nequipped\n&gt; &gt; with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; every possible preparation and will power to try un=\r\ntiringly\n&gt; again &\n&gt; &gt; &gt; again finally results in to annihilation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; ***\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2.

Lord rama w=\r\nas also married and had kids..still\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was called Maryada purushott=\r\nam...Lord Krishna has 8 patranis and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 16000 gopia.. well does it mean =\r\nthat Lord krishna had physical\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relationship with all of them.. or he =\r\nhad not? that is all\n&gt; together\n&gt; &gt; &gt; different issue..But lord krishna was=\r\n shringar priya=C2 and=C2 it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; seems that he had enjoyed physical realt=\r\nionship.. (???)=C2 still\n&gt; he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; was called brahmachari.. how? i am bit =\r\nconfused..\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I personally feel that to have sexual desire and=\r\n not\n&gt; fulfilling\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it,=C2 cannot be termed as brahmacharya.. it is lik=\r\ne cheating\n&gt; &gt; &gt; yourself.. and if you are married and if you donot fulfill=\r\n\n&gt; desire\n&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; your spouse is also not good.. Please advise.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rajesh\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;

Practice suppressing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; desires, but=\r\n do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; remember that the final goal is to uproot it fully =\r\nand\n&gt; keep\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; working on it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya\n&gt; is\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i =\r\ncan also\n&gt; do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; it ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 =\r\nyears at least in 10-12 years\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That =\r\nis the right spirit!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritual prog=\r\nress involves a lot of things and\n&gt; brahmacharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n one thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The most fundamental thing is to overcome e=\r\ngo and not\n&gt; become\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attached to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; thing=\r\ns. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions and\n&gt; &gt; possessions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; developing a sense of surrender is the most fund=\r\namental\n&gt; thing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several =\r\nthings in spiritual progress. They all\n&gt; come\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together! O=\r\nne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person may develop detachment to actions and possess=\r\nions\n&gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; brahmacharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; may become ea=\r\nsy as a result. One person may achieve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; brahmacharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n first and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; detachment may become easy as a result and c=\r\nome later.\n&gt; &gt; Various\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; signs of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiri=\r\ntual progress come almost together, but the exact\n&gt; order\n&gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; change from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person to person. Thus, do not b=\r\ne disappointed by your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inability\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; something.

&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that as mentioned in r=\r\necent thread on brahamcharya,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was important to maint=\r\nain brahamcharya but i wanted to\n&gt; ask\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; even vimalananda had to work for 6 years for overcoming\n&gt; lust\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; though\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he had his deity with him from the very=\r\n early in life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; how can normal coll=\r\nege going people like me who don&#39;t even\n&gt; &gt; &gt; have a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; de=\r\nity obtain this goal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though i try to maintain physical=\r\n brahamcharya for few\n&gt; months\n&gt; &gt; &gt; but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; after that i a=\r\nm not able to hold it ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and even if i maintain some phy=\r\nsical chastity it refuses\n&gt; to\n&gt; &gt; go\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; of mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in=\r\n AGHORA was the important thing is\n&gt; not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; suppress desir=\r\nes but remove them from the root\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So=\r\n, how can i finish it completely from my mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though i =\r\nhave read Swami Sivananda&#39;s book on Practice of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brahamcha=\r\nrya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but i don&#39;t think i have made any spiritual progres=\r\ns in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; maintaing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Brahamcharya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and sometimes it makes me guilt ridden.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamc=\r\nharya\n&gt; is if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time probasb=\r\nly i can also do\n&gt; &gt; it ,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 years at le=\r\nast in 10-12 years\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you can also rep=\r\nly on VEDIC WISDOM group but if you can\n&gt; &gt; remove\n&gt; &gt; &gt; my\n&gt;
