Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Sir,\n&gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; i will say if the person is spiritual ...go and do tapasya in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Him=\r\nalay..why sitting in pleasure world and earning money and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enjoying al=\r\nl world pleasures.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Sitting in pleasure world and earning money is NOT=\r\n synonymous \nto &quot;enjoying all world pleasures&quot;. One may be sitting in pleas=\r\nure \nworld, earning money and engaging externally in various activities, \nb=\r\nut the mind may be established in peace and bliss.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A realized person =\r\nis NOT identified by the actions he/she engages \nin. Just as an electric fa=\r\nn continues to turn for a few minutes even \nafter the electricity is turned=\r\n off, a realized person who is still \nin a body continues to engage in acti=\r\nons based on the previous flow. \nAfter King Janaka realized Self, he contin=\r\nued as the king of Mithila \nand did all royal duties. After Krishna made Ar=\r\njuna realize Self, \nArjuna fought a war and killed his gurus, brothers, gra=\r\nndfather etc.\n&gt;  \n&gt; One who has not yet realized Self will distinguish betw=\r\neen various \nobjects of this dual world and view some as good and some as b=\r\nad. \nHe/she will try to stay away from so-called bad actions. On the other =\r\n\nhand, a realized person sees all people, objects and actions of this \nuniv=\r\nerse as the same Self and sees no reason to either be attracted \nto or repe=\r\nlled from anything. His/her actions and inactions are thus \nnot based on th=\r\ne principles of attraction and repulsion. They are \nbased on the previous f=\r\nlow.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Renouncing wife, children, job, money etc is an attempt to find =\r\n\ntrue mental renunciation. Renouncing external objects can promote \nmental =\r\nrenunciation, but not guarantee it. On the other hand, one can \nremain in t=\r\nhe midst of the material world and all the external \nobjects and yet have a=\r\n perfectly stable, peaceful and blissful mind \nthat is not attracted to or =\r\nrepelled from any of the objects one is \nsurrounded by. For all you know, a=\r\n big film star like Rajinikanth, \nwho makes millions of dollars per movie, =\r\nsurrounded by glamour, money \nand adulation, may be more detached at the me=\r\nntal level than many \nyogis in Himalayas. It is probably true in the case o=\r\nf Rajinikanth.\n&gt;  \n&gt; When one stays away from objects that may attract one,=\r\n it is \nrelatively easy to overcome attraction temporarily. Whether one can=\r\n \nretain that renunciation when one comes in contact with the objects \nagai=\r\nn or not is a questionmark. On the other hand, to be in contact \nwith the o=\r\nbjects that may attract one and yet maintain mental \ndetachment and mental =\r\nrenunciation is tougher. It is the true test.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is not out of place =\r\nto mention a small story.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Trilinga Swami lived for about 300 years an=\r\nd did unbelievable \nausterities in Kashi. When Ramakrishna Paramahamsa met =\r\nhim in Kashi, \nhe remarked to his sishyas that Trilinga Swami was Shiva Him=\r\nself and \na fully realized being. Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was not =\r\nwith \nhim on that pilgrimage and he made a point to force Narendranath to \n=\r\ngo to Kashi later to have a darshan of Trilinga Swami!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Lahiri Mahasha=\r\nya was the guru of Yukteshwar Maharaj, who was the \nguru of Paramahamsa Yog=\r\nananda. Lahiri Mahashaya was a householder and \nhad a high-paying job. Yet =\r\nhe realized Self. Trilnga Swami spoke \nlittle, but he once spoke a few word=\r\ns in Lahiri Mahashaya&#39;s praise. \nHe said, &quot;The state of mind I achieved by =\r\nrenouncing everything, \nLahiri achieved it while being a householder, being=\r\n in the middle of \neverything. I bow to him.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; *         *         *\n&gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in my view, being a senior astrologer doesnt make one to \ncertify =\r\nany\n&gt; &gt; &gt; persons doings as good and spiritual.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Nobody can &quot;certify&quot; =\r\nanybody. However, those who know some \nastrology can give their views on ch=\r\narts that are shared and \ndiscussed publicly. If some people see those view=\r\ns as \na &quot;certificates&quot;, it is their perception.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *         *         *=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Self-realization can be consistently defined. However, spirituality =\r\n\nis tough to define. It will mean different things to different people.\n&gt;  =\r\n\n&gt; The goal of all spiritual journeys is to realize Self, at some time \nor =\r\nthe other. However, most spiritual journeys of this age do NOT end \nin Self=\r\n-realization.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is limited ego that binds one to a limited existence=\r\n like a body \nand stops one from realizing the all-pervading true Self. Whi=\r\nle a \nself-realized person&#39;s ego is completely killed, it is possible to \nm=\r\nake partial progress. There are many people, who overcome ego to \nvarious e=\r\nxtents and realize to various degrees that body is temporary \nand it is not=\r\n the true self. One can do so by following many \nspiritual paths, like the =\r\npath of knowledge, the path of devotion, \nthe path of pranayama, the path o=\r\nf hatha yoga, the path of work and \nservice etc. One who overcomes ego to s=\r\nome extent, using any path, is \nmaking some spiritual progress. When the eg=\r\no is completely subdued, \none realizes the true Self. This realization is t=\r\nhe same irrespective \nof the path followed. However, intermediate steps loo=\r\nk and feel \ndifferent based on the path.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Enough of my 2 cents for ton=\r\night...\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------\n&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www=\r\n.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ve=\r\ndic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net=\r\n\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Ja=\r\ngannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt;   Dear Prasha=\r\nnt ji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; in my view, being a senior astrologer doesnt make one to=\r\n \ncertify any\n&gt; &gt; &gt; persons doings as good and spiritual.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There=\r\n are many factors which one over looks,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and in true sense ....w=\r\nhat is the real spiritualism.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; i will say if the person is spiri=\r\ntual ...go and do tapasya in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Himalay..why sitting in pleasure world a=\r\nnd earning money and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; enjoying all world pleasures.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Regard=\r\ns,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Tarun\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
