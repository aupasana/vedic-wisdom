Nyasas are supposed to *place* the energy of certain sounds in \nspecific chakras (energy centers) of the body. Then digbandha is supposed to \nlock all directions so that no energy except that of the deity being \nworshipped can enter the area. You are placing an energy fence around you \nthat can be crossed only by a specific energy.\n\nHowever, these procedures are a mere formality now-a-days and very few can \nactually do them as they are supposed to be done. Any person or energy can \n*penetrate* the area that has been locked out in the digbandha done by most \npeople. It is ineffectual. However, the good thing with keeping the \ntradition alive is that knowledge is passed on and a capable person coming \nin a future generation can benefit from the knowledge passed on blindly and \nwithout experiential verification.\n\nI stress surrender, devotion and sincerity and downplay various technical \naspects to which most people - including many professional priests - cannot \ndo justice anyway.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;aparajita_vidya&quot; &lt;aparajita_vidya@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, November 18, 2008 6:34 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Digbandha\n\n\n&gt; Respected Guruji\n&gt;\n&gt; What is digbandha and how is it related to homa or any puja?\n&gt;\n&gt; -Best Wishes\n&gt; Aparajita\n\n\n"}}
