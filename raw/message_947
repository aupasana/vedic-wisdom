It \n&gt; all boils down to\n&gt; &gt; the amount of fire that is pr=\r\nesent in the homa kunda. If \n&gt; there is good\n&gt; &gt; amount of fire, even if yo=\r\nu do not offer ghee, offering \n&gt; marmara , havan\n&gt; &gt; samagri etc will be ea=\r\nsily consumed. But if the fire is \n&gt; small, then you\n&gt; &gt; do need to offer g=\r\nhee drops to keep the fire alive.\n&gt; &gt; There were days when I used about 8-1=\r\n0 coconut halves for \n&gt; 1\n&gt; &gt; chandi homam, ie started with 2 pieces of 1 c=\r\noconut half, \n&gt; adding half\n&gt; &gt; piece of coconut half for each chapter and =\r\nfinally a \n&gt; piece for\n&gt; &gt; purnahuti. Now, I am able to manage 1 chandi hom=\r\na with \n&gt; about 2-3 coconut\n&gt; &gt; halves. Others out there might be able to d=\r\no with much \n&gt; less. It also\n&gt; &gt; depends on the coconut pieces itself, some=\r\n pieces burn \n&gt; slow and some\n&gt; &gt; fast, so the quantity you may need may va=\r\nry.\n&gt; &gt; Most importantly I suggest you follow an important advice \n&gt; of\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Narasimhaji. Pouring ghee drops around the corners of the \n&gt; coconut piece=\r\n,\n&gt; &gt; making sure the piece catches fire from all the corners. \n&gt; Doing thi=\r\ns way,\n&gt; &gt; at the end of the homa, all the coconut pieces are \n&gt; completely=\r\n burnt,\n&gt; &gt; almost like powder.\n&gt; &gt; So, my suggestion to you is to have ple=\r\nnty of offerings \n&gt; at your\n&gt; &gt; disposal, try to keep the fire going ( big =\r\nor small does \n&gt; not matter). \n&gt; &gt; Make sure the offerings that you put wit=\r\nh each swaha \n&gt; (sloka) catch fire.\n&gt; &gt; Hold your offerings ie havan samagr=\r\ni, marmara, poha etc \n&gt; joining your\n&gt; &gt; ring finger, middle finger and thu=\r\nmb. This way, you will \n&gt; be offering\n&gt; &gt; decent amount with each swaha.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Like Narasimhaji, I prepare a mixture of havan samagri, \n&gt; black and\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nwhite sesame seeds, marmara,poha etc in a container and \n&gt; used the\n&gt; &gt; com=\r\nbination as offering.\n&gt; &gt; I am sure within first few days of your homa, you=\r\n will \n&gt; have very\n&gt; &gt; good idea of how much ghee and other offerings you n=\r\need \n&gt; to make.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; All the Best.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ravi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-=\r\nwisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;khosladheeraj@ ...&gt; wrote:\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;DHEERAJ KHOSLA&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; k=\r\nhosladheeraj@ wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskar Narsimhaji and others,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I want to do homam for chandi devi.I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; had arranged a coppe=\r\nr tray in square shape.Almost 1 \n&gt; feet by 1\n&gt; &gt; &gt; feet.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So is it g=\r\nood measurement or not ?
