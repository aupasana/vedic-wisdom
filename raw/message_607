This is an unbelievable experience that I have had. I have=\r\n not added anything from my own. I am writing exactly as was happened in my=\r\n life. I am going back to the period of 1973/74. Kindly read this only when=\r\n you are in religious mood.\n=C2=A0\nI was working as telegraphist at Okha Po=\r\nrt Post office near Dwarka. My duty was from 7 am to 7 pm and I was getting=\r\n late fee allowance for extra duty. There was a Telephone exchange just opp=\r\nosite to Post office and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; I had friendship with s=\r\nome Telephone operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (we will call him as Mr. =\r\nPatel) was working as Operator. He was a staunch devotee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 shri Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he was always talking ab=\r\nout shri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was a weekly gathering at =\r\nhis home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional songs created by him an=\r\nd was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishna Kathamrita. We 10 to=\r\n 12 youngsters were attending this weekly meeting on Saturday evening. I wa=\r\ns then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30 then. We were used to go to seasho=\r\nre daily at 7 pm after duty hours and were talking only about Thakur.\nOne d=\r\nay when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai, some =\r\nguest have come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My son will come =\r\nin a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. -- And with m=\r\ny surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. \nAt one another incident h=\r\ne told me that there will be a plane crash tomorrow and that also happened.=\r\n I was very much impressed about him. He could foresee the events. One day =\r\nI had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he told me not to go through bus, as bus tire=\r\n will be punctured. Yet I went to Bus station but bus did not come from Dwa=\r\nrka as was punctured on the way. This was surprising.\nThis all incidents ma=\r\nde me to believe that he had some super power and this was due to Ramkrisha=\r\nndev worship only. I was attracted to shri Thakur. One day I thought, I sho=\r\nuld also be disciple of shri Thakur and the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7=\r\n pm I surrendered myself to Thakur at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thak=\r\nur picture. I prayed him deeply from my heart to accept me as his follower =\r\nand bestow his grace. \nNext day morning I had a discussion with my wife at =\r\n6.10 morning while taking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was =\r\nwaking up at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have acc=\r\nepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife was annoyed and she argued =\r\nwith me a lot. =E2=80=94=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision?=\r\n Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a grea=\r\nt Saint but our Guru should be living one, who can guide us, give us Mantra=\r\n etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya since you are =\r\ndoing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.\nHer arguments were right at her place as p=\r\neople in general not know much about Thakur and I was confused. I thought--=\r\n yes I have taken hasty decision. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\nB=\r\nut I remember that Mr. Patel had told me that Thakur was telling their disc=\r\niples to test him before accepting him. I also decided to test Thakur. I im=\r\nmediately told my wife that =E2=80=93=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has never come=\r\n to our home. You have also not seen him. He has never asked me where I am =\r\nliving. Suppose Mr. Patel is coming to our house within 10 to 15 minutes, w=\r\nould you believe that my selection for Thakur is perfect?=E2=80=9D--\nShe la=\r\nughed at me=E2=80=94=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=\r\n=E2=80=9D--\nI prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify m=\r\ny decision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence eve=\r\nn today.=E2=80=99\nTo our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 =\r\nin the morning with angry mood. What he told?\n=E2=80=98 How dare you test T=\r\nhakur this way? Do you know what happened? Yesterday was my night duty and =\r\nI had just come to my home at 05.30 mornings today and tried to sleep for 1=\r\n or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur pulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C G=\r\no to your friend=E2=80=99s house. He is waiting for you. He wants to test m=\r\ne. I will show you his house=E2=80=9D\nI immediately rushed to your home. Th=\r\nakur was guiding me the way to your house and pushing me too. What you want=\r\n? Why you are disturbing him in such an early morning for such a silly thin=\r\ngs?=E2=80=99\nWe both were so excited and surprised that we had no words tha=\r\nt Morning. \nI will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in my life. T=\r\nhere were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I will write i=\r\nt sometime.\nDear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishandev is still alive on th=\r\ne earth. This is a fact I have written and no word is added to exaggerate.=\r\n=C2=A0 May Shri Thakur bless all of us.\nDr. Ashwin Rawal Ahmedabad\n\n\n\n\n    =\r\n  Add more friends to your messenger and enjoy!
