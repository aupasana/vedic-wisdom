However, I=\r\n agree with you. I see no point in the cut-paste posts. It would be more he=\r\nlpful if one adds one&#39;s opinion which could blossom into a positive discuss=\r\nion and a learning opportunity. After all, they might as well provide the w=\r\neb url or the book name and we could always buy it or read it online. If pe=\r\nople take the contents directly from the web and paste it here, then I woul=\r\nd strongly discourage this kind of posts. However, if they have painstaking=\r\nly typed up the matter from books, then I don&#39;t have the heart to ask them =\r\nto stop it.\n\nI usually skip these posts and others where the fonts are enla=\r\nrged and bold to such a point that it makes it difficult to read and irrita=\r\nting. People should realize, in the internet/email medium, using upper-case=\r\n, bold. italics have a different meaning especially if one wants to strongl=\r\ny emphasize a point. What&#39;s the point of writing the entire article in the =\r\nsame manner??\n\nAnyways, I don&#39;t want to write more on this topic and consum=\r\ne members bandwidth.\n\nThanks & Regards\nNarayan\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, &quot;vvootla&quot; &lt;vvootla@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; ||| aum namO bhagavathE vAsud=\r\nEvAya |||\n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Members,\n&gt;      I&#39;m not sure what everyone&#39;s opinion is=\r\n about the recent &#39;daily cut and paste from web&#39; kind of posts appearing on=\r\n this forum, but I think this has to be discouraged. Otherwise, each member=\r\n may soon start posting verbatim from their favorite books or websites or g=\r\nurus or philosophies and with such &#39;daily spam&#39; there would not be many pos=\r\nts meant for reading/discussion. It is one thing to quote a relevant passag=\r\ne from a book or url or Master on a currently running topic and another to =\r\npost along the recent patterns. One can always start a discussion sharing a=\r\n piece of writing or speech by any Master/Book and open it to the forum for=\r\n discussing issues, problems or clarifications by raising them explicitly a=\r\nlong with the relevant material. If other members share my feeling on this =\r\nthen we can request the moderator to act accordingly. \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; -Prasad=\r\n\n&gt; PS: I was thinking of turning some of my group subscriptions to direct e=\r\nmail mode and evaluating the volume in each of those groups in recent past =\r\nand I hit upon this in the process.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
