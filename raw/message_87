The \npath of exclusion keeps on eliminating everything in this manifested world \nappearance as &quot;this is not Self&quot;, in order to realize what IS Self. After \neliminating everything, what is left is the Self/Brahman. This path \npredominantly exercises Pingala/Surya nadi (solar channel of energy flow).\n\nThe path of inclusion considers everything as Self. Even the limited \nmanifestations of Brahman are considered as Self only and accepted thus. One \nsees Self in all that is manifested. This path predominantly exercises \nIda/Chandra nadi (lunar channel of energy flow).\n\nIn both the paths, one overcomes the simple and finite concept of I-ness \nwith something more infinite.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------------------------------\nHomam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;shrivajra&quot; &lt;shrivajra@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;sivacharya@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, July 06, 2007 12:24 PM\nSubject: [sivacharya] Re: On Adwaitism, Shiva&#39;s Worship and Different Paths\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; Many thanks for a beautiful and uplifting post. You wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; We are now in Kali Yuga and it is inevitable that biases,\n&gt; narrow-mindedness and posturing enter the mindsets of\n&gt; many learned&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; One thing that always inspired me was what I learned of the\n&gt; great monastery of Nalanda. A centre of learning and practice\n&gt; for both Hindus and Buddhists. Also in many suttas we witness\n&gt; debates between wandering holy men and the Buddha. Debates\n&gt; marked with humility, respect and a true thirst for knowledge.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have always felt a deep affection for the Hindu traditions as I\n&gt; understand how very close we are when it comes to the final\n&gt; steps. Like siblings in an empty world we really only have each\n&gt; other. Which other theist position can match the sublime\n&gt; qualities that are the pinnacle of your faith?\n&gt;\n&gt; I truly regret that I will never be a part of such blissful company\n&gt; as was known then.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; However, if one gets too involved in building tall structures on earth, \n&gt; one\n&gt; may find it interesting and keep on building taller and taller structures\n&gt; and forget the ultimate goal of finally reaching the sky&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; This is very true. An eagle relies on its wings to soar effortlessly\n&gt; in the sky but once there the creature has no need to think about\n&gt; them. It is as if they `vanish&#39;.\n&gt;\n&gt; &quot; There is no fool-proof approach to have an Adwaitic self-realization. \n&gt; Even\n&gt; as one engages in various practices, one should keep the final goal at the\n&gt; back of mind&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Please permit me to freewheel and offer some foolish remarks. We could\n&gt; say that there are two ways of labelling self-realization, I&#39;ll call them \n&gt; the\n&gt; `positive&#39; and the `negative&#39; for want of better words and lack of \n&gt; imagination.\n&gt;\n&gt; With the `positive&#39; we are one with the All, like a raindrop in the ocean. \n&gt; Not\n&gt; only can we not find any distinction between the drop and the water around \n&gt; it,\n&gt; it is the limitless ocean itself.\n&gt;\n&gt; With the `negative&#39;, All is `not-self&#39;. There is nothing of `us&#39; to find\n&gt; anywhere,\n&gt; no line can be drawn in the sand, no quarter given, release - like a cloud\n&gt; vanished into an empty sky.\n&gt;\n&gt; We may be standing at opposite sides of a circle but, in truth, this \n&gt; circle\n&gt; only has one side and one epicentre.\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste\n&gt; Kris\n&gt;\n&gt; --- In sivacharya@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Namaste Kris and others,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Please tolerate some more freewheeling comments from me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; It&#39;s all good fun if we don&#39;t take such claims\n&gt;&gt; &gt; too seriously. Posturing seems to come with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the territory to some extent.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Rishis were very open-minded and had a perfectly integrated knowledge of \n&gt;&gt; all\n&gt;&gt; aspects of the Unlimited (Brahman, non-dual Supreme Self) as well the\n&gt;&gt; Limited (Maya, i.e. manifestation of Brahman as the dual world). They\n&gt;&gt; understood Brahman as well as Maya and had mastery over both domains.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; We are now in Kali Yuga and it is inevitable that biases, \n&gt;&gt; narrow-mindedness\n&gt;&gt; and posturing enter the mindsets of many learned.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; As long as one is living the dual reality, the duality enters all things.\n&gt;&gt; Polarization is the very nature of duality. Good and bad, beautiful and\n&gt;&gt; ugly, powerful and weak, learned and ignorant - all these seemingly \n&gt;&gt; opposite\n&gt;&gt; polarities are a creation of the duality. Even when it comes to spiritual\n&gt;&gt; progress and reaching god, there are polarities. There are seemingly\n&gt;&gt; opposing paths. One scripture says one thing and another says the \n&gt;&gt; opposite.\n&gt;&gt; One may take one word of one scripture as the ultimate Truth and another \n&gt;&gt; may\n&gt;&gt; take another word of another scripture as the ultimate Truth. \n&gt;&gt; Unfortunately,\n&gt;&gt; all the knowledge we get from books, gurus etc is still in the domain of\n&gt;&gt; duality and not free from the phenomenon of opposites.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; The only solution is to be firmly established in the non-dual Supreme \n&gt;&gt; Self\n&gt;&gt; at all times and see each thing in the dual world for what it truly is, \n&gt;&gt; i.e.\n&gt;&gt; yet another manifestation of the very same non-dual Self.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Such a state was achieved by so many rishis in the past. In this age,\n&gt;&gt; however, such rishis are so rare. No wonder there is too much posturing \n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; disagreement.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Your passage on Kaali bhakta was interesting as\n&gt;&gt; &gt; it points to a different outcome. Divine intoxication\n&gt;&gt; &gt; versus no experience and no mind. Perhaps both\n&gt;&gt; &gt; are experienced at some point in the path?\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Yes, there were (and are) those who experienced both. However, there are\n&gt;&gt; some who reject one of the two in favor of the other. Actually, one would \n&gt;&gt; be\n&gt;&gt; most fortunate to reach either state.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you look at the &quot;star in the sky&quot; analogy I gave earlier, you will see\n&gt;&gt; different goals in Dwaita, Visishtadwaita and Adwaita paths. Some people\n&gt;&gt; following one approach do not entertain notions corresponding to another\n&gt;&gt; approach. However, some take them as diferent stops in the same journey.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I just want to make one more comment that is not directly relevant to the\n&gt;&gt; discussion, but touches it on the periphery. May those who find my views \n&gt;&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; analogies silly kindly ignore me.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Hard-core Adwaitis are essentially Vedantis and jnaana (gyaana) yogis. \n&gt;&gt; This\n&gt;&gt; path is appropriate for someone who is already quite evolved. If one is \n&gt;&gt; too\n&gt;&gt; deeply sunk in the delusion of this dual world appearance, it is a \n&gt;&gt; difficult\n&gt;&gt; path. It is like telling someone who wants to reach the sky, &quot;you are\n&gt;&gt; already in the sky. Just realize it and be done&quot;. The poor guy is very \n&gt;&gt; much\n&gt;&gt; on earth and can by no means &quot;realize&quot; that he is &quot;already in the sky&quot;.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; One who is rooted on earth and wants to reach the sky needs to engage in\n&gt;&gt; some actions that elevate one and prepare one for reaching the sky. \n&gt;&gt; Various\n&gt;&gt; tantras and rituals help in that. These are more appropriate for many \n&gt;&gt; people\n&gt;&gt; than the path of Adwaita, jnaana yoga and contemplation.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; However, if one gets too involved in building tall structures on earth, \n&gt;&gt; one\n&gt;&gt; may find it interesting and keep on building taller and taller structures\n&gt;&gt; and forget the ultimate goal of finally reaching the sky. Building tall\n&gt;&gt; structures will help one rise from earth, but not help one reach the sky.\n&gt;&gt; However tall a building one builds, it will still not take one to the \n&gt;&gt; sky.\n&gt;&gt; Reaching the sky is not about building tall buildings. Books and gurus \n&gt;&gt; can\n&gt;&gt; teach one how to build tall structures, but the final leap into the sky \n&gt;&gt; is\n&gt;&gt; untaught.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; In the analogy I am talking about here, Adwaitic self-realization is akin \n&gt;&gt; to\n&gt;&gt; reaching the sky. Normal state of a person is akin to being on earth.\n&gt;&gt; Building tall structures on earth is akin to engaging in various tantras,\n&gt;&gt; rituals and practices to progress spiritually.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; By engaging in more and more practices, one may experience more and more\n&gt;&gt; things and get some siddhis etc. This is akin to building tall structures\n&gt;&gt; and climbing them. Even as one builds tall structures, the final goal of\n&gt;&gt; reaching the sky should be at the back of one&#39;s mind. Otherwise, one can \n&gt;&gt; get\n&gt;&gt; lost in the practices and not reach the final goal.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; There is no fool-proof approach to have an Adwaitic self-realization. \n&gt;&gt; Even\n&gt;&gt; as one engages in various practices, one should keep the final goal at \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; back of mind. That is why I recommend reading Vedanta works like &quot;Yoga\n&gt;&gt; Vaasishtham&quot; and various Upanishats and keeping the high philosophy at \n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; back of mind even while engaging in various practices.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Enough for today..\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;&gt; Homam manual and audio: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt;&gt; ----------------------------------------------------------------\n\n\n"}}
