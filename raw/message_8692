It is not our japa, tapa, hav=\r\nen or other spiritual work which is cause of Darshan. No, it is Divine Grac=\r\ne which shows us the path. Everything comes under it.\n2-- Are you doing any=\r\n pranayam or breathing exercises on a regular basis. Rebirthing exercise is=\r\n lot like sudershankriya but much softer. Doing this or others will clear t=\r\nhe nadis in the body and will bring new light even once a week.\n\n3--- Are y=\r\nou doing any meditations in your very busy and responsible life. =A0Yoga ni=\r\ndra is a very good meditation and many times combining breathing exercises =\r\nand meditations even in 10/15 days works wonder.\n\n4--- I hope very much tha=\r\nt you have a focus of your japa like a Beautiful Picture of Divine Lord.\n\n5=\r\n--- Next time you go to Rishikesh, try to do some japa standing in SriGanga=\r\nji after doing prayers to Her. But please do not take any risks. When I did=\r\n it on opposite bank, in month of December people kept a eye on me. Being a=\r\n woman brings it own problem if there is no man there to support. But you d=\r\no not have to do it if you do not want it.\n\n6---You might notice feeling of=\r\n sex increases as the japa increases. It is a very difficult problem. You a=\r\nre a lucky person because you have women teachers in your ashram with whom =\r\nyou could talk. It is not that you need any advise because people come to y=\r\nou for that. But it is a very difficult problem to deal with in spiritual l=\r\nife\n\n7---Please do not put blockage by saying that you want Darshan even wi=\r\nth inner eye. Let Them decide. After all you want to see Them and They want=\r\n to see you.=A0\n\n8--- Relax. I hope you are not in any physical pain apart =\r\nfrom longing for Darshan. So take things easy. Let the spiritual energy slo=\r\nwly build up. Things will happen, Look for Divine Grace.\n\nThere are several=\r\n other things which I did. I am sure you will also know.\n\nLaxmiNarayan\n\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n________________________________\n From: sunrise_1080 &lt;sunrise_1080@yahoo.c=\r\no.uk&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Monday, 17 September 2012, 12=\r\n:53\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES\n \n\n\nHi LaxmiNarayanji=\r\n,\n\nI recently asked a senior monk at the Sivananda Ashram in Rishikesh as t=\r\no whether it is possible to have Darshan of Narayana i.e. see Him in the fo=\r\nrm described in all our scriptures with 4 arms, holding the conch, discus, =\r\nmace and lotus. I said to him, there are countless stories of devotees havi=\r\nng Darshan of their God, is it actually possible today, in this day and age=\r\n?\n\nHe said, yes most certainly! But he said Darshan of God means feeling th=\r\ne Divine Presence in yourself, and all things, living and non-living, in ev=\r\nery atom, everywhere. This, he said, is Darshan.\n\nI am continuing with japa=\r\n in the hope of one day getting to this stage of feeling the presence of Go=\r\nd everywhere at all times. \n\nHowever, having said that, I have not given up=\r\n the idea of &#39;seeing&#39; God (may be with the &#39;inner eye&#39;) in the form of Vish=\r\nnu and Krishna- yes, with mace, discus, flute and all!!\n\nThe Bhagavatam say=\r\ns that Dhruva, Prahlad, even the elephant king Gajendra saw Vishnu....then =\r\nwhy not me?!! Of course I&#39;ll have to do a lot of japa, a lot of sadhana, re=\r\nmove all negative emotions, become a paragon of virtue (Oh god!) but I beli=\r\neve that if I do, it&#39;s bound to happen. May take a few lifetimes though (bu=\r\nt I&#39;m going to try and do it this time, you&#39;ve got to try at least!).\n\nIf u=\r\nlta Rama nama could transform rogue Ratnakar into saint Valmiki, and grant =\r\nhim Darshan of Sri Rama, then why cannot Om NamoNarayana convert rogue Apar=\r\nna into saint Aparna one day and give her Darshan of Vishnu/Krishna....I be=\r\nlieve that the mantra can do anything. Anything. We&#39;ll all be saints one da=\r\ny....ain&#39;t got no choice, He&#39;ll see to it. :)\n\nThanks for the message. :)\n\n=\r\nAparna\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishriha=\r\nri@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi,\n&gt; =A0 =A0 I still cannot understand why it is wrong =\r\nto have a spiritual experiences or to think about them. After all we cannot=\r\n go to a shop and just buy them. If we are doing sadhana and we need suppor=\r\nt they are going to happen. Why deny them? Suppose someone is doing the com=\r\nplete purscharan =A0of mantra, is to wrong =A0not to expect something amazi=\r\nng might happen at the end of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some years ago there was a Hindi aut=\r\nhor who was well off and had a Temple in their home for several generations=\r\n. Something happened in this authors life and he felt lot of trauma and cou=\r\nld not find mental peace. In his later life he took up doing prayers and ja=\r\npa etc as he was taught in his younger days. One night his daughter said to=\r\n him, you are doing so much prayers etc, have you had any experiences.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n The author became upset and said, no, he had not any experiences. Many tim=\r\nes he thinks that he is siting in front of a stone in the temple and it is =\r\nall useless. But he will not give up his prayers as his time is coming near=\r\ner.\n&gt; Next morning when this author was in his Temple and priest was doing =\r\nManglaAarti, The Deity\n&gt; Spoke to him and comforted him.\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0Several da=\r\nys later when he went to a famous Temple in Rajasthan, again the Divine Lor=\r\nd spoke to him there and comforted him and said there is no difference betw=\r\neen Him and Deities in his home Temple.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I read this story I knew =\r\nimmediately it was a true story. Very similar things have happened with me =\r\nto help me and comfort me.=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; We are going from A to B. Is it a relent=\r\nless journey? Are there no breaks, petrol stations or shops where we can ge=\r\nt out and stretch ourselves. Are there any road signs. Spiritual experience=\r\ns are like these. They guide us and show us if we are on a right path.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I was thinking of writing to this devotee who had this powerful experience=\r\n in Temple. Please write about it. What you experienced and what really hap=\r\npened. It will give knowledge to others. But then I realised that I am a lo=\r\nne ranger here and many times go against the stream.\n&gt; \n&gt; =A0Many people ar=\r\ne very young here and take NarasimhaBhai as their guru or spiritual adviser=\r\n. So if guruji is saying something, chela and clients cannot go against it.=\r\n Othewise their fire-pot, ghee-pot and coco-pot will be confiscated.=A0\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; I was also like this in my life. I took diksha=A0 from my Late Uncle who =\r\nwas famous in his days.\n&gt; When I tried to talk to him about Darshan of Divi=\r\nne Lord, he became very negative and said it is not possible. I kept very q=\r\nuite. I did not try to give examples of saints like Tulsidas or others who =\r\nhad Darshan. I had not done any spiritual sadhana and so no personal experi=\r\nences.\n&gt; .=A0\n&gt; Since then my life has changed due to different spiritual e=\r\nxperiences. Sure I am still in lot of pain and not in a complete bliss all =\r\nthe the time but I know Divine Beings can very easily give Darshan And havi=\r\nng spiritual experiences are very helpful for spiritual growth.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks=\r\n\n&gt; LaxmiNarayan\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\n|| Om ShaantihS=\r\nhaantihShaantih ||\nYahoo!

I said to him, there are countless s=\r\ntories of devotees having &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-24&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Darshan&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt; of their God, is it actually possible today, in this day and age?&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;He said, yes most certainly! But he said &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-25&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Darshan&lt;/span&gt; of God means feeling the Divine Presence in yourse=\r\nlf, and all things, living and non-living, in every atom, everywhere. This,=\r\n he said, is &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-26&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Darshan&lt;/span&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;I am continuing with &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-27&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;japa&lt;/span&gt; i=\r\nn the hope of one day getting to this stage of feeling the presence of God =\r\neverywhere at all times. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, having said that, I have not give=\r\nn up the idea of\n &#39;seeing&#39; God (may be with the &#39;inner eye&#39;) in the form of=\r\n Vishnu and Krishna- yes, with mace, discus, flute and all!!&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The &lt;sp=\r\nan id=3D&quot;misspell-28&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Bhagavatam&lt;/span&gt; says that &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-29&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Dhruva&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-30&quot; cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Prahlad&lt;/span&gt;, even the elephant king &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-31&quot;=\r\n class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Gajendra&lt;/span&gt; saw Vishnu....then why not me?!! Of course =\r\nI&#39;ll have to do a lot of &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-32&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;japa&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;, a lot of &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-33&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;sadhana&lt;/span&gt;, remove =\r\nall negative emotions, become a paragon of virtue (Oh god!) but I believe t=\r\nhat if I do, it&#39;s bound to happen. May take a few lifetimes though (but I&#39;m=\r\n going to try and do it this time, you&#39;ve got to try at least!).&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If =\r\n&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-34&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ulta&lt;/span&gt; Rama &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspe=\r\nll-35&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;nama&lt;/span&gt; could transform rogue &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspel=\r\nl-36&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Ratnakar&lt;/span&gt; into saint\n &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-37&quot; c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Valmiki&lt;/span&gt;, and grant him &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-38&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Darshan&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-39&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Sri&lt;/sp=\r\nan&gt; Rama, then why cannot Om &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-40&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Namo&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-41&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Narayana&lt;/span&gt; convert rogue=\r\n &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-42&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Aparna&lt;/span&gt; into saint &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-43&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Aparna&lt;/span&gt; one day and give her &lt;span id=\r\n=3D&quot;misspell-44&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Darshan&lt;/span&gt; of Vishnu/Krishna....I belie=\r\nve that the mantra can do anything.

After all we cannot go to a shop and just =\r\nbuy them. If we are doing &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-48&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;sadhana&lt;/=\r\nspan&gt; and we need support they are going to happen. Why deny them? Suppose =\r\nsomeone is doing the complete &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-49&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;pursc=\r\nharan&lt;/span&gt; &nbsp;of mantra, is to wrong &nbsp;not to expect something ama=\r\nzing might happen at the end of it.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Some years ago there w=\r\nas a Hindi author who was well off and had a Temple in their home for sever=\r\nal generations. Something happened in this authors life and he felt lot of =\r\ntrauma and could not find mental peace. In his later life he took up doing =\r\nprayers and &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-50&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;japa&lt;/span&gt; etc as he w=\r\nas taught in his younger days. One night his daughter said to him, you are =\r\ndoing so much prayers etc, have you had any experiences.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; T=\r\nhe author\n became upset and said, no, he had not any experiences. Many time=\r\ns he thinks that he is siting in front of a stone in the temple and it is a=\r\nll useless. But he will not give up his prayers as his time is coming neare=\r\nr.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Next morning when this author was in his Temple and priest was d=\r\noing &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-51&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;ManglaAarti&lt;/span&gt;, The Deity&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; Spoke to him and comforted him.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &nbsp;Several days=\r\n later when he went to a famous Temple in &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-52&quot; class=3D=\r\n&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Rajasthan&lt;/span&gt;, again the Divine Lord spoke to him there and comfo=\r\nrted him and said there is no difference between Him and Deities in his hom=\r\ne Temple.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; When I read this story I knew immediately it was=\r\n a true story. Very similar things have happened with me to help me and com=\r\nfort me.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; We are going from A to B. Is it a relentles=\r\ns journey? Are there no breaks, petrol stations or shops where we can get o=\r\nut and\n stretch ourselves. Are there any road signs. Spiritual experiences =\r\nare like these. They guide us and show us if we are on a right path.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I was thinking of writing to this devotee who had this powerful =\r\nexperience in Temple. Please write about it. What you experienced and what =\r\nreally happened. It will give knowledge to others. But then I realised that=\r\n I am a lone ranger here and many times go against the stream.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &nbsp;Many people are very young here and take &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-53=\r\n&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;NarasimhaBhai&lt;/span&gt; as their guru or spiritual adviser. S=\r\no if &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-54&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;guruji&lt;/span&gt; is saying someth=\r\ning, &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-55&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;chela&lt;/span&gt; and clients canno=\r\nt go against it. &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-56&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Othewise&lt;/span&gt; th=\r\neir fire-pot, ghee-pot and coco-pot will be confiscated.&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; I was also like this in my life. I took &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-57&quot;\n clas=\r\ns=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;diksha&lt;/span&gt;&nbsp; from my Late Uncle who was famous in his day=\r\ns.&lt;br&gt;&gt; When I tried to talk to him about &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-58&quot; class=\r\n=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Darshan&lt;/span&gt; of Divine Lord, he became very negative and said i=\r\nt is not possible. I kept very quite. I did not try to give examples of sai=\r\nnts like &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-59&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Tulsidas&lt;/span&gt; or others =\r\nwho had &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-60&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Darshan&lt;/span&gt;. I had not d=\r\none any spiritual &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-61&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;sadhana&lt;/span&gt; an=\r\nd so no personal experiences.&lt;br&gt;&gt; .&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Since then my life ha=\r\ns changed due to different spiritual experiences. Sure I am still in lot of=\r\n pain and not in a complete bliss all the the time but I know Divine Beings=\r\n can very easily give &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-62&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Darshan&lt;/span=\r\n&gt; And having spiritual experiences are very helpful for spiritual growth.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Thanks&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-63&quot;\n class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Lax=\r\nmiNarayan&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;-------------------------------=\r\n-----&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;|| Om &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-64&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Shaantih&lt;/span&gt; =\r\n&lt;span id=3D&quot;misspell-65&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Shaantih&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span id=3D&quot;misspel=\r\nl-66&quot; class=3D&quot;mark&quot;&gt;Shaantih&lt;/span&gt; ||&lt;br&gt;Yahoo!
