Some people use the tubes in which incense sticks (dhoo=\r\np or agarbatti sticks) are sold. Even with bamboo tubes, if air directly go=\r\nes from mouth into fire, it can carry saliva. The key is that air blown fro=\r\nm mouth should touch some surface (e.g. inside wall of bamboo tube) at an a=\r\nngle slightly less than 180 deg, get reflected and then go towards fire. Th=\r\nen, air touching fire will not have saliva in it. You can experiment by blo=\r\nwing air onto one palm by reflecting it off the other palm. You&#39;ll see =\r\nthat air coming to the latter is wet and the air coming to the former is dr=\r\ny. In any case, like I said, maintaining a good sized fire always is better=\r\n than letting it nearly extinguish and then resuscitate it by blowing air.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n &lt;br&gt;\nIdeally, one should not leave in the middle and stay till the en=\r\nd. If one must leave the area for a nature&#39;s call, one can add enough w=\r\nood (or other fuel) before the break.&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\nAfter the nature&#39;s call=\r\n, it is a good idea to take bath again. Some level of physical cleanliness =\r\nis to be maintained with external fire. One cannot say &quot;I am pure insi=\r\nde and why does external purity matter&quot;. Just as the internal fire is =\r\naffected by internal purity, external fire is affected by external purity.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n\n &lt;br&gt;\nWhen the external fire is strong, the internal fire tries to fol=\r\nlow it and resonate with it. So the rules of external fire must be obeyed. =\r\nIf a yogi with a very strong internal fire is doing homam, then actually th=\r\ne internal fire may dominate and the external fire may follow it and resona=\r\nte with it! Then the rules of external fire do not apply.&lt;br&gt;\n\n &lt;br&gt;\nBest r=\r\negards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n-------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------&lt;br&gt;\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish=\r\n textbook,&lt;br&gt;\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Hom=\r\nam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n                    &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n    =\r\n   Films that make a difference: &lt;a href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot; targ=\r\net=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n       Spirituality: &lt;a hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n    Jyotish writings: &lt;a href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n------------------------------=\r\n----------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n &lt;br&gt;\n---- S &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:tejomay=\r\na101%40yahoo.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;tejomaya101@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;          I remember reading somewhere( some book =\r\non homa vidhi) that the proper way to do this is to use a bamboo tube.

When fire is gett=\r\ning smaller, I offer ghee, sesame seeds&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; or wood to make =\r\nit bigger. One need not wait so long that fire is about to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; extinguish. One should make it bigger earlier.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; Ideally, there should be fire in a bigger part of homa kundam =\r\nthan smoke.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; If fire has gone out in a bigger part of the=\r\n homa kundam and there is smoke&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and if fire is present i=\r\nn a smaller part of homa kundam, that is&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inauspicious an=\r\nd ineffective. Lord Vishnu specifically taught that homam&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; should be done with more fire in homa kundam than smoke.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the habit of waiting till fire becomes so small=\r\n that it comes close&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; to extinguishing, is a bad one to s=\r\ntart with. One should maintain a bigger&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fire always.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *        *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When a sadhaka with a very thin kaarmik pipeline does som=\r\nething, the result&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is seen very soon. So, if one starts =\r\na wrong practice, one will see the&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; result soon and learn=\r\n one&#39;s lesson. When someone with a very deep kaarmik&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n pipeline starts engaging in a wrong practice, the result may be seen much&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; much later. By that time, one may have done that wrong t=\r\nhing too many times.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In the old days,=\r\n priests used to do intense sadhana and burn their karmas.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; Even if they did something wrong, they would quickly figure it out and&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; correct themselves. Many priests of today have very deep =\r\nkaarmik pipelines,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; do not do much sadhana and the Nature=\r\n&#39;s feedback system is broken.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; *  =\r\n      *        *&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; When a priest or som=\r\neone respectable does something incorrect, one can&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; speak=\r\n out if one thinks there is a reasonable chance of benefit from&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; speaking out. Some priests are open-minded and understanding, but s=\r\nome are&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; egoistic and they do not want to be corrected by=\r\n laymen.

Since&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; th=\r\nen&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; i desisted myself from celebrating my birthday b=\r\ny blowing candles too.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I wa=\r\nnted to stop this act of his..but again i thought that my &#39;fire&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; extinguishion(by blowing air through mouth)&#39; knowledge=\r\n may not be&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; relevant&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; for the hom=\r\nam fire and i should not interfere with the priest,who seemed&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; to&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be well experienced in performing homams.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; PLease comment something ab=\r\nout this and enlighten us with your knowledge&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; so&lt;br&gt;\n&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; that i will be careful from next time. Also, if there are =\r\nany other&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ingredients specific for mahalakshmi homa=\r\nm, please suggest us.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n    \n    &lt;div style=3D&quot;=\r\ncolor: rgb(255, 255, 255); min-height: 0pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/=\r\nblockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--20cf30549f69da64a404a1e5be0b--\r\n\n"}}
