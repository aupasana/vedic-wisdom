Even so called Vedic Sadha=\r\nnas are often done for material gains. Recall how most of the Sanskrit stot=\r\nras of various deities contain a phalastuti (the expected results), is that=\r\n not material gain? Doing a Mahamrityunjaya Mantra for health benefits, isn=\r\n&#39;t that a material gain? It is not the path, but the attitude of the sadhak=\r\na which determines for what he/she is performing a certain sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Yogis and/or those who do sadhana using &#39;Vedic&#39; tools also acquire siddhis=\r\n. Yogis acquire siddhis, which can come as a byproduct of the path. The pro=\r\nblem is not with siddhis per se, it is with misusing them or commercializin=\r\ng them or hanging on to them. Any sadhaka who can gain a siddhi, can also l=\r\net go of that siddhi whenever he/she wants. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Speaking of Karma, eve=\r\nrything has a karma of it&#39;s own. Tantra, as it stands today, is roughly div=\r\nided into two major geographic and philosophical demarcations. The style pr=\r\nacticed in South India - mostly Dakshina Margi - and that practiced in Beng=\r\nal and adjacent areas - mostly Vama Margi. In my personal opinion, the adhe=\r\nrents of the path in both cases, generally speaking, have been trapped in t=\r\nwo delusions born out of collateral byproducts of their respective paths. T=\r\nhe first step of Shakti sadhana is generating shakti. Second step is holdin=\r\ng the shakti. Third step is channeling the shakti. In view of this, one sch=\r\nool of Tantra that is prevalent today has tied itself up in too much of tec=\r\nhnicalities, such that on an average they forget to capture shakti (here sh=\r\nakti means energy, not Shakti the supreme Goddess). WHile the other school =\r\nis able to generate and hold shakti much better, only to commercialize the =\r\nsame and/or misuse it (generally speaking,\n&gt;  expcetions are there too). En=\r\nd result, both eventually do not end up producing enough genuine Tantrik sa=\r\nints.\n&gt; \n&gt; &lt;&lt;\n&gt; i am wondering &quot;if at all&quot; and &quot;what kind&quot; of karmic liabil=\r\nities one might be getting into ?&gt;&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; A fair exchange is never a robbery=\r\n, as Vimalananda says. Theoretically, when the *right person* performs many=\r\n of the things mentioned in that blog, (and some of the stuff there is not =\r\nexactly accurately portrayed), he/she will know how to balance the karmic i=\r\nmpact well. In the hands of an immature individual, it can lead to disaster=\r\n. Further, the so called division between &#39;classical Tantra&#39; and &#39;folk Tant=\r\nra&#39; is not as sharp and clear as it is made out there. Each influences the =\r\nother and is very much intermingled.=C3=82=C2=A0 Every sadhana in Vama Marg=\r\ni Tantra has a firm spiritual basis.

Even so called Vedic Sadh=\r\nanas are often done for material gains. Recall how most of the Sanskrit sto=\r\ntras of various deities contain a phalastuti (the expected results), is tha=\r\nt not material gain? Doing a Mahamrityunjaya Mantra for health benefits, is=\r\nn&#39;t that a material gain? It is not the path, but the attitude of the sadha=\r\nka which determines for what he/she is performing a certain sadhana.&lt;br&gt;\n&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Yogis and/or those who do sadhana using &#39;Vedic&#39; tool=\r\ns also acquire siddhis. Yogis acquire siddhis, which can come as a byproduc=\r\nt of the path. The problem is not with siddhis per se, it is with misusing =\r\nthem or commercializing them or hanging on to them. Any sadhaka who can gai=\r\nn a siddhi, can also let go of that siddhi whenever he/she wants. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Speaking of Karma, everything has a karma of it&#39;s own.=\r\n Tantra, as it stands today, is roughly divided into two major geographic a=\r\nnd philosophical demarcations. The style practiced in South India - mostly =\r\nDakshina Margi - and that practiced in Bengal and adjacent areas - mostly V=\r\nama Margi. In my personal opinion, the adherents of the path in both cases,=\r\n generally speaking, have been trapped in two delusions born out of collate=\r\nral byproducts of their respective paths. The first step of Shakti sadhana =\r\nis generating shakti. Second step is holding the shakti. Third step is chan=\r\nneling the shakti. In view of this, one school of Tantra that is prevalent =\r\ntoday has tied itself up in too much of technicalities, such that on an ave=\r\nrage they forget to capture shakti (here shakti means energy, not Shakti th=\r\ne supreme Goddess). WHile the other school is able to generate and hold sha=\r\nkti much better, only to commercialize the same and/or misuse it (generally=\r\n\n speaking,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  expcetions are there too). End result, both eventuall=\r\ny do not end up producing enough genuine Tantrik saints.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &lt;&lt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; i am wondering &quot;if at all&quot; and &quot;what kind&quot; of karmic lia=\r\nbilities one might be getting into ?&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; A fair exch=\r\nange is never a robbery, as Vimalananda says. Theoretically, when the *righ=\r\nt person* performs many of the things mentioned in that blog, (and some of =\r\nthe stuff there is not exactly accurately portrayed), he/she will know how =\r\nto balance the karmic impact well. In the hands of an immature individual, =\r\nit can lead to disaster. Further, the so called division between &#39;classical=\r\n Tantra&#39; and &#39;folk Tantra&#39; is not as sharp and clear as it is made out ther=\r\ne. Each influences the other and is very much intermingled.=C3=82&nbsp; Eve=\r\nry sadhana in Vama Margi Tantra has a firm spiritual basis. Performed corre=\r\nctly, with the right attitude, and by the right individual, it leads to ver=\r\ny high spiritual states.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; -Regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;R=\r\najarshi&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Bazeec=\r\nha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Hota hain shab-o-roz tamasha mer=\r\ne aage&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere n=\r\nazdeek&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Ek baat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&gt; ________________________________&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  From: priyank_priyank &l=\r\nt;aks_day@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-=\r\nwisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40y=\r\nahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, 1=\r\n2 June 2012 10:14 AM&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Karmic liability for =\r\nTantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;\n&=\r\ngt; Hello all, &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; I have been following some tantra groups=\r\n and in tantra there seems to be 3 attitudes. &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 1. IShta =\r\nsadhana - complete surrender&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 2. Siddhi sadhana - for gaining speci=\r\nfic siddhi (part bhog part moksha)&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; 3. Material sadhana -=\r\n related to bhog part of life. you do this specifically for the result you =\r\nwant. here there are sadhanas right from kuber sadhanas to apsara/urvashi t=\r\no making pact with lot of entities (from ghosts to whatnot).&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; i am wondering &quot;if at all&quot; and &quot;what kind&quot; of karmic liabilities one m=\r\night be getting into ?&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; related reading&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;a rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://aghorpir.blogspot.in/2012/05=\r\n/classical-and-folk-tantra.html&quot;&gt;http://aghorpir.blogspot.in/2012/05/classi=\r\ncal-and-folk-tantra.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; regards&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; priyank&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/di=\r\nv&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1355684428-1279887156-1339696822=:21220--\r\n\n"}}
