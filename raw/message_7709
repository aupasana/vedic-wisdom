It is not at\n&gt; all a good idea to extinguish fire forcibly. If keeping tens of wicks\n&gt; burning is not practical, put very little oil in each wick so that it\n&gt; lights for a small time only. If you can&#39;t wait, then don&#39;t light so\n&gt; many wicks. Just light 1-5 wicks and show them with all mantras. That is\n&gt; far better than showing a lamp with 21 wicks, another lamp with another\n&gt; number of wicks and so on and then forcibly extinguishing all the tens\n&gt; of wicks. Even if an auspicious material like rose petal is used to\n&gt; press and extinguish, that does not make it acceptable.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; || Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||\n&gt; Yahoo!
