In a private communication, Sri Svoboda ma=\r\nde some points that I liked. I am sharing it with you with his kind permiss=\r\nion.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Instead of focusing on offending gods or any other being=\r\ns, as some people do, please note that he focused on the prevailing gunas a=\r\nnd also on downward movement of apaana vaayu. Focused sadhana is meant to m=\r\nake apana move up (Kundalini moves up when praana and apaana meet) and some=\r\n physical conditions direct apana heavily downward (e.g. full bowels, month=\r\nly periods, full bladder).\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Of course, in the end, when one is dy=\r\ning, one MAY need to focus mind on god and make apana move up, under equall=\r\ny (if not more) challenging circumstances. But one can make things easy and=\r\n controlled, when still alive and practicing.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If I may add my=\r\n 2 cents of perspective to the learned opinion below, please keep in mind t=\r\nhat some highly taamasik men may be influenced by tamas more than some high=\r\nly saattwik women even in their first day of periods. Things are relative. =\r\nAlso, many people (men and women) do most of their sadhana when their apaan=\r\na is clearly directed downwards and does not move up at all. They do not ex=\r\nperience anything. Sadhana in such stages is for instilling discipline rath=\r\ner than making apaana move up and meet with praana.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0Best regards=\r\n,\n&gt; \n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Forwarded Message -----\n&gt; &gt;F=\r\nrom: Robert Svoboda\n&gt; &gt;To: Narasimha P.V.R. Rao\n&gt; &gt;Subject: Re: A commonly =\r\nasked question I need help on\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Namaste\n&gt; Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;P=\r\nersonally,\n&gt; I follow the 3-day rule: the first day of bleeding is ruled by=\r\n tamas,\n&gt; and the devi of that day is black. The second day is ruled by raj=\r\nas,\n&gt; and that devi is red; and the third day is ruled by sattva, and that\n=\r\n&gt; devi is white. During those first 3 days I believe it is better for a\n&gt; w=\r\noman to be away from everybody except other women; better for them\n&gt; not to=\r\n cook, clean &c; and better for them not to involve\n&gt; themselves in ritual.=\r\n After all, when apana is moving downwards\n&gt; strongly, why disturb vayu by =\r\nperforming some activity like puja &c\n&gt; that is meant to encourage vayu to =\r\nmove upwards?  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;After\n&gt; that, I think it depends on the woman. S=\r\nome women are basically\n&gt; balanced and even if they spot for a day or two m=\r\nore, the bleeding is\n&gt; effectively ended by the third day. Other women blee=\r\nd heavily for\n&gt; four or five days, during which time apana is clearly still=\r\n moving\n&gt; downward; in these cases, I think they are better off waiting unt=\r\nil\n&gt; the main flow ends.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;IMO\n&gt; during this period a woman can st=\r\nill do japa & internal\n&gt; meditation and naama japa, but in an easy, sahaja,=\r\n saumya fashion; no\n&gt; kathina prayogas EXCEPT when for certain tantrika rit=\r\nuals, e.g. if\n&gt; the centerpiece of the ritual is to offer menstrual blood, =\r\nit can be\n&gt; a big help to have an actual menstruating woman present, to inv=\r\noke\n&gt; that particular shakti.  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Generally\n&gt; I have found that so=\r\n long as the woman is sufficiently comfortable to\n&gt; be able to sit up, that=\r\n there is no problem for her to sit and watch\n&gt; someone doing a ritual, exc=\r\nept when that ritual is of a type where\n&gt; the very presence of a menstruati=\r\nng woman can disturb the delicate\n&gt; shakti that is being invoked. Sadly, I =\r\nhave found that most of the\n&gt; people who claim that a menstruating woman ca=\r\nn disturb them are\n&gt; people who are not as sensitive as they imagine themse=\r\nlves to be.  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;I\n&gt; often find that when I am myself doing homam a=\r\nnd a menstruating woman\n&gt; is sitting at the fire (which I usually permit so=\r\n long as the woman\n&gt; understands what she is doing), that the fire often do=\r\nesn&#39;t burn as\n&gt; well =E2=80&quot; this makes sense to me, and so I simply adapt =\r\nto the\n&gt; situation (e.g. by having plenty of ghee on hand!). Watching homam=\r\n is\n&gt; (I have found) generally OK, except that for some sensitive women the=\r\n\n&gt; activation of agnitattva heats them up in a way that they can&#39;t\n&gt; contro=\r\nl.  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;What\n&gt; does your heart tells you?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Best\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;RS  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;________________________________\n&gt; &gt; From: Narasimha =\r\nP.V.R.
