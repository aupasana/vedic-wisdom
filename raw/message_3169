They actually match in most years.\n \nAccording to the definition used today, Margasira month starts when Sun and Moon conjoin in Vrischika raasi, i.e. Moon is in Vrischika raasi at the end of Amaavaasyaa tithi when a new lunar month begins. If you look at the Pournima of such a month in the last 3 years, Moon was indeed in Rohini/Mrigasira or in Mrigasira/Aardra on the Pournima day. The standard definition results in the same reckoning most of the times. This year happens to be a border year where the two definitions are mis-aligned by one month.\n \nI believe the error in reckoning came in during the last millennium or so. The birth tithis of gods, rishis and yogis noted from the ancient times (e.g. Lord Rama&#39;s birth on Chaitra Sukla Navami, Dattatreya&#39;s birth on Margasira Pournima etc) must have been noted down using the &quot;correct definition&quot;. It is upto us now to iron out the correct definition now.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; Basically, what I mean is that, is there any way to know for sure\n&gt; if today is the real Dattatreya Jayanti irrespective whatever name\n&gt; we set for the month?\n \nI am afraid not, but a good question!\n \nThere is a different energy around us at different times. However, most of us are not capable of identifying it. A yogi with zero ego and very pure consciousness may be able to identify, but not others who see the world through the colors of their dense I-ness. How can one identify the color of an object seen through a dark window accurately, when the window darkens everything?\n \nI was mentioning to a yogi some Rudrabhaishekas that were happening here last month, on the occasion of Kaarthika month (supposed to be dear to Shiva). He actually told me, &quot;Narasimha, this somehow does not *feel* to me like Kaarthika month. There is some error somewhere.&quot;\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Your logic seems correct. Otherwise there is really no reasonable explanation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, then the question comes, is Dattatreya Jayanti on Maargasira Pournima or Kaarthika Pournima. I mean did the error in the names of months with respect to the actual lunar position creep in before or after it was decided that Dattatreya Jayanti is on Maargasira Poornima?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Because if it was BEFORE the error creeped in, that means the real Datta Jayanti IS on Mrigasira Purnima. IF the setting of Dattatreya Jayanti celebration happened AFTER the error was introduced, then that means the real Datta Jayanti is on Karthika Purnima. We come to know about the Dattatreya Jayanti from some Puranic texts. Not all of them were before the Kali Yuga started.  I hope you understand my confusion.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Basically, what I mean is that, is there any way to know for sure if today is the real Dattatreya Jayanti irrespective whatever name we set for the month?\n&gt;  \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Tue, 1/12/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

Is today really a Maargasira Pournima?\n&gt;  \n&gt; People name the lunar months these days based on the raasi occupied by Moon at the time of Sun-Moon conjunction, i.e. end of Amaavaasya. Sun-Moon conjunction in Pisces begins Chaitra month, in Aries begins Vaisakha month and so on. However, is this perfect or has an error been introduced in the last few millennia due to deepening Kali?\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you look at the names of months themselves, they are based on the star on Pournima (Full Moon day). For example, Moon is in Pisces (Poorvabhadra 4th paadam, Uttarabhadra, Revati) at the beginning of Chaitra month. But on the Pournima day that follows, he is in Chitra or its vicinity.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is likely that the zodiac was divided into 12 equal parts (not necessarily aligned with 12 rasis) and the position occupied by Moon at Full Moon of a month determined the name of the month. These 12 months were then named based on a main star in those 12 parts. Chitra star for Chaitra month, Visakha star for Vaisakha month, Jyeshtha star for Jyeshtha month and so on. Aaswayuja, Kaarthika, Maargasira and Pushya months are associated with Aswini, Krittika, Mrigasira and Pushya stars respectively.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though Dec 30/31, 2009 is supposed to be Pushya Pournima, Moon will be nowhere near Pushya star. He will instead be in Mrigasira and Aardra. That is likely to be the real Maargasira Pournima. Today is supposed to be Maargasira Pournima, but Moon is nowhere near Mrigasira. He is instead in Krittika for most of the day and in Rohini in the evening. This is likely to be Kaarthika Pournima.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org \n&gt;      Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com \n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, December 01, 2009 4:46 AM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dattatreya Jayanti\n&gt; \n&gt; Happy and auspicious Dattatreya Jayanti to everyone!\n&gt;  \n&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n\n\n"}}
