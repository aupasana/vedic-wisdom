Please read this po=\r\nst:\nhttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/8174\n\nBut, i donot t=\r\nhink there will be negative impact on visiting Tirupathi ahead. I\nstrongly =\r\nsuggest you that you can very well visit Tirupathi and go to\nSrikalahasti. =\r\nPersonally i have done it many times and also many does the same as i knew.=\r\n\n\nI am unsure that staying inside the temple during earlier night would not=\r\n be possible. Utmost you can be there till &quot;Ekantha Seva&quot;.\n\nYou can very we=\r\nll participate in Ekantha seva and one will have a sound spiritual experien=\r\nce during it. An idol of Shiva will be procession in a small &quot;Pallaki&quot; (dev=\r\notees will have chance to lift it)towards &quot;Addala mandapam&quot; near GnanaPraso=\r\nonambika&#39; shrine.Later, an idol of &#39;GnanaPrasoonambika maa&quot; also will be pl=\r\naced in the same &quot;Addala mandapam&quot; on an Unjal next to Shivan and the pries=\r\nt will recite the mantras of Ekantha Seva. While coming out of the temple\na=\r\nfter Ekantha seva, priest will invoke Kalabhairava to take care of.\n\nAs i h=\r\neard, Amavasya inline with Sunday + Rahukaalam will be the auspicious time\n=\r\nto perform this pooja. Be in ardent of devotion to Rahu-Ketu and\nSrikalahas=\r\nteeshwar during pooja.\n\nMay Sri Srikalahasteeshwara bless you.\n\nRegards,\nSr=\r\nini.\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, C Professionals &lt;h.suresha@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hi Vikram,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) If you are going for Rahu Ketu pooja =\r\n, then go to only that temple \n&gt; and you should not visit any other temple =\r\nwhile going and coming back.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Rahu ketu pooja which is done during r=\r\nahukaal is considered most \n&gt; auspicious.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) The best time preffered i=\r\ns After amavasya next coming \n&gt; Tuesday-rahukaal is the best time for that =\r\npooja.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4) You and your family (Who ever going there) should stay INSID=\r\nE temple \n&gt; for one night\n&gt; before the pooja. (That means all of you should=\r\n stay Monday night at \n&gt; temple.)\n&gt; \n&gt; 5) Note down the Rahukaal time on Tu=\r\nesday, and be there in temple at \n&gt; least 1hr prior,\n&gt; There will be a Que =\r\nfor pooja, stay in that Que, they will provide pooja \n&gt; materials buy them.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; 6) It is a very good experience, temple is very good, the environment=\r\n \n&gt; inside temple is pleasant.\n&gt; \n&gt; Enjoy!\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Suresha H\n&gt; \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On 2012/06/03 10:55 AM, vikram_singhvi wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Pranam,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Wondering if the learned members can enlighten me for Do&#39;s and Don&#39;t \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; for Pooja at Kalahasti temple.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am planning to visit Kalahasti t=\r\nemple during Aug&#39;12 with my family \n&gt; &gt; and perform Rahu ketu, and Sarpa do=\r\nsh pooja.
