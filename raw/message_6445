I am much delighted=\r\n to see Narasimha&#39;s message.\nEven Shri Balaram Basu uttered such words atta=\r\ncking family members & relatives during his daughter&#39;s marriage. i did not =\r\nappreciate that (They leaved with God).\nWhenever i came across this popular=\r\n idea in favor of Sanyaasa viz-a-viz scathing attack on family members, my =\r\ninternal voice never accepted that. All most every time, i used to think ab=\r\nout my Grand parents, My Mother & father, siblings, wife, uncle, Father&#39;s s=\r\nisters etc...and i never found them like &quot;leeches&quot;. in my personal case my =\r\nfamily and other relatives has done more for me than what i could do for th=\r\nem and still they feel vice versa. Almost everybody is selfish in varying d=\r\negree so if family members expect that their bare minimum needs are taken c=\r\nare so that they can lead normal life and that is a reasonable selfishness =\r\nin Sansaara.\n\nIn my opinion, a normal family, if they somehow get engaged i=\r\nn God worship everyday, would be a boon and there would be no need to run a=\r\nway from such family members.  \n\nThere is one personal little thing. Few ye=\r\nars back when i was still in Mumbai, once My mother seeing me doing a lot o=\r\nf spiritual practices everyday told me -&quot;Utpal, you are married, you have w=\r\nife and children, please do not run away from them and do not think of Sany=\r\nasa&quot; She was obviously very worried. I laughed heartily and then told her i=\r\nn a very firm, reassuring tone that she must not worry. I would never run a=\r\nway to jungle leaving them. Poor beloved Mother! She didn&#39;t know that there=\r\n is still a lot of Nishumbha power hiding inside me and staying with family=\r\n would not hinder the efforts of slaying the monster. on the contrary it wo=\r\nuld help in that. Fighting from inside the fort of attachments!\n\nTry to eng=\r\nage you family members in Worship. That is the best course for all of us fa=\r\nmily people.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, N=\r\narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have great re=\r\nspect for Swami Sivananda and commentary on &quot;Yoga \n&gt; Vaasishtham&quot; by his di=\r\nsciple Swami Venkatesananda is one of my favorite \n&gt; books.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, I=\r\n want to put my foot down and record my exception to some \n&gt; ideas expresse=\r\nd in this series. Swamiji may have been trying to inspire \n&gt; some sadhakas =\r\ninto the sannyasa order when he wrote this series and he \n&gt; goes a bit over=\r\nboard.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; all members of your family will clin=\r\ng to you like leeches\n&gt; &gt; till the end of your life\n&gt; \n&gt; I do not appreciat=\r\ne this tone at all. One can renounce if one wants. \n&gt; But, why belittle fam=\r\nily members and call them leeches?\n&gt; \n&gt; If one&#39;s wife wants to cling to one=\r\n, because of her conditioning and \n&gt; spiritual evolution, it is fine. She i=\r\ns not necessarily a bad person or \n&gt; a &quot;leech&quot;. If one engages in dharmik a=\r\nnd unselfish actions to make one&#39;s \n&gt; wife happy in various ways, as far as=\r\n possible, it is not bad and does \n&gt; not imply an undesirable attachment. I=\r\nf one *expects* something from \n&gt; wife in return, THAT expectation is bad. =\r\nTHAT expectation of something \n&gt; back from wife is a leech that sucks blood=\r\n from one&#39;s soul.\n&gt; \n&gt; Seeing the world, people and objects as obstructions=\r\n or temptations or \n&gt; &quot;leeches&quot; is silly. Being disgusted with the world is=\r\n as much an \n&gt; attachment (a negative attachment) as is being fascinated wi=\r\nth it! World \n&gt; and people can exist and act in ways that may be natural to=\r\n them. \n&gt; Whatever they do, they are never the problem or blockage for your=\r\n own \n&gt; spiritual evolution. You may do various actions and give various th=\r\nings \n&gt; to various people, based on kaarmik debts, and nothing you do is \n&gt;=\r\n necessarily a bondage. Actions never bind you, it is expectation of \n&gt; spe=\r\ncific results from those actions that binds you. Give freely and \n&gt; magnani=\r\nmously; and take whatever comes back naturally, with no \n&gt; excitement and n=\r\no regret. Remove ANY expectation that may exist in your \n&gt; mind, from ANYON=\r\nE, and become completely free. THAT is true sannyasa or \n&gt; renunciation, no=\r\nt seeing people as leeches that cling on to you.\n&gt; \n&gt; If one becomes a sann=\r\nyasin because one is fed up with the world, it is \n&gt; probably a bad idea. W=\r\nhen one discharges most of one&#39;s duties and \n&gt; responsibilities to others, =\r\na sense of genuine renunciation will \n&gt; naturally develop. If one runs away=\r\n from the world prematurely, Nature \n&gt; will drag one back later.\n&gt; \n&gt; *    =\r\n    *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; When Adi Shankara renounced, his mother was very sad. B=\r\nut Adi Shankara \n&gt; did not see her as a leech. In fact, when she was on dea=\r\nthbed, he came \n&gt; all the way back and did her final rites himself, though =\r\nthat was \n&gt; completely against the traditional notions of sannyasa dharma. =\r\nThere is \n&gt; a big lesson in this.\n&gt; \n&gt; Actions and paying off your debts do=\r\n not bind you. In fact, inaction and \n&gt; pushing off a debt to future MAY bi=\r\nnd you! It is expectation in what you \n&gt; do and egoistic attachment to what=\r\n you do (feeling proud or ashamed) is \n&gt; what binds you.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *   =\r\n     *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; It is only when you take sannyasa that they will leave\n&gt; &gt; yo=\r\nu free.\n&gt; \n&gt; Even to a sannyasin, many people may cling. They may come for =\r\nknowledge \n&gt; or wisdom or to fulfil their pride related to doing good relig=\r\nious work. \n&gt; So many people clung to Vivekananda and other monastic discip=\r\nles of \n&gt; Ramakrishna. If one expects something back from such followers, \n=\r\n&gt; well-wishers and disciples (e.g. admiration, learning well, spreading \n&gt; =\r\nknowledge or message in the world, giving money for the religious order, \n&gt;=\r\n etc), there is no difference really between wife and children and them. \n&gt;=\r\n In other words, attachment can form and bind you.\n&gt; \n&gt; What binds you is y=\r\nour attitude towards people and your expectations \n&gt; from people and NOT ho=\r\nw much people like you and how attached THEY are \n&gt; to you. To be free, you=\r\n do not need people to &quot;leave you free&quot;. You can \n&gt; be surrounded by thousa=\r\nnds of people who are attached to you heavily and \n&gt; yet you can be free. T=\r\nheir attachment binds *them*. To be free, have no \n&gt; attachment and no expe=\r\nctations. Give other whatever your body, mind and \n&gt; soul allow you to give=\r\n. Have no expctations of getting anythying back. \n&gt; Take whatever comes bac=\r\nk by itself. Simple!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; When you fall sick You=\r\n will be tempted to go in for their help and \n&gt; &gt; vice versa.\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Vice ve=\r\nrsa&quot; is not a problem. Taking care of a sick person if one is \n&gt; able to, w=\r\nhether it is wife or parents or children or someone else, is \n&gt; not binding=\r\n. If there is an expectation of a return favor, THEN it is \n&gt; binding.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n Regarding taking help: Expecting anything from anyone causes bondage, \n&gt; b=\r\nut taking what comes by itself, with neither excitement nor regret, \n&gt; does=\r\n not cause bondage. Ma Sarada nicely demonstrated this once.\n&gt; \n&gt; When Swam=\r\ni Yogananda was badly sick, Ma Sarada asked his erstwhile wife \n&gt; (before s=\r\nannyasa!) to come and serve him. That is so unconventional! \n&gt; Swami Yogana=\r\nnda protested saying it will set a bad example. But Swami \n&gt; Yogananda did =\r\nnot have any expectations and this was done voluntarily by \n&gt; his wife (or =\r\nunder the instruction of Ma sarada, but not due to any \n&gt; expectations or p=\r\nressure from Yogananda). After Yogananda overcame his \n&gt; reservations, he w=\r\nas neither excited nor regretful. He accepted the \n&gt; service equanomously a=\r\nnd not worrying about what others will think or \n&gt; say.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, if on=\r\ne puts pressure on oneself and wants to prove to the world \n&gt; how good one&#39;=\r\ns renunciation us, THAT may be an attachment. &quot;Expecting&quot; \n&gt; the world to s=\r\nee one&#39;s renunciation and appreciate one (or not criticize \n&gt; one) is a ver=\r\ny subtle attachment. Ma Sarada may have detected a subtle \n&gt; attachment and=\r\n put Swami Yogananda in a spot intentionally and made him \n&gt; overcome the a=\r\nttachment. Great teachers like Ramakrishna and Ma Sarada \n&gt; teach subtle an=\r\nd valuable lessons in a practical way. It may not even be \n&gt; obvious to onl=\r\nookers that there was a lesson there! This is how sadgurus \n&gt; operate..\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Being able to renounce wife, children, parents, =\r\nsiblings, house, car etc \n&gt; is a great thing. But, if one thinks that those=\r\n are &quot;all connections and \n&gt; ties&quot; that bind one, one is badly mistaken. Th=\r\nose are the gross ones - \n&gt; the external ones. The biggest bondage is inter=\r\nnal. The identification \n&gt; with a body and identification with a subtle ind=\r\nividual identity (e.g. \n&gt; the notion that one is Narasimha, an engineer, a =\r\nscholar, an astrologer \n&gt; etc) are much stronger bondages than any others.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; If one&#39;s hands or legs are cut off or if a tiger is eating one alive o=\r\nr \n&gt; if one is suffering from a terrible disease, can one focus the mind on=\r\n \n&gt; god and not think of the body and its suffering? If one thinks &quot;*I* am =\r\n\n&gt; suffering&quot; and starts weeping, is one really free?\n&gt; \n&gt; If someone prais=\r\nes a sannyasin for his renunciation, devotion to god, \n&gt; wisdom or spiritua=\r\nl attainment, will no sannyasin feel even a little \n&gt; pride? If so, is one =\r\nreally free?\n&gt; \n&gt; If a sannayasin does sadhana and experiences some special=\r\n things or gets \n&gt; some siddhis, will it not give a little bit of pride or =\r\nsatisfaction? If \n&gt; so, is one really free?\n&gt; \n&gt; Focusing so heavily on ext=\r\nernal renunciation and making external objects \n&gt; of attachment seem like a=\r\n major thing, while ignoring the real \n&gt; attachment inside one (the sense o=\r\nf &quot;this is I&quot; and &quot;these are mine&quot;), \n&gt; is like beating up a tiger cub and =\r\nfeeling proud of the achievement, \n&gt; while ignoring the big tiget just lurk=\r\ning behind one and waiting to \n&gt; pounce on one!\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Let me say one thing clearly. Sannyasa or external renunciation is an \n&gt;=\r\n *attempt* to cut oneself off from a few external objects that cause \n&gt; tem=\r\nptation (and bondage!) internally. It is not a guarantee that \n&gt; internal t=\r\nemptations and bondages are completely destroyed. The real \n&gt; bondage comes=\r\n from the internal attachment and not from the external \n&gt; objects. Work ha=\r\nrd on removing it. Do not despise the external objects \n&gt; or see them as &quot;l=\r\neeches&quot; or become fed up with them.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyo=\r\ntish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; r=\r\nitual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a difference: http://Sara=\r\nswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wi=\r\nsdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;=\r\n                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Jun 3, 2011 at 2:00 PM=\r\n, chaudhuri.krishnendu wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     Sannyasa has got its own glory and a=\r\ndvantages!
