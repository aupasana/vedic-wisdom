Replace &quot;krishnam&quot; with \n&quot;hanumantam&quot;, &quot;kleem krishnaaya namah&quot; with &quot;ham hanumate namah&quot;, \n&quot;krishnaaya&quot; with &quot;hanumate&quot;, &quot;krishnasya&quot; with &quot;hanumatah&quot;, &quot;krishnah&quot; with \n&quot;hanumaan&quot;, &quot;krishna&quot; with &quot;hanumat&quot; etc. Use haam, heem, hoom, haim, haum, \nhah for nyaasas. For beeja, shakti, keelaka, use haam, heem, haum. It is \nactually fine to read a verse of Hanuman and say &quot;atra aagachchha, aavaahito \nbhava&quot; etc.\n\nFor pradhaana homam, the BEST is Hanuman Chalisa. Even though it is not in \nSanskrit, it is a very very powerful mantra as it was composed by a \nself-realized man. (What one writes or composes is infused with the gunas of \none&#39;s mind at the time. For example, if a scholar writes something with an \negoistic mind and with pride, the writing is infused with those gunas. \nSuppose someone writes a mail on this list when the mind is in a sublime \nstate of god contemplation, the mail is infused with sattwa and can benefit \npeople better. Similarly, the state of a mind that composed a prayer infuses \nthe prayer with certain gunas. In my view, Tulsidas was a self-realized man \nby the time he composed Hanuman Chalisa and the purity of his mind, devotion \nand humility were infused into that composition. Similarly, most prayers \nwritten by Adi Shankara vibrate with the energy of a man full of god \nrealization and also viveka - spiritual discrimination - of the highest \nkind.)\n\nAnother option is &quot;Om Ham Hanumate Namah&quot;. Or you can pick ANY shloka of \nHanuman and repeat it as many times as you can (e.g. atulita balaadhaamam.., \nmanojavam maarutatulyavegam..., aanjaneyamatipaatalaananam.., \ngoshpadikritavaaraasim..., buddhirbalam yashodhairyam... etc). Pick any ove \nverse you like and repeat it as many times as you can. You can also use the \ndwadasa naama stotra (hanumaan anjanaasoonuh vaayuputro mahaabalah...) or \nbreak it up into dwaadasa naamaavali (on hanumate namah, om anjanaasoonave \nnamah, om vaayuputraaya namah etc). Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra is also \npowerful if you know it and like it.\n\nSeveral options are there. But, if you know Hanuman Chalisa, it is THE best.\n\n&gt; I am new for this groups and my english not so good, I have done\n&gt; Ganapathi homam for 2 month,and I feeling better something\n&gt; difreance than before.I wii be very thankfull for this type\n&gt; message given us.\n\nIf you keep doing homam regularly for a few years, you will see a big \ndifference in your personality and way of thinking. After all, the goal of \nsadhana is to change one from inside. Attitudes built over many lives cannot \nbe destroyed in a day, but they can be slowly undone over a few years of \nintense sadhana. Homam is undoubtedly a very effective form of sadhana. I am \nglad you are finding some difference. Keep doing it. Good luck with Hanuman \nHomam.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message -----\nNamaste ,\n I am new for this groups and my english not so good ,I have done Ganapathi \nhomam for 2 month,and I feeling better something difreance than before.I wii \nbe very thankfull for this type message given us.\nFor krishna homam procedure is there any problem if I use as for my ishta \ndevata Sri hanumam or what are the procedure for hanumam homam Or the \nmantras for Pradhaana Homam (main part)& Parivaara Devata Aahutis & Dhayanam \n& praana pratishthaapanaa , if you can let know this mantras then i will \nfollow and amend it in Krishna homam.\n\n\n"}}
