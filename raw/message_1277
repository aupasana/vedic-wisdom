Invoke Vighneshwara in an idol \nmade with turmeric paste. Do a shodasopachaara pooja to Vighneshwara. Then \ntake a sankalpa to do the main homam (e.g. Mahaganapathi homam). Call back \nVighneshwara. Invoke Varuna in kalasha with &quot;imam me&quot; and &quot;tattvaayaami&quot; \nmantras (veda mantras). Do shodasopachaara pooja to Varuna. Then read \nPunyaahavaachanam (Pavamaana sooktam). Call back Varuna and sprinkle a bit \nof kalasha water all around.\n\nThen start the fire. There are few additional procedures including the \ninvocation of Brahma and Varuna in small water bowls with darbhas on then \nand quick pooja to them with akshatas. After the poorvaangam, call \nMahaganapathi into fire and do shodasopachaara pooja. Then do the mantras \nyou want. Do a shodasopachaara pooja again at the end. Do uttaraangam with \navijnaataadi praayaschitta mantras etc just as in the short procedure. But \none can optionally do Jayaadi homam also in the uttaraangam. It is a bunch \nof aahutis for various celestial beings with veda mantras. The rest is \nsimilar to the short procedure.\n\nI have done big ones as well, including 7-hour Mahaganapathi homam and \n9-hour Chandi homam. But I have no doubt that a short homam repeated \neveryday is more effective than a long homam done once in a while.\n\n*        *        *\n\nI once saw some priests performing a Mahaganapathi homam and Navagraha \nhomam. The priest declared, &quot;all the bad karmas of whoever is present here \nare burned today and all of you will start on a clean slate now.&quot; Though \nthey did a detailed ritual, the actual mantras of Ganesha and planets were \ndone to the minimum. For example, they offered the mantra of each planet \njust 4 times! For such a small count of mantras to actually burn all the \nkarmas of 100 people, the performer has to be a rishi or something! I was \namused by the declaration.\n\nObviously, they were under time pressure and made a wrong tradeoff.\n\nThe point I wanted to make is this. If you are able to do the main thing in \na ritual for 2 hours, then it is reasonable to have 30 minutes of overhead. \nIf you have only 40 minutes, it is a bad idea to spend 30 minutes on the \noverhead and wrap up the main thing in 10 minutes. It is better to do the \noverhead in 10 min and do the main part for 30 min. It is better that way.\n\nSometimes, I see learned priests making the wrong tradeoffs when pressed for \ntime. In this age, most people are pressed for time. They need help to make \nthe correct tradeoffs so that they maximize the impact of the little they \nget to do.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;arnabhalderdruk&quot; &lt;arnabhalderdruk@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Monday, February 23, 2009 12:49 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] homam procedure\n\n\n&gt; thank u for ur ganpati  homam procedure but i am very curious to know\n&gt; about the brihat (long)procedure to do homa.\n&gt;\n&gt; with lots of respect and pranam\n&gt; arnab\n\n\n"}}
