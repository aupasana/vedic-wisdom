By craving, demanding, crying or wishing,=\r\n it normally does not come.\n\nWhat should be the motivation for it? I don&#39;t =\r\nknow. Generally there is no specific material motivation other than, possib=\r\nly if it can be called a motivation, one moves to a state of sthitapragya -=\r\n or stable-knowledge, where one can remain unaffected and abide in a strong=\r\n equanimity and spiritual light ,at least internally, inspite of things whi=\r\nch are apparently nice and those which are apparently not nice. In such a s=\r\ntate one is not so much bothered about whether this species called humans m=\r\nust survive or not, but rather one remains in tune with the Cosmic Will. If=\r\n this species, speaking from an evolutionary viewpoint, is fit to carry on =\r\nit will, else it must perish and Nature will evolve some other form(at) to =\r\nact as a vehicle for the consciousness, which is what all lifeforms finally=\r\n are.\n\nThe Buddha did practice a lot of penance before he transformed into =\r\nthe Tathagata and if we are to believe his own words as it comes to us from=\r\n the Jataka tales, he had been born 500 times before he became the Buddha.\n=\r\n\nIt is good to believe that we will transform right now, it is another matt=\r\ner to actually be able to do so. Mostly, an instantaneous change never real=\r\nly happens. A few lifetimes is a fair measure of time for such a difficult =\r\ntask. Those who can transform now must have been trying so for a few lifeti=\r\nmes.\n\nThe bottomline is that, there is just no shortcut for any genuine tra=\r\nnsformation. There never was, there never will be. \n \n-Regards\n Rajarshi\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Prasad Pavitram &lt;vimal992000@...&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Narasimha=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =\r\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0 =C2=A0In the last two lines of your post you sa=\r\ny something like this..\n&gt; \n&gt; In each path, one may walk the path without ma=\r\nking any significant progress for a long time.

Let m=\r\ne try to put all this into a perspective here.=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Now my understand=\r\ning is that all these four different path lead to the same point or the end=\r\n result and that is self realization. No matter what path or approach you t=\r\nake the end result or the truth has to be the same. It cannot be two differ=\r\nent thing for two different people and in that case it is not the Truth. Th=\r\ne path one adopts may be of hindu persuasion or some other religious persua=\r\nsion the end result has to be the same. Not only the end result one has to =\r\ncome to a point where one has an insight or a perception that finishes the =\r\nego or self directed activity.=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Karma is a natural result of the =\r\nfreedom that Nature has bestowed upon man. Karma has no meaning without fre=\r\nedom to act. I do mistakes and create imbalance only when I have freedom to=\r\n act and as such I have pay it back and restore balance in Nature. To have =\r\nthe freedom to act I have to accept Karma too. It all makes perfect sense t=\r\no me.=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Now due to karmic overload it may become very hard for lar=\r\nge numbers of people to get out of this cycle. I am not sure if Nature allo=\r\nws one to be free of this attachment without a payback. Now there is a trai=\r\nn of thought which says that one can look into the whole nature of this att=\r\nachment at one shot and can be free of it. Instead of fixing one thing afte=\r\nr another look at this whole thing to the root , have a perception and get =\r\nout of it. In a sense our ancestors were intelligent that they devised some=\r\n way to clear this Karma but it seems like for large numbers of people thes=\r\ne will become crutches rather than help to get out of the karmic cycle and =\r\nlead an existence where one is free to act. If my previous karma is influen=\r\ncing my action then I am not free.=C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it possible for someone to=\r\n look into this whole process of attachment and have an insight and be free=\r\n of it right now....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  From: Nara=\r\nsimha P.V.R.

An awakene=\r\nd sadhaka practicing jnana yoga starts to honestly contemplate one&#39;s action=\r\ns, words, thoughts (and even instincts finally) and slowly weeds out condit=\r\nioning that makes one look at different transient things differently. As hi=\r\ns equanimity increases, still there will be episodes of getting carried awa=\r\ny. As he employs contemplation and self-correction more and more, such epis=\r\nodes will become less and less frequent and one will become liberated in th=\r\ne end.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; An unawakened sadhaka practicing karma yoga passionately =\r\nengages in dharmik actions for the benefit of others. He gets elated and fe=\r\nels proud when good results come and becomes upset when bad results come. A=\r\nn awakened sadhaka practicing karma yoga starts to have detachment to resul=\r\nts. When something happens which makes him elated, proud, ashamed or upset,=\r\n he will not think much about it, take it as god&#39;s prasad and think about w=\r\nhat is the right action for him right now. As his detachment increases, sti=\r\nll there will be episodes of getting carried away. As one becomes more and =\r\nmore detached (to results of actions), such episodes will become less and l=\r\ness frequent and one will become liberated in the end.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; An unawak=\r\nened sadhaka practicing raja yoga goes through yama, niyama, pratyahara, dh=\r\nyana, dharana etc. His psychic life force may even arise and ascend. He may=\r\n have various experiences and may feel proud or become attached to them. An=\r\n awakened sadhaka practicing raja yoga will not not lose self-control in th=\r\ne face of anything and will keep the focus on samadhi. He will not be distr=\r\nacted by anything that comes on the way and keep perfecting concentration a=\r\nnd self-control so that samadhi (deep concentration on the unconditioned Se=\r\nlf) comes. In the beginning, one may be in samadhi state now and then. As p=\r\nractice is perfected, one can be in it all the time and become liberated.\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; An unawkened sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga is devoted to god and=\r\n worships him/her as much as one can, but will project his ego, conditionin=\r\ng and desires onto his worship and hence onto the god he worships. For exam=\r\nple, he may think &quot;I worship the highest god while that person worships a l=\r\nower god. I am better&quot; or &quot;I am worshipping god everyday. I will get so and=\r\n so result&quot; or &quot;I worship god more than that person. I am better&quot;. An awken=\r\ned sadhaka practicing bhakti yoga has little expectation, pride etc. Worshi=\r\np becomes not about him but about god! He worships god and marvels at the p=\r\nower that holds this cosmos together - the power that runs things infinitis=\r\nmally smaller than a boson and infinitely larger than a galaxy. He will loo=\r\nk at himself as a fully insignificant particle in front a supreme power. Hi=\r\ns desires, likes, dislikes, conditioning and agendas start to seem too insi=\r\ngnificant in front of contemplating about that supreme power. Even as that\n=\r\n&gt;  devotional spirit increases, there will be episodes when one becomes sel=\r\nf-centered in one&#39;s worship. But with practice, one loses oneself completel=\r\ny and surrenders completely to the supreme power and become liberated in th=\r\ne end.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; In each path, one may walk the path without making any si=\r\ngnificant progress for a long time.

Dont you=\r\n think all these yogas are NOT an end in itself but to prepare the mind for=\r\n awakening?? The purpose behind all this should be to free oneself from kar=\r\nmic bindings and be free of the =C2=A0bondage. That has to be the core purp=\r\nose of any type of yoga. To be free is to be awakened.=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;No =\r\nmatter what path you follow ultimately there should be a perception where o=\r\nne sees the thought for what it is and there is a cleansing of the action. =\r\nAnd there will be no karma when you are NOT bound to the action.

It is very much\n&gt; &gt;&gt; possible and in fact is a measure of self r=\r\nealized people.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Indeed, one can carve one&#39;s own niche by combi=\r\nning multiple paths. They are not meant to be mutually exclusive.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;I&#39;ll quote Swami Vivekananda from his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; where he makes a=\r\n comment on the 4 paths:\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;&quot;Each soul is potentially divine. The=\r\n goal is to manifest this divinity\n&gt;  within by controlling\n&gt;  nature: exte=\r\nrnal and internal. Do this either by work or worship or psychic control, or=\r\n philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these - and be free.&quot;\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;Here are my 2 cents.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Jnana yoga emphasizes on philosophizatio=\r\nn and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on work and detachment. Raja yoga empha=\r\nsizes on self-control and self-mastery. Bhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion =\r\nand surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever is natural to one and try t=\r\no develop that quality. However, wisdom, detached action, self-control and =\r\nsurrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive. As one of these qualit=\r\nies develops nicely in one, others will automatically develop too! Finally,=\r\n a realized person (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or oneness) will have all these qual=\r\nities fully blossomed.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Forget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsam=\r\nsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of that, I strongly recommend against Ra=\r\nja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna advised\n&gt;  against it. Contro=\r\nlling body and mind and forcing the psychic life force to purify and ascend=\r\n requires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In this age of polluted a=\r\nir, water and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of obstructions and Raja=\r\n yoga can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what Ramakrishna expl=\r\nicitly taught in &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one of the greatest spiritual tex=\r\nts IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from pursuing Raja Yoga. He=\r\n taught it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him to practice it.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of fall=\r\ning into the delusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not s=\r\nincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that &quot;all is Brahma=\r\nn. I am Brahman. Whatever I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s all a del=\r\nusion anyway&quot; without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinfor=\r\nces duality in consciousness every instant. Kind\n&gt;  of like declaring wisel=\r\ny in a movie that &quot;it&#39;s just a movie and not reality&quot;, but flinching in eve=\r\nry scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty, si=\r\nncerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of =\r\nconstant contemplation and self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusi=\r\nonal jump to the end.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;IMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakt=\r\ni yoga and Karma yoga are the most suitable and safest.\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;Best r=\r\negards,\n&gt; &gt;Narasimha\n&gt; &gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;Astrology & Spirituality Resources: htt=\r\np://www.VedicAstrologer.org \n&gt; &gt;--------\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;--- In sohamsa@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, Vishnu Jandhyala &lt;jvishnu@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Dear Ms. Maja,\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Now different type of 4 yogas based on ayana/kend=\r\nra:\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dharma ayana - Gyana yoga- lagna and its trines\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;  &gt;=\r\n Artha ayana - Karma yoga -\n&gt;  10th bhava and its trines\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Kama ayana =\r\n- Raja yoga- 7th bhava and its trines\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Moksha ayana - Bhakti yoga - 4=\r\nth bhava and its trines\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagavat =\r\nGita, you can check it, I assure\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; there are four of them.

Do\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; you know how to see it?\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; *Also, one i=\r\ns supposed to choose only one ayana for one lifetime and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; master it t=\r\no as perfect as possible. *\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=C2=A0 I am not entirely sure =\r\nif the above statement is correct. It is very much\n&gt; &gt;&gt; possible and=C2=A0 =\r\nin fact is a measure of self realized people.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; *It is not possibl=\r\ne for a human being to take two or more ayanas at the\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; same time... w=\r\nell,\n&gt;  one can not go backwards and forward/left and right at\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; the s=\r\name time, can he/she? :)*\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Hmmm....well..............supp=\r\nose a Guru were to suggest to his/her pupil\n&gt; &gt;&gt; to stop a particular mantr=\r\na and instead do some other mantra, isn&#39;t that\n&gt; &gt;&gt; change of direction? Ar=\r\nen&#39;t mantras the harbinger of Gati (direction)? BTW,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; in sadhana, one h=\r\nas to begin with Karma yoga, then Bhakti, then Gnana and\n&gt; &gt;&gt; finally Raja =\r\nyoga.\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt; Benefits of Karma yoga ---&gt;Vinaya (Humility),\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Benefit=\r\ns of Bhakti yoga ---&gt; Viveka (Intelligence),\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Benefits of Gnana yoga --=\r\n-&gt; Vignana (Liberating knowledge),\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Benefits of Raja yoga ----&gt; Vichaks=\r\nhana (Wisdom) & Vimukti (Emancipation)\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Without vinaya there is no =\r\nviveka, without viveka there is no vignana,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; without vignana there is n=\r\no vichakshana, without vichakshana there is no\n&gt; &gt;&gt; vimukti! :-)\n&gt; &gt;&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n warm regards,\n&gt; &gt;&gt; Vishnu\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
