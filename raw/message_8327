With motives are *\nsa-kama*, lit. =93with desire=94 for=\r\n fruit and result. Without motives are *\nnish-kama*, =93without desire,=94 =\r\nonly to gain the purification leading to\nliberation.\n\n*Sa-kama* is of two k=\r\ninds (1) to fulfill a personal desire, such as: may my\nhusband=92s nature c=\r\nhange; may I grow rich, (2) a subtler kind is, I want to\nlive a life of pra=\r\nyer, worship [or service], but practical obstacles come\nin the way. =93I ca=\r\nnnot pray or serve because my husband won=92t let me as he\nbecomes jealous.=\r\n=94 To correct such situations, the practice is the same as\nthe first, but =\r\nwith an ultimate desire which is *nish-kama*. There the *\nsa-kama* desire i=\r\ns to pave the way for the *nish-kama* goal. Even the\ndesire for liberation =\r\nmay be dropped, and the mantra may be practised *\nguru-prity-artham*, for g=\r\nuru&#39;s satisfaction, to receive grace.\n\nThose that are done *sa-kama* may be=\r\n for specific purposes, such as to ward\noff or heal an illness, to prevent =\r\naccidents foretold, to prolong life, to\nalleviate financial problems, to ac=\r\nhieve a specific goal such as to be able\nto buy a house, or capture power, =\r\nor improve an organization, or regain\nfriendship, or eliminate someone&#39;s an=\r\nimosity towards oneself, and so forth.\n\nAnother subtle differentiation may =\r\nbe understood here. One may do such\nundertakings (a) for the purpose of sel=\r\nf-purification and liberation only,\nor (b) to obtain a desired result, or (=\r\n3) to attain the *siddhi*(s) of that\nmantra. The formula of =93number of sy=\r\nllables multiplied by hundred thousand\nplus twenty per cent=94 is definitel=\r\ny efficacious to achieve the *siddhi*,\nthat is to say, that one then has th=\r\ne powers inherent in the mantra and is\nable to use the mantra with just one=\r\n or three or such other minimum number\nof remembrances to attain a desired =\r\nresult for oneself or for one=92s\nstudents or seekers. (etc.)\n\n\n\nHope that =\r\nhelps!\n\nOn Tue, Jun 12, 2012 at 2:32 AM, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@yahoo.c=\r\no.in&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt; **\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt;  Dear Priyank,\n&gt;\n&gt; These three attitudes that you h=\r\nave named are for any sadhana, not just\n&gt; Tantra. Even so called Vedic Sadh=\r\nanas are often done for material gains.\n&gt; Recall how most of the Sanskrit s=\r\ntotras of various deities contain a\n&gt; phalastuti (the expected results), is=\r\n that not material gain? Doing a\n&gt; Mahamrityunjaya Mantra for health benefi=\r\nts, isn&#39;t that a material gain? It\n&gt; is not the path, but the attitude of t=\r\nhe sadhaka which determines for what\n&gt; he/she is performing a certain sadha=\r\nna.\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Yogis and/or those who do sadhana using &#39;Vedic&#39; tools also acquir=\r\ne\n&gt; siddhis. Yogis acquire siddhis, which can come as a byproduct of the pa=\r\nth.\n&gt; The problem is not with siddhis per se, it is with misusing them or\n&gt;=\r\n commercializing them or hanging on to them. Any sadhaka who can gain a\n&gt; s=\r\niddhi, can also let go of that siddhi whenever he/she wants.\n&gt;\n&gt; Speaking o=\r\nf Karma, everything has a karma of it&#39;s own. Tantra, as it\n&gt; stands today, =\r\nis roughly divided into two major geographic and\n&gt; philosophical demarcatio=\r\nns. The style practiced in South India - mostly\n&gt; Dakshina Margi - and that=\r\n practiced in Bengal and adjacent areas - mostly\n&gt; Vama Margi. In my person=\r\nal opinion, the adherents of the path in both\n&gt; cases, generally speaking, =\r\nhave been trapped in two delusions born out of\n&gt; collateral byproducts of t=\r\nheir respective paths. The first step of Shakti\n&gt; sadhana is generating sha=\r\nkti. Second step is holding the shakti. Third step\n&gt; is channeling the shak=\r\nti. In view of this, one school of Tantra that is\n&gt; prevalent today has tie=\r\nd itself up in too much of technicalities, such that\n&gt; on an average they f=\r\norget to capture shakti (here shakti means energy, not\n&gt; Shakti the supreme=\r\n Goddess). WHile the other school is able to generate and\n&gt; hold shakti muc=\r\nh better, only to commercialize the same and/or misuse it\n&gt; (generally spea=\r\nking, expcetions are there too). End result, both eventually\n&gt; do not end u=\r\np producing enough genuine Tantrik saints.\n&gt;\n&gt;  &lt;&lt;\n&gt; i am wondering &quot;if at =\r\nall&quot; and &quot;what kind&quot; of karmic liabilities one might\n&gt; be getting into ?&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; A fair exchange is never a robbery, as Vimalananda says. Theoretically,=\r\n\n&gt; when the *right person* performs many of the things mentioned in that bl=\r\nog,\n&gt; (and some of the stuff there is not exactly accurately portrayed), he=\r\n/she\n&gt; will know how to balance the karmic impact well. In the hands of an\n=\r\n&gt; immature individual, it can lead to disaster. Further, the so called\n&gt; di=\r\nvision between &#39;classical Tantra&#39; and &#39;folk Tantra&#39; is not as sharp and\n&gt; c=\r\nlear as it is made out there. Each influences the other and is very much\n&gt; =\r\nintermingled.  Every sadhana in Vama Margi Tantra has a firm spiritual\n&gt; ba=\r\nsis. Performed correctly, with the right attitude, and by the right\n&gt; indiv=\r\nidual, it leads to very high spiritual states.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n\n&gt;\n&gt; *\n&gt; Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.\n&gt; Hota hain shab-o-roz tam=\r\nasha mere aage\n&gt;\n&gt;  Ek khel hain aurang-e-sulemaan mere nazdeek\n&gt; Ek baat h=\r\nain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.\n&gt; *\n&gt;\n&gt;   ------------------------------\n&gt; *Fr=\r\nom:* priyank_priyank &lt;aks_day@...&gt;\n&gt; *To:* vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom\n&gt; *Sent:* Tuesday, 12 June 2012 10:14 AM\n&gt; *Subject:* [vedic-wisdom] Kar=\r\nmic liability for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello all,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have bee=\r\nn following some tantra groups and in tantra there seems to be 3\n&gt; attitude=\r\ns.\n&gt;\n&gt; 1.

Performed correctly, with the=\r\n right attitude, and by the right individual, it leads to very high spiritu=\r\nal states.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;=\r\nstrong&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana=\r\n;COLOR:navy;FONT-SIZE:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New Roman=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR:#000066&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:medium&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\nfont color=3D&quot;#a2a2a2&quot; size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Bazeecha-e-atfal hain duniya mere aage.&lt;/=\r\nfont&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR:#000066&quot;&gt;&lt;span s=\r\ntyle=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:medium&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#a2a2a2&quot;&gt;Hota hai=\r\nn shab-o-roz tamasha mere aage&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nb&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR:#000066&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:medium&quot;&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;COLOR:#000099&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:small&quot;&gt;&lt;font&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:medi=\r\num&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR:#999999&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Ek khel hain aurang-e=\r\n-sulemaan mere nazdeek&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:medium&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;COLOR:#999999&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;E=\r\nk baat hain ijaz-e-masiah mere aage.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:verdana,helvetica,sans-serif;FONT-SIZE:10pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-FAMILY:times new roman,new york,times,serif;FONT-SIZE:12pt&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div =\r\ndir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;\n&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WE=\r\nIGHT:bold&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; priyank_priyank &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:aks_day@y=\r\nahoo.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;aks_day@...&lt;/a&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;=\r\nFONT-WEIGHT:bold&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups=\r\n.com&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Tuesday, 12 June 2012 10:14 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nb&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;FONT-WEIGHT:bold&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; [vedic-wisdom] Karmi=\r\nc liability for Tantra &quot;material sadhana&quot;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div =\r\nclass=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;=A0&lt;/span&gt; \n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Hello all, &lt;br&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;I have been following some tantra groups and in tantra there seems to be =\r\n3 attitudes. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;1. IShta sadhana - complete surrender&lt;br&gt;2. Siddhi sad=\r\nhana - for gaining specific siddhi (part bhog part moksha)&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;3. Mater=\r\nial sadhana - related to bhog part of life. you do this specifically for th=\r\ne result you want. here there are sadhanas right from kuber sadhanas to aps=\r\nara/urvashi to making pact with lot of entities (from ghosts to whatnot).&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;i am wondering &quot;if at all&quot; and &quot;what kind&quot; of ka=\r\nrmic liabilities one might be getting into ?&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;related reading&lt;br&gt;&lt;a h=\r\nref=3D&quot;http://aghorpir.blogspot.in/2012/05/classical-and-folk-tantra.html&quot; =\r\nrel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;http://aghorpir.blogspot.in/2012/05/clas=\r\nsical-and-folk-tantra.html&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;regards&lt;br&gt;priyank&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;MIN-HEIGHT:0px;COLOR:#fff&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--e89a8fb201168a84d504c24676bc--\r\n\n"}}
