A Very nice explanation! \n  \nBest Reg=\r\nards\nShashi\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...=\r\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Shashi,\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Gopalers Ma was somebody who was immer=\r\nsed in god and\n&gt; &gt; still had such entities/beings around?\n&gt;  \n&gt; Shiva is go=\r\nd himself, but he is surrounded by many such beings/entities!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Please =\r\ndo not look at these beings as some kind of evil forces. They are not evil =\r\nforces. They are simply unfortunate souls in great misery, troubled by unde=\r\nsirable vasanas. They are not to be hated, but to be pitied and empathized.=\r\n\n&gt;  \n&gt; Yes, beings with evil intentions are unlikely to be present at the r=\r\nesidence of a saint like like Gopaler Ma.\n&gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Is it that such beings/en=\r\ntities cannot be helped or is it just\n&gt; &gt; wise to leave them alone if they =\r\ndo not want to be disturbed?\n&gt;  \n&gt; World runs on the basis of action and re=\r\naction. Any being that is in pain and stuck in a place is so due to some se=\r\nrious blocking karmas. Release of those karmas may be difficult. It is not =\r\neasy to help each and every being. You can only pick some to help and help =\r\nthem, guided by your own kaarmik debts. Moreover, you can help someone only=\r\n if they want to be helped.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; There is one mo=\r\nre thing here.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Even a self-realized person is limited in one&#39;s abilit=\r\ny to uplift other beings. An object (a person) may overcome its gravity (in=\r\ndividual ego and will) and start to freely flow in the wind (flow with divi=\r\nne will) without any resistance. But it cannot lift every object around it.=\r\n A big leaf that is freely floating in air can perhaps support a few insect=\r\ns. A big rock that is freely floating in air can perhaps support more being=\r\ns. A big hill that is freely floating in air can perhaps support far more b=\r\neings.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Like that, different beings are of different calibers in the f=\r\nield of duality, though all may be the same at the non-dual level. As they =\r\nbecome liberated from their conditioning, their ability to uplift others fr=\r\nom blocking conditioning varies from yogi to yogi.\n&gt;  \n&gt; But, I want to emp=\r\nhasize one thing here. A leaf is leaf, a rock is a rock and a hill is a hil=\r\nl. Leaf cannot become hill or hill cannot become rock. So, one cannot worry=\r\n about achieving this or that. Whether one is a leaf or a rock or a hill, o=\r\nne should try to overcome gravity and freely float. What one does after tha=\r\nt is not one&#39;s business, but the business of divine Will.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        * =\r\n       *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Your questions reminded me of a facebook message exchange I =\r\nsaw just a couple of days back. One member of this group sent a message to =\r\nManish and me and Manish replied to him. I will quote the facebook message =\r\nthread, without revealing the identity of the member.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Member: &quot;Yester=\r\nday night, I was feeling very very depressed for reasons both in the house =\r\nas well as work place and was mentally scolding everyone why this is happen=\r\ning to me. I drifted off to sleep around 11 pm and woke up 30 mins later to=\r\n find a small beggar-like boy with dishevelled brown hair looking at me...m=\r\ny first reaction was of fright and fear and I shouted &quot;shoo!&quot;. When shoutin=\r\ng, I closed my eyes momentarily and when I opened them, the &#39;boy&#39; was gone.=\r\n I felt a great wave of sadness engulfing me and thought that the deity (wh=\r\noever it be)had come to test me and I failed the test. Weird to say but my =\r\nwife didnt stir during the whole episode despite me shaking her and my moth=\r\ner didnt hear any noise from my bedroom...am left wondering if I hallucinat=\r\ned...dont know what to do now.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Manish: &quot;No, it was not a deity, more=\r\n likely the spirit causing the problems.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Member: &quot;eeks! now I am fri=\r\nghtened...tell me what I should do?&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; Manish: &quot;Why would you be fright=\r\nened?, they are just like you, only thoda different. If you saw a child on =\r\nthe road like this how would you behave? With compassion, I hope.\n&gt; Be like=\r\n Bholenath, He says, to all the bhoot, pretas, pisachas, &quot;My children, I kn=\r\now nobody wants you anymore, just sit with Me, nobody will trouble you here=\r\n.&quot;\n&gt; Be compassionate, nothing in this Universe can touch you unless your o=\r\nwn karmas give it the license to do so.&quot;\n&gt;  \n&gt; [Glossary: thoda =3D a littl=\r\ne, Bholenath =3D Lord Shiva, bhoot, pretas, pisachas =3D different kinds of=\r\n spirits]\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------\n&gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotis=\r\nh Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Ho=\r\nmam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;=\r\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt;      Spiri=\r\ntuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;   Jyotish writings: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- &quot;n_shashi@...&quot; &lt;n_shashi=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Recently I happened to see a few &#39;Paranor=\r\nmal State&#39; episodes and observed that the so called entities/beings identif=\r\nied or located are left alone mostly even when there is priest around.\n&gt; &gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; This brought to my mind a similar incident which i remember vaguely of =\r\nhaving read long time back in one of &#39;Ramakrishna&#39; books (dont remember the=\r\n name), where Ramakrishna and Rakhal was one day staying late at Gopaler Ma=\r\n&#39;s place and in the night Sri Ramakrisha was visited by some entity/being i=\r\nn a sad state who came to him and requested him to leave the place as Sri R=\r\namakrishna&#39;s presence was making the entity/being miserable. Ramakrishna im=\r\nmediately woke up Rakhal and left the place, avoiding giving any reasons to=\r\n people in the house.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Gopalers Ma was somebody who was immersed in =\r\ngod and still had such entities/beings around?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Also brings the ques=\r\ntion why is it that the entities/beings in sad state left alone by psychics=\r\n and spiritual persons without doing anything for their upliftment?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Is it that such beings/entities cannot be helped or is it just wise to lea=\r\nve them alone if they do not want to be disturbed?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Is their any Ved=\r\nic explanations/suggestions on such situations as above?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best Regar=\r\nds\n&gt; &gt; Shashi\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
