It is indeed one of =\r\nthe cornerstones of Sanskrit that a consonant cannot exist by itself and it=\r\ns life is given by the Vowel. But for whatever reason in Hindi they mostly =\r\navoid ending vowels. They carry that habit to other languages as well and r=\r\necently I heard one of the North Indian bhajan singers (I don&#39;t know the na=\r\nme) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bhaja Govindam as &quot;Bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, =\r\nbhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, which sounded quite odd to me! And they take th=\r\nat approach to languages like Braj Bhasha and Avadhi as well. For instance,=\r\n for them &quot;Ramacharita Manasa&quot; is more important than even Valmiki&#39;s Ramaya=\r\nna. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also without proper vowel endings. However, I=\r\n have a strong feeling that, that approach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowp=\r\nai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana\n&gt; Saroja\n&gt; &gt; &gt; raja&quot; should be pronounced exactly =\r\nlike that and not like &quot;Sri Gurucharan saroj raj&quot;.

It is the nature of Kali yuga to corrupt everything.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It is my feeling that many people, including highly learned Vedi=\r\nc scholars, pronounce some sounds in Sanskrit mantras (including Veda mantr=\r\nas) incorrectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Of course, pronunciation is not everythin=\r\ng. Having devotion and the spirit of surrender to god is even more importan=\r\nt. However, pronunciation is a factor too. Especially, correct pronunciatio=\r\nn is very important in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Veda mantra c=\r\nan stop one from the most complete experience of the mantra. In fact, we ha=\r\nve a lot of people who can memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but very few w=\r\nho can actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the next few m=\r\nonths, I will write my views on correct pronunciation and point out some co=\r\nmmon errors. If you do not think that correct pronunciation is important or=\r\n if you disagree with my assessment of the errors or if you do not want to =\r\nchange your pronunciation, please ignore my writings on this subject. On th=\r\ne other hand, if you are open to changing your pronunciation, please give a=\r\n consideration to my views and adopt my suggestions if you find them approp=\r\nriate.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Take the &quot;t&quot; sound at the en=\r\nd of the words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purastaat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Mos=\r\nt priests and scholars pronounce this sound incorrectly. They change &quot;t&quot; to=\r\n something like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is a reason why this =\r\ncorruption came into practice, but it is a corruption nevertheless.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/akshar=\r\na. If you change it into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowel sound at the=\r\n end, it becomes two aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas, chang=\r\nes the chhandas and changes the meaning also. You may still experience some=\r\nthing when meditating on the mantra, but you will never experience the mant=\r\nra to the fullest with that pronunciation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Akshara means &quot;=\r\nunperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an akshara. If =\r\nyou have just a consonant without a vowel after it, then it has no praana. =\r\nIt is kshara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if you pronounce=\r\n &quot;t&quot; as is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound =\r\nand the listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. It has no lif=\r\ne force.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one =\r\nakshara. Because &quot;t&quot; has no praana by itself, it simply joins to the akshar=\r\na &quot;yaa&quot; (which has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its praana) and becomes part of that a=\r\nkshara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered one letter (one guru). When you p=\r\nronounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is difficult for the listener to know for sur=\r\ne whether you said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one listen=\r\ns carefully, but otherwise difficult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick an=\r\nd abrupt transient sound without praana. So it tough to hear clearly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This makes people add some vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; =\r\nor &quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in between them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound get=\r\ns a praana and becomes clearly audible. It suddenly becomes an akshara and =\r\nthe chhandas changes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Probably, some big teacher started p=\r\nronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itself and become=\r\ns very clear to hear, so that his students would not get confused when lear=\r\nning. Probably the students thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaa=\r\nt&quot;) and got used to that mis-pronunciation. Probably, that became a standar=\r\nd practice after a couple of centuries.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you pronounce t=\r\nhe English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not change it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at=\r\n the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant and leave it there. You don&#39;t force an vo=\r\nwel sound to be added at the end. The same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachoda=\r\nyaat&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I said about words endi=\r\nng in consonants applies to all consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is =\r\nmore commonly encountered. There can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc al=\r\nso. There also, people normally add an artificial vowel sound at the end an=\r\nd end up changing the chhandas and altering the flow of energy in the mantr=\r\na. That is also wrong.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One more com=\r\nmon mistake is the sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story). Most south India=\r\nns pronounce this as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In Telugu and Kannada=\r\n scripts, the symbols of tha and dha looks very similar and just one dot in=\r\n the middle is different. It is possible that some people started mispronou=\r\nncing this sound because of their inability to see the dot and others start=\r\ned following. Now pronouncing tha as dha became mainstream and one pronounc=\r\ning correctly will be the odd person out.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is not =\r\nEnglish. We never have two different symbols for the same sound or two diff=\r\nerent sounds for the same symbol. The letters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different=\r\n and their sounds are different too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body o=\r\nr &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with a stress/aspiration to get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot;=\r\n =3D story).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the sankalpa before many poojas, people sa=\r\ny &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This me=\r\nans &quot;for attaining the purusharthas (purposes of human existence) - dharma =\r\n(fulfilling duties), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfilling desires) and=\r\n moksha (developing detachment)&quot;. Most people end up pronouncing &quot;dharmaart=\r\nha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;half of dharma, k=\r\naama and moksha&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaar=\r\ndha&quot; means &quot;half a human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in this sankalpa is a bad mist=\r\nake and I have seen it committed by many many trained priests!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; When you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to th=\r\ne difference between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them differentl=\r\ny. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay extra attention to ensure=\r\n that you are not confusing tha for dha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; There are several other mistakes (in my view) commonly made by most p=\r\neople in the pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I will be pointing them out=\r\n slowly in the next few months, whenever the Mother allows me to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Please give me your consideration and take my input into considerat=\r\nion in altering your pronunciation (if you are open to that). If you don&#39;t =\r\nfind any sense in what I am saying or want to continue as taught by your gu=\r\nrus, I can understand that. I am not here to change everybody&#39;s pronunciati=\r\non.

However, I have noticed that most of the tamilians have the habit of writ=\r\ning it as &quot;Ganapathi&quot; leaving one wonder if it is the word like &quot;katha&quot;.

I hope I made it clear now. &lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Similarly, the sound&nbsp;for &quot;S&quot; is i three f=\r\norms, s for softer &quot;S&quot; like lin rasa, prAsa etc. S for middle &quot;S&quot; like in S=\r\nree, maa Saarada, lord Siva, Sambhu, SaSi and so on, &quot;sh&quot; for words like Sh=\r\nat - (Six), Shanmukha and so on.

It is indeed one of the cornerstones of Sanskrit that a con=\r\nsonant cannot exist by itself and its life is given by\n the Vowel. But for =\r\nwhatever reason in Hindi they mostly avoid ending vowels. They carry that h=\r\nabit to other languages as well and recently I heard one of the North India=\r\nn bhajan singers (I don&#39;t know the name) singing Adi Sankara&#39;s Bhaja Govind=\r\nam as &quot;Bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, bhaj govindam, moodh matE&quot;, which soun=\r\nded quite odd to me! And they take that approach to languages like Braj Bha=\r\nsha and Avadhi as well. For instance, for them &quot;Ramacharita Manasa&quot; is more=\r\n important than even Valmiki&#39;s Ramayana. Yet they pronounce Avadhi also wit=\r\nhout proper vowel endings. However, I have a strong feeling that, that appr=\r\noach is incorrect. In avadhi, a chowpai like &quot;Sri Gurucharana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Saroj=\r\na&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; raja&quot; should be pronounced exactly like that and not li=\r\nke &quot;Sri Gurucharan saroj raj&quot;.

Having devotion and the spirit\n of surrender to god is even mo=\r\nre important. However, pronunciation is a factor too. Especially, correct p=\r\nronunciation is very important in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Ve=\r\nda mantra can stop one from the most complete experience of the mantra. In =\r\nfact, we have a lot of people who can memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but=\r\n very few who can actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Over the next few months, I will write my views on co=\r\nrrect pronunciation and point out some common errors. If you do not think t=\r\nhat correct pronunciation is important or if you disagree with my assessmen=\r\nt of the errors or if you do not want to change your pronunciation, please =\r\nignore my writings on this subject. On the other hand, if you are open to c=\r\nhanging your pronunciation, please give a consideration to my views and ado=\r\npt my suggestions if you find them appropriate.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; T=\r\nake the &quot;t&quot; sound at the end of the words like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava purasta=\r\nat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests and scholars pronounce this sound inco=\r\nrrectly. They change &quot;t&quot; to something like &quot;tu&quot; or &quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. =\r\nThere is a reason why this corruption came into practice, but it is a corru=\r\nption nevertheless.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;prac=\r\nhodayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/akshara. If you change i=\r\nt into &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowel sound at the end, it becomes t=\r\nwo aksharas. This increases the number of aksharas, changes the chhandas an=\r\nd changes the meaning also. You may still experience something when meditat=\r\ning on the mantra, but you will never experience the mantra to the fullest =\r\nwith that pronunciation.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Aks=\r\nhara means &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras) are the praana (life force) of an =\r\nakshara. If you have just a\n consonant without a vowel after it, then it ha=\r\ns no praana. It is kshara and NOT an akshara. It perishes. For example, if =\r\nyou pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (without adding any sounds to it), you cannot susta=\r\nin the sound and the listener cannot decipher what exactly you pronounced. =\r\nIt has no life force.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In &quot;pr=\r\nachodayaat&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Because &quot;t&quot; has no praa=\r\nna by itself, it simply joins to the akshara &quot;yaa&quot; (which has the vowel &quot;aa=\r\n&quot; as its praana) and becomes part of that akshara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is c=\r\nonsidered one letter (one guru). When you pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is=\r\n difficult for the listener to know for sure whether you said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;ya=\r\nak&quot; or &quot;yaan&quot;. It is possible if one listens carefully, but otherwise diffi=\r\ncult. The &quot;t&quot; at the end is a very quick and abrupt transient sound without=\r\n praana. So it tough to hear clearly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; This makes\n people add some vowel to it (like &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; o=\r\nr &quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in between them) so that the &quot;t&quot; sound gets=\r\n a praana and becomes clearly audible. It suddenly becomes an akshara and t=\r\nhe chhandas changes.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Probabl=\r\ny, some big teacher started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so that &quot;t&quot; gets =\r\na praana of itself and becomes very clear to hear, so that his students wou=\r\nld not get confused when learning. Probably the students thought the mantra=\r\n was &quot;yaatu&quot; (instead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got used to that mis-pronunciation. Pr=\r\nobably, that became a standard practice after a couple of centuries.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you pronounce the English word =\r\n&quot;path&quot;, you do not change it to &quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at the end of &quot;pat=\r\nh&quot; as a consonant and leave it there. You don&#39;t force an vowel sound to be =\r\nadded at the end. The same thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachodayaat&quot;.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; What I said about words ending in consonants applies to al=\r\nl consonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more commonly encountered. The=\r\nre can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. There also, people normall=\r\ny add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end up changing the chhandas=\r\n and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. That is also wrong.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One more common mistake is the sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa=\r\n&quot; =3D story). Most south Indians pronounce this as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D=\r\n money). In Telugu and Kannada scripts, the symbols of tha and dha looks ve=\r\nry similar and just one dot in the middle is different. It is possible that=\r\n some people started mispronouncing this sound because of their inability t=\r\no see the dot and others started following. Now pronouncing tha as dha beca=\r\nme\n mainstream and one pronouncing correctly will be the odd person out.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sanskrit is not English. We ne=\r\nver have two different symbols for the same sound or two different sounds f=\r\nor the same symbol. The letters &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different and their sou=\r\nnds are different too. Pronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D=\r\n copper) with a stress/aspiration to get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In the sankalpa before many p=\r\noojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha chaturvidha purushaartha siddhy=\r\nartham&quot;. This means &quot;for attaining the purusharthas (purposes of human exis=\r\ntence) - dharma (fulfilling duties), artha (work and money), kaama (fulfill=\r\ning desires) and moksha (developing detachment)&quot;. Most people end up pronou=\r\nncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha kaama moksha&quot;. It means &quot;h=\r\nalf of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; means &quot;half attainment=\r\n&quot;\n and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a human&quot;. Mis-pronunciation in this sanka=\r\nlpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it committed by many many trained prie=\r\nsts!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When you read Vaidika/T=\r\naantrika/Pouranika mantras, pay attention to the difference between &quot;tha&quot; a=\r\nnd &quot;dha&quot; and learn to pronounce them differently. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dh=\r\na&quot; in the mantra, pay extra attention to ensure that you are not confusing =\r\ntha for dha.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There are several other mistakes (in =\r\nmy view) commonly made by most people in the pronunciation of Sanskrit mant=\r\nras. I will be pointing them out slowly in the next few months, whenever th=\r\ne Mother allows me to.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pleas=\r\ne give me your consideration and take my input into consideration in alteri=\r\nng your pronunciation (if you are open to that). If you don&#39;t find any\n sen=\r\nse in what I am saying or want to continue as taught by your gurus, I can u=\r\nnderstand that. I am not here to change everybody&#39;s pronunciation. But, bec=\r\nause She inspired me to share my thoughts with the world, I am guessing tha=\r\nt there are SOME who are destined to change their pronunciation based on my=\r\n views. That is why I am writing these mails.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If you do not like this discussion, I am sorry and just i=\r\ngnore this idiot!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regar=\r\nds,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Ganap=\r\nathi Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollow\n target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ve=\r\ndic-wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=\r\n=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;htt=\r\np://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow=\r\n target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/=\r\n&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;\r\n--0-763477239-1302391561=:61562--\r\n\n"}}
