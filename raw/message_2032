But, to me, the most i=\r\nntriguing aspect of Vimalananda&#39;s assertion that the rishis created the god=\r\ns is &quot;how&quot; he could say it. The answer seems to be that he could say anythi=\r\nng, in that he was protected by Smashan Tara. Vimalananda, if he existed, c=\r\name very close to living in a state beyond fear, and in a constant state of=\r\n ecstasy, having removed bodily suffering by directly challenging it. The s=\r\nexual excitement of suffering, call it kundalini or whatever, seemed to be =\r\nthe key to this passion for life. The mind, the rishis, the Godhead are all=\r\n ultimately the play of shakti. The Yakshini who follows him and says &quot;Mai =\r\nAaun&quot; is his ego&#39;s own projection of a limited shakti, the temptation or pl=\r\nay of his own mind, which threatens destruction. The yakshini is his own do=\r\nubt about the mother, and he can&#39;t live with this doubt, the fear that the =\r\nmother will harm him. He had to ask one of his gurus to finally take the ya=\r\nkshini away\n because he didn&#39;t want to be bothered and he didn&#39;t believe he=\r\n had the power to remove her himself. Vimalananda had such devotion to the =\r\nmother that he did not have to fear, because he knew that he would return t=\r\no the mother and that all of this earthly life was mere play. When he goes =\r\nto the smashan and leaves his new wife in the car, she gets scared and pass=\r\nes out because of the miracle of union with shakti that Vimalananda has ach=\r\nieved. When the male does not resist the feminine force, there are no more =\r\negoic demons for Kali to destroy. She passes out, unconscious. At that poin=\r\nt, Vimalananda was at the top of his game. He was beyond fear. It is only i=\r\nn moments of weakness that Shiva would need Vishnu or vice versa, moments o=\r\nf fatigue, like passing the baton in a race or tag teaming in wrestling: th=\r\ne duality of on/off. The rishi&#39;s mind cannot sustain any one state, so he c=\r\nreates many gods. He can&#39;t abide in shakti all the time, so he manifests hi=\r\ns own\n ego as Vishnu or Shiva in order to preserve or destroy manifestation=\r\ns of shakti, thoughts of his own mind which either please or disturb him. T=\r\nhe myth of the ever burning light, (like Byron the Bulb in &quot;Gravity&#39;s Rainb=\r\now&quot;) is an example of the unattainable. It is the shakti which the rishi kn=\r\nows is there only when he thinks about it, but he cannot think about it or =\r\nexperience it all the time. If he could tune all chakras to this shakti at =\r\nall times that would be perfect tantra. He must, however, create the manife=\r\nstation of shakti, or the mother, to rescue him from any type of mental or =\r\nphysical difficulty, or backwater of consciousness which he encounters. The=\r\n Yakshini is only his death if he needs death, but his mother if he needs l=\r\nife. If he can&#39;t take the backwater anymore he will sacrifice his sexual en=\r\nergy to the yakshini and have done with life. But if he sees her as mother =\r\nhe will live. Ultimately he would like to see her as Shiva saw Parvati. If\n=\r\n he can hold this latter state he has reached perfect tantra.\n=C2=A0\nThanks=\r\n,\n=C2=A0\nJeff Berger\n\n--- On Tue, 6/23/09, Narasimha P.V.R.

As per Narayana sooktam, all gods (including Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, In=\r\ndra etc) came from Narayana. As per Ganapathi Atharva seersham, all gods (i=\r\nncluding Brahma, Vishnu, Shiva, Indra etc) came from Ganapathi.

And so on.\n=C2=A0\nThe duality is =\r\nso vast and yet non-duality is the underlying supreme reality in duality. T=\r\nhus, the hierarchy within hierarchy will have to start at the connection wi=\r\nth non-duality and it is not one. In other words, any hierarchy given by an=\r\nyone is with respect to one perspective. I will not be too keen on finalizi=\r\nng one hierarchy, because that cannot be done really.

Also, he need not be talking about somebody &quot;connected=\r\n to&quot; his ashram. Moreover, when it comes to great lineages, there are conne=\r\nctions between all.

He had a vision in his prison cell of Swami =\r\nVivekananda, just=C2=A0a few years after his death, in which he imparted Au=\r\nrobindo some key knowledge.

An=\r\nd so on.\n=C2=A0\nComing back to the main point, the supermind established in=\r\n the field of earth that was referred to by Aurobindo can simply be a mahar=\r\nshi paying some attention to matters on earth. A maharshi absorbed in the d=\r\nivine in one of the higher planes of consciousness can accomplish huge chan=\r\nges on earth by the mere power of his thought. If there is a divine play to=\r\n make some positive changes on earth and a maharshi takes part in the play,=\r\n he may focus a small part of his supermind on the affairs of earth and dir=\r\nect a few important souls to do some key work.=C2=A0Some important souls (d=\r\neities, rishis or yogis etc) may send their amshas (partial essence) to be =\r\nborn on earth to fulfil different parts of a divine play.\n=C2=A0\nYou may th=\r\nen see several (not just one) elevated beings, enlightened beings and reali=\r\nzed beings born on earth to bring clarity in different aspects of spiritual=\r\n knowledge.

I am posting i=\r\nt here for anyone interested.\n=C2=A0\nNear the beginning of the 20th century=\r\n the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, began to ex=\r\npress a truth which had not been expressed before. In his high states of di=\r\nvine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in the evolution o=\r\nf mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right here on Earth and t=\r\nhat the time for this divine emergence into Earth life was now. He spoke of=\r\n heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown due to t=\r\nhe intrinsic resistance held within her material body towards this =EF=BF=\r\n=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n=EF=BF=BD\nSri Aurobindo was joined in Pondicherry, Ind=\r\nia, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known as the Mother=\r\n. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive cellular transformation =\r\nthat is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties we face today.\n=EF=BF=\r\n=BD\nSri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all matter, and that =\r\nall matter therefore has a force of consciousness. The process of the divin=\r\ne spirit descending down into matter is called involution. The process by w=\r\nhich the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is called evolution. Acc=\r\nording to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage where these two event=\r\ns are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, he foresaw that w=\r\ne would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =EF=BF=BDsuprament=\r\nal (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirely change everythin=\r\ng on Earth.\n=EF=BF=BD\nMan=EF=BF=BDs greatness is not in what he is, says Sr=\r\ni Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immortal soul is somewhere w=\r\nithin him, even if seldom active in most people, while an eternal spirit ov=\r\nershadows him, even if obstructed from descent by the hard lid of his const=\r\nructed personality. There is a great divine plan in motion, even if the evi=\r\ndence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.\n\nSri Aurobindo recognized=\r\n that humankind is going through an evolutionary crisis. A stage has been r=\r\neached in which the human mind has made tremendous strides on the one hand,=\r\n but is left hopelessly inadequate to prevent its own extinction as a speci=\r\nes. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified before her death in 1973, a consciou=\r\nsness higher than the human rational mind, what may be termed the Supermind=\r\n, has recently been established in the fields of the Earth, and is active t=\r\nhere. Our task now is to bring it down into cellular consciousness.\n\nEvolut=\r\nion took a great leap forward with the origins of Life, and later with the =\r\nemergence of Mind. We are now at the threshold of another leap forward, eve=\r\nn more momentous, as we prepare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aur=\r\nobindo speaks about four stages of human evolution, which we will soon be s=\r\ntarting to experience concurrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal=\r\n human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a rational being possessing an indivi=\r\ndualized soul, but largely obstructed from contacting and merging with it.\n=\r\n=EF=BF=BD\nNext is the =EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spon=\r\ntaneous- ly coming to birth under the influence of an ever-expanding supram=\r\nental field, a being that is largely able to merge and live from soul-consc=\r\niousness rather than mind-consciousness. \n=C2=A0\nThirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOv=\r\nerman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a dense physical body, but will be i=\r\nn possession of the Mind of Light, which is supramental consciousness that =\r\nhas begun to merge with cellular consciousness. \n=C2=A0\nFinally, our ultima=\r\nte goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity i=\r\nncarnated fully within the subtle realms of matter. This will be a race of =\r\nwhat we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, th=\r\ne unity of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon Earth.\n\nThe great=\r\n work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in bringing supramental conscious=\r\nness down into the cellular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this i=\r\ns a unified consciousness, this meant that the supramental consciousness wa=\r\ns simultaneously being brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, =\r\nawaiting the moment when it would flower into its full manifestation in col=\r\nlective matter.\nWhenever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corr=\r\nesponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their experienc=\r\ne with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, a=\r\nt work in the world today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suf=\r\nfering, The Asura of Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the force=\r\ns that are so outwardly apparent, and which seem to be in control of curren=\r\nt global events. According to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gon=\r\ne through a transformation recently, and the Asura of Suffering has returne=\r\nd to Source, and so only the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on Eart=\r\nh. Interestingly, they spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=\r\n=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World War II, and of their own intensive in=\r\nner work in countering his influence. It would not be difficult to see how =\r\nthis same Asura may be influencing other world leaders in the current polit=\r\nical sphere.\n\nWith the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our =\r\nold obsolete human structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo em=\r\nphasized that although the changes will be enormous they would not be neces=\r\nsarily catastrophic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and=\r\n our world for the most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, h=\r\ne maintained, carried a power of harmonization which could overcome this re=\r\nsistance by means other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras wil=\r\nl eventually be absorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Bea=\r\nuty, and Truth. It may be interesting to speculate, with all the violence i=\r\nn the world today, the destruction we might have experienced if not for thi=\r\ns power of harmonization!\n\nWhen does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the=\r\n Mother believed that the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and=\r\n that it was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental t=\r\nransformation was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a mini=\r\nmum of destruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=\r\n=EF=BF=BD She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.\n=C2=A0\nThis=\r\n was a very interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji says about change=\r\ns coming in the world.\n=C2=A0\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n=C2=A0\n\nThe upsurge (=\r\nof consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-321901077-1245827474=:12892\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV&gt;Jai Santoshi Ma,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;This is a compelling thread. But, to me, the most intriguing aspect o=\r\nf Vimalananda&#39;s assertion that the rishis created the gods is &quot;how&quot; he coul=\r\nd say it. The answer seems to be that he could say anything, in that he was=\r\n protected by Smashan Tara. Vimalananda, if he existed, came very close to =\r\nliving in a state beyond fear, and in a constant state of ecstasy, having r=\r\nemoved bodily suffering by directly challenging it. The sexual excitement o=\r\nf suffering, call it kundalini or whatever, seemed to be the key to this pa=\r\nssion for life. The mind, the rishis, the Godhead are all ultimately the pl=\r\nay of shakti. The Yakshini who follows him and says &quot;Mai Aaun&quot; is his ego&#39;s=\r\n own projection of a limited shakti, the temptation or play of his own mind=\r\n, which threatens destruction. The yakshini is his own doubt about the moth=\r\ner, and he can&#39;t live with this doubt, the fear that the mother will harm h=\r\nim. He had to ask one of his gurus to finally take the yakshini away\n becau=\r\nse he didn&#39;t want to be bothered and he didn&#39;t believe he had the power to =\r\nremove her himself. Vimalananda had such devotion to the mother that he did=\r\n not have to fear, because he knew that he would return to the mother and t=\r\nhat all of this earthly life was mere play. When he goes to the smashan and=\r\n leaves his new wife in the car, she gets scared and passes out because of =\r\nthe miracle of union with shakti that Vimalananda has achieved. When the ma=\r\nle does not resist the feminine force, there are no more egoic demons for K=\r\nali to destroy. She passes out, unconscious. At that point, Vimalananda was=\r\n at the top of his game. He was beyond fear. It is only in moments of weakn=\r\ness that Shiva would need Vishnu or vice versa, moments of fatigue, like pa=\r\nssing the baton in a race or tag teaming in wrestling: the duality of on/of=\r\nf. The rishi&#39;s mind cannot sustain any one state, so he creates many gods. =\r\nHe can&#39;t abide in shakti all the time, so he manifests his own\n ego as Vish=\r\nnu or Shiva in order to preserve or destroy manifestations of shakti, thoug=\r\nhts of his own mind which either please or disturb him. The myth of the eve=\r\nr burning light, (like Byron the Bulb in &quot;Gravity&#39;s Rainbow&quot;) is an example=\r\n of the unattainable. It is the shakti which the rishi knows is there only =\r\nwhen he thinks about it, but he cannot think about it or experience it all =\r\nthe time. If he could tune all chakras to this shakti at all times that wou=\r\nld be perfect tantra. He must, however, create the manifestation of shakti,=\r\n or the mother, to rescue him from any type of mental or physical difficult=\r\ny, or backwater of consciousness which he encounters. The Yakshini is only =\r\nhis death if he needs death, but his mother if he needs life. If he can&#39;t t=\r\nake the backwater anymore he will sacrifice his sexual energy to the yakshi=\r\nni and have done with life. But if he sees her as mother he will live. Ulti=\r\nmately he would like to see her as Shiva saw Parvati. If\n he can hold this =\r\nlatter state he has reached perfect tantra.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Th=\r\nanks,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Jeff Berger&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Tue, 6/23/0=\r\n9, Narasimha P.V.R.

I am posting it here for anyone interested.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fa=\r\nce=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Near the beginning of the 20th=\r\n century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Aurobindo, beg=\r\nan to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In his high stat=\r\nes of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stage in the evo=\r\nlution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right here on Ear=\r\nth and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life was now. He =\r\nspoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced a breakdown =\r\ndue to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body towards this =\r\n=EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Sri Aurobindo was joined in Pond=\r\nicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later became known a=\r\ns the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive cellular tra=\r\nnsformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties we face tod=\r\nay.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeates all m=\r\natter, and that all matter therefore has a force of\n consciousness. The pro=\r\ncess of the divine spirit descending down into matter is called involution.=\r\n The process by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter is call=\r\ned evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a stage wher=\r\ne these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner visions, =\r\nhe foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he called =\r\n=EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would entirel=\r\ny change everything on Earth.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness is no=\r\nt in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An immo=\r\nrtal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people, wh=\r\nile an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent by t=\r\nhe hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a great divine plan in=\r\n motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict it.&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going through an evolut=\r\nionary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the human mind has made tr=\r\nemendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to prev=\r\nent its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified bef=\r\nore her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind,=\r\n what may be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the fie=\r\nlds of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down int=\r\no cellular consciousness.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Evolution took a great leap forwar=\r\nd with the origins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We are no=\r\nw at the threshold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as we prep=\r\nare for the emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four sta=\r\nges of human evolution, which we will soon be starting to experience concur=\r\nrently upon Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current=\r\n species, a rational being possessing an individualized soul, but largely o=\r\nbstructed from contacting and merging with it.&lt;BR&gt;=EF=BF=BD&lt;BR&gt;Next is the =\r\n=EF=BF=BDhuman human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to =\r\nbirth under the influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being t=\r\nhat is largely able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than m=\r\nind-consciousness. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still inhabit a=\r\n dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Light, which=\r\n is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellular conscio=\r\nusness. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Fi=\r\nnally, our ultimate goal as a species is the =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=\r\n=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the subtle realms of matter. This w=\r\nill be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In=\r\n this species, the unity of matter and spirit would be fully realized upon =\r\nEarth.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;The great work of Sri Aurobindo and the Mother was in=\r\n bringing supramental consciousness down into the cellular consciousness of=\r\n their own bodies. Since this is a unified consciousness, this meant that t=\r\nhe supramental consciousness was simultaneously being brought into the cons=\r\nciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment when it would flower int=\r\no its full manifestation in collective matter.&lt;BR&gt;Whenever there is a =EF=\r\n=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistance. Sri Aurobindo and=\r\n the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=\r\n=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world today. There is th=\r\ne Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura of Falsehood, and th=\r\ne Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwardly apparent, and =\r\nwhich seem to be in control of current global events. According to them the=\r\n Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transformation recently, a=\r\nnd the Asura of Suffering has\n returned to Source, and so only the latter t=\r\nwo still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, they spoke of the A=\r\nsura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hitler during World =\r\nWar II, and of their own intensive inner work in countering his influence. =\r\nIt would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may be influencing oth=\r\ner world leaders in the current political sphere.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;With the d=\r\nescent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete human struc=\r\ntures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that although t=\r\nhe changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrophic. The=\r\n power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for the most =\r\npart consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, carried a =\r\npower of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by means other =\r\nthan dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be absorbed=\r\n into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. It may b=\r\ne interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world today, the d=\r\nestruction we might have experienced if not for this power of harmonization=\r\n!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother=\r\n believed that the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and that i=\r\nt was quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transfor=\r\nmation was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a minimum of =\r\ndestruction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD=\r\n She said that the year 2000 would be a turning point.&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/=\r\nU&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;This was a very interesting read and matches what Naras=\r\nimhaji says about changes coming in the world.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;-Regards&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV class=3DMsoNormal&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE: 10pt; COLOR: navy; F=\r\nONT-FAMILY: Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DCourier color=3D#000000 size=3D3&gt;&lt;FONT co=\r\nlor=3D#00007f&gt;The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava&lt;/FONT&gt; &lt;/FONT&gt;- Sh=\r\niva Sutra&lt;/SPAN&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/EM&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABL=\r\nE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQ=\r\nUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-321901077-1245827474=:12892--\r\n\n"}}
