Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to any \n&gt; &gt; Hanuma=\r\nn temple\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and get a mantra for lifting up the Mangal in my natal chart=\r\n \n&gt; which \n&gt; &gt; suffers\n&gt; &gt; &gt; from rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and neecha in n=\r\navamsa). When I \n&gt; &gt; visited the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha Per=\r\numal temple, Thirumazhisai \n&gt; near \n&gt; &gt; Chennai\n&gt; &gt; &gt; and asked the priest =\r\nabout a mantra, he advised me to chant the \n&gt; &gt; mantra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; inscribed on t=\r\nhe walls of the temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya \njaya \n&gt; &gt; ram| which\n&gt; &gt; &gt; c=\r\nomes out to be a 7 word, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy from the \n7th \n&gt; &gt; hous=\r\ne to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the 10th house with the mantra devata sitting in lagna as per \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; mantra shastra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; teachings. I&#39;ve been doing this every evening since=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Later I came to know this is the Rama taraka mantra. My \nque=\r\nstion \n&gt; is \n&gt; &gt; how does\n&gt; &gt; &gt; this mantra help to counter the rajabhanga =\r\nof Mangal?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly what is the correct form of the Rama tarak=\r\na mantra?
