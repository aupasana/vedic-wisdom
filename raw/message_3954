So this lifetime he has to pay back. \n\nThe gist is f=\r\nake gurus were present even in Lord Ramas time too.\nPlease pardon if there =\r\nare some inaccuracies in the description of the story, for accuracy I recom=\r\nmend others to read the chapter in ramayana.\n\nWe donot hear more as no one =\r\nwrote about it. We do see a lot now a days as we now live in internet age, =\r\nboth good and bad news travel fast.\n\nOn a different perspective, there is a=\r\nlso need for guidance and help for those masses who are not uttama sishyas,=\r\n and so since the time we live in and the time to come are different from t=\r\nhe last 1000 years or the last 9000 years, I hope that god or guru shakti w=\r\nill manifest in a different way that is more effective to the time and the =\r\ntype and state of sadhakas that is going to come.\n\nIt is the law of nature =\r\nwhere we see birth and then growth and then like a lamp towards the end the=\r\n lamp shines very brightly and then the light in the lamp goes out. In a si=\r\nmilar way in the past we have seen birth, growth, and then disappearance of=\r\n  many sects and spiritaul practices, we will see new ones coming out to su=\r\nit more to the time.\n\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.c=\r\nom, &quot;S&quot; &lt;tejomaya101@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt;               =\r\n    I have to &#39;disagree&#39; with you here. The fact is that the uttama Guru ap=\r\npears to sadhakas of the same stature. In the present times, there is a sho=\r\nrtage of such people. There are fewer uttama sishya and hence there is a sh=\r\nortage of uttama Gurus. \n&gt; \n&gt; Again it is nothing new to say that God must =\r\nbe the Guru. This is how it has been and will be. Like the sastras say - Gu=\r\nru, mantra and devatha are one and there should be no difference seen betwe=\r\nen them. In the same way, the sastra say that the one who considers the phy=\r\nsical being his Guru is not destined to succeed. \n&gt; \n&gt; Even today if a utta=\r\nma Guru is born, He/She may want to attract only the uttama sishya and not =\r\nan adhama sishya. Unless one is that sishya, one will always see a million =\r\ndefects in ones Guru- EVEN if he is a maha-siddha. The fault is in the view=\r\ner. What to say of Guru, one can find fault in Devatha as well. The problem=\r\n is not with the Guru/Devatha, but with the viewer/sadhaka who is still sub=\r\nject to his/her own conditioning and the accumulated results of sins acting=\r\n on him/her. The Guru as well as the Devatha are eternal and our own limite=\r\nd personalities are not. The &#39;dress&#39; the Guru wears ( His/Her own limited p=\r\nersonality which He/She has mostly overcome) is also not permanent. This is=\r\n why the tantras say that Guru vakya is often more powerful than the Guru.T=\r\nhe vakya comes from the Devatha in the form of the Guru. \n&gt; \n&gt; The very fac=\r\nt that various tantras spend time in explaining Guru lakshanam and sishya l=\r\nakshanam is very revealing about how things have been for the past few 1000=\r\n years at least.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Guru as well as the devatha are never external.  =\r\n              Our entire sadhana lies in realisation of this fact. \n&gt; \n&gt; Pe=\r\nople are led by their own karma to false Gurus. There is little need to loo=\r\nk at false Gurus and despair(may be not you, but as many people are wont to=\r\n). This is like looking at a bad husband or cheating wife and believing tha=\r\nt all husbands or wives are like that.\n&gt; \n&gt; There were very clear indicatio=\r\nns about someone like Nityananda( whom I dont condemn for the particular as=\r\npect of having been unable to over come his human weakness) being not a fit=\r\n Guru. \n&gt; \n&gt; IMHO a sadhaka needs to be an example of how things or people =\r\ncould be in this world and provide an inspiration and a counter current eve=\r\nn when things outside seem to be falling to bits.\n&gt; \n&gt; My apologies if I ha=\r\nve spoken any nonsense or caused any offense.I may have stated the obvious =\r\nin  many different ways or alluded to things without addressing them. I do =\r\nnot say &#39;dont do any sadhana and keep searching for a Guru for ever&#39;; but I=\r\n do not agree with giving up without searching. I am sure anyone with a goo=\r\nd Guru will understand what I say. All correct things are Her grace and all=\r\n nonsense that of my limited ago.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; S\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste=\r\n Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But in the times to come, the idea of running after =\r\na guru\n&gt; &gt; &gt; will change. Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; I know one person with spiritual inclination who went on a long pilgrimag=\r\ne visiting many temples and ashrams in India. He was hoping that he would m=\r\neet a realized master who would bless him and give him a big push spiritual=\r\nly. He was an old classmate of Manish and Manish was telling him from the b=\r\neginning that he would not find anyone like that. Manish told him to just s=\r\nit at home and do intense sadhana - homam, japam etc. But still that person=\r\n wanted to go around in search of a guru who would lift him. No need to say=\r\n he did not find anyone like that.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nWe indeed had spiritual masters in the past who were capable of lifting peo=\r\nple just like that. However, such masters are rare today. In fact, Paramaha=\r\nnsa Yogananda said that great masters will no longer descend to earth in co=\r\nming years. I interpret what he said slightly differently. Some great maste=\r\nrs may still descend to earth in future, but they may not act like the sadg=\r\nurus of past. They may only show the (a) path and leave responsibility in t=\r\nhe hands of people.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Why should it be so?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The age of fak=\r\ne swamis and babas who are secretly after name and money has dawned (or wil=\r\nl soon dawn) on earth. They will pretend to be realized masters though they=\r\n are not. They will be difficult to discern. This is going to render futile=\r\n for many the search for a sadguru to whom one can completely surrender. In=\r\n the old days, if you found a sadguru, surrendered to him/her and followed =\r\nhis/her commands blindly, your life would be made and you would achieve wha=\r\ntever was meant to be achieved spiritually in that life. However, the same =\r\ncannot be said about following a fake guru blindly. In an age when there ar=\r\ne probably going to be far more fake gurus than sadgurus, isn&#39;t it advisabl=\r\ne to rewrite the blueprint of a spiritual journey? Instead of searching for=\r\n a sadguru and surrendering to him, it may be better for most seekers to ju=\r\nst do sadhana and take God or Fire as guru as Rajarshi wisely said.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; The old thinking will slowly be replaced by a new model appropriate for =\r\nthe new times. What Paramahansa Yogananda said is along the same lines. Mor=\r\ne developments in future may re-inforce the new approach.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Paramahansa Yogananda said that great masters will n=\r\not descend to earth in future. Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said that he would b=\r\ne back after about 100 years accompanied by others who accompanied him earl=\r\nier and that many people would be liberated en masse this time. How do we r=\r\neconcile?\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Quite possibly, Ramakrishna will not do any miracles or=\r\n touch people and grant them liberation just like that, but he will probabl=\r\ny show them how to find god. He will not take them to god himself, but poin=\r\nt them to a path that will lead to god. He will probably inspire many peopl=\r\ne to do intense sadhana and become liberated.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In the old days, we had brave kshatriyas who were very dharmik a=\r\nnd unselfish. It made sense to put power completely and unconditionally in =\r\ntheir hands. It worked for the benefit of all. As such kshatriyas became ra=\r\nre and world started to be dominated by adharmik and selfish seekers of pow=\r\ner, Nature adjusted the course of humanity and most of the world is today b=\r\nased on the concept of democracy or switching to it slowly.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; In sp=\r\niritual matters also, we had learned braahmanas who were very dharmik, unse=\r\nlfish and liberated. it made sense to place people&#39;s spiritual lives comple=\r\ntely and unconditionally in their hands. As such braahmanas become rare and=\r\n world starts to be dominated by adharmik and selfish possessors of knowled=\r\nge (who are still in the web of Maayaa), Nature may adjust the course of hu=\r\nmanity and redefine religion and spiritual progress based on more relevant =\r\nconcepts and ideas.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; The bottomline:=\r\n If you like a guru or his teachings, benefit from them. But do not worry a=\r\nbout finding a sadguru as given in some scriptures and just keep doing sadh=\r\nana. Surrender to god, do homam/japam etc and wait patiently. It is a more =\r\nfruitful method than to search for a sadguru who will lift you.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; B=\r\nest regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------\n&gt; &gt;   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, =\r\nJyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and P=\r\nitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;     =\r\n Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;      Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;   Jyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; ---- rajarshi nandy &lt;raja=\r\nrshi14@&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I too believe we should give =\r\nthe benefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda.

Tehelka, which did the=\r\n sting operation, is a VERY questionable organization.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 2) Sec=\r\nond, how does one know whether Swami Nityananda was not practising say some=\r\n sexual ritual?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; 3) What exactly is the big fuss if a Swami, a=\r\nnd a reasonable good one, has sex with someone?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; We live in su=\r\nch times where Mahamaya has made it almost impossible for even VERY advance=\r\nd souls to remain perfect brahmacharis from birth till death. Souls who mig=\r\nht have been brahmacharis in all previous births, would probably not be abl=\r\ne to remain so when born in thid age is a simple fact of nature, otherwise =\r\nhow else is Kali Yuga to be different from other yugas?

Our =\r\nsociety too is steeped in unnecessary prudishness and misconceptions about =\r\nlust and spirituality. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; All said and done, Vimalanada - whom =\r\nI consider to be one of the greatest Saints who lived - took 6 years of str=\r\nuggle to overcome lust.
