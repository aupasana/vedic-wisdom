what you are continousely pr=\r\nopogating - &quot;They saints, siddhas etc are\n&gt; great and special souls and we =\r\nare ordinary&quot;, stop it, it&#39;s a non sense,\n&gt; Beware !\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Try to=\r\n understand, behaving like a knower or a Guru without\n&gt; realization has alw=\r\nays been harmful to our religion and people&#39;s faith,\n&gt; Many a people find s=\r\nuch an imitation easy, this is the reason India is\n&gt; full of preachers, but=\r\n it has only a handful enlightened seekers.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; When a unrealiz=\r\ned person does acting of realized guru or authoritative\n&gt; signature on reli=\r\ngion, he propogates incorrect theories, expansion of\n&gt; such incorrect thing=\r\ns suppresses correct things and then there is a\n&gt; deterioration of dharma, =\r\nculture and value system, see, Your&#39;s interest\n&gt; in religion is ok but havi=\r\nng integrity and accountability is a must,\n&gt; when you are going to get that=\r\n ?\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; You can have bhakti, bhakti is great, be a bhakta if tha=\r\nt&#39;s desirable\n&gt; but try to have an attitude of a Bhakta not the Guru kind S=\r\nmart Bhakta\n&gt; and then you relish it but learn that the negative visdom spr=\r\nead in the\n&gt; time of Bhakti age has led india to slavery and away from Vedi=\r\nc virtues\n&gt; and values, the negative message was not spread by those great =\r\nBhaktas\n&gt; but by fake mathadhis or scholars or preachers or followers, unre=\r\nalized\n&gt; pakhandi ones, It has made people narrow minded, slefish and\n&gt; com=\r\npromising, we lost our Vedic heroism as reflected in current\n&gt;
