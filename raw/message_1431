Sri Sri Ravishankar, Rishi Prabhakar and many such known =\r\nand unknown.\nthese people (especially the first to names) advocated &#39;Kriya =\r\nYoga&#39; in a very big way. Paramhamsa Yogananada in his celebrated work &#39;The =\r\nautobiography of a yogi&#39; categorically mention that Kriya Yoga is like a Je=\r\nt Flight to reach the truth in comparision to the other methods which are l=\r\nike bullock cart. he also mentions that Kriya yoga was first taught by Kris=\r\nhna to Arjuna and then it was lost in time and was again revived by Mahaava=\r\ntar Bababji and passed on to Lahir Mahashaya and the others.\nIt is claimed =\r\nthat Sri sri Ravishankar went in to deep silence for some 8 days in the yea=\r\nr 1980 and he came out with &#39;Sudarshan Kriya Yoga&#39; for the world. he starte=\r\nd teaching that and now it is practised regularly by millions of people.\nI =\r\nknow from my abstract experiences that Kriya yoga of Babaji and Sudarshan k=\r\nriya yoga by Sri Sri are essentially same. why i say that because one day i=\r\n yearningly prayed babaji for helping me to learn Kriya yoga and within a m=\r\nonth i learnt Sudarshan kriya by AOL accidently.\n***\nThe point is that thes=\r\ne people are advocating some or the other form of Kriya yoga, Raja Yoga, Ha=\r\nthyoga etc.. for all of these initial base is external medium which is Air =\r\n(Vayu). I myself have done Sudarshan Kriya for some 2 years.\n***\nBabaji or =\r\nSri Sri or any other master (present day or ancient) have stressed on this =\r\nmedium. they actually didn&#39;t advocate Agni for the masses (Though as i said=\r\n in prevous message that some have started advocating Homa of late). it is =\r\nobvious that they may not be oblivious of the fact that Agni is more purer =\r\nmedium then air.\n\n***\nI Wish to have your views on this whole subject.\n\nyou=\r\nrs spiritually,\n\nUtpal \n\n\n\n\n\n\n"}}
