Do they work? I will give my 2=\r\n cents of views based on my experience and insights. I will be honest, stra=\r\night-forward and blunt.\n\n* * *\n\nThough believers call priests and get pooja=\r\ns done, in the hope that their problems will be solved, many priests today =\r\nare incapable of producing any results. As a result, some believers got acc=\r\nustomed to accepting that a pudding exists even without eating it and remai=\r\nn hungry throughout life. And some intelligent people stopped believing in =\r\ngod and in remedies. Let me first address why this has come to be and then =\r\ntalk about what we should do.\n\nIn ancient times, caste system was not as ri=\r\ngid as it is today. One&#39;s varna was decided based on one&#39;s aptitude. One pr=\r\nimarily interested in knowledge and spiritual progress would be a Brahmana.=\r\n One primarily interested in power, authority and control over others would=\r\n be a Kshatriya. One primarily interested in money would be a Vaisya. One p=\r\nrimarily interested in physical pleasures would be a Shudra. One would star=\r\nt off with the varna of one&#39;s father, as that is what one is exposed to in =\r\nchildhood. However, as one&#39;s vasana (mental conditioning) blooms, one would=\r\n get one&#39;s own varna. One born a Shudra like Valmiki, for example, can late=\r\nr turn into a Braahmana and become a Maharshi. One born a Kshatriya like Vi=\r\nswamitra, for example, can later turn into a Brahmana and become a Maharshi=\r\n.\n\nIn the old days, there were true Brahmanas, who would only be interested=\r\n in knowledge and spiritual progress and not caring about power, influence,=\r\n money, pleasures etc. Such Brahmanas became quite pure and accumulated eno=\r\nugh spiritual energy through continuous sadhana over years and were capable=\r\n of performing very effective poojas for people.\n\nToday, people who have sp=\r\niritual potential may be born in non-Brahmana families and not allowed to d=\r\nevelop fully due to the rigid caste structures. Some people born in Brahman=\r\na families may also end up getting into modern careers and not developing f=\r\nully as Brahmanas. Some people may be born in Brahmana families with Kshatr=\r\niya/Vaisya/ Shudra tendencies and may end up becoming priests who are inter=\r\nested in power, authority and control over others, money and physical pleas=\r\nures. Those priests who only care about knowledge and spiritual progress (i=\r\n.e. true Brahmanas) are very rare. As a result, Brahmanas who have done gen=\r\nuine sadhana and accumulated a good amount of spiritual energy are so few.\n=\r\n\n* * *\n\nIf one has one million dollars in one&#39;s bank account, a check given=\r\n by one for thousand dollars is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is empty,=\r\n what good is a thousand dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similar=\r\nly, poojas done and blessings given by a priest without enough spiritual en=\r\nergy cannot bring one any benefits.\n\nOne important note: The power is not i=\r\nn a combination of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ri=\r\ntual). The power is in the MIND that FOCUSES on a combination of syllables =\r\n(mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). Energy is generated wh=\r\nen mind overcomes its tendency to wander and instead focuses on one thing. =\r\nDifferent mantras and rituals as the focus points may generate different ki=\r\nnds of energy, but the key is focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual produc=\r\nes anything. Focus comes with a lot of practice. Most priests are just enga=\r\nging in casual practice when they go and do poojas. In the old days, priest=\r\ns did intense sadhana and brought that energy to the table when they did ri=\r\ntuals at the houses of people or in temples.\n\nI did see priests who have do=\r\nne good sadhana, purified themselves and carry some spiritual energy. But t=\r\nhose are getting rarer and rarer now-a-days. One can most certainly not ban=\r\nk on finding such a priest.\n\n* * *\n\nGiven this, one is better off not depen=\r\nding on the priest/Brahmana class for remedies. BTW, I have nothing against=\r\n the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; class, having been born in an orthodox Brahmana fa=\r\nmily myself. I have neither love nor hatred for the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; cla=\r\nss. My only wish is that more people - from any birth caste - develop into =\r\ntrue Brahmanas.\n\nInstead of a Brahmana-by- birth who is possibly proud of h=\r\nis skills and thinking about money and possibly not identifying with your t=\r\nrouble, you can do the mantra/ritual yourself. Atleast your identification =\r\nwith the trouble and your desire to solve the problem will be better than t=\r\nhe priest. If you manage to generate enough focus after practice, the mantr=\r\na/ritual may actually produce some result. There is no harm in trying.\n\n* *=\r\n *\n\nMany people think that poojas to gods are a serious matter and only a t=\r\nrained priest should do them. The procedures have evolved to become quite c=\r\nomplicated over the time too!\n\nHowever, complexity of rituals should never =\r\nbe a deterrent. Suppose rules dictate that you MUST eat 2000 calories every=\r\nday, 40 grams of protein, so many grams of vitamin A etc. Suppose you have =\r\nno access to such balanced food. Will you starve yourself until you find a =\r\nbalanced meal or will you manage with whatever you have? If you just have a=\r\n bowl of dal (lentil soup) and rice, you will simply eat it. You atleast ge=\r\nt some energy.\n\nSimilarly, if you do not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a man=\r\ntra/ritual, you need not wait till you know the perfect way. You can start =\r\nwith what you know. It will only give you energy.\n\n* * *\n\nThe fear to do ri=\r\ntuals without &quot;perfect knowledge&quot; stems from the notion that some mantras/r=\r\nituals can be dangerous. That notion is not totally baseless, but it is irr=\r\nelevant today.\n\nIt is possible to focus the mind on some mantras and ritual=\r\ns and get specific results. When used by someone with a high level of spiri=\r\ntual energy, some mantras and rituals may work very fast and give specific =\r\npowerful results. However, Nature has purposely hidden (almost) such things=\r\n in this age.\n\nI will give an analogy. A machine gun and a stick can be use=\r\nd to attack enemies. Stick is safe to use, but, one using a machine gun nee=\r\nds to be very careful. One needs to learn well, practice well and then use =\r\nit, lest one should hurt oneself by accident.\n\nHowever, suppose the house l=\r\nord purposely removed ammunition from the machine gun. Then it is used just=\r\n like a stick and not risky. Instead of waiting for perfect instructions on=\r\n how to use the machine gun, just take it and start beating your enemies wi=\r\nth it.\n\n&quot;Ammunition&quot; has purposely been removed from most targeted mantras =\r\nand rituals (machine guns) in this age. Instead of waiting for perfect know=\r\nledge, one can start using them right away.\n\nA lot of technicalities relate=\r\nd to mantras and rituals are irrelevant today. Mantras and rituals are to b=\r\ne taken up with faith, devotion and surrender to god. Whatever technicaliti=\r\nes one can realistically follow should be followed and emphasis should be p=\r\nlaced on devotion and surrender. If one keeps doing sadhana, eventually one=\r\n&#39;s devotion and focus will improve and, for all you know, a result may come=\r\n.\n\nGiven that we do not have perfect focus and surrender, we cannot expect =\r\nspecific results to come in specific counts of recitation. So we should jus=\r\nt do the best job we can and leave the result to god, who decides when and =\r\nwhat result should be given.\n\nBottomline is that no effort is wasted in the=\r\n end. Every sincere effort generates some fruit or the other, sometime or t=\r\nhe other!!!\n\n* * *\n\nDifferent mantras and rituals are like begging bowls of=\r\n different shapes. They matter only so much. Depending on what kind of a be=\r\ngging bowl you use, you may be given different kind of alms. But it is impo=\r\nrtant to start begging with some begging bowl or the other, instead of spen=\r\nding years looking for the perfect begging bowl.\n\nInstead of waiting for as=\r\ntrologers with half-baked or ill-conceived knowledge to tell you the perfec=\r\nt mantra or ritual, do what your heart tells you or what your guru (or an e=\r\nlder you respect) tells you. Mantras like Gayatri mantra, Shiva panchakshar=\r\ni mantra, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra, Ganapathi atharva seersha, Hanuman ch=\r\nalisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vishnu&#39;s shadakshari/ ashtakshari/ dwadas=\r\nakshari mantra, Venkateswara&#39; s ashtakshari/ dwadasakshari mantra, hare kri=\r\nshna mantra, Chandipath (Durga saptashati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahas=\r\nranaama stotra, Vyasa&#39;s navagraha stotra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi ashtotta=\r\nrashatanaam a stotra etc are *generic* and can work for anyone for any purp=\r\nose.\n\nDo not waste time looking for a perfect recommendation, perfect proce=\r\ndure, perfect muhurta etc and just do some sadhana or the other with a sinc=\r\nere heart.\n\nYour effort will not go waste. Your problem may be solved or yo=\r\nu may overcome your situation and stop worrying, or atleast your focus will=\r\n improve.\n\n* * *\n\nIn this context, I want to say a few words about homam, t=\r\nhe sadhana of rishis.\n\nFire ritual is found in many ancient religions. Unli=\r\nke the elements of earth, water and air, fire is ever pure and it purifies =\r\nwhatever it comes in contact with. The Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i=\r\n.e. purifier. Fire is a living god that everyone has access to. Spending ti=\r\nme worshipping god through fire purifies one&#39;s subtle consciousness. Homam =\r\nis far more effective than most other sadhanas in improving one&#39;s focus, ch=\r\nanging one&#39;s inner personality and removing material and spiritual obstacle=\r\ns. One need not take my words for granted. One can try for oneself for a fe=\r\nw months. The proof of the pudding is in eating it.\n\nVedic seers (rishis) p=\r\nerformed homam regularly, for the benefit of the world. When composing the =\r\nJyotish masterpiece &quot;Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram&quot; just before the adve=\r\nnt of Kali yuga, for guidance to the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara=\r\n recommended various types of homam as remedial measures for various proble=\r\nms in the horoscope. In fact, most remedies he recommended involve homam. P=\r\narasara asked to follow whatever procedures one was taught for starting fir=\r\ne and did not focus on the nitty gritty of homam. He only gave the main man=\r\ntra to beused in homam. Parasara&#39;s clear teachings set to rest the notion t=\r\nhat some people have, that homam is not for Kali yuga.\n\n* * *\n\nIn Bhagavad =\r\nGita, Sri Krishna said, &quot;yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi&quot; , i.e. I am japa among =\r\nall sacrifices. Some people use this line to suggest that japam (meditation=\r\n) is superior to homa/yajna. Let me put that in perspective.\n\nIn the line j=\r\nust above that line, Sri Krishna also said, &quot;I am Om among all mantras&quot;. Ho=\r\nwever, do we only meditate with the supreme mantra &quot;Om&quot; and leave all other=\r\n mantras?\n\nIf one says that sitting on the pinnacle is the best part of cli=\r\nmbing a mountain, it does not mean that the process of climbing it using va=\r\nrious kinds of gear is useless. In fact, one needs that process to reach th=\r\ne pinnacle. Most cannot reach the pinnacle directly.\n\nSimilarly, Om is the =\r\nsupreme of all mantras being the source of all, but reaching the source may=\r\n require using several mantras first to purify oneself. Meditating and abso=\r\nrbing consciousness in the Supreme (japa) may be the supreme sacrifice, but=\r\n it may require purification and preparation by engaging in other kinds of =\r\nsacrifices (hama/yajna) .\n\nWhen one does homam or yajna, one is engaging in=\r\n external actions and one is unlikely to reach samadhi (absorbption in the =\r\nSupreme). When a perfectly purified person does japam (i.e. sits still and =\r\ncontemplates) , one may reach samadhi. However, to purify oneself, homam is=\r\n far more effective.\n\n* * *\n\nDetailed manuals giving short procedures for d=\r\noing various types of homam by oneself are available on the website given b=\r\nelow. You can use the resources on that website to perform several kinds of=\r\n short homam by yourself.\n\nNow *hundreds* of people are performing homam by=\r\n themselves either daily or weekly. Some people are also doing monthly.\n\nWh=\r\nen Manish (my spiritual guru - a small write-up on him can be read in messa=\r\nge 3481 of vedic-wisdom yahoogroup, i.e. http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ve=\r\ndic- wisdom/message/ 3481) told me that the Divine Mother appeared before h=\r\nim during Shata Chandi homam at a temple in Chennai in March 2006, directed=\r\n him to spread a simplified homam ritual around the world, and showed him t=\r\nhat hundreds of thousands of people would be performing regular homam in a =\r\nfew years, thus helping reverse the decay of Dharma and Truth on earth, it =\r\nseemed quite far-fetched to my rational mind.\n\nHowever, just 4 years after =\r\nthe Mother&#39;s command, hundreds of people are already performing regular hom=\r\nam. Though these are just the early days, the developments are amazing. Som=\r\ne of them are laymen who never even lit a lamp and did not know how to do A=\r\nNY pooja or ritual. It is a miracle that such people are doing a homam ever=\r\nyday, like the rishis and Brahmanas of yore. I also know personally that so=\r\nme people doing homam for a couple of years are actually starting to experi=\r\nence things within and outside and, more importantly, going through rapid i=\r\nnternal transformation.\n\n* * *\n\nI am neither a missionary nor a mercenary. =\r\nI do not sell anything to anyone, nor do I force anything on anyone. I just=\r\n freely share what I know, what I saw and what I am inspired to share. The =\r\nrest is not in my hands.\n\nI want to respectfully, humbly and lovingly invit=\r\ne those who have even an iota of interest to check out the homam website! I=\r\nf one gets into the habit of performing homam regularly, it has the great p=\r\notential to transform one&#39;s life, materially and spiritually. .\n\nHomam webs=\r\nite:\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\nFree Jyotish Sof=\r\ntware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manu=\r\nals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nFilm=\r\ns that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\nSpirituality: http://g=\r\nroups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups. yaho=\r\no.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- -\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n      \r\n--0-1999042821-1276080661=:94559\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Rajarshi,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I don=\r\n&#39;t think we need to throw out Astrology completely ..its a fantastic tool a=\r\ngain having its own purpose..but as Narasimha says surrender to god and do =\r\nsadhana..then i guess everything in life opens up for&nbsp;us in life..incl=\r\nuding astrology in its tue sense.. than it is&nbsp; being currently taught.=\r\n..&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Cheers&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;KK&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Tue, 6/8/=\r\n10, rajarshi nandy &lt;I&gt;&lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid; PADDING-LEFT=\r\n: 5px; MARGIN-LEFT: 5px&quot;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;From: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@....i=\r\nn&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Efficacy of Remedial Measures&lt;BR&gt;To: v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Tuesday, June 8, 2010, 4:18 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1720819314&gt;&lt;SPAN style=3D&quot;DISPLAY: none&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/SPAN&gt; \n&lt;DIV =\r\nid=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;TABLE border=3D0 cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0&gt;\n&lt;T=\r\nBODY&gt;\n&lt;TR&gt;\n&lt;TD vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Namaste,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;EM=\r\n&gt;Instead of waiting for astrologers with half-baked or ill-conceived knowle=\r\ndge to tell you the perfect mantra or ritual,&lt;/EM&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;This is soo true!

Let me first address why this h=\r\nas come to be and then talk about what we should do.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In ancient time=\r\ns, caste system was not as rigid as it is today. One&#39;s varna was decided ba=\r\nsed on one&#39;s aptitude. One primarily interested in knowledge and spiritual =\r\nprogress would be a Brahmana. One\n primarily interested in power, authority=\r\n and control over others would be a Kshatriya. One primarily interested in =\r\nmoney would be a Vaisya. One primarily interested in physical pleasures wou=\r\nld be a Shudra. One would start off with the varna of one&#39;s father, as that=\r\n is what one is exposed to in childhood. However, as one&#39;s vasana (mental c=\r\nonditioning) blooms, one would get one&#39;s own varna. One born a Shudra like =\r\nValmiki, for example, can later turn into a Braahmana and become a Maharshi=\r\n. One born a Kshatriya like Viswamitra, for example, can later turn into a =\r\nBrahmana and become a Maharshi.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the old days, there were true Bra=\r\nhmanas, who would only be interested in knowledge and spiritual progress an=\r\nd not caring about power, influence, money, pleasures etc. Such Brahmanas b=\r\necame quite pure and accumulated enough spiritual energy through continuous=\r\n sadhana over years and were capable of performing very effective poojas fo=\r\nr people.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Today,\n people who have spiritual potential may be born in=\r\n non-Brahmana families and not allowed to develop fully due to the rigid ca=\r\nste structures. Some people born in Brahmana families may also end up getti=\r\nng into modern careers and not developing fully as Brahmanas. Some people m=\r\nay be born in Brahmana families with Kshatriya/Vaisya/ Shudra tendencies an=\r\nd may end up becoming priests who are interested in power, authority and co=\r\nntrol over others, money and physical pleasures. Those priests who only car=\r\ne about knowledge and spiritual progress (i.e. true Brahmanas) are very rar=\r\ne. As a result, Brahmanas who have done genuine sadhana and accumulated a g=\r\nood amount of spiritual energy are so few.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one has o=\r\nne million dollars in one&#39;s bank account, a check given by one for thousand=\r\n dollars is meaningful. If one&#39;s bank account is empty, what good is a thou=\r\nsand dollar check given by one? It will bounce. Similarly, poojas done and =\r\nblessings given\n by a priest without enough spiritual energy cannot bring o=\r\nne any benefits.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One important note: The power is not in a combinati=\r\non of syllables (mantra) or a sequence of physical actions (ritual). The po=\r\nwer is in the MIND that FOCUSES on a combination of syllables (mantra) or a=\r\n sequence of physical actions (ritual). Energy is generated when mind overc=\r\nomes its tendency to wander and instead focuses on one thing. Different man=\r\ntras and rituals as the focus points may generate different kinds of energy=\r\n, but the key is focus. Without it, no mantra or ritual produces anything. =\r\nFocus comes with a lot of practice. Most priests are just engaging in casua=\r\nl practice when they go and do poojas. In the old days, priests did intense=\r\n sadhana and brought that energy to the table when they did rituals at the =\r\nhouses of people or in temples.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I did see priests who have done good=\r\n sadhana, purified themselves and carry some spiritual energy. But those ar=\r\ne getting\n rarer and rarer now-a-days. One can most certainly not bank on f=\r\ninding such a priest.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Given this, one is better off not=\r\n depending on the priest/Brahmana class for remedies. BTW, I have nothing a=\r\ngainst the &quot;Brahmana by birth&quot; class, having been born in an orthodox Brahm=\r\nana family myself. I have neither love nor hatred for the &quot;Brahmana by birt=\r\nh&quot; class. My only wish is that more people - from any birth caste - develop=\r\n into true Brahmanas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead of a Brahmana-by- birth who is possibl=\r\ny proud of his skills and thinking about money and possibly not identifying=\r\n with your trouble, you can do the mantra/ritual yourself. Atleast your ide=\r\nntification with the trouble and your desire to solve the problem will be b=\r\netter than the priest. If you manage to generate enough focus after practic=\r\ne, the mantra/ritual may actually produce some result. There is no harm in =\r\ntrying.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Many people think that poojas to gods are a\n se=\r\nrious matter and only a trained priest should do them. The procedures have =\r\nevolved to become quite complicated over the time too!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, comp=\r\nlexity of rituals should never be a deterrent. Suppose rules dictate that y=\r\nou MUST eat 2000 calories everyday, 40 grams of protein, so many grams of v=\r\nitamin A etc. Suppose you have no access to such balanced food. Will you st=\r\narve yourself until you find a balanced meal or will you manage with whatev=\r\ner you have? If you just have a bowl of dal (lentil soup) and rice, you wil=\r\nl simply eat it. You atleast get some energy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Similarly, if you do n=\r\not know the &quot;perfect way&quot; to do a mantra/ritual, you need not wait till you=\r\n know the perfect way. You can start with what you know. It will only give =\r\nyou energy.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The fear to do rituals without &quot;perfect kno=\r\nwledge&quot; stems from the notion that some mantras/rituals can be dangerous. T=\r\nhat notion is not totally baseless, but it is irrelevant\n today.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It =\r\nis possible to focus the mind on some mantras and rituals and get specific =\r\nresults. When used by someone with a high level of spiritual energy, some m=\r\nantras and rituals may work very fast and give specific powerful results. H=\r\nowever, Nature has purposely hidden (almost) such things in this age.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;I will give an analogy. A machine gun and a stick can be used to attack e=\r\nnemies. Stick is safe to use, but, one using a machine gun needs to be very=\r\n careful. One needs to learn well, practice well and then use it, lest one =\r\nshould hurt oneself by accident.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;However, suppose the house lord pur=\r\nposely removed ammunition from the machine gun. Then it is used just like a=\r\n stick and not risky. Instead of waiting for perfect instructions on how to=\r\n use the machine gun, just take it and start beating your enemies with it.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Ammunition&quot; has purposely been removed from most targeted mantras a=\r\nnd rituals (machine guns) in this age. Instead of\n waiting for perfect know=\r\nledge, one can start using them right away.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A lot of technicalities =\r\nrelated to mantras and rituals are irrelevant today. Mantras and rituals ar=\r\ne to be taken up with faith, devotion and surrender to god. Whatever techni=\r\ncalities one can realistically follow should be followed and emphasis shoul=\r\nd be placed on devotion and surrender. If one keeps doing sadhana, eventual=\r\nly one&#39;s devotion and focus will improve and, for all you know, a result ma=\r\ny come.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Given that we do not have perfect focus and surrender, we ca=\r\nnnot expect specific results to come in specific counts of recitation. So w=\r\ne should just do the best job we can and leave the result to god, who decid=\r\nes when and what result should be given.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Bottomline is that no effor=\r\nt is wasted in the end. Every sincere effort generates some fruit or the ot=\r\nher, sometime or the other!!!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Different mantras and rit=\r\nuals are like begging bowls of different\n shapes. They matter only so much.=\r\n Depending on what kind of a begging bowl you use, you may be given differe=\r\nnt kind of alms. But it is important to start begging with some begging bow=\r\nl or the other, instead of spending years looking for the perfect begging b=\r\nowl.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Instead of waiting for astrologers with half-baked or ill-conce=\r\nived knowledge to tell you the perfect mantra or ritual, do what your heart=\r\n tells you or what your guru (or an elder you respect) tells you. Mantras l=\r\nike Gayatri mantra, Shiva panchakshari mantra, Vishnu sahasranaama stotra, =\r\nGanapathi atharva seersha, Hanuman chalisa, Bheemarupi Hanuman stotra, Vish=\r\nnu&#39;s shadakshari/ ashtakshari/ dwadasakshari mantra, Venkateswara&#39; s ashtak=\r\nshari/ dwadasakshari mantra, hare krishna mantra, Chandipath (Durga saptash=\r\nati), Durga saptashloki, Lalita sahasranaama stotra, Vyasa&#39;s navagraha stot=\r\nra, Aditya Hridayam, Lakshmi ashtottarashatanaam a stotra etc are *generic*=\r\n and can work for anyone for any\n purpose.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do not waste time looking=\r\n for a perfect recommendation, perfect procedure, perfect muhurta etc and j=\r\nust do some sadhana or the other with a sincere heart.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Your effort w=\r\nill not go waste. Your problem may be solved or you may overcome your situa=\r\ntion and stop worrying, or atleast your focus will improve.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In this context, I want to say a few words about homam, the sadhana of=\r\n rishis.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Fire ritual is found in many ancient religions. Unlike the =\r\nelements of earth, water and air, fire is ever pure and it purifies whateve=\r\nr it comes in contact with. The Sanskrit name for fire is paavaka, i.e. pur=\r\nifier. Fire is a living god that everyone has access to. Spending time wors=\r\nhipping god through fire purifies one&#39;s subtle consciousness. Homam is far =\r\nmore effective than most other sadhanas in improving one&#39;s focus, changing =\r\none&#39;s inner personality and removing material and spiritual obstacles. One =\r\nneed not take my words for\n granted. One can try for oneself for a few mont=\r\nhs. The proof of the pudding is in eating it.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Vedic seers (rishis) p=\r\nerformed homam regularly, for the benefit of the world. When composing the =\r\nJyotish masterpiece &quot;Brihat Paaraasara Horaa Saastram&quot; just before the adve=\r\nnt of Kali yuga, for guidance to the people of Kali yuga, Maharshi Parasara=\r\n recommended various types of homam as remedial measures for various proble=\r\nms in the horoscope. In fact, most remedies he recommended involve homam. P=\r\narasara asked to follow whatever procedures one was taught for starting fir=\r\ne and did not focus on the nitty gritty of homam. He only gave the main man=\r\ntra to beused in homam. Parasara&#39;s clear teachings set to rest the notion t=\r\nhat some people have, that homam is not for Kali yuga.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\nIn Bhagavad Gita, Sri Krishna said, &quot;yaGYaanaaM japayaGYo.asmi&quot; , i.e. I am=\r\n japa among all sacrifices. Some people use this line to suggest that japam=\r\n (meditation) is\n superior to homa/yajna. Let me put that in perspective.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;In the line just above that line, Sri Krishna also said, &quot;I am Om amo=\r\nng all mantras&quot;. However, do we only meditate with the supreme mantra &quot;Om&quot; =\r\nand leave all other mantras?&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If one says that sitting on the pinnacl=\r\ne is the best part of climbing a mountain, it does not mean that the proces=\r\ns of climbing it using various kinds of gear is useless. In fact, one needs=\r\n that process to reach the pinnacle. Most cannot reach the pinnacle directl=\r\ny.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Similarly, Om is the supreme of all mantras being the source of a=\r\nll, but reaching the source may require using several mantras first to puri=\r\nfy oneself. Meditating and absorbing consciousness in the Supreme (japa) ma=\r\ny be the supreme sacrifice, but it may require purification and preparation=\r\n by engaging in other kinds of sacrifices (hama/yajna) .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When one do=\r\nes homam or yajna, one is engaging in external actions and one is unlikely =\r\nto reach\n samadhi (absorbption in the Supreme). When a perfectly purified p=\r\nerson does japam (i.e. sits still and contemplates) , one may reach samadhi=\r\n. However, to purify oneself, homam is far more effective.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Detailed manuals giving short procedures for doing various types of hom=\r\nam by oneself are available on the website given below. You can use the res=\r\nources on that website to perform several kinds of short homam by yourself.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Now *hundreds* of people are performing homam by themselves either =\r\ndaily or weekly. Some people are also doing monthly.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;When Manish (my=\r\n spiritual guru - a small write-up on him can be read in message 3481 of ve=\r\ndic-wisdom yahoogroup, i.e. &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-=\r\nwisdom/message/3481&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups. yahoo.co=\r\nm/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 3481&lt;/A&gt;) told me that the Divine Mother ap=\r\npeared before him during Shata Chandi homam at a temple in Chennai in March=\r\n 2006,\n directed him to spread a simplified homam ritual around the world, =\r\nand showed him that hundreds of thousands of people would be performing reg=\r\nular homam in a few years, thus helping reverse the decay of Dharma and Tru=\r\nth on earth, it seemed quite far-fetched to my rational mind.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Howeve=\r\nr, just 4 years after the Mother&#39;s command, hundreds of people are already =\r\nperforming regular homam. Though these are just the early days, the develop=\r\nments are amazing. Some of them are laymen who never even lit a lamp and di=\r\nd not know how to do ANY pooja or ritual. It is a miracle that such people =\r\nare doing a homam everyday, like the rishis and Brahmanas of yore. I also k=\r\nnow personally that some people doing homam for a couple of years are actua=\r\nlly starting to experience things within and outside and, more importantly,=\r\n going through rapid internal transformation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;* * *&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am neit=\r\nher a missionary nor a mercenary. I do not sell anything to anyone, nor do\n=\r\n I force anything on anyone. I just freely share what I know, what I saw an=\r\nd what I am inspired to share. The rest is not in my hands.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I want t=\r\no respectfully, humbly and lovingly invite those who have even an iota of i=\r\nnterest to check out the homam website! If one gets into the habit of perfo=\r\nrming homam regularly, it has the great potential to transform one&#39;s life, =\r\nmaterially and spiritually. .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Homam website:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://ww=\r\nw.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;----------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish Soft=\r\nware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual ma=\r\nnuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastr=\r\nologer.org/&quot; rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org=\r\n&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Films that make a difference: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/=\r\n&quot;\n rel=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://SaraswatiFil ms.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spiritu=\r\nality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; rel=3Dnofollo=\r\nw target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Jyot=\r\nish writings: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri ting=\r\ns&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n      \r\n--0-1999042821-1276080661=:94559--\r\n\n"}}
