For one half of the year, they would\nstudy their branch of the veda. For the other half of the year, they\nwould study the vedangas (vyakarana, jyotisha etc). Both of these were\nimportant milestones. The ceremony which marked the commencement of\nthe vedic study for the year was the &#39;upaakarma&#39;. The ceremony which\nmarked the end of the vedic study for the year was the &#39;utsarjana&#39;.\nThe two words literally mean &#39;commencement&#39; and &#39;abandonment&#39;\nrespectively.\n\nIn time, this practice was discontinued, and vedic study continued\nthroughout the year. The &#39;utsarjana&#39; ceremony itself was dropped, and\nonly the &#39;upaakarma&#39; was retained. Those who study the Rig and Yajur\nvedas perform the &#39;upaakarma&#39; in the full moon of the shravana month\n(i.e. tomorrow). Those who study the Sama veda perform it a little\nlater in the month.\n\nThe one and only purpose behind the &#39;upaakarma&#39; is to restart the\nstudy of the vedas. Everything else is secondary. Leaving aside the\ndaily rituals that are supposed to be performed each and every day,\nthis is what is done on the &#39;upaakarma&#39; day according to the krishna\nyajur veda tradition:\n\n1) To atone for the fact that the &#39;utsarjana&#39; was not performed, the\n&#39;kAmokArShiit&#39; japa is performed.\n2) A tarpana to the rishis of the vedic branch is performed, for their\nblessings before the vedic study starts.\n3) veda vyAsa is worshipped in a kalasha, for his blessings before the\nvedic study starts.\n4) A homa to the rishis of the vedic branch is performed, for their\nblessings before the vedic study starts.\n5) In the presence of agni, the student starts learning some mantras\nof the veda from his teacher.\n\nToday, many people go to a temple, recite the mahasankalpa, change the\nyagyopavita, do the kanda rishi tarpana and then come home. In modern\nterms, this is like a student who is excited to go to college. He gets\ndressed in new clothes, takes the permission of his parents, but\ndecides not to go to any of his college classes.\n\nSome people do stay for a &quot;ritual vedArambha&quot;, which they perform\nevery year. This is like a student who enrolls in college every year.\nHe goes to the first day of classes, drops out, and then comes back\nfor the first day of classes during the following year.\n\nThe upaakarma is a commencement ceremony -- the first day of vedic\nclasses for the year. Those who are interested should arrange for\nvedic classes on a regular basis, from a local vedic scholar. In fact,\nit is quite surprising that temples organize upakarma programs, but\ndon&#39;t offer any followup classes.\n\nMaybe a few people can work with their local temples / priests. Take\ndown the names of interested people during the upaakarma, and work\nwith some vedic scholars to arrange follow-up classses. That would be\nmuch more productive.\n\nsasneham,\n\n   ajit\n\n"}}
