He also talked about \n\nthe hierar=\r\nchy of spiritual caliber mentioned by V. I want to share 2 \n\ncents of musin=\r\ngs on that.\n\n\n\n-------------------------------\n\nMeasuring Spiritual Caliber=\r\n\n\n\n\nRajarshi, here are a few comments on your statements a couple of days \n=\r\n\nback on Twitter comparing spiritual caliber. We can&#39;t even compare \n\nflowe=\r\nrs like hibiscus, rose, jasmine, mogra, kewda, lotus etc & say \n\nwhich is a=\r\n better flower. They have different properties like color, \n\nsize, shape, n=\r\number of petals, type/intensity of smell etc. Relative \n\nvalues depend on t=\r\nhe purpose and they cannot be quantified universally. \n\nHow can any sane pe=\r\nrson then say that spiritual caliber of different \n\npeople can be compared =\r\nand quanitified? The field of duality has \n\ninfinite variety and the [self-=\r\n]control of a yogi has infinite aspects \n\nto it. You cannot quantify the sp=\r\niritual caliber of a person as one \n\nnumber and compare them.\n\n\n\nBefore one=\r\n even attempts to understand Vimalananda&#39;s order (Paramahamsa \n\n&lt; Siddha &lt; =\r\nNatha &lt; Rishi), please note that different hierarchies exist \n\nin scripture=\r\ns for deities also. Some consider a hierarchy of deities \n\nwhere Vishnu is =\r\nsupreme. Some consider a hierarchy of deities where \n\nShiva is supreme. Som=\r\ne consider a hierarchy of deities where Shakti is \n\nsupreme. And so on. Non=\r\ne of them is absolute. All of them are relative \n\nand for specific purposes=\r\n, i.e. from a specific perspective. There are \n\npeople who take them as abs=\r\nolute and argue that so and so thing taught \n\nby Vishnu is superior to so a=\r\nnd so thing taught by Shiva, etc. But we \n\nknow that none of the hierarchie=\r\ns is absolute.\n\n\n\nOne who has the nerve to think that one can compare the w=\r\nisdom of \n\nJnaneshwar, dispassion of Ramana Maharshi, mad devotion of Ramak=\r\nrishna \n\nParamahamsa, detached activism of Vivekananda, compassion of Shird=\r\ni Sai, \n\nspiritual ecstasy of Vama Khepa, inner clarity of Lahiri Mahashaya=\r\n, \n\ndetachment of Trilinga Swami, purity of Tukaram, humility of Eknath \n\nM=\r\naharaj, ecstatic love of Meera Bai, motherly love of Gopaler Ma, etc, \n\nis =\r\na fool of the highest order. They can be compared from specific \n\nlimited p=\r\nerspectives. In one thing, Tukaram may be superior to all, in \n\nanother Jna=\r\nneshwar, in another Trilinga, in another Ramakrishna, and so \n\non. You cann=\r\not compare in absolute terms. You should not even try to. \n\nYou should just=\r\n appreciate them individually and aspire to be like any \n\nof them that you =\r\nlike the most.\n\n\n\nVimalananda&#39;s list may be correct from specific perspecti=\r\nve. More \n\nimportantly, his words should make one realize that there is alw=\r\nays \n\nscope for further self-control (and the resulting mastery over the fi=\r\neld \n\nof duality) while one is still embodied. One should never rest and \n\n=\r\naspire for better self-control. But taking it as gospel and starting to \n\nj=\r\nudge yogis based on that is unwise. Especially making statements like \n\n&quot;Vi=\r\nmalananda is heavier than all RK&#39;s discples put togtr&quot; and thinking \n\nthat =\r\nsomething is absolute truth because Vimalananda is assumed to have \n\nsaid t=\r\nhat (vs someone &quot;lower than him&quot;) is unwise.\n\n\n\nEven if Vimalananda&#39;s hiera=\r\nrchy is absolute and universal, don&#39;t assume \n\nthat you can judge the statu=\r\nre of each yogi accurately. Because \n\nRamakrishna was popularly known as a =\r\nParamahamsa, is he a Paramahamsa as \n\nper Vimalananda&#39;s classification or a=\r\n siddha or a natha or even a rishi? \n\nOr may be a deity? My friend, don&#39;t a=\r\nssume you know for sure!!! Based on \n\nthe details we know, can we be absolu=\r\ntely sure of even Vimalananda&#39;s \n\nstature based on his own classification?\n=\r\n\n\n\nYou said &quot;Approximating 2 equal to each disciples of ramakrishna. 2exp16=\r\n \n\n=3D say Vimalananda. Basic?&quot; You probably made this statement based on \n=\r\n\nwhat you read and heard of Vimalananda. For the sake of argument, it is \n\n=\r\nnot even 100% clear whether he was a real person or an imagined \n\ncharacter=\r\n. Svoboda intentionally (and very wisely!) left the latter \n\noption open in=\r\n the preface of his Aghora book!\n\n\n\nIf we MUST compare spiritual calibers, =\r\none possibility is to use a \n\nsimpler definition of how close one is to lib=\r\neration as a measure of \n\none&#39;s &quot;spiritual caliber&quot;, Ramakrishna&#39;s disciple=\r\ns fare quite well. RK \n\ntold Abhedananda that it was going to be his last b=\r\nirth. Others would be \n\nback, but he would be liberated. To Yogananda, he s=\r\naid there would be \n\none more birth and he would be free forever after that=\r\n. Vimalananda, on \n\nthe other hand, had atleast one more birth clearly as h=\r\ne said a body was \n\nwaiting for him. That way, forget about &quot;RK&#39;s discples =\r\nput togtr&quot;, just \n\nAbhedananda alone is superior to Vimalananda!\n\n\n\nAgain, =\r\nplease note that this is just one definition. One can have many \n\ndefinitio=\r\nns. The key is not to jump to unwise conclusions on any \n\nhierarchies and s=\r\nay that &quot;X is weightier than Y and so what he said must \n\nbe more correct&quot;.=\r\n\n\n\n\nPeople with lopsided understanding of scriptures take relative knowledg=\r\ne \n\nto be absolute and jump to unwise conclusions. I am afraid some people =\r\n\n\nare doing the same now with &quot;modern scriptures&quot; such as the Aghora \n\nbook=\r\ns. Don&#39;t fall into the trap of taking something as gospel or as \n\nabsolute.=\r\n Written words are always relative and never absolute. \n\nDiscriminate relat=\r\nive knowledge using intellect at first and hopefully \n\nusing experencial re=\r\nalization later on.\n\n\n\nMore importantly, while we are still searching for &quot;=\r\nmaturity&quot;, we should \n\nnot commit the &quot;error&quot; of making negative judgmental=\r\n comments of greats \n\nwho did far more sadhana than us and experienced a lo=\r\nt more than us.\n\n-------------------------------\n\n\n\nBest regards,\n\nNarasimh=\r\na\n\n----------------------------------------------------------\n\n   Free Jyot=\r\nish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; rit=\r\nual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n\n                   http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org\n\n      Films that make a difference: http://Saraswat=\r\niFilms.org\n\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=\r\n\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n\n      =\r\n                Twitter ID: @homam108\n\n------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n\n\n\n    \n     \n\n    \n    \n\n\n \n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-1229954704-1312540250=:51733\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Dear          Narsimha - Namaste&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;Good explainations.

The key is not to jump to unwise conclusions on any &lt;br&gt;\nhierarchies an=\r\nd say that &quot;X is weightier than Y and so what he said must &lt;br&gt;\nbe more cor=\r\nrect&quot;.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nPeople with lopsided understanding of scriptures take relat=\r\nive knowledge &lt;br&gt;\nto be absolute and jump to unwise conclusions. I am afra=\r\nid some people &lt;br&gt;\nare doing the same now with &quot;modern scriptures&quot; such as=\r\n the Aghora &lt;br&gt;\nbooks. Don&#39;t fall into the trap of taking something as gos=\r\npel or as &lt;br&gt;\nabsolute. Written words are always relative and never absolu=\r\nte. &lt;br&gt;\nDiscriminate relative knowledge using intellect at first and hopef=\r\nully &lt;br&gt;\nusing experencial realization later on.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nMore importantly=\r\n, while we are still searching for &quot;maturity&quot;, we should &lt;br&gt;\nnot commit th=\r\ne &quot;error&quot; of making negative judgmental comments of greats &lt;br&gt;\nwho did far=\r\n more sadhana than us and experienced a lot more than us.&lt;br&gt;\n-------------=\r\n------------------&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;\nBest regards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha&lt;br&gt;\n---------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;\n   Free Jyotish Software, F=\r\nree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals =\r\nfor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;\n                   &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollo=\r\nw&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;http://www.Ved=\r\nicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofo=\r\nllow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://SaraswatiFilms.org&quot;&gt;http://Saraswati=\r\nFilms.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n      Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.co=\r\nm/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n   Jyotish writings: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot;&gt;http://=\r\ngroups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n                      Twitte=\r\nr ID: @homam108&lt;br&gt;\n-------------------------------------------------------=\r\n---&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/p&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n \n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tab=\r\nle&gt;\r\n--0-1229954704-1312540250=:51733--\r\n\n"}}
