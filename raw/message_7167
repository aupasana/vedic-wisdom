What a coincidence that you ask the very question I asked myself f=\r\new months ago...I&#39;m speaking from my personal experience and will defer to =\r\nNarasimhaji for the final answer.\n\nI wear rudhraksha & some months later af=\r\nter wearing the rudhrakshas, while praying, I had asked God for guidance=85=\r\n.I remembered listening to stories of Sage Agastiar while growing up & had =\r\nthought,&quot; I have no one to guide me, I don&#39;t know the path to moksha or wha=\r\ntever-is-the-highest-truth=85.I&#39;ve had enough of ridicule from my family fo=\r\nr my beliefs.... So, just so that I don&#39;t waste anymore of my energy in jus=\r\ntifying my beliefs, I seek guidance from Sage Agastiar=85At least scripture=\r\ns say that he was a great sage & if anyone needs to argue, they can argue w=\r\nith the scriptures&quot;=85=85So mentally, I would pray to Sage Agastiar and say=\r\n &quot;I don&#39;t know the mantras, puja methods etc to pray to you=85.All that I k=\r\nnow, is your name and that&#39;s all I can chant=85and I would chant his name 9=\r\n times=85&quot;=85Few months later, my family took part in Dattatreya abishekam =\r\nat the St. Louis Hindu temple in MO and still few months later, I landed up=\r\n on Dr. Pillai&#39;s website and him being Sage Agastiar in an earlier lifetime=\r\n [according to the ancient naadi leaves], kind-of-agreed with my earlier re=\r\nquest-for-guidance=85\n\nEarlier during this year, I had again & again come a=\r\ncross articles on Dr. Pillai&#39;s website that stresses the importance of thar=\r\npanam=85 &quot;If I have to recommend one solution for every one of our problems=\r\n, be it financial, relationship or health, it is doing Tarpanam. Miracles d=\r\no happen after the performance of the rituals&quot;, says Dr. Pillai=85\nMore inf=\r\no can be found here \n\nhttp://www.pillaicenter.com/shopping/ShopEvents.aspx?=\r\ncateg=3Dsearch&search=3Dtarpanam\n\nI had also read on the Agasthiar website =\r\nthe importance of tharpanam=85\n\nhttp://www.agasthiar.org/a/tharpanam.htm\n\nI=\r\n wrote to both these groups & received positive feedbacks & comments about =\r\nthe experience of people after they did daily tarpanam.\n\nI had asked God fo=\r\nr confirmation and though I don&#39;t want to mention right now what confirmati=\r\non I got, I think it is suffice to say that I got my answer.So, I started d=\r\noing daily tarpanam as shown in these videos\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?=\r\nv=3DNlFEo7IWeGY&feature=3Demail\n\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DdAxDFLHWo=\r\nNU&feature=3Demail\n\nNothing short of miracles have happened since. My paren=\r\nts are alive & they do the monthly amavasya tharpanam for my paternal grand=\r\nparents. I had infact asked my thatha & paati [my paternal grandparents who=\r\n are dead] for confirmation & they too have sent me confirmations [which ri=\r\nght now, I dont want to go into the details].....Every aspect of my life ha=\r\ns improved - spiritual, relationships, finance etc.\n\nSo, my answer to your =\r\nquestion? Do it...Ask God for your own &#39;personalized answers/confirmation&#39; =\r\nand when you get them, you will know the answer yourself and it becomes &#39;YO=\r\nUR TRUTH&#39;....Not something that some &#39;online-stranger-you-dont-even-know&#39; a=\r\nsked you to do.\n\nHope this answers your question.\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com, &quot;hiramalini&quot; &lt;hiramalini@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste, PVR Narasim=\r\nhaji !
