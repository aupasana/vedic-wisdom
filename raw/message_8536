I am doing fine and I hop=\r\ne you are doing fine too.\n\nDisagreements and difference of view-points are =\r\nabsolutely fine, afterall in ancient India from the monotheists to the athe=\r\nists, we had every breed coexisting. Having said that, I will explain a few=\r\n of the points you have raised in your email, from my perspective of course=\r\n.\n\n\n&lt;&lt;You have to complete the story.&gt;.\n\n\nThe reason I cannot add anything =\r\nmore to it is because the individual himself did not reveal anything more a=\r\nbout this.=C2=A0 For me, the incidents he revealed hold an interesting view=\r\n-point and a value on its own. When I mention any such story I only narrate=\r\n the same exactly as it is, without adding or subtracting anything from it.=\r\n Conclusions, whatever they maybe, have to be drawn by every individual. So=\r\nme may reject it, some may accept it, both of which are fine.\n\n&lt;&lt;This story=\r\n seems to like I used to read in Chandamama. This guy Iyengar seems to be a=\r\n siddha if the \nstory so far is true.and he has the ability to shape shift =\r\nand transportation. So what?? But he still needs his daily fix of bhang.&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n\nAs per the Tantric scriptures, even Lord Shiva in his form of Bhairava smo=\r\nkes ganja, drinks alcohol, eats with dogs and chandalas, roams around naked=\r\n in the smashana. So is taking intoxicants a sufficient criteria to judge a=\r\nnyone&#39;s spirituality? Not for me! \n\n,\n\n&lt;&lt;what does God mean in this tale? &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n\nI will tell you how I see it. In this story, God means infinity. Now wha=\r\nt is infinity? It cannot be described, it cannot be named, it cannot be und=\r\nerstood using the five sense organs. Science does not understand infinity, =\r\nart does not understand infinity, nothing or nobody=C2=A0 understands infin=\r\nity. It is a summation of all that we know, all that we can imagine and all=\r\n that is impossible for us to imagine. It is an incomprehensible force that=\r\n runs through everything, from the most loveable to the most despicable , f=\r\nrom the most holy to the most unholy, from the greatest saint to the stupid=\r\nest piece of rock at the bottom of the deepest ocean in the farthest planet=\r\n in the farthest solar system in the farthest universe. \n\n\nNow question is,=\r\n can an average human being &quot;know&quot; this mysterious and all pervading force?=\r\n Knowing implies understanding. Clearly no. Then how does one interact with=\r\n such a thing? One way is to consider everything, and I mean EVERYTHING fro=\r\nm living to non-living, as a manifestation of that force and thus learn to =\r\nlove the same unconditionally without expecting anything in return. No wond=\r\ner such unconditional love is not easy. It needs tremendous effort to chang=\r\ne our own conditioning of the mind, and work on our inherent biases and pre=\r\njudices. That is what the aim of sadhana is, in my view. To work on oneself=\r\n, to make one ready to be able to unconditionally love everything. The grea=\r\nter number of entities one can love unconditionally, that much little bit c=\r\nloser one can come to interacting with the truly infinite. And those few ra=\r\nre human beings who can love a whole universe unconditionally, are possibly=\r\n the closest to this supreme and unknowable force.\n In common language, we =\r\ncall them Rishis.\n\nI like all forms of Deities, for I find something beauti=\r\nful in everyone of them. And I also like the One behind forms, which is so =\r\nperfectly transcendental that it cannot be comprehended ever. It&#39;s like the=\r\n surface area of the fine tip of a needle, or the gap between the two breat=\r\nhs, or the millionth part of a single hair, or the endless-ness of space, o=\r\nr the bottomless well of stillness in the mind at certain points in meditat=\r\nion. The only thing that stops me from getting a better understanding the g=\r\nrandeur of this formless entity are the limitations of my own mind and body=\r\n, that I have acquired over millions of births. That is why Sadhana. To slo=\r\nwly gnaw away at my own mind, to be better able to appreciate this endless,=\r\n nameless entity. G_d.\n\nI do not believe in Moksha. What is Moksha? No rebi=\r\nrth? If the Universe itself gets born over and over and over, if Rama and K=\r\nrshna come back at every cycle, who am I to demand that I should not get bo=\r\nrn? Infact, when a person proverbially finishes off his/her karmas, they me=\r\nrely go to another plane in this Universe and stay there for eons of time, =\r\nsince time anyway moves very, very slowly in different realms. But then, if=\r\n this force so wants, it can send back any of the souls from any of the rea=\r\nlms to any of the other realms to serve a certain function. And if a soul s=\r\ntays in a certain higher realm and in forced to take rebirth again, the see=\r\nds of the karmas - which never really die off - are watered again by the en=\r\nvironment of birth and they sprout into saplings. And this may go even beyo=\r\nnd one cycle of creation. Else why would Krshna and Arjuna fight the very s=\r\name enemies that they had been fighting in the past cycle of creation? Maha=\r\nbharata says so.\n I believe it. \n\n\nWhat then is the final aim of all this, =\r\nspirituality etc? I don&#39;t know. Maybe, to teach us to broaden our perspecti=\r\nves and consequentially lessen our attachments to our otherwise mundane liv=\r\nes and its mundane problems. This is like a circular roller-coaster ride we=\r\n see in local melas. Tighten the seat-belts, bring a smile in the heart, be=\r\n detached and enjoy the show!\n\nBest of luck and take good care of yourself!=\r\n\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |=\r\n\nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\n______________________=\r\n__________\n From: Laxmi Narayan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Saturday, 28 Jul=\r\ny 2012 7:30 PM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=\r\n=E2=80=99t believe in any religion\n \n\n=C2=A0 \nDear Rajarshi Bhai,\nHow are y=\r\nou? You have to complete the story. you have to tell what happened when X w=\r\nent to meet this man in temple.or anything else which happened. It is like =\r\nsomebody gone in kitchen to get rest of meal and not come back.\n\nFirst I ha=\r\nve to thank you for writing that story about Divine Mother Sri Chinnmastaji=\r\n. I had developed a fear about Her but 3 times I got spiritual indications =\r\nover the period of 2 months that I should write my story. When you wrote ba=\r\nck suddenly my fear about Her melted away and I did immediate prayers to He=\r\nr. Thanks.\n\nThe other thing is can I dare to say that I do not agree what i=\r\ns in this thread. Why does this so called spiritual man has to dump his fai=\r\nlure on religion. If people do not believe in religion or God or afterlife,=\r\n it is their problem. We are not all equal. We all do not come from same st=\r\nock. We are born with different conditions, go through different life exper=\r\niences and go where our fate or destiny takes us. This world is composed of=\r\n 3 gunas and there is always going to tension of different sort. Why =C2=A0=\r\nblame it on religion or God, why not on greed and desire to control others =\r\nand lord over them using what ever mean.\n\nThis story seems to like I used t=\r\no read in Chandamama. This guy Iyengar seems to be a siddha if the story so=\r\n far is true.and he has the ability to shape shift and transportation. So w=\r\nhat?? But he still needs his daily fix of bhang.\n\nwhat does God mean in thi=\r\ns tale? Is it Creator God or Divine Lord Of Sri Vrindavan or =C2=A0Divine M=\r\nother or =C2=A0Self Realisation or Universal God or Jewish God or Formless =\r\nGod or Fire God?? After all there was a dhoni fire there? Or some other God=\r\n ??\n\nSri Vrindavan has a rolling population. They are not in confusion. Man=\r\ny people come there only for curiosity, many other come only for Darshan in=\r\n the Temple and go back home happy. many others come with different desires=\r\n. It is very wrong to expect from a person who is in fifth grade to have kn=\r\nowledge of 15th grade.\n\nMany times people go to temple to pray and ask for =\r\ncertain things and if it does not happen they become very anti religion and=\r\n anti God. So what?? It has nothing to do with me or you or anybody else. I=\r\nt is their life.\n\nI was very very very ill. Nobody was helping me. Many peo=\r\nple were giving me lot of pain. =C2=A0I went from Religious place to religi=\r\nous place, temple to temple, holy man to holy man. Nothing seem to worked. =\r\nThen I took up religious practise of doing mantra japa and other things whi=\r\nch are in scriptures and Grace of Divine Mother it worked. It is totally re=\r\nligious discipline according to our scriptures.\n\nDo you drive a car? Did yo=\r\nu pass you exam first time? I do not drive a car. It will take me several e=\r\nxams to pass it. Many people pass their test first time and drive successfu=\r\nlly. Does it mean I should blame car or exams or examiner or road for my fa=\r\nilure??? .Many people take up spiritual life and if they do not find succes=\r\ns quickly they blame religion and God.\n\nI also used to think that a real ex=\r\nperience of God would be very powerful thing. but there are other aspects t=\r\no it. If someone is totally dependent on Divine Mother and calls on Her day=\r\n and night, but yet he is not ready for certain energy or his body is not c=\r\nlean enough to receive a new light, then Divine Mother would appear to him =\r\nin very gentle way to comfort him and to console so that he remains on the =\r\npath. She will appear right in front of him but he only sees the Golden Aur=\r\na and not what is middle of it because he is not yet ready. Whenever I thin=\r\nk of that moment I am filled with deep bliss and joy and wonderment.\n\nYou a=\r\nre a special person doing everyday intense haven to spread the light.Many o=\r\nther people in this group are doing haven everyday to fill their life with =\r\nlight of Divine Beings. This is a complete religious method which is also t=\r\notally spiritual thing.Please do not get impressed with pseudo spiritual ta=\r\nlk and tales of shape shifting. Is everything alright in your everyday life=\r\n because I felt a sadness in your mail? I am sure I am very wrong in this.\n=\r\n\nFew days ago Olympic flame passed right outside my road.I did not go out t=\r\no see it. I kept holding to the Light which comes out of Divine Mothers Fee=\r\nt hoping it will become permanent in my life.\n\nGood Luck and =C2=A0Joy for =\r\nyou.\nLaxmiNarayan\n\n\n\n________________________________\n From: rajarshi nandy=\r\n &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com&gt; \nSent: Monday, 23 July 2012, 11:04\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wis=\r\ndom] To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion\n \n\n\n\n=\r\n\nDear Ajit,\n\nI am in complete agreement with your thoughts.=C2=A0 A spiritu=\r\nal man once said, &quot;Religion has been created to shield people from God&quot;.=C2=\r\n=A0\n\nWhen I first heard this I was not convinced and thought it was some fa=\r\nke secularism. Lately I realized this is literally true. Heavy psychologica=\r\nl constructs are created by religions to protect an average person from the=\r\n real experience of God, which is so powerful and overwhelming that if and =\r\nwhen it happens, it can effectively cause a hurricane in your average life =\r\nand pretty much destroy all your well laid plans.\n\n\nI will briefly narrate =\r\na true and interesting incident. \n\n\nAn individual - say X - had gone to Vri=\r\nndavan to stay there for some years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famou=\r\ns sadhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing u=\r\nnblinking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing a=\r\nt the satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the rag=\r\nged looking man. Then he did a pranam to the man and said, &quot;Maharaj, please=\r\n tell us some words of God&quot;. The man became angry, and retorted back, &quot;Why?=\r\n Why waste time talking of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all =\r\nwill run away. So please continue with your lectures as you were doing befo=\r\nre I came in&quot;. Everyone became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile=\r\n the sweets came, the man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky=\r\n and then got up and started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who =\r\nwas lecturing, looked at his followers and said, &quot;He is a sadhu who comes t=\r\no Vrindavan once in a while,\n but he has probably lost his mental balance d=\r\nue to smoking too much ganja&quot;. Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird=\r\n reason felt attracted to that ragged man and went out to see where the guy=\r\n was going. As he approached the ragged looking man, the man turned around =\r\nand spoke to X in clear English, &quot;Hello, I was waiting for you to come and =\r\njoin me.&quot; X was of course taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in E=\r\nnglish and more over he had no clue how the man got to know that he knew En=\r\nglish (X was dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). \n\n\nThe man =\r\ncontinued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near Chennai, was an Engineer=\r\n by profession, but left home long back and have been a wondering sadhu sin=\r\nce then.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu who was doing the satsa=\r\nng? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actually this God thing itself =\r\nis source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not the hordes of Sadhus, no=\r\nt ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the reason for all the religiou=\r\ns troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a little irritated, &quot;Why do you have=\r\n so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? If you have been a sadhu=\r\n for long, then how come you haven&#39;t met a single genuine sadhu yet, how is=\r\n it possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;Well if I take Vrindavan alone, there =\r\nis only one genuine man here, rest are all as confused as anybody else, mer=\r\nely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot meet that man, he is not=\r\n accessible to others.&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;The root of\n all this proble=\r\nm is this God business. Know it for certain, that man cannot know God ever.=\r\n What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the human brain to comprehend. =\r\nAt best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a magnified woman with s=\r\nuper-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, one day he will create =\r\nthis form by a projection of his own mind, and he may even acquire supernat=\r\nural abilities from this form, and generally be regarded by others as a man=\r\n of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say the root of the problem =\r\nis trying to understand the infinite with a finite mind and then stressing =\r\nthat one has understood correctly.&quot; While talking, the sadhu stopped at a s=\r\nmall tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pull finished off the chil=\r\nlum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 minutes, slowly releasing=\r\n the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You (meaning X) are a young m=\r\nan. Have a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t get\n confused by all these show o=\r\nf spirituality you see in holy places. When I was your age, I did a lot of =\r\nterrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I was an infamous young ma=\r\nn in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But then one day having nothi=\r\nng better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 decades, I slowly realize=\r\nd what God really is and how to interact with this thing.&quot; As he spoke he r=\r\neached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a young girl came out of t=\r\nhe house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar inturn said to X, you too =\r\ncome inside, these people love me a lot so when I come to Vrindavan I stay =\r\nat their house. I will show you something interesting if you join me.\n\n\nAft=\r\ner an hour inside the house, X was feeling very bored and irritated. The wo=\r\nman was bringing different fruits and sweets for their food while the young=\r\n girl was massaging Mr Iyengar&#39;s feet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the=\r\n hospitality. X thought this man is one more fraud, he abuses everyone else=\r\n but has no qualms about shamelessly accepting the hospitality of a househo=\r\nlder and enjoying a good life. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he=\r\n saw that the man and the woman and the girl=C2=A0 stood up and with folded=\r\n hands were bowing down towards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X =\r\nwas sitting on the floor, facing the opp direction to the cot. He too turne=\r\nd round to see what was going on. What he saw made his jaw drop open in sho=\r\nck. Instead of the old, bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat =\r\non the cot a young man, who looked in his early twenties, whose whole skin =\r\nwas dazzlingly fair, emanating a brilliant glow that lightened up the\n whol=\r\ne room. He had a shaved head, four arms, holding lotus and weapons, with en=\r\nchantingly beautiful eyes! It looked not a human being any more but a god s=\r\nitting in place of what was even five minutes back only a frail, dirty-look=\r\ning Mr Iyengar.\n\n\nX did not know what was happening. He saw the young man g=\r\nestured towards him to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnotize=\r\nd, X got up and walked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X lo=\r\nst all consciousness. When he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a re=\r\nmote location with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearby, =\r\nheld his hand and took him inside the temple precincts. There he saw a dhun=\r\ni burning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with ash=\r\n all over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that meditat=\r\ning man to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I was tal=\r\nking about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one in Vr=\r\nindavan currently who has an idea what God really means. After providing di=\r\nrections of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X again an=\r\nd immediately he felt he was losing awareness of place/time and lapsed into=\r\n\n unconsciousness again. \n\n\nWhen X woke up, he was in the room in that hous=\r\ne, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the bed, his old, ragged self, wit=\r\nh a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, X went to the temple as direct=\r\ned. \n\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n=C2=A0\nawaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAma=\r\nbuddhayah |\nparam bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n\n\n___________=\r\n_____________________\n From: Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;\nTo: ve=\r\ndic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \nSent: Monday, 23 July 2012 8:13 AM\nSubject: Re:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any rel=\r\nigion\n \n\n=C2=A0 \nDear Prasanth,\n\n&gt; To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t=\r\n believe in any religion\n\n\n\n\nIn general, many of those who don&#39;t believe in=\r\n religion or God are being more honest than those who do. After all, most p=\r\neople who believe in God look at him as a limited being to barter with. All=\r\n of our biases and assumptions are most apparent when dealing with our Gods=\r\n. Often, religion has simply served to formalize these biases.\n\nWhile being=\r\n mired in this word of duality, we think that an ounce of insincere prayer =\r\ncan undo the whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in throughout the day. =\r\nAnd we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that others look at all the suff=\r\nering in the world and laugh at this concept of God. We &quot;God believers&quot; are=\r\n the culprit.\n\nWe all have plenty of paapa and punya in our karmic pipeline=\r\n. Instead of asking for the strength to be steadfast while we reap both kin=\r\nds of fruits, we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot; and leave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. It i=\r\ns us &quot;God believers&quot; who look at our lives, ignoring all the &quot;paapa phala&quot;.=\r\n We look at one or two instances of &quot;punya phala&quot; and declare our prayers t=\r\no be successful. However, an impartial observer sees it for what it is, and=\r\n laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are the culprit.\n\nFor the most part, our =\r\nbhakti is weak. When we are engaged in spiritual practices, our bhakti is p=\r\narticularly weak, and we count the seconds and minutes. When engaged in wor=\r\nldly pursuits, our bhakti is strong, and time really flies. And yet, we exp=\r\nect God to reward our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our strong worldly b=\r\nhakti. An impartial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;=\r\nGod believers&quot; are the culprit.\n\nThe best way to bring about new waves of b=\r\nhakti is not to look at the &quot;non-believers&quot; and try to convert them. All we=\r\n have to do is try to eliminate our lack of belief, and be honest with ours=\r\nelves. If we can transform ourselves, the world will be served.\n\nIf we see =\r\nGod as the limitless power that he is, he is difficult to define. It is dif=\r\nficult to capture him within a religion. Religion should see itself as a st=\r\nepping-stone, and should ask each of us to _eventually_ place our feet on t=\r\nop of it to reach the higher goals. Unfortunately, most religions ask us to=\r\n accept them without question. They ask us to place our heads on them with =\r\nreverence, and try to prevent the spiritually advanced from going any farth=\r\ner.\n\nsasneham,\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0 =C2=A0ajit\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n \r\n--2124734478-1049343322-1343594958=:81242\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ve=\r\nrdana, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Laxmi Narayan =\r\nji,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Thank you for your e=\r\nmail. I am doing fine and I hope you are doing fine too.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Disagreemen=\r\nts and difference of view-points are absolutely fine, afterall in ancient I=\r\nndia from the monotheists to the atheists, we had every breed coexisting. H=\r\naving said that, I will explain a few of the points you have raised in your=\r\n email, from my perspective of course.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;&lt;&lt;span&gt;You have to complete the story.&gt;.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The reason I =\r\ncannot add anything more to it is because the individual himself did not re=\r\nveal anything more about this.&nbsp; For me, the incidents he revealed hold=\r\n an interesting view-point and a value on its own&lt;/span&gt;. When I mention an=\r\ny such story I only narrate the same exactly as it is, without adding\n or s=\r\nubtracting anything from it. Conclusions, whatever they maybe, have to be d=\r\nrawn by every individual. Some may reject it, some may accept it, both of w=\r\nhich are fine.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;&lt;&lt;span&gt;This story seems to l=\r\nike I used\n to read in Chandamama. This guy Iyengar seems to be a siddha if=\r\n the \nstory so far is true.and he has the ability to &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv5917035=\r\n80misspell-8&quot; class=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;shape shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and transportation=\r\n. So what?? But he still needs his daily fix of bhang.&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;As pe=\r\nr the Tantric scriptures, even Lord Shiva in his form of Bhairava smokes ga=\r\nnja, drinks alcohol, eats with dogs and chandalas, roams around naked in th=\r\ne smashana. So is taking intoxicants a sufficient criteria to judge anyone&#39;=\r\ns spirituality? Not for me! &lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;,&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;&lt;what does God mean in this tale? &gt;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I will tell you how I see it. In this story, God means inf=\r\ninity. Now what is infinity? It cannot be described, it cannot be named, it=\r\n cannot be understood using the five sense organs. Science does not underst=\r\nand infinity, art does not understand infinity, nothing or nobody&nbsp; und=\r\nerstands infinity. It is a summation of all that we know, all that we can\n =\r\nimagine and all that is impossible for us to imagine. It is an incomprehens=\r\nible force that runs through everything, from the most loveable to the most=\r\n despicable , from the most holy to the most unholy, from the greatest sain=\r\nt to the stupidest piece of rock at the bottom of the deepest ocean in the =\r\nfarthest planet in the farthest solar system in the farthest universe. &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Now question is, can an average human being &quot;know=\r\n&quot; this mysterious and all pervading force? Knowing implies understanding. C=\r\nlearly no. Then how does one interact with such a thing? One way is to cons=\r\nider everything, and I mean EVERYTHING from living to non-living, as a mani=\r\nfestation of that force and thus learn to love the same unconditionally wit=\r\nhout expecting anything in return. No wonder such unconditional love is not=\r\n easy. It needs tremendous effort to change our own conditioning of the min=\r\nd, and work on our inherent biases and prejudices. That is what the\n aim of=\r\n sadhana is, in my view. To work on oneself, to make one ready to be able t=\r\no unconditionally love everything. The greater number of entities one can l=\r\nove unconditionally, that much little bit closer one can come to interactin=\r\ng with the truly infinite. And those few rare human beings who can love a w=\r\nhole universe unconditionally, are possibly the closest to this supreme and=\r\n unknowable force. In common language, we call them Rishis.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I like a=\r\nll forms of Deities, for I find something beautiful in everyone of them. An=\r\nd I also like the One behind forms, which is so perfectly transcendental th=\r\nat it cannot be comprehended ever. It&#39;s like the surface area of the fine t=\r\nip of a needle, or the gap between the two breaths, or the millionth part o=\r\nf a single hair, or the endless-ness of space, or the bottomless well of st=\r\nillness in the mind at certain points in meditation. The only thing that st=\r\nops me from getting a better understanding the grandeur of\n this formless e=\r\nntity are the limitations of my own mind and body, that I have acquired ove=\r\nr millions of births. That is why Sadhana. To slowly gnaw away at my own mi=\r\nnd, to be better able to appreciate this endless, nameless entity. G_d.&lt;/di=\r\nv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I do not believe in Moksha. What is Moksha? No rebirt=\r\nh? If the Universe itself gets born over and over and over, if Rama and Krs=\r\nhna come back at every cycle, who am I to demand that I should not get born=\r\n? Infact, when a person proverbially finishes off his/her karmas, they mere=\r\nly go to another plane in this Universe and stay there for eons of time, si=\r\nnce time anyway moves very, very slowly in different realms. But then, if t=\r\nhis force so wants, it can send back any of the souls from any of the realm=\r\ns to any of the other realms to serve a certain function. And if a soul sta=\r\nys in a certain higher realm and in forced to take rebirth again, the seeds=\r\n of the karmas - which never really die off - are\n watered again by the env=\r\nironment of birth and they sprout into saplings. And this may go even beyon=\r\nd one cycle of creation. Else why would Krshna and Arjuna fight the very sa=\r\nme enemies that they had been fighting in the past cycle of creation? Mahab=\r\nharata says so. I believe it. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;What then is th=\r\ne final aim of all this, spirituality etc? I don&#39;t know. Maybe, to teach us=\r\n to broaden our perspectives and consequentially lessen our attachments to =\r\nour otherwise mundane lives and its mundane problems. This is like a circul=\r\nar roller-coaster ride we see in local melas. Tighten the seat-belts, bring=\r\n a smile in the heart, be detached and enjoy the show!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;Best of luck and take good care of yourself!&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n-Regards&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div c=\r\nlass=3D&quot;MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size:1=\r\n6px;&quot;&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;Apple-style-span&quot;\n style=3D&quot;color:rgb(153, 153, 153=\r\n);&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-family:times new roman, new york, times, serif;&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimAp=\r\nannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;yui_3_2_0_2_1342=\r\n43506227946 yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249952 yui_3_2_0_18_134358699658282&quot; style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT-SIZE:10pt;COLOR:navy;FONT-FAMILY:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot;=\r\n face=3D&quot;Times New Roman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttam=\r\nam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: verdana, helvetica, sans-serif; font-size: 10=\r\npt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new york, times, serif; f=\r\nont-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;hr si=\r\nze=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Laxmi Nara=\r\nyan &lt;shrijishrihari@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: b=\r\nold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;\n &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com&gt; &lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; =\r\nSaturday, 28 July 2012 7:30 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Su=\r\nbject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=E2=80=\r\n=99t believe in any religion&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv591703580=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;d=\r\niv id=3D&quot;yiv591703580ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#0=\r\n00;background-color:#fff;font-family:arial, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size=\r\n:10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Rajarshi Bhai,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;How are you? =\r\nYou have to complete the story. you have to tell what happened when X went =\r\nto meet this man in temple.or anything else which happened.

I had developed a fear abou=\r\nt Her but 3 times I got spiritual indications over the period of 2 months t=\r\nhat I should write my story. When you wrote back suddenly my fear about Her=\r\n melted away and I did immediate prayers to Her. Thanks.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nspan&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;The other thing is can I dare to say that =\r\nI do not agree what is in this thread. Why does this so called spiritual ma=\r\nn has to dump his failure on\n religion. If people do not believe in religio=\r\nn or God or afterlife, it is their problem. We are not all equal. We all do=\r\n not come from same stock. We are born with different conditions, go throug=\r\nh different life experiences and go where our fate or destiny takes us. Thi=\r\ns world is composed of 3 gunas and there is always going to tension of diff=\r\nerent sort. Why &nbsp;blame it on religion or God, why not on greed and des=\r\nire to control others and lord over them using what ever mean.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;This story seems to like I used to r=\r\nead in Chandamama. This guy Iyengar seems to be a siddha if the story so fa=\r\nr is true.and he has the ability to &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv591703580misspell-8&quot; cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;shape shift&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; and transportation. So what?? But h=\r\ne still needs his daily fix of bhang.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;what does God mean in this tale? Is it Creator God or Divine =\r\nLord Of Sri Vrindavan or\n &nbsp;Divine\n Mother or &nbsp;Self &lt;span id=3D&quot;yi=\r\nv591703580misspell-12&quot; class=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;Realisation&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; or Univer=\r\nsal God or Jewish God or Formless God or Fire God?? After all there was a d=\r\nhoni fire there? Or some other God ??&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;Sri Vrindavan has a rolling population. They are not in confu=\r\nsion. Many people come there only for curiosity, many other come only for D=\r\narshan in the Temple and go back home happy. many others come with differen=\r\nt desires. It is very wrong to expect from a person who is in fifth grade t=\r\no have knowledge of 15th grade.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;Many times people go to temple to pray and ask for certain things and if =\r\nit does not happen they become very anti religion and anti God. So what?? I=\r\nt has nothing to do with me or you or anybody else. It is their life.&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I was very very very ill. Nobody was helping me. Many p=\r\neople were giving me lot of pain.\n &nbsp;I went\n from Religious place to re=\r\nligious place, temple to temple, holy man to holy man. Nothing seem to work=\r\ned. Then I took up religious &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv591703580misspell-18&quot; class=3D&quot;=\r\n&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;practise&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; of doing mantra japa and other things which =\r\nare in scriptures and Grace of Divine Mother it worked. It is totally relig=\r\nious &lt;span id=3D&quot;yiv591703580misspell-20&quot; class=3D&quot;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;discipline&lt;/span=\r\n&gt;&lt;/span&gt; according to our scriptures.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Do you drive=\r\n a car? Did you pass you exam first time? I do not drive a car. It will tak=\r\ne me several exams to pass it. Many people pass their test first time and d=\r\nrive successfully. Does it mean I should blame car or exams or examiner or =\r\nroad for my failure??? .Many people take up spiritual life and if they do n=\r\not find success quickly they blame religion and God.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;I also used to think that a real experience of God would be very powerfu=\r\nl thing. but there are other aspects to it. If\n someone is totally\n depende=\r\nnt on Divine Mother and calls on Her day and night, but yet he is not ready=\r\n for certain energy or his body is not clean enough to receive a new light,=\r\n then Divine Mother would appear to him in very gentle way to comfort him a=\r\nnd to console so that he remains on the path. She will appear right in fron=\r\nt of him but he only sees the Golden Aura and not what is middle of it beca=\r\nuse he is not yet ready. Whenever I think of that moment I am filled with d=\r\neep bliss and joy and wonderment.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;You are a specia=\r\nl person doing everyday intense haven to spread the light.Many other people=\r\n in this group are doing haven everyday to fill their life with light of Di=\r\nvine Beings. This is a complete religious method which is also totally spir=\r\nitual thing.Please do not get impressed with pseudo spiritual talk and tale=\r\ns of shape shifting. Is everything alright in your everyday life because I =\r\nfelt a sadness in your mail? I am sure I am very wrong in\n this.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Few days ago Olympic flame passed right outside my road.I di=\r\nd not go out to see it. I kept holding to the Light which comes out of Divi=\r\nne Mothers Feet hoping it will become permanent in my life.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;=\r\n/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Good Luck and &nbsp;Joy for you.&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;LaxmiNarayan&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:arial, helvetica, san=\r\ns-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family:times, serif;font-size:=\r\n12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt; =\r\n &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; rajarshi nandy &lt;r=\r\najarshi14@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;/b&gt; &quot;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Monday, 23 July =\r\n2012, 11:04&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re=\r\n: [vedic-wisdom] To those who\n say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any r=\r\neligion&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv591703580&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n        \n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);background-color:rgb(2=\r\n55, 255, 255);font-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;span&gt;Dear Ajit,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;I a=\r\nm in complete agreement with your thoughts.&nbsp; A spiritual man once said=\r\n, &quot;Religion has been created to shield people from God&quot;.&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When I first heard this I was not convinced and thought=\r\n it was some fake secularism. Lately I realized this is literally true. Hea=\r\nvy psychological constructs are created by religions to protect an average =\r\nperson from the real experience of God, which is so powerful and overwhelmi=\r\nng that if and when it happens, it can effectively cause a hurricane in you=\r\nr average life and pretty much destroy all your well laid plans.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I will briefly narrate a true and interesting incident. =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;An individual - say X - had gone to Vrindavan=\r\n to\n stay there for some\n years. He was sitting at a satsang of a famous sa=\r\ndhu, enjoying the discourse, when a ragged looking man, with piercing unbli=\r\nnking eyes, comes over and asks for food. The sadhu who was lecturing at th=\r\ne satsang, stopped and ordered someone to bring some sweets for the ragged =\r\nlooking man. Then he did a pranam to the man and said, &quot;Maharaj, please tel=\r\nl us some words of God&quot;. The man became angry, and retorted back, &quot;Why? Why=\r\n waste time talking of God, no one wants God anyway. If God comes, all will=\r\n run away. So please continue with your lectures as you were doing before I=\r\n came in&quot;. Everyone became uncomfortably silent hearing this. Meanwhile the=\r\n sweets came, the man took a sweet into his mouth, looked up at the sky and=\r\n then got up and started walking off. After he went out, the Sadhu who was =\r\nlecturing, looked at his followers and said, &quot;He is a sadhu who comes to Vr=\r\nindavan once in a while, but he has probably lost his mental balance due to=\r\n smoking too much\n ganja&quot;. Now X, who was sitting there, for some weird rea=\r\nson felt attracted to that ragged man and went out to see where the guy was=\r\n going. As he approached the ragged looking man, the man turned around and =\r\nspoke to X in clear English, &quot;Hello, I was waiting for you to come and join=\r\n me.&quot; X was of course taken aback, did not expect the man to speak in Engli=\r\nsh and more over he had no clue how the man got to know that he knew Englis=\r\nh (X was dressed in the garb of a sadhu - saffron clothes). &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The man continued, &quot;My name is Mr Iyengar. I was born near C=\r\nhennai, was an Engineer by profession, but left home long back and have bee=\r\nn a wondering sadhu since then.&quot; X asked him, why did you derive the sadhu =\r\nwho was doing the satsang? Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;All this is bogus. Actually=\r\n this God thing itself is source of all confusion. No one has a clue. Not t=\r\nhe hordes of Sadhus, not ordinary folks, really no one. And God is the reas=\r\non for all\n the religious troubles and other nonsense.&quot; X felt a little irr=\r\nitated, &quot;Why do you have so much bitterness about religion/God/sadhus etc? =\r\nIf you have been a sadhu for long, then how come you haven&#39;t met a single g=\r\nenuine sadhu yet, how is it possible?&quot;. Mr Iyengar replied, &quot;Well if I take=\r\n Vrindavan alone, there is only one genuine man here, rest are all as confu=\r\nsed as anybody else, merely different degrees of confusion. But you cannot =\r\nmeet that man, he is not accessible to others.&quot; Mr Iyengar continued, &quot;The =\r\nroot of all this problem is this God business. Know it for certain, that ma=\r\nn cannot know God ever. What is infinite is beyond the capacity of the huma=\r\nn brain to comprehend. At best a man will only imagine a magnified man or a=\r\n magnified woman with super-powers. If the individual keeps doing sadhana, =\r\none day he will create this form by a projection of his own mind, and he ma=\r\ny even acquire supernatural abilities from this form, and generally be rega=\r\nrded\n by others as a man of god. But God is beyond this. That is why I say =\r\nthe root of the problem is trying to understand the infinite with a finite =\r\nmind and then stressing that one has understood correctly.&quot; While talking, =\r\nthe sadhu stopped at a small tea-stall and bought some ganja, and in one pu=\r\nll finished off the chillum. Then held the smoke in a kumbaka for about 5 m=\r\ninutes, slowly releasing the smoke in small bits. Then he continued, &quot;You (=\r\nmeaning X) are a young man. Have a clear mind in your head, don&#39;t get confu=\r\nsed by all these show of spirituality you see in holy places. When I was yo=\r\nur age, I did a lot of terrible mistakes in the impetuousness of youth. I w=\r\nas an infamous young man in the locality of Chennai where I grew up. But th=\r\nen one day having nothing better to do, I left home. After roaming for 3 de=\r\ncades, I slowly realized what God really is and how to interact with this t=\r\nhing.&quot; As he spoke he reached a two storied house, and a man, woman and a\n =\r\nyoung girl came out of the house. They invited him inside and Mr Iyengar in=\r\nturn said to X, you too come inside, these people love me a lot so when I c=\r\nome to Vrindavan I stay at their house. I will show you something interesti=\r\nng if you join me.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;After an hour inside the ho=\r\nuse, X was feeling very bored and irritated. The woman was bringing differe=\r\nnt fruits and sweets for their food while the young girl was massaging Mr I=\r\nyengar&#39;s feet as he lay down on a cot, enjoying the hospitality. X thought =\r\nthis man is one more fraud, he abuses everyone else but has no qualms about=\r\n shamelessly accepting the hospitality of a householder and enjoying a good=\r\n life. As soon as this thought crossed his mind, he saw that the man and th=\r\ne woman and the girl&nbsp; stood up and with folded hands were bowing down =\r\ntowards the cot where Mr Iyengar was lying down. X was sitting on the floor=\r\n, facing the opp direction to the cot. He too turned round to see\n what was=\r\n going on. What he saw made his jaw drop open in shock. Instead of the old,=\r\n bald, ragged beggar that was Mr Iyengar, there sat on the cot a young man,=\r\n who looked in his early twenties, whose whole skin was dazzlingly fair, em=\r\nanating a brilliant glow that lightened up the whole room. He had a shaved =\r\nhead, four arms, holding lotus and weapons, with enchantingly beautiful eye=\r\ns! It looked not a human being any more but a god sitting in place of what =\r\nwas even five minutes back only a frail, dirty-looking Mr Iyengar.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div=\r\n&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;X did not know what was happening. He saw the young ma=\r\nn gestured towards him to stand up and come near the cot. Like being hypnot=\r\nized, X got up and walked upto the cot and the young man embraced him and X=\r\n lost all consciousness. When he woke up, he saw he was near a temple, in a=\r\n remote location with trees and shrubs all around. Old Mr Iyengar was nearb=\r\ny, held his hand and took him inside the temple precincts.\n There he saw a =\r\ndhuni burning, and next to it an old man, naked, sitting in meditation with=\r\n ash all over his body. Mr Iyengar did not say a word, pointed out that med=\r\nitating man to him and then took X out of the temple. That is the man I was=\r\n talking about, he said. You should meet him tomorrow. He is the only one i=\r\nn Vrindavan currently who has an idea what God really means. After providin=\r\ng directions of how to reach that desolate temple, Mr Iyengar hugged X agai=\r\nn and immediately he felt he was losing awareness of place/time and lapsed =\r\ninto unconsciousness again. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;When X woke up, h=\r\ne was in the room in that house, lying on the floor. Mr Iyengar was on the =\r\nbed, his old, ragged self, with a mischievous smile on his face. Next day, =\r\nX went to the temple as directed. &lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;-Regards&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;br&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;div\n class=3D&quot;yiv591703580MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span class=3D&quot;=\r\nyiv591703580yui_3_2_0_2_134243527249950&quot; style=3D&quot;font-family:times, serif;=\r\n&quot;&gt;awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span class=\r\n=3D&quot;yiv591703580yui_3_2_0_2_134243506227946 yiv591703580yui_3_2_0_2_1342435=\r\n27249952 yiv591703580yui_3_2_0_18_134302381638082&quot; style=3D&quot;font-size:10pt;=\r\ncolor:navy;font-family:Verdana;&quot;&gt;&lt;font color=3D&quot;#000000&quot; face=3D&quot;Times New =\r\nRoman&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-family:verdana, helvetica, sans-serif;font-size:10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;fo=\r\nnt-family:times, serif;font-size:12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;=\r\n face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From=\r\n:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Ajit Krishnan &lt;ajit.krishnan@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span sty=\r\nle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt;\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt; =\r\n&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Monday, 23 July 2012\n=\r\n 8:13 AM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Re: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] To those who say that they don=E2=80=99t believe in any relig=\r\nion&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv591703580&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;sp=\r\nan&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv591703580ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n  =\r\n    &lt;div&gt;Dear Prasanth,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&gt; To those who say that=\r\n they don=E2=80=99t believe in any religion&lt;br&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;In general, many of those who don&#39;t believe in religion or God =\r\nare being more honest than those who do. After all, most people who believe=\r\n in God look at him as a limited being to barter with. All of our biases an=\r\nd assumptions are most apparent when dealing with our Gods. Often, religion=\r\n has simply served to formalize these biases.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Wh=\r\nile being mired in this word of duality, we think that an ounce of insincer=\r\ne prayer can undo the whole weight of &quot;paapa&quot; that we engage in throughout =\r\nthe day. And we lay this bias on our God. No wonder that others look at all=\r\n the suffering in the world and laugh at this concept of God. We &quot;God belie=\r\nvers&quot; are the culprit.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;We all have plenty of paa=\r\npa and punya in our karmic pipeline. Instead of asking for the strength to =\r\nbe steadfast while we reap both kinds of fruits, we ask God to burn &quot;paapa&quot;=\r\n and leave the &quot;punya&quot; intact. It is us &quot;God believers&quot; who look at our liv=\r\nes, ignoring all the &quot;paapa phala&quot;. We look at one or two instances of &quot;pun=\r\nya phala&quot; and declare our prayers to be successful. However, an impartial o=\r\nbserver sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot; are th=\r\ne culprit.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;For the most part, our bhakti is weak=\r\n. When we are engaged in spiritual practices, our bhakti is particularly we=\r\nak, and we count the seconds and minutes. When engaged in worldly pursuits,=\r\n our bhakti is strong, and time really flies. And yet, we expect God to rew=\r\nard our weak spiritual bhakti and ignore our strong worldly bhakti. An impa=\r\nrtial observer sees it for what it is, and laughs at us. We &quot;God believers&quot;=\r\n are the culprit.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;The best way to bring about ne=\r\nw waves of bhakti is not to look at the &quot;non-believers&quot; and try to convert =\r\nthem. All we have to do is try to eliminate our lack of belief, and be hone=\r\nst with ourselves. If we can transform ourselves, the world will be served.=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;If we see God as the limitless power that he is=\r\n, he is difficult to define. It is difficult to capture him within a religi=\r\non. Religion should see itself as a stepping-stone, and should ask each of =\r\nus to _eventually_ place our feet on top of it to reach the higher goals. U=\r\nnfortunately, most religions ask us to accept them without question. They a=\r\nsk us to place our heads on them with reverence, and try to prevent the spi=\r\nritually advanced from going any farther.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;sasneh=\r\nam,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp;ajit&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;\n\n    \n    \n&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;c=\r\nolor:white;&quot;&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n=\r\n     \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--2124734478-1049343322-1343594958=:81242--\r\n\n"}}
