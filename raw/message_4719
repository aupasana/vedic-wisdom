God sent Narendra and not sand to Paramhamsa.\n \nAgreed. Ramakrishna not =\r\nonly came with his own group of people, but said that the same group of peo=\r\nple would accompany him again. When waiting for Narendra and others to come=\r\n to him, Ramakrishna used to climb on the roof and bitterly cry for their c=\r\noming. Thus, what you say is true too, i.e. the disciples Ramakrishna worke=\r\nd with were special. But, what Vivekananda said must also be true and not j=\r\nust a vain display of humility. After all, he knew Ramakrishna very well.\n =\r\n\nFor example, Krishna moulded Arjuna into a great rajarshi. Obviously, Arju=\r\nna is special and Krishna chose Arjuna for a reason. But, one will not be w=\r\nrong to say that Krishna could&#39;ve moulded *anyone* into a great rajarshi li=\r\nke Arjuna, IF he wanted!\n \n&gt; Paramhamsas do not complain, because they are =\r\nabove\n&gt; such things. But others like me feel the pain.\n \nThat is actually w=\r\nhat I was trying to get at.\n \n&gt; I do not see any essential difference with =\r\nyou at\n&gt; any point, except in usage of certain words. It is\n&gt; a minor lingu=\r\nistic problem.\n \nI have felt all along that we are on the same page, but se=\r\neing the page from slightly different perspectives. Hopefully, the differen=\r\nt ways of stating things will benefit the readers and broaden the perspecti=\r\nve. I have actually thoroughly enjoyed this discussion with you!\n \n*       =\r\n *        *\n \n&gt; For me, Guru and Istha Devata are the same. No difference.\n=\r\n \nWhat a powerful statement! Lucky is one who actually feels that way inter=\r\nnally. Reminds me of an experience with my guru.\n \nOnce my guru was talking=\r\n to me about the deep faith and belief a couple of people had in him.\n \nWhe=\r\nn I heard it, a thought passed through my mind about my not being like them=\r\n. Having a strong logical mind not yet fully tamed, I simply could not thin=\r\nk like what Rajarshi wrote above.\n \nMy guru said without my saying anything=\r\n, &quot;*You* do not have the same kind of devotion for me Narasimha. I know tha=\r\nt. Magar chakkar yeh hai ki [but the tricky part is that] *I* am devoted to=\r\n you. So you don&#39;t worry&quot;.\n \nIf a worthy sishya is fully devoted to a guru,=\r\n even an unworthy guru gets transformed into a worthy guru over time. That =\r\nis the power of pure love and faith. If a worthy guru is fully devoted to a=\r\n sishya, even an unworthy sishya gets transformed into a worthy sishya over=\r\n time. That is the power of pure love and faith.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; =\r\nBut he never found a Guru, as far as I know, and he\n&gt; does not know the los=\r\ns. Without a real Guru, religion\n&gt; is farce or at best a dead set of meanin=\r\ngless rituals.\n \nI do not like to get personal or judgmental and only made =\r\na comment in general on his question.\n \nWithout aiming at any specific pers=\r\non, I want to say one thing. In general, if anyone without a guru wants to =\r\nmake spiritual progress, I suggest turning to Agni (fire) for help.\n \nAgni =\r\nis known as paavaka, or the purifier. RigVeda 1.77.1 says about Agni: =E2=\r\n=80=9Cyo martyeShu amartyo R^itaavaa=E2=80=9D. Fire is the imperishable ess=\r\nence within perishable objects, i.e. immortal essence within mortals, and i=\r\nt is a representation of the divine Will and rhythm (R^itam). This immortal=\r\n fire devours and purifies perishable objects, qualities and conditioning w=\r\nhich are present within a mortal (and which make one a mortal).\n \nWe use ex=\r\nternal symbols to affect internal changes. Just as spending time with a mov=\r\nie enthusiast can strengthen the movie enthusiast within one and just as sp=\r\nending time with a religious person can strengthen the religious person wit=\r\nhin one, similarly spending time with fire can strengthen the fire within o=\r\nne.\n \nBy slowly reducing perishable objects within one, such as weaknesses =\r\nand other conditioning, to ashes, strengthened internal fire removes obstac=\r\nles and smoothens one&#39;s spiritual path. If an external guru is needed, he/s=\r\nhe can come when one is prepared enough.\n \nWorshipping fire is easy and ver=\r\ny effective for spiritual progress. Many civilizations have benefited from =\r\nit before.\n \nIt was the Divine Mother&#39;s command to my guru to enable a grou=\r\np of spiritual seekers across the world who worship various deities in fire=\r\n, by teaching a very simple procedure that can be performed regularly. Peop=\r\nle who have never lit a lamp in their life and have not done any rituals ha=\r\nve learned homam (havan) from the simple manuals at the homam website below=\r\n, are performing homam on a regular basis and are seeing internal transform=\r\nation. For those without a guru, fire can be a powerful guru. Fire is a liv=\r\ning representation of god on earth.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Softw=\r\nare, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manual=\r\ns for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n   =\r\n  Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writin=\r\ngs: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-astrology@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Vinay ji,\n&gt; \n&gt; //Guru =\r\nimparts true meanings to our existence as well as to everything else.//\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; There have been times where I=C3=82 have personally disagreed=C3=82 (howe=\r\nver minor it \n&gt; maybe)=C3=82 with some of your viewpoints (though I did not=\r\n mention them), the \n&gt; above=C3=82 line however=C3=82 is very, very, very t=\r\nrue.

But in fact, even G=\r\nod cannot \n&gt; create a thousand Vivekanandas, because such an act will destr=\r\noy the very plan \n&gt; of God in making the world and its time cycles. God sen=\r\nt Narendra and not sand \n&gt; to Paramhamsa. \n&gt; \n&gt; A real Guru knows who is fi=\r\nt for what. I have seen some hamsas and paramhamsas \n&gt; helping sinners and =\r\nreforming them to such an extent that lecherous and arrogant \n&gt; persons bec=\r\name pious and even monks. But at the same time, many persons near and \n&gt; de=\r\nar to those gurus, who were neither lecherous nor arrogant, could not gain =\r\n\n&gt; anything worthwhile from same gurus. Strange are the ways of God and Gur=\r\nu, but \n&gt; true disciples are no less strange. Only a Guru knows how to tap =\r\nthe hidden \n&gt; potential of a disciple. But every disciple does not possess =\r\nsame potential.\n&gt; \n&gt; No paramhamsa says that this world is unfit for his se=\r\nrvice. I am not a \n&gt; paramhamsa, and I feel I can say so for Paramhamsas on=\r\n account of what I have \n&gt; seen. Paramhamsas do not complain, because they =\r\nare above such things. But \n&gt; others like me feel the pain. \n&gt; \n&gt; I sold my=\r\n ancestral home for helping some Sanskrit institutions, and instead of \n&gt; h=\r\nelping I soon found that the entire society wanted nothing but my money, \n&gt;=\r\n without even caring for whether that money will be used for education or n=\r\not. \n&gt; All my life I worked for society, and later I found that it was my L=\r\nokaishanaa \n&gt; which was behind my zeal for the good of society. Desire is h=\r\nard to kill. It \n&gt; sublimates into seemingly benign forms.\n&gt; \n&gt; The real po=\r\nwer to help others comes not from socio-economic or political power, \n&gt; but=\r\n from real spiritual Knowledge combined with the inner Shakti of a pure sou=\r\nl. \n&gt; Those who possess this power can help others from caves. Once, a grea=\r\nt sadhu \n&gt; saved me from sure death by warning telepathically from a distan=\r\nce of many \n&gt; miles. All the real sadhus I know keep away from limelight as=\r\n well as from \n&gt; humdrum of society, yet all the hamsas or paramhamsas amon=\r\ng them help others \n&gt; without any reward.\n&gt; \n&gt; Chandragupta was lucky to fi=\r\nnd a great guru. But Chanakya was also lucky to find \n&gt; a great disciple. S=\r\nuch disciples cannot be created at will. The real war between \n&gt; disciples =\r\nof Chanakya and Aristotle (Ari+stotra =3D praiser of demons, asuras) has \n&gt;=\r\n not been properly described by historians. Had Alexander conquered India, =\r\nwe \n&gt; would have lost our culture, history and identity.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is no d=\r\nearth of Chanakyas. They will come out of caves when the need \n&gt; arises. An=\r\nd the need will soon arise. Centre of gravity of Western world is now \n&gt; tu=\r\nrning backwards, from North America to Estern Europe and then to Greece-Egy=\r\npt \n&gt; &c. And in the East, from Japan to China and then to India. First cas=\r\nualty of \n&gt; this sea change will be Christianity, at the hands of Islamic f=\r\nundamentalists. \n&gt; It will be accompanied with superpower status of India. =\r\nIt will call many \n&gt; Chanakyas and Chandraguptas. SOON !\n&gt; \n&gt; I do not want=\r\n to measure the heights or depths of hamsas and paramhamsas. They \n&gt; are al=\r\nl great, and that is all we need.\n&gt; \n&gt; I do not see any essential differenc=\r\ne with you at any point, except in usage of \n&gt; certain words.\n&gt; It is a min=\r\nor linguistic problem.\n&gt; \n&gt; Rohiniranjan is not an atheist. He is a bhakt o=\r\nf MAA, and of Ganapati Ji too. He \n&gt; is rather imaginative and wants reboot=\r\ning into a new awakening, into new \n&gt; consciousness perhaps, bored with old=\r\n religions. Perhaps his personal experience \n&gt; of men of religion is not ha=\r\nppy. But he never found a Guru, as far as I know, \n&gt; and he does not know t=\r\nhe loss.

That is why\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I sa=\r\nid in a recent post that the world does not deserve\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the service of pa=\r\nramhamsas now.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I am afraid our understanding of the word &quot;paramaha=\r\nmsa&quot; is not the same..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Swan is supposed to able to remove water fr=\r\nom milk. Similarly, a paramahamsa \n&gt; &gt;(absolute swan) is one who can extrac=\r\nt out the bad in a person and leave him \n&gt; &gt;with the good that is already i=\r\nn him. In other words, a paramahamsa is one who \n&gt; &gt;can interact with ANYON=\r\nE (with any degrees of good and bad) and transform one \n&gt; &gt;into an ideal pe=\r\nrson. For example, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa associated with \n&gt; &gt;drunkards an=\r\nd womanizers like Girish and Kalipad and transformed them.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one =\r\nthinks the world does not deserve one&#39;s services and lives in a cave, \n&gt; &gt;o=\r\nne may be great and realized, but not a paramahamsa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; In fact, look at Parasara&#39;s directives on finding a paramahamsa. He said =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;Mercury in 5th from karakamsa makes one a paramahamsa. Why Mercury and =\r\nwhy not \n&gt; &gt;Jupiter?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Jupiter is wise, but Mercury is flexible and =\r\nadaptive. Mercury can identify \n&gt; &gt;with anyone. Mercury is compassionate an=\r\nd can place himself in the shoes of \n&gt; &gt;anyone and think/feel like that per=\r\nson. That is also why Mercury is the karaka \n&gt; &gt;for good communication skil=\r\nls. A good communicator can visualize from the angle \n&gt; &gt;of his audience.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna once identified with grass so strongly that when a crow=\r\n walked on \n&gt; &gt;the grass, there were bloody scratches on his body. Such abi=\r\nlity to identify \n&gt; &gt;with someone else is needed for transforming someone e=\r\nlse. That is why Parasara \n&gt; &gt;mentioned Mercury for Paramahamsa.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *=\r\n * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; //There is no dearth of Chanakyas even today. There is, how=\r\never, not a single \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Chandragupta now. Few &quot;experts&quot;, if any, know=\r\n that Chanakya was a paramhamsa \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhu.

Creating a Chandragupta is ea=\r\nsy for someone of Chanakya&#39;s caliber.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I agree with Rajarshi on thi=\r\ns. If a Chanakya is on earth and ready to guide \n&gt; &gt;Chandragupta, a Chandra=\r\ngupta would automatically come. If a Samartha Ramadas is \n&gt; &gt;on earth and r=\r\neady too guide Shivaji, a Shivaji would automatically come.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In fac=\r\nt, Swami Vivekananda once humbly said that Ramakrishna could have created \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;one thousand Vivekanandas from sand!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; All your =\r\nstatements in this thread are true, but sometimes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; differences in our =\r\nlanguage create unnecessary confusions.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ...\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, I find your s=\r\ntatements to be absolutely true.

The \n&gt; &gt;Karma which does not produce phala for the performer is Akarma. =\r\nBrahmasutra \n&gt; &gt;speaks of four types of Moksha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; //What a self-=\r\nrealized person does is dependent on the previous history of \n&gt; &gt;that soul =\r\nand what Nature expects from one.//\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Both YES and NO! A self-re=\r\nalized soul has to bear whatever is written in \n&gt; &gt;his/her birthchart for T=\r\nHIS LIFE. But a self-realized soul burns away his/her \n&gt; &gt;entire previous h=\r\nistory of Karmas and Samskaaras and therefore does not NEED \n&gt; &gt;rebirth.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Liberated souls and incarnations of divine agencies come again a=\r\nnd again NOT \n&gt; &gt;for obeying Prakriti blindly, but for Loka-samgraha, for w=\r\nhich the entire \n&gt; &gt;Creation was created. They gain nothing in return. Rgve=\r\nda says &quot;..Adit-Suryas \n&gt; &gt;tapati Tapyatu vrithaa.&quot; Mortals perform Tapa fo=\r\nr gaining something material or \n&gt; &gt;spiritual. But why the Surya is perform=\r\ning Tapa? What Surya will gain? \n&gt; &gt;Loka-samgraha, because the Surya percei=\r\nves all other souls as its own parts and \n&gt; &gt;wants their well being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; //to remain in duality, with the senses perceiving objects of dualit=\r\ny, and \n&gt; &gt;yet remain in oneness with the underlying oneness//\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Yes, this is the proper way of living in this world for a self realized so=\r\nul. \n&gt; &gt;There is no alternative in this world. One cannot remain in perpetu=\r\nal nirvikalpa \n&gt; &gt;samadhi in this world. But it is not proper to call the f=\r\normer as a &quot;higher \n&gt; &gt;state&quot;. It is not advisable to discuss real Samadhi =\r\nin a public fora. These \n&gt; &gt;things are taught by a spiritual Guru to the di=\r\nsciple according to the \n&gt; &gt;propensity and ability of the latter.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; As you have used the term &quot;higher state&quot;, let me say that the highest s=\r\ntate \n&gt; &gt;of samadhi is indeed that type of samadhi which was attained in ba=\r\nttlefield by \n&gt; &gt;entire dynasty of Rama, and for sometime by Arjuna. \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nVina\n\n\n"}}
