That is good. This is what Vimalananda alluded to, when he said \nthose who have the desire have no knowledge and those who have the knowledge \nhave no desire in this age. He also said, &quot;if you have a deep desire to \nlearn something, nature will find a way to teach you that&quot;.\n\nIf you see the super-short method, you will see that it is very similar to \nyours. Just add the ahutis to Prajapati, Agni etc at the beginning and at \nthe end. Before you call Bhairava, call Ganesha in fire and make 8 aahuties \nwith a simple mantra (&quot;Om Gam Ganapataye Namah&quot; is fine). Then call Bhairava \nin fire. Make the offerings. After the ahutis to Agni, Vaayu etc, give \nPoornaahuti. Basically follow the super-short procedure. It is also ok to \nnot do panchopachara pooja etc. You can be informal with someone you know \nreasonably well.\n\nOf course, you can continue the way you were doing also, but the additions I \nam suggeting (ahutis at start/end and Ganesha) are small and worthwhile. As \n(if) you make additions, do it with a positive frame of mind and do NOT \nworry about past. There is a reason for everything. Just leave the past and \ndon&#39;t worry that you did some &quot;mistake&quot;. It is never a mistake to worship \ngod in the way you know. God is always happy if you do the best job you can, \nwith what you know. But, as god gives you more knowledge, he may raise the \nbar for you. :-)\n\nFor invoking Ganapathi or Bhairava in fire, thinking of the form in the mind \nand requesting him mentally to come into the fire is sufficient.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, October 04, 2008 2:42 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Homa\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimhaji\n&gt;\n&gt; I had a question I wanted to get clarified regarding homas. It was in\n&gt; 2006 that I had been doing the japa of a certain mantra for almost the\n&gt; whole year. I had come across the mantra in a strange way, but none\n&gt; the less I kept chanting the mantra. The deity is Lord Bhairav.\n&gt;\n&gt; At the end of that year suddenly due to some events I got an chance to\n&gt; visit the kumb mela as well as the Kal Bhairav and Vatuk Bhairav\n&gt; temples in Kasi. After I came back from there, I wanted to learn how\n&gt; to do a homa, but I could not find anyone to teach me the same. So one\n&gt; day I decided on doing a homa in my own way, which I realized after\n&gt; reading your homa manuals, was ridden with innumerable mistakes.\n&gt;\n&gt; The basic procedure I followed was drawing the yantra of the deity in\n&gt; the homa kunda, then praying to my deity, Lord Ganapati and the Divine\n&gt; Mother to forgive all mistakes. And next I would straight away start\n&gt; off with the main mantra and its ahuti in fire. That used to me the\n&gt; major part of the homa. And I loved watching the peculiar behaviour of\n&gt; the fire in the homa kunda.\n&gt;\n&gt; I had done this kind of (completely wrong) homa at least ten/fifteen\n&gt; times in the last one year..\n&gt;\n&gt; After reading the homa manuals I have understood the innumerable\n&gt; mistakes that I had done in the name of doing a homa. But somehow I\n&gt; liked the experineces very much.\n&gt;\n&gt; I wanted to ask you, can I continue the way I was doing or is there\n&gt; something I need to do to rectify all the mistakes that I have\n&gt; commited till now.. Waiting for your guidance..\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
