That may not even really be t=\r\nheir dharma. Knowing one&#39;s dharma, as explained below, is very difficult. A=\r\ns one becomes purer, one&#39;s dharma becomes clearer to one. The sense of dhar=\r\nma of a densely conditioned mind is corrupted by that conditioning.\n \nSecon=\r\ndly, even doing one&#39;s true dharma does not mean one does not incur karma. I=\r\nf Nature selects someone, because of one&#39;s prior conditioning and debts, to=\r\n kill thousand bad people, and one fulfils dharma by killing thousand bad p=\r\neople, that person WILL incur new karma for it. Dharma (duty) and moksha (l=\r\niberation) are two different purusharthas and not one. Fulfilling dharma is=\r\n helpful for liberation, but not sufficient.\n \nIn addition to doing dharma,=\r\n one needs to overcome ego (I-ness) and doership. As ego and the sense of d=\r\noership goes down, the speed at which new karmas are incurred goes down. Dh=\r\narma becomes clearer. For liberation, one needs to lower ego and the sense =\r\nof doership and do one&#39;s dharma (i.e. pay back debts) without attachment an=\r\nd doership.\n \nThe mail quoted by Hemanth clarifies some key concepts and wo=\r\nrth reading and understanding carefully.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish =\r\nSoftware, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual m=\r\nanuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.or=\r\ng\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish w=\r\nritings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n--------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n \n---- Se Am &lt;mahalaxmyey@y=\r\nahoo.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; i heard that Muslims used to behead meditating sages he=\r\nad when they were meditating\n&gt; so Muslims dharma is to kill other religious=\r\n people\n&gt; so will Muslims attact bad karma or sin?\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Hemanth Srini=\r\nvas &lt;hemanthks@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; \n&gt; Yes, even=\r\n I think one has to follow Dharma. But again Dharma is personal. One&#39;s Dhar=\r\nma gets refined by following detachment in actions.\n&gt; \n&gt; ------\n&gt; Here is a=\r\n repost of PVRji on Dharma and Attachment:\n&gt; \n&gt; As Vimalananda says, dharma=\r\n is indeed personal. Krishna clearly says in\n&gt; Bhagavad Geeta &quot;Follow your =\r\nown dharma. It is dangerous to follow someone\n&gt; else&#39;s dharma&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; Follow=\r\ning the path of dharma basically means engaging in the right\n&gt; action/duty.=\r\n Right action varies from person to person, from time to time\n&gt; and from pl=\r\nace to place. It is dependent on what nature expects from you,\n&gt; which in t=\r\nurn is based on who you have been in the past, what actions you\n&gt; did in th=\r\ne past while identifying with the action, who you affected in the\n&gt; past (a=\r\nnd how) with the actions that you identified with, what debts you\n&gt; created=\r\n in the process, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until\n&gt; now.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; If, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a pe=\r\nrson\n&gt; to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, based on one&#39;s =\r\nmental\n&gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to spread the m=\r\nessage of\n&gt; uniformity of all religions, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, bas=\r\ned on one&#39;s\n&gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person to =\r\nspread the\n&gt; ritual of homam in the world, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, b=\r\nased on one&#39;s\n&gt; mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a person t=\r\no make a lot of\n&gt; money and construct a temple, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The dharma of a being may change from one life to another.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; At the time of Mahabharata war, it was Arjuna&#39;s dharma to kill his gur=\r\nus,\n&gt; elders and relatives. The time then was such that there was too much =\r\nweight\n&gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tr=\r\nemendous\n&gt; destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed to a gr=\r\neat extent,\n&gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a =\r\ngreat warrior,\n&gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some people he deepl=\r\ny loved and\n&gt; respected were on the other side and it was his dharma to kil=\r\nl them.\n&gt; \n&gt; When the same Arjuna was born again in the 19th century as one=\r\n of\n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa&#39;s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in=\r\n a\n&gt; previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in=\r\n this\n&gt; new time and place. He was born to renounce material life despite h=\r\nis\n&gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the simple life of a monk and inspire=\r\n\n&gt; generations to embrace a simple life of mental detachment and service to=\r\n\n&gt; others. When he is born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna\n=\r\n&gt; said), his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; The tricky question is: How does one decide what is one&#39;s dharm=\r\na?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some people have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your ow=\r\nn dharma\n&gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castism. Though t=\r\nhe concept\n&gt; of caste (varna) has been there in Hinduism for a long time, t=\r\nhe concept of\n&gt; caste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra wh=\r\no lived by\n&gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vish=\r\nwamitra was a\n&gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and=\r\n a maharshi\n&gt; later. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off w=\r\nith the varna\n&gt; of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childh=\r\nood. As one\n&gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one =\r\ndoes.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which tells you t=\r\no know your\n&gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, there are not just=\r\n 4 dharmas in\n&gt; the world. Each person has individual dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Knowing =\r\nwhat one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pure\n&gt; enough, =\r\none will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us have a part of our\n&gt; mind =\r\nthat tells us what our dharma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of\n&gt; noise =\r\nfrom other parts of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get\n&gt; confu=\r\nsed.\n&gt; \n&gt; We should make the best judgment combining discrimination and int=\r\nuition and\n&gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be e=\r\nrr, but doing\n&gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; \n&gt; More than follo=\r\nwing dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in\n&gt; actions without=\r\n identification. *That* alone ensures that we are not\n&gt; accumulating new ka=\r\nrmas, i.e. not increasing the load. We should not build\n&gt; too much attachme=\r\nnt to what we are doing. We should engage in the best\n&gt; possible actions (b=\r\nased on our best judgment on what our dharma in the given\n&gt; situation is), =\r\nwith as little attachment and self-identification with the\n&gt; action as poss=\r\nible. When the action is finished, we should leave the result\n&gt; to god. We =\r\nshould not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt; work&quot; etc. =\r\nSuch adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through\n&gt; untached action=\r\n) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly.\n&gt; As we become=\r\n purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma clearer.\n&gt; There is =\r\na positive feedback here. This will slowly enable us to see our\n&gt; dharma cl=\r\nearly and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not easy,\n&gt; but n=\r\not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; \n&gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not=\r\n following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s sense of\n&gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined =\r\nwith time if one engages in action with\n&gt; little attachment.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs.\n&gt;=\r\n Another external input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can=\r\n\n&gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritu=\r\nal\n&gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the word=\r\ns of\n&gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; \n&gt; W=\r\nhen Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing gurus=\r\n\n&gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a guru in Krishna who clarified his=\r\n\n&gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami Vivekananda) was confused about his dha=\r\nrma\n&gt; and wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do sad=\r\nhana,\n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the=\r\n material\n&gt; world and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; \n&gt; One who is not in=\r\n tune with nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s\n&gt; debts are and =\r\nwhat nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what\n&gt; one&#39;s dharma=\r\n is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into\n&gt; one&#39;s in=\r\nner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Bottomline=\r\n is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and\n&gt; declare th=\r\nat as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, from\n&gt; time to =\r\ntime and from place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to find\n&gt; out w=\r\nhat one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding of one&#39;s\n&gt; dha=\r\nrma by increasing internal purity. By doing various kinds of spiritual\n&gt; sa=\r\ndhana (like homam, japam etc) and engaging in actions without much\n&gt; attach=\r\nment, one can slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of\n&gt; one=\r\n&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; \n&gt; -------\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good a=\r\nnd evil is bound to persist so long as one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakris=\r\nhna Paramahamsa\n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Aditi Banerjee &lt;baner=\r\njeea@gmail. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;I agree with Dinesh. Only very advanced =\r\nsadhakas will be able to identify rnas / karmic debts and know how/where/wh=\r\ny they are to be paid off. The rest of us have to follow dharma, which incl=\r\nudes standing up for what is right and righteous and not being defeatist or=\r\n fatalistic. Otherwise, Arjuna could have written off the wrongs of the Kau=\r\nravas as a massive rnu, but of course, Krishna urged him to take up the dha=\r\nrma of kshatriyahood and slay without mercy. The webs of karma are too intr=\r\nicate and complex and delicate to be comprehended unless one has reached ce=\r\nrtain very very high levels of spiritual attainment, and even then, it will=\r\n only be a partial vision.

One of the names of Lord Shiva is=\r\n Aghora. A true=C3=82 Aghora (aghori) does not see anything as terrible or =\r\nbad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestations of god and tries t=\r\no focus the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (god) always, instead=\r\n of impermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nWhen someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while carryin=\r\ng the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama is tru=\r\ne and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself that l=\r\nife and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real. But =\r\nthe question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth only=\r\n when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thing we=\r\n have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ourselve=\r\ns &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises are temporary il=\r\nlusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusio=\r\nns&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want to get it, can&#39;=\r\nt we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems beautiful =\r\nand other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary illusions. Only t=\r\nhe Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary\n&gt;  illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sa=\r\nd or angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai.

His mind rejects all *impermanent ma=\r\nnifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on them by classifying them as=\r\n pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking about them with attraction/=\r\naversion ) and tries to find and focus on what is permanent. But he takes i=\r\nt to extremes.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =\r\n=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82  *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we pe=\r\nrceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practically. If feces and frui=\r\nt are both impermenant illusions and the only permanent reality within them=\r\n is the Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may tr=\r\ny a ritual where feces is eaten.=C3=82 But, please remember that eating fec=\r\nes is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and no=\r\nt perceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is th=\r\ne main point. For example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for=\r\n such a person&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self =\r\n(&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the=\r\n mind will not be dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certa=\r\nin properties and will not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking th=\r\nat he is Self and he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of=\r\n course, a vedantin also has the same notions really. He chants vedic verse=\r\ns when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Se=\r\nlf&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not be fully ab=\r\nsorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant=\r\n manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;=\r\na overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Sel=\r\nf).\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are =\r\ntelling themselves the same truth and trying to absorb that truth into ever=\r\ny thought and impulse. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme situatio=\r\nn where failure results in a very bad dual experience. That can in fact wor=\r\nk as an incentive in forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a per=\r\nson who chants a Vedic verse that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; =\r\nand eats tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to abs=\r\norb the mind in Self while eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the=\r\n nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big=\r\n deal? On the other hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on=\r\n the taste of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure =\r\nresults in a very bad dual experience may act as an incentive in succeeding=\r\n quickly.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cann=\r\not necessarily be accomplished by everyone merely because of an incentive. =\r\nNot everyone trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Take=\r\n another simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, like ja=\r\npam and homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwe=\r\nlling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that i=\r\ns causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away f=\r\nrom sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts=\r\n. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if one kee=\r\nps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the=\r\n mind does not return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fasc=\r\nination some minds may have for sex?\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; An=\r\n aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root cause and r=\r\nemove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two =\r\ndifferent activities (one pure and the other impure), he may combine them i=\r\nnto one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits=\r\n naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does his japam. I=\r\nn the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may think that hi=\r\ns sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam like t=\r\nhat for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may =\r\nno longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no longer feel tit=\r\nillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex may be brok=\r\nen down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no longer evoke t=\r\nhoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small thoughts relate=\r\nd to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to\n&gt;  denser and\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, =\r\nbut they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much t=\r\nime in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill=\r\n mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the p=\r\nerson&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experi=\r\nences and the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break d=\r\nown some of these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermin=\r\ne those structures.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, is this a =\r\nfool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible that the person keeps on=\r\n engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex everytime he sit=\r\ns for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he sees naked=\r\n partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82 Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head on a=\r\nnd sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may push =\r\nthe problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a =\r\nrisky strategy is not applicable to all.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *=C3=82 =C3=\r\n=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82 =C3=82  *\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 Like Manish said i=\r\nn a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a =\r\npractical way to understand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by=\r\n setting up a high stakes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable f=\r\nor all and many may feel aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel a=\r\nttraction for it based on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an unde=\r\nrstanding brings.=C3=82 Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, t=\r\nhough it *may* attract some people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The =\r\nbasic tenets of Aghora and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora trie=\r\ns to accelerates how one absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making fa=\r\nilure very unpleasant.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; BTW, the followi=\r\nng mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths and explains the b=\r\nasic reality.

For=C3=\r\n=82 instance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great composer (one of the=\r\n Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry),=\r\n who was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis=\r\n=C3=82 mention=C3=82  great details about all the=C3=82 nine avaranas and d=\r\nifferent forms of the divine mother as one goes through each avarana.=C3=82=\r\n In the Dhyana Krithi=C3=82 of those, in the very=C3=82 first line he says,=\r\n &#39;Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;.=C3=82 That line tells me that=\r\n=C3=82 even through Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form.=C3=\r\n=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; So my question was in that perspec=\r\ntive. Anyway, your reply was a great one in which you mentioned how the Sel=\r\nf is surrounded by layers of duality! I never thought in those terms. \n&gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I have started reading Durga Saptashati, ju=\r\nst to get practise of reading it fluently, before I start to do chandi homa=\r\nm, which I plan to do during navaratri of 2010.

THEY are =\r\ndoing Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours now.

In general, it is a good idea=\r\n to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead o=\r\nf splitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, i=\r\nt is better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten =\r\nplaces, if one wants to find water.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; One possib=\r\nility is to do a homam and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with =\r\nvarious mantras one is attached to.\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; I am not that knowledg=\r\neable about Sri Vidya. However, from the little I have been exposed to, Sre=\r\ne chakra is a symblic representation of the layers of duality surrounding S=\r\nelf.
