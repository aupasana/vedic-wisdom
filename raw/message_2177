With its light and heat =\r\nall activities ensue\non earth and many resources are unearthed. In comparis=\r\non to other planets\nand satellites of the solar system it is our earth that=\r\n is most influenced\nby the sun with reference to the atmosphere, plants and=\r\n other beings. It is\nthe very life bestowing force on our globe. By correla=\r\nting the activities of\ndaily living everyone can experience the amount of i=\r\nnfluence of its\nrising/setting, dawn and noon and the state of earth=92s de=\r\nnizens. It is the\nsun that heralds in change in seasons. All this is experi=\r\nenced under normal\nsolar conditions but whenever a deviation sets in condit=\r\nions of calamities\n(earthquakes, tsunamis etc) ensue and thus normalcy and =\r\nbalance are\noverthrown. Thus not only the condition of earth goes awry but =\r\nthat there is\nchaos in the psyche of all beings especially humans and they =\r\nact so\ndisgracefully which is beyond the ken of ones imagination.\n\nThese da=\r\nys such activities are seen in the sun which can be called ordinary\nand yet=\r\n the reaction is such that it influences all living beings. Amongst\nthem is=\r\n the augmenting of sun spots which greatly influence earth denizens.\n\nAccor=\r\nding to research scientists of high repute when ever these sun spots\nmanife=\r\nst in the sun its state becomes extraordinary. Darkness and storms\nerupt in=\r\n regions spanning thousands of miles, flames are ablaze and\nelectromagnetic=\r\n waves manifest so speedily that the entire solar system gets\ninfluenced. T=\r\nhere exists a special bond of give and take between the earth\nand sun and h=\r\nence there is a greater probability of adversity ensuing.\nOrdinary conditio=\r\nns change and such adverse conditions set in which induce\nmore calamities t=\r\nhan benefits. Seasons become colder, snowing is in excess,\nstorms lash out =\r\nand greater atmospheric pressure erupts as cyclones. In the\nozone layer the=\r\nre is less oxygen. In Indian Astrology the manifestation of\nsun spots is an=\r\n indication of change in which both good and bad things can\noccur. Even mod=\r\nern science now agrees with this totally.\n\nA famous scientist Alexander Mar=\r\nshek in his book =91Earth and Horizon=92 has\nsaid that may be there is no p=\r\nerceivable connection between the activities\nof earth and internal chaos on=\r\n the sun yet from the statistical standpoint\nits connection has been proved=\r\n beyond doubt. It has been found that when\never these solar activities augm=\r\nent there is more rain and floods, plants\nbloom more, heat increases and fa=\r\nmine is seen, road accidents arise, space\naccidents augment and war and blo=\r\nodshed too is witnessed. At such times not\nonly earthquakes and fire outbur=\r\nsts are seen but also extraordinary radiance\nof Meru light is glimpsed. Thi=\r\ns too indeed influences our day to day living.\nAmerica=92s weather scientis=\r\nt Dr Waxler termed this as a deep interruption in\nman=92s daily life.\n\nWhat=\r\n is the influence of changes taking place on the sun on our earth? To\nknow =\r\nthis Russia=92s scientist of fame Chibosky has studied the history of\npast =\r\n400 years as far as solar activities are concerned. He has concluded\nthat t=\r\nhere is a strong connection between various types of epidemics and\nchanges =\r\nand sun spot activities. This is a scientific fact that after every\n11 year=\r\ns sun spots augment a great deal. As long as the sun spots are deep\nor shal=\r\nlow its ratio induces changes on earth. Apart from this due to sun\nspots th=\r\ne earth=92s magnetic field too remains imbalanced. Radio transmission\nis ob=\r\nstructed and weather gets influenced too. A famous scientist Michaelson\nopi=\r\nnes to this extent that due to these changes on special occasions the\nearth=\r\n tends to expand and contract too as a result of which earthquakes and\nothe=\r\nr calamities ensue. Another well known American scientist Dr Andrew\nDouglas=\r\n says that sun spots not only influence human beings and smaller life\nforms=\r\n but that even plants get influenced. After every 11 years the annual\nring =\r\nof trees widens. Possibly this happens because in those days in order\nto st=\r\nay away from the subtle rays of sun spots nature makes tree trunks\nlarger i=\r\nn diameter.\n\nAmerica=92s Atomic Energy Commission, whose scientists work in=\r\n the Sandia lab\nof Albuquerque has researched a great deal on solar influen=\r\nces. They have\namassed statistics of 20 years of crime and accidents and an=\r\nalyzed them.\nOver and above this they concluded that when sun spots are at =\r\ntheir pinnacle\naccidents and crimes augment 6-fold. Even New York=92s Dr Ba=\r\nker has found that\nduring intense solar movements there is an increase in p=\r\natients with\npsychological ailments. With reference to this, ancient Indian=\r\n Astrologers\nhad found out much beforehand as to what is the nature of thes=\r\ne outbursts in\nthe solar system. What are its causes and what is the influe=\r\nnce of earth and\nits surroundings? With reference to these outbursts at the=\r\n level of super\nconsciousness Maharshi Garg, Parashar, Kashyap, Deva, Narad=\r\na and Vasishtha\nconducted profound studies.\n\nIn these days space scientists=\r\n are supervising the solar system and the\ninterstellar space beyond it. The=\r\ny say that present day solar activities are\ngoing to induce dire conditions=\r\n on earth. Everyone knows that the earth has\nto imbibe more energy from oth=\r\ner extra terrestrial regions than what itself\npossesses. Solar energy is it=\r\ns very life force and right from ancient times\nit has been accepted that be=\r\nings sustain on earth because of sun=92s grace. In\nEgypt during irrigation =\r\na festival is conducted since time immemorial. This\nfestival takes place in=\r\n the month of July when the Nile River gets flooded.\nAfter deep research it=\r\n was found that floods occur on that very day when the\nLubdhak Star (in the=\r\n Northern Hemisphere) is seen at sunrise. This means\nthat in some way or th=\r\ne other changes in River Nile are connected to solar\nactivities.\n\nAccording=\r\n to great scientists sun spots reappear after every 11 years 1month\nand 22 =\r\nyears 2 months. As a result a chaos occurs on earth. When sun spots\nmanifes=\r\nt the sun shines brightly which is called Solar Flare and many\nparticles ar=\r\ne emitted from it slowly or speedily. The ones that are emitted\nfast have i=\r\nnfinite energy. These particles cross the ozone layer and contact\nour earth=\r\n, which as a result influence the psyche of human beings. It is\nseen that w=\r\nhen sun spots increase and particles of its Solar Flare contact\nhuman being=\r\ns the latter=92s psychology is affected. Due to their influence\neven great =\r\nmen are affected and various types of situations pan out on\nearth.\n\nWhen ev=\r\ner sun spots augment in number not only individuals but that an all\npervasi=\r\nve effect of solar activities is noted on world humanity. World\nhistory res=\r\nearch says that right from the 18th century to this day this fact\nis clear =\r\nthat important historical revolutions, bloodshed, warfare etc have\noccurred=\r\n during sun spot manifestations.\n\nResearch scientists have unveiled this am=\r\nazing data that there is a strong\nconnection with incidents of human civili=\r\nzation history. In the year sun\nspots augment rapidly life becomes extraord=\r\ninary on earth. At such times\nthere have been wars, revolutions etc. In the=\r\n year 1789 AD the French\nRevolution, the first battle of India=92s Independ=\r\nence struggle in 1857 AD,\nbattle between Russia and Japan in 1904-1905, 1st=\r\n world war in 1914-18, 2nd\nworld war in 1939-42, India=92s Independence in =\r\n1947 etc took place when sun\nspots were phenomenally on the rise. After tha=\r\nt 3 important years of sun\nspot augmenting passed by in 1958, 1969 and 1980=\r\n-81. A new phase started in\n1992-93 and in future when total solar eclipse =\r\nwill take place sun spots\nwill rapidly manifest. It has been calculated tha=\r\nt the disorder and nature=92s\nwrath will be that much more terrible and it =\r\nis said that the last 8 years\nof the 20th century will be more tortuous and=\r\n full of changes (this\nliterature was written before 1991 AD).\n\nSpiritual s=\r\neers opine that in accordance with the wheel of time the coming\ndays will b=\r\ne full of speedy changes in an all round manner. For some unknown\nreasons i=\r\nn the coming days the sun will break certain cosmic laws and induce\nchanges=\r\n on planet earth. Not only will there be floods, famine, world wars,\nepidem=\r\nics etc but new revolutions will set in and a change for the better\nwill be=\r\n noted in the so far lowly human intellect. The sun is just not the\nlife of=\r\n the material world but is also the Lord of human consciousness.\nRishis cal=\r\nl it 3-fold knowledge meaning that 3 principles exist in it viz.\ngross one =\r\nwhich constitutes the human body, vital body from which\nconsciousness manif=\r\nests and mind which induces other inner activities. Since\ntime immemorial t=\r\nhe Gayatri Mantra has been chanted for activation of human\npower consciousn=\r\ness so as to render a cosmic transformation. In the coming\ndays the world o=\r\nver this experiment shall intensify with great momentum.\n\n\n\nAuthor : Pt.
