Thanks for the nice quote from Ramak=\r\nrishna.\n \nThough individual will (or free will) is non-existent from the pe=\r\nrspective of a realized soul, it does exist for one who has an individual s=\r\nelf-awareness (I-ness) that is limited to a body. One can do whatever one w=\r\nants - good and bad - and declare at the end like a great philosopher, &quot;god=\r\n did it through me&quot;. But, the fact is that god did it through him, through =\r\nhis individual I-ness. The fruits of the action will be reaped by his indiv=\r\nidual I-ness in future. If the fruits are very unpleasant, one may feel gre=\r\nat pain. One will not then think &quot;god is doing things through me and god is=\r\n experiencing this pain through me&quot;. Instead, one will cry out loud, &quot;I am =\r\nin pain&quot;! Until one severs individual I-ness completely, there is no point =\r\nin rhetorical declarations of god doing everything.\n \nI have seen some Indi=\r\nan movies in which the villain quotes Bhagavad Gita and declares &quot;I am not =\r\nthe doer. Krishna is the doer. He is doing this through me&quot; and then goes o=\r\nn to do evil acts. That is not the correct attitude. If everyone entertains=\r\n that attitude and does whatever one wants, there will be more sin in the w=\r\norld as Ramakrishna correctly said below.\n \nAs long as one has invidiaul I-=\r\nness, one will continue to be held responsible for actions committed by tha=\r\nt I-ness and reap the good and bad fruits (and be born many times if needed=\r\n). Only when that individual I-ness completely melts can one actually exper=\r\nience what Ramakrishna said below and remain pure, untouched by the actions=\r\n committed.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.o=\r\nrg/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jy=\r\notish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish softwa=\r\nre (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n-----------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------- \n \n----- Original Message -----  \n \nWhen I first =\r\nread what you wrote below, understood the theory but still didn&#39;t &quot;get it&quot;,=\r\n like you had warned. Then I read this:\n-----------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n&quot;Vaidyanath - Sir, I have a doubt about what they call free=\r\n will. Sometimes I wonder if it is true that I can do a good act as well as=\r\n a bad one. Do we really have free will?\n \nSri Ramakrishna - Everything is =\r\nunder the Lord&#39;s control - it is all His lila (divine sport). He has create=\r\nd a variety of things: small, big, powerful, weak, good and bad. Whether a =\r\nman is good or bad is all His maya, His sport. Don&#39;t you see that all the t=\r\nrees in the garden are not alike?\n \n&quot;Till one has realized God, one enterta=\r\nins the feeling that one is free to act. This illusion is also created by H=\r\nim. If man did not feel that he had free will, there would be much more sin=\r\n. If sin entailed no punishment, one would have no fear of it.\n \n&quot;Do you kn=\r\now how one feels when one has realized the Lord? It is like this: I am a ma=\r\nchine, You are the operator; I am the home, You are the mistress of the hom=\r\ne. I am a chariot and You are the charioteer. I move the way You make me mo=\r\nve.

Suddenly thing=\r\ns made a lot more sense. Thanks.\n \nBest,\n&lt;deleted&gt;\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@ya=\r\nhoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

It is either this or that.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both are correct, but at=\r\n different levels. I will elaborate. However, this is philosophically compl=\r\nex and those who do not follow what I say should not worry at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; *  =\r\n      *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Non-dual self has no division of self into various ob=\r\njects or space or time. There is no concept of time or space or space-time =\r\ncontinuum within non-dual self. A yogi absorbed in non-dual self has no sen=\r\nse of space or time or objectification.\n&gt; \n&gt; Supreme cosmic being is the li=\r\nnk between duality and non-duality. Supreme cosmic being arising in this no=\r\nn-dual self captures the entire field of duality within Him. All beings, en=\r\ntire space and all space-time continua within the field of duality exist wi=\r\nthin Him. From the perspective of supreme cosmic being, all beings of the d=\r\nual world are His parts and all their individual wills are parts of His cos=\r\nmic will. As all space-time continua are within Him, there is nothing that =\r\nis unknown to Him. Past, present and future; here, there and everywhere; I,=\r\n you and others, this possibility, that possibility and yet another possibi=\r\nlity - all are accessible and fully &quot;known&quot; to His self-awareness.\n&gt; \n&gt; Now=\r\n, let us come lower and into the field of duality. The field of duality con=\r\nsists of infinite divisions of space, time and space-time continua. There a=\r\nre infinite possibilities within this field.\n&gt; \n&gt; Normally, people stuck de=\r\neply within duality have a linear sense of time and perceive just a part of=\r\n one space-time continuum. However, field of duality also contains planes o=\r\nf consciousness where different senses of time and different space-time con=\r\ntinua (that may intersect at various points) exist. A yogi who experiences =\r\nsuch a space-time continuum in such a plane of consciousness may experience=\r\n a point of time that maps to a future time in a regular space-time continu=\r\num being experienced by you. Also, what is 1 minute in one space-time conti=\r\nnuum may be 1 year in another space-time continuum. Time is not as straight=\r\n-forward an entity as one may think. Basically, the field of duality contai=\r\nns infinite space-time continua and what one experiences depends on the pla=\r\nne of consciousness that one&#39;s self-awareness (Kundalini) is in. But, most =\r\nof us experience part of a specific space-time continuum and hence think th=\r\nat that is the only reality. But relaity consists of infinite space-time co=\r\nntinua that intersect each other. These are all different possibilities and=\r\n you chart out your course based on your actions and Nature&#39;s reactions to =\r\nyour actions.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; From the perspective of a yogi =\r\nwho is in a different space-time continuum, your state may be known at a ti=\r\nme that is in &quot;future&quot; as per the space-time continuum in which you exist. =\r\nBut, from the perspective of the space-time continuum that you are in, your=\r\n state at that future time is not yet known and depends on your current act=\r\nion.\n&gt; \n&gt; If a yogi in a different space-time continuum has seen your state=\r\n in future, his observation is merely an observation and from his reference=\r\n frame. It has no causal relationship to your current action or your future=\r\n state. He is merely an observer and he does not cause anything to happen. =\r\nHis observation is specific to some space-time pairs and does not cover all=\r\n the space-time pairs that you will traverse as you travel to reach the spa=\r\nce-time pair where he observed you (if at all you do!).\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *    =\r\n    *\n&gt; \n&gt; Let us go further. Is there only one future possible for you? Or=\r\n, does the path traversed by you in space-time continuum not fixed but vari=\r\nable based on your actions? Can your actions at important cross-roads alter=\r\n the course you traverse?\n&gt; \n&gt; If so, what is the meaning of a yogi observi=\r\nng you at a space-time pair? Is his observation only a possibility or a cer=\r\ntainty? One may say &quot;how can one observe a possibility? Anything we observe=\r\n must be a certainty.&quot; But is that correct? Aren&#39;t the field of duality and=\r\n the infinite space-time continua contained in it merely a set of infinite =\r\npossibilities?\n&gt; \n&gt; Some great rishis can see not just a space-time pair, b=\r\nut many space-time continua at the same time, i.e. they can see various pos=\r\nsibilities based on various possible actions. However, visions seen by most=\r\n yogis about &quot;future&quot; are just one possibility.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Bottomline: At the level at which we exist, there is certainly something=\r\n called &quot;freewill&quot;. Within the limits imposed by the reactions given by nat=\r\nure to your own previous actions, you do have a scope for engaging in diffe=\r\nrent actions at this time. Depending on which action you engage in, the fut=\r\nure can be slightly different. Some actions can even make the future signif=\r\nicantly different. A rishi may be able to chart out a significant portion o=\r\nf the field of possibilities for future (e.g. like a brilliant chess player=\r\n figuring out most possibilities upto 20 moves from now). An advanced yogi =\r\nmay be able to see a few possibilities for future (e.g. like a good chess p=\r\nlayer figuring out a few moves or guessing a future position). But the supr=\r\neme cosmic being knows the entire field of possibilities, as they all exist=\r\n within Him.\n&gt; \n&gt; However, your actions are what bring to fruition (w.r.t. =\r\nthe reference frame of your consciousness!) some of those possibilities. On=\r\ne may know all the possibilities quite deeply and even guess the possibilit=\r\ny that will come to fruition, but it is your actions that actually make som=\r\ne of those possibilities a reality.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short H=\r\nomam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas You=\r\nrself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups=\r\n.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicast=\r\nro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstr=\r\nologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.or=\r\ng\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: rajarshi nandy \n&gt;   To: vedic-w=\r\nisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, June 30, 2009 5:22 AM\n&gt;   Subject=\r\n: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Freewill.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Namaste Narasimhaji\n&gt; \n&gt;       =\r\n  No doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail for all of us, however, I could n=\r\not help it that an inevitable question popped up in my mind. One of the oft=\r\n discussed and eternal questions.\n&gt; \n&gt;         If events have already been =\r\ncreated like in a movie and later as time unfolds, they happen in our plane=\r\n of existence, then all talk of freewill must be humbug? Like a placebo tha=\r\nt makes us &quot;happy&quot; but in reality does not exist!\n&gt; \n&gt;         I am not que=\r\nstioning that what you wrote in the mail about events having already happen=\r\ned, because same has been said by other great spiritual people in the world=\r\n. \n&gt; \n&gt;         But my question is because I cannot reconcile this with a f=\r\nreewill. Both cannot be correct. It is either this or that.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Th=\r\neoritically speaking, say tomorrow suddenly majority of the world reforms i=\r\ntself, does a self correction exercise and brings in peace, harmony etc etc=\r\n, then why should the Kalki Avatar still incarnate? But then if the Kalki A=\r\nvatar has to incarnate - as our texts say - then such a self correcting opt=\r\nion is already negated out.\n&gt; \n&gt;         Well, theoritically, in a very lar=\r\nge viewpoint no one has any choice in the sense that finally everyone will =\r\nend up merging with the divine.\n&gt; \n&gt;         So I guess freewill is not rea=\r\nlly as free as we love to think.\n&gt; \n&gt;         -Regards\n&gt;          Rajarshi\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt;         The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n        --- On Tue, 30/6/09, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;       =\r\n    From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt;           Subject: [vedic-wisdom] M=\r\niscellany: Future, bestest homam, purity and overcoming ego\n&gt;           To:=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;           Date: Tuesday, 30 June, 2009, 6:0=\r\n1 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;           Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt;           I mentioned an episode of a =\r\nsmall boy who did a very short Chandi homam and saw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnatio=\r\nns above the fire in the following mail:\n&gt; \n&gt;           http://groups. yaho=\r\no.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 761\n&gt; \n&gt;           This boy was born an=\r\nd brought up in US and is not proficient in his knowledge of Hinduism. He d=\r\nid not know much about some of the ten incarnations. He described what he s=\r\naw and I told him who was who and a little about them. One of the forms he =\r\nsaw was a radiant man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty ro=\r\nad. I told him he was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt; \n&gt;           * * *\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;           This boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when=\r\n I was with him one morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This w=\r\nas abou a week after the episode mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt; \n&gt;         =\r\n  I asked what he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is not that the future that is=\r\n to come has not already happened. It has already happened in reality, but =\r\nit will happen later when the time comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I guessed =\r\nwhat he was getting at, but pretended not to know. I said, &quot;no. What do you=\r\n mean?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;           He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking=\r\n.&quot; This boy is not known to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main c=\r\nharacteristic is that he is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, content=\r\ned and relaxed. However, he was onto something today. But he could not expr=\r\ness himself.\n&gt; \n&gt;           I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future h=\r\nas already happened at some level, but will reveal itself to people later? =\r\nKind of like a movie. A movie may have been shot and become ready in a stud=\r\nio. Some people may have already seen it. But people seeing it on the scree=\r\nn later will think it is happening in front of them. Are you saying somethi=\r\nng like that?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;           He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am say=\r\ning. If something is going to happen in future, it will happen when future =\r\ncomes. But somebody may be able to see it before future comes, because it h=\r\nas already happened.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;           Though he did not mention it, I knew w=\r\nhy he was thinking along these lines. When I told him the man riding the ho=\r\nrse in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was pr=\r\nobably confused. Given his age and ability to think and understand things, =\r\nthis probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see somebody who =\r\nhad not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible and came to=\r\n some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Tim=\r\ne seems linear at the level of regular consciousness. However, in many plan=\r\nes of conssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It even loses it=\r\ns meaning when one is established in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;           * * *\n&gt; \n&gt;           The same boy once performed a very short =\r\nKaali homam with a small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara a=\r\ndded before name. When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very =\r\nintense and powerful energy. It was quite different from the energy I feel =\r\nnormally. This intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blissful and =\r\na feeling that can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am done here. I have=\r\n nothing more left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire consciousnss.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt;           I had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice before =\r\nthat. Once I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting next=\r\n to my guru Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second time was w=\r\nhen I had an unexpected opportunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a=\r\n famous temple, standing within 3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, whic=\r\nh was sanctified and worshipped by a great saint in the past. The energy I =\r\nfelt was the same on all the three occasions. At no other time did I feel t=\r\nhat intense shakti.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Interestingly, after we finished meditat=\r\nion and opened eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I d=\r\nid so far, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t k=\r\nnow how to say it, but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;           =\r\n* * *\n&gt; \n&gt;           This boy performed a really simple and short procedure=\r\n, shorter than what I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful=\r\n in making a powerful energy manifest there. The bottomline is that interna=\r\nl purity is the most important thing.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Rituals help purify on=\r\ne and purity helps one do a ritual better and get more out of it. It is an =\r\negg and chicken problem and one has to keep doing it until one breaks throu=\r\ngh.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Keep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do =\r\npay attention to internal purity as you engage in external practices. The o=\r\nnly worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how smaller your=\r\n ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist attraction to external=\r\n things better and you can resist internal enemies like lust, anger, jealos=\r\ny etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I=\r\n&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of all problems.\n&gt; \n&gt;           * =\r\n* *\n&gt; \n&gt;           Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challengi=\r\nng, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you - includin=\r\ng your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body - is god&#39;s pr=\r\noperty and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of these properties of=\r\n god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining the notion &quot;this is=\r\n mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care of his master&#39;s properties,=\r\n but without thinking of all those things as his or her belongings.\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n        Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for taki=\r\nng good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes the best care =\r\nof things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a servant does not =\r\nwaste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept that is master&#39;s prop=\r\nerty and can be taken away anytime. This enables one to do the best job wit=\r\nh what one possesses and not worry about what one does not possess or what =\r\nis out of one&#39;s control.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Developing the attitude of a servan=\r\nt who takes care of master&#39;s properties will help one wade the ocean of wor=\r\nldly life without getting caught and overcome ego.\n&gt; \n&gt;           Best rega=\r\nrds,\n&gt;           Narasimha\n&gt;           ------------ --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- -\n&gt;           Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt;           Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt;           Spirituality: http://grou=\r\nps. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;           Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): =\r\nhttp://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt;           Free Jyotish software (Win=\r\ndows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt;           Sri Jagannath Centre (SJ=\r\nC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt;           ------------ ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0110_01CA04DE.1A705260\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3562&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial s=\r\nize=3D2&gt;I am forwarding this to the list without revealing \nyour name, so t=\r\nhat others can also benefit from it.

Do we really have=\r\n free \nwill?&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Ramakrishna - Everything is under the Lord&#39;s =\r\ncontrol - it \nis all His lila (divine sport). He has created a variety of t=\r\nhings: small, big, \npowerful, weak, good and bad. Whether a man is good or =\r\nbad is all His maya, His \nsport. Don&#39;t you see that all the trees in the ga=\r\nrden are not \nalike?&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Till one has realized God, one entertain=\r\ns the feeling that \none is free to act.

There=\r\n is no concept \nof time or space or space-time continuum within non-dual se=\r\nlf. A yogi absorbed \nin non-dual self has no sense of space or time or obje=\r\nctification.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Supreme cosmic being is the link between dua=\r\nlity and non-duality. \nSupreme cosmic being arising in this non-dual self c=\r\naptures the entire field of \nduality within Him. All beings, entire space a=\r\nnd all space-time continua within \nthe field of duality exist within Him. F=\r\nrom the perspective of supreme cosmic \nbeing, all beings of the dual world =\r\nare His parts and all their individual wills \nare parts of His cosmic will.=\r\n As all space-time continua are within Him, there \nis nothing that is unkno=\r\nwn to Him. Past, present and future; here, there and \neverywhere; I, you an=\r\nd others, this possibility, that possibility and yet \nanother possibility -=\r\n all are accessible and fully &quot;known&quot; to His \nself-awareness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Now, let us come lower and into the field of \nduality. The field of dua=\r\nlity consists of infinite divisions of space, time and \nspace-time continua=\r\n. There are infinite possibilities within this field.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nor=\r\nmally, people stuck deeply within duality have a linear sense of \ntime and =\r\nperceive just a part of one space-time continuum. However, field of \ndualit=\r\ny also contains planes of consciousness where different senses of time and =\r\n\ndifferent space-time continua (that may intersect at various points) exist=\r\n. A \nyogi who experiences such a space-time continuum in such a plane of \nc=\r\nonsciousness may experience a point of time that maps to a future time in a=\r\n \nregular space-time continuum being experienced by you. Also, what is 1 mi=\r\nnute in \none space-time continuum may be 1 year in another space-time conti=\r\nnuum. Time is \nnot as straight-forward an entity as one may think. Basicall=\r\ny, the field of \nduality contains infinite space-time continua and what one=\r\n experiences depends \non the plane of consciousness that one&#39;s self-awarene=\r\nss (Kundalini) is in. But, \nmost of us experience part of a specific space-=\r\ntime continuum and hence think \nthat that is the only reality. But relaity =\r\nconsists of infinite space-time \ncontinua that intersect each other. These =\r\nare all different possibilities and \nyou chart out your course based on you=\r\nr actions and Nature&#39;s reactions to your \nactions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From the \nperspective of a yogi who is in a diffe=\r\nrent space-time continuum, your state may \nbe known at a time that is in &quot;f=\r\nuture&quot; as per the space-time continuum in which \nyou exist. But, from the p=\r\nerspective of the space-time continuum that you are \nin, your state at that=\r\n future time is not yet known and depends on your current \naction.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If a yogi in a different space-time continuum has seen \nyour state=\r\n in future, his observation is merely an observation and from his \nreferenc=\r\ne frame. It has no causal relationship to your current action or your \nfutu=\r\nre state. He is merely an observer and he does not cause anything to happen=\r\n. \nHis observation is specific to some space-time pairs and does not cover =\r\nall the \nspace-time pairs that you will traverse as you travel to reach the=\r\n space-time \npair where he observed you (if at all you do!).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let us go \nfurther. Is there only one =\r\nfuture possible for you? Or, does the path traversed \nby you in space-time =\r\ncontinuum not fixed but variable based on your actions? Can \nyour actions a=\r\nt important cross-roads alter the course you traverse?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; If=\r\n so, what is the meaning of a yogi observing you at a space-time \npair? Is =\r\nhis observation only a possibility or a certainty? One may say &quot;how can \non=\r\ne observe a possibility? Anything we observe must be a certainty.&quot; But is t=\r\nhat \ncorrect? Aren&#39;t the field of duality and the infinite space-time conti=\r\nnua \ncontained in it merely a set of infinite possibilities?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Some \ngreat rishis can see not just a space-time pair, but many space-ti=\r\nme continua at \nthe same time, i.e. they can see various possibilities base=\r\nd on various possible \nactions. However, visions seen by most yogis about &quot;=\r\nfuture&quot; are just one \npossibility.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bottomline: At \nthe level at which we exist, there is certainly s=\r\nomething called &quot;freewill&quot;. \nWithin the limits imposed by the reactions giv=\r\nen by nature to your own previous \nactions, you do have a scope for engagin=\r\ng in different actions at this time. \nDepending on which action you engage =\r\nin, the future can be slightly different. \nSome actions can even make the f=\r\nuture significantly different. A rishi may be \nable to chart out a signific=\r\nant portion of the field of possibilities for future \n(e.g. like a brillian=\r\nt chess player figuring out most possibilities upto 20 \nmoves from now). An=\r\n advanced yogi may be able to see a few possibilities for \nfuture (e.g. lik=\r\ne a good chess player figuring out a few moves or guessing a \nfuture positi=\r\non). But the supreme cosmic being knows the entire field of \npossibilities,=\r\n as they all exist within Him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; However, your \nactions are =\r\nwhat bring to fruition (w.r.t. the reference frame of your \nconsciousness!)=\r\n some of those possibilities. One may know all the possibilities \nquite dee=\r\nply and even guess the possibility that will come to fruition, but it \nis y=\r\nour actions that actually make some of those possibilities a \nreality.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n---------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a \nShort Homam You=\r\nrself: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT=\r\n face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D=\r\n2&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-w=\r\nisdom&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons =\r\n(MP3): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D=\r\nArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt; \nSri Jagan=\r\nnath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagannath.org&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&gt; \n---------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; ----- Original Message=\r\n ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; From: \nrajarshi nandy &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; To: =\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \nhref=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial =\r\n\nsize=3D2&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D=\r\n2&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sent: Tuesday, June 30, 2009 5:22 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp; \nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Freewill.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Namaste \nNarasimhaji&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; No \ndoubt a wonderful and i=\r\nnspiring mail for all of us, however, I could not help it \nthat an inevitab=\r\nle question popped up in my mind.

He did not know much a=\r\nbout some of the ten incarnations. He described \nwhat he saw and I told him=\r\n who was who and a little about them. One of the forms \nhe saw was a radian=\r\nt man with white clothes riding a white horse on a dusty \nroad. I told him =\r\nhe was Kalki and he hadn&#39;t come yet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * \n*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \nThis boy is usually playf=\r\nul, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was with him \none morning, I saw hi=\r\nm lost in some serious thought. This was abou a week after \nthe episode men=\r\ntioned in the above mail.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I asked \nwhat he was thinking. He said, &quot;it is=\r\n not that the future that is to come has \nnot already happened. It has alre=\r\nady happened in reality, but it will happen \nlater when the time comes. You=\r\n know what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting \nat, but pretended not to=\r\n know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He said, &quot;I \ndon&#39;t know how to sa=\r\ny what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known to be overly \nintelligent or a=\r\nrticulate. His main characteristic is that he is usually \ncheerful, playful=\r\n, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However, he was onto \nsomething today=\r\n. But he could not express himself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I helped \nhim, &quot;do you mean to say t=\r\nhat future has already happened at some level, but \nwill reveal itself to p=\r\neople later? Kind of like a movie. A movie may have been \nshot and become r=\r\neady in a studio. Some people may have already seen it. But \npeople seeing =\r\nit on the screen later will think it is happening in front of \nthem. Are yo=\r\nu saying something like that?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He \nexclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I a=\r\nm saying. If something is going to happen \nin future, it will happen when f=\r\nuture comes. But somebody may be able to see it \nbefore future comes, becau=\r\nse it has already happened.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Though he \ndid not mention it, I knew why h=\r\ne was thinking along these lines. When I told \nhim the man riding the horse=\r\n in his vision over the fire was Kalki and he was \nyet to come, he was prob=\r\nably confused. Given his age and ability to think and \nunderstand things, t=\r\nhis probably seemed like an oddity to him that he should see \nsomebody who =\r\nhad not yet come. So he was trying to think how it was possible and \ncame t=\r\no some important conclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Time seems \nli=\r\nnear at the level of regular consciousness. However, in many planes of \ncon=\r\nssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It even loses its meaning=\r\n \nwhen one is established in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * \n*&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; \nThe same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small naama =\r\nmantra \nof Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When we were=\r\n meditating \nafter poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful energy. =\r\nIt was quite \ndifferent from the energy I feel normally. This intense energ=\r\ny made my mind feel \nsatisfied and blissful and a feeling that can be loose=\r\nly expressed in words as \n&quot;I am done here. I have nothing more left to do. =\r\nTime to leave&quot; filled my entire \nconsciousnss.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had \nexperienced the sa=\r\nme kind of intense energy twice before that. Once I \nexperienced the same e=\r\nnergy when I was meditating sitting next to my guru Manish \nwho was doing a=\r\n Chandi homam in India. Second time was when I had an unexpected \nopportuni=\r\nty to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous temple, standing \nwithin =\r\n3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, which was sanctified and \nworshipped=\r\n by a great saint in the past. The energy I felt was the same on all \nthe t=\r\nhree occasions. At no other time did I feel that intense shakti.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \nIntere=\r\nstingly, after we finished meditation and opened eyes, that boy remarked, \n=\r\n&quot;out of all the different homas I did so far, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I=\r\n \nasked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it, but it just felt awe=\r\nsome \nand different.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * \n*&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \nThis boy performed a really simple and s=\r\nhort procedure, shorter than what I give \nin manuals. But it seemed like he=\r\n was successful in making a powerful energy \nmanifest there. The bottomline=\r\n is that internal purity is the most important \nthing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Rituals \nhelp pur=\r\nify one and purity helps one do a ritual better and get more out of it. \nIt=\r\n is an egg and chicken problem and one has to keep doing it until one break=\r\ns \nthrough.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; Keep \nperforming your chosen spiritual practices, but do pay=\r\n attention to internal \npurity as you engage in external practices. The onl=\r\ny worthwhile measure of \nspiritual progress and purity is how smaller your =\r\nego becomes. As ego becomes \nsmaller, you can resist attraction to external=\r\n things better and you can resist \ninternal enemies like lust, anger, jealo=\r\nsy etc better. You can do your dharma \nbetter. Ego - thinking that this is =\r\n&quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause \nof all problems.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * * \n*&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \nO=\r\nvercoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively challenging, but bhakti yoga =\r\nis \neasier. Think that all that is around you - including your house, money=\r\n, cars, \nspouse, children and your own body - is god&#39;s property and that yo=\r\nu are a \ntemporary caretaker of all of these properties of god. Do the best=\r\n job you can, \nbut without entertaining the notion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithf=\r\nul servant takes \nvery good care of his master&#39;s properties, but without th=\r\ninking of all those \nthings as his or her belongings.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Realize \nthat thin=\r\nking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary for taking good care of them. \nA =\r\nservant who loves one&#39;s master takes the best care of things entrusted to o=\r\nne. \nWhen a thing is taken away, a servant does not waste time worrying and=\r\n crying. A \nservant will accept that is master&#39;s property and can be taken =\r\naway anytime. \nThis enables one to do the best job with what one possesses =\r\nand not worry about \nwhat one does not possess or what is out of one&#39;s cont=\r\nrol.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; Developing \nthe attitude of a servant who takes care of master&#39;s pr=\r\noperties will help one \nwade the ocean of worldly life without getting caug=\r\nht and overcome ego.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; \n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Best \nregards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \nNarasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- \n-&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do a Short \nHomam Yourself: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://w=\r\nww.VedicAst&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt; rologer.org/ \nhomam&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Do \nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicAst&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://www.Ved=\r\nicAst&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt; rologer.org/ \ntarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \nSpirituality: =\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \nsize=3D2&gt;http://groups=\r\n&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- \nwisdom&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Free \nJyo=\r\ntish lessons (MP3): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial=\r\n \nsize=3D2&gt;http://vedicastro&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;. home.c=\r\nomcast. \nnet&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; Free \nJyotish software (Windows): &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.VedicA=\r\nst&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT \nface=3DArial size=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT face=\r\n=3DArial size=3D2&gt; \nrologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.SriJagan&quot;&gt;&lt;FONT \nface=3DArial size=3D2&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;=\r\n/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt; \nnath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n------------ --------- ---------=\r\n --------- --------- --------- \n-&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0110_01CA04DE.1A705260--\r\n\n"}}
