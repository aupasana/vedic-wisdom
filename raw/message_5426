I am cc&#39;ing this response to vedic-wisdom ya=\r\nhoogroup, which is dedicated to this kind of spiritual discussions.\n \n*    =\r\n    *        *\n \n1. I have not read all &quot;religious books&quot; and I do not know=\r\n if there isn&#39;t a book that mentions these things as you claim.\n \nIn any ca=\r\nse, the purpose of scriptures is to teach lessons relevant to the inner dev=\r\nelopment and spiritual progress. Sometimes, metaphorical representations of=\r\n those inner lessons can take the form of stories. Stories may use characte=\r\nrs and situations prevalent in those times, but the essence of the story ma=\r\ny cover a timeless truth.\n \n2. The supreme cosmic being who created this un=\r\niverse is formless, but is the basis of all. No being can be, desire, know =\r\nor act independent of Him. He may be called by different names by different=\r\n people. What some seekers may have realized as Allah and what some seekers=\r\n may have realized as Holy Spirit, was called Narayana or Parama Purusha by=\r\n Vedic seers.\n \nSome may call the same liquid as &quot;water&quot;, some as &quot;paani&quot;, =\r\nsome as &quot;neellu&quot;, some as &quot;tanni&quot;, some &quot;jalam&quot; and so on. Yet, they mean t=\r\nhe same thing by it.\n \nOf course, there may be different flavors of it, lik=\r\ne plain water, flavored water, mineral water, soft drink, lemonade etc. But=\r\n, someone may say that only plain water is good and ban all other kinds of =\r\nwater. Similarly, god may be worshipped as Supreme Cosmic Being as well as =\r\ndeities with various qualities (e.g. Hinduism), while some may worship only=\r\n the supreme cosmic being and ban other worships.\n \nIf you ignore names and=\r\n dwell into the essence, there are many similarities between religions. Obv=\r\niously, all beings have access to the same inner realization. Religions est=\r\nablished by one (or a handful of) prophets may have been limited by the abi=\r\nlity of those persons in accessing the highest truths and limited by the ab=\r\nility of later people to understand and pass on the original teachings. Hen=\r\nce they may only be partially correct. Religions established and refined by=\r\n a living stream of seekers (like Hinduism) are give the most complete pict=\r\nure.\n \n3. If there are no weaknesses, everybody will be in bliss sooner or =\r\nlater and be established in Supreme Cosmic Being. Weaknesses ensure that th=\r\nere are people at different stages of spiritual evolution and the drama on =\r\nthis universal stage is interesting. The mix changes with time. In Kali yug=\r\na, there are more souls with little spiritual development and there are man=\r\ny more in Satya yuga.\n \n4. Animals have charts too. There are some rules to=\r\n see from the chart whether the being born at that time is a human being or=\r\n a specific animal. But that knowledge is corrupt today. A human being can =\r\nbe born as an animal in an immediate life and vice versa.\n \n5. Various deit=\r\nies are personifications of various great qualities within us. A normal min=\r\nd thinks of thousands of things and at any time has very little or no spiri=\r\ntual energy. When a mind focuses on one thing and forgets all other thought=\r\ns, mind is filled with that thing. If a saint focuses mind on a deity, deit=\r\ny fills one&#39;s mind. In other words, that mind vibrates with the spiritual e=\r\nnergy of that deity. Such a mind generates those vibrations in the subtle s=\r\npace and that can affect the subtle bodies of people around them. They help=\r\n other spiritual seekers. Secondly, if several saints are generating the vi=\r\nbrations of a specific deity in the world today, those vibrations get thing=\r\ns done in the world. It is almost like that deity is &quot;formed&quot; in the world =\r\nand does things.\n \n6. Ethereal beings are not like us. Moreover, they perso=\r\nnify various qualities within us, as microcosm (inner cosmos) is a mapping =\r\nof the macrocosm. Certain inner qualities are useful and we try to enhance =\r\nthem by resonance, by worshipping their personifications in the outer cosmo=\r\ns. Other qualities that come due to them (children of those deities) may no=\r\nt be interesting or useful to worship.\n \n7. Gods are not egoistic people li=\r\nke us and they do not get offended. If one is really committed to one deity=\r\n like you say and makes progress, one will eventually realize that other de=\r\nities are different manifestations of the same supreme being. The biases wi=\r\nll eventually go away when one has the highest realization.\n \nI will repeat=\r\n an old metaphor from vedic-wisdom yahoogroup. A mountain may have many pat=\r\nhs around it that reach the top. When you stand at the bottom of different =\r\npaths, the top may look different. One may start climbing the mountain alon=\r\ng one path and disregard other paths. As long as one does not get stuck wit=\r\nh criticizing other paths and actually climbs one path, one may eventually =\r\nreach the top. As one gets closer to the top, one will see that all paths a=\r\nre reaching there.\n \nSupreme cosmic being is like the top of a mountain. Sa=\r\ndhana with different deities is like different paths. The description of ho=\r\nw top looks like from the base (or middle) of different paths is like the d=\r\nescription of various deities in scriptures. If one keeps arguing that this=\r\n deity is superior or that deity, one is stuck. If one dedicates oneself to=\r\n a deity and strives to fill the mind with that deity through sadhana, one =\r\nwill reach that deity. Once one reaches the supreme cosmic being with that =\r\ndeity (if one does), one will realize that all gods are different manifesta=\r\ntions of the same supreme being.\n \n*        *        *\n \nYou are thinking w=\r\nell and that is a good sign. Think of subscribing to vedic-wisdom yahoogrou=\r\np (http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom). It has some nice discussion=\r\ns sometimes, which you may enjoy.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n---------------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Softwar=\r\ne, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals =\r\nfor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n    =\r\n Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writing=\r\ns: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n--------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------\n \nFacebook message:\n \nSubject: Qu=\r\nestions for the curiosity about the universal-drama and human\nRespected Gur=\r\nuji,\n \nSorry to take your valuable time. Could you please through light on =\r\nbelow questions and help me to judge the answers? I think, only pure soul c=\r\nan give reasonable answers. My intension is not to test your knowledge, I j=\r\nust asking to known that what do you think about them.\n \n1. Why there is no=\r\n reference about Dinosaurs in any religious book?\n2. If the lord Narayana h=\r\nas created this all universe then, why the other religions persons do not f=\r\nollow to Lord, even most of the Hindus also don=E2=80=99t have the knowledg=\r\ne about the Creator and Dharma etc?\n3. As we consider that Kaam, Krodha, Mo=\r\nha, Lobha and Matsar are the enemies, of human but if lord created this all=\r\n world then why Lord created this kind of bad things? Why today=E2=80=99s m=\r\nan is blindly running behind the money, fame and sex ?\n4. In one chart, we =\r\ncan see the past birth, but as per Puranas, it is not sure that our next bi=\r\nrth will be of human. Our Soul can come in animal or birds format too. Then=\r\n the question is, when we talk about the past birth why we always consider =\r\nthat in past birth, we were the human and we had this wish or we did this t=\r\nhis etc=E2=80=A6\n5. What is the use of a saint to world who is worshiping L=\r\nord in the mountain from the hundreds of years?\n6. As per Hindu mythology, =\r\nLord Shiva is the father of Lord Ganesha then what about the other generati=\r\nons of the lord, why do we not have the information about the current gener=\r\nation of lord=E2=80=99s family?\n7. A great Saadu who is blindly worshiping =\r\nto Lord Rama or Shiva or any religion&#39;s lord but who is not giving a 1% res=\r\npect to the lord of other religion, do you think this is kind of person is =\r\na real Saadu and really worshiping the supreme Lord ?\n \nThank you Sir to re=\r\nad this all, I am very simple person living in Nagpur and searching the tru=\r\nth of this all-universal drama, my most of the time has been gone in this r=\r\nesearch. I am not much educated but still having the curiosity about the de=\r\nath and birth. If you have time then you can see, whatever I talk about mys=\r\nelf is true or false from my chart. My birth details are &lt;deleted&gt;\n \nSir, I=\r\n hope you understand my questions. Please forgive me if I did any mistake.\n=\r\n \nThank you,\n&lt;deleted&gt;\n\n\n"}}
