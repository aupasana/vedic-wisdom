She was, at one time at l=\r\neast, the land of yogis, of sages, of philosophers and of saints. Today, sa=\r\ndly, after over 60 years of anti-Vedic, crypto-Marxist misrule, India is no=\r\nw infamous as one of the most corrupt nations in the world. Swami Ramdev ha=\r\ns revived an age-old tradition of wise and selfless yogis leading the way f=\r\nrom the evils of government corruption and despotism, to the re-establishme=\r\nnt of Dharmic governance, and the honesty, prosperity, freedom and justice =\r\nthat such Vedic governance ensures. Like Chanakya Pandita, Swami Vivekanand=\r\na and Srila Prabhupada before him, Swami Ramdev has shown us that, when our=\r\n politicians have abandoned the people and have all become scoundrels, we a=\r\nre to then look to the yogis for leadership. As the Middle-East has experie=\r\nnced its Democratic Spring with the fall of one long-standing dictator afte=\r\nr another, now the beginning stages have been dramatically set in place for=\r\n India, Bharat Mata, to have its own Freedom Spring, and to reverse over si=\r\nxty years of crypto-Marxist totalitarian corruption. When the politicians h=\r\nave become an enemy of the people, the saints will lead us toward the light=\r\n.\n\nThere are 20 million yogis in America, and tens of millions in Europe.  =\r\nYet, sadly, very few Western yogis are even aware of the fact that, until o=\r\nnly recently, Yoga faced the possibility of extinction in India herself - t=\r\nhe very birthplace of Yoga.  Almost no Western yogis are aware of the fact =\r\nthat since her independence in 1947, most Indian national governments have =\r\nbeen atheist regimes that were radically dedicated to the eradication of Hi=\r\nnduism, Vedic spirituality, and Yoga practice.  Up until just a decade ago,=\r\n more people were practicing Yoga in the American state of California than =\r\nin all of India combined!  Sri Swami Ramdev changed all that.  Almost singl=\r\ne-handedly, Swami Ramdev revived Yoga practice in the birthplace of Yoga, e=\r\nncouraging tens of millions to begin practicing Yoga for the very first tim=\r\ne.  Now he is leading a peaceful social reform movement to remove rampant c=\r\norruption from despotic government institutions and practices.  For his cou=\r\nrageous efforts, his life is in now danger.  Tens of thousands of peaceful =\r\nyogis and meditators have been violently attacked by government thugs, and =\r\nthis selfless servant of truth was temporarily arrested.  His crime was sit=\r\nting in meditation, fasting, and calling for ethical integrity in governmen=\r\nt.  With his unimaginable arrest and persecution at the hands of a viciousl=\r\ny despotic government, a spark of peaceful outrage has been ignited that ha=\r\ns not been seen in India since the days of Mahatma Gandhi.  Sri Swami Ramde=\r\nv has shown the world the quiet, dignified power of Yoga in action.  He has=\r\n shown us that Yoga is so much more that merely a series of physical asanas=\r\n, and that Yoga has the power to make our entire world better in every way.=\r\n \n\nWe Western yogis must extend our unwavering support to our brother and s=\r\nister yogis in India.  We must now translate the peace, joy and wisdom that=\r\n Yoga has gifted us with in practical terms in our desire for a better worl=\r\nd - a world of freedom, justice and peace for all living beings.  India wil=\r\nl be free.  India will re-embrace her divine heritage of Vedic civilization=\r\n.  The world will taste the bliss of liberation.  The Yogis shall lead the =\r\nway.  Welcome to the Dharma Revolution. A revolution of love.  Aum Shanti S=\r\nhanti Shanti. \n\n- Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya\n\n \n\nhttp://www.dharmacentra=\r\nl.com/\n\n\nPLEASE FORWARD!\n\n\n"}}
