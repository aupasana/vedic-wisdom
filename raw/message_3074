Spending half hour in front of fire is as good as \nspending 3-4 hours in meditation or other rituals.\n\nAlso, rituals work when done on a regular basis and with feeling.\n\nIf you do Ganapathi homam on a regular basis for 6 months, you should find \nthe right guidance regarding the next step. Leave it to Ganapathi. He is \nbetter than all astrologers.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nJyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, November 10, 2009 12:52 PM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Seeking advice on spiritual practise\n\n\n&gt; Dear PVR Narasimha Rao garu,\n&gt;\n&gt; I am absolutely new to this group.\n&gt;\n&gt; I had been going through your free lessons on astrology and refered \n&gt; several books on astrology as well, including the one authored by you. I \n&gt; was going through this yahoo groups and found one of the messages where \n&gt; you were advising someone to do &#39;chandihomam&#39; based on his birth chart. \n&gt; Likewise, I would like to get help on what kind of spiritual path is best \n&gt; for me and I can provide you my birth data if you are willing to help me. \n&gt; Currently I do certain things like Sandhyavandanam, Rudra-abhishekam every \n&gt; monday (lord shiva is my ishta devata), panchopachara puja everyday \n&gt; (almost). Sometimes I do Ganapathi Homam and Gayatri Homam as well. But I \n&gt; want to know if any of these or something different / additional is better \n&gt; for me. Is there a way?\n&gt;\n&gt; Regards,\n&gt;\n&gt; Nagraj Kota\n\n\n"}}
