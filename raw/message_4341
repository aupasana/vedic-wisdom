Unlike Raama, Krishna was an incarnation of Vishnu with perfect mastery over the entire field of duality. While all incarnations of gods and rishis are bound by duality in some way or the other, Krishna was an incarnation without any such limitations even in the field of duality. If Krishna really wanted peace, he could have definitely transformed people and created peace in the twinkling of an eye. But he came at a time when the call of the day was to reduce the weight on earth considerably and throw parts of earth back to dark ages so that civilization appropriate for Kali yuga could evolve in the next few millennia in many regions.\n \nSo, in order to keep the rhythm of Natural Order, he had to let the &quot;Big War&quot; happen.\n \n*        *        *\n \nBut why did Krishna even try for peace?\n \nFirst of all, he was setting several examples for us. Kali yuga is conducive to unnecessary conflicts and wars and ensuing strife. Krishna needed to set an example by emphasizing the value of compromise and peace, even though the purpose of his incarnation was to facilitate a big war, stop the march of adharma and reduce weight on earth.\n \nSecondly, there is a natural order. Every step of the Natural process has a purpose and things have to happen at the right time. Krishna going to Dhritarashtra&#39;s assembly and being attacked and insulted by Duryodhana and his cronies was the necessary last straw to ensure the fall of Duryodhana, Karna etc. Krishna having a private chat with Karna was necessary to create last minute confusion that would cloud Karna&#39;s mind. Like this, there may be several important and useful steps in even a process that seems to have failed!\n \nA realized person goes through the flow of Nature with neither excitement nor worry. Also, Nature allocates important tasks for such a person. A normal person goes through the flow of Nature with excitement sometimes and worry at others. Nature allocates less important tasks for such a person, for one&#39;s energy is dispersed and used only partially.\n \n*        *        *\n \nPeace, non-violence and forgiveness perhaps came to be over-stressed after the advent of Buddhism. One with the temperament of a kshatriya needs to uphold dharma strictly and kill if needed. Peace is a worthy goal, but dharma is a worthier goal. Action with detachment is the worthiest goal. By sincerely pursuing action with detachment and what one sees as dharma, over a period of time, one purifies oneself. As a result,  one&#39;s sense of dharma gets refined and one&#39;s detachment becomes better. \n \n*        *        *\n \n2. I doubt the authenticity of this story. Word given to a person should be kept, but one has to mind one&#39;s duty towards various people, including the citizens of one&#39;s kingdom.\n \n3. Whether Dasaratha followed his bigger dharma or a lesser dharma (that he had a bigger attachment to) is debatable. After all, doing justice to your worthy son and citizens of your kingdom is not less important than keeping the promise made to a wife.\n \nBut the bottomline is that when Mahamaya deludes great souls (born in that lineage and chosen as Rama&#39;s father, Dasaratha must have been a great soul!), it turns out in the end that even actions performed under the delusion serve a higher purpose!\n \n*        *        *\n \nBTW, always feel free to ask what arises in your mind. I will answer only if I have a thought to share and time to share it. But do not worry about propriety in asking ANY questions that are there in your mind.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Murahari Vadapalli &lt;murahariv@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Namaste Narasimha, \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. When the dharma of Rama and Krishna is to eliminate bad weeds and establish dharma, why did they send peace proposals to Ravana and Dritarashtra? \n&gt;  \n&gt; Why did Rama and Krishna try to bring about transformation in Ravana/Dritarashtra by peaceful means rather than waging a war? The reason for asking this questions is, India is culturally influenced by these deeds. We try to make peace even when the right solution is otherwise..example Prithviraj freeing Gori and then inturn getting killed by him and many more. \n&gt;  \n&gt; 2. After Vibishana is crowned King (before the death of Ravana) by Rama, Sugriva asks Rama, &quot;what if Ravana surrenders to you now&quot;? Since you have already given the Lanka kingdom to Vibishana, what would you do? To which Rama replies, he would crown Ravana the king of Ayodhya!\n&gt; Hypothetically, if this had happened, would this have been a right dharma on Rama&#39;s part? This is quite contradictory as honour and word more important here than dharma, negating dharma sansthapana verse.\n&gt;  \n&gt; 3. When kaikeyi requests Dasaratha to order Rama into exile, from Rama&#39;s perspective, it&#39;s correct because his dharma is to to go forest and bring peace and integrate but from Dasaratha&#39;s perspective, it&#39;s the word that he has given to wife that is given due importance than an eligible son ruling the kingdom of Ayodhya. Again here, the importance of sticking to one&#39;s word that is &quot;Said&quot; (giving a promise to Kaikeyi) is given priority over the importance of the word/thought that is &#39;&quot;unsaid&quot; (making Rama the king)\n&gt; In vedantic paradigm, even a thought that is in the mind is said to have caused a Karma to one (provided one associates sense of agency &quot;I&quot; to the action, which is here a thought). If so, eventhough he has kept up the promise (external), he has failed to keep up the promise that is unsaid. \n&gt; So, how is it that Dasaratha has honored on his word?\n&gt;  \n&gt; May be these questions show that I am not maintaining my discipline in my spiritual sadhana but since these questions are causing lot of confusion to me, I had to post it on this forum, which has been a source of inspiration to me. \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks & Regards,\n&gt; --Murahari\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 5/5/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt; \n&gt; People normally start doing rituals like homam/japam hoping for relief from specific personal problems.

There is so much chaos around the world especially India that we all need to focus on peace. I started homam for a better life for myself but soon realised that the problems going on around the world is nothing in front of mine. I started dedicating all my homams/prayers for peace around the world and request others who aren&#39;t doing so to do the same. The world needs us and the least we can do is pray. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Priya\n\n\n"}}
