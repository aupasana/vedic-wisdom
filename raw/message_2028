I have myself often wondered about the hierarchy of D=\r\nivine beings.. however I do believe that there is nothing &#39;higher&#39; than the=\r\n Supreme Brahman. \n\nWhen we delve into the metaphysical/abstract realms, th=\r\nings do get confusing. All the more so, because our intellectual/logical mi=\r\nnd is limited and cannot grasp these &#39;complexities&#39;. I have read that there=\r\n are several astral planes/dimensions/parallel worlds that exist alongside =\r\nour world, i.e planet Earth. Some of these astral planes are very close to =\r\nour dimension, so it&#39;s easier for the ascended Siddhas who dwell in these p=\r\nlanes, to have an impact onto our existence directly. For example, someone =\r\non the Moon would communicate more easily with us earthlings than say, some=\r\none from a farther planet like Saturn. However, the Supreme Brahman is beyo=\r\nnd all these planes of existence...\n\nMy two pence.\n:)\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasmi=\r\nhaji\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I have a question.

Also, he nee=\r\nd not be talking about somebody &quot;connected to&quot; his ashram. Moreover, when i=\r\nt comes to great lineages, there are connections between all. For example, =\r\nAurobindo used to visit the house of Sister Nivedita, the foremost disciple=\r\n of Swami Vivekananda and knew her well when he still lived in Calcutta. He=\r\n had a vision in his prison cell of Swami Vivekananda, just=C2=A0a few year=\r\ns after his death, in which he imparted Aurobindo some key knowledge.

And so on.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Coming back t=\r\no the main point, the supermind established in the field of earth that was =\r\nreferred to by Aurobindo can simply be a maharshi paying some attention to =\r\nmatters on earth.

I am posting it here for anyone interested.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Near the beginning=\r\n of the 20th century the great Indian freedom fighter and yogi-sage, Sri Au=\r\nrobindo, began to express a truth which had not been expressed before. In h=\r\nis high states of divine union he saw that the time had come for a new stag=\r\ne in the evolution of mankind. He saw that the divine was to manifest right=\r\n here on Earth and that the time for this divine emergence into Earth life =\r\nwas now. He spoke of heaven descending to Earth, even as Earth experienced =\r\na breakdown due to the intrinsic resistance held within her material body t=\r\nowards this =EF=BF=BDdescent.=EF=BF=BD\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Sri Aurobindo was join=\r\ned in Pondicherry, India, by a French mystic, Mirra Alfassa, who later beca=\r\nme known as the Mother. Together they embarked on a journey of intensive ce=\r\nllular transformation that is very relevant to the colossal uncertainties w=\r\ne face today.\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Sri Aurobindo saw that the divine force permeat=\r\nes all matter, and that all matter therefore has a force of consciousness. =\r\nThe process of the divine spirit descending down into matter is called invo=\r\nlution. The process by which the divine ascends back upwards out of matter =\r\nis called evolution. According to Sri Aurobindo, humanity has reached a sta=\r\nge where these two events are occurring simultaneously, and in his inner vi=\r\nsions, he foresaw that we would soon be experiencing a descent of what he c=\r\nalled =EF=BF=BDsupramental (or monadic) consciousness=EF=BF=BD that would e=\r\nntirely change everything on Earth.\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Man=EF=BF=BDs greatness i=\r\ns not in what he is, says Sri Aurobindo, but in what he makes possible. An =\r\nimmortal soul is somewhere within him, even if seldom active in most people=\r\n, while an eternal spirit overshadows him, even if obstructed from descent =\r\nby the hard lid of his constructed personality. There is a great divine pla=\r\nn in motion, even if the evidence of the outer senses seems to contradict i=\r\nt.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sri Aurobindo recognized that humankind is going through an evoluti=\r\nonary crisis. A stage has been reached in which the human mind has made tre=\r\nmendous strides on the one hand, but is left hopelessly inadequate to preve=\r\nnt its own extinction as a species. Meanwhile, as the Mother testified befo=\r\nre her death in 1973, a consciousness higher than the human rational mind, =\r\nwhat may be termed the Supermind, has recently been established in the fiel=\r\nds of the Earth, and is active there. Our task now is to bring it down into=\r\n cellular consciousness.\n&gt; \n&gt; Evolution took a great leap forward with the =\r\norigins of Life, and later with the emergence of Mind. We are now at the th=\r\nreshold of another leap forward, even more momentous, as we prepare for the=\r\n emergence of the Supermind. Sri Aurobindo speaks about four stages of huma=\r\nn evolution, which we will soon be starting to experience concurrently upon=\r\n Earth. The first is =EF=BF=BDanimal human,=EF=BF=BD our current species, a=\r\n rational being possessing an individualized soul, but largely obstructed f=\r\nrom contacting and merging with it.\n&gt; =EF=BF=BD\n&gt; Next is the =EF=BF=BDhuma=\r\nn human,=EF=BF=BD a species that is spontaneous- ly coming to birth under t=\r\nhe influence of an ever-expanding supramental field, a being that is largel=\r\ny able to merge and live from soul-consciousness rather than mind-conscious=\r\nness. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Thirdly is the =EF=BF=BDOverman,=EF=BF=BD who will still =\r\ninhabit a dense physical body, but will be in possession of the Mind of Lig=\r\nht, which is supramental consciousness that has begun to merge with cellula=\r\nr consciousness. \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Finally, our ultimate goal as a species is the=\r\n =EF=BF=BDSupramental Being,=EF=BF=BD divinity incarnated fully within the =\r\nsubtle realms of matter. This will be a race of what we could call =EF=BF=\r\n=BDDescended Masters.=EF=BF=BD In this species, the unity of matter and spi=\r\nrit would be fully realized upon Earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; The great work of Sri Aurobind=\r\no and the Mother was in bringing supramental consciousness down into the ce=\r\nllular consciousness of their own bodies. Since this is a unified conscious=\r\nness, this meant that the supramental consciousness was simultaneously bein=\r\ng brought into the consciousness fields of the Earth, awaiting the moment w=\r\nhen it would flower into its full manifestation in collective matter.\n&gt; Whe=\r\nnever there is a =EF=BF=BDdescent=EF=BF=BD there is corresponding resistanc=\r\ne. Sri Aurobindo and the Mother speak of their experience with the four =EF=\r\n=BF=BDAsuras,=EF=BF=BD essentially anti-divine forces, at work in the world=\r\n today. There is the Asura of Darkness, the Asura of Suffering, The Asura o=\r\nf Falsehood, and the Asura of Death. These are the forces that are so outwa=\r\nrdly apparent, and which seem to be in control of current global events. Ac=\r\ncording to them the Asura of Darkness (Lucifer?) has gone through a transfo=\r\nrmation recently, and the Asura of Suffering has returned to Source, and so=\r\n only the latter two still remain to wreak havoc on Earth. Interestingly, t=\r\nhey spoke of the Asura of Falsehood =EF=BF=BDchanneling=EF=BF=BD through Hi=\r\ntler during World War II, and of their own intensive inner work in counteri=\r\nng his influence. It would not be difficult to see how this same Asura may =\r\nbe influencing other world leaders in the current political sphere.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wi=\r\nth the descent of this new vibratory consciousness all our old obsolete hum=\r\nan structures will be demolished. However, Sri Aurobindo emphasized that al=\r\nthough the changes will be enormous they would not be necessarily catastrop=\r\nhic. The power of Truth automatically erases Falsehood, and our world for t=\r\nhe most part consists of Falsehood. Yet, the Supramental, he maintained, ca=\r\nrried a power of harmonization which could overcome this resistance by mean=\r\ns other than dramatic struggle and violence. The Asuras will eventually be =\r\nabsorbed into their original emanations of Light, Life, Beauty, and Truth. =\r\nIt may be interesting to speculate, with all the violence in the world toda=\r\ny, the destruction we might have experienced if not for this power of harmo=\r\nnization!\n&gt; \n&gt; When does all this happen? Sri Aurobindo and the Mother beli=\r\neved that the world stage was set for this quantum descent, and that it was=\r\n quite imminent. The Mother said in 1968 that the supramental transformatio=\r\nn was a certainty now, and that it would come about with a minimum of destr=\r\nuction, =EF=BF=BDalthough this minimum is still considerable.=EF=BF=BD She =\r\nsaid that the year 2000 would be a turning point.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; This was a ver=\r\ny interesting read and matches what Narasimhaji says about changes coming i=\r\nn the world.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; The upsurge=\r\n (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       Cricket on your mind?
