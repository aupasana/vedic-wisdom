But I pers=\r\nonally do not know good mantras of Veerabhadra.\n\nSati, a form of divine Mot=\r\nher, was the daughter of Daksha prajapati. She married Shiva against his wi=\r\nshes and he was not pleased. When he did a big yajna once, he did not invit=\r\ne Shiva. When he insulted Shiva at the yajna, Sati self-immolated making a =\r\nwish that She be born again to a worthy father. Shiva became mad and create=\r\nd Veerabhadra to fight Daksha&#39;s army. Sati was re-born to Himavaan as Paarv=\r\nati and married Shiva again. That is the story in a nutshell.\n\nEsoterically=\r\n speaking, Shiva represents the true Self. The word Sati comes from sat, i.=\r\ne. to be or to exist. Sati means the one who is or who exists. Sati represe=\r\nnts the self-awareness, which enables us to be and to exist. Prajapati is t=\r\nhe creator of all beings. Prajapati is associated with the brahma granthi i=\r\nn Mooladhaara chakra. Self-awareness is usually stationed in Moolaadhaara. =\r\nSati marrying Shiva represents self-awareness joining true Self, i.e. samad=\r\nhi.\n\nDaksha (means &quot;skillful one&quot;) Prajapati&#39;s yajna represents rituals and=\r\n sadhanas performed for acquiring skills and success in the material plane.=\r\n Obviously, Shiva (true Self) is not welcome here. When self-awareness with=\r\ndraws temporarily from the union with true Self and attends to the efforts =\r\nat the material level, it finds that these efforts are disinterested in tru=\r\ne Self. It is aghast.\n\nHimavaan (the icy mountain of Himalaya), on the othe=\r\nr hand, symbolizes grand firm detachment. Ice symbolizes detachment and the=\r\n mountain symbolizes firmness. When the Divine Mother immolated herself, sh=\r\ne was reborn as the daughter of Himavaan. This symbolizes self-awareness cu=\r\ntting off its relation to the material-mindedness and efforts to acquire sk=\r\nills and success and instead being rooted in very firm dispassion. In this =\r\nstate, self-awareness can be in union with true Self.\n\nVeerabhadra (heroic/=\r\nchief well-being) destroying Daksha Prajapati and his army symbolizes overc=\r\noming the material attachments and desire to acquire skills and success in =\r\nthe material plane. People think that &quot;well-being&quot; lies in having a healthy=\r\n body, good home, happy family, reasonable wealth, good job etc. But those =\r\nkinds of well-being are temporary and perish. The chief well-being lies in =\r\nnot having attachment to or dependence on any perishable thing and be able =\r\nto see pleasure and pain alike. Such heroic and ultimate spirit of well-bei=\r\nng is personified by Veerabhadra. When Veerabhadra shines in one, naturally=\r\n all desires to acquire skills and success vanish.\n\nAs I said before, all s=\r\ntories in our scriptures have deeper significance and they are NOT silly st=\r\nories made up by idle people.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n=C2=A0 Free Jyotish Softwar=\r\ne, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals =\r\nfor short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 http://www.=\r\nVedicAstrologer.org\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Films that make a difference: =\r\nhttp://SaraswatiFilms.org \n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Spirituality: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n=C2=A0 Jyotish writings: http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n---------------------------------------------=\r\n----------------------\n\n--- On Fri, 1/22/10, chaitanya.hazarey &lt;shreeramshi=\r\nshya@...&gt; wrote:\nFrom: chaitanya.hazarey &lt;shreeramshishya@...&gt;\n=\r\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Request for info on VeerBharda\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yah=\r\noogroups.com\nDate: Friday, January 22, 2010, 2:37 AM\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n=\r\n    \n      \n      \n      Hello All,\n\n\n\nThanks for starting and nurturing su=\r\nch a nice and informative group.\n\n\n\nI was reading in some literature - (Lat=\r\nest podcast on puja.net) about Veerbhadras. \n\n\n\nDo we have any more info on=\r\n Veerbhadra and its creation?
