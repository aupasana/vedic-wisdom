G=\r\niven you are very well read on both Dwaita and Adwaitya philosophy, what is=\r\n your take on the subject. \n\nCan a human soul reincarnate in a non-human bo=\r\ndy? And if so what is the rationale?\n\nPS: I am aware of the reasoning in mo=\r\nst vedic literature - e.g.\na) To reap the fruits of past karmas\nb) The last=\r\n thought carries the soul in the new body etc.\n\nThe question, however, is t=\r\nhat the Human mind & body is fully capable of experiencing all sufferings (=\r\nas I am sure most would agree). Besides, vedic literature also gives elabor=\r\nate description of the different types of HELLS - where a paap-Atma suffers=\r\n. What then necessitates a birth in a non-human form.\n\nIs it possible that =\r\nthe vedic references of non-human births were just meant to be deterrents f=\r\nor those who are intellectually less elevated?\n \nValue your opinion. Others=\r\n are welcome to share their views.\nThank you for your time & attention.\n\nRe=\r\ngards,\nMahesh\n\n\n"}}
