This i=\r\ns regarding Swami Brahmananda. I was \n&gt; reading a book on his life and vari=\r\nous incidents connected to him \n&gt; observed by other saints and his brother =\r\ndisciples.\n&gt; \n&gt; Swami Brahmananda or Rakhal Maharaj was the spiritual son o=\r\nf \nThakur. \n&gt; And no doubt a great spiritual super giant. Thakur used to sa=\r\ny he \n&gt; was one of Sri Krishna&#39;s eternal playmates who had reincarnated on =\r\n\n&gt; this plane.\n&gt; \n&gt; During his stay in various monastaries of the Ramakrish=\r\nna Mission, \n&gt; often other monks used to send new initiates to Rakhal Mahar=\r\naj for \n&gt; hios blessings. It was a generally accepted idea among the \ndisci=\r\nples \n&gt; of Thakur that any one who is blessed by Rakhal Maharaj will never =\r\n\n&gt; again be troubled by problems of lack of Brahmacharya. \n&gt; \n&gt; One day an =\r\nindividual came to Rakhal Maharaj asking for his \n&gt; blessings and said &quot;Mah=\r\naraj, please give me brahmacharya as a \n&gt; blessing&quot;. Hearing this suddenly =\r\nRakhal Maharaj said, &quot;Why do you \n&gt; people always come asking for Brahmacha=\r\nrya? Was does not any one \n&gt; come to me asking me to give him/her God? Isn&#39;=\r\nt God the final aim \nof \n&gt; everything.. &quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Is it possible for someone w=\r\nho cannot maintain brahmacharya to \nreach \n&gt; God?

In general, it is \n&gt; good to=\r\n try \n&gt; &gt; to overcome lust if it is possible.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Several &quot;normal coll=\r\nege going people&quot; were taken under his wings \n&gt; by \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramah=\r\namsa and transformed into spiritual giants. \n&gt; Swami \n&gt; &gt; Vivekananda, Swam=\r\ni Brahmananda, Swami Yogananda etc were college \n&gt; students \n&gt; &gt; when they =\r\nmet Ramakrishna.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; But it is not easy to overcome lust at all. Sever=\r\nal of \n&gt; Ramakrishna&#39; s \n&gt; &gt; disciples also struggled with it initially and=\r\n overcame lust \nwith \n&gt; his \n&gt; &gt; blessings. Lust is a very basic human inst=\r\ninct and not at all \neasy \n&gt; to kill \n&gt; &gt; completely.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the begin=\r\nning, it is ok if the thought does not go out of the \n&gt; mind. Set a \n&gt; &gt; ru=\r\nle for 20 days or 40 days or 108 days or some period like that \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nmaintain physical brahmacharya. Don&#39;t worry if thoughts come.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Feel=\r\ning of guilt is a weight and it does not help in overcoming \n&gt; the basic \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read =\r\nin AGHORA was the important thing is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove =\r\nthem from the root\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; True, suppressing desire will make the desire c=\r\nome back later. \n&gt; But, if one \n&gt; &gt; keeps fulfilling desires, they never en=\r\nd!! This is the nature \nof \n&gt; desire. \n&gt; &gt; Whether one desires money or kno=\r\nwledge (of anything other than \n&gt; Self) or \n&gt; &gt; physical pleasures, the des=\r\nire will never end no matter how much \n&gt; one gets.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Removing desire=\r\n from the root often requires suppressing the \n&gt; desire \n&gt; &gt; temporarily. B=\r\nut the thing to remember from the Aghora book is \n&gt; that just \n&gt; &gt; suppress=\r\ning desire is not sufficient. Practice suppressing \n&gt; desires, but do \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nremember that the final goal is to uproot it fully and keep \n&gt; working on i=\r\nt.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is i=\r\nf\n&gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can also do it , \nif\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; That is the right spi=\r\nrit!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Spiritual progress involves a lot of things and brahmacharya =\r\nis \n&gt; one thing. \n&gt; &gt; The most fundamental thing is to overcome ego and not=\r\n become \n&gt; attached to \n&gt; &gt; things. Developing detachment to one&#39;s actions =\r\nand possessions \nand \n&gt; &gt; developing a sense of surrender is the most funda=\r\nmental thing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; There are several things in spiritual progress. They=\r\n all come \n&gt; together! One \n&gt; &gt; person may develop detachment to actions an=\r\nd possessions and \n&gt; brahmacharya \n&gt; &gt; may become easy as a result. One per=\r\nson may achieve brahmacharya \n&gt; first and \n&gt; &gt; detachment may become easy a=\r\ns a result and come later. Various \n&gt; signs of \n&gt; &gt; spiritual progress come=\r\n almost together, but the exact order can \n&gt; change from \n&gt; &gt; person to per=\r\nson. Thus, do not be disappointed by your inability \n&gt; to get \n&gt; &gt; somethin=\r\ng.

Lord rama was also married and had kids..sti=\r\nll he was called Maryada purushottam. ..Lord Krishna has 8 patranis and 160=\r\n00 gopia.. well does it mean that Lord krishna had physical relationship wi=\r\nth all of them.. or he had not? that is all together different issue..But l=\r\nord krishna was shringar priya&nbsp; and&nbsp; it seems that he had enjoyed=\r\n physical realtionship. . (???)&nbsp; still he was called brahmachari. . ho=\r\nw? i am bit confused.. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I personally feel that to have sexual desire=\r\n and not fulfilling it,&nbsp; cannot be termed as brahmacharya. . it is lik=\r\ne cheating yourself... and\n if you are married and if you donot fulfill des=\r\nire of your spouse is also not good.. Please advise.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Thanks&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;R=\r\najesh&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Tue, 16/12/08, utpal pathak &lt;I&gt;&lt;vedic=\r\n_pathak@ yahoo.com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT:=\r\n rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: utpal pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@ yahoo.com&g=\r\nt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Regarding Brahamcharya&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Tuesday, 16 December, 2008, 2:12 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV id=3Dyiv30487598&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Let me put som=\r\ne thoughts and i&#39;ll continue writng as it keeps on &lt;BR&gt;occuring to me...&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;1) Thakur&#39;s marraige was never a marriage in physical sense&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2) =\r\nThe author of &#39;Autobiography of a Yogi&#39;, Paramhamsa Yogananda has &lt;BR&gt;menti=\r\noned in the same book that his parents lived like a Husband &amp; &lt;BR&gt;wife =\r\nonly once a year to biget child.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3) I&#39;ve read some where that our an=\r\ncient Rishis though married, &lt;BR&gt;lived extremely restarined married life an=\r\nd that too only to beget &lt;BR&gt;children.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;4) Adi Shankaracharya, Swami =\r\nVivekananda and all monastic disciples &lt;BR&gt;of Thakur, Swami Sivanada, Gnane=\r\nshwar, SainBaba, Aurobindo, Sri Sri &lt;BR&gt;Ravishankar and countless known rea=\r\nlised souls never married (We &lt;BR&gt;assume that they maintained perfect brahm=\r\nacharya) .&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;5) Many saints such as Tukaaram, Eknaath, Narasee Mehta, =\r\nJalaaram, &lt;BR&gt;Rishis of yore, Ekanaath, Mirabai, Jana Bai, and many other s=\r\naints &lt;BR&gt;were married. but i am\n confident that at some stage in their lif=\r\ne &lt;BR&gt;they would have ended, forever, the physical relationship with their =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;spouses.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;6)complete Brahmachaya includes Physical &amp; Mental. =\r\nphysical &lt;BR&gt;brahmacharya includes Restrain of all the indriyaas and not ju=\r\nst the &lt;BR&gt;procreative organs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There are many things looks contradic=\r\ntory in above but if one see &lt;BR&gt;deeper then there is a wonderful synergy. =\r\nthere is a common truth. &lt;BR&gt;what i&#39;ve started believing from the above wri=\r\ntten thoughts as well &lt;BR&gt;as many unwritten thoughts is that Brahmachrya is=\r\n one of the most &lt;BR&gt;important vertue for realisation. but it seems that ev=\r\nen married &lt;BR&gt;people will also start maintaining that, knowingly or unknow=\r\ningly &lt;BR&gt;before final realisation. actually, it seems that Like realisatio=\r\nn, &lt;BR&gt;Brahmachrya aslo DAWNS !!!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Warm Regards,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisd=\r\nom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; &lt;BR&gt;wrote:&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Members&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was re reading this thread o=\r\nn the light of something I had come &lt;BR&gt;&gt; across very recently. This is =\r\nregarding Swami Brahmananda. I was &lt;BR&gt;&gt; reading a book on his life and =\r\nvarious incidents connected to him &lt;BR&gt;&gt; observed by other saints and hi=\r\ns brother disciples.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Swami Brahmananda or Rakhal Maharaj w=\r\nas the spiritual son of &lt;BR&gt;Thakur. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; And no doubt a great spiritual=\r\n super giant. Thakur used to say he &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was one of Sri Krishna&#39;s etern=\r\nal playmates who had reincarnated on &lt;BR&gt;&gt; this plane.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nDuring his stay in various monastaries of the Ramakrishna Mission, &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n often other monks used to send new initiates to Rakhal Maharaj for &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; hios blessings. It was a generally accepted idea among the &lt;BR&gt;disciples =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n of Thakur that any one who is blessed by Rakhal Maharaj will neve=\r\nr &lt;BR&gt;&gt; again be troubled by problems of lack of Brahmacharya. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One day an individual came to Rakhal Maharaj asking for his &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; blessings and said &quot;Maharaj, please give me brahmacharya as a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; b=\r\nlessing&quot;. Hearing this suddenly Rakhal Maharaj said, &quot;Why do you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; p=\r\neople always come asking for Brahmacharya? Was does not any one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; co=\r\nme to me asking me to give him/her God?

Someone &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; else ma=\r\ny have to first overcome his lust even to have a vision &lt;BR&gt;of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the=\r\n deity. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; What is good for goose is not good for gander. In gen=\r\neral, it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; good to try &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to overcome lust if it is po=\r\nssible.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Several &quot;normal college going people&quot; we=\r\nre taken under his wings &lt;BR&gt;&gt; by &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa =\r\nand transformed into spiritual giants. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Swami &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Vivekan=\r\nanda, Swami Brahmananda, Swami Yogananda etc were college &lt;BR&gt;&gt; students=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; when they met Ramakrishna.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; But\n i=\r\nt is not easy to overcome lust at all. Several of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna&#39; s &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; disciples also struggled with it initially and overcame lust &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;with &lt;BR&gt;&gt; his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; blessings. Lust is a very basic human in=\r\nstinct and not at all &lt;BR&gt;easy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to kill &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; completely.&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; In the beginning, it is ok if the thought does no=\r\nt go out of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind. Set a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; rule for 20 days or 40 d=\r\nays or 108 days or some period like that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; maintai=\r\nn physical brahmacharya. Don&#39;t worry if thoughts come.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; Feeling of guilt is a weight and it does not help in overcoming &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; the basic &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; problem. Don&#39;t be over-burdened by it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read in AGHORA was the important =\r\nthing is not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; suppress desires but remove them from the ro=\r\not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; True, suppressing desire will make\n the desir=\r\ne come back later. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But, if one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; keeps fulfilling desi=\r\nres, they never end!! This is the nature &lt;BR&gt;of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; desire. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Whether one desires money or knowledge (of anything other than &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Self) or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; physical pleasures, the desire will never end no ma=\r\ntter how much &lt;BR&gt;&gt; one gets.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Removing desire=\r\n from the root often requires suppressing the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; desire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n temporarily. But the thing to remember from the Aghora book is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; th=\r\nat just &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; suppressing desire is not sufficient. Practice suppre=\r\nssing &lt;BR&gt;&gt; desires, but do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; remember that the final goal i=\r\ns to uproot it fully and keep &lt;BR&gt;&gt; working on it.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying for brahamcharya is if&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can also do =\r\nit , &lt;BR&gt;if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; not in 6 years at least in\n 10-12 years&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; That is the right spirit!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nSpiritual progress involves a lot of things and brahmacharya is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; on=\r\ne thing. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The most fundamental thing is to overcome ego and no=\r\nt become &lt;BR&gt;&gt; attached to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; things. Developing detachment t=\r\no one&#39;s actions and possessions &lt;BR&gt;and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; developing a sense of=\r\n surrender is the most fundamental thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; There =\r\nare several things in spiritual progress. They all come &lt;BR&gt;&gt; together! =\r\nOne &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; person may develop detachment to actions and possessions =\r\nand &lt;BR&gt;&gt; brahmacharya &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; may become easy as a result. One pe=\r\nrson may achieve brahmacharya &lt;BR&gt;&gt; first and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; detachment m=\r\nay become easy as a result and come later. Various &lt;BR&gt;&gt; signs of &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; spiritual progress come almost together, but the exact order can &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; change from &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; person to person.\n Thus, do not be disappo=\r\ninted by your inability &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to get &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; something. It may be =\r\npossible to work it out from another angle!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Best=\r\n regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- ------=\r\n--- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Your=\r\nself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Do Pitr=\r\ni Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;BR&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot;=\r\n target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic=\r\n-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/ved=\r\nic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://v=\r\nedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicast=\r\nro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software\n (Windows): &lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) w=\r\nebsite: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofo=\r\nllow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -=\r\n---- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste sir&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; i know you are lot busy but since i couldn;t ask this question &lt;BR&gt;on=\r\n a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; public forum as it may probably offend others.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n If you have time ,if you could please reply.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I =\r\nwas thinking this for many days&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; that as mentioned in recent th=\r\nread on brahamcharya,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it was important to maintain brahamchary=\r\na but i wanted to ask &lt;BR&gt;that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; even vimalananda had to work fo=\r\nr 6 years for overcoming lust &lt;BR&gt;though&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; he had his\n deity wit=\r\nh him from the very early in life.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; how can norma=\r\nl college going people like me who don&#39;t even have a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; deity obt=\r\nain this goal.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though i try to maintain physical brahamcharya =\r\nfor few months but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; after that i am not able to hold it ,&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; and even if i maintain some physical chastity it refuses to go &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nout&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; of mind&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Moreover, what i read i=\r\nn AGHORA was the important thing is not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; suppress desires but r=\r\nemove them from the root&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; So, how can i finish it=\r\n completely from my mind&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Though i have read Swami Sivananda&#39;s =\r\nbook on Practice of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Brahamcharya&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; but i don&#39;t think i =\r\nhave made any spiritual progress in maintaing&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Brahamcharya&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; and sometimes it makes me guilt ridden.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; The only reason for which i keep trying\n for brahamcharya i=\r\ns if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; vimalananda took such a long time probasbly i can also do=\r\n it , if&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; not in 6 years at least in 10-12 years&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; you can also reply on VEDIC WISDOM group but if you can remove=\r\n my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; identity from this that would be appreciable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; if what i worte offended you please delete this mail&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;deleted&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;HR SI=\r\nZE=3D1&gt;\nAdd more friends to your messenger and enjoy! &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://in.=\r\nrd.yahoo.com/tagline_messenger_6/*http://messenger.yahoo.com/invite/&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;Invite them now.&lt;/A&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n\n      Get the world&#39;s best email - &lt;a href=3Dhttp://nz.mail.y=\r\nahoo.com/&gt;Yahoo!Xtra Mail&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-1443491236-1229503839=:60781--\r\n\n"}}
