Aren&#39;t we worshipping that creator through his/her creation which could be a stone or something that we created out of our imagination (which again is his/her manifestation) like gramadevatas?  Based on your explanation, Gramadevatas could very well be the projections of someone&#39;s imaginations, which are equally true to the person who percieved them as Mahalakshmi or Durga to most of us.  Am I totally off on this?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Here are my 2 cents. I am cc&#39;ing the list keeping your anonymity. Great questions BTW!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (1) Durga literally means a fort. Goddess Durga creates a formidable fort around the individualized consciousness and that fort protects it from attacks by internal enemies and also from one&#39;s own conditioning. When a sadhaka is protected by Durga from all ten directions, one&#39;s conditioning cannot attack one from any of the ten directions.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Of course, we are not just talking about the physical directions here and talking about the directions taken in life, in terms of one&#39;s actions and work. Those who know Jyotish may recall that Maharshi Parasara mentions the rulers of ten directions as the rulers of ten parts in a chart known as &quot;dasaamsa chakra&quot;, which, according to Parasara, shows the work done by one. Indra, the ruler of east, shows administrative work. Agni, the ruler of southeast, shows transformative work. Yama, the ruler of south, shows disciplinary work. Nirriti, the ruler of southwest, shows pathbreaking work. And so on.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Each of Durga&#39;s hands represents one direction and shows killing pride and other such ignorant notions coming from work of a certain type. When Durga is protecting one&#39;s consciousness with all ten hands, one may do any kind of work and yet remain untouched by pride, anger, shame and such notions stemming from conditioning. In other words, one performs actions with detachment.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Now, you may note that the above form is the beeja (seed) for the madhyama charitra of Devi Saptashati! Eighteen handed Mahalakshmi is its devata and the actual killer of Mahishasura, as you correctly say, as per Chandipath. Mahisha literally means the mighty one. Mahishasura personifies our tendency to feel mighty or great. When mother Durga creates a durga (fort) around one&#39;s consciousness and protects from all directions, the seed is sowed for the killing of the tendency towards self-importance and pride.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; That results in the establishment of the eighteen-handed form of Mahalskshmi within one&#39;s consciousness. The eighteen hands represent eighteen virtues, which are the signs of a liberated being. They stem from the solar (push) and lunar (pull) principles applied to the nine qualities represented by nine grahas (consciousness grabbers). When eighteen-handed Mahalakshmi is established in one&#39;s consciousness, it means that one&#39;s consciousness is endowed with these eighteen virtues and one is unaffected by the tendency towards self-importance and pride. That means the formidable demon Mahisha is dead!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Whether the ten-handed Durga killed him or the eighteen-handed Mahalakshmi killed him is a theoretical question. Both are not that different. One does the groundwork and sows the seed and the other arises to finish off the job.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (2) Durga&#39;s vehicle lion represents the tenacity and dharmabaddhata (being bound by righteousness) of the sadhaka. The formation of protective fort around one&#39;s consciousness rides upon one&#39;s tenacity and commitment.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Lion is a better symbol of those qualities, but tiger is not bad either. If you need advice, I say stick to lion. But, even those who imagine her riding a tiger are not doing too bad. At the end, it is a symbol. If Durga were to really come and bless you, you would first show tenacity and commitment to dharma over a period of time and your consciousness will start to be guarded from the tendency to feel proud.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (3) I am not sure of this.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (4) There are millions of forms described in scriptures! The few famous ones are only samples. There are many many many many more.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; If I am sincerely desirous of experiencing the divine and imagine a form for that purpose, how likely is it that this is not any of the forms created and worshipped by rishis in the past? My friend, we are all characters from a nested dream sequence that finally traces back to the Creator. Our creativity finally traces back to the Creator. Even if I think I am imagining a new form that nobody ever imagined, I am most likely imagining something that was considered by the Creator or a rishi long back.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Of course, if you prefer, please stick to one of the forms described in one of the scriptures you have read. That is fine. But, if someone else is imagining a form that you are not aware of, you may not worry about that person! In the end, the person will experience something if one is ready and not experience anything if one is unready.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt;                     http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt;        Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt;        Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt;     Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; -----------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lately, a few queries have been bugging me. As usual, the only place I can run \n&gt; &gt; to with queries is you!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1) I have often wondered about the worship of Durga as prevalent in Bengal. The \n&gt; &gt; deity is called Mahisasuramardini. Ths is as per Chandi, same as asdasabhujya \n&gt; &gt; Mahalakshmi. But, the idols of durga are made wth 10 hands. Do you think this is \n&gt; &gt; a mistake?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2) A lot of people specially in Delhi worship a Goddess riding a tiger. I could \n&gt; &gt; not find anywhere any mention of such a deity. Durga rides a lion. This worship \n&gt; &gt; is done during Navratri. Agan, is this a mistake?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3) Similarly people worship Santoshi Ma, but who is this deity? I am totally \n&gt; &gt; confused. Similarly if one goes into villages one finds all kinds of deities - \n&gt; &gt; mostly female - wth all kinds of names. Like in Maharastra they have gaondevis - \n&gt; &gt; villages goddesses. Where did these deities arrive from? Scriptures have no \n&gt; &gt; mention of these..\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 4) Of course, even if one picks up a stone from the road and keeps worshipping \n&gt; &gt; it, over time it can acquire some shaktih and produce results. In that way, all \n&gt; &gt; idols and any conceptions are ok. But if that is case, what is the necessity of \n&gt; &gt; providing correct visualization in teh shastras? My lilttle understanding says, \n&gt; &gt; one cannot create deity, but worship a deity who has already been created by \n&gt; &gt; Rishis using the root energy of the Universe. A deity is like a archetype of \n&gt; &gt; some aspect of the root energy. And if the shastras are correct, then what is \n&gt; &gt; the use of worshipping to a form that is not that of an accepted deity? It \n&gt; &gt; should not produce any result logically...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Worshipping deities is wonder in my little experience but sometimes it can get \n&gt; &gt; logically confusing!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &lt;deleted&gt;\n\n\n"}}
