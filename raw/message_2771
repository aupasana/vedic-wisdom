My Saashtaanga Pranaams to the Great man called Swami Sivaan=\r\nanda.\n\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;chaudhuri.krishnendu&quot; &lt;=\r\nkrishnenduchdhr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; PRINCIPLES AND THEIR PERVERSIONS\n&gt; \n&gt; (H.H.=\r\n SRI SWAMI SIVANANDAJI MAHARAJ)\n&gt; \n&gt; The path of the spiritual aspirant ver=\r\nily lies through a bewildering jungle of difficulties and dilemmas of probl=\r\nems and paradoxes. One of such vexing paradoxes is that your mind is both y=\r\nour best friend as also your most bitter enemy. Mind becomes a true friend,=\r\n only after being gradually trained to be so. Mind begins to be really help=\r\nful after the aspirant has progressed sufficiently in spiritual Sadhana. Un=\r\ntil then it should be regarded as a troublesome and treacherous enemy insid=\r\ne us. It is extremely diplomatic, cunning and crooked. It is an arch-deceiv=\r\ner. One of the master-strokes of the mind&#39;s artfulness is to make the aspir=\r\nant feel and smugly imagine that he knows his mind perfectly well and canno=\r\nt be led away by it and at the same time to delude him totally. The mind ha=\r\ns the knack of making the unwary aspirant confidently think himself its mas=\r\nter, while it makes a hopeless fool of him. Its deceptions are subtle.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n You have heard the saying, &quot;The Devil can quote scriptures for its purpose=\r\n&quot;. Similarly the mind can use a virtue to indulge in a vice. It has an inbo=\r\nrn inclination to perversion. It can even take the support of a perfectly g=\r\nood principle to seemingly justify the most unprincipled sort of action. Un=\r\nless it is scrutinised dispassionately, its tricks are never fully discover=\r\ned.\n&gt; \n&gt; Certain of the perversions usually noticeable are described below.=\r\n This will be valuable to sincere aspirants who are eager to study their mi=\r\nnds and eliminate defects and shortcomings. These are extremely useful tips=\r\n specially in the working field, for aspirants engaged in active Seva in th=\r\ne midst of other people.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sadhaks are told, &quot;Keep up Matri-bhava or Dev=\r\ni-bhava when you move with women.&quot; This is a grand principle to safeguard y=\r\nour purity and spiritual progress. But this does not tell you, &quot;Move with w=\r\nomen.&quot; Nor does this advice mean that if you try to have this attitude then=\r\n you may go on freely mixing with the opposite sex without any limit or res=\r\ntraint. The mind will ask, &quot;Why not? What if I do? To retreat from their pr=\r\nesence is sheer timidity? No fear when you do so with Devi-bhava!&quot; Beware, =\r\nO Aspirant, beware of this tendency! Divine Bhava is not a license to throw=\r\n away all restrictions of the Sadhaka&#39;s path. The permanent injunction for =\r\nSadhakas is to totally eschew all contact with the opposite sex. When unavo=\r\nidably such contact becomes necessary, then, &quot;Have Matri-bhava; have Devi-b=\r\nhava&quot; etc., are prescribed. Also this is to caution the aspirant not to hat=\r\ne women or become a misogynist. Women should be reverenced but from a safe =\r\ndistance. Let not Devi-bhava etc., be taken to mean that you should be all =\r\nthe time in the midst of them. Watch your mind!\n&gt; \n&gt; Then there is the advi=\r\nce which says, &quot;You may hiss but not bite.&quot; This safe counsel was given to =\r\na fabulous snake which in a too extreme access of piety became so totally d=\r\nocile and harmless that it got severely mal-handled by a set of mischievous=\r\n urchins. It was given as an example to over-timid householders and people =\r\nstruggling in the very midst of the harsh realities of competitive `vyavaha=\r\nric&#39; life. Here an overdose of `Avanty-brahmin&#39;-like humility might well ma=\r\nke life impossible amidst the Asuric elements abounding in the world. There=\r\nfore, just an outward show of pugnacity may be countenanced in so far as th=\r\nis does not affect your basic goodness and brotherhood. But this policy is =\r\nnot for the spiritual aspirant in the path of Sadhana and Nivritti. Definit=\r\nely not. Let aspirants take heed of these words. The Sadhak is neither to &#39;=\r\nbite&#39; nor is he to `hiss&#39; even. This &#39;hissing&#39; business will soon become a =\r\npart of your nature. You will soon find yourself hissing for everything, at=\r\n everything, at everyone, in and out of season. This hiss will include ever=\r\ny variety of rudeness ranging from hot argument, sharp retort, curt reply t=\r\no angry glaring, shouting and abuse. In short of physical violence and figh=\r\nt, every type of verbal brutality will be put into the &quot;hissing&quot; category. =\r\nThis will ultimately lead to spiritual ruin. The mind is ever waiting to ta=\r\nke advantage of even the least concession shown to it. Its natural tendency=\r\n is to go downward. O Aspirant, do not bite or even &#39;hiss&#39;. Be humble, be s=\r\nweet, be gentle. Be firm but be soft, polite and courteous. If you wish to =\r\n&#39;hiss&#39; then &#39;hiss&#39; at your own mind. Thrash the ego. Fight the Shad-ripus. =\r\nWatch the mind!\n&gt; \n&gt; Another victim to perversion is the piece of advice, &quot;=\r\nBe resolute. Stick to your priniciples. Never budge an inch.&quot; The best poss=\r\nible advice to a sincere Sadhaka; but unfortunately often made the basis fo=\r\nr the worst possible trait i.e., obstinacy. This is a Tamasic trait. But th=\r\ne mind will make believe that you are manifesting Atma-bal or a divine dete=\r\nrmination. This is its work=97to make him cling tightly to his ego. Hence t=\r\nhis deception. But the careful aspirant must discern the difference between=\r\n Sattvic Nishta and sheer stubbornness. Atma-bal is not a cheap commodity t=\r\no be got without a great deal of earnest struggle, discipline and Will-cult=\r\nure. Determined adherence is advocated in respect of truly high and noble p=\r\nrinciples and not of self-conceited notions. By all means stick to spiritua=\r\nl Yogic Niyamas but avoid becoming obdurate in nature. Do not be deceived. =\r\nWatch your mind!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Speak the Truth always. Be frank.&quot; Thus is the Upade=\r\nsh. This means when you are required to talk then speak only the truth. It =\r\ndoes not at all mean that you must go about telling everyone to his face wh=\r\nat exactly you think of him or her. This is unwarranted behaviour. Under th=\r\ne garb of frankness to give free expression of opinions without caring for =\r\nother peoples&#39; feelings is not `Aarjava&#39; or frankness or straightforwardnes=\r\ns. At the least it is thoughtlessness; at its height it is sheer brutality.=\r\n It does not bespeak well of an aspirant. The same teacher who tells you &quot;S=\r\npeak truth; be frank!&quot; also tells you to have &quot;Mita Bhashan, Madhura Bhasha=\r\nn&quot; moderate and sweet speech. Mind can even make you to utilise frankness i=\r\nn order to express mild insult. An unpleasant truth is better left unsaid. =\r\nIf it becomes absolutely necessary and unavoidable then say it sweetly and =\r\nwith humility. &quot;Not to hurt and wound others&#39; feelings&quot; is as equally impor=\r\ntant as speaking truth. Satyam and Ahimsa must go together. Study thyself. =\r\nWatch the mind!\n&gt; \n&gt; Then there is the truism i.e., &quot;Vairagya is really a m=\r\nental state, mental detachment.&quot; The mind takes hold of this definition to =\r\njustify a heedless sensual life without self-restraint, or principle. The a=\r\nrgument will always be, &quot;O! I am not attached to all this. I can rise above=\r\n it in a moment. I enjoy it as a master. Mentally I am detached.&quot; Contact w=\r\nith Vishyas have toppled down even Tapasvins like Vishwamitra. Therefore, d=\r\no not take Vairagya lightly. Culitvate Vairagya diligently. Safeguard your =\r\nVairagya carefully. Be vigilant. Watch the mind!\n&gt; \n&gt; The caution not to go=\r\n to extremes in Tapasya also gets a like fate. Man&#39;s normal nature is sensu=\r\nous. The mind wants comforts and hates austerity. The indiscriminating aspi=\r\nrant conveniently ignores the qualifying adjective &quot;extremes&quot; in the advice=\r\n quoted above and views all `Tapasya&#39; with disfavour. The result is to dege=\r\nnerate into luxury, lose even the minimum of Titiksha and become a slave to=\r\n hundred wants. The warning is against foolish extremes but to a Sadhaka in=\r\n the early stages a certain degree of austerity is essential for developmen=\r\nt. The mind will suggest so many justifications. It will bring Gita to its =\r\nside and show that the Lord condemned Tapas. O aspirant, the Lord condemned=\r\n &#39;Tamasic Tapas.&#39; He recommended Sattvic austerity of body, speech and mind=\r\n. Reflect carefully. Always watch the mind!\n&gt; \n&gt; &quot;Take care of essentials. =\r\nDo not pay too much attention to non-essentials.&quot; The above too serves as a=\r\n handle for the mind to deceive the aspirant. If you have to follow this ad=\r\nvice, first try to understand what is essential and what is non-essential. =\r\nThe idle nature of man is to loath following any sort of `Niyama&#39; and set-l=\r\nines of Sadhachara. Therefore, everything is dismissed at a stroke as `non-=\r\nessential.&#39; Then what remains, God only can say. The only `essential&#39; would=\r\n seem to be to do what the mind likes. The Sadhak must think what a Spiritu=\r\nal instruction really means and then why it is given. Moreover, essentials =\r\nand non-essentials vary according to the stage of development of the spirit=\r\nual aspirant. What may be unnecessary to an aspirant at a later stage may w=\r\nell be essential to him now. Do not throw away precious grain with the chaf=\r\nf. Watch the mind!\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally the most dangerous deception played by the =\r\nmind is in connection with Sadhana itself. The very Sadhana that is adopted=\r\n by the aspirant to transfigure and divinise his life is converted into a p=\r\nrop and a field for the play of ego and senses. It is very difficult to bre=\r\nak out of this ensnaring net without great earnestness and sincere endeavou=\r\nr. It is this vitiation of Sadhana that keeps the Sadhak `stuck&#39;, as it wer=\r\ne, on the path, arresting progress for years together. For example, youthfu=\r\nl Sadhaks with sweet voice and musical talent naturally take to Kirtan and =\r\nBhajan as their Sadhana. Art always attracts admirers. He is in demand at a=\r\nll auspicious functions. He gets popular amongst Satsangis. The subtle mind=\r\n now spreads the net. The Kirtan becomes sweeter day by day. New songs and =\r\ntunes are added to his musical repertory. Without his being aware, the Kirt=\r\nan has become a means to attract others to himself and to maintain the popu=\r\nlarity. Thus the `Sadhana&#39; becomes double-purposed=97primarily for God&#39;s Da=\r\nrshana and side by side for worldly attraction. The result is the extraordi=\r\nnary phenomenon of the Sadhak caught in his Sadhana. Instead of Mochana, th=\r\ne quality of Sadhana becomes Bandhana. Maya is wonderful, indescribable. He=\r\nr ways are mysterious and inscrutable.\n&gt; \n&gt; Take Nishkama Karma Yoga. Servi=\r\nng and helping others for no return is something unheard of in the purely V=\r\nyavaharic world. Naturally the disinterested Sevak is regarded as an except=\r\nional being. All doors are open unto him. Many bring their troubles to him,=\r\n open their hearts and freely confide even intimate problems. They, of cour=\r\nse, take it for granted that the spiritual aspirant is perfectly pure in ev=\r\nery respect. Here the Sadhak walks upon the `razor-edge&#39; of life. The mind =\r\nis the devil. Through the very intimacy of contacts in the Seva field, plea=\r\nsure centres are created and sensuousness gets scope in this Seva &#39;Sadhana&#39;=\r\n. Vanity and carnality get catered to and the aspirant appears to take a ke=\r\nen interest in the Nishkama Seva. But a ruthless search of the mind will re=\r\nveal that the keenness and interest in the Karma Yoga Seva is as much for t=\r\nhe sense-indulgence to be had in the Seva as for the Seva itself. So the mi=\r\nnd destroys the Sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Aspirants practising Titiksha many a time sti=\r\nck on to the Titiksha for similar subconscious reasons. His endurance will =\r\nearn for him a reputation. He will be regarded as extraordinary. So even af=\r\nter the Titiksha Sahdana has served its purpose he will keep on with it for=\r\n continuing the status it has granted him. Another Sadhak will under the id=\r\nea of being indifferent towards the body and its needs, neglects to shave e=\r\nven. This will be quite sincere and bonafide in the beginning. But the long=\r\n hair and beard that results out of this &#39;udaseenata&#39; will prove the instru=\r\nment for Maya to lay hold of the aspirant. The hair will be found to beauti=\r\nfy his appearance. He is loath to part with it. Thus the former &quot;udaseenata=\r\n&quot; will be replaced by careful combing of the hair, application of oil, peep=\r\ns into the mirror, dressing to suit, the style of the hair, new mannerisms,=\r\n etc. Thus in a trice will delusion spring upon you and overpower you like =\r\nthe tiger does its prey. Likewise Hatha Yogic exercise get misused to susta=\r\nin gluttony; Vajroli is used for Vybhichara and Yoga is made to serve Bhoga=\r\n. All these perversions arise out of the mischief of the unregenerate mind.=\r\n Therefore watch the mind!\n&gt; \n&gt; The most extraordinary part of all this is =\r\nthat the mind will not allow you to take the above lessons seriously. It wi=\r\nll still say, &quot;O you are all right. This is not meant for you. Don&#39;t mind a=\r\nll this. Carry on as you are.&quot; O aspirant do not listen to it! Non-cooperat=\r\ne with the rogue. Take the lessons to heart.\n&gt; \n&gt; To know where exactly one=\r\n stands on the path is very difficult. The tricks of the mind are most subt=\r\nle. Only constant Vichar will keep you alert and safe. Deep introspection a=\r\nlone can reveal a little of the mysterious workings. Probe and probe into t=\r\nhe mind. Do not be lenient to the mind. The mind will try to compromise wit=\r\nh you. Relentlessly hunt out its hidden motives. Subject yourself to keen s=\r\nelf-analysis everyday without fail. Oust all sentiment in this process. Bec=\r\nome an intelligent, serious and earnest self-C.I.D. Carry on a ceaseless se=\r\narch and a vigorous enquiry inwardly. Put your mind on the dissecting table=\r\n of Vichar. Pray for the Grace of the Guru who alone can vanquish the mind =\r\nand enable you to master it. Pray to the Lord to illumine your intellect wi=\r\nth the light of knowledge. Watch the mind. Watch and pray. Thus alone, thro=\r\nugh introspection, analysis, discrimination, vigilance and prayer can you u=\r\nnderstand the subtle jugglery of this wonderful thing called &#39;mind&#39; and tra=\r\nnscend its deceptions and tricks.\n&gt; \n&gt; May the Lord enable you to realise t=\r\nhe importance of the discipline of the mind. May He crown your spiritual li=\r\nfe with success and highest attainment!\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
