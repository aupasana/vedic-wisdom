But what can be said aft=\r\ner \n&gt; some logical thinking is that if needs to &quot;test&quot; her bhakts on some m=\r\natter, then \n&gt; obviously she does not know her bhakt becuase otherwise ther=\r\ne would be no need \n&gt; for a test. And if she does not know her bhakt, how c=\r\nan she be the shakti to \n&gt; rule over all?\n&gt; \n&gt; The tests which people refer=\r\n to are usually the hardships that one has to face \n&gt; while undertaking a s=\r\nadhana. When one performs a sadhana, it is only to achieve \n&gt; some goal whe=\r\nther that be spiritual or material objective and the need for \n&gt; sadhana is=\r\n becuase the native feels that otherwise he/she may not be able \n&gt; to=C2=A0=\r\nachive the goal easily. So essentially the purpose of a sadhana is to remov=\r\ne \n&gt; the karmic burden towards achieving the goal. Law of karma does not le=\r\nt anyone \n&gt; of the hook though. The harships that you face while performing=\r\n a sadhana might \n&gt; appear like a &quot;test&quot; to a sadhaka but is essentially th=\r\ne Lord bringing necessary \n&gt; hardships your way which creates the suffering=\r\n in the sadhaka that lets the \n&gt; sadhaka shed some of the karma. The sadhak=\r\na will eventually be successful but \n&gt; the effort required and the hardship=\r\ns that are yet to be faced depends on the \n&gt; karmic burden.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the kar=\r\nmic burden is less, suffering is less and success is obtained without \n&gt; mu=\r\nch suffering (relatively speaking). If the karmic burden is very heavy, you=\r\n \n&gt; may suffer without seeing any success. Though you are now closer to you=\r\nr goal \n&gt; after the suffering, but since the goal is not achieved, you do n=\r\not see the \n&gt; results of your effort and feel the effort was a waste.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nMA does not tests...the hardships are brought to your way by her to purge y=\r\nou \n&gt; karmically to let you achieve what you want.\n&gt; \n&gt; This is my belief, =\r\nand this I use as a basis when performing a sadhana. I am \n&gt; sure others ma=\r\ny have other views though.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Bhupendra.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; _______=\r\n_________________________\n&gt; From: parijat_d &lt;parijat_d@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wis=\r\ndom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Sent: Wed, September 29, 2010 4:20:17 PM\n&gt; Subject: [=\r\nvedic-wisdom] A query\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0 \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; i am parijat dutta from kol=\r\nkata.there are some issues going on i need to \n&gt; discuss..\n&gt; \n&gt; since i was=\r\n 18-19,i became interested in tantras.and i worship ma kali.bt i feel \n&gt; i =\r\nhad and may be have to face several tests....like initially...i read books =\r\non \n&gt; tantra....wich promise highly materialistically beneficial sadhanas..=\r\n\n&gt; and alarmingly different dieties for each purpose...i fell for that...an=\r\n my \n&gt; devotion was divided...between maa kali,durga,laxmi,hanumanji..\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n with time i realized all these have no value without a gurus guidance.....=\r\nmy \n&gt; astrologer told me....that time will be arnd 29-30 of my age.\n&gt; \n&gt; th=\r\nen again...i was against krishna worship.....cuzz i thot fooshingly since h=\r\ne \n&gt; is only about love(bhakti)....he may not be strong like devis..\n&gt; agai=\r\nn since...all the tridevs need shakti...so i felt shakti worship is the \n&gt; =\r\nhighest....\n&gt; un\n&gt; also...at that time..i didnot like ramkrishna dev since =\r\nhe talked mostly of \n&gt; devotion...n not of powers like siddhis....\n&gt; undest=\r\nanding others thoughts n so on...as i have personally seen some tantrics \n&gt;=\r\n who have this power..\n&gt; \n&gt; with time again i learnt bhakti is the highest.=\r\n......i asked once a maharaj who \n&gt; presides over the ashram where my mothe=\r\nr was initiated ...\n&gt; which is more powerful ?? bhakti or mantras ??....\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; he said...in one word...bhakti is more powerful...without bhakti u wont =\r\nhave the \n&gt; urge to have a mantra...\n&gt; \n&gt; again in a book....i read...the l=\r\nove of gopis for krishna was such.....they \n&gt; forgot everything of mundane =\r\nworld..\n&gt; they didnot want to know who krishna was.....dint care if he was =\r\ngod or \n&gt; not......jst loving for the sake of loving..\n&gt; bhakti only for th=\r\ne sake of bhakti....\n&gt; \n&gt; how wonderful !!!....all these made me realize...=\r\n..how foolish i was.....all i \n&gt; used to have for maa was bhakti...i dint \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; know any mantra nothin (not now as well) and i was against on the othe=\r\nr hand \n&gt; .....of krishna and ramkrishnadev who were epitome of bhakti...\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; at this time....i used to go to my mom&#39;s gurumaatas ashram...once in a =\r\nspiritual \n&gt; discussion they said..\n&gt; get hold of only one ......he/she is =\r\nantaryami...she understands wat ur inner \n&gt; needs her...like a parent\n&gt; def=\r\ninitely she will fulfill them......\n&gt; \n&gt; at the same time....narasimha ji t=\r\nold in one of the mails........&quot;mother knows \n&gt; the best&quot;...\n&gt; \n&gt; these hav=\r\ne removed the misconceptions i had ...\n&gt; \n&gt; what i want to know is when one=\r\n is devoted to maa why does she test ??.....is it \n&gt; a way to bring one clo=\r\nser to her through realizations ??...\n&gt; \n&gt; when shes the all pervading shak=\r\nti....why thers a need for test \n&gt; ??....also...while testing does she give=\r\n her child enuff \n&gt; \n&gt; strength to pass the test ??\n&gt; \n&gt; i am looking forwa=\r\nrd to guidance from u people...\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
