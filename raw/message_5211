If you see an elephant carefully, your mind may be able to capture all of its details well. If you read thousands of books on an elephant without having ever seen one, you may still not be able imagine an elephant. Moreover, you may find different books to be contradictory. You may like some and dislike some based on your own biases about what an elephant looks like. If you see an elephant yourself oneday, you will realize then that books that seemed contradictory once are not that contradictory after all.\n \nSrila Prabhupada was undoubtedly a great saint. To go abroad without even knowing anyone there at an advanced age to spread Krishna bhakti, to roam New York streets without proper shoes or clothing in winter, requires tremendous surrender. Based on previous samskaras, some may not be attracted to his interpretations. But that does not take away anything from them.\n \nMy personal favorite is Lord Jnaneshwar&#39;s take on Bhagavad Gita and I also like Aadi Shankara&#39;s commentary overall. However, Srila Prabhupada&#39;s commentary is fine too and it is perfect for people with certain samskaras.\n \nSophisticated and complicated Upanishadic ideas are not palatable to everyone. They need to be simplified. Especially, people from monotheistic belief systems and subscription based religions need simpler models of divinity. So Upanishads and scriptures need to be interpreted so as to be palatable to them. So many great saints came and interpreted scriptures slightly differently, because there are different groups of people with different samkaras waiting to be guided by them.\n \nMy philosophy is simple. Read what appeals to you. Follow what you are able to. But, in the end, reading tomes about elephant are only the starting point. In addition, search actively and try to actually see the elephant oneday.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Rudra Aksha &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; I totally agree with Nithinji on this and once there was a very long discussion on Shri Shiva&#39;s status in their pantha in other forum(s).\n&gt; Better use a ref.from reliable source like Gita press for this.\n&gt; pranams to all.\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Sat, 11/13/10, K K &lt;kk889123@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: K K &lt;kk889123@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Astrologers and Priests\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Saturday, November 13, 2010, 7:03 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; Srila Prabupada&#39;s english translation of Bhagvad Gita at least and Iskon&#39;s interpretations are highly faulty and misleading.\n&gt; \n&gt; Nithin\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Fri, 12/11/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: On Astrologers and Priests\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Cc: &quot;Nagraj Kota&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt;\n&gt; Date: Friday, 12 November, 2010, 8:27 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; I was referring to Vyasa&#39;a Sanskrit version.\n&gt; \n&gt; One can access easy English translations by Srila Prabhupada of various scriptures (including Srimad Bhagavatam) at http://vedabase.net.\n&gt; \n&gt; In Potana&#39;s Telugu version, chapters may be arranged slightly differently.

The language is quite complex by today&#39;s standards (even in telugu), so I always have this doubt if I am reading it enough and interpreting right?

I will reply to them together.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regarding mail 1 below on priests:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Doing rituals for one&#39;s own upliftment is one thing and doing it for others is another. In the former, one is cleaning up a dirty place that one is forced to live in. In the latter, one is going to someone else&#39;s dirty place and cleaning it up. If there is some radioactive waste there and one is not protected, one may be affected.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As I keep saying, results of one&#39;s previous karmas are like fruits lying in a basket. One takes out one fruit after another and eats them. Some may be tasty and some may be bitter or rotten. When one does rituals and other spiritual sadhana, the deities throw away some bad fruits into a trash can and make one eat good fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be some spillage as dirty fruits are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be affected by the spillage.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In the old days, priests did intense sadhana and generated enough purity to handle such things. Many priests of today do not do enough penance. They are quite vulnerable as they start messing with other people&#39;s karmas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Secondly, many priests of today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to a brahmana father is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become a brahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of money or of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for others only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influence, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Well, stop doing rituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance when you are not doing rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regarding mail 2 below on astrologers:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This is not an immature comment and there is an element of truth in it. A lot of what I said above applies here too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Every action performed with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action of giving advice to someone resulted in that person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in coming years, there is clearly an action here. If the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to experience the fruits of it. Some blessings can come and some sufferings can come too.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Messing with someone else&#39;s karmas is always a risky business.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; What is the solution? Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmanas by conduct.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The above will become clear, if you look at the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught Jyotish!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\n&gt; &gt; Free &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mail 1:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any curse(Shapam)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; This I am asking after seeing the overall and general condition of Brahmanas specially those who do pujas for Yajmanas and involved in Karmakanda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; And if this is true is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I think this is the only place where we can discuss this subject hence I am posting this query here.Thanks a lot in advance.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Mail 2:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; I have just started listening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training sessions and am very eager to review my own chart. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; However in numerous instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and close uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse impact on yourself (astrologer) and yrou family.
