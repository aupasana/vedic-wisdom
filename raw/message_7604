The persons who have a lucky name number are luckier than those who are =\r\nborn on a lucky date. If the name is not appropriate, even those who are bo=\r\nrn on a lucky date may not enjoy the benefits of the lucky birth number. Nu=\r\nmbers and l...etters are considered to be the two eyes of human beings. The=\r\n way of nature is that if things are done in the right way at the right tim=\r\ne, success will be assured.\n\nLife has a number of problems to face. Such pr=\r\noblems can be resolved with the help of numerology. Numerology indicates th=\r\ne various ways in which problems of life can be resolved. It is a science o=\r\nf rare powers. Every letter has a sound and therefore a name emits sound vi=\r\nbrations. All the beneficiaries considered this science as an excellent too=\r\nl for awakening the masses and lead them to success with a slight alteratio=\r\nn in the spellings of their names.\n\nNumerology can be used to uplift people=\r\n from poverty to prosperity. Highly beneficial results can be achieved by a=\r\n slight correction of name. Several incurable diseases can be cured through=\r\n the science of numerology. Change of names produce definite and speedy rec=\r\novery from ailments. Life will become more successful when they change thei=\r\nr names to a lucky name. As we cannot change the date of birth , we add or =\r\nsubtract alphabets from the name to match the vibrations of birth date so t=\r\nhat all positive things should happen in life.\n.\nHow does numerology work? =\r\nBasically, it analyzes and uses the combinations of the letters in your nam=\r\ne and the date on which you were born to give clues as to your character, s=\r\ntrengths and weaknesses, natural talents, motivations and life purpose. Num=\r\norology help to get back on track and move in the direction you were born t=\r\no take. By making simple changes in your life that are more in line with yo=\r\nur numerology chart you may be pleasantly surpised at how everything seems =\r\nto improve, things fall naturally into place and you find the happiness you=\r\n have been seeking.\n\nBusiness names determine the success or failure of the=\r\n business, the best date to register the business and can guide when hiring=\r\n staff members in a business environment to ascertain what you can expect f=\r\nrom that person, how they will work together and the results they will give=\r\n you.\n\nThe main idea of numerology services is that it these services help =\r\nto influence people towards the positive and strong traits rather than nega=\r\ntive or weak traits. Numerology deals with the calculation of the future wi=\r\nth the help of numbers catering basically to all the individuals having a d=\r\nesire of reaching to the peak. It also deals with realistic use of the basi=\r\nc laws of arithmetic to the material survival of man. Fundamentally numerol=\r\nogy deals with the nine major planets and their planetary positions and cha=\r\nracteristic features. When number is in harmony with the number of any othe=\r\nr person, the client will experience a harmonious relationship with that pe=\r\nrson.\n\nWhen a person uses vehicles like car, or motorcycle with lucky numbe=\r\nrs and lucky colours, such numbers and colours prevent possible acciedents.=\r\n Numerology is used to determine a person&#39;s personality, strengths and tale=\r\nnts, obstacles to be overcome, inner needs, emotional reactions and ways of=\r\n dealing with others. If we use the art of numerology wisely and accordingl=\r\ny, we can channel the powerful vibrations that are universally emitted by t=\r\nhe creation of numbers and can be put into a form to which can understand. =\r\nThus the numbers will guide you successfully through life.\n\n-The top most p=\r\nolitical leaders, who could the destiny of their nations, take advice from =\r\nNumerologists enquire about their own destiny. It is matter of great intere=\r\nst that during the Second World War, Hitler used to consult his Numerologis=\r\nt on many occasions. However, when the Numerologist found that after gettin=\r\ng repeated success in battles, Hitler has started ignoring his hints, he st=\r\nopper serving him.. He then approached the British Prime Minister Mr. Winst=\r\non Churchill who consulted the Numerologist till the end of the war. It is =\r\nsaid that the great Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte used to spell his name as Na=\r\npoleone Buonapart. But on the advice of a Numerologist he omitted the lette=\r\nrs &#39;E&#39; and &#39;U&#39; from his name and heightened the power of his personality, a=\r\nnd became the Emperor.-\n\nThe name is not just a name but also a form of cos=\r\nmic energy. It reflects the goals, talents, lessons and debts, in essence, =\r\nthe reasons for being here. Logically. When you practise your name, your na=\r\nme vibrations are activated and reach out to the person/persons you are tal=\r\nking to. Having a correct personal and Business name based on numerology re=\r\nleases positive cosmic energy, thus providing you with growth and enhancing=\r\n success.\n\nNUMBER 13:\n\nThe number 13 brings the test, the suffering and the=\r\n death. This number brings the bad luck or the misfortune.\n13 may surface i=\r\nn the life to see problems in everything.\nFor an examples:\nIn many countrie=\r\ns, there is no gate 13 in any airport, instead there is a gate 12B. Many ho=\r\ntels do not have room number 13. Some airplanes skip a row 13, going straig=\r\nht from 12 to 14. Many tall buildings have resorted to skipping the &quot;thirte=\r\nenth floor&quot;, either by numbering it &quot;14&quot; or as &quot;12&quot;. Some streets do not co=\r\nntain a house number 13. In some forms of motor sport, for example Formula =\r\nOne, there is no number 13 car. Getting married on any day of the week that=\r\n falls under number 13 is highly discouraged. In the Egypt Tarot Cards ther=\r\ne is a picture number 13, which symbolises `Death&#39;.\n\n\nREGARDS,\n\nMR.VETHRI\nM=\r\nR.KHATIYRAVEN\n\nAUM BABAJI ENTERPRISE\n(PG0250357-M)\n\navailable for NUMEROLOG=\r\nY SERVICE, ASTROLOGY SERVICE, GEMSTONES, RASAMANI,AND YANTRAS.\n\n(UNIVERSAL =\r\nRESEARCH ACADEMY)\n\npersonal contact : 017-5340904\n\nEmail : babajidivineworl=\r\nd@...\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/babajidivineworld\n\n\n\n"}}
