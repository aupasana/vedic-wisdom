I never heard of that tem=\r\nple before\n&gt; and it seemed like a small temple. The name of the form of the=\r\n divine\n&gt; Mother present there was a Tamil language name and I did not unde=\r\nrstand it.\n&gt; I do not even remember the name now. But, when I closed my eye=\r\ns and started\n&gt; meditating with my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzl=\r\ned by a vision of\n&gt; a very fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like =\r\nSun. I felt that\n&gt; there was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do=\r\n not remember the\n&gt; name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple wi=\r\nthout roof over the\n&gt; goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a =\r\nfew times, but the roof\n&gt; came down in a fire accident each time and they f=\r\ninally decided that the\n&gt; goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spe=\r\nnt only 5 min and left in a\n&gt; hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. S=\r\nomeone from Tamil Nadu probably\n&gt; knows the name of the temple and goddess.=\r\n&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; The temple that you refer to is in Tiruchirappalli and is known as\n&gt;=\r\n Vek-Kali-Amman temple. By a coincidence, I was talking to my wife yesterda=\r\ny\n&gt; about this temple where the sanctum sanctorum is without a roof.\n&gt; \n&gt; b=\r\nest regards\n&gt; Hari\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Oct 8, 2009 at 8:11 AM, Narasimha P.V.R. Ra=\r\no &lt;pvr@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =EF=BB=BF Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If an incense s=\r\ntick with intense smell was burnt in a place, the air there\n&gt; &gt; will be fil=\r\nled with that smell long after the stick completely burns.\n&gt; &gt; However, eve=\r\nntually the smell will be gone! How long it takes to disappear\n&gt; &gt; depends =\r\non how strong the smell was when the stick was burnt.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Similarly, wh=\r\nen a great saint meditates in a place, the air there will be\n&gt; &gt; filled wit=\r\nh that saint&#39;s spiritual energy. Even after the saint leaves that\n&gt; &gt; place=\r\n or leaves earth altogether, that energy will linger there. Slowly it\n&gt; &gt; b=\r\necomes weak and disappears.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; In many famous temples these days, prie=\r\nsts have become commercial and do\n&gt; &gt; not have the devotion needed. The rit=\r\nuals performed every few years to\n&gt; &gt; re-energize the idols\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *      =\r\n  *        *\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; It is my humble opinion that some famous temples do no=\r\nt have much divine\n&gt; &gt; presence today, though I do not want to name any nam=\r\nes. At the same time,\n&gt; &gt; some not-so-well-known temples seem to have a pow=\r\nerful divine presence.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was very impressed with the Krishna temple=\r\n in Mayapur (ISKCON head office\n&gt; &gt; is there), Girnar hills in Gujarat and =\r\nArunachalam hills in Tiruvannamalai\n&gt; &gt; (Ramana Maharshi&#39;s place). There is=\r\n a tremendous amount of spiritual energy\n&gt; &gt; in those places. There are sev=\r\neral temples where the idol is practically\n&gt; &gt; alive. For example, even 123=\r\n years after Ramakrishna Paramahamsa left, the\n&gt; &gt; Kaali idol at Dakshinesh=\r\nwar is &quot;alive&quot;. I did not get the same impression at\n&gt; &gt; the famous Kaligha=\r\nt temple which is also in Calcutta.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There was one small temple in T=\r\namil Nadu that I was taken to by a priest\n&gt; &gt; who took me to visit about 30=\r\n temples all over Tamil Nadu before we did the\n&gt; &gt; Shata Chandi homam in Ch=\r\nennai in 2006. I never heard of that temple before\n&gt; &gt; and it seemed like a=\r\n small temple. The name of the form of the divine\n&gt; &gt; Mother present there =\r\nwas a Tamil language name and I did not understand it.\n&gt; &gt; I do not even re=\r\nmember the name now. But, when I closed my eyes and started\n&gt; &gt; meditating =\r\nwith my mantra in front of the idol, I was dazzled by a vision of\n&gt; &gt; a ver=\r\ny fierce goddess whose face was emiting rays like Sun. I felt that\n&gt; &gt; ther=\r\ne was a powerful presence there. Unfortunately, I do not remember the\n&gt; &gt; n=\r\name of the place or the goddess, but it is a temple without roof over the\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; goddess. They tried to put a roof over the goddess a few times, but the =\r\nroof\n&gt; &gt; came down in a fire accident each time and they finally decided th=\r\nat the\n&gt; &gt; goddess likes open air and no roof. Though we spent only 5 min a=\r\nnd left in a\n&gt; &gt; hurry, I was very pleased with that temple. Someone from T=\r\namil Nadu probably\n&gt; &gt; knows the name of the temple and goddess.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Li=\r\nke this, I am sure there are many temples with a powerful divine presence\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; across India.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Apart from the Kaali temple at Dakshineshwar, one =\r\nof my best experiences\n&gt; &gt; when meditating was at the Krishna/Vitthal templ=\r\ne at Aalandi near Pune. I am\n&gt; &gt; sure that Jnaneshwar Maharaj is still medi=\r\ntating in the underground chamber\n&gt; &gt; there.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Even the middle of a busy road in India is better for meditating than=\r\n a\n&gt; &gt; temple in USA. These western countries are so filled with rajas and =\r\ntamas.\n&gt; &gt; There is rajas in India too, but there is a good amount of sattw=\r\na there.\n&gt; &gt; Thus, any temple in India will be a good place to meditate, bu=\r\nt my view is\n&gt; &gt; that there is not much left at *some* temples. But some te=\r\nmples are really\n&gt; &gt; good.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; If one has a chance to spend a few month=\r\ns doing spiritual sadhana near a\n&gt; &gt; temple, I suggest the following:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; Mayapur, Dakshineshwar, Puri and Kamakhya in east India, Kurtaalam,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nTiruvannamalai (Arunachalam hills) and Narayana vanam (near Tirupati) in\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; south India, Shirdi, Aalandi, Dwaraka and Girnar mountains (Junagadh) in\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; west India, Varanasi, Vrindavan and Hrishikesh in north India and Srisa=\r\nilam\n&gt; &gt; and Mantralayam and Ujjain in central India.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; There are man=\r\ny other good places, but the above come to my mind. Visiting a\n&gt; &gt; temple o=\r\nnce is one thing and staying there for several months while\n&gt; &gt; maintaining=\r\n a simple lifestyle and doing a spiritual sadhana (like homam or\n&gt; &gt; japam)=\r\n there is quite another.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; .\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
