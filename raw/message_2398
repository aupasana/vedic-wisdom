It is not rel=\r\nigion. It is no better than atheism -\na little less. ... You Christians, ha=\r\nve you found nothing else in the Bible\nthan working for fellow creatures, b=\r\nuilding . . . hospitals ? . . . Here\nstands a shopkeeper and says how Jesus=\r\n would have kept the shop! Jesus would\nneither have kept a saloon, nor a sh=\r\nop, nor have edited a newspaper.\n\nWhat is the goal of it all? Can senses ev=\r\ner be the goal? Can enjoyment of\npleasure ever be the goal? Can this life e=\r\nver be the goal of the soul? If it\nis, better die this moment; do not want =\r\nthis life! If that is the fate of\nman, that he is going to be only the perf=\r\nected machine, it would just mean\nthat we go back to being trees and stones=\r\n and things like that. Did you ever\nhear a cow tell a lie or see a tree ste=\r\nal? They are perfect machines. They\ndo not make mistakes. They live in a wo=\r\nrld where everything is finished. ...\n\nWhere God is, there is no other. Whe=\r\nre the world is, there is no God. These\ntwo will never unite. [Like] light =\r\nand darkness. That is what I have\nunderstood from Christianity and the life=\r\n of the Teacher. Is not that\nBuddhism? Is not that Hinduism? Is not that Mo=\r\nhammedanism? Is not that the\nteaching of all the great sages and teachers? =\r\nWhat is the world that is to\nbe given up? It is here.\n\nGreat men have died.=\r\n Weak men have died. Gods have died. Death =97 death\neverywhere. This world=\r\n is a graveyard of the infinite past, yet we cling to\nthis [body]: &quot;I am ne=\r\nver going to die&quot;. Knowing for sure [that the body must\ndie] and yet clingi=\r\nng to it. There is meaning in that too [because in a\nsense we do not die]. =\r\nThe mistake is that we cling to the body when it is\nthe spirit that is real=\r\nly immortal.\n\nPractical religion is identifying myself with my Self. Stop t=\r\nhis wrong\nidentification! How far are you advanced in that? You may have bu=\r\nilt two\nthousand hospitals, built fifty thousand roads, and yet what of tha=\r\nt, if\nyou, have not realised that you are the spirit? You die a dog&#39;s; deat=\r\nh, with\nthe same feelings that the dog does. The dog howls and weeps becaus=\r\ne he\nknows that he is only matter and he is going to be dissolved.\n\nThere i=\r\ns death, you know, inevitable death, in water, in air, in the palace,\nin th=\r\ne prison - death everywhere.

Good works, when you=\r\n do\nthem with a pure mind.\n\nThe Kingdom of Heaven is within us. He is there=\r\n. He is the soul of all\nsouls. See Him in your own soul. That is practical =\r\nreligion. That is\nfreedom.
