In general any pre-cautions are to be taken if we have to read/do j=\r\napa with veda mantra during the night time.\n\nCan i read veda mantras while =\r\nsleeping on bed? (not in a casual way by any means)\n\nI some times put on th=\r\ne some vedic chants during night and while listening to them sleep, the cha=\r\nnts go on till the morning until i wakes up again. Is this is an acceptable=\r\n way? \n\nKindly give me your thoughts on this.\n\nThanks\nKK\n\n\n"}}
