Previous karmas placed him in a position to enjoy t=\r\nhat power. To predict the specific degree of power and make an accurate pre=\r\ndiction, is the horoscope sufficient always? Could the exercise of free wil=\r\nl in this life until now make a difference in some high profile charts?&quot;\n\n.=\r\n................................................\n\n \nThere is one thing that=\r\n we - todays astrologers - miss badly, and that is some genuine intution. W=\r\nhatever astrology we practise is only and purely a logical exercise. \n \nI h=\r\nad the good luck of coming across a man who was possibly the most spiritual=\r\nly advanced person I have come across till date, who could tell things with=\r\n such pin point accuracy that it would put any astrologer to shame. \n \nSo i=\r\nntution is a far better way of predicting the future, if one can acquire th=\r\nat. And since our astrology mostly rests on logical with little or no intut=\r\nion, it could be the reason why we make mistakes.\n \nSecondly, to assume tha=\r\nt political people have a higher degree of freewill (less binding prarabdha=\r\n karma) does not make sense. I  believe freewill and destiny have a strange=\r\n relationship. The more freewill I use today, will increse my destiny at a =\r\nlater date such that I won&#39;t have much maneuverability left. So that means =\r\na political person must have used less amount of freewill inhis previous bi=\r\nrth to be able to use more of it now. But that seems improbable. A person w=\r\nho uses less freewill is a very spiritual person, he leaves things to God o=\r\nr takes things as it comes.. Politicians are not exactly that way.\n \nAnothe=\r\nr thing with Indian polticians is that, many of them do actually indulge in=\r\n employing people to do heavy duty tantrik pujas etc to help them out. For =\r\nexample, when teh UPA Govt was facing the no confidence motion last year, a=\r\n very famous Indian politician sent a team of tantriks to perform some puja=\r\ns at the Ugra Tara temple in Kamakhya. The homas lasted for 21 days with in=\r\nnumerable animal sacrifices. I know of quite a few other cases too. Of cour=\r\nse the UPA Govt came out of the problem.\n \nAll these do play a part without=\r\n doubt.  \n \nAn average astrologer sees at least 10 times more nymber of ord=\r\ninary charts than political charts. Even in ordinary charts, mistakes WILL =\r\nand do happen. But since the volume of charts is more, we tend to see more =\r\nsuccesses. In the case of Political charts, the volume is less,  therefore =\r\nmistakes seem more pronounced. If we do a statistical analysis, we may see =\r\nsimilar ratio of mistakes in both cases (ordinary vs political charts).\n \nT=\r\nherefore, the issue is with astrology itself. The factors maybe way too man=\r\ny to be judged correctly only by rules. Some genuine intution is must.\n \nJu=\r\nst my views.\n \n-Regards\n Rajarshi\n\n\n"}}
