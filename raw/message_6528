He positively asserts that, on the dawn of knowledge=\r\n, karma naturally and necessarily ceases to function. Karma of any kind is,=\r\n according to Shankara, a hindrance to final emancipation of the soul, and =\r\nthe performance of karma involves one in the cycle of samsara. It is only B=\r\nrahmajnana that rends asunder the knots of ignorance and bestows moksha on =\r\nthe soul.\n\nSannyasa is absolutely necessary whether it be vividisha-sannyas=\r\na or vidvat-sannyasa. Without perfect renunciation it is impossible to purs=\r\nue the path of Brahmavidya.\n\n\n"}}
