But I feel that these two are different and co-ex=\r\nisting properties of God.\n\nWhen we talk about a coin. we say that this is a=\r\n coin of such and such denomination. It has a head and tail. when we go dee=\r\nper we get to know that coin is all made of nickel. it is insignificant to =\r\nknow whether it has head or tail. important is that it is all nickel. When =\r\nwe go further deep we realise that there is nothing but protons and electro=\r\nns and neutrons. And these are the same protons/electrons and neutrons whic=\r\nh make whole universe.\n\nWhen we think as head and tail, at this stage we ar=\r\ne just introduced to a deity. We see His form keep faith on His form. When =\r\nwe go deeper we realise that This deity fills whole universe and this whole=\r\n universe is accomodated by the deity. This stage resembles to the stage wh=\r\nere we see coin as a piece of nickel. When we further go deeper, we realise=\r\n that the deity is nothing but manifestation of that nirvikar brahma. And t=\r\nhis Nirvikar brahma is the one who fills all the universe and all the deiti=\r\nes are manifestation of that Nirvikar brahma alone. At this stage one under=\r\nstand that there is no difference between these deities.\n\nYou can think of =\r\ndifferent deities as coins of different currencies/countries. Coin of any c=\r\nountry can be used to buy clothes/food etc and all of them are as valuable.=\r\n all of them are made of different alloys/metals. But all of them are made =\r\nof same protons/electrons and neutrons.\n\nThese three different properties a=\r\nre not same contradicting properties. But they are all three different prop=\r\nerties. Same coin have head and tail. Same coin is made of nickel and same =\r\ncoin is made of neutrons etc. So these are not confusing but well explainin=\r\ng I think.\n\nSorry if I confused you further. I usually do so. In short I ca=\r\nn say that Duality and Non-duality these should not be confused as contradi=\r\nctory. but they are two different properties of same god.\n\nSorry for the mi=\r\nstakes\n\nDeep regards\nwith the grace of Lord krishna\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste T,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; It is confusing !\n&gt; &gt;Which is why, I understand only duality to follow =\r\n:-)\n&gt; \n&gt; You removed your confusion by writing last statement :-).\n&gt; It is =\r\nall duality and only duality till there is an experience of oneness...even =\r\nif a small tiny one.

Are th=\r\ney one with him or separate ? If the former, how are they separate now? If =\r\nthe latter, then they are still in duality !\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Which is why, I under=\r\nstand only duality to follow :-)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; T\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
