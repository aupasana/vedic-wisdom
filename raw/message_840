However, there are a few other factors to consider:\n \n(1) Man=\r\ntras in Sanskrit have been meditated upon by many saints and yogis in the p=\r\nast and their effect on the mind is well-understood. A sequence of sounds, =\r\nwhen repeated with full mental focus, creates a certain energy. Just thinki=\r\nng of the meaning may not create the same energy. For example, sounds witho=\r\nut any meaning also produce specific energies in the mind when we focus on =\r\nthose sounds single-mindedly.\n \n(2) The sadhana of so many saints and yogis=\r\n who used the mantras before adds to the power of those Sanskrit mantras.\n =\r\n\nThis is my opinion: Reading meanings of Chandipath is also good and create=\r\ns positive thoughts. But repeating the Sanskrit mantras (even without under=\r\nstanding the meaning) is superior to that! It creates well-understood energ=\r\ny in the consciousness.\n \nIf one carrying a seed does not understand what i=\r\nt is for and makes a replica in gold, which in his opinion is better, one i=\r\ns losing the basic functionality of the seed. The golden seed may appeal to=\r\n one as it does not get spoiled and looks better to one&#39;s senses, but it ca=\r\nn never give rise to a plant. The original seed, on the other hand, can giv=\r\ne rise to a plant when one figures out how to germinate it.\n \n*        *   =\r\n     *\n \nOne or two years back, I wanted to translate Chandipath into Hindi=\r\n or Telugu (my mother tongue) in poetic form or even prose form so that peo=\r\nple speaking those languages can read it instead of Sanskrit verses and und=\r\nerstand better what they are reading. But my guru (Manish) discouraged me. =\r\nHe said something written by a person like me with a dense ego would not ha=\r\nve the same power as a Puranic verse. The Sanskrit verses of Chandipath wer=\r\ne composed by someone with a highly effaced ego and in communion with divin=\r\nity. The same could be said about several sacred writings in many religions=\r\n in many languages. There is something special about words composed by sain=\r\nts, yogis and messiahs who were in a very elevated state of being, where th=\r\ne individual ego is effaced largely and the mind is filled with some divine=\r\n energy (which is not possible when individual ego occupies the space of mi=\r\nnd).\n \nSo Manish told me to wait till I was ready (if ever) for such a proj=\r\nect. I realized the wisdom in his advice and removed the thought of this pr=\r\noject from my mind.\n \nWhen Jnaneshwar Maharaj composed Jnaneshwari (Marathi=\r\n translation of Bhagavad Gita in poetic form), he was in a very purified st=\r\nate of consciousness. Hence there is divine power in his Marathi words and =\r\nmany saints experienced divinity by chanting his Marathi verses. Same with =\r\nRam Charit Manas by Sant Tulasidas. Those are inspired translations.\n \nIf o=\r\nne has access only to words spoken by a normal person in a language that on=\r\ne can understand, it is better to repeat words spoken by an elevated being =\r\ninstead, even if one does not understand the meaning.\n \nBest regards,\nNaras=\r\nimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo =\r\na Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpa=\r\nnas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://g=\r\nroups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedic=\r\nastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst=\r\nrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org=\r\n\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n  ---=\r\n-- Original Message ----- \n  Dear Sir Narsimhaji,\n  There are two thinking =\r\nfor Chandipath chanting.\n\n  1. Every verse in Chandipath is a mantra and re=\r\nading of Chandipath in Sanskrit is more meaningful to please Goddess and to=\r\n get desired results. It is created in Sanskrit and whether we may follow t=\r\nhe meaning of the verses or not, we should read in Sanskrit only if we can =\r\nread Sanskrit fluently because every Verse has its vibrations with full of =\r\nenergy.\n\n  2. If we read in Sanskrit, we never involve ourselves in the &#39;Li=\r\nla&#39; of Durga nor we enjoy the story of Janma(Birth) of different Shakties n=\r\narrated in Chandipath  (This is only possible for those who are scholars in=\r\n Sanskrit and can translate each and every verse immediately while reading.=\r\n For others it is simply reading with faith and devotion.)- Better way is, =\r\nit should be read in regional language with full involvement in the &#39;Lila&#39;.=\r\n Here we can enjoy the different roles of Shaktis, fully understand the dif=\r\nfernet Births etc. This type of reading makes Chandipath more meaningful. \n=\r\n\n  Dear Sir, I request your advice as what is the real way of chanting Sri =\r\nChandipath from these two?\n\n  Dr. Ashwin Rawal\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_0335_01C96B67.AE563AA0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;STYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;#ygrp-mkp {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PAD=\r\nDING-RIGHT: 14px; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-LEFT: 14px; PADDIN=\r\nG-BOTTOM: 0px; MARGIN: 14px 0px; BORDER-LEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; PADDING-TO=\r\nP: 0px; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid; FONT-FAMILY: Arial\n}\n#ygrp-mkp HR=\r\n {\n\tBORDER-RIGHT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-TOP: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-=\r\nLEFT: #d8d8d8 1px solid; BORDER-BOTTOM: #d8d8d8 1px solid\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {=\r\n\n\tFONT-WEIGHT: bold; FONT-SIZE: 85%; MARGIN: 10px 0px; COLOR: #628c2a; LINE=\r\n-HEIGHT: 122%\n}\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\n\tMARGIN-BOTTOM: 10px\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad {\n\tPA=\r\nDDING-RIGHT: 0px; PADDING-LEFT: 0px; PADDING-BOTTOM: 0px; PADDING-TOP: 0px\n=\r\n}\n#ygrp-mkp .ad A {\n\tCOLOR: #0000ff; TEXT-DECORATION: none\n}\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n\n&lt;MET=\r\nA content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3492&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=\r\n=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FO=\r\nNT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;Thinking of the stories of the Mother and \ncontemplating on them can h=\r\nelp one.
