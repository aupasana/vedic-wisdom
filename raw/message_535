Whether you are walking or talking or \ndriving or typing or reading or writing or answering nature&#39;s calls, you can \nstill silently chant His name in the mind.\n\nIf you do this enough, your mind will start chanting his name when it is \nasleep too!\n\nYour goal should be to repeat a (any) name of the Lord all the time, so that \ntaking that name becomes the second nature to your mind!\n\nOther things are not as useful as getting addicted to a name of the Lord.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Bivash Ramroop&quot; &lt;bivaash108@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Friday, October 10, 2008 2:38 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Harish Johari&#39;s books\n\n\n&gt; Om Brihaspataye Namah\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste dear Narasimhaji and other enlightened members,\n&gt;\n&gt; I have come across some interesting information about Harish Johari,\n&gt; being an enlightened soul.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have been reading his &quot;Leela&quot; book based on the Gyan Chaupad and it\n&gt; is very interesting and it resonates with my personal beliefs (that\n&gt; the ultimate goal of life is to reach Vaikuntha Loka and serve the\n&gt; Lord)\n&gt;\n&gt; However, I have read some reviews about his book, &quot;Tools for Tantra&quot;\n&gt; with some people saying it is a dangerous book to read.\n&gt; I am now feeling anxious because I wanted to read it, but now I am\n&gt; scared that maybe it is too esoteric to read.\n&gt;\n&gt; I have read other occult books before, but mostly by western authors\n&gt; on subjects such as summoning spirits etc- and nothing freaky or\n&gt; weird happened to me when reading those books.\n&gt;\n&gt; Any advice?\n&gt;\n&gt; Jaya Sita Raam\n&gt; Bivash\n\n\n"}}
