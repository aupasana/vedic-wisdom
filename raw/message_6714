Awesome!\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR =\r\nRao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; I have seen people who talks ab=\r\nout moksham. .. I still did not \n&gt; &gt; understand the concept of moksham.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n If it is a state of being, what is that state? Is that state defined \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nany where in Puranas? Who\n&gt; &gt; found it and being a human why I have to go f=\r\nor it?\n&gt; \n&gt; I will explain using an analogy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Once upon a time, there w=\r\nas an ocean. This ocean was vast, still and \n&gt; blissful. Then a force arose=\r\n within the ocean that disturbed it. There \n&gt; were many waves and ripples o=\r\nn the surface of the ocean. Under the \n&gt; influence of the force, the ripple=\r\ns and waves started moving rapidly. \n&gt; Instead of seeing itself as a part o=\r\nf the ocean, each ripple thought it \n&gt; was separate entity. Based on other =\r\nripples that it hit it nicely or \n&gt; abruptly, each ripple started liking so=\r\nme ripples and hating some \n&gt; ripples. Based on the previous moves, each ri=\r\npple liked moving in some \n&gt; ways and hated some moves. The ripples develop=\r\ned their own likes, \n&gt; dislikes, agendas etc. They pushed themselves to mov=\r\ne in the way they \n&gt; liked. When that happened, they were elated. When thei=\r\nr move crashed \n&gt; against the force and they were forced to move another wa=\r\ny violently, \n&gt; ripples were depressed. They kept getting elated and depres=\r\nsed, liking \n&gt; other ripples and hating them, and their likes and agendas k=\r\nept \n&gt; evolving.\n&gt; \n&gt; Some ripples said all the ripples exist within ocean =\r\nand hence started \n&gt; worshipping the ocean. Some ripples praised the power =\r\nof the oceanic \n&gt; force that was responsible for all ripples and started wo=\r\nrshipping the \n&gt; force. Some said, &quot;this force is not different from ocean.=\r\n This force is \n&gt; just a different manifestation of the ocean. This force a=\r\nnd ocean are \n&gt; one&quot;. Some even went further and said, &quot;why do I look at my=\r\nself as a \n&gt; ripple? I AM the ocean. I am a part of the ocean. I AM the oce=\r\nan.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; One day, one ripple realized that there was nothing to like or di=\r\nslike \n&gt; in any move. There was nothing to like or dislike any other ripple=\r\n. It \n&gt; realized that it was not a  ripple, but it was the ocean itself. Al=\r\nl \n&gt; other ripples it was crashing against were also it (ocean) only. The b=\r\nig \n&gt; force of the ocean that was moving everything hither tither was \n&gt; un=\r\nconfrontable and uncontrollable and one needs to just witness what it \n&gt; do=\r\nes and not try to control it.\n&gt; \n&gt; With that realization, the ripple gave u=\r\np its agendas to move here or \n&gt; there, its likes and dislikes for certain =\r\nmoves, its likes and dislikes \n&gt; for certain ripples, etc. It just remained=\r\n there on the surface, but \n&gt; looked at itself as the whole ocean and the f=\r\norce moving it as an \n&gt; uncontrollable force that was moving various parts =\r\nof it (ocean). Under \n&gt; the impact of the force, it still kept moving here =\r\nand there, hitting \n&gt; this ripple and that ripple, but it stopped resisting=\r\n or trying to move \n&gt; in a specific way. It moved for some more time and th=\r\ne ripple died down \n&gt; after a while. It merged in the ocean. Before, it tho=\r\nught it was ocean \n&gt; and not a ripple, but other ripples could see a ripple=\r\n in its place. Now \n&gt; that it died down, it was truly ocean and there was n=\r\no ripple there.\n&gt; \n&gt; Other ripples kept resisting the force, trying enforce=\r\n their agendas, \n&gt; and kept moving hither thither and take a new shape when=\r\n one shape was \n&gt; dying down. They kept revising and pursuing their agendas=\r\n. The ocean \n&gt; simply witnessed them and the force kept moving them.\n&gt; \n&gt; *=\r\n        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; In the above analogy, the ocean is known as Shiva o=\r\nr Purusha or \n&gt; Brahman/Aatman. The force within the ocean is known as Shak=\r\nti or \n&gt; Prakriti or Mahamaya. The waves and ripples are various deities, d=\r\nemons, \n&gt; human beings, animals and other beings. The movement is their tho=\r\nughts \n&gt; and actions. Moksha is what is described with one ripple at the en=\r\nd \n&gt; (from &quot;One day, one ripples realized..&quot;).\n&gt; \n&gt; All beings are constant=\r\nly revising and pursuing their agendas, with \n&gt; their own likes/dislikes fo=\r\nr some actions and likes/dislikes for other \n&gt; beings. They are elated some=\r\ntimes and depressed sometimes. When one \n&gt; realizes the uncontrollable and =\r\nunconfrontable nature of the Shakti that \n&gt; is moving all, one becomes a wi=\r\ntness to that Shakti. One may continue to \n&gt; do things to others and exist =\r\nin the body, but one does not resist the \n&gt; agenda of Shakti and submits fu=\r\nlly. One does good and bad things to \n&gt; people without like or dislike for =\r\npeople or for actions. One has no \n&gt; agenda of one&#39;s own. One is in constan=\r\nt bliss. Other people see a body, \n&gt; but one is not identifying with the bo=\r\ndy. When the momentum is over, one \n&gt; gives up body and merges in Brahman. =\r\nOne is not born again.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you go through the analogy carefully, a lot =\r\nof concepts will become \n&gt; crystal clear - Shiva, Shakti, Shiva-Shaktyaikya=\r\nta (oneness of Shiva and \n&gt; Shakti), jeeva, samskaras, jeevanmukti, moksha =\r\netc.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Les=\r\nsons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam a=\r\nnd Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;    =\r\n   Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter =\r\nID: @homam108\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------\n&gt; \n&gt; On Wed, Jun 29, 2011 at 3:39 PM, raghs wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; I have seen people who talks about moksham.
