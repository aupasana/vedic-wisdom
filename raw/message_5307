The Vedic tradition is furth=\r\ner defined as Sanatana Dharma or a universal and eternal (Sanatana) traditi=\r\non of truth and natural law (Dharma). What Veda is seeking to know is the n=\r\nature of things, ultimately the nature of our own being\nthat is connected t=\r\no the Divine presence or higher consciousness which pervades all existence.=\r\n\n\nAs such, the Vedic tradition is not content merely with belief in God or =\r\neven communion with the deity as its ultimate aim. Its goal is to know the =\r\ndeity within our own minds and hearts in the sense of this higher knowledge=\r\n born of direct perception, not as a mere mental or emotional connection, b=\r\nut one that engages our entire being to its immortal core.\n\nSuch inner know=\r\ning is not a speculative venture or a matter of salvation through faith. Ve=\r\ndic Dharma teaches specific philosophies or ways of knowledge about the dei=\r\nty. For these to really work, specific sadhanas or spiritual practices, lar=\r\ngely yogic in nature are required. Vedic Dharma does not rest upon faith at=\r\n a mass level, but spiritual practices at an individual level for achieving=\r\n the ultimate goal of life described as moksha, or liberation from the cycl=\r\ne of birth and death.\n\nOther religious, spiritual and philosophical systems=\r\n in the world also have their concerns with and their means of gaining such=\r\n inner knowledge of the deity, often put under the banner of the `religious=\r\n experience&#39; or the `mystical experience&#39;. Such experiences are also common=\r\nly referred to as `unity consciousness&#39;, though they have considerable vari=\r\neties.\n\nThe pursuit of mystical experiences has been a sidelight or rarity =\r\nin western religious traditions, and has sometimes been suppressed by them,=\r\n particularly when it challenges the authority of existing institutions. Ye=\r\nt it has been widely encouraged in India since the most ancient times. Each=\r\n follower of a particular spiritual path in India is usually encouraged to =\r\ntake up such a sadhana to contact the deity within. At the same time, since=\r\n there are clearly defined paths to higher realization in the Vedic traditi=\r\non, there is less danger\nof the practitioner falling into the confusion tha=\r\nt mystical experiences can sometimes create for those who stumble upon them=\r\n, rather than are trained to receive them.\n\nSri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya (=\r\nDr. Frank Morales) is a rare western teacher who knows both the philosophie=\r\ns and the practices of the Vedic tradition and has firsthand experience of =\r\nhow they really work. He is a highly qualified teacher, or Acharya, of Vedi=\r\nc Dharma, the first western Acharya of a western Hindu temple, not merely a=\r\nn academic looking at Vedic thought with little practical experience of how=\r\n it is applied. He has also studied in depth other religious,\nspiritual and=\r\n philosophical traditions. This provides him a much deeper level of insight=\r\n into the Vedic tradition than normally found in the vast majority of teach=\r\ners today. He takes the discussion out of the mere speculative realm to the=\r\n domain of spiritual practice, making his discussion relevant to those invo=\r\nlved in meditation and devotional disciplines as well.\n\nSri Dharma Pravarta=\r\nka Acharya focuses on the issue of pramanas or proofs, the complex yet cent=\r\nral issue of epistemology. If we want to know something, the first question=\r\n that arises is: &quot;What are our available means of legitimate knowledge?&quot; Th=\r\ne issue is particularly important relative to spiritual studies. If somethi=\r\nng Divine, infinite and eternal does exist, through what special means can =\r\nit be known? Obviously, our ordinary mind and senses are designed to know\nl=\r\nimited, finished and transient objects, though they can speculate about som=\r\nething beyond. Is there some other more direct means that we can develop in=\r\n order to do this?\n\nIn western philosophy the means of knowledge are largel=\r\ny limited to reason and the senses, and what can be extrapolated from them,=\r\n though theologies regularly bring in faith and scripture as well. The Vedi=\r\nc tradition has also accepted samadhi, or yogic perception born of the medi=\r\ntative mind, as a legitimate means of knowledge. This not only includes the=\r\n mystical experience, but allows a practical and scientific approach to it =\r\nthrough yogic disciplines.\n\nThe Vedic tradition includes the idea of script=\r\nure, or shruti, not as books to merely believe in, but as indicators and gu=\r\nidelines to a higher realization that should be employed in the context of =\r\nsadhana, or spiritual practice. The Vedic shruti is linked to the idea of s=\r\nhabda, or sacred sound, and mantra, reflecting the Divine Word and cosmic c=\r\nreative vibration. Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya examines the issue of scri=\r\npture and sacred sound quite clearly from a Vedic perspective.\n\nMost modern=\r\n Vedantic studies have focused on the Advaita Vedanta of\nShankaracharya and=\r\n his modern proponents since the time Swami Vivekananda over a century ago.=\r\n Recently, the Dvaitic and Vishishtadvaitic forms of Vedanta have also rece=\r\nived attention, which adds another dimension to these studies. Sri Dharma P=\r\nravartaka Acharya has taken a view that can embrace and honor all these sys=\r\ntems, without losing their specific value and different approaches.\n\nFor th=\r\nis examination, he has focused on one primary thinker, the work of Jiva Gos=\r\nwami, an important figure in the Vaishnava tradition about whom much has be=\r\nen written in recent years with the development of the Bhakti Yoga movement=\r\n throughout the world. Yet he grounds his study of Goswami in a greater ana=\r\nlysis of all six Vedic philosophies as well as their connections with other=\r\n philosophical and theological traditions East and West. This affords the b=\r\nook a relevance beyond India to the global issues of spiritual knowledge.\n\n=\r\nGoswami&#39;s work, like that of many Vaishnava Hindus, in turn is based on the=\r\n Bhagavata Purana, which is regarded by many Hindu scholars as the greatest=\r\n of the Puranas, as well as an important extension of the thought and insig=\r\nht of the Vedas, Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita. Western scholarship has ofte=\r\nn ignored such texts, focusing on the prime Sutras and texts of the six sys=\r\ntems of Vedic philosophy, as if there was nothing more to be considered. Th=\r\nis has limited their scope and vision in understanding Vedic philosophy, a =\r\nsituation that the\nauthor seeks to correct.\n\nThe book reflects an academic =\r\nrigor in orientation, approach and expression. It demands profound thought =\r\non the part of its reader. Yet the book also represents a new type of exper=\r\niential scholarship from westerners trained in authentic Eastern traditions=\r\n. This provides a different view than what is normally found from academics=\r\n looking at Eastern traditions from the outside.\n\nSuch `inside the traditio=\r\nn&#39; views provide a good alternative and help us frame the focus of a new de=\r\nbate, which is not simply about different philosophies or theologies, but a=\r\nbout the ultimate truth of our own existence and what our true nature as co=\r\nnscious beings really resides in. With &quot;The Vedic Way of Knowing God&quot;, and =\r\nhis own personal spiritual example, Sri Dharma Pravartaka Acharya leads us =\r\nforward in this new adventure in consciousness.\n\nDr. David Frawley\n(Pandit =\r\nVamadeva Shastri)\nAmerican Institute of Vedic Studies\nSante Fe, New Mexico,=\r\n U.S.A.\nJanuary, 2010\n\n\n&quot;The Vedic Way of Knowing God&quot;, by Sri Dharma Prava=\r\nrtaka Acharya, is available for purchase here:\n\n\nhttp://www.lulu.com/produc=\r\nt/paperback/the-vedic-way-of-knowing-god/13555030\n\n\nGive the gift of Dharma=\r\n this holiday season.  5% Discount if you purchase now!  \n\n\nRevealing the p=\r\nrofound philosophical insights of the world&#39;s most ancient spiritual philos=\r\nophy, this book not only boldly answers the question &quot;How do I know God?&quot; f=\r\nrom the distinctly Vedic (Hindu) perspective, but also explores the further=\r\n issues of what it even means to be able to know God.
