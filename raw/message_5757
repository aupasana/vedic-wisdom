Some people also offer whole=\r\n toor dal \nfor Mars (small pigeon peas).\n\n*        *        *\n\nThis reminds=\r\n me of one incident. In my daily Chandi homam, one of the \nstandard substan=\r\nces I offer is dried Tulsi (holy basil) leaves, bought \nat a local Indian s=\r\ntore. Though Tulasi is dear to Vishnu, She is said to \nbe disliked by Ganes=\r\nha (there is a Puranic story for that). So, Tulasi \nleaves are nishiddha (p=\r\nrohibited) as an offering to Ganesha. I usually \nstick to all the rules I a=\r\nm aware of. So I offer Tulasi only to the \nMother and never to Ganesha.\n\nOn=\r\ne Friday during last navaratris, I took a day off from work and spent \nit i=\r\nn a special sadhana. I spent from early morning till 2 pm doing \nhomam to L=\r\nakshmi and Narayana with continuous repetition of Narayana \nHridayam and La=\r\nkshmi Hridayam and then spent the rest of the day \nchanting the same pair o=\r\nf stotras over and over again. In the beginning \nof the day, when I was mak=\r\ning offerings to Ganesha in fire, I put Tulasi \nleaves in fire unconsciousl=\r\ny (they were next to me and I grabbed them \nwithout thinking). After making=\r\n the offering, I realized my mistake, and \nmentally apologized. But I got a=\r\n clear sense that there was nothing \nwrong or nothing to worry. Moreover, I=\r\n had my best experience ever \nduring homam, on that day.\n\n*        *       =\r\n *\n\nDo the sadhana with a simple, innocent and pure heart, without expectin=\r\ng \nany selfish results. Then, whatever you do, whether granted by \nscriptur=\r\nes or prohibited, will become a pure offering to the Lord. The \nphysical ma=\r\nterials we offer to Lord are just a proxy and the real \noffering is our att=\r\nitude and thoughts that accompany them. Of course, \nfollow the rules when y=\r\nou can, but do not worry too much about the \nproxy. Worry about the real of=\r\nfering instead!\n\n*        *        *\n\nIf one thinks and analyzes too much, =\r\nthe onus is on that person to \nanalyze correctly and come to the right conc=\r\nlusion. If one is too \nknowledgeable, the onus is on that person to apply t=\r\nhe knowledge.\n\nOne who is not that knowledgeable and does not think much an=\r\nd simply \ndoes sadhana with a simple and innocent attitude and a sense of \n=\r\nsurrender is blessed. The onus is on guru and Lord to make that person \ncro=\r\nss the ocean of samsara.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free J=\r\nyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short=\r\n Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=\r\n\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirit=\r\nuality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n--------------------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, A=\r\ncharyulu &lt;acharyulug@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Shri Narasimha Garu,\n&gt;\n&gt;    Can I=\r\n offer Red Oleander (=C3=A0=C2=B0=C5=BD=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=B1=C3=A0=\r\n=C2=B0=C2=B0 =C3=A0=C2=B0=E2=80=94=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=A8=C3=A0=C2=B1=C3=A0=C2=\r\n=B0=C2=A8=C3=A0=C2=B1=E2=80=A1=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B0=C3=A0=C2=B1 \n&gt; =C3=A0=C2=\r\n=B0=C2=AA=C3=A0=C2=B1=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B5=C3=A0=C2=B1=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B5=C3=A0=\r\n=C2=B1=C3=A0=C2=B0=C2=B2=C3=A0=C2=B1) during Kuja Homa besides Til and Puff=\r\ned rice. \n&gt; Actually the flowers look pink or rose color.
