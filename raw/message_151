You started a very good topic. We will be look=\r\ning forward to\nyour nice observations on some common mistakes. I am followi=\r\nng your\nmails for last 6 years and I notice rapid increase of your satwik\nb=\r\nhava and decrease of rajasik bhava as reflected in your posting and\nreplies=\r\n.  \n\nLast time when we were doing chandi path (to which you kindly guided\nm=\r\ne), I requested priests to do a sampusti with saranagata\ndinaarta...... The=\r\nre were ten priests, some of them were young. And\nthe sampusti was done by =\r\neach of them on rotation. To my disbelieve,\nsome of the younger priests wer=\r\ne reciting the verse as &quot;saranagata\ndina arta......sarba &lt;khaayati&gt;rr hare =\r\ndevi narayani namastute&quot;. The\npronunciation was such that khaayti was sound=\r\ning more like &quot;fame&quot; than\n&quot;loss&quot;. I did not correct them as that would hurt=\r\n their pride - being\nborn to brahmin families. Moreover I did not have any =\r\nwish to get\nfull-filled from the chandi-patha. So, I thought to leave it to=\r\n mother\n- while correcting the recitation myself during my ahutis.\n\nBest re=\r\ngards,\nSwadhin  \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Ra=\r\no&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste friends,\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa once=\r\n said that even Vedas are corrupted\nthese days. It is the nature of Kali yu=\r\nga to corrupt everything.\n&gt;  \n&gt; It is my feeling that many people, includin=\r\ng highly learned Vedic\nscholars, pronounce some sounds in Sanskrit mantras =\r\n(including Veda\nmantras) incorrectly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Of course, pronunciation is not=\r\n everything. Having devotion and the\nspirit of surrender to god is even mor=\r\ne important. However,\npronunciation is a factor too. Especially, correct pr=\r\nonunciation is\nvery important in Veda mantras. Wrong pronunciation of a Ved=\r\na mantra\ncan stop one from the most complete experience of the mantra. In f=\r\nact,\nwe have a lot of people who can memorize and repeat Veda mantras, but\n=\r\nvery few who can actually &quot;experience&quot; a mantra.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Over the next few mo=\r\nnths, I will write my views on correct\npronunciation and point out some com=\r\nmon errors. If you do not think\nthat correct pronunciation is important or =\r\nif you disagree with my\nassessment of the errors or if you do not want to c=\r\nhange your\npronunciation, please ignore my writings on this subject. On the=\r\n other\nhand, if you are open to changing your pronunciation, please give a\n=\r\nconsideration to my views and adopt my suggestions if you find them\nappropr=\r\niate.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; Take the &quot;t&quot; sound at the end of the =\r\nwords like &quot;prachodayaat&quot;, &quot;ava\npurastaat&quot;, &quot;sahasrapaat&quot; etc. Most priests=\r\n and scholars pronounce\nthis sound incorrectly. They change &quot;t&quot; to somethin=\r\ng like &quot;tu&quot; or\n&quot;ttu&quot; or &quot;ti&quot; or &quot;tti&quot;. There is a reason why this corruptio=\r\nn came\ninto practice, but it is a corruption nevertheless.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In &quot;pracho=\r\ndayaat&quot;, the sound &quot;yaat&quot; as one letter/syllable/akshara.\nIf you change it =\r\ninto &quot;yaattu&quot; or &quot;yaatu&quot; by adding a vowel sound at\nthe end, it becomes two=\r\n aksharas. This increases the number of\naksharas, changes the chhandas and =\r\nchanges the meaning also. You may\nstill experience something when meditatin=\r\ng on the mantra, but you will\nnever experience the mantra to the fullest wi=\r\nth that pronunciation.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Akshara means &quot;unperished&quot;. Vowels (swaras) ar=\r\ne the praana (life\nforce) of an akshara. If you have just a consonant witho=\r\nut a vowel\nafter it, then it has no praana. It is kshara and NOT an akshara=\r\n. It\nperishes. For example, if you pronounce &quot;t&quot; as is (without adding any\n=\r\nsounds to it), you cannot sustain the sound and the listener cannot\ndeciphe=\r\nr what exactly you pronounced. It has no life force.\n&gt;  \n&gt; In &quot;prachodayaat=\r\n&quot;, the whole sound &quot;yaat&quot; is one akshara. Because\n&quot;t&quot; has no praana by itse=\r\nlf, it simply joins to the akshara &quot;yaa&quot;\n(which has the vowel &quot;aa&quot; as its p=\r\nraana) and becomes part of that\nakshara. In chhandas, &quot;yaat&quot; is considered =\r\none letter (one guru). When\nyou pronounce &quot;yaat&quot; correctly, it is difficult=\r\n for the listener to\nknow for sure whether you said &quot;yaat&quot; or &quot;yaak&quot; or &quot;ya=\r\nan&quot;. It is\npossible if one listens carefully, but otherwise difficult. The =\r\n&quot;t&quot; at\nthe end is a very quick and abrupt transient sound without praana. S=\r\no\nit tough to hear clearly.\n&gt;  \n&gt; This makes people add some vowel to it (l=\r\nike &quot;u&quot; or &quot;a&quot; or &quot;o&quot; or\n&quot;i&quot; or some other vowel sound in between them) so =\r\nthat the &quot;t&quot; sound\ngets a praana and becomes clearly audible. It suddenly b=\r\necomes an\nakshara and the chhandas changes.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Probably, some big teache=\r\nr started pronouncing &quot;yaat&quot; as &quot;yaatu&quot; so\nthat &quot;t&quot; gets a praana of itself=\r\n and becomes very clear to hear, so\nthat his students would not get confuse=\r\nd when learning. Probably the\nstudents thought the mantra was &quot;yaatu&quot; (inst=\r\nead of &quot;yaat&quot;) and got\nused to that mis-pronunciation. Probably, that becam=\r\ne a standard\npractice after a couple of centuries.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you pronounce t=\r\nhe English word &quot;path&quot;, you do not change it to\n&quot;paaththu&quot;. You say &quot;th&quot; at=\r\n the end of &quot;path&quot; as a consonant and leave\nit there. You don&#39;t force an vo=\r\nwel sound to be added at the end. The\nsame thing holds for &quot;t&quot; in &quot;prachoda=\r\nyaat&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; What I said about words ending in co=\r\nnsonants applies to all\nconsonants and not just &quot;t&quot;, though &quot;t&quot; is more com=\r\nmonly encountered.\nThere can be words that end in &quot;n&quot; or &quot;k&quot; etc also. Ther=\r\ne also, people\nnormally add an artificial vowel sound at the end and end up=\r\n changing\nthe chhandas and altering the flow of energy in the mantra. That =\r\nis\nalso wrong.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; One more common mistake is t=\r\nhe sound &quot;tha&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).\nMost south Indians pronounce thi=\r\ns as &quot;dha&quot; (as in &quot;dhana&quot; =3D money). In\nTelugu and Kannada scripts, the sy=\r\nmbols of tha and dha looks very\nsimilar and just one dot in the middle is d=\r\nifferent. It is possible\nthat some people started mispronouncing this sound=\r\n because of their\ninability to see the dot and others started following. No=\r\nw pronouncing\ntha as dha became mainstream and one pronouncing correctly wi=\r\nll be the\nodd person out.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Sanskrit is not English. We never have two =\r\ndifferent symbols for the\nsame sound or two different sounds for the same s=\r\nymbol. The letters\n&quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; are different and their sounds are diffe=\r\nrent too.\nPronounce &quot;t&quot; (as in &quot;tanu&quot; =3D body or &quot;taamra&quot; =3D copper) with=\r\n a\nstress/aspiration to get &quot;th&quot; (as in &quot;kathaa&quot; =3D story).\n&gt;  \n&gt; In the s=\r\nankalpa before many poojas, people say &quot;dharmaartha kaama\nmoksha chaturvidh=\r\na purushaartha siddhyartham&quot;. This means &quot;for\nattaining the purusharthas (p=\r\nurposes of human existence) - dharma\n(fulfilling duties), artha (work and m=\r\noney), kaama (fulfilling\ndesires) and moksha (developing detachment)&quot;. Most=\r\n people end up\npronouncing &quot;dharmaartha kaama moksha&quot; as &quot;dharmaardha kaama=\r\n moksha&quot;.\nIt means &quot;half of dharma, kaama and moksha&quot;. Even &quot;siddhardham&quot; m=\r\neans\n&quot;half attainment&quot; and &quot;purushaardha&quot; means &quot;half a human&quot;.\nMis-pronunc=\r\niation in this sankalpa is a bad mistake and I have seen it\ncommitted by ma=\r\nny many trained priests!\n&gt;  \n&gt; When you read Vaidika/Taantrika/Pouranika ma=\r\nntras, pay attention to\nthe difference between &quot;tha&quot; and &quot;dha&quot; and learn to=\r\n pronounce them\ndifferently. When you see &quot;tha&quot; or &quot;dha&quot; in the mantra, pay=\r\n extra\nattention to ensure that you are not confusing tha for dha.\n&gt;  \n&gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; There are several other mistakes (in my view) commo=\r\nnly made by most\npeople in the pronunciation of Sanskrit mantras. I will be=\r\n pointing\nthem out slowly in the next few months, whenever the Mother allow=\r\ns me to.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Please give me your consideration and take my input into\ncon=\r\nsideration in altering your pronunciation (if you are open to\nthat). If you=\r\n don&#39;t find any sense in what I am saying or want to\ncontinue as taught by =\r\nyour gurus, I can understand that. I am not here\nto change everybody&#39;s pron=\r\nunciation. But, because She inspired me to\nshare my thoughts with the world=\r\n, I am guessing that there are SOME\nwho are destined to change their pronun=\r\nciation based on my views. That\nis why I am writing these mails.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If y=\r\nou do not like this discussion, I am sorry and just ignore this\nidiot!\n&gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; Do Ganapathi Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;=\r\n Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyot=\r\nish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Cent=\r\nre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
