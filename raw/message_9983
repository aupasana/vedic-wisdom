As you would see in comments a=\r\nnd facebook, this series has led to\nmany Muslims embracing the goodness of =\r\nHinduism. In words of Md Khaja:\n\n&quot;Through Swami Vivekananda, I got to know =\r\nthe basics of Sanskrit (Hindu)\nPhilosophy. But, through Agniveer site I got=\r\n to know the whole of Sanskrit\n(Hindu) philosophy. &quot;\n\nErshad Hossain says: =\r\n&quot;In reviving Hinduism or the Sanatanadharma, we will\nbring peace to this wo=\r\nrld once again.&quot;\n\n(continued from http://agniveer.com/why-i-am-proud-to-be-=\r\nhindu-part-1/)\n*Reason 6: Hinduism- Research friendly, reform friendly*\n\nHi=\r\nnduism has no book, no person, no history, no ideology to defend. It does\nn=\r\not matter whether you worship through lighting of agarbatti, or conduct\nHaw=\r\nan, or ring bells in temple, or recite name with eyes closed in\nisolation, =\r\nor keep fasts, or enjoy sweets in festivals.\n\n*The core of Hinduism is defi=\r\nned in Yajurveda 1.5 (Idam Aham Anritaat\nSatyam Upaimi)- =93 I strive to re=\r\nject the non-true and accept the true in\nthis present moment. So Hinduism i=\r\ns all about living in present and\nchoosing what is best right now, irrespec=\r\ntive of what may have appeared\nright in past.* It is all about making that =\r\nincremental progress every\nmoment like in any research-based discipline.\n\nH=\r\ninduism doesn=E2=80=99t demand you to defend what you have stood for in pas=\r\nt.\nYou must be able to defend what you are standing for right now. And if y=\r\nou\ncannot defend, then simply evolve.\n\nThus research and knowledge-enhancem=\r\nent is encouraged unlike many\nreligions. In fact there are many verses whic=\r\nh specifically state that\nunless one is on a constant path of seeking newer=\r\n and latest knowledge,\nwisdom will ever remain elusive. Knowledge alone lib=\r\nerates.\n\nI am not aware of any religion that specifically states that mathe=\r\nmatics\nand astronomy must be mastered to have rightly-directed understandin=\r\ng of\nGod, soul, spiritualism, after-life and related topics.\n\nI am not awar=\r\ne of any religion that states that it does not matter what you\nbelieve in r=\r\night now, even if that belief amounts to blatant blasphemy.\nWhat matters is=\r\n that you are on a genuine pursuit of knowledge increment.\n\nI am not aware =\r\nof any religion that demands you to keep changing, keep\nevolving, keep impr=\r\noving, keep innovating to choose even better ways out.\nThat demands you to =\r\nkill the past and live in present to make a better\nfuture. That proactively=\r\n encourages reforms in every aspect of living\ninstead of clinging to archai=\r\nc interpretations of some =E2=80=98divine=E2=80=99 message.\n\nThat is why *e=\r\nven though many social evils got into Hindu society over its\nlong history (=\r\nlongest in world), at the same time, reform movements also\nemerged in paral=\r\nlel to fight these evils.*And that is why Hindu society has\nbeen so vocal i=\r\nn admitting that social evils like casteism, Sati, polygamy\nand dowry are i=\r\nndeed social evils. Thus the Hindu society proudly made laws\nto destroy the=\r\nse social evils, and considered these reforms as genuine\nHinduism.\n\n*That i=\r\ns why saints like Kabir, Nanak and Dayanand Saraswati are held in\nsuch high=\r\n esteem by Hindu society even though they critically challenged\nthe prevail=\r\ning social norms of their times.*\n\nThat is why, Hinduism is not a religion =\r\nin first place. It is simply an\nenlightened way of life.\n\nSo if you are a s=\r\ncientist, social reformer, researcher, inventor or\ndiscoverer, you are a Hi=\r\nndu. It does not matter what your theological or\nreligious beliefs are.\n\nA =\r\nNewton is a Hindu, Einstein is a Hindu, APJ Abdul Kalam is a Hindu, Steve\nJ=\r\nobs is a Hindu, every sensible person is a Hindu. More the sensibility,\nmor=\r\ne the Hinduism within him.\n*Reason 7: Hinduism- Journey of personal discove=\r\nry*\n\nThe fundamental principle of Hinduism is that *root of sorrow lies in\n=\r\nignorance (Avidya). And remedy is wisdom (Vidya)*. This wisdom cannot be\nex=\r\nternally imposed. It has to be discovered within by one&#39;s own efforts.\nThro=\r\nugh knowledge, action and contemplation. The external tools may be\nhelpful =\r\nin the process. But nonetheless, each of us has to undertake its\nown journe=\r\ny through its own initiative.\n\nAnd since each of us is so different and so =\r\nspecial, spoon-feeding and\nexpecting to blindly adopt any unverified truth =\r\nwould be an insult to our\nbeing human.\n\n*Thus all Hindu texts are mere reco=\r\nmmendations. And they clearly state that\nultimate authority is one&#39;s own se=\r\nlf.*\n\nYes, Vedas are considered Supreme in Hinduism. Some consider Gita to =\r\nbe\ntheir guide. Some admire Ramayan and Mahabharat. But none is a compulsio=\r\nn. *The\nonly compulsion is that you sincerely undertake a journey of person=\r\nal\ndiscovery and allow others the freedom to take a similar journey.*\n*Reas=\r\non 8: Hinduism- synonym of practical tolerance*\n\nThat takes us to the next =\r\nreason why Hinduism is source of my pride.\nHinduism is all about tolerance.=\r\n Since each one of us has to individually\ntake up the journey of personal d=\r\niscovery, and each one of us is a\ndifferent being, Hinduism acknowledges th=\r\nat paths we choose are bound to be\ndifferent. So far there is no threat or =\r\ndeceit involved, Hinduism\nencourages to respect diversity of beliefs and wa=\r\nys of living. *A so-called\nnon-Hindu is not supposed to live like a second =\r\nclass citizen in a Hindu\nRashtra or Hindu nation.*\n\n*That is why since time=\r\n immemorial, Hindustan or Bharat or Aryavart or\nIndia has been the cradle t=\r\nhat nurtured a variety of theologies. There are\nno separate rules for Hindu=\r\n, Muslim or Christian in a Hindu code of\nconduct. This is in stark contrast=\r\n with many religions that clearly state\nthat only followers of their set of=\r\n superstitions are the special ones.*\n\nIt is shamefully surprising to know =\r\nthat even in 21st century there are\nsuch fanatic countries that debar peopl=\r\ne of other faith to build their\nplaces of worship, or visit their so-called=\r\n Holy cities. In such intolerant\nsocieties, punishments for crime against w=\r\nomen, Jews, Christians, Hindus,\nMuslims are different. The rights of people=\r\n to hold positions of\nresponsibility is dependent on their religion. This h=\r\nas been the way of the\nwest for last 1000 years.\n\nIndia, on contrary, owing=\r\n to its Hindu foundation, has been an icon of\ntolerance. We have had severa=\r\nl Muslim Presidents despite more than 80%\npopulation being Hindu. Current v=\r\nice-president is a Muslim. Current chief\nof ruling party in India is Christ=\r\nian. Current Defence Minister of India is\na Christian. The captain of India=\r\nn Cricket team for a long time has been a\nMuslim. The Chief of Army has bee=\r\nn a Christian. Head of Intelligence Bureau\nis a Muslim. And these people ha=\r\nve been adulated by Hindus irrespective of\ntheir religion. The Kumbh Mela 2=\r\n013- greatest religious event of Hindu\nmajority of India- was led by a Musl=\r\nim. The top Bollywood stars are Muslims.\n\n*I am not sure how many countries=\r\n in world can showcase such a level of\ntolerance and respect for all faiths=\r\n. The credit goes to the Hindu\nfoundation of the nation.* This makes Hindus=\r\ntan the most unique in entire\nworld.\n\n*(Its a different matter that this to=\r\nlerance sometimes is misused to\npoliticize it into minority appeasement. Th=\r\nis is becoming an increasingly\nserious trend in India in last few decades c=\r\nausing a lot of communal\ndisharmony. The moment a special favor is given on=\r\n basis of caste or\nreligion, that amounts to appeasement and Hinduism is st=\r\nrongly against it.\nRespect all and respect self without discrimination =E2=\r\n=80=93 this is the mantra\nof Hinduism.)*\n*Reason 9: Essence over Symbols, R=\r\nituals and Words*\n\nWhen one thinks of religion, the first thing that comes =\r\nin mind is a\nspecific set of rituals and practices specific to the follower=\r\ns of that\nreligion. For example, Muslims have a specific language for Namaz=\r\n and\nAzaan, or would keep beard in specific manner, or would have a specifi=\r\nc\nvariety of cap and clothing and so on. A Christian would wear a cross\naro=\r\nund his neck, or get baptized in a particular format. In case of\nHinduism a=\r\ns well, there are several rituals. In fact there are many more\nrituals, sym=\r\nbols and words in Hinduism than any other religion. That is\nwhat gives Indi=\r\na its vibrant colors, its rich cultural heritage and makes\nit the most live=\r\nly and diverse country in the world.\n\n*But there is a big difference. In Hi=\r\nnduism, no symbol, ritual or word is\nstatic in time or place. These change =\r\nwith time and place.* So a Tamil,\nBengali, Punjabi, Gujarati or Bihari Hind=\r\nu would have different prayers,\ndifferent religious symbols, different ways=\r\n of worship. In some other\nreligion this may amount to blasphemy and call f=\r\nor strict punishments. But\nin Hinduism this is not merely accepted but enco=\r\nuraged. Because they would\nall point to same essence of seeing Supreme with=\r\nin all and all within\nSupreme. Since He has infinite qualities, the ways to=\r\n explore, celebrate or\nremember Him must also be infinite.\n\nThis is what ma=\r\nkes India so dynamic. This is what brings unity in\ndiversity. This is exact=\r\nly the reason why India is so culturally rich. Our\nrituals, symbols and pra=\r\nyers change from place to place and time to time\nand yet we direct them to =\r\nOne. This is what makes Hinduism so fresh, so\nevolving, so purposeful, so p=\r\nractical.\n\nIn fact the name Hindu itself is time-bound. The word does not e=\r\nxist in\nVedas, Ramayan, Mahabharat, Upanishads or any other scripture. It i=\r\ns a word\nof recent origin. However, the essence is same =E2=80=93 to adopt =\r\nthe roots of\nenlightened living. Since Hinduism is the oldest and natural r=\r\neligion of\nevery human being, there was never a reason to have a special wo=\r\nrd for the\nreligion. Manushya Dharma or Maanav Dharma (Humanity) is the mor=\r\ne accurate\nterm for Hinduism. Or Arya (noble person) is a good term. For ag=\r\nes these\nterms sufficed followers of natural human religion. *It was only a=\r\nfter\npeople started following a specific book or God or prophet that they f=\r\nound\nthe need to discover new terms to identity their cults.* *And then the=\r\n\nculture of giving names to religions erupted. So Hindu became a term to\ndi=\r\nfferentiate from anyone who considers disbelief in a particular book as a\ns=\r\nin.*\n\nBut irrespective of that, and regardless of whether we call ourselves=\r\n Hindu\nor Arya or Humans or Rational Humans, we still focus on essence over=\r\n\nsymbols. *Love of mother is same regardless of whether you call Amma, or\nM=\r\nummy, or Maa. There is no sin in choosing a different name for mother or\nmo=\r\nther religion or mother philosophy. Fools fight over symbols. Hindus love\nf=\r\nor essence.*\n*Reason 10: Nothing beats the Vedas- the foundation of Hinduis=\r\nm*\n\nI have read in depth all major religious and philosophical texts of the=\r\n\nworld. They all contain great wisdom. Be it Bible or Quran or Purans- they=\r\n\nall extol to see the Supreme as supreme goal and live a life of\naccountabi=\r\nlity. Hats off to writers of these books.\n\n*But nothing beats Vedas in term=\r\ns of variety and depth of wisdom. The\nroughly 20,000 mantras of Vedas cover=\r\n everything that a human would ever\nrequire* =E2=80=93 sociology, science, =\r\nmind control, health, technology,\neducation, management, purpose of life, m=\r\nethods of analysis, finance,\neconomics etc. *There are no stories or histor=\r\ny unlike other books. There\nare no claims of miracles. Nor there is any thr=\r\neat for accepting whatever\nis written.*\n\nAnd yes, earth is round in Vedas. =\r\nSun does not move around earth in Vedas.\nThere are no angels and Satans in =\r\nVedas. There is no Adam & Eve eating some\nfruit in Vedas. God does not send=\r\n prophets in Vedas. God is not a human\nlike creature sitting on a throne in=\r\n Vedas. There is no city called Heaven\nor Hell in Vedic map of universe. Th=\r\nere is no test that is being conducted\non us. There is no destiny that has =\r\nalready been hardcoded for us.\n\nOn contrary, *Vedas extol to discover the t=\r\nruths through research &\nanalysis. They urge us to change our destiny throu=\r\ngh thoughts and actions.\nThey demand us to be rational and scientific.*\n\nAn=\r\nd yet, Vedas do not say that one who believes in unscientific\nsuperstitions=\r\n of Heaven, Hell, Judgement Day, Angels, Satans, Adam, Eve,\nMiracles etc sh=\r\nould be ridiculed or punished in any manner. Instead they\nappeal for unity =\r\nof all irrespective of personal or theological\nbeliefs. *Intent\nmatters, no=\r\nt beliefs.*\n\nI admit this may be a personal reason that you do not concur w=\r\nith because\nyou could never get a chance to study Vedas properly. But after=\r\n my years of\nresearch in Vedas as well as all other major texts of world, I=\r\n am yet to\nfind a book that surpasses Vedas in its completeness, scientific=\r\n spirit and\nlife-changing power. The foundation of Hinduism is more solid, =\r\nmore strong,\nmore reliable, more powerful than anything else I know. And if=\r\n I also add\nalong with Vedas the other Hindu gems- Gita, Upanishads & Darsh=\r\nans- then\nnothing comes at par for an evolved mind.\n\nSo I have no option bu=\r\nt to be proud to be Hindu. My pride lies in my\nconduct of life as per virtu=\r\nes of patience, tolerance, self-control and\nscientific temper. My pride lie=\r\ns in loving entire humanity. My pride lies\nin defending against any form of=\r\n injustice. My pride lies in promoting\nscientific way of living to extent p=\r\nossible, and yet be loving of those who\ndisagree with me. My pride lies in =\r\nliving up to the standards of an\nenlightened Hindu. My pride lies in my hon=\r\nest humility.\n\nYes, I am proud to be Hindu. And I do wish that entire human=\r\nity embraces\nits root and become proud to be Hindu.\nFour Vedas English Comp=\r\nlete- Agniveer (E-Book)[image: The 4 Vedas in\nEnglish]*BUY NOW*&lt;http://agni=\r\nkart.com/vedas-in-english/four-vedas-rigveda-yajurveda-samaveda-atharvaveda=\r\n-english-complete-agniveer&gt;\n\nThe 4 Vedas Complete (Hindi) (Proper Book Form=\r\nat)[image: The 4 Vedas in\nEnglish]*BUY NOW* &lt;http://agnikart.com/complete-s=\r\net-of-4-vedas-hindi&gt;\n\n\n*If you do not wish to receive any further communica=\r\ntions, please mail us\non unsubscribe_list_ses@... &lt;unsubscribe_lis=\r\nt_ses@...&gt;*\n\n*Agniveer, JP/Post Box . 9655, New Delhi 110 058, Ind=\r\nia*\n\n\n-- \n\nRegards\nSachanand\nAgnikart\nM: +91 8800 958058\nM: +91 8800 240435=\r\n\n\r\n--f46d04426f1c6468af04ee18467a\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans-seri=\r\nf;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;center&gt;&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;&lt;tbody&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;To view a=\r\n web version of this message,=A0&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://agniveer.com/why-i-am-pro=\r\nud-to-be-hindu-part-2/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;click here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt;\n&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;=\r\n&lt;/table&gt;&lt;/center&gt;&lt;p&gt;Namaste&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;We are pleased to present second part of =\r\nthe path-breaking series on Hinduism.

More the sensibility, more the Hinduism within him.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=\r\n=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason 7: Hindui=\r\nsm- Journey of personal discovery&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0)=\r\n;font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;The fundamental principle of =\r\nHinduism is that=A0&lt;strong&gt;root of sorrow lies in ignorance (Avidya). And r=\r\nemedy is wisdom (Vidya)&lt;/strong&gt;. This wisdom cannot be externally imposed.=\r\n It has to be discovered within by one&#39;s own efforts. Through knowledge=\r\n, action and contemplation. The external tools may be helpful in the proces=\r\ns. But nonetheless, each of us has to undertake its own journey through its=\r\n own initiative.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans-=\r\nserif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;And since each of us is so different and so specia=\r\nl, spoon-feeding and expecting to blindly adopt any unverified truth would =\r\nbe an insult to our being human.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);fon=\r\nt-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Thus all Hindu texts are =\r\nmere recommendations. And they clearly state that ultimate authority is one=\r\n&#39;s own self.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:ari=\r\nal,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;Yes, Vedas are considered Supreme in Hind=\r\nuism. Some consider Gita to be their guide. Some admire Ramayan and Mahabha=\r\nrat. But none is a compulsion.=A0&lt;strong&gt;The only compulsion is that you si=\r\nncerely undertake a journey of personal discovery and allow others the free=\r\ndom to take a similar journey.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;h3 style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,=\r\n0,0);font-family:arial,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason 8: Hinduism- synonym of p=\r\nractical tolerance&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:=\r\narial,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;That takes us to the next reason why Hi=\r\nnduism is source of my pride. Hinduism is all about tolerance. Since each o=\r\nne of us has to individually take up the journey of personal discovery, and=\r\n each one of us is a different being, Hinduism acknowledges that paths we c=\r\nhoose are bound to be different. So far there is no threat or deceit involv=\r\ned, Hinduism encourages to respect diversity of beliefs and ways of living.=\r\n=A0&lt;strong&gt;A so-called non-Hindu is not supposed to live like a second clas=\r\ns citizen in a Hindu Rashtra or Hindu nation.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;That =\r\nis why since time immemorial, Hindustan or Bharat or Aryavart or India has =\r\nbeen the cradle that nurtured a variety of theologies. There are no separat=\r\ne rules for Hindu, Muslim or Christian in a Hindu code of conduct. This is =\r\nin stark contrast with many religions that clearly state that only follower=\r\ns of their set of superstitions are the special ones.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;It is=\r\n shamefully surprising to know that even in 21st century there are such fan=\r\natic countries that debar people of other faith to build their places of wo=\r\nrship, or visit their so-called Holy cities. In such intolerant societies, =\r\npunishments for crime against women, Jews, Christians, Hindus, Muslims are =\r\ndifferent. The rights of people to hold positions of responsibility is depe=\r\nndent on their religion. This has been the way of the west for last 1000 ye=\r\nars.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans-serif;fo=\r\nnt-size:13px&quot;&gt;India, on contrary, owing to its Hindu foundation, has been a=\r\nn icon of tolerance. We have had several Muslim Presidents despite more tha=\r\nn 80% population being Hindu. Current vice-president is a Muslim. Current c=\r\nhief of ruling party in India is Christian. Current Defence Minister of Ind=\r\nia is a Christian. The captain of Indian Cricket team for a long time has b=\r\neen a Muslim. The Chief of Army has been a Christian. Head of Intelligence =\r\nBureau is a Muslim. And these people have been adulated by Hindus irrespect=\r\nive of their religion. The Kumbh Mela 2013- greatest religious event of Hin=\r\ndu majority of India- was led by a Muslim. The top Bollywood stars are Musl=\r\nims.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-s=\r\nize:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I am not sure how many countries in world can showcase=\r\n such a level of tolerance and respect for all faiths. The credit goes to t=\r\nhe Hindu foundation of the nation.&lt;/strong&gt;=A0This makes Hindustan the most=\r\n unique in entire world.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family=\r\n:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;(Its a different matter that this tol=\r\nerance sometimes is misused to politicize it into minority appeasement. Thi=\r\ns is becoming an increasingly serious trend in India in last few decades ca=\r\nusing a lot of communal disharmony. The moment a special favor is given on =\r\nbasis of caste or religion, that amounts to appeasement and Hinduism is str=\r\nongly against it. Respect all and respect self without discrimination =E2=\r\n=80=93 this is the mantra of Hinduism.)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,=\r\n0,0);font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reason 9: Ess=\r\nence over Symbols, Rituals and Words&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p&gt;When one thinks of rel=\r\nigion, the first thing that comes in mind is a specific set of rituals and =\r\npractices specific to the followers of that religion. For example, Muslims =\r\nhave a specific language for Namaz and Azaan, or would keep beard in specif=\r\nic manner, or would have a specific variety of cap and clothing and so on. =\r\nA Christian would wear a cross around his neck, or get baptized in a partic=\r\nular format. In case of Hinduism as well, there are several rituals. In fac=\r\nt there are many more rituals, symbols and words in Hinduism than any other=\r\n religion. That is what gives India its vibrant colors, its rich cultural h=\r\neritage and makes it the most lively and diverse country in the world.&lt;/p&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But there is a big difference. In Hinduism, no symbol, ritual or=\r\n word is static in time or place. These change with time and place.&lt;/strong=\r\n&gt;=A0So a Tamil, Bengali, Punjabi, Gujarati or Bihari Hindu would have diffe=\r\nrent prayers, different religious symbols, different ways of worship. In so=\r\nme other religion this may amount to blasphemy and call for strict punishme=\r\nnts. But in Hinduism this is not merely accepted but encouraged. Because th=\r\ney would all point to same essence of seeing Supreme within all and all wit=\r\nhin Supreme. Since He has infinite qualities, the ways to explore, celebrat=\r\ne or remember Him must also be infinite.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;This is what makes India so=\r\n dynamic. This is what brings unity in diversity. This is exactly the reaso=\r\nn why India is so culturally rich. Our rituals, symbols and prayers change =\r\nfrom place to place and time to time and yet we direct them to One. This is=\r\n what makes Hinduism so fresh, so evolving, so purposeful, so practical.&lt;/p=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size=\r\n:13px&quot;&gt;In fact the name Hindu itself is time-bound. The word does not exist=\r\n in Vedas, Ramayan, Mahabharat, Upanishads or any other scripture. It is a =\r\nword of recent origin. However, the essence is same =E2=80=93 to adopt the =\r\nroots of enlightened living. Since Hinduism is the oldest and natural relig=\r\nion of every human being, there was never a reason to have a special word f=\r\nor the religion. Manushya Dharma or Maanav Dharma (Humanity) is the more ac=\r\ncurate term for Hinduism. Or Arya (noble person) is a good term. For ages t=\r\nhese terms sufficed followers of natural human religion.=A0&lt;strong&gt;It was o=\r\nnly after people started following a specific book or God or prophet that t=\r\nhey found the need to discover new terms to identity their cults.&lt;/strong&gt;=\r\n=A0&lt;strong&gt;And then the culture of giving names to religions erupted. So Hi=\r\nndu became a term to differentiate from anyone who considers disbelief in a=\r\n particular book as a sin.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font=\r\n-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;p&gt;But irrespective of that, and r=\r\negardless of whether we call ourselves Hindu or Arya or Humans or Rational =\r\nHumans, we still focus on essence over symbols.=A0&lt;strong&gt;Love of mother is=\r\n same regardless of whether you call Amma, or Mummy, or Maa. There is no si=\r\nn in choosing a different name for mother or mother religion or mother phil=\r\nosophy. Fools fight over symbols. Hindus love for essence.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;&lt;h3 style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans-serif&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Reas=\r\non 10: Nothing beats the Vedas- the foundation of Hinduism&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;&lt;p =\r\nstyle=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;I ha=\r\nve read in depth all major religious and philosophical texts of the world. =\r\nThey all contain great wisdom. Be it Bible or Quran or Purans- they all ext=\r\nol to see the Supreme as supreme goal and live a life of accountability. Ha=\r\nts off to writers of these books.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-fam=\r\nily:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;But nothing beats Vedas in ter=\r\nms of variety and depth of wisdom. The roughly 20,000 mantras of Vedas cove=\r\nr everything that a human would ever require&lt;/strong&gt;=A0=E2=80=93 sociology=\r\n, science, mind control, health, technology, education, management, purpose=\r\n of life, methods of analysis, finance, economics etc.=A0&lt;strong&gt;There are =\r\nno stories or history unlike other books. There are no claims of miracles. =\r\nNor there is any threat for accepting whatever is written.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;&lt;p=\r\n&gt;And yes, earth is round in Vedas. Sun does not move around earth in Vedas.=\r\n There are no angels and Satans in Vedas. There is no Adam &amp; Eve eating=\r\n some fruit in Vedas. God does not send prophets in Vedas. God is not a hum=\r\nan like creature sitting on a throne in Vedas. There is no city called Heav=\r\nen or Hell in Vedic map of universe. There is no test that is being conduct=\r\ned on us. There is no destiny that has already been hardcoded for us.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;=\r\np&gt;On contrary,=A0&lt;strong&gt;Vedas extol to discover the truths through researc=\r\nh &amp; analysis. They urge us to change our destiny through thoughts and a=\r\nctions. They demand us to be rational and scientific.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;p&gt;And ye=\r\nt, Vedas do not say that one who believes in unscientific superstitions of =\r\nHeaven, Hell, Judgement Day, Angels, Satans, Adam, Eve, Miracles etc should=\r\n be ridiculed or punished in any manner. Instead they appeal for unity of a=\r\nll irrespective of personal or theological beliefs.=A0&lt;strong&gt;Intent matter=\r\ns, not beliefs.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0,0,0);font-family=\r\n:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px&quot;&gt;I admit this may be a personal reason tha=\r\nt you do not concur with because you could never get a chance to study Veda=\r\ns properly. But after my years of research in Vedas as well as all other ma=\r\njor texts of world, I am yet to find a book that surpasses Vedas in its com=\r\npleteness, scientific spirit and life-changing power. The foundation of Hin=\r\nduism is more solid, more strong, more reliable, more powerful than anythin=\r\ng else I know. And if I also add along with Vedas the other Hindu gems- Git=\r\na, Upanishads &amp; Darshans- then nothing comes at par for an evolved mind=\r\n.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=3D&quot;font-family:arial,sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:rgb(80,=\r\n0,80)&quot;&gt;So I have no option but to be proud to be Hindu. My pride lies in my=\r\n conduct of life as per virtues of patience, tolerance, self-control and sc=\r\nientific temper. My pride lies in loving entire humanity. My pride lies in =\r\ndefending against any form of injustice. My pride lies in promoting scienti=\r\nfic way of living to extent possible, and yet be loving of those who disagr=\r\nee with me. My pride lies in living up to the standards of an enlightened H=\r\nindu. My pride lies in my honest humility.&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p style=3D&quot;font-family:aria=\r\nl,sans-serif;font-size:13px;color:rgb(80,0,80)&quot;&gt;Yes, I am proud to be Hindu=\r\n.
