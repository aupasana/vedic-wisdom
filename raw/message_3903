Well, =\r\nNatural order of the universe is neither fair nor unfair. It is just an &quot;or=\r\nder&quot;. Your actions gets opposite reactions. You experience the fruits of yo=\r\nur actions, as determined by the order of nature. A person may happen to be=\r\n doing what he sees as his dharma and earthquake may strike there and kill =\r\nhim. If so, there must be a previous karma as a result of which he is place=\r\nd there at that time.\n&gt; \n&gt; In the case of the priest in the story, his mist=\r\nake is that he slapped a person worshipping god. If he had no way of assess=\r\ning the bhava (feeling) in the mind of the person doing the worship, he sho=\r\nuld&#39;ve given the benefit of doubt and assumed it was a sincere devotee, rat=\r\nher than assuming it was a fool.\n&gt; \n&gt; See, when Ramakrishna went there and =\r\nsaw Trilinga Swami, he immediately knew the stature and remarked that this =\r\nis Viswanatha himself. However, others may not be so fortunate. You only sa=\r\nw a body with some body parts and some clothes and nothing beyond it. If so=\r\n, give the benefit of doubt and treat kindly and respectfully. Just because=\r\n of external parameters, do not judge a person and act harsh.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hitting =\r\na person who still has a limited self-identification is one thing and hitti=\r\nng a person who has no limited self-identification and identifies with the =\r\nentire universe or with a deity is different.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; In any case, =\r\ndo not worry about that priest that much. For all you know, he may be an as=\r\nsociate of Shiva who came along with Trilinga Swami to enact a story and te=\r\nach a moral and he may have gone back to Shiva. Even if not, he was lucky t=\r\no enact an important role in an interesting divine drama.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; J=\r\neevanmuktas may engage in actions that are difficult to comprehend. They ha=\r\nve no personal ego, will and agenda. They become instruments for Nature to =\r\nfulfil the Natural order. The action of Trilinga Swami may help several peo=\r\nple question, challenge and overcome their biases and learn some important =\r\nlessons, centuries after he left earth.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Regarding many gods=\r\n: As I keep emphasizing, yogis and saints sometimes give advices based on d=\r\nesa-kaala-paatra or advices geared at a specific set of people.\n&gt; \n&gt; There =\r\nis nothing wrong in having many deities in pooja room and worshipping all. =\r\nSuch people may lead fruitful dharmik lives. However, Vimalananda may not b=\r\ne concerned about such people. His teachings may be addressed at some other=\r\n people to come in the coming years who he has rina with and who are meant =\r\nto achieve saayujya of some deities and do some work. There is an intended =\r\naudience for every work and no work can be perfect for all audience.\n&gt; \n&gt; I=\r\nf the goal is either liberation or a deity&#39;s darshan (vision) or saayujya (=\r\ncompany), one has to agree that focusing on one deity is the best thing to =\r\ndo, rather than trying to focus mind on ten deities and keep switching. A d=\r\neity comes when mind and its thoughts are filled with that deity&#39;s name and=\r\n mantra and other thoughts are driven away from the mind. Vimalananda perha=\r\nps wanted to motivate several people to strive for vision/company of deitie=\r\ns. He probably thought some people he has a rina with would come to earth w=\r\nith such a potential.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Thyagaraja did compose songs on many =\r\ndeities. But, he first had a darshan of Rama. He spent several years chanti=\r\nng Rama&#39;s name and had a darshan. Then he composed songs on many deities. H=\r\nowever, he saw all of them as different emanations from Rama. He saw Rama i=\r\nn all.\n&gt; \n&gt; Same with Aadi Shankara, Muththuswamy Deekshitar, Bammera Potha=\r\nna and others.\n&gt; \n&gt; When one achieves perfection in surrender to one deity,=\r\n one&#39;s life is made. After that, one will see the same deity in all deities=\r\n even if he worships 100 deities. If one is switching between ten deities b=\r\nefore that, it may not be helpful in filling the mind with thoughts of any =\r\nof those deities. Mind sees those deities as different objects and may not =\r\nfully surrender to any of them. Still, as I said, one may lead a fruitful d=\r\nhaarmik life. That&#39;s fine.\n&gt; \n&gt; But, if you really want to taste the nectar=\r\n of complete surrender, it is better to pick one deity and fill the mind wi=\r\nth his/her thoughts.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Excellent answers on each thread and=\r\n mother showed her divine\n&gt; &gt; grace through you that I am able to find answ=\r\ners to many\n&gt; &gt; questions that my immature mind keeps on asking! \n&gt; \n&gt; Thou=\r\ngh I had some spiritual experiences fortunately, I am not a realized person=\r\n.

I do understand that Telang Swamy might have been a gr=\r\neat yogi but my point is how are we to understand that greatness and in tha=\r\nt context what is ununsual in the priest&#39;s reaction that God had to punish =\r\nhim that hard! If priest was aware and still did that, then I can understan=\r\nd the consequence. I haven&#39;t yet the second book though! Probably that will=\r\n explain. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Also, I understand RamaKrishna Paramahamsa&#39; s famous &#39;D=\r\nig at one place 10 feet instead of 1 foot at 10 places if you want to find =\r\nwater&#39;. But contrary to that we find great saints / composers / poets from =\r\nIndia have indeed worshipped many forms of the God and were successful in t=\r\nhat approach as well. For instance, there is not a single deity form that w=\r\nas not worshipped by Adi Sankara and/or Muththuswamy Dikshitar. It was famo=\r\nus that Muththuswamy Dikshitar was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka and he l=\r\neft his mortal coil by singing to Madurai MeenakshiDevi in the presence of =\r\nmany of his disciples. But he composed songs of deep devotion that have imm=\r\nense power and depth on Lord Shiva, Ganesha, Subramanya, Rama and so on. So=\r\n was Thyagaraja. So were many great composers of Carnatic Music in that pat=\r\nh. In fact they were all great advaitis and never saw any difference betwee=\r\nn any form of the God, what soever. Bammera Pothana, a great poet of Andhra=\r\n who\n&gt; &gt; translated Bhagavatam, in his opening invocatory poems, pays homag=\r\ne to Lord Vishnu, Shiva, Brahma, Ganesha, Saraswati, Brahmi, Durga, Lakshmi=\r\n in that order before declaring that he got the divine inspiration from Lor=\r\nd Rama to write the Stories of Krishna! Where is the difference between any=\r\n form of God here! I wonder. So, I was not able to comprehend why Vimalanan=\r\nda accuses many Hindus of having a chaotic mind just because their puja man=\r\ndirams are filled with many photographs/ idols of different murthis of Almi=\r\nghty.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nagraj \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhagaru, \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Excellent an=\r\nswers on each thread and mother showed her divine grace through you that I =\r\nam able to find answers to many questions that my immature mind keeps on as=\r\nking! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Anyway, coming back to the topic, some of the topics I foun=\r\nd disturbing in the first book of Aghora are as follows: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 1. On th=\r\ne page 45 it says that Telang swami performed the ritual bath of Kashi Vish=\r\nveshwara with his own urine and feces. What could be the compelling reason =\r\nfor this bizarre behavior and why should the priest who slapped him die, be=\r\ncause in my opinion, anyone else would have done the same in the least! Sin=\r\nce you have an excellent way to explain many seemingly disturbing things, I=\r\n hope to find and answer here. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2. In quite a few places, Vimalana=\r\nnda equates changing the loyalty from diety to diety as akin to prostitutio=\r\nn, which I find as an extreme view! If that were true, why would Adi Sankar=\r\na compose so many hymns in praise of so many dieties, Thyagaraja composed i=\r\nn the praise of Sri Rama, Krishna, Shiva, Ganesha and Jaganmata as well. So=\r\n are so many great composers / poets. The examples of Tulasidas and Leelash=\r\nuka where they wanted to see their favorite deity form only (rama in the ca=\r\nse of former and krishna in the case of latter) despite knowing that the ot=\r\nher form is the same supreme being, are only a very minority in the list of=\r\n Bhaktas that we have? Why this kind of a view. I see myself being equally =\r\nin the love and awe of every form of god, namely Shiva, rama, krishna, gane=\r\nsha, amba, subramanya, anjaneya and so on! \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Nagraj \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- O=\r\nn Tue, 3/2/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Fr=\r\nom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@charter. net&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Surren=\r\nder (Re: Aghora books..)\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; Date: T=\r\nuesday, March 2, 2010, 6:31 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; How to achieve it effectivey?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If it can be achieved easi=\r\nly, we will not have so many spiritual paths and so many sadhanas.

Look at your belongings (spouse, children, job, house, cars, wealth=\r\n, name, fame, and even body) as the property of god. Imagine that you are a=\r\n temporary caretaker, just as a servant may be living in a rich person&#39;s ho=\r\nuse as the caretaker as that person stays away. Think of all that is in you=\r\nr hands as the sacred property of your master and take care like a committe=\r\nd servant. A servant takes the best care of his master&#39;s property, but does=\r\n not get attached. Do not be attached anything and yet take the best possib=\r\nle care. If something goes wrong, do not worry too much and tell yourself t=\r\nhat the master will take care of it when he gets a chance to look at it. Th=\r\nink for a moment how a servant taking care of the properties of a master li=\r\nving away thinks and behaves.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If one can attain the spirit and men=\r\ntal state of the servant in this analogy, one&#39;s life will be made.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Read what Manish wrote below:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;Once you take Ti=\r\nme out of the equation (because a deity has a different time space frame wh=\r\nich runs in thousands of years which pass by in a blink of an eye) by waiti=\r\nng with patience, then where will God go? God has to come, He can&#39;t escape.=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Take time out of the equation, i.e. do not put a time limit o=\r\nr say &quot;I have done this sadhana for XYZ years.

Only very advanced sadhak=\r\nas will be able to identify\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; rnas / karmic debts and know how/wher=\r\ne/why they are to be paid off. The rest\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of us have to follow dhar=\r\nma, which includes standing up for what is right\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and righteous an=\r\nd not being defeatist or fatalistic. Otherwise, Arjuna could\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; have=\r\n written off the wrongs of the Kauravas as a massive rnu, but of course,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna urged him to take up the dharma of kshatriyahood and slay w=\r\nithout\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mercy. The webs of karma are too intricate and complex and=\r\n delicate to be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; comprehended unless one has reached certain very =\r\nvery high levels of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual attainment, and even then, it will =\r\nonly be a partial vision. Only\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; S/He who is unlimited (Iswara/i) k=\r\nnows and sees the entire web of karma and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; knows best how to dispa=\r\ntch rnus as necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Aditiji and oth=\r\ners,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun could do what he did for a reason.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Arjun was a great sadhaka himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; What he did was sort of simp=\r\nle. He did so much sadhana of a deity that this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deity began to oc=\r\ncupy him day and night. This deity was a form of Shiva.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That in t=\r\nurn gave him the rarest of rare opportunity to be with Krishna at\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n the time of the battle, because Shiva is the greatest Vaishnava, the only\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one who knows how to worship Krishna properly. Only by becoming S=\r\nhiva\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yourself can you worship Krishna perfectly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Now, at the time of the battle, Arjun was beset with doubt, but when h=\r\ne saw\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the Viswharoopa something crazy happened as if Krishna was =\r\nwithin him. Of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; course Krishna was present even before, but Arjun =\r\ncould not perceive Him\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; properly. this was Krishna&#39;s lila or play =\r\nof course, because otherwise would\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun have treated him as a fr=\r\niend ever??!!(slapping Him on the back,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; playing tricks on Him, bu=\r\nt the Lord loves to play with His genuine devotees)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ok=\r\n, now once Arjun&#39;s remnant personality was further effaced and replaced by\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Krishna in his form as Kaala Viswharoopa, then it was effectively=\r\n Krishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; who destroyed the Kauravas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is why at the=\r\n end of the battle when all the Pandavas went to ask the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person w=\r\nho had been decapitated by Krishna&#39;s Sudarshana but who was still\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n kept alive at the top of the tree,..... about who was responsible for the\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Pandava&#39;s victory..... ....\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; All that man said was that =\r\nat the beginning of the day he could see the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sudarshana start out=\r\n from one end of the battlefield, then having done all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that destr=\r\nuction, it would return to krishna&#39;s hand at the end of the day.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nAnd the blood which was being spilt was drunk by Krishna Shakti or Kali.\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Arjun was lucky, He had God incarnate at His side, other=\r\ns may not be quite\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; so fortunate. For example, Ramakrishna used to=\r\n say that a doctor&#39;s money was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; blood and pus (I left my thriving =\r\nsurgical career when I read this a few\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; years ago).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He s=\r\naid something similar about the money earned by a lawyer.(I think he was\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; referring to criminal law in that time).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Easie=\r\nst thing to do is Ishwar(Ishwari) pranidhana. Surrender to God. I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n freely admitted to the Lord when I had His darshana that I was a complete\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; fool and knew nothing at all. She taught me all I know because of=\r\n this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Whatever you ever do in life, just try and be straight in =\r\nevery dealing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that you have with anybody, give whatever you can, =\r\nturn away nobody from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your door, who knows when God will come to =\r\ntest you?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This does not mean that one is fatalistic an=\r\nd does nothing, but it means\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that terrific sadhana is useful, nay=\r\n even necessary.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sadhana and a real Guru (Gu kara&#39;s ch=\r\na andhakas cha-removes darkness Ru kas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; cha Teja Uchayte- brings l=\r\night into the being), are essential. Before I met\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; my real Guru, I=\r\n saw plenty of guys who were basically sadhakas themselves, I\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; use=\r\nd to ask and swear at them, &quot;You are blind yourself, how will you lead\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; the blind me to God, when you have not seen God yourself face to face=\r\n?!!! &quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Once you take Time out of the equation (because=\r\n a deity has a different time\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; space frame which runs in thousands=\r\n of years which pass by in a blink of an\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eye) by waiting with pat=\r\nience, then where will God go?

It is dependent on what natu=\r\nre expects from you,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which in turn is based on who you have b=\r\neen in the past, what actions you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did in the past while ident=\r\nifying with the action, who you affected in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; p=\r\nast (and how) with the actions that you identified with, what debts you\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created in the process, and what mental tendencies you accumulat=\r\ned until\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If, based on one&#39;s =\r\nmental tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; person\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma.

The time then was such that there was too much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; weight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of s=\r\nome weight.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Tremendous\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to take pl=\r\nace and civilization destroyed to a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; extent,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Arjuna being a great\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; warrior,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. Some peop=\r\nle he deeply loved and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respected were on the other side and i=\r\nt was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the same Ar=\r\njuna was born again in the 19th century as one of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna=\r\n Paramahamsa&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n previous life, according to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; this\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new time and place. He was born to renounce mat=\r\nerial life despite his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aristocratic upbringing and live the s=\r\nimple life of a monk and inspire\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; generations to embrace a sim=\r\nple life of mental detachment and service to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; others. When he =\r\nis born again (which he has to, as per what Ramakrishna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; said)=\r\n, his dharma based on the time and place may be something else.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The tricky question is: =\r\nHow does one decide what is one&#39;s dharma?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Some =\r\npeople have interpreted Krishna&#39;s words saying &quot;follow your own\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and not someone else&#39;s dharma&quot; in the light of castis=\r\nm. Though the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of caste (varna) has been t=\r\nhere in Hinduism for a long time, the concept\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\ncaste mobility was very much there. Valmiki was a shudra who lived by\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. He became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwami=\r\ntra was\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kshatrita and a powerful king. He becam=\r\ne a brahmana and and a maharshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; later. Basically varna shows =\r\none&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; varna\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of =\r\nfather, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As one\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one does.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words w=\r\nhich tells you to know\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your cast=\r\ne is wrong. Moreover, there are not just 4 dharmas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; the world. Each person has individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very difficult. If one is pur=\r\ne\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In fact, all of us ha=\r\nve a part of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind that tells us what our dhar=\r\nma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noise from other part=\r\ns of our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment combining di=\r\nscrimination and intuition\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is our=\r\n dharma and follow it sincerely. We may be err, but\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; doing\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to engage in\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that we a=\r\nre not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load.=\r\n We should not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; build\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too much attachment to what =\r\nwe are doing. We should engage in the best\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible actions (=\r\nbased on our best judgment on what our dharma in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; given\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with as little attachment and self-identification =\r\nwith the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. When the action is finished, we =\r\nshould leave the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; result\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We should not thi=\r\nnk &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; etc. Su=\r\nch adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; untac=\r\nhed action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nslowly.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and te=\r\nll our dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; clearer.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a positive feedba=\r\nck here. This will slowly enable us to see our\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly=\r\n and follow it without incurring new karmas. This is not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; easy,\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s se=\r\nnse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time=\r\n if one engages in action with\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In deciding one&#39;s dharma=\r\n, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another exter=\r\nnal input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; can\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one=\r\n&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiri=\r\ntual master, one can take the words\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the master=\r\n to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it sincerely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was and thought killing=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; gurus\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a gur=\r\nu in Krishna who clarified his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swa=\r\nmi Vivekananda) was confused about his\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and=\r\n wanted to renounce the world and go to a secluded place to do\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nsadhana,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa cried and prevailed upon him=\r\n to stay in the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; material\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; world and do the work of=\r\n Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who is not in tune with na=\r\nture and does not know who one is, what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; deb=\r\nts are and what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; what\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul w=\r\nith a clear insight\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; into\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a=\r\n guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bottomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set =\r\nof principles and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma chan=\r\nges from person to person,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; from\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to time and =\r\nfrom place to place. Also, there are no thumbrules to\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; find\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s understanding=\r\n of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma by increasing internal purity. B=\r\ny doing various kinds of spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana (like homam, japam=\r\n etc) and engaging in actions without much\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attachment, one ca=\r\nn slowly purify oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s individual dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -------\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Sense of Distinction and of good and evil is bound =\r\nto persist so long as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one does not realize God&quot; - Ramakrishna P=\r\naramahamsa\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; On Fri, Feb 26, 2010 at 8:10 AM, Adi=\r\nti Banerjee &lt;banerjeea@gmail. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;I agree with Dinesh.

Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the na=\r\nmes\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C3=83? Aghora (aghori) does=\r\n not see anything as\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; terrible or bad or impure and sees all as =\r\nimpermanent manifestations of god\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and tries to focus the thinki=\r\nng of the mind on what is permanent (god)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; always, instead of im=\r\npermanent manifestations of god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone dies, north Indians =\r\nchant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; carrying the dead body to th=\r\ne funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; is true and eve=\r\nrything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tha=\r\nt life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ulti=\r\nmate truth\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; only when someone dies? When someone praises us for =\r\na supposedly great thing\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; we have done and we are about to feel =\r\nproud and happy, can&#39;t we tell\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai.=\r\n This thing we did and the praises are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Onl=\r\ny the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusio=\r\nns&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to =\r\nget it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; seems beautiful and other things that seem not so beautiful are tem=\r\nporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell=\r\n on temporary\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions&quot;?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; When someone attacks and abuses us and we are about to=\r\n feel sad or\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya h=\r\nai. These abuses are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real=\r\n. Let the mind not dwell on\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; A t=\r\nrue Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. His mind\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* o=\r\nn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc=\r\n and thinking\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; about them with attraction/aversion ) and tries t=\r\no find and focus on what is\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent. But he takes it to extre=\r\nmes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *=C3=\r\n=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perce=\r\nive is an illusion&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An aghora pursues it practically. If feces=\r\n and fruit are both impermenant\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; illusions and the only permanen=\r\nt reality within them is the Self, he\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; questions why he can eat =\r\nfruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; feces is eate=\r\nn.=C3=83? But, please remember that eating feces is not the main\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; impermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the mai=\r\nn point. For\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; example, eating feces with disgust serves no purpo=\r\nse, for such a person&#39;s\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind is dwelling on the impermenant man=\r\nifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating it. A successful Agho=\r\nra may be eating feces, but the mind will not be\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dwelling on th=\r\ne fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; wi=\r\nll not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; he is eating Self.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Of course, a vedantin also has the sa=\r\nme notions really. He chants\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; vedic verses when eating food, whi=\r\nch essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; consuming Self&quot;. Nevert=\r\nheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be fully a=\r\nbsorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brin=\r\njal\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the fo=\r\ncus on the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permanent (Self).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; Thus, a vedantin and an a=\r\nghora are telling themselves the same\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; truth and trying to absor=\r\nb that truth into every thought and impulse. But\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; aghora is putt=\r\ning himself in an extreme situation where failure results in a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nvery bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a =\r\nVedic verse\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and e=\r\nats tasty laddus and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; nicely made food, the fallout from failing=\r\n to absorb the mind in Self while\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; eating is not too bad. If the=\r\n mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice)\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; taste of a laddu=\r\n or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the=\r\n mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very ba=\r\nd dual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; everyone merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Agh=\r\nora sadhanas\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; succeeds.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=83?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; &gt; *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83=\r\n? =C3=83? *=C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? =C3=83? *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n(Message over 64 KB, truncated)"}}
