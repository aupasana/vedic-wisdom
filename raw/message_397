Lagna would be \npowerful with 1st, 9th (dharma and bhagya) and 10th (karma) lords and also \nthe 8th lord (tapascharya).\n\nJupiter in lagna is great for sadhana. Thus, Sagittarius lagna is great. \nThat may not work out for several people, as it is in the early afternoon.\n\nAlso, Pisces lagna would be good. Lagna lord Jupiter in 10th, Sun and Saturn \nin 6th and Rahu in 11th would be well-placed. Aries lagna would have a \npowerful 6th house of siddhi and 9th house of dharma and bhagya.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;Swadhin&quot; &lt;beherajapan@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Tuesday, September 02, 2008 2:05 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Muhurta for Ganapati homam on the coming Ganesh \nChaturthi\n\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha ji\n&gt;\n&gt; Many of us will take the opportunity to do the Ganapati homam on the\n&gt; coming vinayaka chathurthi. Do you have any additional advice to\n&gt; follow on this occasion? Particularly, we need your advice for an\n&gt; auspicious moment to start the homam. Since many of us are living in\n&gt; different time zone some hints of combination of planetary positions\n&gt; will be helpful.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Swadhin\n&gt; P.S. The following day will be Risi panchami for people to do a guru puja.\n\n\n"}}
