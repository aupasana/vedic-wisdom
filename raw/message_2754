Here is the reason.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    In my first m=\r\nail (#2704) itself it is explicitly written, that Patanjali has used the ex=\r\nact word &quot;asmita&quot; for Egoism - which is the I-ness (Ahamkara) in Physical b=\r\nody consciousness - that causes identification of the seer with the instrum=\r\nent of seeing i.e. Physical senses.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyorekatmataivasmita -6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is the identificatio=\r\nn of the seer with the instrument of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; seeing.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt; Patanjali =\r\nhas used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   PATANJALI has not used=\r\n the word AHAMKARA anywhere in his PRECISE AND ESTEEMED sanskrit dissertati=\r\non on YOGA - he has chosen to use the word ASMITA everywhere. E.g.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n 1.  vitarka vicharanandasmita rupanugamat samprajnatah -\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;         =\r\n         SASMITA SAMADHI\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 2.

In any case, what is called as Ahamkara =\r\nin 24 principles of Sankhya is actually Asmita, which can be very-loosely p=\r\nitted as Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   The idea stated by me was on firm grounds - w=\r\nith reference to Patanjali Sutras and the words of Sri Yukteswar in Autobio=\r\ngraphy of a Yogi. And this idea is there in my first mail, though not the e=\r\nxact table: \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   PHYSICAL I-NESS (AHAMKARA)  =3D ASMITA   =3D Physic=\r\nal Egotism\n&gt; &gt;   ASTRAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  =3D MANAS    =3D Astral attach=\r\nments\n&gt; &gt;   CAUSAL I-NESS   (AHAMKARA)  =3D CHITTA   =3D Causal Perceptions=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Also, one of the 2 reasons that I had given on why Astral/Causa=\r\nl Body beings don&#39;t have sense of Asmita as a dominant sense of I-ness is t=\r\nhis:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like e=\r\nyes to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; see, hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yogi)... the sense of egoism does not take roots in the astral-body &gt;=\r\n and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Similarly, Causal bodied bein=\r\ngs can use thought to sense everything.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be=\r\n rooted out while the consciousness is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; associated with the Physical =\r\nBody sensory activities or has \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;   Lastly, ex=\r\ntending upon this idea further, there are beings in the Astral cosmos who h=\r\nave never been in Physical forms - We Physical beings are not the only ones=\r\n in the cycles of creation. While they will still have the idea of &quot;Asmita&quot;=\r\n in their causal bodies, but they will always be repelled by the grosser-vi=\r\nbrations of Sensual experiences in Physical Bodies/Cosmos, and hence would =\r\nnot incur any Physical Karma due to &quot;Asmita&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; [ TO ALL IN THE LIST ]  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt;   - If the above explanation resolves the issue, well and good.

I-ness derived from Ahamkara,Ma=\r\nnas and Chitta has no innate power to Control any other idea of the 35 Caus=\r\nal-ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reason:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Soul is the only Truth and controller=\r\n, everything else has an unreal and derived existence. Thus, all the 35 ide=\r\nas co-ordinate with each other, and not control each other. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. A new-born child or a person in Hypnotic-Trance, is able to use h=\r\nis sense-consciousness coherently due to the astral-bodys&#39; sense of I-ness =\r\nderived from Manas, that coordinates the senses.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; He has no Buddhi=\r\n or discriminating faculty to interact with manas (sensory-motor mind) and =\r\ntell it what to do - as you have proposed. Thus, Manas co-ordinates the sen=\r\nses due to its own sense of I-ness, not due to Buddhi.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I hope this clarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;=\r\npvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out =\r\nof the 19 or 35 attributes of individualized consciousness, which one gives=\r\n the idea &quot;I am this&quot; or &quot;I am that&quot;? Of course, it is ahamkaraka or I-ness=\r\n or egosense or ego principle!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is one&#39;s idea of &quot;I=\r\n am this&quot; limited to a physical body? Of course not! If someone says &quot;so an=\r\nd so person is a terrible person&quot;, one may feel offended or if someone says=\r\n &quot;so and so person is a great person&quot;, one may feel elated. One&#39;s ahamkara =\r\nor I-ness is identifying with the criticism or praise, even though nothing =\r\nis being done to the physical body and only a name is being used. When some=\r\nbody calls one by name from distance (as opposed to patting on the physical=\r\n body and calling), one&#39;s consciousness may still think &quot;I am being called&quot;=\r\n and one may turn towards the caller. As in these examples, one&#39;s I-ness do=\r\nes of course bind itself to more than a body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Supp=\r\nose one gets a dream while sleeping. One may have forgotten totally about t=\r\nhe physical body in the dream! One may think of something else as &quot;I&quot;. In d=\r\nreams, one may see oneself as a different body or may not even &quot;see&quot; onself=\r\n, but still one may have the sense that so and so thing is happening to &quot;me=\r\n&quot;. So, even when the mind is drawn away from the physical body, there is st=\r\nill a notion of &quot;I am this&quot; (I-ness) in a dream. That is ahamkara or I-ness=\r\n or ego principle.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your idea that ahamkara is limi=\r\nted to physical body is absolutely unacceptable. Ahamkara or I-ness extends=\r\n beyond the physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Also, your idea that de=\r\nities like Agni do not have ahamkara (I-ness) because they do not have phys=\r\nical bodies is incorrect. Of course, Agni does have an I-ness and thinks &quot;I=\r\n am Agni and this is what I do&quot;. If he did not have that I-ness, he would n=\r\not do everything he does.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Moreover, the 19 or 35 i=\r\ndeas of individualized consciousness do interact with each other, whether w=\r\ne use the word &quot;control&quot; for some of those interactions or not. For example=\r\n, buddhi (intellectual/ discriminating mind) judges various past experience=\r\ns, interacts with manas (sensory-motor mind) and tells it what to do. Then =\r\nmanas interacts with karmendriyas (organs of action) and makes them do vari=\r\nous things. My buddhi determined what to write and my manas told my hands t=\r\no type this and I ended up typing.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your point abou=\r\nt &quot;what exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot; is totally out of place. The =\r\nsense of I-ness, the memories and conditioning, the logical mind, the senso=\r\nry-motor mind, karmendriyas etc are all different parts of individualized c=\r\nonsciousness and they play different roles while interacting with each othe=\r\nr in different ways. Some of those interactions may be deemed to be control=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Am not mixing up the terminologies, though my=\r\n mail didn&#39;t\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; go in details.

Your understanding is flawed.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; 1. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the i=\r\ndeational or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the physica=\r\nl body (See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a phys=\r\nical/astral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara like we do.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi als=\r\no. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ...they are all guided by the sense=\r\n of I-ness. That sense of I-ness \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; permeates through all lay=\r\ners of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2. =\r\nWhere did you read this up ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a fine l=\r\nine between the sense of I-ness attributed to the Individual Soul and the s=\r\nense of I-ness derived through the idea of Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is f=\r\nreed of the three bodies, the individuality of the Soul Atom is not destroy=\r\ned (Resurrection implies that), while it has already given up the idea of A=\r\nhamkara including all other ideas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Individuali=\r\nty of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara because &quot;Wha=\r\nt exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of Ahamkara, being =\r\none of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account for neither control=\r\ns the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, without re=\r\nquiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would always in=\r\nterfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions of life=\r\n-forces and so on.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Essentially, the 35 ideas o=\r\nf causal body are the basic causal forces and are not related as cause-effe=\r\nct to each other. Thus, each is independent of the application of the sense=\r\n of I-ness derived from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-=\r\nideas, their functioning as well as existence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;deri=\r\nved&quot; in any way by the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those=\r\n with sharpest Buddhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, be=\r\ncause they didn&#39;t work upon that particular idea.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the ent=\r\nire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; individualized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; 3. Well, as most Physical-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/=\r\ncausal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t apply in the same way to the finer Astral and C=\r\nausal-bodied beings who can always pierce the veil of Maya and see the huma=\r\nn activities. Thus, what is &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individualized c=\r\nonsciousness for a physical-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as=\r\n for an astral/causal bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; An Astral-bodied being th=\r\ninks of Manas/sense- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individu=\r\nalized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A Causal-bodied being thinks of Chitta/=\r\nperceptive- consciousness as the very basis of the entire individualized co=\r\nnsciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, that individuality is of the Soul not d=\r\nerived from any idea, which is why it is not lost when the Astral being los=\r\nes astral consciousness and reincarnates in the Physical body.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As an example, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are able =\r\nto work through all the beings in all their physical-bodies simultaneously =\r\n(like Ganesh resides in the Mooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..)=\r\n, never getting controlled by Ahamkara that would require them to say that =\r\nthis particular body is &quot;my body&quot; or that one is mine - unless they incarna=\r\nte in Physical bodies themselves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal- bodi=\r\ned beings, so they would attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession)=\r\n of the sense-bound worshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to =\r\npossess ones&#39; physical body as well as act out their Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Out of the four antahkaranas, chitta (rem=\r\nembering or conditioned \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness=\r\n) are parts of the kaarana \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sareera (causal body) and remai=\r\nn till the end.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4. As per the resurrected Soul=\r\n of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a Yogi -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas comprising Astr=\r\nal body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge, 5 funct=\r\nions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising Physical=\r\n body (16 chemical elements).\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Now, as we all k=\r\nnow that Physical body expires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 el=\r\nements comprising it go away at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also c=\r\nast off as a whole in the corresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of d=\r\nifferent constituent ideas slipping out of it at different times. Chitta be=\r\ning the staging idea for all other modifications, can be termed as the last=\r\n to go, when the causal body is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising a=\r\nbove Chitta.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the idea of Ahamkara is bou=\r\nnd with Gross Physical vibrations, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Manas with Subtle Astral =\r\nvibrations and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Chitta with infinitely Subtle Causal Vibratio=\r\nns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Buddhi being another variable, can be deve=\r\nloped or undeveloped irrespective of the other 34. Even illiterate Moodha, =\r\nthrough surrender to their Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkara and so on...\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; BTW, Chitta is not the Conditioned Mind. Chitt=\r\na does store the residual impressions of all the past incarnations. However=\r\n, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;t have any inherent ability to =\r\nact upon (Rajas) those impressions, just like a container containing an inf=\r\nlammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn it down. Sadhana is required for=\r\n That.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The Samskaras stored by Chitta, including those of Nid=\r\nra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to the Tamo Guna, while=\r\n the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - Tamas&quot; represents th=\r\ne SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-perceiving Satvic Chi=\r\ntta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras it stores.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all residual impressions, only =\r\nSatva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul reflects on=\r\n itself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus realizing it=\r\ns own nature as Brahman.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 5. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In =\r\nPatanjali Yoga Sutras: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; drigadarshanaktyore katmataivasmita -=\r\n6\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Egoism is the identification of the seer with the instrumen=\r\nt of seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; S=\r\nince astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see, hear,=\r\n smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense of ego=\r\nism does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create Astral =\r\nKarma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense everything.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the=\r\n consciousness is associated with the Physical Body sensory activities or h=\r\nas Physical Karma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 6. The idea of Manas, as th=\r\ne controller of sense-consciousness , must be overcome in Astral body, thro=\r\nugh Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chapter 43) where Sri Yukteswar=\r\n illustrates that only those beings who cannot be tempted to go back to the=\r\n pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted to stay permanently in the=\r\n Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sense-consciousness which is as=\r\nsociated with Manas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In Patanjali Yoga Sutras =\r\nalso it is mentioned in the same manner :\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dris=\r\ntanushravika vishaya vitrishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; That effect which comes to these who have given up their=\r\n thirst after objects, either seen or heard, and which wills to control the=\r\n objects, is non-attachment. Vivekananda has commented that Vairagya is the=\r\n only way to freedom.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplish=\r\ned by transferring the consciousness to Astral-Body and working out the Ast=\r\nral Karma or otherwise as an astral-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; 7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; yogashchittavrittin irodhah -2-=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, extinguishing all the movements of Chitta is called &quot;Y=\r\noga&quot;. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is to be accomplished by transferr=\r\ning the consciousness to Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or ot=\r\nherwise as a causal-bodied being.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I hope this =\r\nclarifies.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Narasimha PV=\r\nR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste Nitish,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am afraid you are mixing up terminologies. For =\r\nexample, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limited to the physical =\r\nbody, but extends to subtle body and causal body as well.

Out of the four antahkaran=\r\nas, chitta (remembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) =\r\nare parts of the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ahamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also.=\r\n When manas (sensory-motor mind) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (intelle=\r\nctual or thinking mind) analyzes current and past observations of mind or c=\r\nhitta (remembering or conditioned mind) stores various observations or retr=\r\nieves previously stored observations, they are all guided by the sense of I=\r\n-ness. That sense of I-ness permeates through all layers of one&#39;s individua=\r\nlized consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Upanishads and variou=\r\ns scriptures have broken down the individualized consciousness into various=\r\n groups by functionality, like five koshas, three sareeras, five praanas, f=\r\nive jnaanendriyas, five karmendriyas, four antahkaranas, six/seven chakras =\r\netc. But ego/ahamkaara/ I-ness is the very basis of the entire individualiz=\r\ned consciousness.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Though the word jnaana m=\r\neans different things to different people, a jnaana yogi pursues Self by th=\r\ne path of contemplation and discrimination. When a jnaana yogi reaches the =\r\nfinal target, all bodies and koshas are merged in cosmos.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---=\r\n--------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarp=\r\nana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wi=\r\nsdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.co=\r\nmcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http:/=\r\n/www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- yeeahoo_=\r\n99 &lt;nitish.arya@ &gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT ||\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In my opinion, there are three disti=\r\nnct phases that lead the sould to rise above Ego, Mind and Chitta - corresp=\r\nonding to the three bodies physical (Sthoola), astral (Sookshma) and causal=\r\n (Karana) resp.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising above Ego is Jn=\r\nana - Merging Physical body in Physical cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Rising abo=\r\nve Mind is Vairagya - Merging Astral body in Astral cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Rising above Chitta is Yoga - Merging Causal body in Causal cosmos\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Finally, becoming established in Para-Brahma=\r\nn is YogaArudha.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Your comments.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

One pursuing that path may or =\r\nmay not debate with others and may or may not read many scriptures, but one=\r\n will analyze and debate within oneself. One starts with the basic axioms (=\r\ne.g. Self is imperishable and without a beginning or an end). One will go o=\r\nn eliminating things that one is aware of as not being Self. For example, b=\r\nody has a beginning and end and is perishable. So it is not Self. One intro=\r\nspects like this and, though the process of elimination, finally finds the =\r\ntrue Self. That is gyaana yoga. Pure gyaana yoga is very difficult to follo=\r\nw in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Vichaara (contempla=\r\ntion) is the process of sadhana for an adherer of pure gyaana yoga.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, the gyaana (knowledge of Self) a=\r\nchieved by such a person at the end is not really different from the knowle=\r\ndge of Self achieved by a person following another path.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;       Try the new Yahoo!=\r\n India Homepage.
