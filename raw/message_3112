The uniqu=\r\neness of Gospel is that its almost a day to Diary.\n\nNo book i&#39;ve read gives=\r\n me the same feeling as Gospel. why? because, It instatntly takes you to Da=\r\nkshineshwar and makes you sit in the sabha of the unbelievable Man. I feel =\r\nIndebted to M for this work.\nIn my opinion &#39;The Gospel of Sri Ramakrishna&quot; =\r\nis the most Authentic Autobiographical kind of account in the World.\n\n***\nA=\r\n person walking in Dhoti in Bangoli stayle and sometimes strolloing without=\r\n even that cloth, Asking Bangles and other jewellery to immitate Gopi, Jump=\r\n like a monkey to imbibe Hanumaan in his very being, cleaning ground with t=\r\nhe beard can easily make us belive that he is a Mad Man, a Phsyco, a crazy =\r\nMan and then again he starts teaching which overpowers super brain of Vivek=\r\nananda. starts instructing the Scholars like VidyaSagar, Mahendranath Gupta=\r\n. He removes the pride of Gauri without even debating. Then again he cries =\r\nlike child and asks everybody as to what will happen to his twisted arm. if=\r\n he will be cured or not, then again he dances like a storm in the kirtan a=\r\nt Balaram&#39;s house, Then he cries when he doesnot see Naren even for few day=\r\ns, he simply walks out of his room when asked by Authority of Temple and co=\r\nmes back in the same manner without any noise when requested to come back, =\r\nTears rolls from the eyes of He and Naren when later one is about to ask th=\r\ne permission for sanyaas, to whom even prositiutes salutes and curse Matur =\r\nfor planning to corrupt such a man, the man who explains deepest mystic tru=\r\nths in such a simple manner (for e.g. Brahma and Shakti are not different. =\r\nthey are like Milk and its whiteness, like Fire and its burning power, like=\r\n snake and its wringling motion), the man who looks with child&#39;s enthusiasm=\r\n and wonder, the crowd, the carriages etc.. on the street of calcutta, and =\r\nagain in the Samaadhi, frequently, unaware of the world and objectification=\r\ns...\n\nThe Son of Kali, The man with uncountable moods and yet the most simp=\r\nle.\n\nThe Kumbha Lagna with Sun, Moon and Mercury. All the 3 most important =\r\nLagna coinciding in the Philosophical Kumbha and who can be more focussed t=\r\nhen such a person? and again complimented immensly with exalted Mars and ex=\r\nalted Venus from both the sides. and Jupiter and Saturn from the Trines.He =\r\nis also the delight of Astrologers.\n\nWarm Regards,\n\nUtpal\n\n\n--- In vedic-wi=\r\nsdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n Nice mail!\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ramakrishna is absolutely unique. Though many other maste=\r\nrs came to earth in the last few centuries, who perfected some types of spi=\r\nritual moods or the other, he is someone who perfected everything. He would=\r\n chant Hari&#39;s name, melt with emotion and go into bhaava samaadhi for hours=\r\n together. He would engage in 64 kriyas of tantra, without his mind being p=\r\nerturbed by anything. He would be in samadhi where he is at the feet of god=\r\n. He would be in samadhi where he is in oneness with god. He would be in ni=\r\nrvikalpa samadhi where there are no gods, no demons, no beings or objects, =\r\nbut just Aatman or Brahman.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The same person who would behave like a s=\r\nmall child at times would also show unmatched wisdom all the time. He would=\r\n transform an illiterate servant boy (Latu) into a great spiritual master (=\r\nSwami Adbhutananda) who was established in Shiva-consciousness at all times=\r\n. He would transform an energetic, skeptical, irreverant, independent, rati=\r\nonal and highly intelligent young man with several biases (Naren) into a ve=\r\nnerable and compassionate saint known as a great teacher around the world (=\r\nSwami Vivekananda).\n&gt;  \n&gt; He practiced karma yoga and his sishyas and the m=\r\nutt established by them engaged in so much social service across India. He =\r\npracticed jnaana yoga and his sishyas popularized Adwaita across the world.=\r\n He even engaged in raja yoga and taught a select few like Vivekananda. He =\r\nof course practiced bhakti yoga and melted in devotion when thinking of Kaa=\r\nli in the same way as he did when thought of Krishna. He even did Christian=\r\n and Islamic sadhanas.\n&gt;  \n&gt; He not only experienced the Absolute himself, =\r\nbut was capable of making others experience. His mere touch took Vivekanand=\r\na into samadhi in their second meeting. Vivekananda experienced other highe=\r\nr states later due to Ramakrishna&#39;s will (e.g. what happened for a few days=\r\n after he mocked the Vedantic statement that all is god, in front of Ramakr=\r\nishna). Even his guru Totapuri who was an adept in Adwaita and experienced =\r\nnirvikalpa samadhi several times was, for the first time in his life, intro=\r\nduced to the power of the Mother by Ramakrishna. Totapuri considered faith =\r\nin saguna forms of god as childish and believed only in the formless Brahma=\r\nn. But he left Dakshineshwar with a healthy respect for the Saguna forms. H=\r\ne actually went inside the temple and prostrated before the idol before he =\r\nleft Dakshineshwar! And, there is the kalpataru day, when people started ex=\r\nperiencing different levels of spiritual bliss just by touching him. Everyo=\r\nne who touched him that day went into a spiritual ecstasy and stayed in it =\r\nfrozen right there in the garden. Some even went into different levels of s=\r\namadhi.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If this is how the Leela of an incarnation is, imagine how th=\r\ne leela of a poorna purusha like Lord Krishna must have been!\n&gt;  \n&gt; I perso=\r\nnally love analogies, allegories, metaphors and parables. Ramakrishna was a=\r\nn absolute master of those. He demystified things and taught the highest Tr=\r\nuths in simple terms so that everybody can understand the essence.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Ra=\r\nmakrishna is an absolutely unique saint who showed that all paths lead to g=\r\nod, not by stating theory, but by demonstrating it practically.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Unlik=\r\ne saints like Buddha, Aadi Shankara, Moses and Jesus, he is relatively rece=\r\nnt and his life is well-documented.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;  \n&gt; The fie=\r\nld of duality is like a dream. Being established in Brahman or Aatman is li=\r\nke the wakeful state. All the objects of dream disappear when one is awake.=\r\n They are unreal. However, they are quite real for one who is still in the =\r\ndream! And, a roaring lion from a dream and a meowing cat from a dream are =\r\nso different in their nature, abilities and effect. Even though a jnaani ma=\r\ny tell you there is god (Brahman) in everything and all are equal, it is tr=\r\nue only for one established in Brahman. If one is awake, a roaring lion fro=\r\nm a dream and a meowing cat from a dream are equal. But, to somebody still =\r\nsleeping, both are so different.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though all beings are but god, diffe=\r\nrent beings play different roles in the field of Maayaa and there is a clea=\r\nr hierarchy.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----------------------------=\r\n--------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://=\r\nwww.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Spirituality writings: http://groups.yahoo.=\r\ncom/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicA=\r\nstrologer.org\n&gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWrit=\r\nings\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Do =\r\nPitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; ---------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- rajars=\r\nhi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I have not read=\r\n the Kathamrita - so I cannot comment on it really but I found Sri Ramakris=\r\nhna Lilaprasanga by Swami Saradananda to be an excellent book, exhaustive a=\r\nnd detailed in the analysis. Swami Saradananda takes so my pains to beautif=\r\nully explain various aspects of Ramakrishna&#39;s spiritual behaviour and gener=\r\nal explanations of spiritual things as well. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; For example it is f=\r\nrom this book that I first understood why an Avatar like Ramakrishna had to=\r\n perform such severe sadhana. Also thiis book gives a detailed recording of=\r\n Ramakrishna&#39;s Tantric sadhanas, how he completed all the 64 kriyas.\n&gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; There is one point I have observed with Ramakrishna&#39;s teachings.His adv=\r\nises are often specific to the person he was advising. For someone he may s=\r\nay study the Adhyatma Ramayana, for another he advised never to touch the A=\r\ndhyatma Ramayana! Like a perfect teacher he advised the specific medicine f=\r\nor the specific problem in the path of spirituality that the specific perso=\r\nn was facing.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Second is his  fantastic razor sharp intellect. No =\r\none gives better examples to explain some aspect of spirituality than Ramak=\r\nrishna. Simple yet perfect. He uses the intellect to explain yet does not g=\r\net caught up in the mazes of words. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Third and most important, th=\r\ne range of spiritual moods he expressed was staggering. With all due to res=\r\npect to every great master who has walked on this planet, I can&#39;t recall an=\r\nother name who has expressed/manifested such diverse spiritual moods. His s=\r\npiritual journey is not like a bicycle race but rather a seven course meal =\r\nwhere he relishes every dish to the core.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Juding purely from an i=\r\nntellectual perspective, I believe there are some possibility of corruption=\r\n in the teachings of almost all masters starting from Jesus to Buddha to Sh=\r\nanakara to Guru Nanak to Chaitanya to Vivekanada to Aurobindo . Corruptions=\r\n not in the teaching per se but corruption arising out of misinterpretation=\r\n of the words over time. One cannot really blame them for this because it i=\r\ns almost impossible to forsee what turn of events lead to what kind of mind=\r\nsets which can make their statements/advises defuct or even dangerous over =\r\ntime.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; For example, Jesus says I am the path. Obviously Christians=\r\n have mistook this to understand that Jesus is the only path. What he ment =\r\nby I may not be Jesus the man, but Jesus the idea - of purity and of love.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Buddha gave a practical advise that Nirvana is sunya and practica=\r\nl spirituality is more important than spiritual discussion. People mistook =\r\nthat to understand Budha was as atheist.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Shanakara, the great man=\r\n that he was, would have died of a heart attack if he saw the flippant way =\r\nin which we later day college educated Indians use the phrases like Aham Br=\r\nahmasmi and everything is Brahman as if we are speaking about the latest mo=\r\nvie in town.  Also I feel his misjudged certain paths like Tantra.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Guru Nanak in order to infuse more life into spirituality of Hindus as we=\r\nll as Muslims and bring a comprise in the two ideas decried practises like =\r\nidol worship and pitri tarpan.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Chaitanya was the emotional pinnac=\r\nle of spirituality. He was capable. Others less capable misunderstood the p=\r\nath to feel that without shedding bucket full of tears you wont land at God=\r\n&#39;s doorsteps. Emotions are good, but they can mislead too.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Viveka=\r\nnanda - absolute leader. Like all leaders, he does make some statements at =\r\ntimes which are not well deliberated upon, which results in misinterpretati=\r\nons later on. Of course a leader cannot be expected to think for ten days b=\r\nefore speaking one  sentence. A leader has to be spontaneous, just like Viv=\r\nekanada, but the price of spontaneity is misrepresentation at a later date =\r\nspecially if you are fantastic.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Aurobindo, brilliant and rare ana=\r\nlysis of spiritual steps/stages. One that I have never found in any other w=\r\nriting. However the problem is exactly the same. Often people wrongly belie=\r\nve that only by reading and intellectually comprehending Aurobindo;s writin=\r\ngs one can make spiritual progress. There is no substitute for raw old fash=\r\nioned sadhana.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Please note all these are great men were without q=\r\nuestion, spiritually much realized. I am merely doing an intellectual analy=\r\nsis from a historial perspective.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; And then Ramakrishna, such a va=\r\nst range of emotions and practices coupled with simple and pointed examples=\r\n and advises, it is hardly possible for him to get misinterpreted. He uses =\r\nShanakra&#39;s phrase &quot;Brahma satya jagat mithya&quot; but he also teaches Totapuri =\r\nwhy Mahamaya is so powerful. He seems like a perfect assimilation of all id=\r\neas.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Just my two cents. \n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- On =\r\nFri, 20/11/09, vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: vedic_=\r\npathak &lt;vedic_pathak@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: How Ramakrishna d=\r\neals with a debater.\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Friday,=\r\n 20 November, 2009, 9:17 PM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;That is th=\r\ne effect of Ramakrishna, who was born and brought up in a &gt;village in west =\r\nbengal, who probably could not even sign his own &gt;name.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishn=\r\na, whom i lovingly address as &#39;Thakur&#39; is simply Rama and Krishna and no le=\r\nss......\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; And Kathamruta is THE book which has given answers and co=\r\nnfirmations to my queries and understandings which haunted me from childhoo=\r\nd.

The brahmani =\r\n- who was Thakur&#39;s guru - had called Gauri for a session of discussion on t=\r\nhe spiritual abilities etc of Thakur. Now Gauri was a very famous debater a=\r\nnd a sadhaka=C3=82 who never lost any debate. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Plus Thakur used to sa=\r\ny that Gauri had remakrable siddhis. He used to perform a homa of Ma Kali b=\r\ny stretching out his left hand, piling wood on the bare=C3=82 arm, lighting=\r\n it and then using his right hand to pour ghee! And the homa would last for=\r\n an hour or more and he would keep his left hand perfectly still all this w=\r\nhile. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; He had a certain siddhi in the use of a mantra o=\r\nf Ma Kali by virtue of which one could never win in a debate=C3=82 against =\r\nhim. Plus he had a deep, resounding voice which Ramakrishna described as th=\r\ne &quot;rumbling of clouds&quot;.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; When Gauri entered the Dakshine=\r\nshwar temple precinct and saw the Kali temple, he started repeating the man=\r\ntra mentally. Thakur at that time was coming out of the temple. On seeing G=\r\nauri suddenly Ramakrishna started saying that specific mantra (the one Gaur=\r\ni was chanting) loudly so that Gauri could hear. Gauri, on being thus chall=\r\nanged=C3=82 started shouting the mantra even louded. To this Ramakrishna fe=\r\nlt as if someone had just given him a divine voice and he too thundered bac=\r\nk. Gauri was even more amazed. He roared again=C3=82 but Ramakrishna roared=\r\n louder. Finally, suddenly Gauri realized he has lost his voice. And his si=\r\nddhi too! \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; At first he was furious with anger and ego b=\r\nut soon he became friends with Ramakrishna. Finally he proclaimed that Rama=\r\nkrishna was He by a fraction of whose power do Avatars come down on earth. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Later one day Gauri came to Ramakrishna asking for his=\r\n blessing to take sanyasa. He quit debating and went away from that place, =\r\npromising that he would not return untill he realized the Self. Thakur also=\r\n blessed him according.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; That is the effec=\r\nt of Ramakrishna, who was born and brought up in a village in west bengal, =\r\nwho probably could not even sign his own name.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =C3=82 Rajarshi\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
