One of the most astonishing=\r\n  features on the Internet has been the overnight democratization (and sadl=\r\ny, also the rapidly qualitatively degenerating nature) of the flow of infor=\r\nmation - both good, as well as fabricated. No longer do statements need to =\r\nbe reasonable. No longer do pronouncement need to be proven by fact, logic =\r\nor anything remotely resembling evidence. No longer do words have consequen=\r\nces.  ...And the degenerative influence of the Kali Yuga continues its incr=\r\nemental descent - with Truth itself as its foremost victim. \n\nOn the upside=\r\n, this radical lack of responsibility in the creation of written content ha=\r\ns also led to some of the most side-splitting humor imaginable. One fantast=\r\nic example of the type of reality-bending humor that has become very popula=\r\nr recently is the Onion (http://www.theonion.com). The Onion is especially =\r\nknown for taking normative reality and turning it completely upside down, r=\r\neporting the most unimaginably insane stories as if they are real news item=\r\ns, thus leading to many surrealistically funny fake news stories. Some stor=\r\nies even tricking otherwise intelligent people for at least a little while,=\r\n until they finally realize that they&#39;re only having their leg sardonically=\r\n pulled. \n\nWhat happens, however, when someone approaches you with the most=\r\n insane of statements, indeed the very opposite of reality, only for you to=\r\n then slowly and frighteningly realize that the person isn&#39;t actually jokin=\r\ng with you at all, but is dead serious in what she is saying? &quot;I believe th=\r\nat the Pope of the Catholic church is in actually a deep undercover Hindu s=\r\npy who is trying to get all Catholics to begin worshiping Lord Krishna and =\r\nto shave their heads! And I believe that Sri Swami Ramdev is actually a Chr=\r\nistian missionary in disguise, only pretending to be a Hindu! After all, ar=\r\nen&#39;t Christians anti-gay too; and didn&#39;t Jesus have long hair like Swami Ra=\r\nmdev?! You see? He&#39;s a Christian! And I know for a fact that Barack Obama, =\r\nthe current President of the United States, is actually a space alien in di=\r\nsguise here on a mission to conquer the earth for his fellow aliens!!!&quot; At =\r\nthis point in the conversation, of course, any sane person would begin to s=\r\nlowly back away from the troubled individual making these insane statements=\r\n and try to find safe shelter somewhere. Why? Because any intelligent perso=\r\nn would quickly realize that the statements that are being made are not mer=\r\nely false, not merely baseless, not merely mistaken, but are in fact so muc=\r\nh the opposite of any recognizable degree of reality that one would not eve=\r\nn know where to begin in attempting to refute them. How, for example, would=\r\n you personally even begin to disprove that Barack Obama is a space alien? =\r\nHow could you disprove that YOU are not a space alien?\n\nHumorously, I have =\r\nmyself recently been the victim of just such a surreal scenario from some I=\r\nnternet jokester who no one in the Hindu community apparently has ever hear=\r\nd of before. About a week ago, I was having a phone conversation with one o=\r\nf the national leaders of the Hindu community in the U.K. We were discussin=\r\ng strategies for combating anti-Hindu discrimination when he finally asked =\r\nme if I was aware that there was some unknown person blogging her opinion t=\r\nhat I was not a true Hindu, but only a deep-undercover Christian missionary=\r\n malevolently bent upon converting innocent Indian Hindu youth to Christian=\r\nity. We both began laughing on the phone for what seemed to be a minute. Wh=\r\nen we both finally regained our composure, my Hindu friend in the U.K. said=\r\n to me &quot;Acharyaji, claiming that you are a Christian would be like claiming=\r\n that Adi Shankara was a actually a hidden Baptist missionary!&quot; But...such =\r\nis the nature of a new claim on the rough and wild frontier adventure known=\r\n as the Internet.\n\nAgain, where does one even begin in attempting to refute=\r\n a lie so surreal as to defy reality? The following is my humble attempt to=\r\n inject at least a modicum of reality into the realm of the surreal. I will=\r\n begin my foray into the upside-down reality of this unknown blogger, whom =\r\nneither I nor my Hindu friend in the U.K. had ever hear of, with the follow=\r\ning personal statement. \n\nMera naam Dharma Pravartaka Acharya hai. Mein Bha=\r\nratiya naheen huun. LEKIN MEIN HINDU HUUN! My religion is Sanatana Dharma, =\r\nmore commonly known as Hinduism. Sanatana Dharma is the only religion I hav=\r\ne ever followed or been a member of in my 48 years of life on this earthly =\r\nplane of Bhudevi. I accept the Vedic scriptures as being the perfect reveal=\r\ned truth, the most reliable guide to understanding the nature of the cosmos=\r\n and our place within that cosmos, and as being apaurusheya - eternal and n=\r\not created by the mind of man. I accept that any religious or philosophical=\r\n path that does not accept the absolute authority of the Vedic scriptures i=\r\ns nastika, a necessarily flawed system of belief. I accept the reality of k=\r\narma and reincarnation. I accept the reality of the devas and devis as real=\r\n and existing personalities who govern and guide our cosmos in a dharmic ma=\r\nnner. I have been a strict vegetarian for the last 36 years, do not drink a=\r\nlcohol, nor smoke, nor engage in illegal drugs (aspirin, I believe, is stil=\r\nl legal), etc. I personally worship Sriman Narayana as the highest understa=\r\nnding of Brahman and the ultimate goal of Vedanta. On a daily basis, I cond=\r\nuct puja to the murtis of Sri Sri Radha Krishna, engage in mantra meditatio=\r\nn upon the Vedic mantra Aum Namo Narayanaya, practice Yoga, etc. I was init=\r\niated into the Narayana mantra at the age of fourteen in a Hindu temple in =\r\nNew York City. I travelled to India in 1985 to receive direct initiation fr=\r\nom my guru Bhakti Rakshaka Sridhara Swami Maharaja (as is clearly stated in=\r\n my biographical information on my website, http://www.dharmacentral.com, b=\r\nut which the Unknown Blogger apparently failed to read), the elder god-brot=\r\nher of the world famous A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada. I traveled to =\r\nIndia again in 1986 to receive brahmana initiation and the sacred thread fr=\r\nom my guru. Thus, I recite the gayatri mantra thrice daily, as instructed b=\r\ny my guru, and live a fully brahminical life. Thus, MEIN HINDU HUUN!\n\nMore,=\r\n as if it even needs to be said at this point (though, apparently for this =\r\nUnknown Blogger at least, it does!), MEIN ISSAI NAHEEN HUUN. I am not, and =\r\nnever have been, a Christian. My dad was of Italian heritage; my mom is Spa=\r\nnish. They were both nominal Catholics; i.e., they did not practice the rel=\r\nigion. I was never baptized as a Christian - which is the criterion by whic=\r\nh one is considered to be a formal member of the Catholic church. I believe=\r\n my parents brought me to a church a total of two times as a child - once f=\r\nor a funeral, the other time for a wedding. I was never a Christian in any =\r\nway, shape or form, either by theological concurrence, in practice, or in m=\r\nembership. When I began practicing Sanatana Dharma at the age of ten, this =\r\nwas the first and only religion that I had ever practiced. More, Ms. blogge=\r\nr whom no one in the Hindu community has ever even heard of, and whom I hav=\r\ne never met in my life:  I may not have been &quot;born a Hindu&quot; - but I will di=\r\ne a Hindu, with tilak on my forehead, with the name &quot;Narayana&quot; on my tongue=\r\n, and with Bhagavan Sri Krishna in my heart. MEIN HINDU HUUN.  \n\nAs we are =\r\nabout to see, our Unknown Blogger offers zero credible evidence that I have=\r\n been lying to the world for the last 38 years, and am really a Christian s=\r\necret agent in disguise. Apparently, the main quibble that the Unknown Blog=\r\nger had with my work to share Sanatana Dharma with the world was one video =\r\nof a satsang I had conducted in which I explain that, though we Hindus do n=\r\not accept the religion of Christianity, we do indeed accept the saintliness=\r\n and wisdom of Jesus as evidence that he was a great Dharma master. The Unk=\r\nnown Blogger even made the shrieking claim that I was attempting to convert=\r\n innocent Hindu youth to Christianity with my talk! Well, the very opposite=\r\n, of course, was the case. Of the approximately 100 people in attendance at=\r\n my satsang that evening, approximately 85 were European-Americans of the J=\r\nudeo-Christian persuasion. The other 15 attendees were European-American fo=\r\nllowers of Sanatana Dharma (and, thus, ex-Christians), whom I had personall=\r\ny introduced to Sanatana Dharma. Not one innocent Indian Hindu youth in sig=\r\nht. Indeed, my audiences these days are primarily composed of European-Amer=\r\nican adults. The last time I gave a talk to Hindu youth specifically was al=\r\nmost five years ago. And when I did give that talk five years ago, my messa=\r\nge to this audience of Hindu youth was that they should all be swelling wit=\r\nh pride to be followers of Sanatana Dharma - the most ancient, most relevan=\r\nt, most beautiful spiritual tradition the earth has ever known! \n\nMore, the=\r\n Hindu perspective on the personality of Jesus that I communicated in my vi=\r\ndeo - namely that we respect Jesus as a great guru, but we completely rejec=\r\nt Christianity as a highly flawed theological and organizational system - h=\r\nas been the exact same message given by thousands of other respected Hindu =\r\ngurus and Hindu leaders. The perspective on Jesus discussed in the video is=\r\n not dissimilar to that taught by Sri Ramakrishna, Swami Vivekananda, Param=\r\nahamsa Yogananda, Mahatma Gandhi, Maharishi Mahesh Yogi, A.C. Bhaktivedanta=\r\n Swami Prabhupada, etc., etc., etc., etc. I can mention a thousand more nam=\r\nes of other respected gurus who share my same message on this topic, but th=\r\nat would quadruple the length of this article unnecessarily!  Thus, if I am=\r\n guilty of being a hidden Christian missionary spy because I have conveyed =\r\nthe standard Hindu message on the acceptance of Jesus/rejection of Christia=\r\nnity, then so are all of these illustrious gurus, who all shared the same o=\r\npinion as me. These great Hindu gurus must all be hidden Christian missiona=\r\nries!  I am very humbled to have been put into such glorious company by our=\r\n Unknown Blogger. \n\nThe video &quot;Jesus: The Dharma Master&quot; was designed speci=\r\nfically for a Christian audience in order to introduce them to the path of =\r\nSanatana Dharma. It has served as a highly effective transitional bridge fo=\r\nr thousands of Christians who wish to learn more about the beauty of Sanata=\r\nna Dharma, and to possibly even choose to adopt Sanatana Dharma as their ne=\r\nw spiritual path. This Hindu video will stay up in the service of Sanatana =\r\nDharma for as long as there is such a vehicle as the Internet in existence.=\r\n \n\nAnother stunningly shocking piece of evidence that our Unknown Blogger d=\r\neposited upon her readers for my secret Christian identity (I can imagine t=\r\nhat the Unknown Blogger envisions that when my fellow Hindus aren&#39;t watchin=\r\ng, I quickly run into a phone booth to then, like Superman,  emerge wearing=\r\n a cape with a large blue cross emblazoned upon it!) is the fact that...wai=\r\nt for it...wait for it...&quot;He went to a Christian university for his bachelo=\r\nr&#39;s degree!!!&quot; Such smoking gun evidence! Of course, what is left out (whic=\r\nh, along with a thousand other details about my life, must be left out by n=\r\necessity, since this blogger has never met me, has never spoken to me, and =\r\nknows absolutely nothing about my life other than what she read - and conve=\r\nniently forgot to read - on my own website) is precisely why I attended a C=\r\natholic university (Loyola University Chicago) for four years of my ten yea=\r\nr college career. A) I was living in Chicago at the time, and Loyola was on=\r\ne of the best universities in the city, B) I was a philosophy major, and Lo=\r\nyola had one of the best philosophy departments in America at that time, C)=\r\n having already been a practicing Hindu for 17 years before even beginning =\r\nat Loyola, I very purposefully wanted to study the world-view of the opposi=\r\ntion! Being a Hindu whose goal was to eventually teach Sanatana Dharma in t=\r\nhe predominantly Judeo-Christian west, I felt it was imperative that I lear=\r\nn as much about the Christian world-view as possible. Which I did. And whic=\r\nh even more Hindu gurus, scholars and leaders should also be doing in their=\r\n spare time if they want the ability to defend Sanatana Dharma against all =\r\nopposing world-views!\n\nDuring my four year stay at Loyola University, I was=\r\n very open and vocal about my religion of Sanatana Dharma. I organized a we=\r\nekly Bhagavad Gita study group on campus - the very first such Hindu group =\r\nin the history of this Catholic institution of higher learning! I engaged i=\r\nn open, frank and friendly debates with Catholic priests and philosophers d=\r\nefending the dignity of Sanatana Dharma, and more, demonstrating the pre-em=\r\ninence of the philosophical world-view of Sanatana Dharma over and above an=\r\nything available in the totality of Christian theology. \n\nOn an allied subj=\r\nect, this Unknown Blogger who has taken it upon herself to proclaim who amo=\r\nng we mortal creatures is or is not a true Hindu states in her own little b=\r\niographical blurb that she was &quot;an instructor at a Canadian college&quot; for a =\r\nshort time. That she purposefully does not mention the actual name of this =\r\n&quot;Canadian college&quot; makes us doubt the veracity of this claim. More, if she =\r\nwere actually associated in any way with the academic world anywhere in Nor=\r\nth America, then Ms. Blogger would have been quite aware that there are usu=\r\nally many hundreds of Indian Hindu students attending any one Christian uni=\r\nversity in America. Indeed, at Loyola alone there were many hundreds of Ind=\r\nian Hindu students happily studying medicine, engineering, computer technol=\r\nogy, and a wide variety of other fields of study. Are all of these hundreds=\r\n of Hindu students who attended Loyola (and tens of thousands of Hindu stud=\r\nents combined if we include all the other Christian universities in America=\r\n that have large Hindu student populations) just like I did now going to ha=\r\nve their adherence and loyalty to Hinduism arrogantly challenged by Ms. Blo=\r\ngger because they, too, &quot;attended Christian universities&quot;? \n\nIndeed, as any=\r\n Indian knows, many millions of good, loyal Hindus in India have attended s=\r\nchools with such names as &quot;St. Joseph&#39;s&quot;, &quot;St. Mary&#39;s&quot;, &quot;St. John&#39;s&quot;. Indee=\r\nd, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada attended a college =\r\nby the name of &quot;Scottish Churches College&quot;, which was a college run by a Ch=\r\nristian church! (Indeed, I suspect that if anyone actually knew who this bl=\r\nogger is and what her own personal history is, they would, not surprisingly=\r\n, be able to dig up a few photos of our darling little Ms. Blogger as a you=\r\nng girl, dressed in a Catholic school uniform as she attended St. Bartholom=\r\new&#39;s Christian Academy or some other such &quot;Christian&quot; school). Does Ms. Blo=\r\ngger now want to apply her &quot;logic&quot; (we&#39;re being kind, I know) equally and a=\r\ncross the board and now say that all of these millions of good Hindus who a=\r\nttended Christian run educational facilities are now no longer Hindus? With=\r\n friends like Ms. Blogger so eager to convert so many millions of Hindu stu=\r\ndents to Christianity by vicious innuendo, and thus doing more harm to our =\r\nHindu culture than every Christian missionary in India combined, does the H=\r\nindu world even need any enemies!\n\nAnd contemporary Sanatana Dharma does in=\r\ndeed have more than enough enemies actively seeking its thorough destructio=\r\nn! With Islamic Jihadists threatening to create a caliphate in India, aggre=\r\nssive Christian missionaries forcing Hindus to abandon their Vedic heritage=\r\n for the promise of a bag of rice and a free pass out of their Biblical hel=\r\nl, demonic Marxist terrorists seeking to annihilate everything Hindu and re=\r\nplace it with a totalitarian atheist state, we have our hands more than ful=\r\nl if our goal is to preserve our ancient Vedic heritage for future generati=\r\nons to celebrate and honor. What, then, has really motivated our Unknown Bl=\r\nogger to devote her energy, instead, to waging an unprovoked assault agains=\r\nt an American Hindu who has practiced the Vedic religion for 38 years and d=\r\nevoted his every breath to its preservation? The painfully obvious answer t=\r\no this question leads us ominously away from the humorous and toward the tr=\r\nuly ugly and malevolent reality of the Unknown Blogger&#39;s own personal inner=\r\n demons. \n\nThe core theme of the Unknown Blogger&#39;s vicious personal attack =\r\nhas not really been the camouflaged accusation that I am not a real Hindu, =\r\nbut rather the ugly insistence that, given my racial and ethnic background,=\r\n I CANNOT be a real Hindu. In her poorly constructed screed, the Blogger ta=\r\nkes great pains to point out to her small audience that my father is of Ita=\r\nlian ethnic heritage and my mother is of Spanish ethnic heritage. Why was t=\r\nhis fact about my racial makeup so importantly highlighted by the Blogger? =\r\nWhat does the race of my parents, or the color of their skin, or the makeup=\r\n of their DNA have to do with the fact that their son chose at an early age=\r\n to devote his life to the religion and culture of Sanatana Dharma? \n\nIn or=\r\nder to forcefully reiterate my ethnic makeup in the minds of her innocent r=\r\neaders, the bigoted and racist Unknown Blogger gleefully and childishly ins=\r\nisted on referring to me, ad nauseum, by my pre-Hindu name &quot;Frank Morales&quot; =\r\nrepeatedly throughout her hate-filled, jumbled article. Apparently this &quot;fo=\r\nrmer instructor at a Canadian College&quot;, and thus a purportedly, at least so=\r\nmewhat educated individual, actually believes that being a follower of Sana=\r\ntana Dharma indicates one&#39;s physical race! Apparently she believes that the=\r\nre exists somewhere in some abstract realm of ideation a &quot;race&quot; of Christia=\r\nns; a &quot;race&quot; of Muslims; a &quot;race&quot; of Buddhists; and most obviously she beli=\r\neves that there exists somewhere in her surreal fantasy world a &quot;race&quot; of S=\r\nanatana Dharmis. Is there a &quot;race&quot; of Communists; a &quot;race&quot; of left-handers;=\r\n a &quot;race&quot; of unknown bloggers? According to the Unknown Blogger...apparentl=\r\ny so! This sad bigot thus betrays her simple-minded inability to even disti=\r\nnguish between one&#39;s genetic inheritance (over which one has no choice) and=\r\n one&#39;s chosen religious identity (which involves nothing but choice). Thus,=\r\n within the darkly bigoted and racist mind of the Unknown Blogger, Dharma P=\r\nravartaka Acharya (or conversely: &quot;Frank Morales&quot;/&quot;Frank Morales&quot;/&quot;Frank Mo=\r\nrales&quot;, to quote Bloggie) CANNOT be a Hindu - He&#39;s the wrong color!\n\nAnd, a=\r\ns the Unknown Racist Blogger would have it, he has the wrong parents...\n\nFo=\r\nr those Hindus who are a bit more informed about the philosophical foundati=\r\nons of Sanatana Dharma than the Unknown Bigot (which is apparently about 98=\r\n% of today&#39;s Hindus), of course, we know that Sanatana Dharma is not a race=\r\n. It is not a skin color. It is not an indication of who your parents are. =\r\nIt is not a matter of what nation&#39;s passport you happen to carry.  Rather, =\r\nSanatana Dharma is the Eternal Natural Way. It is a spiritual path, a divin=\r\ne culture, a healthy and sane way of living and viewing reality that is ope=\r\nn to all human beings, regardless of whether they are Indian, European, Ame=\r\nrican, Japanese or of any other ethnicity. Sanatana Dharma is a gift from G=\r\nod. Sanatana Dharma is the future salvation of our entire planet.\n\nIndeed, =\r\none of the most central and basic siddhantas, or philosophical conclusions,=\r\n of Vedanta teaches us precisely that the very beginning of jnana (spiritua=\r\nl knowledge) is realizing that we are not merely our race, our color, our e=\r\nthnicity, our parentage, our name, our gender, our education level, our age=\r\n, our language, our species, our very body itself, or any other material or=\r\n physical factor. According to the totality of all the scriptures of Sanata=\r\nna Dharma, we are atman, each and every one of us. We are eternal, blissful=\r\n units of consciousness. To have a grasp of so fundamental and basic a phil=\r\nosophical concept is merely the beginning of spiritual insight, of nobility=\r\n (aryatva), and of what it means to be a follower of Sanatana Dharma. Appar=\r\nently, the Unknown Bigot was asleep in kindergarten during this important, =\r\nbasic lesson. \n\nOver the last 38 years, I have had the greatest privilege o=\r\nf working very closely with tens of thousands of members of the Indian Hind=\r\nu community in America and abroad. In those 38 years, the Indian Hindu comm=\r\nunity has opened its arms to me in warm embrace, with so many inviting me t=\r\no their homes, sharing their wisdom with me, welcoming me to their temples =\r\nand satsangs, treating me as someone no different from a family member. I h=\r\nave experienced a degree of genuine love, concern and unhesitating generous=\r\nness of heart from Indian Hindus so profound as to leave me in tears. I hav=\r\ne seen quiet humility, deep bhakti, innocent piousness, and a pride in thei=\r\nr Hindu religion on the part of many Hindus that has moved me to the core o=\r\nf my being. My gurus, teachers and mentors have been Hindus of Indian desce=\r\nnt. My best friends, colleagues and closest confidents are Indians. Roughly=\r\n half of my shishyas (students) are proud and courageous Indian Hindus who =\r\nhave dedicated their hearts and their very being to the healthy and positiv=\r\ne growth of Sanatana Dharma as an ascendant global force for good. My trips=\r\n to India have astonished, humbled and amazed me to the grandeur of a natio=\r\nn, a people, and a culture that have kept alive the spirit of the Vedas for=\r\n over five-thousand years. My trips to India changed my life forever. \n\nSad=\r\nly, while 98% of Indian Hindus understand quite well that Sanatana Dharma i=\r\ns a religion that is open to all sincere seekers of Truth, regardless of th=\r\neir race or ethnic background, there does remain the tiny, but (as we have =\r\nseen with the Unknown Bigot), very vocal 2% of bigots who see Sanatana Dhar=\r\nma as the closed property of the few, racially-tested, elite. The Unknown B=\r\nigot has sadly chosen of her own free volition to be the blogger spokespers=\r\non for the latter, small and truly intellectually lethargic and morally cor=\r\nrupt cabal. \n\nThat an ultimately ignorant and prejudiced bigot should so at=\r\ntempt to ruin the reputation of the vast majority of the Indian Hindu commu=\r\nnity by pretending that her mean-spirited and ugly assault upon an American=\r\n follower of Sanatana Dharma represents the totality of the Indian Hindu co=\r\nmmunity breaks my heart. If you are an Indian who takes Hinduism seriously,=\r\n and who loves your spiritual heritage, it should anger your heart. I call =\r\nupon the entirety of the Hindu community, all Sanatana Dharmis globally, wh=\r\nether Indian, American, European, men and women, young and old, human and D=\r\neva, to renounce the Unknown Bigot in one loud, united and courageous voice=\r\n. I call upon all leaders, scholars, gurus and activists in the Hindu commu=\r\nnity to bravely denounce the repulsive attacks of this person upon our enti=\r\nre community. We member of the Hindu community WILL defend the dignity of S=\r\nanatana Dharma from all asuras, from all unprovoked assaults, and from bigo=\r\nted Unknown Bloggers everywhere. We WILL celebrate Sanatana Dharma as a div=\r\nine, spiritual path open to all sincere seekers, regardless of their race, =\r\nor the race of their parents. We WILL see the reconstruction of Vedic civil=\r\nization in our very lifetimes. Evam bhavatu.\n\nThis will be my only statemen=\r\nt on the embarrassingly sad case of the Unknown Bigot.
