As a result, agni=\r\n became\n&gt; distressed. Through his yogic power, agni always divided himself =\r\nand\n&gt; remained present in all homas and other sacrifices. He took the offer=\r\nings\n&gt; made in the fire to the respective beings. But, he did not want to e=\r\nat\n&gt; anything that was impure. After bhrigu&#39;s curse, he decided to withdraw=\r\n\n&gt; himself from all homas.\n&gt; \n&gt; Both the rishis who made offerings in agni =\r\nand the devas who received these\n&gt; offerings were distressed and went to Br=\r\nahma. They asked Brahma how agni\n&gt; could eat both sacred and vulger things.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Brahma now summons agni and asks him how he could withdraw himself fr=\r\nom\n&gt; homa and other sacrifices, as agni was the creator, sustainer and dest=\r\nroyer\n&gt; of the three lokas. He then advises agni and tells him that he woul=\r\nd not\n&gt; have to consume vulgar offerings with his entire body. Only a parti=\r\ncular\n&gt; portion of agni would have to consume impure offerings. Even those\n=\r\n&gt; offerings would become pure the moment they were consumed by agni, and ag=\r\nni\n&gt; himself would remain pure. Brahma thus asked agni to remain the &#39;eater=\r\n of\n&gt; all things&#39;, and agni agreed.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; **********\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Through this=\r\n divine play between Bhrighu, Agni and Brahma, all of us have\n&gt; benefited. =\r\nThough we make both pure and impure offerings (both physical and\n&gt; mental),=\r\n the ever pure Agni remains present in our homas. He remains\n&gt; unaffected, =\r\nand purifies each and every one of our offerings. As we spend\n&gt; more and mo=\r\nre time with Agni, the impure within us slowly becomes pure.\n&gt; \n&gt; sasneham,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;     ajit\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
