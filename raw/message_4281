As long as one remains in duality, there i=\r\ns always a chance of being deluded. However, with due respect, I wish to ma=\r\nke a *critical* note with my 2 cents on various realted and unrelated issue=\r\ns. Please allow me.\n \n&gt;  Because of the ignorance of the mind experiencing =\r\na sense of difference\n&gt; [bheda-buddhi] in Self, [even] great devas are dist=\r\nurbed by fear.\n&gt; [Therefore] it is wise to remain without fear in the supre=\r\nme state of\n&gt; non-duality, having attained the reality, one=E2=80=99s own S=\r\nelf, through negation\n&gt; [of the non-Self].\n \nIt is certainly wise to &quot;remai=\r\nn without fear in the supreme state of non-duality&quot;. However, as you pointe=\r\nd out, &quot;[even] great devas are disturbed by fear&quot;. Then how easy can it be =\r\nfor other beings, including members of this list, to &quot;remain without fear i=\r\nn the supreme state of non-duality&quot;?\n \nPlease don&#39;t get me wrong. I am not =\r\nagainst adwaita or non-duality at all, as those familiar with my writings s=\r\nhould know by now. But I accept the fact that a huge majority of spiritual =\r\nseekers are meant to remain in duality for many many more lives. A message =\r\nother than &quot;attain the supreme state of non-duality&quot; may be more useful to =\r\nthem at their current stage!\n \n*        *        *\n \nA great cricket batsma=\r\nn may not make the greatest coach. Hitting the ball may seem so easy to him=\r\n and he may simply say, &quot;look at the ball and hit it.&quot; That much instructio=\r\nn is certainly not enough for a budding player to start playing like that g=\r\nreat player.\n \nAnother gifted coach may observe faults in the technique of =\r\nthe budding player and give some tips. That may turn out to be more useful =\r\nthan the inspiring words from the great player! Of course, no matter how go=\r\nod instructions one gets, the budding player may not play like that great p=\r\nlayer anytime soon! Nevertheless, his goal should be to keep improving!\n \n*=\r\n        *        *\n \nSome great teachers, especially of the Adwaita philoso=\r\nphy, are like the great cricket batsman in the above analogy. They tell you=\r\n what is obvious and natural to *them*. Their words are very inspiring.\n \nS=\r\nome other teachers fine-tune their message for an audience. They show a rea=\r\nl path (instead of a lofty target) using which one can start making progres=\r\ns. One may or may not reach a supreme state anytime soon, but one will star=\r\nt making progress.\n \n*        *        *\n \nDifferent spiritual teachers com=\r\ne for different purposes. The role played by each one is important in its o=\r\nwn right. Ramana maharshi was undoubtedly a great master. However, when it =\r\ncomes to the second category of teachers I mentioned above, one name that s=\r\ntrikes to me instantly is that of Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. He was a master =\r\nat fine-tuning his message for the individual. While most great masters wer=\r\ne adepts in one path (jnaana yoga or bhakti yoga or karma yoga or raja yoga=\r\n), he was unique in that he experienced the supreme through each path and w=\r\nas equally comfortable guiding people in jnaana, vedanta, Raama bhakti, Kri=\r\nshna bhakti, Kaali bhakti, Shiva bhakti, karma yoga, service, hatha yoga, t=\r\nantra etc, having experienced all. He even did smashana sadhanas, Islamic s=\r\nadhanas and experienced Jesus Christ. He is a unique teacher in the last fe=\r\nw millennia. Many other masters take disciples on the path they walked. Hav=\r\ning walked all paths to the summit, Ramakrishna guided disciples on differe=\r\nnt paths based on their aptitude.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThough upanishads=\r\n and Bhagavad Gita are teaching Adwaita clearly, some great masters came in=\r\n the last few millennia who taught variations in the Upanishadic philosophy=\r\n veering towards duality to various degrees. I think this happened for a pu=\r\nrpose. As true Adwaita as taught by Upanishads and Bhagavad Gita becomes mo=\r\nre and more inappropriate and difficult for the masses, a simpler message t=\r\nhat they can understand and that can guide their spiritual lives is needed.=\r\n I think the coming of various masters who taught different philosophies is=\r\n for that reason.\n \n*        *        *\n \nThe title of the mail was &quot;Fearle=\r\nssness Comes In The Supreme State Of Non-duality&quot;. However, the question is=\r\n: Does non-duality bring fearlessness or vice versa?\n \nA realization of non=\r\n-dual Self may suddenly happen oneday for some rare persons. For most, it h=\r\nappens as a result of sadhana done over many years/lives. Thus, qualities l=\r\nike dispassion, fearlessness (which are associated with the supreme state) =\r\nneed to be cultivated actively. As they become more and more perfected, one=\r\n gets closer and closer to Self-realization.\n \nSuppose one sees a beautiful=\r\n/ugly object (or a desirable/undesirable object). When one feels attraction=\r\n/aversion, one should remind oneself &quot;all is god (Self). There is no need f=\r\nor feeling attraction/aversion towards anything.&quot; When one feels fear, one =\r\nshould remind oneself &quot;all is god (Self). There is no need for be afraid of=\r\n *anything*&quot;. As one practices this, one&#39;s dispassion and fearlessness incr=\r\nease. Incidents of delusion becomes smaller and less frequent. Eventually, =\r\none overcomes.\n \nBut the tricky part is that one needs to perform the actio=\r\nns one is meant to perform and work out the kaarmik debts, before one reali=\r\nzes Self. It is very difficult to perform actions without feeling even smal=\r\nl amounts of attachment, attraction, aversion, passion, fear etc.\n \nA simpl=\r\ne formula is: Give all you can and expect nothing (and accept whatever you =\r\nget) in return. In the beginning, any attraction/aversion/anxiety/fear you =\r\nfeel should be with regard to what are giving to others and not with regard=\r\n to what you are expecting from others.\n \n*        *        *\n \nIt is all e=\r\nasy to write and read theory. The problem comes when one is tested in real =\r\nlife. For example, I choked when eating something once when I was alone and=\r\n could not breathe. I became anxious and it made it worse. Suddenly, the th=\r\nought came to me &quot;what are you afraid of? Death? This will mostly result in=\r\n a little suffering for a couple of minutes and no more. EVEN IF it results=\r\n in death, what is the big deal? Jaatasya dhruvam mrityuh (each being who i=\r\ns born is sure of deatth). Is there anything I wanted to do and could not d=\r\no? Well, there may be, but someone else can do it. Why should only Narasimh=\r\na do it? World will run perfectly fine even if I am not here. If I indeed d=\r\nie now, why don&#39;t I meditate and focus my mind on god, instead of focusing =\r\non my life and getting anxious?&quot; I relaxed and meditated for a few minutes =\r\nwith Gayatri mantra. My anxiety went away and I felt nice after a while.\n \n=\r\nAs one detects and actively suppresses undesirable thoughts more and more, =\r\nsuch thoughts will become less and less frequent and eventually be suppress=\r\ned by the mind even in the seed/formatory state. Later, causes of those see=\r\nds themselves will be wiped out from the sub-conscious mind. This is how co=\r\nnditioning of the mind is slowly overcome. It is certainly a long process f=\r\nor most of us, but one loses nothing by starting and trying to make progres=\r\ns. Sadhanas like homam and japam aid one in this.\n \nPlease note that even R=\r\namana maharshi and Ramakrishna Paramahamsa did intense sadhana for many yea=\r\nrs, before they could reach the supreme state. No matter who you are, some =\r\nsadhana is needed.\n \n*        *        *\n \nWhile on the topic of Adwaita, I=\r\n want to make one more point. It poses two dangers. While the Ultimate Real=\r\nity is indeed non-dual, *half-baked* understanding of Adwaita philosophy ca=\r\nn make one *trivialize* duality on one extreme or *glorify* ignorance on th=\r\ne other extreme. Let me explain.\n \nReading that the ultimate reality behind=\r\n all that we see is the non-dual Self can make some people trivialize the d=\r\nuality that we normally experience. If duality is &quot;mithya&quot; (an illusion), h=\r\now does it matter and how do our actions within it matter? It is all, after=\r\n all, an illusion.\n \nOf course, a true student of vedanta will know that th=\r\ne layer of illusion is quite important and cannot be ignored simply because=\r\n it is an &quot;illusion&quot;. If one&#39;s consciousness is veiled by the layer of illu=\r\nsion, actions within that layer of illusion are required for removing it. I=\r\nt will not magically disappear. After all, yoga vaasishtham emphasizes &quot;act=\r\nions&quot; in the dual world for realizing non-dual Self. Action and knowledge a=\r\ns the two wings with which the bird of individualized consciousness rises f=\r\nrom the ground of duality to reach the sky of true Self.\n \nOn the other ext=\r\nreme, \n \n*        *        *\n \nEnough for now. I have not gone anywhere and=\r\n still reading the list regularly. But I did not have motivation to reply t=\r\no any recent mails. Basically, if I have no useful or meaningful comment/re=\r\nply, I keep quiet.\n \nIntellectual exchanges are interesting, but the thing =\r\nthat matters at the end of the day is whether we are doing sincere sadhana =\r\nor not and whether we are progressing or not. It seems to me like several p=\r\neople are sincerely doing homam/japam and sincerely trying to make progress=\r\n. Several more people are about to do the same. THAT is what really matters=\r\n. What we think or say about the world, duality and non-duality is irreleva=\r\nnt really. What matters is whether our attitude is changing for the better.=\r\n\n \n*        *        *\n \nLet me give one more quick analogy before I stop f=\r\nor now.\n \nSuppose one is sleeping and seeing an elaborate dream. Suppose on=\r\ne is fully absorbed in the dream and weeping in pain when something bad hap=\r\npens in the dream and laughing in elation when something good happens in th=\r\ne dream. One can tell that it is bad.\n \nSuppose another person has read *in=\r\n the dream* that what one is experiencing is called a &quot;dream&quot; and will end =\r\nsoon and what happens in the dream is irrelevant. Suppose one intellectuall=\r\ny understands all that and yet weeps in pain when something bad happens in =\r\nthe dream and laughs in elation when something good happens in the dream. I=\r\ns that any better? Of course not.\n \nOn the other hand, if one is slowly get=\r\nting control over the mind and not weeping as often and not laughing as oft=\r\nen, one is perhaps making progress.\n \n*        *        *\n \nDo whatever you=\r\nr conscience tells you to do. But expect nothing in return and accept whate=\r\nver comes to you as a result. As your acceptance increases, the clarity wit=\r\nh which your conscience shows you the path you should take (with regard to =\r\nyour actions) will become better and better. If your actions were bad in th=\r\ne past (due to unclear guidelines from conscience or not following your con=\r\nscience) and you are receiving bad fruits, you can still overcome it by lea=\r\nrning to accept what comes. As your acceptance is perfected, your conscienc=\r\ne and will power will become pure and your actions will become pure. As act=\r\nions become pure, newer fruits will be pure. Eventually, you start making p=\r\nrogress.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n----------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, =\r\nJyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri=\r\n Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that =\r\nmake a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com=\r\n/group/JyotishWritings\n----------------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------\n \n---- Prasanth Jalasutram &lt;jvrsprasanth@...&gt; wrote: =\r\n\n&gt;  Because of the ignorance of the mind experiencing a sense of difference=\r\n\n&gt; [bheda-buddhi] in Self, [even] great devas are disturbed by fear.\n&gt; [The=\r\nrefore] it is wise to remain without fear in the supreme state of\n&gt; non-dua=\r\nlity, having attained the reality, one=E2=80=99s own Self, through negation=\r\n\n&gt; [of the non-Self].\n&gt; \n&gt; Sadhu Om: The nature of jiva is to think that fe=\r\nar will be removed only when\n&gt; there is some other person with him. But thi=\r\ns idea is foolish. How can there\n&gt; be cause for fear in the state of Self, =\r\nwhere no other thing exists?\n&gt; \n&gt; Only in a state where there exists someth=\r\ning other than oneself is it\n&gt; possible for one either to have desire for t=\r\nhat thing or to have fear of it.\n&gt; Therefore, true fearlessness can be atta=\r\nined only in the non-dual state of\n&gt; Self, where no other thing exists.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; To illustrate how fearlessness can be attained only when one attains the\n=\r\n&gt; state of Self, Sri Bhagavan used to narrate the following story:\n&gt; \n&gt; Aft=\r\ner Lord Vishnu had killed Hiranya, Hiranya=E2=80=99s son Prahlada was happi=\r\nly\n&gt; ruling the kingdom.\n&gt; \n&gt; But after some time, a fear arose in Prahlada=\r\n. =E2=80=9CBecause Lord Vishnu is kind\n&gt; to me, I am living safely. But if =\r\none day He becomes angry with me, He will\n&gt; kill me just as He killed my fa=\r\nther,=E2=80=9D thought Prahlada.\n&gt; \n&gt; Being a great devotee of Lord Vishnu,=\r\n Prahlada had no one else to turn to,\n&gt; so he\n&gt; prayed to Him. The Lord imm=\r\nediately appeared before Prahlada,who then\n&gt; explained his fear and prayed =\r\nfor the state of fearlessness.\n&gt; \n&gt; =E2=80=9CYes,=E2=80=9D said Lord Vishnu=\r\n, =E2=80=9CYou are correct. By seeing me like this in name\n&gt; and form, you =\r\ncannot be free from fear.\n&gt; \n&gt; You must see me within yourself. Only when y=\r\nou thus realize me to be not\n&gt; different from yourself, will you attain the=\r\n state of fearlessness=E2=80=9D. Then\n&gt; the Lord taught him the path of Sel=\r\nf-enquiry. When Prahlada followed the\n&gt; Lord=E2=80=99s instructions and rea=\r\nlized Self, he attained the state of\n&gt; fearlessness.\n&gt; \n&gt; This story thus i=\r\nllustrates that even God cannot serve as permanent refuge\n&gt; from fear so lo=\r\nng as one retains the sense of difference [bheda-buddhi].\n&gt; Only by attaini=\r\nng the non-dual Self can one become truly and permanently\n&gt; free from fear.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Source: GURU VACHAKA KOVAI The Light of Supreme Truth or THE COLLECTI=\r\nON OF\n&gt; GURU=E2=80=99S SAYINGS translated from original Tamil By Sadhu Om a=\r\nnd Michael James\n&gt; \n&gt; Guru Vachaka Kovai is the biggest collection of Bhaga=\r\nvan=E2=80=99s spoken teachings\n&gt; that was thoroughly checked and revised by=\r\n him during his lifetime.
