Call it your duty! How do you know it is=\r\n your duty do some thing bad? We always have an option not to do it and exp=\r\neriance the consequence.\n\nLet us say, some one gives you a gun and says sho=\r\not him, or else I will shoot you. We have two options:\n1. Shoot the person\n=\r\n2. Deny to shoot\n\n\nIn the outset, the first option seem to be easy. But, lo=\r\n\n\nLook at possible outcome of your choice:\n1.1 The other person may still s=\r\nhoot you\n1.2 The other person may hit you and go\n1.3 The other person may h=\r\nit you and imprision you.\n1.4 The other person may continue forcing you to =\r\nkill few more\n\n2.1 Then other person may shoot you\n2.2 Other person may hit=\r\n you and go\n2.3 Other person may hit you and imprision you.\n\nAre we sure, w=\r\ne made the correct choice?\n\nApart from it, killnig some one to avoid your o=\r\nwn death may not be your duty! Knowing what is your duty is far more deffic=\r\nult than making choices best suited for your comfort, name and convenience.=\r\n\n\nSorry, if I am hurting any one, but, I thought, it is important to know t=\r\nhe difference between:\n1. Saying you did it because you had to do it\n2. Doi=\r\nng it because you had to do it.\n\nLike Narasimha pointed in another email, t=\r\nhese days the villan in the movie says &quot;Krishna made me kill. Who am I to k=\r\nill?&quot;\n\nAlso, pretending unattachedness for a bad karma is relatively easy. =\r\nPlease don&#39;t fall into the trap.\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com, uma shanker &lt;aliens19672004@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Do your duty an=\r\nd leave the rest to the god.=A0 Sri Krishna himself has advised Arjun about=\r\n doing ones=A0 Karma.=A0 We are here only to do things and not to think whe=\r\nther we are doing right or wrong.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 7/15/09,=\r\n rajesh_rajgor2003 &lt;rajesh_rajgor2003@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: rajesh_rajgor2=\r\n003 &lt;rajesh_rajgor2003@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Please help me\n&gt; To: =\r\nvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Wednesday, July 15, 2009, 1:16 PM\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;             \n&gt;             \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  =\r\n     \n&gt;       Shri Narsimha Guruji,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I am not sure, whether I hav=\r\ne right to address you as Narsimha Guruji or not ? I donot know whether i h=\r\nave the eligibility to become your Shishya also.  Still, i respect you as m=\r\ny Guruji and i am blessed to have found you. I should thank my friend, utpa=\r\nl for this.. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I need your help. Professionally i work for privat=\r\ne company in accounts and administration department since past 20 years. Be=\r\nsides my profession, i am script writer also.. To earn more money, to lead =\r\ngood standard of life and to pay back my home loans, i have started writing=\r\n script for Television serial as a part time job. I am doing this script wr=\r\niting work since past 4-5 years. Considering my creative talents and good l=\r\nanguage control (not praising myself)I am getting good assignments of writi=\r\nng TV serials.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; All daily soap television serials are glorifying =\r\nmore negativity, jeoulsy, conspiracy.. enemities.. Sometimes i am feeling g=\r\nuilty of writing scenes which shows  Conflicts between SAAS and BAHU, Confl=\r\nicts between FATHER and SON, Conflicts between BROTHER and BROTHER. I am co=\r\nmpelled to write harsh dialogues which hurts me sometimes.. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; The=\r\n formula on which TV serials are now based follow this: &quot;More conflicts mea=\r\nns more drama and more drama means more TRP(Television rating points)and Mo=\r\nre TRP means more benefits, more money and popularity to the serial&quot;.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Guruji, I feel that i am doing wrong by writing serials.. I am passin=\r\ng wrong messages to the society.. i feel guilty about it. I am not in a pos=\r\nition to leave this as it gives me more money besides it also gives me good=\r\n standard of life and good recognition also.. If i would leave this someone=\r\n else would do it.. What should i do? I am really confused. If i will leave=\r\n writing this, i will find more difficult to survive in this world with hom=\r\ne loan and two small school going children..I need your help\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I w=\r\nas fortunate to discuss this with utpal. He guided me to write this mail to=\r\n you.. to seek your guidance..\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Waiting anxiously your reply.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Respectful regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Rajesh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
