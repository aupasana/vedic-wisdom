Thought=\r\n of sharing it here.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; REMINISCENCES OF SWAMI VIVEKANANDA \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n BEFORE I knew Swamiji personally, I had heard much about\n&gt; his greatness f=\r\nrom persons who had moved and lived with him\n&gt; on the closest terms of inti=\r\nmacy. Therefore, when it was\n&gt; announced in the year 1893 that he had gone =\r\nover to America\n&gt; to represent our religion at the Chicago Parliament of\n&gt; =\r\nReligions, I started following his movements with the closest\n&gt; attention a=\r\nnd the greatest interest. I was anxiously waiting to\n&gt; see if his achieveme=\r\nnts would not confirm me in my very high\n&gt; estimate of him. I need not tell=\r\n you, people of Madras, that\n&gt; every bit of my expectation was much more th=\r\nan satisfied. But\n&gt; till I saw him with my own eyes, the perfect satisfacti=\r\non of\n&gt; knowing the man could not come. Till then I could not be\n&gt; quite fr=\r\nee from the secret misgivings that I might be after all\n&gt; labouring under a=\r\n delusion. So you see, gentlemen, that I did\n&gt; not meet Swamiji as one in a=\r\nny way biased against him. The\n&gt; throbbing interest and convincingness whic=\r\nh attach to the\n&gt; glowing description of the conquest of opponents of a gre=\r\nat\n&gt; man of overmastering personality does not belong to my\n&gt; subject. I ma=\r\ny say, I was already a great admirer of his. But I\n&gt; must say at the same t=\r\nime that it was not too late in the day to\n&gt; retrace my steps and give Swam=\r\niji up as one unworthy of my\n&gt; love and esteem if facts were found to give =\r\nthe lie. Perhaps,\n&gt; the shock which such a disclosure would have given to m=\r\ny\n&gt; mind would be too painful; perhaps it would have cost a great\n&gt; drenchi=\r\nng of the heart. But I can assure you that the instinct of\n&gt; moral self-pre=\r\nservation was yet stronger than my admiration\n&gt; of Swamiji, and cost how mu=\r\nch it would, the heart could not\n&gt; long cling round him if reason and moral=\r\n sense condemned\n&gt; him with one voice.\n&gt; And what was the nature of the gre=\r\natness I was expecting to\n&gt; see in Swamiji? It was not the dashing and dari=\r\nng spirit\n&gt; displayed by a heroic warrior on the battlefield, nor the fine =\r\nethereal vision and ecstasy of the poet, nor the vast erudition\n&gt; of a scho=\r\nlar, nor the dazzling intellectual flourish of the master\n&gt; controversialis=\r\nt, nor the quick penetration and the wide\n&gt; comprehension of the philosophe=\r\nr, nor the weeping heart of a true\n&gt; lover of humanity. It was not that I h=\r\nad not had enough\n&gt; testimony as to these qualities of head and heart being=\r\n\n&gt; abundantly present in him, but because my conception of religion\n&gt; was n=\r\not wide enough to include all these under it. His\n&gt; marvellous achievements=\r\n in the West were bringing us\n&gt; overwhelming evidences of his wonderful int=\r\nellectual powers. But\n&gt; either from some constitutional necessity or my ext=\r\nreme\n&gt; poverty in that direction I was always attributing the brightness of=\r\n\n&gt; his intellect to his highly elevated religious life, and it was this\n&gt; r=\r\neligious life that I expected to see in him. My idea of religion\n&gt; was then=\r\n confined to purity and meditation. Sitting at the feet\n&gt; of the holy and g=\r\nood disciples of Bhagavan Shri Ramakrishna,\n&gt; I had learnt that these two w=\r\nere the indispensable conditions\n&gt; of acquiring spirituality and are the su=\r\nre marks by which a\n&gt; religious man can always be known. My debt of gratitu=\r\nde to\n&gt; the blessed Swamis, at whose feet I had learnt these great\n&gt; lesson=\r\ns, is too large to be repaid. Personal contact with\n&gt; Swamiji instead of di=\r\nminishing the value of purity and\n&gt; meditation in my eyes, has only enhance=\r\nd it. At the same time it has\n&gt; heightened and intensified my conception of=\r\n religion by\n&gt; adding new elements to it. Till I came in personal contact w=\r\nith\n&gt; Swamiji my temperament had led me to expect to see in him a\n&gt; man of =\r\nintense purity and meditative inwardness. And I need\n&gt; not tell you that I =\r\nwas not disappointed. The First sight of\n&gt; Swamiji, the peculiar brightness=\r\n of his face, his lustrous yet\n&gt; soft and sweet eyes, at once carried into =\r\nmy heart an\n&gt; overwhelming sense of satisfaction that I had come to a man t=\r\nhat\n&gt; like of whom I had never seen before. Then when he began to\n&gt; talk to=\r\n us making personal inquiries and giving us words of\n&gt; hope and encourageme=\r\nnt with the cordiality of one truly\n&gt; interested in our welfare, we felt th=\r\nat our hearts were being\n&gt; drawn closer to him. To us who were very insigni=\r\nficant\n&gt; compared with his friends and visitors who were standing or sittin=\r\ng ground him in large numbers, this kindness on his part filed us\n&gt; with gr=\r\neat joy and gratitude. Then the wonderfully free and\n&gt; frank way in which h=\r\ne was talking to his visitors revealed to us\n&gt; a heart that knew nothing of=\r\n guile or fear nor cared a bit for\n&gt; social conventionality. The transparen=\r\ntly clear and pointed\n&gt; words that were shooting out of his lips like meteo=\r\nrs gave us a\n&gt; peep into the keen penetration of his intellect and the brea=\r\ndth\n&gt; and profundity of his mental vision. We felt ourselves in the\n&gt; prese=\r\nnce of an overpowering personality whose immensity it\n&gt; was not possible fo=\r\nr us to gauge, but which was drawing us to\n&gt; itself as by a tie of close pe=\r\nrsonal relationship. There arose on\n&gt; the first day of our meeting an excel=\r\nlent opportunity of\n&gt; knowing something of his real humility. I say real hu=\r\nmility because\n&gt; it had nothing to do with that sense of self-abasement wit=\r\nh its\n&gt; external manifestation of facial contortions which so often\n&gt; pass =\r\nfor humility. It was self-effacement and was not therefore\n&gt; without the ch=\r\narming dignity of self-respect. A question from\n&gt; one of the visitors as to=\r\n why Swamiji&#39;s lecture on his Master\n&gt; delivered in America had not seen th=\r\ne light of day, brought\n&gt; the bold confession: &quot;I did not allow it to be pu=\r\nblished as I had\n&gt; done injustice to my Master. My Master never condemned\n&gt;=\r\n anything or anybody. But while I was speaking of him I\n&gt; criticized the pe=\r\nople of America for their dollar-worshipping\n&gt; spirit. That day I learnt th=\r\ne lesson that I am not yet fit to talk of\n&gt; him.&quot; These words were really s=\r\ntartling to us for more than\n&gt; one reason. Here was a man who was being ido=\r\nlized, nay\n&gt; actually worshipped by so many, and this man in their very\n&gt; p=\r\nresence confessing his inability to represent his guru! &quot;What\n&gt; an unpreten=\r\ntious man is before us&quot;, said we to ourselves.\n&gt; &quot;What a wonderful man must=\r\n his guru have been to occupy\n&gt; such a high place in the heart of this grea=\r\nt man!&quot;\n&gt; This, in short, was my impression of Swamiji on the first day\n&gt; o=\r\nf our meeting. As days went and I knew more and more of\n&gt; him, it gained gr=\r\neater and greater strength. I only saw on the\n&gt; first day the few sparks th=\r\nat shot forth into our range of vision\n&gt; from a soul aglow with the fire of=\r\n divine love and wisdom. It\n&gt; was yet in store for me to see many more spar=\r\nks from the same source that drew me near to it, gave me a closer view of i=\r\nt, and\n&gt; enabled even my icy cold heart to possess a little of its warmth.\n=\r\n&gt; I have already told you that I had always thought that\n&gt; Swamiji&#39;s gigant=\r\nic intellect was the result of his highly elevated life of\n&gt; purity. Greate=\r\nr acquaintance with him was making my belief\n&gt; stronger till one day his ow=\r\nn words made it a settled conviction\n&gt; with me. It was a memorable evening =\r\nin my life, which shall\n&gt; never be effaced from my mind, when a question fr=\r\nom one of\n&gt; his would-be disciples brought forth an exhaustive and stirring=\r\n\n&gt; discourse on brahmacharya or sexual purity. In the course of\n&gt; the disco=\r\nurse he was explaining to us the incalculable value of\n&gt; purity in religiou=\r\ns life, how to practise it, how religious\n&gt; fervour, suddenly aroused by wo=\r\nrking on the emotional side of\n&gt; man to the utter neglect of the moral and =\r\nintellectual, is apt to\n&gt; produce great reaction on the sexual desires and =\r\nso forth.\n&gt; Then at last when he came to talk of the infinite powers of\n&gt; s=\r\ntrict sexual purity and how the animal propensity is converted\n&gt; into spiri=\r\ntual might, he warmed up to such a high pitch of\n&gt; earnestness that it seem=\r\ned as if the transparent soul within was\n&gt; flowing out in torrents through =\r\nhis lips, bathing its hearers\n&gt; with its heavenly waters. The picture that =\r\nwas being drawn by\n&gt; his words in our minds saw its own prototype in the fi=\r\ngure that\n&gt; stood before us. And I leave it to you, gentlemen, to imagine\n&gt;=\r\n the effect of these concluding words of the discourse upon us:\n&gt; &quot;My Maste=\r\nr had told me that if I could attain to the perfect\n&gt; state of purity I had=\r\n just described. I will have spiritual insight.\n&gt; I ventured to stand befor=\r\ne the world only when I had been\n&gt; satisfied that I had attained to it. I e=\r\narnestly appeal to you, my\n&gt; boys, to keep to this ideal with adamantine fi=\r\nrmness. Pray, do\n&gt; not be unworthy of me. &quot;On another occasion too I heard =\r\nhim\n&gt; speak of his spiritual insight which could at once see the end of\n&gt; a=\r\n thing hidden in the womb of futurity, of which the beginning\n&gt; is only mad=\r\ne. I must not be understood to mean that\n&gt; intellectual brightness is alway=\r\ns a sign of spirituality. A man may have\n&gt; a great intellect without being =\r\nin the least spiritual. On the\n&gt; other hand a man may be spiritual without =\r\nhaving his mind\n&gt; stored with informations, vast and varied, or without the=\r\n power to put his words in a logical form. But truth will always\n&gt; be his a=\r\nnd will flash upon his mind of itself. My present idea of\n&gt; Swamiji&#39;s intel=\r\nlect has undergone some modification from\n&gt; what it was before I knew him p=\r\nersonally. He combined in him\n&gt; spiritual insight with an intellect of the =\r\nhighest order. Truth\n&gt; came to him by intuition. But he would press his int=\r\nellect into\n&gt; its service by giving it a logical form and making it convinc=\r\ning\n&gt; by a rich supply of facts and analogies stored in his brain.\n&gt; And th=\r\ne purity which gave Swamiji this spiritual insight was\n&gt; something extraord=\r\ninary. It was not the fragile purity that can\n&gt; protect itself by keeping i=\r\ntself away from all corrupting\n&gt; influences. It had long outgrown the need =\r\nof the citadel of\n&gt; isolation. But that was not all. It became aggressive, =\r\ntaking a sort\n&gt; of delight in encountering its enemies on their own grounds=\r\n\n&gt; and winning them over to its side. In other words, it could not\n&gt; only k=\r\neep itself untouched amidst corrupting influences, but\n&gt; could turn them in=\r\nto positive powers for good. Gentlemen, I\n&gt; cannot go into personal details=\r\n on a subject like this. But my\n&gt; knowledge of Swamiji&#39;s marvellous achieve=\r\nments in this\n&gt; direction compels me to lay at his feet my deepest reverenc=\r\ne;\n&gt; this one element of perfection in Swamiji would have been\n&gt; quite enou=\r\ngh to compel me to give him the highest place in my\n&gt; heart.\n&gt; ...There was=\r\n one more prominent feature of Swamiji&#39;s life\n&gt; which speaks to me volumes =\r\nabout his renunciation. I mean\n&gt; his dealing with rich men. Many of you are=\r\n aware that among\n&gt; his foreign disciples some are very wealthy and a few o=\r\nf them\n&gt; came out to India to help Swamiji in his work. The treatment\n&gt; whi=\r\nch he used to give them did not in the least differ from that\n&gt; given to hi=\r\ns most insignificant Indian disciples. He was kind\n&gt; and loving by nature t=\r\no all, but his love did not make him blind\n&gt; to their flaws and defects whi=\r\nch needed mending.\n&gt; Gentle speech would not always serve the purpose, and\n=\r\n&gt; Swamiji would have to be at times hard. And in this\n&gt; apparently unpleasa=\r\nnt treatment, his wealthy disciples would have\n&gt; exactly the same fate as h=\r\nis begging sannyasins. At times, this\n&gt; would be too much for persons born =\r\nand brought up in the lap of luxury and accustomed to hear words of praise =\r\nand flattery\n&gt; From a worldly point of view, Swamiji paid dear for it. But =\r\ndid\n&gt; he ever regret? Far from it. The perfect unconcern which he\n&gt; showed =\r\nwhether rich people would stick to him or give him up\n&gt; is truly unpreceden=\r\nted.\n&gt; ...Of the few pregnant proverbs and epigrammatical\n&gt; expressions whi=\r\nch Swamiji would never be tired of repeating,\n&gt; one was &quot;  =E2=80&quot; The give=\r\nr of the head is alone the\n&gt; leader&quot;, that is, he atone can be a leader who=\r\n is ready to die for\n&gt; others. And Swamiji&#39;s own life determines his place =\r\namong his\n&gt; fellow beings. I have already told you that Swamiji was not\n&gt; o=\r\nnly kind and soft but was very hard also at times. He could\n&gt; not only lay =\r\ndown his life for others, but could take arms\n&gt; against others if needed. W=\r\nhatever he would think or feel he\n&gt; would do so with wonderful vehemence an=\r\nd intensity. And\n&gt; this whole-souledness was another marked feature of\n&gt; Sw=\r\namiji&#39;s life. One evening in the course of a talk that Swamiji was\n&gt; giving=\r\n to one of his disciples, opening his eyes to the fact that\n&gt; the disciple&#39;=\r\ns inability to manage the servants of the Math\n&gt; (which was one of his duti=\r\nes then) and make them do their\n&gt; respective duties was a weakness and did =\r\nnot proceed from\n&gt; love, he said, &quot;Don&#39;t think that your heart is full of l=\r\nove,\n&gt; because you cannot give them a little scolding now and then.\n&gt; Can y=\r\nou give your life for them? I know, you can&#39;t, because\n&gt; you do not love th=\r\nem. This minute I can die for them; but also\n&gt; I can hang them on this tree=\r\n this minute if need be. Can you do\n&gt; that? No, my boy, namby-pamby is not =\r\nlove. Remember the\n&gt; words of the poet,  =E2=80&quot;&#39;Harder than the thunderbol=\r\nt and softer than the flower&#39;, this is the ideal,\n&gt; No, love is not weak se=\r\nntimentality.&quot;\n&gt; I have seen no man who could be so soft as Swamiji. The\n&gt; =\r\ndeath of a gurubhai or a disciple would rob him of rest and\n&gt; consolation f=\r\nor days and days together. Some time in the year\n&gt; 1898, it pleased the Lor=\r\nd to take away one of his gurubhais.\n&gt; The pang of bereavement was so inten=\r\nse in Swamiji that for\n&gt; week he remained exceedingly heavy and absent-mind=\r\ned\n&gt; keeping as much away from others as possible. On the evening of the se=\r\nventh or eighth day he came to the temple-room of the\n&gt; Math, and began to =\r\ntalk to those that were present there, like\n&gt; a simple child: &quot;I did not co=\r\nme to the temple these days\n&gt; because I was very angry with my Master for h=\r\naving deprived\n&gt; me of my dear brother. I love them so much because I have\n=\r\n&gt; lived longer and more intimately with them than even with my\n&gt; own brothe=\r\nrs.... But why should I be angry with my Master?\n&gt; Why should I expect that=\r\n all things will be ordained according\n&gt; to my wishes? And why should I be =\r\nsad at all? Am I not a\n&gt; hero? My Master used to say laying his arm upon my=\r\n shoulder:\n&gt; Naren, you are a hero; the very sight of you inspires me with\n=\r\n&gt; courage.&#39; Yes, I am a hero. Why should I then give way to\n&gt; grief?&quot;\n&gt; ...=\r\nAsk each one of his disciples, American or English,\n&gt; Bengali or Madrasi, a=\r\nnd you will hear the same thing from all\n&gt; that their hearts were won by Sw=\r\namiji&#39;s wonderful love and\n&gt; sympathy. Swamiji&#39;s marvellous intellectual po=\r\nwers, no\n&gt; doubt, evoked the awe of all. But this awe would have kept at\n&gt; =\r\na distance all unintellectual people like myself and would have\n&gt; proved mo=\r\nre a barrier than a help to them to come in direct\n&gt; touch with him and dri=\r\nnk from the fountain of his soul. Heaps\n&gt; of instances could be cited to sh=\r\now Swamiji&#39;s wonderful heart.\n&gt; ...And how can universal love be without th=\r\ne ever present\n&gt; consciousness of the closest kinship with the universe, wi=\r\nthout\n&gt; the realization that whatever is is mine, nay, whatever is is\n&gt; me?=\r\n And this is brahmajnana (knowledge of Self) as our holy\n&gt; books describe i=\r\nt. This is the very core of Swamiji&#39;s teaching =E2=80&quot;\n&gt; The Selfhood of al=\r\nl =E2=80&quot; the Divinity of man. And this is, I am\n&gt; fully convinced, the key=\r\n to his wonderfully versatile nature.\n&gt; He was a lover of all, because he w=\r\nas a jnani. And here I must\n&gt; tell you that the fatal illusion under which =\r\nI had long laboured\n&gt; that jnana and bhakti are destructive of each other, =\r\ndispersed\n&gt; in the presence of Swamiji as darkness before the sun. Swamiji\n=\r\n&gt; was a tremendous worker because he was a bhakta and jnani.\n&gt; The tremendo=\r\nus energy that shook the whole world and is still\n&gt; at work awakening many =\r\na slumbering soul to its innate Divinity,\n&gt; instilling life into dead bones=\r\n, bringing sunshine in the darkness of despair and love in dry, arid souls =\r\n=E2=80&quot;, this\n&gt; tremendous energy owes its origin to his realization of bra=\r\nhman in all.\n&gt; Here too, I must tell you that the fatally-erroneous idea th=\r\nat karma is antagonistic to jnana and bhakti is dispelled at once\n&gt; by the =\r\nlife of Swamiji.\n&gt; I told you at the outset that before I met Swamiji I did=\r\n not,\n&gt; on account of my limited religious views, expect to see in him\n&gt; an=\r\nything of the warrior, the poet, the philosopher, or the\n&gt; philanthropist. =\r\nBut I found that he was all these and more than\n&gt; these. He was as much a p=\r\noet as a philosopher; as much a\n&gt; sentimental visionary as a man of action.=\r\n And he was all these,\n&gt; not in spite of his religion but on account of it.=\r\n\n&gt; I have learnt that a religion which does not call forth into\n&gt; vigorous =\r\nactivity and chasten and elevate the moral,\n&gt; intellectual, and aesthetic f=\r\naculties of man, make him humane and\n&gt; self-sacrificing and at the same lim=\r\ne self-absorbed and\n&gt; meditative is an imperfect religion. But I have also =\r\nlearnt that even\n&gt; such imperfect religions have their great purpose to ser=\r\nve in\n&gt; helping the growth of persons less evolved and that our\n&gt; attitude =\r\ntowards them all should he one of extreme sympathy and\n&gt; love. I have learn=\r\nt that I should hesitate thrice before I\n&gt; condemn any form of religious fa=\r\nith, however repellent it may\n&gt; appear to me. For I have seen forms of wors=\r\nhip, generally\n&gt; condemned as superstitious, yield treasurers of infinite b=\r\neauty\n&gt; and holiness touched by the magic wand of Swamiji. I have\n&gt; learnt =\r\nthat every individual, however degraded he may appear\n&gt; in my eyes, is God =\r\ninvolved, and therefore cannot be lost for\n&gt; ever. We should look upon him =\r\nwith respect and if possible\n&gt; give him a lift Godward, not by condemning h=\r\nis perverted\n&gt; ideal and by cruelly tearing it away from his heart but by g=\r\nently\n&gt; replacing it by a true one suited to his temperament and\n&gt; culture.=\r\n I have learnt that under peculiar circumstances even\n&gt; hardness and cruelt=\r\ny become a virtue, stubborn resistance.\n&gt; and excellence, and that activity=\r\n is as much a help to spiritual\n&gt; growth as contemplative calmness. I have =\r\nlearnt that God can\n&gt; be enjoyed both within ourselves and outside of ourse=\r\nlves;\n&gt; within ourselves by effacing completely from our consciousness all =\r\nimpression of the world of senses and making me\n&gt; Spirit touch Spirit. Outs=\r\nide ourselves by seeing God in\n&gt; everything and pouring out our hearts unto=\r\n His feel in the shape of\n&gt; loving service. I have learnt the incalculable =\r\nvalue of great\n&gt; personalities in the scheme of individual, national, and\n&gt;=\r\n universal redemption. I have also learnt that I have learnt all these\n&gt; on=\r\nly intellectually and am yet far from getting them woven\n&gt; into my nature. =\r\nAnd all these I have learnt from the life of\n&gt; Swamiji. One thing more: My =\r\nconviction that Swamiji&#39;s\n&gt; spiritual realization was of the highest order =\r\ncame to me not only\n&gt; from his intense purity, fearlessness, love of truth,=\r\n and\n&gt; universal sympathy, but also from those subtler personal\n&gt; manifesta=\r\ntions described in our shastras. I have seen him weep like a\n&gt; child and be=\r\ncoming disconsolate at the name of God. I have\n&gt; seen him go into such deep=\r\n meditation that even the function\n&gt; of the lungs stopped. Last of all came=\r\n his own words to give the\n&gt; finishing touch to my conception of his spirit=\r\nual greatness....\n&gt; (Vedanta Kesari, January-February 1923)\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam manyantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; p=\r\naram bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
