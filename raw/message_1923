They just served different purposes (like the arrow and necklace made of =\r\nthe same 22 pure gold) and hence had different qualities.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nLike I said, earlier, Rama and Krishna are from the soul and mind principle=\r\ns of the cosmic being. Soul is not bothered about the duality and maya, but=\r\n mind is. Rama was not a miracle\n worker.
