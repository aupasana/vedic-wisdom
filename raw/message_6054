Can we do thi=\r\ns through homam? If yes please give a manual for Navagraha homam. Or better=\r\n if we can use Kuja/shani homam as a basic and make some changes in them. I=\r\nn this case, please tell the changes.\n\nOr can we give ahutis to Navagraha w=\r\nhile doing Krishna homam? if yes please give mantras to be used and how and=\r\n when we can do this\n\nI shall be thankful to you\n\nRegards\n\n\n\n\n"}}
