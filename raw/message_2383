God Himself is the highest goal of man;\nsee Him, enjoy Him. We =\r\ncan never conceive anything higher, because God is\nperfection. We cannot co=\r\nnceive of any higher enjoyment than that of love,\nbut this word love has di=\r\nfferent meanings. It does not mean the ordinary\nselfish love of the world; =\r\nit is blasphemy to call that love. The love for\nour children and our wives =\r\nis mere animal love; that love which is perfectly\nunselfish is the only lov=\r\ne, and that is of God. It is a very difficult thing\nto attain to.\n\nWe are p=\r\nassing through all these different loves =97 love of children, father,\nmoth=\r\ner, and so forth. We slowly exercise the faculty of love; but in the\nmajori=\r\nty of cases we never learn anything from it, we become bound to one\nstep, t=\r\no one person. In some cases men come out of this bondage. Men are\never runn=\r\ning after wives and wealth and fame in this world; sometimes they\nare hit v=\r\nery hard on the head, and they find out what this world really is.\n\nNo one =\r\nin this world can really love anything but God. Man finds out that\nhuman lo=\r\nve is all hollow. Men cannot love though they talk of it. The wife\nsays she=\r\n loves her husband and kisses him; but as soon as he dies, the first\nthing =\r\nshe thinks about is the bank account, and what she shall do the next\nday. T=\r\nhe husband loves the wife; but when she becomes sick and loses her\nbeauty, =\r\nor becomes haggard, or makes a mistake, he ceases to care for her.\nAll the =\r\nlove of the world is hypocrisy and hollowness.\n\nWe say that a wife loves he=\r\nr husband. She thinks that her whole soul is\nabsorbed in him: a baby comes =\r\nand half of it goes out to the baby, or more. She\nherself will feel that th=\r\ne same love of husband does not exist now. So with\nthe father. We always fi=\r\nnd that when more intense objects of love come to\nus, the previous love slo=\r\nwly vanishes. Children at school think that some of\ntheir schoolfellows are=\r\n the dearest beings that they have in life, or their\nfathers or mothers are=\r\n so; then comes the husband or wife, and immediately\nthe old feeling disapp=\r\nears, and the new love becomes uppermost.\n\nThe world presents to us manifol=\r\nd stages of love. We have first to clear the\nground. Upon our view of life =\r\nthe whole theory of love will rest. To think\nthat this world is the aim and=\r\n end of life is brutal and degenerating. Any\nman who starts in life with th=\r\nat idea degenerates himself He will never rise\nhigher, he will never catch =\r\nthis glimpse from behind, he will always be a\nslave to the senses. He will =\r\nstruggle for the dollar that will get him a few\ncakes to eat. Better die th=\r\nan live that life. Slaves of this world, slaves\nof the senses, let us rouse=\r\n ourselves; there is something higher than this\nsense-life. Do you think th=\r\nat man, the Infinite Spirit was born to be a\nslave to his eyes, his nose, a=\r\nnd his ears? There is an Infinite, Omniscient\nSpirit behind that can do eve=\r\nrything, break every bond; and that Spirit we\nare, and we get that power th=\r\nrough love.\n\nWhat is the use of writing a book either to prove or disprove =\r\nGod? What does\nit matter to most people whether there is a God or not ?The =\r\nmajority of men\nwork just like a machine with no thought of God and feeling=\r\n no need of Him.\nThen one day comes Death and says, &quot;Come.&quot; The man says, &quot;=\r\nWait a little, I\nwant a little more time. I want to see my son grow a littl=\r\ne bigger.&quot; But\nDeath says, &quot;Come at once.&quot; So it goes on. So goes poor John=\r\n. What shall we\nsay to poor John? He never found anything in which God was =\r\nthe highest;\nperhaps he was a pig in the past, and he is much better as a m=\r\nan. But there\nare some who get a little awakening.\n\nThere is a form of reli=\r\ngion which is fashionable. My friend has much\nfurniture in her parlour; it =\r\nis the fashion to have a Japanese vase, so she\nmust have one even if it cos=\r\nts a thousand dollars. In the same way she will\nhave a little religion and =\r\njoin a church. Bhakti is not for such. That is\nnot want. Want is that witho=\r\nut which we cannot live. We want breath, we want\nfood, we want clothes; wit=\r\nhout them we cannot live. When a man loves a woman\nin this world, there are=\r\n times when he feels that without her he cannot\nlive, although that is a mi=\r\nstake.\n\nWhen a husband dies, the wife thinks she cannot live without him; b=\r\nut she\nlives all the same. This is the secret of necessity: it is that with=\r\nout\nwhich we cannot live; either it must come to us or we die. When the tim=\r\ne\ncomes that we feel the same about God, or in other words, we want somethi=\r\nng\nbeyond this world, something above all material forces, then we may beco=\r\nme\nBhaktas. What are our little lives when for a moment the cloud passes aw=\r\nay,\nand we get one glimpse from beyond, and for that moment all these lower=\r\n\ndesires seem like a drop in the ocean? Then the soul grows, and feels the\n=\r\nwant of God, and must have Him.\n\nIt is a wellknown psychological phenomenon=\r\n. As the loving wife thinks of her\ndeparted husband, with the same love we =\r\nmust desire the Lord, and then we\nwill find God, and all books and the vari=\r\nous sciences would not be able to\nteach us anything. By reading books we be=\r\ncome parrots; no one becomes\nlearned by reading books. If a man reads but o=\r\nne word of love, he indeed\nbecomes learned. So we want first to get that de=\r\nsire.\n\nThere is a proverb in our language =97 If I want to be a hunter, I&#39;l=\r\nl hunt the\nrhinoceros; if I want to be a robber, I&#39;ll rob the king&#39;s treasu=\r\nry. What is\nthe use of robbing beggars or hunting ants? So if you want to l=\r\nove, love\nGod. Who cares for these things of the world?This world is utterl=\r\ny false;\nall the great teachers of the world found that out; there is no wa=\r\ny out of\nit but through God. He is the goal of our life; all ideas that the=\r\n world is\nthe goal of life are pernicious.\n\n-- \nOm Namo Bhagavate Sri Raman=\r\naya\nPrasanth Jalasutram\n\nLove And Love Alone\n\r\n--00163600d853684a820472581069\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=windows-1252\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family=\r\n:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;THE FIRST STEPS=\r\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;Volume 4, Addresses on Bhakti-=\r\nYoga&lt;/span&gt;=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;What can be a higher end than God?
