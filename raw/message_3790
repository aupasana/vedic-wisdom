This comes from millions of janmas and samskaras. =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; My spiritual father &quot;Vimalananda&quot; used to say in a slightly different=\r\n context that he believes in Sampradaha or incineration.\n&gt; I applied it to =\r\nthis as well and it works quite well. \n&gt; Two things are going to be useful,=\r\n \n&gt; 1. Continue your mantra during the act and it will act as a continuatio=\r\nn of your sadhana.\n&gt; 2. If your partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do n=\r\not be disheartened by failure initially. As time goes on, the thing in your=\r\n mind which thinks of sex is incinerated and slowly you find that a naked f=\r\nemale(or male as may be the case) body is like a landscape picture just lik=\r\ne any other picture made by Her of nature(like Niagara falls, or Angkor Wat=\r\n, you need not be disturbed by it, you can certainly feel that the picture =\r\nis very beautiful but you need not be aroused by it). In fact Striya Samast=\r\na Sakala jagatsu, tyaikiya.......\n&gt; Once this stage is reached then the min=\r\nd ceases to think of sex all the while.\n&gt; Yes you may still encounter it, b=\r\nut that is another story.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Manish\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;  \n&gt; On Thu, Feb 25, =\r\n2010 at 2:24 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

But, it is possible t=\r\nhat he also likes the book and starts enjoying the book along with you and =\r\nstops distracting you.\n&gt; \n&gt;   If meditation is like reading a book, weaknes=\r\ns for sex is like the friend and sexual thoughts that arise in the mind are=\r\n like the distractions caused by the friend, then aghora&#39;s sadhana I mentio=\r\nned is like getting the friend to read the book along with you.\n&gt; \n&gt;   Howe=\r\nver, as I said, there are no guarantees. This friend may get interested in =\r\nthe book and stop distracting you, or he may continue to distract you and m=\r\nake it worse by being right next to you through the reading.

The idea is that one=\r\n is not bound by Maayaa once one *fully* understands and appreciates it.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt;     Chandipath consists of symbolic stories of wars that the divine Moth=\r\ner fought, which explain how one can fight and overcome various weaknesses =\r\nthat typically bind one in Maayaa. Reciting these stories on a regular basi=\r\ns will promote the fighting spirit within one that fights these weaknesses.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;     There is nothing wrong in understanding Maayaa and trying to figh=\r\nt/overcome it at the same time. One aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa. On=\r\ne aspect of the Mother makes you experience good and bad in that Maayaa. On=\r\ne aspect of the Mother makes you understand Maayaa to overcome it. One aspe=\r\nct of the Mother makes you fight and overcome it. When one realizes Self at=\r\n the end, irrespective of the path taken, one finally sees that all these a=\r\nre aspects of a Single Mother who is also essentially true Self.\n&gt; \n&gt;     *=\r\n        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;     &gt; Also, I have started to read the Aghora serie=\r\ns books by Dr. Robert\n&gt;     &gt; Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings =\r\non the subject.\n&gt;     &gt; Perhaps I need to read more! \n&gt; \n&gt;     Aghora serie=\r\ns books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora is not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. It is=\r\n normal to have mixed feelings.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Ghora means terrible. Aghora means=\r\n &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true Aghora (a=\r\nghori) does not see anything as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as i=\r\nmpermanent manifestations of god and tries to focus the thinking of the min=\r\nd on what is permanent (god) always, instead of impermanent manifestations =\r\nof god.\n&gt; \n&gt;     When someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya h=\r\nai&quot; while carrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of=\r\n Lord Rama is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remi=\r\nnd oneself that life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the L=\r\nord is real. But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ul=\r\ntimate truth only when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposed=\r\nly great thing we have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t=\r\n we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises=\r\n are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on =\r\ntemporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and wan=\r\nt to get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that=\r\n seems beautiful and other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary =\r\nillusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illus=\r\nions&quot;? When someone attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or a=\r\nngry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are tempo=\r\nrary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary =\r\nillusions&quot;?&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt;     A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; al=\r\nways. His mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of=\r\n *dwelling* on them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad et=\r\nc and thinking about them with attraction/aversion) and tries to find and f=\r\nocus on what is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n&gt; \n&gt;     *        *=\r\n        *\n&gt; \n&gt;     Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an=\r\n illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both i=\r\nmpermenant illusions and the only permanent reality within them is the Self=\r\n, he questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual w=\r\nhere feces is eaten. But, please remember that eating feces is not the main=\r\n point. Perceiving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an im=\r\npermanent manifestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For =\r\nexample, eating feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s m=\r\nind is dwelling on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while ea=\r\nting it. A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be =\r\ndwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and =\r\nwill not feel any kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and =\r\nhe is eating Self.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions=\r\n really. He chants vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I=\r\n am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely b=\r\ne a ritual and not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his min=\r\nd may dwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a =\r\nbadly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from t=\r\nhe focus on the permanent (Self).\n&gt; \n&gt;     Thus, a vedantin and an aghora a=\r\nre telling themselves the same truth and trying to absorb that truth into e=\r\nvery thought and impulse. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme situa=\r\ntion where failure results in a very bad dual experience. That can in fact =\r\nwork as an incentive in forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a =\r\nperson who chants a Vedic verse that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Sel=\r\nf&quot; and eats tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to =\r\nabsorb the mind in Self while eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on =\r\nthe nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the =\r\nbig deal? On the other hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells=\r\n on the taste of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failu=\r\nre results in a very bad dual experience may act as an incentive in succeed=\r\ning quickly.\n&gt; \n&gt;     However, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomp=\r\nlished by everyone merely because of an incentive. Not everyone trying Agho=\r\nra sadhanas succeeds.\n&gt; \n&gt;     *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;     Take another si=\r\nmple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam and hom=\r\nam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on se=\r\nx or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and that is causing g=\r\nuilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt;     A regular person will try to enfo=\r\nrce celibacy and keep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a=\r\n formula for overcoming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still c=\r\nome and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no =\r\nguarantee that the fascination in the mind does not return to bite one afte=\r\nr that. But, how to overcome the fascination some minds may have for sex?\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;     An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to fix the root c=\r\nause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping sadhana and s=\r\nex as two different activities (one pure and the other impure), he may comb=\r\nine them into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an a=\r\nghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and then does hi=\r\ns japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in sex. He may thi=\r\nnk that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do ja=\r\npam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogramme=\r\nd. He may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no longe=\r\nr feel titillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex m=\r\nay be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no long=\r\ner evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small thoug=\r\nhts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to denser an=\r\nd denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, but they may =\r\nnow take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much time in medita=\r\ntion while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thrill mind may fee=\r\nl for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the person&#39;s fasci=\r\nnation and weakness for sex may be gone largely.\n&gt; \n&gt;     Mind has a lot of=\r\n conditioning based on prior experiences and the thoughts we are exposed to=\r\n. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of these structures by engaging=\r\n in certain practices that undermine those structures.\n&gt; \n&gt;     However, is=\r\n this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also possible that the person =\r\nkeeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and thinks of sex everytim=\r\ne he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he se=\r\nes naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ready to start with.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n     *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;     Bottomline is that an aghora takes proble=\r\nms and weaknesses head on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, wherea=\r\ns a normal person may push the problems under the carpet and fight slowly a=\r\nnd with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is not applicable to all.\n&gt; \n&gt;   =\r\n  *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt;     Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is=\r\n Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to understan=\r\nd and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stakes =\r\nwar plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may feel a=\r\nversion. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it based on =\r\na wrong understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings. Aghora s=\r\ntands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract some peop=\r\nle pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora and Vedan=\r\nta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how one absorbs=\r\n the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasant.\n&gt; \n&gt;     =\r\nBTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual paths an=\r\nd explains the basic reality.

But what I am trying to understand is that ho=\r\nw to worship both forms simultaneously. For instance, Sri Muththuswamy Disk=\r\nshitar, was a great composer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic Music a=\r\nlong with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sri Vidyop=\r\nasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis mention great details about all the =\r\nnine avaranas and different forms of the divine mother as one goes through =\r\neach avarana. In the Dhyana Krithi of those, in the very first line he says=\r\n, &#39;Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;. That line tells me that even =\r\nthrough Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, in that form. \n&gt; \n&gt;           =\r\n  So my question was in that perspective. Anyway, your reply was a great on=\r\ne in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by layers of duality! I=\r\n never thought in those terms. \n&gt; \n&gt;             I have started reading Dur=\r\nga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it fluently, before I start =\r\nto do chandi homam, which I plan to do during navaratri of 2010. I really c=\r\nannot wait to get comfortable reading the saptashati! Have to see how mothe=\r\nr will help me achieve my target. \n&gt; \n&gt;             Also, I have started to=\r\n read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert Svobodha. For now I have very m=\r\nixed feelings on the subject. Perhaps I need to read more! \n&gt; \n&gt;           =\r\n  Nagraj\n&gt; \n&gt;             --- On Fri, 2/12/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;               From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;       =\r\n        Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya\n&gt;           =\r\n    To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt;               Date: Friday, February=\r\n 12, 2010, 11:31 PM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;                 \n&gt;               Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n              Sanskrit is almost like a mother tongue to me. My performing =\r\na Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspiring. On the other hand, =\r\nthere are some people who do not know Sanskrit at all and took 4 hours to r=\r\nead Chandipath with great difficulty in their first attempt. THEY are doing=\r\n Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-inspiri=\r\nng.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Integrating various sadhanas is a personal problem t=\r\nhat needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea to pick one or=\r\n two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead of splitting the=\r\n time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better to =\r\ndig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten places, if one =\r\nwants to find water.\n&gt; \n&gt;               One possibility is to do a homam an=\r\nd then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is at=\r\ntached to.\n&gt; \n&gt;               I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. =\r\nHowever, from the little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic r=\r\nepresentation of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, =\r\nis to unravel the layer of duality and realize Self.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Lal=\r\nita means gentle one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother =\r\nwho teaches you gently, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is =\r\nstern and strict, you will learn fast (provided you can face the strictness=\r\n). Both are valid paths.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Best regards,\n&gt;               N=\r\narasimha\n&gt;               ------------ --------- --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- -\n&gt;               Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons,=\r\n Jyotish Writings,\n&gt;               &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for shor=\r\nt Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;               http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n=\r\n&gt;               Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n&gt; =\r\n              Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt;=\r\n               Jyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri=\r\n tings\n&gt;               ------------ --------- --------- --------- ---------=\r\n --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt;               --- On Fri, 2/5/10, nagraj@sbcglobal. net &lt;=\r\nnagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;               From: nagraj@sbcglobal. net=\r\n &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;\n&gt;               Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Chandi Homa=\r\nm and Sri Vidya\n&gt;               To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt;       =\r\n        Date: Friday, February 5, 2010, 11:51 PM\n&gt; \n&gt;               Dear Sr=\r\ni Narasimharao garu,\n&gt; \n&gt;               I am very much in awe after I learn=\r\nt that you do chandi homam everyday. You also wrote that it takes about 1.2=\r\n5 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How can you accomplish that f=\r\neat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? Also, in my case, I do sandhyavan=\r\ndanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 min=\r\nutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10=\r\n minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. Plus I sometimes=\r\n do special rituals several times a week, that takes about 1 to 1.5 hours i=\r\nn all. How to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyopasana differen=\r\nt from Chandi homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vidya and how it =\r\nis to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi Mahatmayam is a=\r\nll about but I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musicia=\r\nn also and learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami Dikshit=\r\nar recently.\n&gt; \n&gt;               Nagraj Kota\n&gt; \n&gt;            \n&gt;       .\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
