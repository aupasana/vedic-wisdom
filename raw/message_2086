It is either this or that.\n&gt;\n&gt; Both are correct, but at differen=\r\nt levels. I will elaborate. However,\nthis is philosophically complex and th=\r\nose who do not follow what I say\nshould not worry at all.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Non=\r\n-dual self has no division of self into various objects or space or\ntime. T=\r\nhere is no concept of time or space or space-time continuum\nwithin non-dual=\r\n self. A yogi absorbed in non-dual self has no sense of\nspace or time or ob=\r\njectification.\n&gt;\n&gt; Supreme cosmic being is the link between duality and non=\r\n-duality.\nSupreme cosmic being arising in this non-dual self captures the e=\r\nntire\nfield of duality within Him. All beings, entire space and all space-t=\r\nime\ncontinua within the field of duality exist within Him. From the\nperspec=\r\ntive of supreme cosmic being, all beings of the dual world are\nHis parts an=\r\nd all their individual wills are parts of His cosmic will.\nAs all space-tim=\r\ne continua are within Him, there is nothing that is\nunknown to Him. Past, p=\r\nresent and future; here, there and everywhere; I,\nyou and others, this poss=\r\nibility, that possibility and yet another\npossibility - all are accessible =\r\nand fully &quot;known&quot; to His\nself-awareness.\n&gt;\n&gt; Now, let us come lower and int=\r\no the field of duality. The field of\nduality consists of infinite divisions=\r\n of space, time and space-time\ncontinua. There are infinite possibilities w=\r\nithin this field.\n&gt;\n&gt; Normally, people stuck deeply within duality have a l=\r\ninear sense of\ntime and perceive just a part of one space-time continuum. H=\r\nowever,\nfield of duality also contains planes of consciousness where differ=\r\nent\nsenses of time and different space-time continua (that may intersect at=\r\n\nvarious points) exist. A yogi who experiences such a space-time\ncontinuum =\r\nin such a plane of consciousness may experience a point of\ntime that maps t=\r\no a future time in a regular space-time continuum being\nexperienced by you.=\r\n Also, what is 1 minute in one space-time continuum\nmay be 1 year in anothe=\r\nr space-time continuum. Time is not as\nstraight-forward an entity as one ma=\r\ny think. Basically, the field of\nduality contains infinite space-time conti=\r\nnua and what one experiences\ndepends on the plane of consciousness that one=\r\n&#39;s self-awareness\n(Kundalini) is in. But, most of us experience part of a s=\r\npecific\nspace-time continuum and hence think that that is the only reality.=\r\n But\nrelaity consists of infinite space-time continua that intersect each\no=\r\nther. These are all different possibilities and you chart out your\ncourse b=\r\nased on your actions and Nature&#39;s reactions to your actions.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nFrom the perspective of a yogi who is in a different space-time\ncontinuum, =\r\nyour state may be known at a time that is in &quot;future&quot; as per\nthe space-time=\r\n continuum in which you exist. But, from the perspective\nof the space-time =\r\ncontinuum that you are in, your state at that future\ntime is not yet known =\r\nand depends on your current action.\n&gt;\n&gt; If a yogi in a different space-time=\r\n continuum has seen your state in\nfuture, his observation is merely an obse=\r\nrvation and from his reference\nframe. It has no causal relationship to your=\r\n current action or your\nfuture state. He is merely an observer and he does =\r\nnot cause anything to\nhappen. His observation is specific to some space-tim=\r\ne pairs and does\nnot cover all the space-time pairs that you will traverse =\r\nas you travel\nto reach the space-time pair where he observed you (if at all=\r\n you do!).\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Let us go further. Is there only one future possib=\r\nle for you? Or, does\nthe path traversed by you in space-time continuum not =\r\nfixed but variable\nbased on your actions? Can your actions at important cro=\r\nss-roads alter\nthe course you traverse?\n&gt;\n&gt; If so, what is the meaning of a=\r\n yogi observing you at a space-time\npair? Is his observation only a possibi=\r\nlity or a certainty? One may say\n&quot;how can one observe a possibility? Anythi=\r\nng we observe must be a\ncertainty.&quot; But is that correct? Aren&#39;t the field o=\r\nf duality and the\ninfinite space-time continua contained in it merely a set=\r\n of infinite\npossibilities?\n&gt;\n&gt; Some great rishis can see not just a space-=\r\ntime pair, but many\nspace-time continua at the same time, i.e. they can see=\r\n various\npossibilities based on various possible actions. However, visions =\r\nseen\nby most yogis about &quot;future&quot; are just one possibility.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; B=\r\nottomline: At the level at which we exist, there is certainly\nsomething cal=\r\nled &quot;freewill&quot;. Within the limits imposed by the reactions\ngiven by nature =\r\nto your own previous actions, you do have a scope for\nengaging in different=\r\n actions at this time. Depending on which action\nyou engage in, the future =\r\ncan be slightly different. Some actions can\neven make the future significan=\r\ntly different. A rishi may be able to\nchart out a significant portion of th=\r\ne field of possibilities for future\n(e.g. like a brilliant chess player fig=\r\nuring out most possibilities upto\n20 moves from now). An advanced yogi may =\r\nbe able to see a few\npossibilities for future (e.g. like a good chess playe=\r\nr figuring out a\nfew moves or guessing a future position). But the supreme =\r\ncosmic being\nknows the entire field of possibilities, as they all exist wit=\r\nhin Him.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, your actions are what bring to fruition (w.r.t. the r=\r\neference\nframe of your consciousness!) some of those possibilities. One may=\r\n know\nall the possibilities quite deeply and even guess the possibility tha=\r\nt\nwill come to fruition, but it is your actions that actually make some of\n=\r\nthose possibilities a reality.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------=\r\n------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Y=\r\nourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself:=\r\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.hom=\r\ne.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer=\r\n.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; --=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- =\r\nOriginal Message -----\n&gt; From: rajarshi nandy\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroup=\r\ns.com\n&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 30, 2009 5:22 AM\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] =\r\nFreewill.\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasimhaji\n&gt;\n&gt; No doubt a wonderful and inspiring ma=\r\nil for all of us, however, I\ncould not help it that an inevitable question =\r\npopped up in my mind. One\nof the oft discussed and eternal questions.\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\nf events have already been created like in a movie and later as time\nunfold=\r\ns, they happen in our plane of existence, then all talk of\nfreewill must be=\r\n humbug? Like a placebo that makes us &quot;happy&quot; but in\nreality does not exist=\r\n!\n&gt;\n&gt; I am not questioning that what you wrote in the mail about events\nhav=\r\ning already happened, because same has been said by other great\nspiritual p=\r\neople in the world.\n&gt;\n&gt; But my question is because I cannot reconcile this =\r\nwith a freewill.\nBoth cannot be correct. It is either this or that.\n&gt;\n&gt; The=\r\noritically speaking, say tomorrow suddenly majority of the world\nreforms it=\r\nself, does a self correction exercise and brings in peace,\nharmony etc etc,=\r\n then why should the Kalki Avatar still incarnate? But\nthen if the Kalki Av=\r\natar has to incarnate - as our texts say - then such\na self correcting opti=\r\non is already negated out.\n&gt;\n&gt; Well, theoritically, in a very large viewpoi=\r\nnt no one has any choice\nin the sense that finally everyone will end up mer=\r\nging with the divine.\n&gt;\n&gt; So I guess freewill is not really as free as we l=\r\nove to think.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt; The upsurge (of consciousness) is=\r\n Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On Tue, 30/6/09, Narasimha PVR Rao pvr@... =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao pvr@...\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Miscel=\r\nlany: Future, bestest homam, purity and\novercoming ego\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Tuesday, 30 June, 2009, 6:01 AM\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt;\n&gt; I=\r\n mentioned an episode of a small boy who did a very short Chandi\nhomam and =\r\nsaw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnations above the fire in the following\nmail:\n&gt;\n&gt; htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message/ 761\n&gt;\n&gt; This boy was bo=\r\nrn and brought up in US and is not proficient in his\nknowledge of Hinduism.=\r\n He did not know much about some of the ten\nincarnations. He described what=\r\n he saw and I told him who was who and a\nlittle about them. One of the form=\r\ns he saw was a radiant man with white\nclothes riding a white horse on a dus=\r\nty road. I told him he was Kalki\nand he hadn&#39;t come yet.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; This=\r\n boy is usually playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was\nwith him o=\r\nne morning, I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was\nabou a week af=\r\nter the episode mentioned in the above mail.\n&gt;\n&gt; I asked what he was thinki=\r\nng. He said, &quot;it is not that the future that\nis to come has not already hap=\r\npened. It has already happened in reality,\nbut it will happen later when th=\r\ne time comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I\nguessed what he was getting at, but =\r\npretended not to know. I said, &quot;no.\nWhat do you mean?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He said, &quot;I don&#39;=\r\nt know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not\nknown to be overly i=\r\nntelligent or articulate. His main characteristic is\nthat he is usually che=\r\nerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and\nrelaxed. However, he was onto so=\r\nmething today. But he could not express\nhimself.\n&gt;\n&gt; I helped him, &quot;do you =\r\nmean to say that future has already happened at\nsome level, but will reveal=\r\n itself to people later? Kind of like a\nmovie. A movie may have been shot a=\r\nnd become ready in a studio. Some\npeople may have already seen it. But peop=\r\nle seeing it on the screen\nlater will think it is happening in front of the=\r\nm. Are you saying\nsomething like that?&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is=\r\n what I am saying. If something is\ngoing to happen in future, it will happe=\r\nn when future comes. But\nsomebody may be able to see it before future comes=\r\n, because it has\nalready happened.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; Though he did not mention it, I kne=\r\nw why he was thinking along these\nlines. When I told him the man riding the=\r\n horse in his vision over the\nfire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was=\r\n probably confused. Given\nhis age and ability to think and understand thing=\r\ns, this probably seemed\nlike an oddity to him that he should see somebody w=\r\nho had not yet come.\nSo he was trying to think how it was possible and came=\r\n to some important\nconclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.\n&gt;\n&gt; Time seems =\r\nlinear at the level of regular consciousness. However, in\nmany planes of co=\r\nnssciousness, the concept of time becomes changed. It\neven loses its meanin=\r\ng when one is established in non-dual Aatman or\nBrahman or Self.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n=\r\n&gt;\n&gt; The same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam with a small\nnaama=\r\n mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before name. When\nwe were=\r\n meditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and powerful\nenergy. I=\r\nt was quite different from the energy I feel normally. This\nintense energy =\r\nmade my mind feel satisfied and blissful and a feeling\nthat can be loosely =\r\nexpressed in words as &quot;I am done here. I have\nnothing more left to do. Time=\r\n to leave&quot; filled my entire consciousnss.\n&gt;\n&gt; I had experienced the same ki=\r\nnd of intense energy twice before that.\nOnce I experienced the same energy =\r\nwhen I was meditating sitting next to\nmy guru Manish who was doing a Chandi=\r\n homam in India. Second time was\nwhen I had an unexpected opportunity to me=\r\nditate inside the garbhaalaya\nof a famous temple, standing within 3 feet fr=\r\nom the main Kaali idol\nthere, which was sanctified and worshipped by a grea=\r\nt saint in the past.\nThe energy I felt was the same on all the three occasi=\r\nons. At no other\ntime did I feel that intense shakti.\n&gt;\n&gt; Interestingly, af=\r\nter we finished meditation and opened eyes, that boy\nremarked, &quot;out of all =\r\nthe different homas I did so far, this is the\nbestest homam.&quot; I asked him w=\r\nhy. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say it,\nbut it just felt awesome and diff=\r\nerent.&quot;\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; This boy performed a really simple and short procedur=\r\ne, shorter than\nwhat I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was successfu=\r\nl in making a\npowerful energy manifest there. The bottomline is that intern=\r\nal purity\nis the most important thing.\n&gt;\n&gt; Rituals help purify one and puri=\r\nty helps one do a ritual better and\nget more out of it. It is an egg and ch=\r\nicken problem and one has to keep\ndoing it until one breaks through.\n&gt;\n&gt; Ke=\r\nep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do pay attention\nto inte=\r\nrnal purity as you engage in external practices. The only\nworthwhile measur=\r\ne of spiritual progress and purity is how smaller your\nego becomes. As ego =\r\nbecomes smaller, you can resist attraction to\nexternal things better and yo=\r\nu can resist internal enemies like lust,\nanger, jealosy etc better. You can=\r\n do your dharma better. Ego - thinking\nthat this is &quot;I&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; =\r\n- is the root cause of all problems.\n&gt;\n&gt; * * *\n&gt;\n&gt; Overcoming ego using jna=\r\nana yoga is relatively challenging, but bhakti\nyoga is easier. Think that a=\r\nll that is around you - including your\nhouse, money, cars, spouse, children=\r\n and your own body - is god&#39;s\nproperty and that you are a temporary caretak=\r\ner of all of these\nproperties of god. Do the best job you can, but without =\r\nentertaining the\nnotion &quot;this is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good =\r\ncare of his\nmaster&#39;s properties, but without thinking of all those things a=\r\ns his or\nher belongings.\n&gt;\n&gt; Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is n=\r\not necessary for taking\ngood care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master=\r\n takes the best care\nof things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away=\r\n, a servant does\nnot waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept =\r\nthat is\nmaster&#39;s property and can be taken away anytime. This enables one t=\r\no do\nthe best job with what one possesses and not worry about what one does=\r\n\nnot possess or what is out of one&#39;s control.\n&gt;\n&gt; Developing the attitude o=\r\nf a servant who takes care of master&#39;s\nproperties will help one wade the oc=\r\nean of worldly life without getting\ncaught and overcome ego.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regar=\r\nds,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ----=\r\n----- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam=\r\n\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; S=\r\npirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish l=\r\nessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) web=\r\nsite: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; ------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- -\n&gt;\n\n\n\r\n--9-4649162184-2890734638=:1\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;P&gt;Namaste Narasimha garu,&lt;/P&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&gt;people stuck deeply within duality ha=\r\nve a linear sense of time and &gt;perceive just a part of one &gt;space-tim=\r\ne continuum.

There are infinite possibilities with=\r\nin this field.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Normally, people stuck deeply within dualit=\r\ny have a linear sense of time and perceive just a part of one space-time co=\r\nntinuum. However, field of duality also contains planes of consciousness wh=\r\nere different senses of time and different space-time continua (that may in=\r\ntersect at various points) exist. A yogi who experiences such a space-time =\r\ncontinuum in such a plane of consciousness may experience a point of time t=\r\nhat maps to a future time in a regular space-time continuum being experienc=\r\ned by you. Also, what is 1 minute in one space-time continuum may be 1 year=\r\n in another space-time continuum. Time is not as straight-forward an entity=\r\n as one may think. Basically, the field of duality contains infinite space-=\r\ntime continua and what one experiences depends on the plane of consciousnes=\r\ns that one&#39;s self-awareness (Kundalini) is in. But, most of us experience p=\r\nart of a specific space-time continuum and hence think that that is the onl=\r\ny reality. But relaity consists of infinite space-time continua that inters=\r\nect each other. These are all different possibilities and you chart out you=\r\nr course based on your actions and Nature&#39;s reactions to your actions.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From the perspective of a yogi who is i=\r\nn a different space-time continuum, your state may be known at a time that =\r\nis in &quot;future&quot; as per the space-time continuum in which you exist. But, fro=\r\nm the perspective of the space-time continuum that you are in, your state a=\r\nt that future time is not yet known and depends on your current action.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If a yogi in a different space-time continuum has seen your s=\r\ntate in future, his observation is merely an observation and from his refer=\r\nence frame. It has no causal relationship to your current action or your fu=\r\nture state. He is merely an observer and he does not cause anything to happ=\r\nen. His observation is specific to some space-time pairs and does not cover=\r\n all the space-time pairs that you will traverse as you travel to reach the=\r\n space-time pair where he observed you (if at all you do!).&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Let us go further. Is there only one future possib=\r\nle for you? Or, does the path traversed by you in space-time continuum not =\r\nfixed but variable based on your actions? Can your actions at important cro=\r\nss-roads alter the course you traverse?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If so, what is the=\r\n meaning of a yogi observing you at a space-time pair? Is his observation o=\r\nnly a possibility or a certainty? One may say &quot;how can one observe a possib=\r\nility? Anything we observe must be a certainty.&quot; But is that correct? Aren&#39;=\r\nt the field of duality and the infinite space-time continua contained in it=\r\n merely a set of infinite possibilities?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Some great rishis=\r\n can see not just a space-time pair, but many space-time continua at the sa=\r\nme time, i.e. they can see various possibilities based on various possible =\r\nactions. However, visions seen by most yogis about &quot;future&quot; are just one po=\r\nssibility.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Bottomline: At the level=\r\n at which we exist, there is certainly something called &quot;freewill&quot;. Within =\r\nthe limits imposed by the reactions given by nature to your own previous ac=\r\ntions, you do have a scope for engaging in different actions at this time. =\r\nDepending on which action you engage in, the future can be slightly differe=\r\nnt. Some actions can even make the future significantly different. A rishi =\r\nmay be able to chart out a significant portion of the field of possibilitie=\r\ns for future (e.g. like a brilliant chess player figuring out most possibil=\r\nities upto 20 moves from now). An advanced yogi may be able to see a few po=\r\nssibilities for future (e.g. like a good chess player figuring out a few mo=\r\nves or guessing a future position). But the supreme cosmic being knows the =\r\nentire field of possibilities, as they all exist within Him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; However, your actions are what bring to fruition (w.r.t. the reference f=\r\nrame of your consciousness!) some of those possibilities. One may know all =\r\nthe possibilities quite deeply and even guess the possibility that will com=\r\ne to fruition, but it is your actions that actually make some of those poss=\r\nibilities a reality.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; ------------------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyoti=\r\nsh lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish s=\r\noftware (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Cen=\r\ntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; --------------------=\r\n---------------------------------------------- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ----- Orig=\r\ninal Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: rajarshi nandy &lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@=\r\nyahoogroups.com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sent: Tuesday, June 30, 2009 5:22 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subje=\r\nct: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Freewill.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Narasimhaji&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; No doubt a wonderful and inspiring mail for all of us, however,=\r\n I could not help it that an inevitable question popped up in my mind. One =\r\nof the oft discussed and eternal questions.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; If events have=\r\n already been created like in a movie and later as time unfolds, they happe=\r\nn in our plane of existence, then all talk of freewill must be humbug? Like=\r\n a placebo that makes us &quot;happy&quot; but in reality does not exist!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; I am not questioning that what you wrote in the mail about events hav=\r\ning already happened, because same has been said by other great spiritual p=\r\neople in the world. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; But my question is because I cannot r=\r\neconcile this with a freewill. Both cannot be correct. It is either this or=\r\n that.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Theoritically speaking, say tomorrow suddenly major=\r\nity of the world reforms itself, does a self correction exercise and brings=\r\n in peace, harmony etc etc, then why should the Kalki Avatar still incarnat=\r\ne? But then if the Kalki Avatar has to incarnate - as our texts say - then =\r\nsuch a self correcting option is already negated out.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Well=\r\n, theoritically, in a very large viewpoint no one has any choice in the sen=\r\nse that finally everyone will end up merging with the divine.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; So I guess freewill is not really as free as we love to think.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The upsurge (of conscio=\r\nusness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Tue, 30/6/09, Nar=\r\nasimha PVR Rao pvr@... wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao pvr@=\r\n...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Miscellany: Future, bestest homam, puri=\r\nty and overcoming ego&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date=\r\n: Tuesday, 30 June, 2009, 6:01 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I mentioned an episode of a small boy who did a very short Chand=\r\ni homam and saw Vishnu&#39;s ten incarnations above the fire in the following m=\r\nail:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom/message=\r\n/ 761&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This boy was born and brought up in US and is not pr=\r\noficient in his knowledge of Hinduism. He did not know much about some of t=\r\nhe ten incarnations. He described what he saw and I told him who was who an=\r\nd a little about them. One of the forms he saw was a radiant man with white=\r\n clothes riding a white horse on a dusty road. I told him he was Kalki and =\r\nhe hadn&#39;t come yet.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This boy is usu=\r\nally playful, easy-going and smiling. But, when I was with him one morning,=\r\n I saw him lost in some serious thought. This was abou a week after the epi=\r\nsode mentioned in the above mail.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I asked what he was thin=\r\nking. He said, &quot;it is not that the future that is to come has not already h=\r\nappened. It has already happened in reality, but it will happen later when =\r\nthe time comes. You know what I mean?&quot; I guessed what he was getting at, bu=\r\nt pretended not to know. I said, &quot;no. What do you mean?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; H=\r\ne said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how to say what I am thinking.&quot; This boy is not known=\r\n to be overly intelligent or articulate. His main characteristic is that he=\r\n is usually cheerful, playful, sweet, kind, contented and relaxed. However,=\r\n he was onto something today. But he could not express himself.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; I helped him, &quot;do you mean to say that future has already happened at=\r\n some level, but will reveal itself to people later? Kind of like a movie. =\r\nA movie may have been shot and become ready in a studio. Some people may ha=\r\nve already seen it. But people seeing it on the screen later will think it =\r\nis happening in front of them. Are you saying something like that?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He exclaimed, &quot;exactly. That is what I am saying. If something is=\r\n going to happen in future, it will happen when future comes. But somebody =\r\nmay be able to see it before future comes, because it has already happened.=\r\n&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though he did not mention it, I knew why he was thinking=\r\n along these lines. When I told him the man riding the horse in his vision =\r\nover the fire was Kalki and he was yet to come, he was probably confused. G=\r\niven his age and ability to think and understand things, this probably seem=\r\ned like an oddity to him that he should see somebody who had not yet come. =\r\nSo he was trying to think how it was possible and came to some important co=\r\nnclusions about &quot;time&quot; in his own way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Time seems linear a=\r\nt the level of regular consciousness. However, in many planes of consscious=\r\nness, the concept of time becomes changed. It even loses its meaning when o=\r\nne is established in non-dual Aatman or Brahman or Self.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *=\r\n * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The same boy once performed a very short Kaali homam =\r\nwith a small naama mantra of Dakshina Kaali with beejaakshara added before =\r\nname. When we were meditating after poornaahuti, I felt a very intense and =\r\npowerful energy. It was quite different from the energy I feel normally. Th=\r\nis intense energy made my mind feel satisfied and blissful and a feeling th=\r\nat can be loosely expressed in words as &quot;I am done here. I have nothing mor=\r\ne left to do. Time to leave&quot; filled my entire consciousnss.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; I had experienced the same kind of intense energy twice before that. Once=\r\n I experienced the same energy when I was meditating sitting next to my gur=\r\nu Manish who was doing a Chandi homam in India. Second time was when I had =\r\nan unexpected opportunity to meditate inside the garbhaalaya of a famous te=\r\nmple, standing within 3 feet from the main Kaali idol there, which was sanc=\r\ntified and worshipped by a great saint in the past. The energy I felt was t=\r\nhe same on all the three occasions. At no other time did I feel that intens=\r\ne shakti.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Interestingly, after we finished meditation and =\r\nopened eyes, that boy remarked, &quot;out of all the different homas I did so fa=\r\nr, this is the bestest homam.&quot; I asked him why. He said, &quot;I don&#39;t know how =\r\nto say it, but it just felt awesome and different.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This boy performed a really simple and short procedure, sh=\r\norter than what I give in manuals. But it seemed like he was successful in =\r\nmaking a powerful energy manifest there. The bottomline is that internal pu=\r\nrity is the most important thing.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rituals help purify one =\r\nand purity helps one do a ritual better and get more out of it. It is an eg=\r\ng and chicken problem and one has to keep doing it until one breaks through=\r\n.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Keep performing your chosen spiritual practices, but do =\r\npay attention to internal purity as you engage in external practices. The o=\r\nnly worthwhile measure of spiritual progress and purity is how smaller your=\r\n ego becomes. As ego becomes smaller, you can resist attraction to external=\r\n things better and you can resist internal enemies like lust, anger, jealos=\r\ny etc better. You can do your dharma better. Ego - thinking that this is &quot;I=\r\n&quot; and this is &quot;mine&quot; - is the root cause of all problems.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n* * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Overcoming ego using jnaana yoga is relatively chall=\r\nenging, but bhakti yoga is easier. Think that all that is around you - incl=\r\nuding your house, money, cars, spouse, children and your own body - is god&#39;=\r\ns property and that you are a temporary caretaker of all of these propertie=\r\ns of god. Do the best job you can, but without entertaining the notion &quot;thi=\r\ns is mine&quot;. A faithful servant takes very good care of his master&#39;s propert=\r\nies, but without thinking of all those things as his or her belongings.&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Realize that thinking of things as &quot;mine&quot; is not necessary fo=\r\nr taking good care of them. A servant who loves one&#39;s master takes the best=\r\n care of things entrusted to one. When a thing is taken away, a servant doe=\r\ns not waste time worrying and crying. A servant will accept that is master&#39;=\r\ns property and can be taken away anytime. This enables one to do the best j=\r\nob with what one possesses and not worry about what one does not possess or=\r\n what is out of one&#39;s control.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Developing the attitude of =\r\na servant who takes care of master&#39;s properties will help one wade the ocea=\r\nn of worldly life without getting caught and overcome ego.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.=\r\ncom/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicas=\r\ntro. home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.=\r\nVedicAst rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www=\r\n.SriJagan nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n\r\n--9-4649162184-2890734638=:1--\r\n\n"}}
