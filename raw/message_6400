All other teachings=\r\n are mere play of words. Never think you are unfit for self-realization, th=\r\nat you are unfit for sannyasa or Vedanta. This cowardly nature will not lea=\r\nve you if you do not exert to know the truth as it really is. Better aim at=\r\n a lion and miss it, than hunt a jackal and catch it. Better aim at sannyas=\r\na and Vedanta and fail in its practice than live a worldly life and succeed=\r\n in it. Remember, O remember that you are born for this Supreme End, not fo=\r\nr anything else!\nMay you all empty yourselves of the ego through sannyasa a=\r\nnd may you all fill yourselves with the truth of Vedanta!\n\n\n"}}
