He was present on the\nf=\r\namous occasion when the ashram was robbed in 1924, and also on the occasion=\r\n\nwhen the golden mongoose visited Bhagavan at Skandashram.\n\nBelow relevant =\r\ninformation is from Sadhu Om=E2=80=99s Tamil account of Akhilandamma.\n\nMast=\r\nan, is a weaver who made the cloth for Bhagavan=E2=80=99s clothes, was born=\r\n in\n1878 in Desur, a small village about forty miles from Tiruvannamalai. H=\r\ne\ncame from a Muslim family but was drawn to Bhagavan by Akhilandamma, a wi=\r\ndow\nof the village who made regular trips to Tiruvannamalai to see Bhagavan=\r\n and\ncook for him. A document preserved in the shrine where Mastan is burie=\r\nd\nstates that at a very early age he would spontaneously fall into a\nsamadh=\r\ni-like state while he was working on the family loom. His hands and\nfeet, w=\r\nhich were plying the machinery of his trade, would stop and he would\nbecome=\r\n absolutely still. His parents, Hussain and Salubi, thought that he\nwas fal=\r\nling asleep on the job. Whenever they saw him in this condition, they\nwould=\r\n hit him, bring him back to his waking state, and tell him to get on\nwith h=\r\nis work. These episodes seem to have been a recurring feature of his\nchildh=\r\nood. The notebook in which this story is recorded says the =E2=80=98he plun=\r\nged\ninto jnana=E2=80=99 on these occasions, making it clear that they were =\r\nnot just\nfainting fits.\n\nMastan himself made no mention of these dramatic e=\r\nxperiences when he\ndescribed his early years:\n\nI came under the spell of bh=\r\nakti before the age of twenty. During the\nMuharram festival I would put on =\r\nthe garb of a pandaram [a Saiva monk],\nsmear vibhuti on myself, carry a beg=\r\nging bowl and roam around.\n\nI discovered and read the verses of Gunagudi Ma=\r\nstan [a Muslim saint who\nprobably lived during the early 19th century]. It =\r\noccurred to me that at the\nfollowing Muharram festival I should dress up as=\r\n a pandaram and sing these\nverses. I obtained a copy of this book, read the=\r\n portion entitled =E2=80=98Ecstatic\nJoy=E2=80=99 and tried to learn it by h=\r\neart.\n\nWhile I was doing this, it occurred to me that I should never again =\r\nput on\nthis pandaram outfit.\n\n=E2=80=98It is of no use,=E2=80=99 I thought.=\r\n =E2=80=98I should, instead, seek liberation.=E2=80=99\n\nFor one year after =\r\nthis decision I didn=E2=80=99t sleep either during the day or the\nnight. Mo=\r\nst of the time I was going through Gunagudi Mastan=E2=80=99s verses. I also=\r\n\nwent through the poems and songs of Thayumanavar and Pattinathar.\n\nThere i=\r\ns one verse of Gunagudi Mastan that says: =E2=80=98O mind, is it possible t=\r\no\nspeak of the misery and desolation experienced by those who get wedded to=\r\n\nwomen?=E2=80=99\n\nThis impressed me very much. There would be no marriage f=\r\nor me. When I\nbecame aware that my elder brothers, who were employed in the=\r\n army, were\nmaking arrangements to get me married, I shuddered.\n\nAt the age=\r\n of fifteen I lost my father, and when I was twenty-five my mother\ndied. Af=\r\nter these deaths I gave up the family weaving business. I had a Rs\n100 debt=\r\n from this work, but a devotee paid it off for me, freeing me from\nthis occ=\r\nupation.\n\n\nThis is how Mastan described the meeting when he spoke to Kunju =\r\nSwami:\n\nWhen I came to Bhagavan, he was seated like a rock=E2=80=A6. [His u=\r\nnwavering gaze]\nwas filled with grace, compassion and steady wisdom. I stoo=\r\nd by his side.\nAfter giving me a look, he opened the gate of my Heart and I=\r\n was also\nestablished in his state. I stood like that for eight hours, abso=\r\nlutely\nwithout fatigue, but filled with total absorption and peace. Bhagava=\r\nn in\nthose days used to open our Heart with a simple gracious look, and it\n=\r\ntransformed us. There was no need for any questions since he made us, by hi=\r\ns\nlook, like himself.\n\nSource: The Mountain Path, 1979, p. 154.\n\n\nAkhilanda=\r\nmma describes how they(Mastan) used to come to Tiruvannamalai\ntogether:\n\n\nM=\r\nastan and I would come to Arunachala from our village to have the pleasure\n=\r\nof serving Bhagavan. Mastan, a weaver, belonged to our village, but he did\n=\r\nnot stick to his craft. A man of whims, he would suddenly suspend his\nweavi=\r\nng and go to live with Bhagavan for months on end. During this time he\nwoul=\r\nd keep his body and soul together on alms that he begged.\n\nIn those early d=\r\nays we had no buses. I would make a bundle of provisions,\nsuch as rice and =\r\npulses, and put them on his head. Loaded in this way, we\nwould start on our=\r\n journey of forty miles to Arunachala. We would walk\nslowly and leisurely, =\r\ntelling each other stories of Bhagavan.\n\nMastan occasionally made towels an=\r\nd kaupinas and offered them to Bhagavan,\nwho accepted them with deep regard=\r\n.\n\nBhagavan once remarked, with great joy, =E2=80=98Mastan=E2=80=99s craft,=\r\n though it did not\ngive food either to him or his parents, gives me clothes=\r\n=E2=80=99.\n\n\nOn full moon nights we would go round the hill in the divine c=\r\nompany of\nBhagavan. In those days there would be about ten of us =E2=80=93 =\r\nPerumal, Mastan and\na few others. On those moonlit nights we would walk in =\r\nrapture, forgetting\nthe entire universe, except for the sacred mountain. I =\r\ndon=E2=80=99t think those\nenchanting days will ever come again!\n\nOn one of =\r\nthose occasions Mastan began to sing at the top of his voice. I\nhad never h=\r\neard him singing so loudly.\n\n=E2=80=98Mastan, what happened to you today?=\r\n=E2=80=99 asked Bhagavan as soon as the\npradakshina was over. =E2=80=98You =\r\nnever ever sing, so why did you sing like that?=E2=80=99\n\n=E2=80=98It was n=\r\nothing,=E2=80=99 replied Mastan, casually. =E2=80=98Perumal instructed me t=\r\nhat I\nhad to sing in order to ward off your drowsiness. To raise my spirits=\r\n and to\nequip me for the job, he made me take a drink containing ganja.=E2=\r\n=80=99\n\n=E2=80=98So that=E2=80=99s what happened. Ganja intoxication was be=\r\nhind your wild singing.\nHow many times have I told you that I need no exter=\r\nnal help to keep me\nawake? Also, I have told you before not to do anything =\r\nfor my sake. Don=E2=80=99t\nlisten to other people who tell you differently.=\r\n=E2=80=99\n\nThough Bhagavan rebuked Mastan in this way, I don=E2=80=99t thin=\r\nk he took the\ncriticism very seriously. Mastan was a very innocent man, and=\r\n events like\nthis didn=E2=80=99t touch him.\n\n\nI remember one incident that =\r\ntook place when Bhagavan lived at Skandashram.\nA golden mongoose entered th=\r\ne ashram premises and made straight for\nBhagavan. It sat on his lap for a w=\r\nhile. Later, it wandered around and\nclosely inspected all the different par=\r\nts of the cave. When the inspection\nwas over, it disappeared into the bushe=\r\ns on the hill. While all this was\nhappening, Mastan was the only devotee wi=\r\nth Bhagavan.\n\nSome time later Perumal came back to the ashram and Mastan to=\r\nld him about\nthe visit of the mongoose. One can get a glimpse of Mastan=E2=\r\n=80=99s state of mind\nat the time from the remarks he made.\n\n=E2=80=98I was=\r\n afraid that the mongoose might harm our peacocks,=E2=80=99 he said, =E2=80=\r\n=98so I\nkept myself ready in case it made an attack. I had a big stick hand=\r\ny.\nFortunately, it moved away without making any move towards the peacocks.=\r\n=E2=80=99\n\nPerumal told him, =E2=80=98Mastan, you should have caught it. If=\r\n you had managed to\ncapture it, we could have brought it up here and kept i=\r\nt as a pet.=E2=80=99\n\nBhagavan was listening to this conversation.\n\nAddress=\r\ning Mastan, he said, =E2=80=98Whom do you think he was? Do you think you\nco=\r\nuld have caught him, and do you think that this other man could have\ndomest=\r\nicated him? This was a sage of Arunachala who took on this form to\ncome and=\r\n visit me. He wanted to pay his respects to me. How many times have\nI told =\r\nyou that sages come to see me in various forms?=E2=80=99\n\nMastan never told=\r\n me about this mongoose. Bhagavan himself mentioned the\nincident to me on o=\r\nne of my later visits.\n\nSource: (=E2=80=98My Reminiscences=E2=80=99 by Akhi=\r\nlandamma, Arunachala Ramana, May 1982,\npp. 5-9)\n\n\nMastan continued to visit=\r\n Bhagavan throughout the 1920s, although his visits\nwere less frequent than=\r\n in earlier years. He was present in Ramanasramam,\nalong with a small numbe=\r\nr of other devotees, on a famous occasion in 1924\nwhen Bhagavan was attacke=\r\nd by a gang of robbers who were under the mistaken\nimpression that a large =\r\namount of money was kept there.\n\nBhagavan received a severe blow on his leg=\r\n during the robbery, but in a\ncharacteristic response he told the robbers, =\r\n=E2=80=98If you are not satisfied, you\nmay strike the other leg also=E2=80=\r\n=99.\n\nRamakrishna Swami, one of the devotees present, was so outraged by th=\r\ne\nassault on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s person, he took up an iron bar with the int=\r\nention of\nattacking the intruders.\n\nBhagavan restrained him, saying, =E2=80=\r\n=98Let these robbers play their role. We\nshall stick to ours. Let them do w=\r\nhat they like. It is for us to bear and\nforbear. Let us not interfere with =\r\nthem.=E2=80=99\n\nMastan appeared to follow Bhagavan=E2=80=99s advice during =\r\nthis attack since there\nis no record of him reacting in any way to the viol=\r\nent invasion. In one of\nhis rare recorded statements, Mastan is reported to=\r\n have said, =E2=80=98Even if the\nsky falls on your head, or even if a sword=\r\n is firmly driven through your\nchest, do not slip from your true state.=E2=\r\n=80=99 The final clause, which can\nequally well be translated as =E2=80=98d=\r\no not get agitated=E2=80=99, seems to sum up\nMastan=E2=80=99s response to t=\r\nhis event.\n\nAkhilandamma rushed to Tiruvannamalai when she heard the news. =\r\nThis is her\nreport of how Bhagavan reacted to the assault:\n\nWhat one could =\r\nnot imagine had happened: Bhagavan was beaten up by thieves.\nThe news took =\r\nwing and many like me ran to the ashram in great anxiety.\n\nSeeing me Bhagav=\r\nan expressed surprise and said, =E2=80=98Oh, Desuramma, you have\ncome as we=\r\nll. Kunju Swami is telling the story over there. Go and listen.=E2=80=99\n\nI=\r\nt was as though Bhagavan had directed some children to go and listen to a\ns=\r\ntory that was being told some distance away. I learned that Bhagavan had\nap=\r\npointed Kunju Swami to relate all the incidents surrounding the robbery.\nFr=\r\nom his reaction I gathered that the persistent questioning by devotees\nanno=\r\nyed Bhagavan more than even the beatings of the thieves.\n\nSitting at the fe=\r\net of Bhagavan and stroking the wounded leg, I expressed\nsurprise and sorro=\r\nw, saying, =E2=80=98How unjust! What injustice!=E2=80=99\n\nBhagavan contradi=\r\ncted me. =E2=80=98What injustice is there in this? As you feed me\nsweets, s=\r\no they have fed me blows, and I have received them too. However\nmany times =\r\nI tell you that I am not the body, it never goes into your\nhead.=E2=80=99\n\n=\r\n(=E2=80=98My Reminiscences=E2=80=99 by Akhilandamma, Arunachala Ramana, Jun=\r\ne 1982, pp. 23-4)\n\n\nBelow is Akhilandamma&#39;s description of Mastan&#39;s final m=\r\noments:\n\nHe was sick and bedridden for about a week. During those days he s=\r\npoke of\nmany things not of this world, as if he were actually seeing them.\n=\r\n\nHe said, =E2=80=98There, Nandiswara [Nandi the bull, the vehicle of Siva] =\r\nis\ndescending. He is very affectionately licking all over my body! Look! Th=\r\ne\nSiva ganas [celestial followers of Siva] are dancing here! See! They are\n=\r\nbeckoning me to come to their world. Look at those lotus ponds where\ncelest=\r\nial swans are swimming!=E2=80=99\n\nWe thought that this was nothing but deli=\r\nrium, but on the last day a very\nstrange thing happened, and we cannot ligh=\r\ntly dismiss it as delirium. On\nthis day he suddenly got up from his bed and=\r\n stood up, looking as if\nsomeone, face to face, had been calling him.\n\nThen=\r\n, in great excitement, he exclaimed, =E2=80=98Mother Apeetakuchamba, [the\nc=\r\nonsort of Siva in the Tiruvannamalai temple] have you come yourself to\nesco=\r\nrt me?=E2=80=99\n\nThe next moment he fell down dead. I immediately sent a me=\r\nssage to\nBhagavan.\n\nWhen Bhagavan learned of Mastan=E2=80=99s passing away,=\r\n he sent Kunju Swami to our\nvillage with full instructions on how to make a=\r\n samadhi for Mastan. There is\na Tamil book [Tirumular=E2=80=99s Tirumandira=\r\nm] that faithfully gives the details of\nhow saints who have followed Lord S=\r\niva have to be buried. In accordance with\nthese details Bhagavan drew up a =\r\nplan of the dimensions of the samadhi and\nsent it along with Kunju Swami. I=\r\nt seemed very strange to us that a Muslim\nshould be given a Saiva saint=E2=\r\n=80=99s burial and stranger still that Bhagavan, who\ndid not generally enco=\r\nurage ceremonial rites, actually laid down in the\nminutest detail the rites=\r\n to be followed in the samadhi of Mastan.\n\nWhatever the reason, just as Bha=\r\ngavan stipulated, we made a tomb for Mastan\nin our village. It is a village=\r\n whose population is predominantly Jain.\nThese inhabitants of the village f=\r\nelt that having a Hindu samadhi in their\nmidst would be very inauspicious. =\r\nWhen they first heard of it, there was\neven talk of their abandoning the vi=\r\nllage completely. However, in the time\nthat has passed since Mastan=E2=80=\r\n=99s samadhi was constructed, the village has\nthrived and grown rich. Nowad=\r\nays the samadhi is a visible deity to all\npeople from the village, whatever=\r\n their caste or religion. What a wonder!\n\n(=E2=80=98My Reminiscences=E2=80=\r\n=99 by Akhilandamma, Arunachala Ramana, May 1982, pp. 5-9.)\n\nBhagavan only =\r\nordered this type of samadhi for three of his devotees: his\nmother, Lakshmi=\r\n the cow, and Mastan.\n\nSome days later Akhilandamma went to Tiruvannamalai =\r\nto tell Bhagavan about\nMastan=E2=80=99s passing away:\n\nI went to Bhagavan a=\r\nnd described the final days of Mastan.\n\nUpon hearing about them Bhagavan co=\r\nmmented, =E2=80=98Maybe the universal mother,\nApeetakuchamba, personally ca=\r\nme to take him. All his descriptions tally with\nthe world of Siva. Mastan w=\r\nas an unassuming devotee. He had a wealth of\nhidden spiritual experiences. =\r\nIt is a matter for gratification that he\npassed away in your care and under=\r\n your supervision.=E2=80=99\n\n(=E2=80=98My Reminiscences=E2=80=99 by Akhilan=\r\ndamma, Arunachala Ramana, May 1982, pp. 5-9.)\n\n\nSources:\n\n1) http://sri-ram=\r\nana-maharshi.blogspot.com/2008/09/discovering-mastan.html\n2) http://srirama=\r\nnamaharshi.org/pdf/Saranagathi_eNewsletter_October_2008.pdf\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=\r\n=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=\r\n=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=\r\n=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd20d62e8e18804807ca4ac\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\nMastan himself had passed away in 1931, and he had received litt=\r\nle more than passing mentions in the ashram books I had read.=C2=A0&lt;span st=\r\nyle=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;He was present on the famous occasion when the ash=\r\nram was robbed in 1924, and also on the occasion when the golden mongoose v=\r\nisited Bhagavan at Skandashram.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:=\r\nbold&quot;&gt;Below relevant information is from Sadhu Om=E2=80=99s Tamil account o=\r\nf Akhilandamma.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Mastan, is a=\r\n weaver who made the cloth for Bhagavan=E2=80=99s clothes, was born in 1878=\r\n in Desur, a small village about forty miles from Tiruvannamalai.

I =\r\nobtained a copy of this book, read the portion entitled =E2=80=98Ecstatic J=\r\noy=E2=80=99 and tried to learn it by heart.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;While I was doin=\r\ng this, it occurred to me that I should never again put on this pandaram ou=\r\ntfit.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=E2=80=98It is of no use,=E2=80=99 I thought. =E2=80=98I=\r\n should, instead, seek liberation.=E2=80=99=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;For one year after=\r\n this decision I didn=E2=80=99t sleep either during the day or the night. M=\r\nost of the time I was going through Gunagudi Mastan=E2=80=99s verses. I als=\r\no went through the poems and songs of Thayumanavar and Pattinathar.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;There is one verse of Gunagudi Mastan th=\r\nat says: =E2=80=98O mind, is it possible to speak of the misery and desolat=\r\nion experienced by those who get wedded to women?=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;This impr=\r\nessed me very much. There would be no marriage for me. When I became aware =\r\nthat my elder brothers, who were employed in the army, were making arrangem=\r\nents to get me married, I shuddered.=C2=A0&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;At the age of fi=\r\nfteen I lost my father, and when I was twenty-five my mother died. After th=\r\nese deaths I gave up the family weaving business. I had a Rs 100 debt from =\r\nthis work, but a devotee paid it off for me, freeing me from this occupatio=\r\nn.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;This is how Mastan describ=\r\ned the meeting when he spoke to Kunju Swami:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When I came to B=\r\nhagavan, he was seated like a rock=E2=80=A6. [His unwavering gaze] was fill=\r\ned with grace, compassion and steady wisdom. I stood by his side. After giv=\r\ning me a look, he opened the gate of my Heart and I was also established in=\r\n his state. I stood like that for eight hours, absolutely without fatigue, =\r\nbut filled with total absorption and peace. Bhagavan in those days used to =\r\nopen our Heart with a simple gracious look, and it transformed us. There wa=\r\ns no need for any questions since he made us, by his look, like himself.=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source: The Mountain Path, 19=\r\n79, p. 154.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Akhilandamma=\r\n describes how they(Mastan) used to come to Tiruvannamalai together:&lt;/span&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mastan and I would come to Arunachala from our village to have=\r\n the pleasure of serving Bhagavan. Mastan, a weaver, belonged to our villag=\r\ne, but he did not stick to his craft. A man of whims, he would suddenly sus=\r\npend his weaving and go to live with Bhagavan for months on end. During thi=\r\ns time he would keep his body and soul together on alms that he begged.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;In those early days we had no buses.=\r\n I would make a bundle of provisions, such as rice and pulses, and put them=\r\n on his head. Loaded in this way, we would start on our journey of forty mi=\r\nles to Arunachala. We would walk slowly and leisurely, telling each other s=\r\ntories of Bhagavan.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Mastan=\r\n occasionally made towels and kaupinas and offered them to Bhagavan, who ac=\r\ncepted them with deep regard.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weigh=\r\nt:bold&quot;&gt;Bhagavan once remarked, with great joy, =E2=80=98Mastan=E2=80=99s c=\r\nraft, though it did not give food either to him or his parents, gives me cl=\r\nothes=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-style:italic&quot;&gt;On fu=\r\nll moon nights we would go round the hill in the divine company of Bhagavan=\r\n. In those days there would be about ten of us =E2=80=93 Perumal, Mastan an=\r\nd a few others. On those moonlit nights we would walk in rapture, forgettin=\r\ng the entire universe, except for the sacred mountain. I don=E2=80=99t thin=\r\nk those enchanting days will ever come again!&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;On one of those occa=\r\nsions Mastan began to sing at the top of his voice. I had never heard him s=\r\ninging so loudly.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=E2=80=98Mastan, what happened to you today?=\r\n=E2=80=99 asked Bhagavan as soon as the pradakshina was over. =E2=80=98You =\r\nnever ever sing, so why did you sing like that?=E2=80=99=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=E2=\r\n=80=98It was nothing,=E2=80=99 replied Mastan, casually. =E2=80=98Perumal i=\r\nnstructed me that I had to sing in order to ward off your drowsiness. To ra=\r\nise my spirits and to equip me for the job, he made me take a drink contain=\r\ning ganja.=E2=80=99=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=E2=80=98So that=E2=80=99s what happened=\r\n. Ganja intoxication was behind your wild singing. How many times have I to=\r\nld you that I need no external help to keep me awake? Also, I have told you=\r\n before not to do anything for my sake. Don=E2=80=99t listen to other peopl=\r\ne who tell you differently.=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Though Bhagavan rebuked Masta=\r\nn in this way, I don=E2=80=99t think he took the criticism very seriously. =\r\nMastan was a very innocent man, and events like this didn=E2=80=99t touch h=\r\nim.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I remember one incident that took place when Bhagavan=\r\n lived at Skandashram. A golden mongoose entered the ashram premises and ma=\r\nde straight for Bhagavan. It sat on his lap for a while. Later, it wandered=\r\n around and closely inspected all the different parts of the cave. When the=\r\n inspection was over, it disappeared into the bushes on the hill. While all=\r\n this was happening, Mastan was the only devotee with Bhagavan.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;So=\r\nme time later Perumal came back to the ashram and Mastan told him about the=\r\n visit of the mongoose. One can get a glimpse of Mastan=E2=80=99s state of =\r\nmind at the time from the remarks he made.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=E2=80=98I was afraid tha=\r\nt the mongoose might harm our peacocks,=E2=80=99 he said, =E2=80=98so I kep=\r\nt myself ready in case it made an attack. I had a big stick handy. Fortunat=\r\nely, it moved away without making any move towards the peacocks.=E2=80=99&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Perumal told him, =E2=80=98Mastan, you should have caught it. If yo=\r\nu had managed to capture it, we could have brought it up here and kept it a=\r\ns a pet.=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan was listening to this conversation.=C2=A0=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Addressing Mastan, he said, =E2=80=\r\n=98Whom do you think he was? Do you think you could have caught him, and do=\r\n you think that this other man could have domesticated him? This was a sage=\r\n of Arunachala who took on this form to come and visit me. He wanted to pay=\r\n his respects to me. How many times have I told you that sages come to see =\r\nme in various forms?=E2=80=99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Mastan never told me about th=\r\nis mongoose. Bhagavan himself mentioned the incident to me on one of my lat=\r\ner visits.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Source&lt;/span&gt;:=C2=\r\n=A0&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;(=E2=80=98My Reminiscences=E2=80=99 by =\r\nAkhilandamma, Arunachala Ramana, May 1982, pp. 5-9)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Mas=\r\ntan continued to visit Bhagavan throughout the 1920s, although his visits w=\r\nere less frequent than in earlier years. He was present in Ramanasramam, al=\r\nong with a small number of other devotees, on a famous occasion in 1924 whe=\r\nn Bhagavan was attacked by a gang of robbers who were under the mistaken im=\r\npression that a large amount of money was kept there.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan rec=\r\neived a severe blow on his leg during the robbery, but in a characteristic =\r\nresponse he told the robbers, =E2=80=98If you are not satisfied, you may st=\r\nrike the other leg also=E2=80=99.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Ramakrishna Swami, one of the devo=\r\ntees present, was so outraged by the assault on Bhagavan=E2=80=99s person, =\r\nhe took up an iron bar with the intention of attacking the intruders.&lt;br&gt;\n\n=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Bhagavan restrained him, saying, =E2=\r\n=80=98Let these robbers play their role. We shall stick to ours. Let them d=\r\no what they like. It is for us to bear and forbear. Let us not interfere wi=\r\nth them.=E2=80=99&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Mastan appeared to follow Bhagavan=E2=80=\r\n=99s advice during this attack since there is no record of him reacting in =\r\nany way to the violent invasion. In one of his rare recorded statements, Ma=\r\nstan is reported to have said, =E2=80=98Even if the sky falls on your head,=\r\n or even if a sword is firmly driven through your chest, do not slip from y=\r\nour true state.=E2=80=99 The final clause, which can equally well be transl=\r\nated as =E2=80=98do not get agitated=E2=80=99, seems to sum up Mastan=E2=80=\r\n=99s response to this event.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Akhilandamma rushed to Tiruvannamalai=\r\n when she heard the news. This is her report of how Bhagavan reacted to the=\r\n assault:=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;What one could not imagine had happened: Bhagavan wa=\r\ns beaten up by thieves. The news took wing and many like me ran to the ashr=\r\nam in great anxiety.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Seeing me Bhagavan expressed surprise and sai=\r\nd, =E2=80=98Oh, Desuramma, you have come as well. Kunju Swami is telling th=\r\ne story over there. Go and listen.=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;It was as though Bhagava=\r\nn had directed some children to go and listen to a story that was being tol=\r\nd some distance away. I learned that Bhagavan had appointed Kunju Swami to =\r\nrelate all the incidents surrounding the robbery. From his reaction I gathe=\r\nred that the persistent questioning by devotees annoyed Bhagavan more than =\r\neven the beatings of the thieves.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Sitting at the feet of Bhagavan =\r\nand stroking the wounded leg, I expressed surprise and sorrow, saying, =E2=\r\n=80=98How unjust! What injustice!=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Bhagavan contradicted me.=\r\n =E2=80=98What injustice is there in this? As you feed me sweets, so they h=\r\nave fed me blows, and I have received them too. However many times I tell y=\r\nou that I am not the body, it never goes into your head.=E2=80=99=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;(=E2=80=98My Reminiscences=E2=80=99 =\r\nby Akhilandamma, Arunachala Ramana, June 1982, pp. 23-4)&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Below is Akhilandamma&#39;s description of=\r\n Mastan&#39;s final moments:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bol=\r\nd&quot;&gt;He was sick and bedridden for about a week. During those days he spoke o=\r\nf many things not of this world, as if he were actually seeing them.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;He said, =E2=80=98There, Nandiswara [Nandi the bull, the vehicle of Siva] =\r\nis descending. He is very affectionately licking all over my body! Look! Th=\r\ne Siva ganas [celestial followers of Siva] are dancing here! See! They are =\r\nbeckoning me to come to their world. Look at those lotus ponds where celest=\r\nial swans are swimming!=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;We thought that this was nothing =\r\nbut delirium, but on the last day a very strange thing happened, and we can=\r\nnot lightly dismiss it as delirium. On this day he suddenly got up from his=\r\n bed and stood up, looking as if someone, face to face, had been calling hi=\r\nm.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Then, in great excitement, he exclaimed, =E2=80=98Mother Apeeta=\r\nkuchamba, [the consort of Siva in the Tiruvannamalai temple] have you come =\r\nyourself to escort me?=E2=80=99&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;The next moment he fell down dead. I=\r\n immediately sent a message to Bhagavan.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;When Bhagavan learn=\r\ned of Mastan=E2=80=99s passing away, he sent Kunju Swami to our village wit=\r\nh full instructions on how to make a samadhi for Mastan.&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0There =\r\nis a Tamil book [Tirumular=E2=80=99s Tirumandiram] that faithfully gives th=\r\ne details of how saints who have followed Lord Siva have to be buried. In a=\r\nccordance with these details Bhagavan drew up a plan of the dimensions of t=\r\nhe samadhi and sent it along with Kunju Swami. It seemed very strange to us=\r\n that a Muslim should be given a Saiva saint=E2=80=99s burial and stranger =\r\nstill that Bhagavan, who did not generally encourage ceremonial rites, actu=\r\nally laid down in the minutest detail the rites to be followed in the samad=\r\nhi of Mastan.=C2=A0&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;Whatever the reason, just as Bhagavan stipulat=\r\ned, we made a tomb for Mastan in our village. It is a village whose populat=\r\nion is predominantly Jain. These inhabitants of the village felt that havin=\r\ng a Hindu samadhi in their midst would be very inauspicious. When they firs=\r\nt heard of it, there was even talk of their abandoning the village complete=\r\nly. However, in the time that has passed since Mastan=E2=80=99s samadhi was=\r\n constructed, the village has thrived and grown rich. Nowadays the samadhi =\r\nis a visible deity to all people from the village, whatever their caste or =\r\nreligion.
