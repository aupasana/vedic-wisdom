The Shiva refered to by Shri Guru Gora=\r\nkshanatha is the Parabrahman. The Shakti is Mula Prakriti. The same names m=\r\nean different things to different people/traditions.\nSo this Shiva is not t=\r\nhe same Shiva as one of the Trimurti.\n\nIn general anthropomorphism( includi=\r\nng the male female distinction) helps in the beginning but is not the ultim=\r\nate reality. One can read samskrita and translate- but the understanding ha=\r\ns to come from the heart-For that it is the grace of the Guru and the Devat=\r\nha alone that is responsible.\n\nForgive me if I speak like a big man, I am j=\r\nust a beginner. Much of what I say, I repeat parrot like from what my Guru&#39;=\r\ns grace has enabled me to read. \n\nGum Gurubhyo namaha\n\nS\n\n--- In vedic-wisd=\r\nom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;vedicastrostudent&quot; &lt;vedicastrostudent@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nDear Narasimhaji and others,\n&gt; \n&gt; Struggling how to put this properly but I=\r\n have been wondering a lot about the above concept, especially in relation =\r\nto the results of mantras for the same. The same theme repeats itself over =\r\nand over again in many ways:\n&gt; \n&gt; o Shiva/Shakti\n&gt; o Prakriti/Purusha\n&gt; o I=\r\nn astrology mantras for planets versus mantras for signs (signs always rela=\r\nted to mahavidya/devi)\n&gt; o General literature about male/female gods and th=\r\neir progeny\n&gt; \n&gt; Overall, it seems to me that the idea is one of progressiv=\r\ne manifestation (of consciousness/form/individuality). The male is the mani=\r\nfester, the female is the field/area in which the manifestation will occur =\r\nand the progeny (in the cases there is progeny) is the result. The result i=\r\ns always at a progressively more outward level. \n&gt; \n&gt; I assume this is the =\r\nidea behind all the male/female symbolism. Please correct me if this is wro=\r\nng. However, I still struggle with what is the result of devi/mahavidya man=\r\ntra versus the other (I assume &quot;male&quot;) mantras. Extending the same concept =\r\nas above, it would seem that the non-devi/non-mahavidya type mantras are th=\r\ne ones that result in aligning one&#39;s actions with whatever it is that the m=\r\nantra&#39;s goal is. While devi/mahavidya type mantras, in going with same symb=\r\nolism, would not actually directly influence one&#39;s actions but would give k=\r\nnowledge of the area of action, and thereby help in making the correct choi=\r\nce when indeed the time comes for action. This is purely my own conclusion.=\r\n Is this correct?\n&gt; \n&gt; And even so, I still don&#39;t understand why there seem=\r\ns to be a requirement for precision and exactness in devi/mahavidya type sa=\r\ndhana but not in the non-devi type sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please forgive me if I am =\r\nsimplifying things too much. Any and all comments are more than welcome, I =\r\nam simply trying to improve my understanding (for now).\n&gt; \n&gt; Sincerely,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Sundeep\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
