Any act done u=\r\nnder ignorance will yield only further bondage and\neclipse, and trap the so=\r\nul into the chakravyuha(tornado) of the maaya.&gt;&gt;\n=C2=A0\nYou claim that ther=\r\ne is no &quot;eclipse&quot; or covering or bondage in the first place (because it is =\r\n&quot;ignorance&quot; and not real) and yet speak of &quot;further bondage and eclipse&quot;! H=\r\now can something that doesn&#39;t even exist, increase or decrease?\n=C2=A0\nIt E=\r\nITHER does not exist at all OR exists and keeps increasing/decreasing. You =\r\ncan&#39;t have it both ways! :-)\n=C2=A0\nNow let us examine these 2 cases separa=\r\ntely.\n=C2=A0\nCase 1: Eclipse/bondage does not even exist. So it does not in=\r\ncrease/decrease. There is nothing to discuss! :-)\n=C2=A0\nCase 2: Eclipse/bo=\r\nndage exists and some acts increase it and some decrease it. It is not mere=\r\nly efforts to &quot;overcome&quot; this eclipse/bondage that may increase it. So many=\r\n other acts could increase it. Some people may have engaged in too many suc=\r\nh activities and accumulated so much eclipse/bondage/covering of the innate=\r\n divinity that it may actually need a lot of effort to undo it!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nIt is very easy to claim that all is god and that even c=\r\nonsidering that there is some covering is an ignorance.\n=C2=A0\nThough every=\r\nthing is Self, Self is that which is unborn and un-perishing. We are surrou=\r\nnded by many manifestations of Self that are transient, i.e. they are born =\r\nand they perish. When we come in contact with them, we do not focus on thei=\r\nr imperishable essence, but focus on the transient/perishable portion that =\r\nis more readily perceptible to our senses, manas, buddhi and chitta.\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nThis perishable/transient portion is what we mean by covering/eclipse.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nSuppose one&#39;s leg is cut off, blood starts to gush out and one is about=\r\n to die in a little time. Can one remain equanimous during that time and ge=\r\nnuinely think &quot;this body and the blood I perceive are transient. They are a=\r\nctually manifestations of imperishable Self. I do not care about transient =\r\nmanifestations. I only care about the imperishable Self. I am Self&quot;?\n=C2=A0=\r\n\nThis is just one example. Depending on the person, many such examples can =\r\nbe given, where pretensions of &quot;I am Self&quot; can be shattered and one will be=\r\ng &quot;forget about Self. I am in deep trouble. Somebody please help me out of =\r\nthis situation&quot;!\n=C2=A0\nIf one is established in Self and NO situation ever=\r\n disturbs one&#39;s equanimity, only then one is realized. Such a state is not =\r\neasy to achieve as some pseudo-Vedantins may suggest.\n=C2=A0\nAs I said belo=\r\nw, this is just a case of &quot;a long path of\nconstant contemplation and self-c=\r\norrection can be reduced to a quick delusional\njump to the end&quot;. Unless one=\r\n catches it whenever something transient and perishable is drawing one&#39;s at=\r\ntention, one will not overcome each such instinct. Until each such instinct=\r\n is overcome, &quot;all is imperishable Self&quot; is just a theory one is repeating =\r\nlike a parrot. The covering/eclipse/bondage is quite real until then.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nUnfortunately, some assertions of Jnana Yoga an=\r\nd Adwaita Vedanta can be misleading. I will try to explain it with a nice a=\r\nnalogy from physics.\n=C2=A0\nThis world is made up of different objects. The=\r\ny are made up of molecules with a lot of vacuum in between them. Molecules =\r\nare made up of atoms and a lot of vacuum in between them. Atoms are made up=\r\n of electrons, protons etc and a lot of vacuum in between them. Even those =\r\nparticles are made up of smaller particles and a lot of vacuum in between t=\r\nhem. As you keep dividing, you will see that things are made up of subtle p=\r\nortions of matter and a lot of vacuum. When you go to the level of small pa=\r\nrticles, work by physicists such as Heisenberg, Broglie, Schroedinger etc s=\r\nays that you can&#39;t even observe and determine the properties of those parti=\r\ncles confidently without affecting them. They may not even exist as &quot;matter=\r\n&quot; with specific location and momentum or even as waves, independent of the =\r\nobserver.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, despite that &quot;quantum mechanics&quot; reality at the s=\r\nubtlest level, we have normal &quot;mechanics&quot; too. A lot of gross objects made =\r\nup of=C2=A0 those subtle particles are gross enough and obey some grosser l=\r\naws of physics (e.g. Newton&#39;s laws). We can find their positions, momentum =\r\netc accurately and make them move deterministically.\n=C2=A0\nWhen one is des=\r\nigning a car or a pulley system or a rocket, one can leave quantum mechanic=\r\ns and use normal mechanics. However, when one is doing research on bosons e=\r\ntc, one must pay attention to quantum mechanics. Otherwise, one will commit=\r\n errors.\n=C2=A0\nSimilarly, at the subtlest level, Self alone exists. Things=\r\n that seem to exist may not even exist independent of the observer. However=\r\n, there are also the laws of karma that govern the grosser reality (body, h=\r\nealth, job, spouse, children, house, car, money etc). Rishis taught Adwaita=\r\n Vedanta and also the laws that govern the world of duality (e.g. the law o=\r\nf karma).\n=C2=A0\nWhen one&#39;s awareness focuses on gross objects and one is w=\r\norking with the gross world, one better leave &quot;quantum spirituality&quot; (Adwai=\r\nta Vedanta) and focus on normal spirituality. However, when one&#39;s awareness=\r\n becomes very subtle and one starts to deal with mystical experiences, deit=\r\nies etc, one must pay attention to Adwaita Vedanta. Otherwise, one will com=\r\nmit errors!!\n=C2=A0\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n--------\nAstrology & Spirituali=\r\nty Resources: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n--------\n\n=C2=A0\n\n\n&gt;__________=\r\n______________________\n&gt; From: Kannan Iyengar &lt;prof.kannan.iyengar@...=\r\nm&gt;\n&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;Sent: Saturday, August 24, 2013 5:21=\r\n PM\n&gt;Subject: RE: [vedic-wisdom] Re: which path to choose?-a dialog\n&gt; \n&gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt;Dear Shri Narasimha Ji,\n&gt;Namasthe\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;1.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 I deeply appreciate and feel grateful for having shared =\r\nyour\nunderstandings.

Let me tell y=\r\nou that\ntruth/clarity does not need any support, because it stands itself a=\r\ns a support\nfor all.(In Hindi, =E2=80=9Csatya ko pramaan ki aavashyakta nah=\r\ni hai, satya\nswayam apna pramaan hai=E2=80=9D)\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;3.=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 Secondly, if what you have\nquoted from Swami Vivekana=\r\nnda is true, then I am skeptical about Swami Vivekananda=E2=80=99s\nundersta=\r\nndings himself. Let me tell you that divinity of soul is ever-existing\nlike=\r\n Sun (Sadaa Jaagati Jyoti)(ever shining light). So do you need any effort\nt=\r\no manifest it? Do you mean to say that the ever-shining Brahman is at the\nm=\r\nercy of our efforts to get itself manifested? Perhaps..But let us ponder wh=\r\nat\nactually caused that sunlight to be eclipsed? Let me tell you that the\nv=\r\nery idea of considering that divinity to be eclipsed is ignorance; and\ncons=\r\nequently trying to make an effort to remove that eclipse, is a greater\nigno=\r\nrance.

It is very\nmuch\n&gt;&gt; pos=\r\nsible and in fact is a measure of self realized people.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Indeed, on=\r\ne can carve one&#39;s own niche by combining multiple paths. They are not\nmeant=\r\n to be mutually exclusive.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;I&#39;ll quote Swami Vivekananda from his b=\r\nook &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; where he makes\na comment on the 4 paths:\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;&quot;Each sou=\r\nl is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest this divinity\nwithin by co=\r\nntrolling nature: external and internal. Do this either by work or\nworship =\r\nor psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or more, or all of these -\nand =\r\nbe free.&quot;\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Here are my 2 cents.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Jnana yoga emphasizes on p=\r\nhilosophization and wisdom. Karma yoga emphasizes on\nwork and detachment. R=\r\naja yoga emphasizes on self-control and self-mastery.\nBhakti yoga emphasize=\r\ns on devotion and surrender to Supreme. One can pick whatever\nis natural to=\r\n one and try to develop that quality. However, wisdom, detached\naction, sel=\r\nf-control and surrender to the Supreme are not mutually exclusive.\nAs one o=\r\nf these qualities develops nicely in one, others will automatically\ndevelop=\r\n too! Finally, a realized person (i.e. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or\noneness) will have =\r\nall these qualities fully blossomed.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Forget about horoscope, navam=\r\nsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc. Irrespective of\nthat, I strongly recommend =\r\nagainst Raja yoga for 99% of humanity. Even Ramakrishna\nadvised against it.=\r\n Controlling body and mind and forcing the psychic life\nforce to purify and=\r\n ascend requires strict yama and niyama and clean nadis. In\nthis age of pol=\r\nluted air, water and food, nadis accumulate great amounts of\nobstructions a=\r\nnd Raja yoga can be dangerous. This is not just my view, but what\nRamakrish=\r\nna explicitly taught in &quot;Gospel of Ramakrishna&quot; (one of the\ngreatest spirit=\r\nual texts IMHO). He discouraged several of his sishyas from\npursuing Raja Y=\r\noga. He taught it to Vivekananda, but did not encourage even him\nto practic=\r\ne it.\n&gt;=C2=A0\n&gt;Jnana yoga is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of f=\r\nalling into the\ndelusional trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are no=\r\nt\nsincere/honest/smart enough for it. It is easy to delude that &quot;all is Bra=\r\nhman.\nI am Brahman. Whatever I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s all a =\r\ndelusion\nanyway&quot; without fully overcoming all innate conditioning that rein=\r\nforces\nduality in consciousness every instant. Kind of like declaring wisel=\r\ny in a\nmovie that &quot;it&#39;s just a movie and not reality&quot;, but flinching in\neve=\r\nry scary scene, crying in every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty,\nsi=\r\nncerely and earnestness, jnana yoga can be problematic too.

How can something that doesn&#39;t even exist, increase or decrease?&lt;br&gt;&n=\r\nbsp;&lt;br&gt;It EITHER does not exist at all OR exists and keeps increasing/decr=\r\neasing. You can&#39;t have it both ways! :-)&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Now let us examine th=\r\nese 2 cases separately.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Case 1: Eclipse/bondage does not even =\r\nexist. So it does not increase/decrease. There is nothing to discuss! :-)&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Case 2: Eclipse/bondage exists and some acts increase it and so=\r\nme decrease it. It is not merely efforts to &quot;overcome&quot; this eclipse/bondage=\r\n that may increase\n it. So many other acts could increase it. Some people m=\r\nay have engaged in too many such activities and accumulated so much eclipse=\r\n/bondage/covering of the innate divinity that it may actually need a lot of=\r\n effort to undo it!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;It is very eas=\r\ny to claim that all is god and that even considering that there is some cov=\r\nering is an ignorance.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Though everything is Self, Self is that=\r\n which is unborn and un-perishing. We are surrounded by many manifestations=\r\n of Self that are transient, i.e. they are born and they perish. When we co=\r\nme in contact with them, we do not focus on their imperishable essence, but=\r\n focus on the transient/perishable portion that is more readily perceptible=\r\n to our senses, manas, buddhi and chitta.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;This perishable/tran=\r\nsient portion is what we mean by covering/eclipse.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Suppose one=\r\n&#39;s leg is\n cut off, blood starts to gush out and one is about to die in a l=\r\nittle time. Can one remain equanimous during that time and genuinely think =\r\n&quot;this body and the blood I perceive are transient. They are actually manife=\r\nstations of imperishable Self. I do not care about transient manifestations=\r\n. I only care about the imperishable Self. I am Self&quot;?&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;This is=\r\n just one example. Depending on the person, many such examples can be given=\r\n, where pretensions of &quot;I am Self&quot; can be shattered and one will beg &quot;forge=\r\nt about Self. I am in deep trouble. Somebody please help me out of this sit=\r\nuation&quot;!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;If one is established in Self and NO situation ever d=\r\nisturbs one&#39;s equanimity, only then one is realized. Such a state is not ea=\r\nsy to achieve as some pseudo-Vedantins may suggest.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-size:10.0pt;color:black;&quot;&gt;As I said below, this is just a case of=\r\n &quot;a long path of\nconstant contemplation and self-correction can be reduced =\r\nto a quick delusional\njump to the end&quot;.&lt;/span&gt; Unless one catches it whenev=\r\ner something transient and perishable is drawing one&#39;s attention, one will =\r\nnot overcome each such instinct. Until each such instinct is overcome, &quot;all=\r\n is imperishable Self&quot; is just a theory one is repeating like a parrot. The=\r\n covering/eclipse/bondage is quite real until then.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Unfortunately, some assertions of Jnana Yoga and Adwaita =\r\nVedanta can be misleading. I will try to explain it with a nice analogy fro=\r\nm physics.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;This world is made up of different objects. They ar=\r\ne made up of molecules with a lot of vacuum in between them. Molecules are =\r\nmade up of atoms and a lot of vacuum in between them. Atoms are made up of =\r\nelectrons, protons etc and a lot of vacuum in between them. Even those part=\r\nicles are made up of smaller particles and a lot of vacuum in between them.=\r\n As you keep\n dividing, you will see that things are made up of subtle port=\r\nions of matter and a lot of vacuum. When you go to the level of small parti=\r\ncles, work by physicists such as Heisenberg, Broglie, Schroedinger etc says=\r\n that you can&#39;t even observe and determine the properties of those particle=\r\ns confidently without affecting them. They may not even exist as &quot;matter&quot; w=\r\nith specific location and momentum or even as waves, independent of the obs=\r\nerver.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;However, despite that &quot;quantum mechanics&quot; reality at th=\r\ne subtlest level, we have normal &quot;mechanics&quot; too. A lot of gross objects ma=\r\nde up of&nbsp; those subtle particles are gross enough and obey some grosse=\r\nr laws of physics (e.g. Newton&#39;s laws). We can find their positions, moment=\r\num etc accurately and make them move deterministically.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When o=\r\nne is designing a car or a pulley system or a rocket, one can leave quantum=\r\n mechanics and use normal mechanics. However, when one is doing research on=\r\n\n bosons etc, one must pay attention to quantum mechanics. Otherwise, one w=\r\nill commit errors.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Similarly, at the subtlest level, Self alon=\r\ne exists. Things that seem to exist may not even exist independent of the o=\r\nbserver. However, there are also the laws of karma that govern the grosser =\r\nreality (body, health, job, spouse, children, house, car, money etc). Rishi=\r\ns taught Adwaita Vedanta and also the laws that govern the world of duality=\r\n (e.g. the law of karma).&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;When one&#39;s awareness focuses on gros=\r\ns objects and one is working with the gross world, one better leave &quot;quantu=\r\nm spirituality&quot; (Adwaita Vedanta) and focus on normal spirituality. However=\r\n, when one&#39;s awareness becomes very subtle and one starts to deal with myst=\r\nical experiences, deities etc, one must pay attention to Adwaita Vedanta. O=\r\ntherwise, one will commit errors!!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a\n rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot;=\r\n target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.Vedi=\r\ncAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:rgb(0, 0, 0);font-size:13px;fo=\r\nnt-family:arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;background-color:transparent;=\r\nfont-style:normal;&quot;&gt;--------&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); fo=\r\nnt-size: 13px; font-family: arial,helvetica,clean,sans-serif; background-co=\r\nlor: transparent; font-style: normal;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;borde=\r\nr-left: 2px solid rgb(16, 16, 255); margin-left: 5px; margin-top: 5px; padd=\r\ning-left: 5px;&quot;&gt;  &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: arial, helvetica, sans-serif; =\r\nfont-size: 10pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div style=3D&quot;font-family: times new roman, new york, ti=\r\nmes, serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt; &lt;div dir=3D&quot;ltr&quot;&gt; &lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;  &lt;font fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Arial&quot; size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/=\r\nb&gt; Kannan Iyengar &lt;prof.kannan.iyengar@...&gt;&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=\r\n=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com &lt;br&gt;\n &lt;=\r\nb&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Saturday, August 24, =\r\n2013 5:21 PM&lt;br&gt; &lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; =\r\nRE: [vedic-wisdom] Re: which path to choose?-a dialog&lt;br&gt; &lt;/font&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;d=\r\niv class=3D&quot;y_msg_container&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv7625187074&quot;&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;display:none;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;\n\n\n\n    &lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv762518=\r\n7074ygrp-text&quot;&gt;\n      \n      \n      &lt;div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv76251=\r\n87074Section1&quot;&gt;\n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv7625187074MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-=\r\nsize:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;&quot;&gt;Dear Shri Narasimha Ji,&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \n\n&lt;div cla=\r\nss=3D&quot;yiv7625187074MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D=\r\n;&quot;&gt;Namasthe&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;yiv7625187074MsoNormal&quot;&gt;&lt;span styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;&quot;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/div&gt; \n\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;=\r\nyiv7625187074MsoListParagraph&quot;&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497=\r\nD;&quot;&gt;&lt;span&gt;1.&lt;span style=3D&quot;font:7.0pt;&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-size:11.0pt;color:#1F497D;&quot;&gt;I de=\r\neply appreciate and feel grateful for having shared your\nunderstandings.

Let me tell you that divinity of s=\r\noul is ever-existing\nlike Sun (Sadaa Jaagati Jyoti)(ever shining light). So=\r\n do you need any effort\nto manifest it?

It is very\nmuch&lt;br&gt;\n=\r\n&gt; possible and in fact is a measure of self realized people.&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\nIndeed, one can carve one&#39;s own niche by combining multiple paths. They=\r\n are not\nmeant to be mutually exclusive.&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\nI&#39;ll quote Swami Vi=\r\nvekananda from his book &quot;Raja Yoga&quot; where he makes\na comment on the 4 paths=\r\n:&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n&quot;Each soul is potentially divine. The goal is to manifest =\r\nthis divinity\nwithin by controlling nature: external and internal. Do this =\r\neither by work or\nworship or psychic control, or philosophy - by one, or mo=\r\nre, or all of these -\nand be free.&quot;&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\nHere are my 2 cents.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\nJnana yoga emphasizes on philosophization and wisdom. Karma yog=\r\na emphasizes on\nwork and detachment. Raja yoga emphasizes on self-control a=\r\nnd self-mastery.\nBhakti yoga emphasizes on devotion and surrender to Suprem=\r\ne. One can pick whatever\nis natural to one and try to develop that quality.=\r\n However, wisdom, detached\naction, self-control and surrender to the Suprem=\r\ne are not mutually exclusive.\nAs one of these qualities develops nicely in =\r\none, others will automatically\ndevelop too! Finally, a realized person (i.e=\r\n. one in &quot;Yoga&quot; or\noneness) will have all these qualities fully blossomed.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\nForget about horoscope, navamsa, vimsamsa, nakshatramsa etc.=\r\n Irrespective of\nthat, I strongly recommend against Raja yoga for 99% of hu=\r\nmanity. Even Ramakrishna\nadvised against it. Controlling body and mind and =\r\nforcing the psychic life\nforce to purify and ascend requires strict yama an=\r\nd niyama and clean nadis. In\nthis age of polluted air, water and food, nadi=\r\ns accumulate great amounts of\nobstructions and Raja yoga can be dangerous. =\r\nThis is not just my view, but what\nRamakrishna explicitly taught in &quot;Gospel=\r\n of Ramakrishna&quot; (one of the\ngreatest spiritual texts IMHO). He discouraged=\r\n several of his sishyas from\npursuing Raja Yoga. He taught it to Vivekanand=\r\na, but did not encourage even him\nto practice it.&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\nJnana yoga=\r\n is brilliant, but there is a distinct danger of falling into the\ndelusiona=\r\nl trap of pseudo-wisdom. People of this age are not\nsincere/honest/smart en=\r\nough for it. It is easy to delude that &quot;all is Brahman.\nI am Brahman. Whate=\r\nver I do, it&#39;s ok - it doesn&#39;t matter. It&#39;s all a delusion\nanyway&quot; without =\r\nfully overcoming all innate conditioning that reinforces\nduality in conscio=\r\nusness every instant. Kind of like declaring wisely in a\nmovie that &quot;it&#39;s j=\r\nust a movie and not reality&quot;, but flinching in\nevery scary scene, crying in=\r\n every sad scene etc. Without absolute honesty,\nsincerely and earnestness, =\r\njnana yoga can be problematic too. A long path of\nconstant contemplation an=\r\nd self-correction can be reduced to a quick delusional\njump to the end.&lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\nIMHo, for most people in this age, Bhakti yoga and Karma yoga a=\r\nre the most\nsuitable and safest.&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\nBest regards,&lt;br&gt;\nNarasimha=\r\n&lt;br&gt;\n--------&lt;br&gt;\nAstrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollo=\r\nw&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.Ve=\r\ndicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n--------&lt;br&gt;\n&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\n--- In sohamsa@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, Vishnu Jandhyala &lt;jvishnu@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Dear =\r\nMs. Maja,&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Namaste&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; Now different type =\r\nof 4 yogas based on ayana/kendra:&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dharma ayana =\r\n- Gyana yoga- lagna and its trines&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Artha ayana - Karma yoga -=\r\n 10th bhava and its trines&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Kama ayana - Raja yoga- 7th bhava =\r\nand its trines&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Moksha ayana - Bhakti yoga - 4th bhava and its=\r\n trines&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; These 4 yogas are listed in Bhagavat Gi=\r\nta, you can check it, I assure&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; there are four of them.
