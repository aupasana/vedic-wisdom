Most others trim the branches. Sri Bhagavan\ntac=\r\nkled the root of the problem. He said that whatever be the gravity of the\ns=\r\nuffering, we are not aware of it in deep sleep. When we have a terrible\ntoo=\r\nthache, we can.t think of anything except the pain. But the pain is not\nfel=\r\nt in deep sleep. In deep sleep, we are not conscious of the body and\nhence =\r\nthere is no pain. When the mind merges in the Self, there is no\nbody-consci=\r\nousness and therefore there is no pain.Sri Bhagavan says:\n.Physical pain on=\r\nly follows body-consciousness. It cannot be in the absence\nof body-consciou=\r\nsness and pleasures.Pains are dependent on the ego; they\ncannot be without =\r\nthe .I. but the .I. can remain without them.\n\nEven ordinarily, we notice th=\r\nat our pain is related to the attitude of our\nmind. When we have some acute=\r\n pain, and a person we like walks in, our pain\nis relieved to some extent. =\r\nWhen a person we dislike walks in, our pain\nbecomes worse. In other words, =\r\nour pain increases or decreases according to\nthe state of our mind at a par=\r\nticular moment. Sri Bhagavan asks us to remove\nthe mind altogether so that =\r\nwe won.t feel the pain at all. He says:\n.Therefore turn inwards and seek th=\r\ne Self and there will be an end both of\nthe world and its miseries.. When b=\r\nody-consciousness goes, suffering\ngoes. Prayer\nis good in that it makes us =\r\nlose ourselves in the contemplation of the\nSupreme Being. When the mind is =\r\nlost in contemplation, there is considerable\nreduction in pain. But prayer =\r\nwill not remove suffering totally. The\nindividual will feel the suffering w=\r\nhen his mind is not at prayer. Puja,\njapa, and prayer are all good in that =\r\nthey take our mind off our suffering\nfor a while.\n\nWhile they are all good =\r\nas a temporary measure, removal of suffering is\npossible only through elimi=\r\nnation of body-consciousness. Sri Bhagavan says:\n.If one remains free from =\r\npain thus, there won.t be any pain anywhere. The\ntrouble now is due to your=\r\n seeing the world outside yourself and thinking\nthere is pain in it. But bo=\r\nth the world and the pain are within you; if you\nturn inward, there will be=\r\n no pain...\n\nTo the charge that those who eliminate suffering thus are self=\r\nish and do not\nworry about others, Sri Bhagavan says: .The world is not ext=\r\nernal to you.\nBecause you wrongly identify yourself with the body, you see =\r\nthe world\noutside you and its suffering becomes apparent to you; but the wo=\r\nrld and its\nsufferings are not real. Seek the reality and get rid of this u=\r\nnreal\nfeeling.. The understanding of oneself is the ending of suffering.The=\r\n\nquestion of selfishness doesn.t arise as in that state, only the Self will=\r\n\nbe seen in everybody and everything.\n\nBut Sri Bhagavan doesn.t say we shou=\r\nld be indifferent to the sufferings of\nothers. So long as we have body-cons=\r\nciousness, we shall be conscious of our\nsufferings and those of others and =\r\nwould be interested in removing them.\nCompassion is really .your pain in my=\r\n heart.. When we remove the sufferings\nof others, we become less .me.-cente=\r\nred. But in this way, we cannot remove\nall the pain in the world. As pain i=\r\ns dependent on the ego, Sri Bhagavan\nsuggests the removal of the ego; pain =\r\nwill also disappear.\n\nThis is not just theory. Sri Bhagavan exemplified wha=\r\nt he said. When he had\ncancer, he behaved as if it belonged to another. He =\r\nwas as serene as ever\nand gave darshan to all till the very end. There wasn=\r\n.t a trace of pain on\nhis face. His detachment from the body was total.\n\nSo=\r\nurce: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2007/?pg=3Dnov-dec\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=\r\n=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=\r\n=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=\r\n=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=\r\n=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=\r\n=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd6e78cd47bc40488cefddd\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\nWHENEVER Sri Bhagavan was asked about the problem of suffering, he suggeste=\r\nd a method to eliminate it.
