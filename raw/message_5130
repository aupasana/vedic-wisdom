Since the last 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away from internet for=\r\nums due to various reasons. It has been nearly a year since I interacted on=\r\n an internet forum. However after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the or=\r\niginal post with my write up to my inbox, I visited this forum and quickly =\r\nbrowsed through some posts. I am happy to note that the general atmosphere =\r\nhere is far better and more sincere than a lot of other forums. Having quic=\r\nkly browsed through this particular thread, I thought that I might reply to=\r\n Utpal ji&#39;s question.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an important\n question r=\r\negarding the necessity of initiation. I will address it after summarizing t=\r\nhe big picture that needs to be invoked in order to understand the ONE ques=\r\ntion and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the question a general or sp=\r\necific one? Generally speaking if the question is whether initiation is an =\r\nabsolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my* answer is- NO. How=\r\never if the question is about the necessity of being initiated for mantra s=\r\nadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=82=E2=80=93YES.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as the tantric adage goes; thereby the nec=\r\nessity for multiple approaches and multiple paths. Thus arises the inevitab=\r\nility of multiple perspectives. In the pan-Indian context there are many pa=\r\nths for sadhana. But in the current context of this question I will restric=\r\nt myself to only the five that are relevant to the discussion.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; a. =\r\nGnana marga\n (Advaitic/Vedantic)\n&gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)\n&gt; &gt; c=\r\n. Mantra marga (Tantric)\n&gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)\n&gt; &gt; e. Karma m=\r\narga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Spiritual life =\r\nis nothing but the practicalisation of the great abstract Truths of the Cos=\r\nmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES particular methods and techniques i=\r\nn its attempt to practicalise the abstract truths at an experiential level.=\r\n Let us briefly look at the predominant methods/ techniques employed by eac=\r\nh of these paths.\n&gt; &gt; For those who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Adv=\r\naita, strictly speaking even the external guru is not necessary, though one=\r\n can greatly benefit from the wisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. T=\r\nhe direct path of Advaita emphasises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) an=\r\nd Vichara (self-reflection). Advaita being essentially a culmination of the=\r\n Vaidik system it\n has retained the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular=\r\n self-study of texts) too as an important practice. All of these practices =\r\ninvolve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way with a marginal role for external practices=\r\n.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Yoga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent pract=\r\nice) and Vairagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga=\r\n additionally emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the S=\r\nupreme Iswara) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise on=\r\nly the first two as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Bhakti marga=\r\n (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s will throu=\r\ngh total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Karma ma=\r\nrga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in actions wit=\r\nhout attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the Gita.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally I will address\n the Tantric path of mantra sadhana where a=\r\nlone the inevitable necessity of initiation and thereby the necessity of a =\r\nGuru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicalization of certain occult=\r\n truths via the energetics of Sabda through the employment of Vak. It presu=\r\npposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experiment and thereby certain r=\r\negulations and safe practices. It should be remembered that except Bhakti m=\r\narga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various levels, while Bhakti predomi=\r\nnantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the age-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;).=\r\n Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/employs the fire of the=\r\n intellect, another the fire of speech, another the fire of austerity, and =\r\nyet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so on.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s me=\r\nthod of invoking fire deals with the fire of Vak through the lab-like pract=\r\nical mantrasastra. Since Tantra employs highly powerful techniques that bri=\r\nng\n results more quickly it lays great emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is no=\r\nt about authority but more about qualification. Would you allow a child to =\r\nexperiment with fire without any supervision? Does the supervisor need expe=\r\nrience and training or not? Like any other lab experiment proper training a=\r\nnd experience are part of the procedure apart from certain safety measures,=\r\n in the Tantric lab experiment too. However the lab is one&#39;s own consciousn=\r\ness whilst the experiment is awakening the Sakti within the individual cons=\r\nciousness (also referred to as Kundalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for=\r\n mere intellectualisation, I will refrain from further discussion on the Ku=\r\nndalini. Without going into other needless details here, I will just elabor=\r\nate on initiation and Guru parampara.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Since we are talking about S=\r\nri Sri Chandi, one has to contextualise it within the larger Tantric contex=\r\nt too. Sakti sadhana is one major river within the\n Tantric context. The Da=\r\nsha Maha Vidyas cover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. However th=\r\nere are actually three major schools that are full-fledged living tradition=\r\ns among the DashaMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi=\r\n sadhana belongs to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. J=\r\nust to make the picture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!=\r\n) have taken to Tarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I=\r\n will draw attention to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares=\r\n both the Advaitic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to=\r\n sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma is=\r\n not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least at=\r\n the major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mantra=\r\n, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of synchronist=\r\nic frequencies for each of\n these three lineages. Initiation is the full-fl=\r\nedged entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of that=\r\n path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with S=\r\nIVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-br=\r\nanches and twigs spread out progressively downward till the individual sadh=\r\naka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern met=\r\naphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric ad=\r\nvocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the con=\r\nduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautiful=\r\n bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where ther=\r\ne is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up ti=\r\nll Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabda)=\r\n. Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; As already stated Sakta sadhana seek=\r\ns\n to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness through an integrate=\r\nd approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana, Bhava, Japa and Ma=\r\nntra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highly comprehensive and =\r\nintegrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the many in the One. Sri=\r\n Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach. However it is also=\r\n a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanishads. It is also simu=\r\nltaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra. The question of in=\r\nitiation is relevant only to those following the Tantramarga and thus emplo=\r\nying the text as a mantramaya text . For those who explore the text as a yo=\r\ngasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I have covered extens=\r\nively in my write-up. For those who are already inclined to the Advaitic pa=\r\nth, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely powerful reflections =\r\nthrough its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel, the crowning\n glor=\r\ny in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself proclaims in full-f=\r\nledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a second, saying &quot;I alon=\r\ne exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?&quot; (10.5). Compare it=\r\n with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflect on the central tru=\r\nth of Advaita.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The reason I advised the non-initiate to read in En=\r\nglish or any other regional language is because understanding the meaning a=\r\nnd constant reflection are possible only when one repeatedly reads the text=\r\n in a language that they can fully follow. The main idea of the writeup is =\r\nto explore the text as an Advaitic and Yogic text too apart from its obviou=\r\ns status as Sacred myth. However Sri Sri Chandi is also equally regarded as=\r\n Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, especially the four hymns. In that regard =\r\nall the applications of Veda mantras or the Veda Samhita are equally possib=\r\nle with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the practice\n of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone wh=\r\no is acquainted with the original Vedic method will straightaway identify t=\r\nhat Yagnya is the central Vedic practice. In fact even the worship of the V=\r\nigraha in the Hindu temple is fully based on and DERIVED from a one on one =\r\nmapping of the Vedic Yagasala with the Hindu temple.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Just as some =\r\npractitioners do the Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in=\r\n accordance with the Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the Tant=\r\nric approach and do the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this particu=\r\nlar approach that needs initiation as per its own principles. Initiation is=\r\n not mandatory if one adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or th=\r\ne Yogic path of Abhyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of read=\r\ning the text devoutly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if=\r\n one is not inclined to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya.=\r\n One may benefit from\n any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. Ho=\r\nwever one has to bear in mind that the living and breathing traditions of b=\r\noth Kalikula as well as Srikula as practiced originally in various parts of=\r\n the subcontinent originally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the=\r\n importance of initiation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidy=\r\na.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any of the =\r\nmerthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswara=\r\npranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are al=\r\nl effective. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc.=\r\n, some of these methods are more suited relatively to different practitione=\r\nrs. One may progress through a combination of any of these methods in spiri=\r\ntual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA invol=\r\nves Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answer\n to =\r\nthe question has to be contextualised.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Finally one last word. Irre=\r\nspective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA are the most effec=\r\ntive methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-study of texts follow=\r\ned by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. This is best done in=\r\n a language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATSANGHA it is the F=\r\nIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the alternate method (=\r\nthough not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. It is Satsangha an=\r\nd satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress in spiritual life=\r\n. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtue of serving, lis=\r\ntening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and sants in his young=\r\ner days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a quantum leap in thei=\r\nr spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ramakrishna, Nivritt=\r\ninath and Matsyendranath respectively.\n&gt;\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; For those who complain abo=\r\nut the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I will just quote Swami Sivananda:\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complaint by householders nowadays that there are n=\r\no good Mahatmas. This is a lame excuse. The company of Sadhus is a question=\r\n of supply and demand. If there is a sincere demand, the supply will come a=\r\nt once. This is the inexorable law of nature. If you are really thirsty, yo=\r\nu will find your Master at your threshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky life, =\r\nyour mind is full of passion and unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit for =\r\nhigher divine life. You waste your time in idle gossiping and vain, worldly=\r\n talks. You have become a hopeless slave of passion, greed, and name and fa=\r\nme. And yet you complain: `I cannot get good Satsanga.&#39;... Make yourself a =\r\ndeserving Adhikari first. Then come to me. I shall take you to the lotus-fe=\r\net of blessed souls who will put you in the right path, guide you and eleva=\r\nte you to\n sublime heights. These &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are waiting to =\r\nget hold of the right type of aspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty. Real seeke=\r\nrs are few. If you bring a charge, &quot;There are no good Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas a=\r\nlso bring a serious charge, &quot;There are no real seekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UN=\r\nQUOTE\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; To a certain extent even this forum is an opportunity for Sa=\r\ntsangha. Conducted with the appropriate bhavana, this group too is a potent=\r\nial Satsangha though not comparable to the actual company of the great mast=\r\ners. By swadhyaya of Sri Sri Chandi as a yoga-vedantic text alongside a stu=\r\ndy of the lives of great Saktas such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by lis=\r\ntening and/or singing the uplifting kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, by c=\r\nonstant remembrance and reflection, by discernment of sat and asat, by genu=\r\nine and sincere discussions on a group such as this, one makes progress tru=\r\nly.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I may not interact regularly\n or reply at least for a while.

Because of thi=\r\ns ritual, god may give any material results or spiritual results and not ne=\r\ncessarily fulfil my desires. I will accept whatever god gives.

Similarly, a guru with s=\r\nome achievement in a mantra can transfer\n some of it to a disciple. However=\r\n, one without a rich father is still better off opening a bank account with=\r\n a zero balance and building it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard work. Similar=\r\nly, one not finding a guru can still do sadhana with famous mantras and bui=\r\nld one&#39;s own spiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate you (not as =\r\na formality, but truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just go ahe=\r\nad and do it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals are used for two pur=\r\nposes - (i) for getting specific material results and (ii) as tools of incr=\r\neasing surrender and making spiritual progress. In the case of (ii), initia=\r\ntion is not that important. But, in the case of (i), there are pitfalls and=\r\n a guru can prepare one sufficiently. One can get in trouble otherwise.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I said several times, there are very few people wh=\r\no can do (i) now-a-days. Nature has destabilized\n the whole system, for a r=\r\neason, as Kali progressed. I suggest doing mantras and rituals only for inc=\r\nreasing surrender, getting whatever material results god wants to give and =\r\nmaking spiritual progress. If one is meant to do rituals for begetting *spe=\r\ncific* material results (for oneself or others or society/universe in gener=\r\nal), Nature will make arrangements for one to get correct knowledge of such=\r\n rituals. But, as one starts, one should start with the attitude of (ii).\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritual=\r\n or any homam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desires,=\r\n but I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may give=\r\n any material results or spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my de=\r\nsires. I will accept whatever god gives. I want to increase my devotion and=\r\n surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is n=\r\not required.\n That attitude itself is an initiation!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Ge=\r\nntle deities give good results slowly, but there are fewer hiccups. Fierce =\r\ndeities give results fast, but there may be some hiccups. I gave this analo=\r\ngy earlier also. Imagine that a person is taking rotten fruits from a fruit=\r\n basket and throwing them in garbage and trying to retrieve one good fruit =\r\nfrom under them. If the person is gentle, one may do it gently and the spil=\r\nlage of rotten fruits on the floor will be minimal. If the person is aggres=\r\nsive, one may do it fast and there may be more spillage of rotten fruits on=\r\n the floor. But the good fruit stuck under the rotten fruits will be retrie=\r\nved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas is in a basket. The deity is tr=\r\nying to take bad fruits and throw them in garbage and give you a good fruit=\r\n to eat. There may be some spillage. A gentle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu =\r\nor Lakshmi may take more time to get out the good\n fruit, but the spillage =\r\nwill be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimh=\r\na may have more spillage, but the good fruit comes out faster.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; At the end, remember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations, but f=\r\nruits of your own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat each of=\r\n those rotten fruits before eating the good fruits!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Neverth=\r\neless, one unable to take some of the spillage of rotten fruits is better o=\r\nff avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with gentler deities.=\r\n If initiation if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a guru before star=\r\nting a practice. If you realize the above, you can start mantras without in=\r\nitiation. If some bad results occut, you have to realize that it is a fruit=\r\n of your own actions and the deity is trying to accelerate good results. If=\r\n you are weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.\n&gt;\n &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some =\r\npeople who never lit a lamp in their life and were ignorant of rituals, are=\r\n doing daily homam now. Some people who took several hours to read Saptasha=\r\nti for the first time just 2-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam with e=\r\nntire saptashati everyday. I know that some of them have transformed a lot =\r\nand have experienced some things too. Obviously, they have done sadhana wit=\r\nh fire and sadhana of the Fierce aspects of Divine Mother in some past live=\r\ns.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank materialism, if so=\r\nmeone has even a faint idea that spiritual progress is important, is lookin=\r\ng for god and is attracted to a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipath)=\r\n, that person obviously has some good karmas and good vasanas. That person =\r\nhas done that sadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;s =\r\nadhikara.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If\n you have a good understanding of what is =\r\nwhat, how things work, why one should do something, how to do it, what is m=\r\nore important and what is less important, that is what initiation is all ab=\r\nout!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------=\r\n-------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, =\r\nFree Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual man=\r\nuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.=\r\norg\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------=\r\n-------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- vedi=\r\nc_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; It is my personal opinion that Strong and long standing urge should be co=\r\nnsidered as Initiation at least in this age.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I know a person who =\r\nwanted to recite Chandi paatha regularly but was not able to almost for a y=\r\near.

Infact, There are several people clos=\r\ne to me have started reciting Chandi in regional lagnuages as suggested by =\r\nme. hence practically, its the same as you suggested. However i feel that a=\r\nt some point its better to be able to recite Sanskrit verses.&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;You=\r\n have already written a very detailed account wherein i got some informatio=\r\nns which i never knew.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Only one opinion i wish to know from you is a=\r\nbout &quot;Satsanga&quot;. you have given the prime importance to that over everythin=\r\ng else.&lt;br&gt;Narasimha Garu has few times repeated that &quot;Pavaka&quot; is a yogi an=\r\nd living god. when one does Homam everyday,\n He/she actually gets a very ef=\r\nfective Satsanga with a Yogi called Agni-The Pavaka.&lt;br&gt;In that sense, Homa=\r\nm is also a ritual which automatically provides you with much required Sats=\r\nanga as well.

Since the last 4-5 years I have preferred to stay away from internet f=\r\norums due to various reasons. It has been nearly a year since I interacted =\r\non an internet forum. However after Narasimha garu forwarded a copy of the =\r\noriginal post with my write up to my inbox, I visited this forum and quickl=\r\ny browsed through some posts. I am happy to note that the general atmospher=\r\ne here is far better and more sincere than a lot of other forums. Having qu=\r\nickly browsed through this particular thread, I thought that I might reply =\r\nto Utpal ji&#39;s question.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Utpal ji has raised an i=\r\nmportant\n question regarding the necessity of initiation. I will address it=\r\n after summarizing the big picture that needs to be invoked in order to und=\r\nerstand the ONE question and the MANY answers possible. Firstly is the ques=\r\ntion a general or specific one? Generally speaking if the question is wheth=\r\ner initiation is an absolute requirement for spiritual life or sadhana, *my=\r\n* answer is- NO. However if the question is about the necessity of being in=\r\nitiated for mantra sadhana as enjoined by *Tantra marga*, the answer is =C3=\r\n=82=E2=80=93YES.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &#39;Munde munde matir bhinna&#39; as t=\r\nhe tantric adage goes; thereby the necessity for multiple approaches and mu=\r\nltiple paths. Thus arises the inevitability of multiple perspectives. In th=\r\ne pan-Indian context there are many paths for sadhana. But in the current c=\r\nontext of this question I will restrict myself to only the five that are re=\r\nlevant to the discussion.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; a. Gnana marga\n (Advai=\r\ntic/Vedantic)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; b. Yoga marga (Psycho-spiritual)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; c.=\r\n Mantra marga (Tantric)&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; d. Bhakti marga (Love/Devotion)&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; e. Karma marga (Action- Ritual path and/or Selfless Actions)&lt;br&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Spiritual life is nothing but the practicalisation of t=\r\nhe great abstract Truths of the Cosmos. Each of the above paths EMPHASISES =\r\nparticular methods and techniques in its attempt to practicalise the abstra=\r\nct truths at an experiential level. Let us briefly look at the predominant =\r\nmethods/ techniques employed by each of these paths.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; For those=\r\n who are predominantly oriented to Gnana/Advaita, strictly speaking even th=\r\ne external guru is not necessary, though one can greatly benefit from the w=\r\nisdom and experience of a genuine teacher. The direct path of Advaita empha=\r\nsises the methods of Viveka (Discernment) and Vichara (self-reflection). Ad=\r\nvaita being essentially a culmination of the Vaidik system it\n has retained=\r\n the vaidik practice of &#39;Swadhyaya&#39; (regular self-study of texts) too as an=\r\n important practice. All of these practices involve the &#39;self&#39; in a big way=\r\n with a marginal role for external practices.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Yo=\r\nga marga emphasises Abhyasa (self-coaching by consistent practice) and Vair=\r\nagya (Non-reactivity or Non-attachment). Hindu schools of Yoga additionally=\r\n emphasise &#39;Iswarapranidhana&#39; (orienting oneself towards the Supreme Iswara=\r\n) too while Bauddha and Jina schools of Yogamarga emphasise only the first =\r\ntwo as they subscribe to nirishwaravada.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Bhakti =\r\nmarga (Love/Devotion) emphasises unconditional acceptance of Iswara&#39;s will =\r\nthrough total surrender to the Supreme. On the contrary the emphasis in Kar=\r\nma marga is on Action as advocated by the Bhagavad Gita. Engaging in action=\r\ns without attachment to the results is the mainstay of Karma marga of the G=\r\nita.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Finally I will address\n the Tantric path of=\r\n mantra sadhana where alone the inevitable necessity of initiation and ther=\r\neby the necessity of a Guru arises. Mantra sadhana involves the practicaliz=\r\nation of certain occult truths via the energetics of Sabda through the empl=\r\noyment of Vak. It presupposes certain dangers inherent to any lab experimen=\r\nt and thereby certain regulations and safe practices. It should be remember=\r\ned that except Bhakti marga most paths invoke Fire or Agni at various level=\r\ns, while Bhakti predominantly invokes Soma (the reference here is to the ag=\r\ne-old `Agni-Someeyam&#39;). Among the paths that invoke Agni, one path invokes/=\r\nemploys the fire of the intellect, another the fire of speech, another the =\r\nfire of austerity, and yet another the physical fire of the Yagnya and so o=\r\nn.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Tantra&#39;s method of invoking fire deals with t=\r\nhe fire of Vak through the lab-like practical mantrasastra. Since Tantra em=\r\nploys highly powerful techniques that bring\n results more quickly it lays g=\r\nreat emphasis on adhikara. Adhikara is not about authority but more about q=\r\nualification. Would you allow a child to experiment with fire without any s=\r\nupervision? Does the supervisor need experience and training or not? Like a=\r\nny other lab experiment proper training and experience are part of the proc=\r\nedure apart from certain safety measures, in the Tantric lab experiment too=\r\n. However the lab is one&#39;s own consciousness whilst the experiment is awake=\r\nning the Sakti within the individual consciousness (also referred to as Kun=\r\ndalini Sakti). As this is not a topic for mere intellectualisation, I will =\r\nrefrain from further discussion on the Kundalini. Without going into other =\r\nneedless details here, I will just elaborate on initiation and Guru parampa=\r\nra.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Since we are talking about Sri Sri Chandi, o=\r\nne has to contextualise it within the larger Tantric context too. Sakti sad=\r\nhana is one major river within the\n Tantric context. The Dasha Maha Vidyas =\r\ncover the entire Sakta sadhanas comprehensively. However there are actually=\r\n three major schools that are full-fledged living traditions among the Dash=\r\naMahaVidyas- Kalikula, Srikula and Tarakula. Sri Sri Chandi sadhana belongs=\r\n to Kalikula whilst Sri Vidya sadhana belongs to Srikula. Just to make the =\r\npicture more complete the Vajrayanas among the Buddhists (!) have taken to =\r\nTarakula. To those who are familiar with Tibetan Buddhism I will draw atten=\r\ntion to the the 21 forms of Sri Tara Devi. Vajrayana shares both the Advait=\r\nic outlook as well as the Sakta sadhanas in its approach to sadhana.&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Kali kula *predominantly* invokes Agni (not that Soma =\r\nis not invoked at all) while Sri kula predominantly invokes Soma, at least =\r\nat the major milestones in the internal spiritual journey. The yantra, mant=\r\nra, bija, devata, etc are all consistently of a particular set of synchroni=\r\nstic frequencies for each of\n these three lineages. Initiation is the full-=\r\nfledged entry of the practitioner into a particular spiritual lineage of th=\r\nat path (kula). The Guru parampara can be compared to an INVERTED TREE with=\r\n SIVA himself at the root from where the trunk arises. Each branch and sub-=\r\nbranches and twigs spread out progressively downward till the individual sa=\r\ndhaka. It is a beautiful metaphor if you can visualise it. Another modern m=\r\netaphor that one can use is that of electricity. It is held by the Tantric =\r\nadvocate that initiation not only completes the circuit necessary for the c=\r\nonduit of electricity but also prevents short circuit. Imagine many beautif=\r\nul bulbs/lights at each point in this inverted tree of live wires, where th=\r\nere is a long series of sadhakas sitting in silent practice all the way up =\r\ntill Siva himself. It is a dynamic world of Light (Prakasa) and Sound (Sabd=\r\na). Now back to Sri Sri Chandi.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; As already state=\r\nd Sakta sadhana seeks\n to awaken Sakti within the individual consciousness =\r\nthrough an integrated approach that combines the practices of Gnana, Dhyana=\r\n, Bhava, Japa and Mantra. Both Kalikula and Srikula have evolved into highl=\r\ny comprehensive and integrated approaches that can simultaneously hold the =\r\nmany in the One. Sri Sri Chandi seemingly starts with the Pauranic approach=\r\n. However it is also a full-fledged Advaitic/Vedantic text like the Upanish=\r\nads. It is also simultaneously a text on Yogasastra as well as Mantrasastra=\r\n. The question of initiation is relevant only to those following the Tantra=\r\nmarga and thus employing the text as a mantramaya text . For those who expl=\r\nore the text as a yogasastra, the esoteric meaning is more relevant which I=\r\n have covered extensively in my write-up. For those who are already incline=\r\nd to the Advaitic path, Sri Sri Chandi provides the context for immensely p=\r\nowerful reflections through its central message of Oneness. The crest jewel=\r\n, the crowning\n glory in the text is the Mahavakya wherein the Devi Herself=\r\n proclaims in full-fledged Upanishadic fashion that She is one without a se=\r\ncond, saying &quot;I alone exist in this universe. Who else is there besides me?=\r\n&quot; (10.5). Compare it with the other Mahavakyas of the Upanishads and reflec=\r\nt on the central truth of Advaita.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The reason I =\r\nadvised the non-initiate to read in English or any other regional language =\r\nis because understanding the meaning and constant reflection are possible o=\r\nnly when one repeatedly reads the text in a language that they can fully fo=\r\nllow. The main idea of the writeup is to explore the text as an Advaitic an=\r\nd Yogic text too apart from its obvious status as Sacred myth. However Sri =\r\nSri Chandi is also equally regarded as Sruti just as the Veda Samhita, espe=\r\ncially the four hymns. In that regard all the applications of Veda mantras =\r\nor the Veda Samhita are equally possible with Sri Sri Chandi and hence the =\r\npractice\n of Chandi *HOMAM*. Anyone who is acquainted with the original Ved=\r\nic method will straightaway identify that Yagnya is the central Vedic pract=\r\nice. In fact even the worship of the Vigraha in the Hindu temple is fully b=\r\nased on and DERIVED from a one on one mapping of the Vedic Yagasala with th=\r\ne Hindu temple.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Just as some practitioners do th=\r\ne Homam as an integral part of Sri Sri Chandi sadhana in accordance with th=\r\ne Vedic approach, there are those who adhere to the Tantric approach and do=\r\n the sadhana as per the mantra marga. It is this particular approach that n=\r\needs initiation as per its own principles. Initiation is not mandatory if o=\r\nne adopts the Vedantic path of Viveka and Vichara, or the Yogic path of Abh=\r\nyasa and Vairagya, or even the Pauranic approach of reading the text devout=\r\nly as Sacred Myth. Likewise Homam too is not required if one is not incline=\r\nd to the predominantly Vaidik practice of Ritual/Yagnya. One may benefit fr=\r\nom\n any or all of these approaches to Sri Sri Chandi. However one has to be=\r\nar in mind that the living and breathing traditions of both Kalikula as wel=\r\nl as Srikula as practiced originally in various parts of the subcontinent o=\r\nriginally trace themselves to Tantra marga and hence the importance of init=\r\niation for those paths, be it Sri Sri Chandi or Sri Vidya.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In summary, one can make spiritual progress through any of the m=\r\nerthods/practices using Sri Sri Chandi. Swadhyaya, Viveka, Vichara, Iswarap=\r\nranidhana, Abhyasa, Vairagya, Nimitta bhava, Sakshi bhava, Homa etc are all=\r\n effective. However depending on the individual temperament, aptitude etc.,=\r\n some of these methods are more suited relatively to different practitioner=\r\ns. One may progress through a combination of any of these methods in spirit=\r\nual life. However the *full-fledged* integrated approach of KALIKULA involv=\r\nes Mantra diksha too. It is this big picture against which the answer\n to t=\r\nhe question has to be contextualised.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Finally on=\r\ne last word. Irrespective of the method and path, SWADHYAYA and SATSANGHA a=\r\nre the most effective methods for all of us. Swadhyaya is regular self-stud=\r\ny of texts followed by reflection on the truths expounded in the texts. Thi=\r\ns is best done in a language that one is fully conversant with. As for SATS=\r\nANGHA it is the FIRST AND BEST choice among all methods. Swadhyaya is the a=\r\nlternate method (though not as powerful) where Satsangha is not possible. I=\r\nt is Satsangha and satsangha alone that enables one to make rapid progress =\r\nin spiritual life. Sri Ramakrishna attained the rare exalted state by virtu=\r\ne of serving, listening to and spending time in the company of sadhus and s=\r\nants in his younger days. Vivekananda , Jnanadeva and Gorakhnath made a qua=\r\nntum leap in their spiritual lives after they attended the Satsangha of Ram=\r\nakrishna, Nivrittinath and Matsyendranath respectively.&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; For those who complain about the scarcity of Satsangha nowadays, I=\r\n will just quote Swami Sivananda:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; QUOTE // &quot;There is a complai=\r\nnt by householders nowadays that there are no good Mahatmas. This is a lame=\r\n excuse. The company of Sadhus is a question of supply and demand. If there=\r\n is a sincere demand, the supply will come at once. This is the inexorable =\r\nlaw of nature. If you are really thirsty, you will find your Master at your=\r\n threshold. You lead a happy-go-lucky life, your mind is full of passion an=\r\nd unholy Vasanas. You do not care a bit for higher divine life. You waste y=\r\nour time in idle gossiping and vain, worldly talks. You have become a hopel=\r\ness slave of passion, greed, and name and fame. And yet you complain: `I ca=\r\nnnot get good Satsanga.&#39;... Make yourself a deserving Adhikari first. Then =\r\ncome to me. I shall take you to the lotus-feet of blessed souls who will pu=\r\nt you in the right path, guide you and elevate you to\n sublime heights. The=\r\nse &quot;oversouls&quot; or high souls are waiting to get hold of the right type of a=\r\nspirants. Mahatmas are in plenty. Real seekers are few. If you bring a char=\r\nge, &quot;There are no good Mahatmas.&quot; Mahatmas also bring a serious charge, &quot;Th=\r\nere are no real seekers after Truth.&quot;.&quot; //UNQUOTE&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; To a certain extent even this forum is an opportunity for Satsangha. Cond=\r\nucted with the appropriate bhavana, this group too is a potential Satsangha=\r\n though not comparable to the actual company of the great masters. By swadh=\r\nyaya of Sri Sri Chandi as a yoga-vedantic text alongside a study of the liv=\r\nes of great Saktas such as Sri Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, by listening and/or=\r\n singing the uplifting kirtans/chants lauding the Mother, by constant remem=\r\nbrance and reflection, by discernment of sat and asat, by genuine and since=\r\nre discussions on a group such as this, one makes progress truly.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I may not interact regularly\n or reply at least for a whi=\r\nle. However I might participate in some discussions on and off.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Satya Prakash&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; --- In &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://us.mc560.ma=\r\nil.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@y=\r\nahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste everybody,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; I read this message of respected Narasimha Garu few times.

Similarly, a guru with some achieveme=\r\nnt in a mantra can transfer\n some of it to a disciple. However, one without=\r\n a rich father is still better off opening a bank account with a zero balan=\r\nce and building it up slowly with one&#39;s own hard work. Similarly, one not f=\r\ninding a guru can still do sadhana with famous mantras and build one&#39;s own =\r\nspiritual account. If you find a guru to initiate you (not as a formality, =\r\nbut truly initiate you), get initiated. Otherwise, just go ahead and do it.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (2b) Mantras and rituals are=\r\n used for two purposes - (i) for getting specific material results and (ii)=\r\n as tools of increasing surrender and making spiritual progress. In the cas=\r\ne of (ii), initiation is not that important. But, in the case of (i), there=\r\n are pitfalls and a guru can prepare one sufficiently. One can get in troub=\r\nle otherwise.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, as I s=\r\naid several times, there are very few people who can do (i) now-a-days. Nat=\r\nure has destabilized\n the whole system, for a reason, as Kali progressed. I=\r\n suggest doing mantras and rituals only for increasing surrender, getting w=\r\nhatever material results god wants to give and making spiritual progress. I=\r\nf one is meant to do rituals for begetting *specific* material results (for=\r\n oneself or others or society/universe in general), Nature will make arrang=\r\nements for one to get correct knowledge of such rituals. But, as one starts=\r\n, one should start with the attitude of (ii).&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; (3) If you want to do Chandipath or any mantra or any ritu=\r\nal or any homam, do it with the attitude of &quot;I have several material desire=\r\ns, but I do not know how to fulfil them. Because of this ritual, god may gi=\r\nve any material results or spiritual results and not necessarily fulfil my =\r\ndesires. I will accept whatever god gives. I want to increase my devotion a=\r\nnd surrender and make spiritual progress&quot;. You are then SAFE. Initiation is=\r\n not required.\n That attitude itself is an initiation!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (4) Gentle deities give good results slowly, but =\r\nthere are fewer hiccups. Fierce deities give results fast, but there may be=\r\n some hiccups. I gave this analogy earlier also. Imagine that a person is t=\r\naking rotten fruits from a fruit basket and throwing them in garbage and tr=\r\nying to retrieve one good fruit from under them. If the person is gentle, o=\r\nne may do it gently and the spillage of rotten fruits on the floor will be =\r\nminimal. If the person is aggressive, one may do it fast and there may be m=\r\nore spillage of rotten fruits on the floor. But the good fruit stuck under =\r\nthe rotten fruits will be retrieved faster. Similarly, phala of your karmas=\r\n is in a basket. The deity is trying to take bad fruits and throw them in g=\r\narbage and give you a good fruit to eat. There may be some spillage. A gent=\r\nle deity like Ganapathi, Vishnu or Lakshmi may take more time to get out th=\r\ne good\n fruit, but the spillage will be minimal. A fierce deity like Chandi=\r\n or Bhairava or Kali or Narasimha may have more spillage, but the good frui=\r\nt comes out faster.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; At the en=\r\nd, remember that these fruits are not deity&#39;s creations, but fruits of your=\r\n own actions. Without sadhana, you would&#39;ve had to eat each of those rotten=\r\n fruits before eating the good fruits!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Nevertheless, one unable to take some of the spillage of rotten f=\r\nruits is better off avoiding fierce deities such as Chandi and staying with=\r\n gentler deities. If initiation if made mandatory, one can be assessed by a=\r\n guru before starting a practice. If you realize the above, you can start m=\r\nantras without initiation. If some bad results occut, you have to realize t=\r\nhat it is a fruit of your own actions and the deity is trying to accelerate=\r\n good results. If you are weak-hearted, stick to gentler deities.&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (5) Some people who never lit a lamp =\r\nin their life and were ignorant of rituals, are doing daily homam now. Some=\r\n people who took several hours to read Saptashati for the first time just 2=\r\n-3 years back are now doing Chandi homam with entire saptashati everyday. I=\r\n know that some of them have transformed a lot and have experienced some th=\r\nings too. Obviously, they have done sadhana with fire and sadhana of the Fi=\r\nerce aspects of Divine Mother in some past lives.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (6) In this age of ignorance and rank materialism, if =\r\nsomeone has even a faint idea that spiritual progress is important, is look=\r\ning for god and is attracted to a specific advanced sadhana (e.g. Chandipat=\r\nh), that person obviously has some good karmas and good vasanas. That perso=\r\nn has done that sadhana in the past. Previous life&#39;s sadhana itself is one&#39;=\r\ns adhikara.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; (7) If\n you have =\r\na good understanding of what is what, how things work, why one should do so=\r\nmething, how to do it, what is more important and what is less important, t=\r\nhat is what initiation is all about!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; &gt; Best regards&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; ----------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pit=\r\nri Tarpana:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/a&gt;&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; tar=\r\nget=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://saraswatifilms.org/&quot;&gt;http://SaraswatiFilms.or=\r\ng&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_b=\r\nlank&quot;\n href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot;&gt;http://groups.ya=\r\nhoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---------------------=\r\n-------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; ---- vedic_pathak &lt;vedic_pathak@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Dear Rajarshi,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; It is my personal opinion that Strong and long standing urge should be=\r\n considered as Initiation at least in this age.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n I know a person who wanted to recite Chandi paatha regularly but was not a=\r\nble to almost for a year.
