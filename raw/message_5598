It represents ParaBrahma. Other beejas like those in navarna mantra are saguna beejas and they represent combinations of specific qualities. Adding Om at the beginning of a mantra is like thinking of ParaBrahma and then thinking of a specific deity or form in relation to ParaBrahma. In tradition, Om is invariably added at the beginning of every mantra, if it is not already there.\n \nWhen you think of a specific form such as Mahakali or Sri Rama or Narasimha or Saraswati or Tara or Dakshinamurthy etc, it is possible to see them as forms representing certain qualities or as forms emanating from ParaBrahma and representing certain qualities. Thinking of ParaBrahma will keep the notion that &quot;all is Brahman&quot;, which is the corner stone of Self-knowledge, as a part of one&#39;s sadhana.\n \nSome people actually consider it &quot;risky&quot; to do mantras starting with other beejas and add Om. This is basically like making Self-knowledge the fundamental goal of sadhana and remembering it always, so that you do not risk getting swayed by other goals (like specific abilities, siddhis etc).\n \nAs for navarna mantra, one can do it with or without Om. Both are fine. But do ponder on the above and do what you find appropriate. Both are meaningful and both affect one&#39;s consciousness positively.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                  http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n  Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, gopal narayan &lt;gopalnarayan123@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; jai gurudev\n&gt; \n&gt; om shivgoraksh\n&gt; \n&gt; if u add om it becomes dashakshari [ 10 letters ].\n&gt; \n&gt; without om its navarna mantra [ 9 letter ]\n&gt; \n&gt; om shakti\n&gt; \n&gt; gopal\n&gt; \n&gt; On Thu, Jan 6, 2011 at 1:18 PM, Gaurav Kapur &lt;groovyacharya@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narashimhaji\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I have a query regarding the Navarna Mantra in chandi path.

Because as per my\n&gt; &gt; understanding the mantra wont be Navarna anymore once we add Om to it.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Please advise\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Gaurav\n\n\n"}}
