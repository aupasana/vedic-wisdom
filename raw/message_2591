Seeing that, Bhagavan said, =93We ha=\r\nve to protect them\nfrom cats, etc., is it not? Who will look after them? A =\r\ncage is required,\nfood must be given. Who will do all that here? It is bett=\r\ner for him to take\nthem away.=94\n\nThe devotee said he would make all the re=\r\nquired arrangements and requested\nthat they should be kept in the Ashram. H=\r\ne placed the pair of pigeons in\nBhagavan=92s lap.\n\nWith overflowing affecti=\r\non and love, Bhagavan drew them near him, saying,\n=93Come dears! Come! You =\r\nwon=92t go back? You wish to stay on here? All right,\nstay on; a cage will =\r\nbe coming.=94 As he thus petted them with affection, they\nbecame absolutely=\r\n quiet, closed their eyes as if they were in samadhi,and\nstayed on there wi=\r\nthout moving this way or that.Bhagavan thereupon keeping\nthem on his lap st=\r\nopped petting them, and with his gracious eyes fixed on\nthem, sat in silenc=\r\ne, deeply immersed in samadhi.\n\nIt took nearly an hour for the devotees in =\r\nthe Ashram to find and bring a\ncage for them. The wonder of it is, all thro=\r\nugh that one hour, the pigeons\nsat in Bhagavan=92s lap without moving one w=\r\nay or the other as if they were a\npair of yogis in samadhi. What could we s=\r\nay about their good fortune? Is it\nnot the result of their punya in previou=\r\ns births that this great sage should\nseat them on his lap, cajole them by p=\r\natting them from the head down to the\nfeet with his\nhands, bless them and t=\r\nhereby bestow on them divine bliss?\n\nNot only that, when the cage was broug=\r\nht in, Bhagavan patted them cajolingly\nand put them in the cage, saying,=93=\r\nPlease go in.
