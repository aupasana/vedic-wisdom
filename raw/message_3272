But, o=\r\nne who spent time with the necklace and is amazed and dazzled by the elabor=\r\nate work in it may consider it *the best*. If you ask &quot;what about the *root=\r\n* of this, i.e. the original gold used to make the necklace&quot;, he may not be=\r\n impressed.\n=C2=A0\nIn fact, he may even tell you that one can melt the neck=\r\nlace and create the &quot;root&quot; gold from it and create other golden objects (ba=\r\nngle, arrow etc) from it. So, from his perspective, the golden necklace is =\r\nthe best golden object and every golden object can be created from it.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nOf course, one who is equally amazed by the golden arrow may say the sa=\r\nme thing about the arrow!\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nFor Lord Hanuman, =\r\nRama was everything.

Lord Rama was the supreme god a=\r\nnd source of all, in Hanuman&#39;s eyes.\n=C2=A0\nAnnamayya had exactly the same =\r\nattitude regarding Lord Venkateswara (Balaji).

The field of duality has scope for really complic=\r\nated versions of reality. As I said, it is a matter of reference frame. Com=\r\npared to the reference frame experienced by the minds of normal persons stu=\r\nck deeply in maayaa, reference frames of great yogis and saints who overcam=\r\ne most layers of maayaa give a better and larger view of the field of duali=\r\nty.

It is understandable if h=\r\ne says Rama is an ideal man but hard to believe that such a great person cl=\r\naims Rama is not God. Tempted to ask him what really is the definition of G=\r\nod which differentiates Rama from Krishna?\n\n\nSome months back I had a very =\r\nlengthy, verbose and charged/heated debate with him on whether Sri Rama is =\r\nGod or not. Mind you, these are all theoritical/ theological debates - noth=\r\ning to do with actual spirituality. Finally he stopped the debate because I=\r\n was getting agitated and it would have affected our friendship. \n\n=C2=A0\nW=\r\nhenever his opinion is asked on anything, he will only mention that what he=\r\n can support using logic. Therefore he never generally discusses spirituali=\r\nty with anyone per se. He will discuss and debate scriptures using exact qu=\r\notations etc, (theology)=C2=A0but not about mysticism or sadhana or anythin=\r\ng which=C2=A0needs a belief system. That is why most people know him only a=\r\ns a very rational, massively knowledgeable and uncorruptable=C2=A0 human be=\r\ning.=C2=A0=C2=A0They have no clue about his meditations or anything. He nev=\r\ner projects himself as spiritual and generally would not discuss God in pub=\r\nlic.\n\n=C2=A0\nTherefore our discussion was also on those aspects which can b=\r\ne proved or disproved theologically=C2=A0 - 1) Is Rama a God as per Valmiki=\r\n Ramayana=C2=A0 2) Is it wrong if people consider him as God=C2=A0.. 3) The=\r\n merits of the Ramcharit Manas of Tulasidasji.\n\n=C2=A0\n1) To the first ques=\r\ntion, he believes the answer is &quot;no&quot;. \n=C2=A0\n2) To the second question he =\r\nsays it cannot be debated from a spiritual point if it is right or wrong=C2=\r\n=A0- but his personal opinion is that one should try to follow the way of l=\r\nife shown by Sri Rama rather than worshipping him. He said, Sri Rama had ma=\r\nstery of all divine weapons. He could have destroyed Ravana and his whole a=\r\nrmy in a blink of an eye, right from the place where he was=C2=A0located wh=\r\nen he first heard the news of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama did not do so and =\r\ninstead chose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the human way. So as per =\r\nmy friend, it is more important to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas than to worship Ram=\r\na.\n\n=C2=A0\n3) He considers the Ramcharit Manas, from a literary angle, a ho=\r\ndgepodge of langauges and styles ranging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An autho=\r\nr&#39;s paradise (since many rules of composition has been flouted) but a criti=\r\ncs nightmare. Also, there is a line in there which equates women with anima=\r\nls or something similar. He believes that was introduces in the text becaus=\r\ne Tulasidas had a problem controlling his own lust. Therefore, he ended up =\r\ncomposing a sentence derogatory to women. Further, he argues that if Sri Ra=\r\nma is worshipped as God, then the purpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri=\r\n Rama was there to explain idea way of life. Krishna was there to be worshi=\r\npped because Krishna was maximum ability of God on this plane. Nothing can =\r\nbe more God than Krishna was on this plane, so he thinks.\n\n=C2=A0\nThe above=\r\n are merely his opinions, feel free to disagree. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nDear Utpal,=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nOne request, if you can speak to him about his thought on Food habi=\r\nts, it&#39;ll be great.\n=C2=A0\nI have been out of touch with him since August, =\r\nbeen busy myself. But will ask him. However I don&#39;t know whether he will re=\r\nspond. Because as I explained above, he rarely discusses/debates anything f=\r\nrom a purely spiritual angle. \n\n=C2=A0\nIt was only by chance that I found o=\r\nut one day about his meditations etc and then he confirmed them when asked.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\nI have seen him debating with Vegans - purely from a scientific poi=\r\nnt of view - about why there is no harm in having regulated amounts of meat=\r\n (not red meat). \n=C2=A0\nBut I say, as Narasimha said, this person should n=\r\not be taken as an ideal regarding food=C2=A0 habits. Sachin can bat and sco=\r\nre century even with a sore back, we will not be able to do it.

He is married, lives in Delhi and has a son as well.\n=C2=A0\nBefore I te=\r\nll you anything more=C2=A0about his spiritual life=C2=A0that I know, let me=\r\n say=C2=A0line or two about the nature of this friend of mine. I met him ab=\r\nout two years back. What first attracted me to=C2=A0 towards him was his im=\r\npeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac=C2=A0when it comes to=C2=A0honest=\r\nly.=C2=A0If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to just say a=\r\n simple, harmless=C2=A0lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not say it=\r\n. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually never ever=C2=\r\n=A0spoken even a single lie in his whole life, big or small. When he was in=\r\n his school, once his teacher told him that Indian languages are richer tha=\r\nn English, he believed his teacher. Later someone else told him English is =\r\nmore comprehensive language and the world cannot do with it. He got confuse=\r\nd. Since that day, he bought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one Englis=\r\nh, one Hindi and for ten years every day he spend one\n hour reading the Eng=\r\nlish dictionary and one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from readin=\r\ng=C2=A0up volumes of Hindi and English literature.=C2=A0When I asked him wh=\r\ny, he just said it is because he wanted to be=C2=A0equally adept at both th=\r\ne languages so that one day he can take a really detached view to judge the=\r\n truth about=C2=A0which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he has a=\r\nn uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anyt=\r\nhing. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different =\r\nfields, from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long i=\r\nn most places. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu=\r\n, Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes =\r\npoetry in all the above languages. When he was in college, he considered hi=\r\nmself an atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered fo=\r\nr religion as blank. When the clerk who was\n supposed to take the forms saw=\r\n that blank space, he asked my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the cle=\r\nrk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk a=\r\nnd tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and wr=\r\niting Hindu in the form would have been a lie. \n\n=C2=A0\nSo this gives a bas=\r\nic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friends, whoever knows him, ca=\r\nlls him Rama of Kaliyuga.\n=C2=A0\nOne day, long back, he was going to office=\r\n for some urgent meeting. His way to office passed by a Krishna temple. As =\r\nhe was passing by in=C2=A0his scooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to g=\r\no into the temple. He says he still does not know why he went inside the te=\r\nmple, but he did. That was at 9 o clock in the morning. Next when he sees h=\r\nis watch it is 4:30 in the evening! And he has no knowledge of how the time=\r\n went. When he asked the priest, the priest said that he went into the temp=\r\nle sat down and just stayed as he was for the whole time without any moveme=\r\nnt. The priest somehow felt scared to disturb him. But my friend had no ide=\r\na why this happened. He remembered nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.\n\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nThen he started meditating at home, and it was there=C2=A0that he go=\r\nt visions etc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most peo=\r\nple who know him also do not know these things. But once he was in samadhi =\r\nfor 72 hours, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same place =\r\nand same position for 3 days continuously.=C2=A0 Only his wife and close re=\r\nlatives know about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for =\r\nmeditation he often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how=\r\n he felt during samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe org=\r\ninates from me. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals=\r\n, men, women, children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the at=\r\nom and bigger than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.=C2=A0He co=\r\nnsiders Sri Krishna to be God and=C2=A0Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That i=\r\ns why he does not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it\n elevated =\r\nSri=C2=A0Rama to the level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki =\r\nRamayana was to show Sri Rama as an ideal man,=C2=A0not a God.The differenc=\r\ne he says is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary=\r\n man can and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emula=\r\nted by ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one=C2=A0can try to lea=\r\nd his life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely sta=\r\nting his idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and ad=\r\nvises people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not=\r\n an atheist any more.\n\n=C2=A0\nLater he had once=C2=A0mentioned he knew the =\r\nrelation he had with all the people around him in his past lives. His mothe=\r\nr he says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays he spends a lot =\r\nof time on different internet forums interacting with people, specially=C2=\r\n=A0with those in=C2=A0the age group of 18 to 30, discussing anything and ev=\r\nerything with them, from Indian politics to Indian history, religion, etc e=\r\ntc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young people who will be the f=\r\nuture of this country.\n\n=C2=A0\nHe is am omnivorous person.

Let me start off with =\r\na simple analogy.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;A golden necklace, a golden bangle, a golden=\r\n ring, a golden arrow and a golden plate may all be made of gold. But, one =\r\nwho spent time with the necklace and is amazed and dazzled by the elaborate=\r\n work in it may consider it *the best*. If you ask &quot;what about the *root* o=\r\nf this, i.e. the original gold used to make the necklace&quot;, he may not be im=\r\npressed.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;In fact, he may even tell you that one can melt the n=\r\necklace and create the &quot;root&quot; gold from it and create other golden objects =\r\n(bangle, arrow etc) from it. So, from his perspective, the golden necklace =\r\nis the best golden object and every golden object can be created from it.&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Of course, one who is equally amazed by the golden arrow may\n s=\r\nay the same thing about the arrow!&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;For Lord Hanuman, Rama was everything. All gods (including Vishnu) were pr=\r\nesent in Rama and Hanuman saw all gods as emanating from Rama. Lord Rama wa=\r\ns the supreme god and source of all, in Hanuman&#39;s eyes.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Annama=\r\nyya had exactly the same attitude regarding Lord Venkateswara (Balaji). He =\r\nwas the source of all in his eyes.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;Many saints and yogis had t=\r\nhe same attitude regarding Lord Krishna.&lt;br&gt;&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;br&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;br&gt;As long as you are talking about the field of duality, every &quot;truth&quot;=\r\n has a reference frame. Though we are used to linear logic, linear hierarch=\r\nies etc, that is because of the reference frame our mind stands on. The fie=\r\nld of duality has scope for really complicated versions of\n reality. As I s=\r\naid, it is a matter of reference frame. Compared to the reference frame exp=\r\nerienced by the minds of normal persons stuck deeply in maayaa, reference f=\r\nrames of great yogis and saints who overcame most layers of maayaa give a b=\r\netter and larger view of the field of duality. But, remember, they too are =\r\nin the grip of maayaa at some level or the other and nothing is absolute.

It is understandable if he says Rama is an i=\r\ndeal man but hard to believe that such a great person claims Rama is not Go=\r\nd. Tempted to ask him what really is the definition of God which differenti=\r\nates Rama from Krishna?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;Some months back I had a =\r\nvery lengthy, verbose and charged/heated debate with him on whether Sri Ram=\r\na is God or not. Mind you, these are all theoritical/ theological debates -=\r\n nothing to do with actual spirituality. Finally he stopped the debate beca=\r\nuse I was getting agitated and it would have affected our friendship. &lt;/div=\r\n&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Whenever his opinion is asked on anything, he wil=\r\nl only mention that what he can support using logic. Therefore he never gen=\r\nerally discusses spirituality with anyone per se. He will discuss and debat=\r\ne scriptures using exact quotations etc, (theology)&nbsp;but not about myst=\r\nicism or sadhana or anything which&nbsp;needs a belief system. That is why =\r\nmost people know him only as a very rational, massively knowledgeable and u=\r\nncorruptable&nbsp; human being.&nbsp;&nbsp;They have no clue about his medi=\r\ntations or anything. He never projects himself as spiritual and generally w=\r\nould not discuss God in public.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Therefore our=\r\n discussion was also on those aspects which can be proved or disproved theo=\r\nlogically&nbsp; - 1) Is Rama a God as per Valmiki Ramayana&nbsp; 2) Is it w=\r\nrong if people consider him as God&nbsp;.. 3) The merits of the Ramcharit M=\r\nanas of Tulasidasji.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;1) To the first question=\r\n, he believes the answer is &quot;no&quot;. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;2) To the s=\r\necond question he says it cannot be debated from a spiritual point if it is=\r\n right or wrong&nbsp;- but his personal opinion is that one should try to f=\r\nollow the way of life shown by Sri Rama rather than worshipping him. He sai=\r\nd, Sri Rama had mastery of all divine weapons. He could have destroyed Rava=\r\nna and his whole army in a blink of an eye, right from the place where he w=\r\nas&nbsp;located when he first heard the news of Sita&#39;s abduction, but Rama =\r\ndid not do so and instead chose the hard way of destroying Ravana - the hum=\r\nan way. So as per my friend, it is more important to emulate Rama&#39;s ideas t=\r\nhan to worship Rama.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;3) He considers the Ramc=\r\nharit Manas, from a literary angle, a hodgepodge of langauges and styles ra=\r\nnging from Awadhi to BrajBhasa. An author&#39;s paradise (since many rules of c=\r\nomposition has been flouted) but a critics nightmare. Also, there is a line=\r\n in there which equates women with animals or something similar. He believe=\r\ns that was introduces in the text because Tulasidas had a problem controlli=\r\nng his own lust. Therefore, he ended up composing a sentence derogatory to =\r\nwomen. Further, he argues that if Sri Rama is worshipped as God, then the p=\r\nurpose of his Avatarhood goes waste. Sri Rama was there to explain idea way=\r\n of life. Krishna was there to be worshipped because Krishna was maximum ab=\r\nility of God on this plane. Nothing can be more God than Krishna was on thi=\r\ns plane, so he thinks.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;The above are merely h=\r\nis opinions, feel free to disagree. &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/d=\r\niv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Dear Utpal,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div class=3D&quot;im&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;One =\r\nrequest, if you can speak to him about his thought on Food habits, it&#39;ll be=\r\n great.&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;i&gt;&lt;/i&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div&gt;I have been out of to=\r\nuch with him since August, been busy myself. But will ask him. However I do=\r\nn&#39;t know whether he will respond. Because as I explained above, he rarely d=\r\niscusses/debates anything from a purely spiritual angle. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;It was only by chance that I found out one day about his medit=\r\nations etc and then he confirmed them when asked.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;I have seen him debating with Vegans - purely from a scientific point o=\r\nf view - about why there is no harm in having regulated amounts of meat (no=\r\nt red meat). &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;But I say, as Narasimha said, th=\r\nis person should not be taken as an ideal regarding food&nbsp; habits.

I met him a=\r\nbout two years back. What first attracted me to&nbsp; towards him was his i=\r\nmpeccable honestly. I mean, he is a maniac&nbsp;when it comes to&nbsp;hones=\r\ntly.&nbsp;If someone were to put a gun to his head and ask him to just say =\r\na simple, harmless&nbsp;lie, like sun rises in the west, he would not say i=\r\nt. Therefore he never jokes with anyone too! He has actually never ever&nbs=\r\np;spoken even a single lie in his whole life, big or small. When he was in =\r\nhis school, once his teacher told him that Indian languages are richer than=\r\n English, he believed his teacher. Later someone else told him English is m=\r\nore comprehensive language and the world cannot do with it. He got confused=\r\n. Since that day, he bought himself two thick fat dictionaries, one English=\r\n, one Hindi and for ten years every day he spend one\n hour reading the Engl=\r\nish dictionary and one hour reading the Hindi dictionary apart from reading=\r\n&nbsp;up volumes of Hindi and English literature.&nbsp;When I asked him why=\r\n, he just said it is because he wanted to be&nbsp;equally adept at both the=\r\n languages so that one day he can take a really detached view to judge the =\r\ntruth about&nbsp;which is more comprehensive language! As I said, he has an=\r\n uncompromising attitude when it comes to finding out the truth about anyth=\r\ning. By education, he is a Phd is mathematics. He has worked in different f=\r\nields, from banking to education to journalism. He did not last for long in=\r\n most places. He speaks and writes fluently, English, Bengali, Hindi, Urdu,=\r\n Sanskrit, Arabic, Persian, French. Now he is learning Tamil. He composes p=\r\noetry in all the above languages. When he was in college, he considered him=\r\nself an atheist. While applying for a job he had kept the place makered for=\r\n religion as blank. When the clerk who was\n supposed to take the forms saw =\r\nthat blank space, he asked my friend&#39;s name. Hearing a Hindu name, the cler=\r\nk wrote &quot;Hindu&quot;. Seeing this, my friend snatched the form from the clerk an=\r\nd tore it up right there. Because, he considered himself an atheist and wri=\r\nting Hindu in the form would have been a lie. &lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;di=\r\nv&gt;So this gives a basic idea of the man I am speaking of. All his friends, =\r\nwhoever knows him, calls him Rama of Kaliyuga.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div=\r\n&gt;One day, long back, he was going to office for some urgent meeting. His wa=\r\ny to office passed by a Krishna temple. As he was passing by in&nbsp;his sc=\r\nooter, suddenly he felt a strange urge to go into the temple. He says he st=\r\nill does not know why he went inside the temple, but he did. That was at 9 =\r\no clock in the morning. Next when he sees his watch it is 4:30 in the eveni=\r\nng! And he has no knowledge of how the time went. When he asked the priest,=\r\n the priest said that he went into the temple sat down and just stayed as h=\r\ne was for the whole time without any movement. The priest somehow felt scar=\r\ned to disturb him. But my friend had no idea why this happened. He remember=\r\ned nothing, as if he was in deep sleep.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Then =\r\nhe started meditating at home, and it was there&nbsp;that he got visions et=\r\nc of Krishna. He does not say much about these, infact most people who know=\r\n him also do not know these things. But once he was in samadhi for 72 hours=\r\n, not moving from his meditation seat, in the exact same place and same pos=\r\nition for 3 days continuously.&nbsp; Only his wife and close relatives know=\r\n about this incident. I believe nowadays when ever he sits for meditation h=\r\ne often enters the state of Samadhi. When someone asked him how he felt dur=\r\ning samadhi, he just said it feels as if the whole universe orginates from =\r\nme. I am the sun, the moon, the stars, the planets, the animals, men, women=\r\n, children, the wind, the water, the space, smaller than the atom and bigge=\r\nr than everything. It cannot be accurately desribed.&nbsp;He considers Sri =\r\nKrishna to be God and&nbsp;Lord Rama to be the ideal man.That is why he doe=\r\ns not like the Ramacharit Manas because he thinks it\n elevated Sri&nbsp;Ram=\r\na to the level of a God whereas the aim of the orginal Valmiki Ramayana was=\r\n to show Sri Rama as an ideal &lt;i&gt;man,&nbsp;&lt;/i&gt;not a God.The difference he =\r\nsays is that, an ideal man is someone who can be emulated, an ordinary man =\r\ncan and should aim to become like the ideal. But a God cannot be emulated b=\r\ny ordinary men. One cannot become Krishna, but one&nbsp;can try to lead his=\r\n life like Rama. I have argued with him over this, but I am merely stating =\r\nhis idea. Also he does not have a Guru - a human guru at least, and advises=\r\n people to not trust most Gurus these days. Needless to say, he is not an a=\r\ntheist any more.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Later he had once&nbsp;menti=\r\noned he knew the relation he had with all the people around him in his past=\r\n lives. His mother he says, was his daughter in his past life etc. Nowadays=\r\n he spends a lot of time on different internet forums interacting with peop=\r\nle, specially&nbsp;with those in&nbsp;the age group of 18 to 30, discussing=\r\n anything and everything with them, from Indian politics to Indian history,=\r\n religion, etc etc. His idea is to impart right knowledge to young people w=\r\nho will be the future of this country.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;He is =\r\nam omnivorous person. Like any other Bengali, eats fish, meat etc.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I shall refrain from mentioning his name because I had=\r\n not asked his permission before mentioning him.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;-Regards&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;PS: I woul=\r\nd not like this mail to be considered as a part of the debate.

Do you know him as a=\r\n friend and is he a Indian? What sort of path/sadhana is he following?? Is =\r\nhe a sannyasin or a householder ?Did specific changes happened in his life =\r\nafter&nbsp; he had these samadhi and visions.Any other special things about=\r\n him.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;In the Gita Lord is saying whatever you do/eat offer it to me=\r\n first. So he is offering all these non-veg to Lord with devotion, Right?? =\r\nThen prasdam all around??&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;My curious questions are not against your =\r\nacceptance of his exexperienceut to learn more.After all he is\n part of hid=\r\nden violence. Somebody is inflicting gruesome&nbsp; pain and misery on anim=\r\nals and birds on his behalf and he is consuming them and yet he is experien=\r\ncing all these exotic&nbsp; visions, But no feeling of kindness towards bir=\r\nds and animals.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Where did I go wrong? Simple dal/roti and do not ev=\r\nen touch onion/garlic/ pepper but no such samadhi? &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;When we get burn=\r\nt, we need to be careful.Many years ago I saw in a book/article&nbsp; about=\r\n Dayamata who succeded&nbsp; Paramhansa Yoganand. Once she went to India an=\r\nd told a Spiritual Master that her progress has stopped. Master said, you a=\r\nre eating eggs which she admitted that she was doing&nbsp; secretly.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;This is very complex world. No outright solutions for so many difficult q=\r\nuestions. Followers of 3 faiths which all originated in middle east are fig=\r\nhting each other all the time. Sometimes I think, from which part of Spirit=\r\nual Sky these energies are coming,Are they also enemies\n there?? Their Gods=\r\n said in their holy books that animals are their food. So they cannot even =\r\nthink about souls in animals or their pain and emotions.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Then I have=\r\n read stories about several people, who follow these faiths and are non-veg=\r\n and how they exexperience&nbsp; spiritual highs and other such phenomena. =\r\nIt is so difficult to comprehend.&nbsp; Would they remain in the cycle of b=\r\n/d&nbsp; till they learn about kindness???&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Kind Regards&lt;br&gt;LaxmiNar=\r\nayan&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- On Sat, 12/12/09, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14=\r\n@yahoo. &lt;a rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot; href=3D&quot;http://co.in/&quot;&gt;co.in&lt;=\r\n/a&gt;&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbo=\r\ndy&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table&gt;&lt;br=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;hr size=3D&quot;1&quot;&gt;\nThe INTERNET now has a personality.
