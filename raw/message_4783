Have you made a list of other powerful Vedic mantra?\n \nEvery hymn of Veda is powerful. However, the ability to harness that power has been nearly taken away from humanity. As I said earlier, people use Veda mantras like any other mantras today. This is just like one using a gun as a stick to beat up an enemy.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; My sincere heartfelt thanks, a thousand times, to those who\n&gt; put their efforts in compiling this &quot;Modern Kathaamruta&quot;.\n \nUtpal, flamboyance can often make one lose one&#39;s balance.\n \n*        *        *\n \n&gt; &gt; A great work. Our expectation are growing day by day to get\n&gt; &gt; such great things.\n \nI want to remind people of one basic fact. Books, lectures and writeups are nice to read or listen to. But, at the end, what saves one is one&#39;s own sadhana. The goal of lectures and books is to inspire and prepare one to do sadhana. Nothing substitutes that. Let us remember that.\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \n---- Jacques Le Vangie &lt;mojavecowboy@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Narasimha:\n&gt; \n&gt; In this book, you mention Vedic mantra, with an example as the Gayatri.
