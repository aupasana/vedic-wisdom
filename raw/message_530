Devadatta Kali has been cl=\r\nosely \nassociated with the Vedanta Society since 1966. A regular \ncontribut=\r\nor to Vedanta journals throughout the world, the author&#39;s \nbook Chandi, In =\r\nPraise of the Goddess: The Devimahatmya and Its \nMeaning, is due to be publ=\r\nished by Nicholas-Hays in December, 2003.\n\n\n\nIn The Gospel of Sri Ramakrish=\r\nna, M[ahendranath Gupta] records a \nSunday afternoon with some visitors to =\r\nDakshineswar in the winter of \n1883. One of the visitors was well versed in=\r\n the shastras [the \nsacred Hindu scriptures], and the conversation caused M=\r\n. to fall \ninto a pensive mood. Having some knowledge of Vedanta, he later =\r\n\nasked Sri Ramakrishna, &quot;Is the world unreal?&quot;\n\n&quot;Why should it be unreal?&quot; =\r\nSri Ramakrishna responded. &quot;What you are \nasking is a matter for philosophi=\r\ncal discussion.&quot; Later that evening \nRamakrishna returned to M.&#39;s question =\r\nand asked him again, &quot;Why \nshould the universe be unreal?&quot; He continued, &quot;T=\r\nhe Divine Mother \nrevealed to me in the Kali temple that it was She who had=\r\n become \neverything. She showed me that everything was full of Consciousnes=\r\ns. \nThe image =85, the altar =85, the water-vessels =85, the door-sill =85,=\r\n the \nmarble floor =85=97all was Consciousness.\n\n&quot;I found everything inside=\r\n the room soaked, as it were, in Bliss=97the \nBliss of Satchidananda. I saw=\r\n a wicked man in front of the Kali \ntemple, but in him I also saw the Power=\r\n of the Divine Mother \nvibrating. &quot;That is why I fed a cat with the food th=\r\nat was to be \noffered to the Divine Mother. I clearly perceived that the Di=\r\nvine \nMother Herself had become everything (M., 345-346).&quot;\n\nOn many other o=\r\nccasions, M. recorded similar teachings, and on one \npoint Sri Ramakrishna =\r\nwas particularly emphatic. &quot;=85 Brahman and \nShakti are identical. If you a=\r\nccept one, you must accept the other. \n=85 You cannot conceive of the sun&#39;s=\r\n rays without the sun, nor can you \nconceive of the sun without its rays. =\r\n=85 One cannot think of the \nAbsolute without the Relative, or of the Relat=\r\nive without the \nAbsolute (M., 134).&quot;\n\nAnother time Sri Ramakrishna said: &quot;=\r\nThat which is Brahman is also \nKali, the Mother, the Primal Energy. When in=\r\nactive It is called \nBrahman. Again, when creating, preserving and destroyi=\r\nng, It is \ncalled Shakti. Still water is an illustration of Brahman. The sa=\r\nme \nwater, moving in waves, may be compared to Shakti, Kali (M., 634-\n635).=\r\n&quot; &quot;Water is water, whether it moves or is still (M., 835).&quot; \n\nThese are con=\r\nsistent teachings of Sri Ramakrishna, spoken from his \nown experience, but =\r\nthey are not the teachings of Sankara&#39;s Vedanta. \nWithout question, Ramakri=\r\nshna was well versed in Vedantic teaching. \nWe know that toward the end of =\r\n1865, he took initiation from an \naustere monk named Tota Puri, practiced t=\r\nhe disciplines of Sankara&#39;s \nAdvaita Vedanta and in a short while attained =\r\nnirvikalpa samadhi, \nthe realization of nondual consciousness. But four yea=\r\nrs earlier \nRamakrishna had undergone an intensive course of Tantric sadhan=\r\na, \ntaught to him by an itinerant holy woman known as the Bhairavi. She \nwa=\r\ns a Shakta, a worshiper of the Divine Mother. \n\nNor was this Sri Ramakrishn=\r\na&#39;s first exposure to Shakta teachings. \nEarlier still, at the age of 19, w=\r\nhen the young Ramakrishna agreed \nto be employed as a priest at the Dakshin=\r\neswar Kali temple, he was \ntrained by his older brother Ramkumar in the Mot=\r\nher&#39;s worship and in \nthe recitation of the Chandi, the great scripture on =\r\nthe Divine \nMother (Saradananda, 133-134). \n\nThe Chandi declares that the M=\r\nother is the supreme reality and that \nshe herself has become this universe=\r\n. We do not know who composed \nthe Chandi, only that its author or authors =\r\ncreated the most widely \nknown and most sacred of all Shakta texts about si=\r\nxteen hundred \nyears ago. Some of the traditions preserved in the Chandi ar=\r\ne \ninconceivably older. We know from the evidence of archeology that \nsome =\r\nof the Chandi&#39;s ideas on the Motherhood of God go back six \nthousand years =\r\nor more. Votive statues that survive from neolithic \nIndia and Pakistan por=\r\ntray a goddess in two different aspects: \neither as a nurturing mother with=\r\n hand held to breast, or as a \nhooded, deathlike figure. \n\nThis dual distin=\r\nction of the Divine Mother in auspicious and \nterrible forms is an enduring=\r\n feature throughout the history of \nIndian religion and survives to this ve=\r\nry day. Throughout the ages \nthe tribal cultures and high civilizations tha=\r\nt rose and fell on \nIndian soil left their mark on the 13 chapters of the C=\r\nhandi. \nProminent among the many and diverse influences is the Devisukta, a=\r\n \nhymn of eight verses found in the most ancient Hindu sacred text, \nthe Ri=\r\ng Veda. \n\nThe Devisukta (RV 10.125) declares that the Goddess is the power =\r\n\nexpressed through all the gods, that they are united in her who \nshines wi=\r\nth consciousness, that her presence is all-pervading, that \nshe supports al=\r\nl of creation, that she is the source of \nrighteousness and the revealer of=\r\n truth, that she is the source of \nall worlds, yet that she shines transcen=\r\ndent beyond them. Among \nShaktas this Vedic hymn is held in high esteem and=\r\n is considered to \nbe the source from which the entire Chandi sprang. Later=\r\n, the Chandi \nitself was elaborated upon in the Puranas and Tantras. Still =\r\nlater \nits imagery inspired the Bengali mystics, Ramprasad and Kamalakanta,=\r\n \nwhose devotional songs so often evoked ecstatic moods in Sri \nRamakrishna=\r\n. \n\nThe Chandi goes by two other names. The most common and widely \nrecogni=\r\nzed is Devimahatmya [The Glory of the Goddess]. The other is \nSri Durga Sap=\r\ntashati [Seven Hundred Verses to Sri Durga]. In reality \nthe Chandi contain=\r\ns fewer than 700 verses, and the number 700 is \narrived at only through cre=\r\native means, such as counting a half \nverse as full or a full verse as thre=\r\ne. There must be a good reason \nfor this, and indeed there is. \n\nThe author=\r\n or authors of the Chandi were Shaktas, devotees of the \nMother, and they w=\r\nanted their work to be recognized as comparable to \nthe Vaishnavas&#39; great s=\r\ncripture, the Bhagavad Gita, which consists \nof 700 verses. They wanted to =\r\nshow that their view of God as Mother \nwas as valid as the Vaishnava view o=\r\nf Krishna as the supreme God. Of \ncourse, both texts represent ancient trad=\r\nitions, and even the oldest \nHindu scripture, the Rig Veda, proclaims: ekam=\r\n sat vipra bahuda \nvadanti=97&quot;Truth is One, the wise call it by various nam=\r\nes.&quot; Many \ncenturies later, Sri Ramakrishna taught the same when he \nsaid: =\r\n&quot;Krishna is none other than Satchidananda, the Indivisible \nBrahman. =85 Th=\r\nat which is Brahman is also Kali. =85 He who is Krishna \nis the same as Kal=\r\ni (M., 1012).&quot; \n\nIn drawing comparison to the Bhagavad Gita, the authors of=\r\n the \nChandi wanted specifically to emphasize the Divine Mother&#39;s role, \nli=\r\nke Krishna&#39;s, in upholding the moral order of the universe and in \nleading =\r\nhumankind to liberation through the highest knowledge of the \nSelf. The Cha=\r\nndi and the Gita have much else in common. Each is an \nindependent text emb=\r\nedded in a larger work. The Gita belongs to the \nMahabharata; the Chandi is=\r\n an interpolation in the Markandeya \nPurana. Each is a synthesis of spiritu=\r\nal and philosophical knowledge \ndrawn from diverse sources. Each begins wit=\r\nh the story of one or \nmore human beings in crisis, who will learn from a t=\r\neacher in human \nform the way beyond all suffering. And each involves the b=\r\nattlefield \nas a metaphor for the field of human consciousness. \n\nThe Bhaga=\r\nvad Gita begins on the battlefield, with Arjuna surveying \nthe armies of hi=\r\ns kinsmen on both sides, arrayed for battle. Plunged \ninto despair at the t=\r\nhought of killing his friends and relatives, he \nturns to his charioteer, K=\r\nrishna, who is none other than God in \nhuman form. Krishna then delivers on=\r\ne of the world&#39;s great spiritual \nmessages. The Chandi begins with King Sur=\r\natha, likewise plunged into \nan existential crisis after losing his kingdom=\r\n in battle. \n\nA wise and just ruler, Suratha discovers that even his truste=\r\nd \nministers have turned against him, and on the pretext of going \nhunting,=\r\n he mounts his horse and flees for his life. After riding \nfor some time in=\r\nto a dense forest, he comes to the ashram of a holy \nman named Medhas. This=\r\n forest retreat is a place of great calm and \nnatural beauty, where even th=\r\ne ordinarily ferocious tiger abides \npeacefully with the gentle deer. Yet S=\r\nuratha knows no peace. His \nmind churns in agony at the thought of everythi=\r\nng he has lost: his \nkingdom with its riches and privilege, the loyalty of =\r\nhis subjects, \nthe glory of power. These thoughts torment him ceaselessly. =\r\n\n\nOne day another visitor arrives. His name is Samadhi, and he is \nevery bi=\r\nt as despondent as the king. Once a prosperous merchant, he \nhas been cast =\r\nout by his wife and sons, who seized his wealth out of \ngreed. He is deeply=\r\n hurt by their betrayal and cannot understand it, \nbeing himself a man of g=\r\nood character. Most of all, he cannot \nunderstand why he still feels love f=\r\nor those who caused his deep \nhumiliation and pain. And so, the king and th=\r\ne merchant approach \nMedhas the seer and ask why they are so miserable. Sur=\r\nely, as men of \nknowledge they ought to know better, but they are deeply pe=\r\nrplexed. \n\n&quot;You say you are men of knowledge,&quot; Medhas remarks. &quot;Do you know=\r\n \nwhat knowledge is?&quot; He explains that what the king means by \nknowledge is=\r\n only the experience of the objective world. Through the \nsenses, men, bird=\r\ns and beasts alike share such a knowledge, each \nspecies according to its o=\r\nwn capacity. Such knowledge is relative. \nIn every way, the knowledge gaine=\r\nd through the senses is conditioned \nby time and space, and we are constant=\r\nly deceived. Medhas explains \nfurther that animals act out of instinct; but=\r\n humans have the added \ncapacity to reason and make choices, although such =\r\nchoices are most \noften driven by self-interest and the expectation of resu=\r\nlts. \n\nIf even our simple sense perceptions are so misleading, how much \nmo=\r\nre confounded are we by the added factors of reason, will, memory, \nemotion=\r\n and expectation? The operative principle here is that \nnothing in this wor=\r\nld is as it seems to be. Not only are the king \nand the merchant perplexed,=\r\n Medhas explains, everyone is, because \neven the wise are thrown into the w=\r\nhirlpool of delusion by the \nblessed goddess Mahamaya. &quot;Who is this Mahamay=\r\na?&quot; the king \nasks. &quot;Whatever there is to know about her, all that I wish t=\r\no \nlearn.&quot; \n\nAnd so we arrive at the heart of the Chandi. The story of the =\r\nking, \nthe merchant and the seer acts as a frame that encloses three \naddit=\r\nional stories which Medhas relates to instruct his two \ndisciples. Each sto=\r\nry is a mythical account of the Divine Mother&#39;s \nfierce, bloody battles wit=\r\nh demons. Now, we must not dismiss a myth \nas a piece of fiction merely bec=\r\nause it does not describe a \nhistorical event or the world as we know it. I=\r\nnstead, a myth takes \nus beyond the realm of fact and into the realm of mea=\r\nning. Through \nsymbols, it plumbs our deeper levels of understanding and br=\r\nings to \nlight elusive truths that are difficult to convey by ordinary mean=\r\ns. \n\nThe Platonic philosopher Synesius of Cyrene summed it up in a single \n=\r\nsentence: &quot;Myths are things that never happened, but always are \n(Greer, 45=\r\n).&quot; The Chandi is an allegory. Its battlegrounds represent \nour own human c=\r\nonsciousness, and its events symbolize our own \nexperiences. The demons rep=\r\nresent all the evils in the world and all \nthat is wrong within our minds a=\r\nnd hearts. The Divine Mother is our \nown true being, and her clashes with t=\r\nhe demons symbolize the \noutward and inward struggles we face daily. \n\nBeca=\r\nuse there are three myths, the Chandi naturally falls into three \nparts, an=\r\nd they can be related to the three gunas, the basic \nuniversal energies or =\r\nqualities of sattva, rajas and tamas. The \nfirst part tells about the Divin=\r\ne Mother in her dark, deluding \naspect that ensnares humankind in the bonds=\r\n of ignorance and \nattachment. It teaches us about the nature of reality an=\r\nd asks us to \nquestion: what are divinity, the universe and humankind? \n\nTh=\r\ne second part presents the Mother as the fiery and active power \nthat vanqu=\r\nishes evil and upholds the moral order of the universe. It \nteaches us how =\r\nto live in this world, where we are torn between good \nand evil, right and =\r\nwrong, enjoyment and suffering. \n\nThe third part reveals the luminous, bene=\r\nvolent form through which \nthe Mother grants enlightenment and liberation. =\r\nIt shows us how to \ntranscend the world through the higher knowledge of the=\r\n spirit. Side \nby side with grisly narratives of bloodshed and slaughter, t=\r\nhe \nChandi integrates four hymns that are rich in philosophical and \ntheolo=\r\ngical content. Of surpassing beauty, these hymns are sublime \noutpourings o=\r\nf devotion. The variety of material in the Chandi is a \nconvenient reminder=\r\n that overall this text can be approached in more \nthan one way. Its storie=\r\ns can be taken as allegories relating to our \nown behavior and circumstance=\r\ns. Its hymns inspire us to devotion for \nthe personal forms of God as Mothe=\r\nr; and its deeper, philosophical \nand esoteric interpretation leads us to t=\r\nhe realization of God as \nthe impersonal supreme reality. \n\nMedhas&#39;s first =\r\nmyth is short and to the point. During a period of \ncosmic dissolution, Vis=\r\nhnu lies sleeping on the thousand-headed \nserpent Shesha, who drifts on the=\r\n waters of the undifferentiated \nocean. Sitting on a lotus that grows from =\r\nVishnu&#39;s navel, Brahma, \nthe Lord of Creation, surveys the four directions.=\r\n Suddenly two \ndemons, named Madhu and Kaitabha, spring forth from the wax =\r\nin \nVishnu&#39;s ears and attempt to kill Brahma. Frantically he tries to \nawak=\r\nen Vishnu, but the god is held in the power of Mahamaya, who is \nsettled ov=\r\ner his eyes as his blessed sleep. \n\nAnd so Brahma praises Mahamaya with a h=\r\nymn. She allows Vishnu to \nawaken, and he battles with the demons for 5000 =\r\nyears, but without \nvictory. At this point Mahamaya intervenes again. She c=\r\nonfounds \nMadhu and Kaitabha with delusions of their own might and grandeur=\r\n. \nLook at us, the demons think. Not even Vishnu, the Supreme Lord, can \nco=\r\nnquer us. Because he has fought so well, let us offer him a boon. \nThese bi=\r\ng, lumbering demons are comical in their stupidity, and at \nthis point we c=\r\nan almost hear them gasp, &quot;Oops! Did we make a \nmistake?&quot; \n\nOf course they =\r\ndid, because Vishnu replies, &quot;There is only one boon \nto ask: that I destro=\r\ny the two of you here and now.&quot; In a last-ditch \neffort to save themselves,=\r\n Madhu and Kaitabha look around and see \nonly the endless cosmic ocean. &quot;Ve=\r\nry well,&quot; they say, &quot;but on one \ncondition: slay us where water does not co=\r\nver the earth.&quot; The \noutcome of this story hinges on a pun, because the San=\r\nskrit words \nfor &quot;earth&quot; and &quot;thigh&quot; are almost the same. And so, Vishnu li=\r\nfts \nthe two demons to his thighs and cuts off their heads. It is said \ntha=\r\nt a pun is the lowest form of humor, and this is fitting, because \nMadhu an=\r\nd Kaitabha represent the lowest form of human awareness, \ndensely shrouded =\r\nin ignorance. Their unprovoked attack on Brahma \nreminds us of the senseles=\r\ns violence in our own world, where members \nof one religious or political o=\r\nr ethnic group attack people of other \ngroups only because they are differe=\r\nnt. \n\nMadhu and Kaitabha, in their near-bestial state, recognize no higher =\r\n\nreality; they are violent, ugly creatures intent on gratifying their \nbase=\r\n instincts, often expressed through the thrill of intimidation \nor brute fo=\r\nrce. In their physical strength they grow exceedingly \nvainglorious. But of=\r\n course pride goes before a fall, and their own \narrogance becomes their un=\r\ndoing. Through the hymn that Brahma \naddresses to Mahamaya, the universal d=\r\neluder, we learn much about \nthe universe we inhabit. This hymn, the Brahma=\r\nstuti, is composed in \nhighly symbolic language that is often difficult to =\r\ninterpret, but \nit reveals profound insight into the nature of the cosmos. =\r\nAlthough \nthe ideas are expressed in devotional terms, the concepts are \nsc=\r\nientific even by today&#39;s standards. \n\nThe Brahmastuti tells us that creatio=\r\nn is a process of manifestation \nthat flows from the One to the many. The D=\r\nivine Mother is the \ninfinite, nondual consciousness as well as its dynamic=\r\n creative \npower; and she is ever present throughout all of creation. Befor=\r\ne \nmanifestation, she is the bindu, the dimensionless, nonlocalized \npoint =\r\nof concentrated shakti that contains within itself all \npossibilities. This=\r\n sounds very much like the Big Bang theory and \nespecially like a recent re=\r\nfinement of it, known as the Cosmic \nInflation theory. This proposes that t=\r\nhe entire universe popped out \nof a dimensionless, contentless point and im=\r\nmediately expanded to \ncosmic size in a miraculous way, suggesting the agen=\r\ncy of a higher \npower. \n\nLet us not forget that the Sanskrit word for &quot;powe=\r\nr&quot; is shakti. \nAccording to Brahma&#39;s hymn, the Divine Mother gives birth to=\r\n the \nuniverse, supports it and draws it back into herself in an ever-\nrepe=\r\nating cycle, because creation is without an absolute beginning \nor an absol=\r\nute end. In this process, she who is nondual \nconsciousness veils her radia=\r\nnt boundlessness with the limitations \nof time and space, name and form, ca=\r\nuse and effect. Through these \nlimitations she projects the finite world of=\r\n our experience=97a world \nthat is both dark and dazzling, terrifying and e=\r\nnchanting. \n\nThe Divine Mother is the all-encompassing source of good and e=\r\nvil \nalike, who expresses herself in every form. Yet beyond this apparent \n=\r\nmultiplicity, everything=97be it spirit, mind or matter=97is ultimately \non=\r\ne. Philosophically, the Chandi agrees with Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s \nanswer to M.&#39;=\r\ns question, &quot;Is the world unreal?&quot; But when Ramakrishna \nfirst replied that=\r\n it was a matter for philosophical discussion, he \nrecognized that among th=\r\nemselves Hindus hold more than a single \nopinion. A follower of Sankara&#39;s A=\r\ndvaita Vedanta would answer, &quot;The \nworld seems real as long as we experienc=\r\ne it, but once we attain \nknowledge of Brahman, the phenomenal world vanish=\r\nes. We think we see \na snake in the semi-darkness, but when the light revea=\r\nls it to be a \nrope, the perception of the snake vanishes.&quot; \n\nAccording to =\r\nthe Vedantin, the world is no more real than the \nmisperceived snake. This =\r\nposition is called vivartavada, the \ndoctrine of appearance, because the ph=\r\nenomenal world is thought to \nbe a mere appearance superimposed upon the tr=\r\nanscendental unity of \nBrahman. The Shakta philosophy takes a different pos=\r\nition. When \nthread is woven into cloth, it undergoes a change of form but =\r\nnot of \nsubstance. In becoming cloth, thread takes on the additional \nquali=\r\nties of cloth, but in substance it is still thread. In the same \nway, the D=\r\nivine Mother, who is pure energy and consciousness, \nassumes all the names =\r\nand forms and characteristics of the creation, \neven while remaining the pu=\r\nre energy and consciousness that is her \ntrue nature. This view is called p=\r\narinamavada, the doctrine of \ntransformation. \n\nWe find it in the Chandi, w=\r\nhere Medhas says of the Divine \nMother: &quot;She is eternal, having the world a=\r\ns her form (DM 1.64).&quot; \nAnd also in Sri Ramakrishna&#39;s reply to M.: &quot;The Div=\r\nine Mother \nrevealed to me in the Kali temple that it was She who had becom=\r\ne \neverything (M., 345).&quot; There is one more point: whichever way we \nchoose=\r\n to view the world, we still have to live in it. And that is \nwhat the seco=\r\nnd part of the Chandi is all about. \n\nMedhas&#39;s second story is intended esp=\r\necially for the king. Suratha, \nlike Arjuna in the Gita, belongs to the rul=\r\ning and warrior caste, \nwhose duty is to uphold the moral order of the worl=\r\nd. In the story \nthat Medhas relates, an ill-tempered buffalo demon, named =\r\n\nMahishasura, wages war against heaven, casts out the gods, and \nusurps Ind=\r\nra&#39;s throne. When the dispossessed gods seek Vishnu&#39;s and \nShiva&#39;s help, th=\r\ne Divine Mother herself comes to the rescue. \n\nFirst from Vishnu&#39;s brow, th=\r\nen from the bodies of all the other \ngods, a great radiance shines forth an=\r\nd coalesces into the beautiful \nform of Durga. The gods bow to her, recogni=\r\nzing that their own \nindividual powers are only aspects of her supreme powe=\r\nr. After Durga \nhas slain Mahishasura&#39;s forces, she stands on the blood-soa=\r\nked \nbattleground facing the buffalo demon himself. Mahishasura, \nbellowing=\r\n in confrontation, represents willfulness and monumental \nrage. Under his f=\r\nrenzied wheeling, the trampled earth breaks apart, \nhis blasting breath tos=\r\nses mountains into the air, his lashing tail \ncauses the oceans to overflow=\r\n, and overhead his mighty horns tear \nthe gently floating clouds to shreds.=\r\n \n\nConsider the symbolism: the power of human anger and greed threatens \nto=\r\n destroy everything it touches: the goodness of the nurturing \nearth, the s=\r\ntability of the mountains, the expansive beauty of the \noceans, the innocen=\r\nce of the gentle clouds. Under Durga&#39;s attacks \nMahisha changes form=97from=\r\n buffalo to lion to man to elephant, every \ntime eluding her deathblows. Bu=\r\nt she resolves to slay him, and when \nMahisha returns to his mighty buffalo=\r\n form, she pins him beneath her \nfoot and thrusts her spear into his side. =\r\nInstantly Mahisha reveals \nhis true demon form, and Durga beheads him with =\r\nher great sword. \n\nLike Mahisha, we go through life dissatisfied, often agi=\r\ntated, \nsometimes full of rage; and the causes of our misery change over \nt=\r\nime. One day it&#39;s this, the next day it&#39;s something else, and so it \ngoes. =\r\nUntil we can pin down the root cause, our discontent cannot be \novercome, a=\r\nnd like Mahishasura that cause is loath to reveal itself. \nMahisha represen=\r\nts more than monumental rage. His anger is one of \nsix passions that afflic=\r\nt our human awareness. The others are lust, \ngreed, pride, jealousy and del=\r\nusion. Let&#39;s analyze them. Lust, or \ndesire in general, is a longing for gr=\r\natification. We want \nsomething. Why? Because we feel something is lacking.=\r\n We feel \ndeficient, limited or separated in some way. When we fail to sati=\r\nsfy \na desire, a common response is anger. Or when a desire is satisfied, \n=\r\na common response is greed: we want more. And so we&#39;re caught in an \nongoin=\r\ng cycle. To make matters worse, we can add pride and jealousy \nto the mix. =\r\n\n\nLet&#39;s define pride as a false sense of superiority designed to \nconvince =\r\nus we&#39;re not deficient after all, but in fact better than \nanyone else. And=\r\n so we think=97until someone else comes along whom we \nsee as richer, more =\r\npowerful, more attractive or happier than we \nare. Then we fall prey to jea=\r\nlousy=97an apprehensive resentment of \nsomeone else&#39;s better condition in l=\r\nife. All this adds up to \ndelusion: we are caught up in a misreading of who=\r\n and what we really \nare. The Sanskrit word for delusion, moha, comes from =\r\na root \nmeaning &quot;to lose consciousness,&quot; and herein lies the key to \nunders=\r\ntanding. \n\nThe Divine Mother is infinite consciousness. When she projects \n=\r\nherself as the universe of name and form, that consciousness appears \ndivid=\r\ned among all beings. This apparent fragmentation creates the \nsense of indi=\r\nviduality. Each individual self experiences its \nexistence in terms of &quot;I, =\r\nme and mine,&quot; as well as &quot;not-I, not-me \nand not-mine.&quot; And so the trouble =\r\nbegins. The root cause of our \ninner existential discontent and our outward=\r\n conflicts is the \nfeeling deep down inside that we are limited, separated =\r\nand \nincomplete. We mistakenly identify with the limited ego, when in \nfact=\r\n we are the limitless atman. That atman, abiding in every \nperson, is the t=\r\nrue Self=97the one, undivided reality whose essence is \npure being-consciou=\r\nsness-bliss. \n\nJust as Mahishasura is about to be beheaded by Durga&#39;s sword=\r\n of \nknowledge, his glance meets hers, and he gets a fleeting glimpse of \nt=\r\nhat truth=97that his true identity lies dispassionate and blissful \nbeyond =\r\nthe raging whirlpool of his passions. After he is slain, the \ngods celebrat=\r\ne Durga&#39;s triumph over Mahishasura in the longest and \nmost eloquent of the=\r\n Chandi&#39;s four hymns. Known as the Shakradistuti \n[Praise by Indra and the =\r\nhost of gods], it invites us to reflect on \nthe themes of good and evil, fa=\r\nte and free will, karma and divine \ngrace. \n\nThe hymn praises Durga as &quot;goo=\r\nd fortune in the dwellings of the \nvirtuous and misfortune in the abodes of=\r\n the wicked (DM 4.5).&quot; On \nthe surface, this verse implies reward and punis=\r\nhment by a personal \ndeity. The deeper, philosophical meaning points to an =\r\nimpersonal \nbalancing principle at work in the universe, the law of karma. =\r\n\nEither way the message is the same: our deeds have consequences. A \ncentra=\r\nl theme of the hymn is the question of good and evil. A \nworking definition=\r\n might go like this: good is that which takes us \ntoward the Divine=97towar=\r\nd harmony, love and unity; evil is that which \ndistances us from the Divine=\r\n and creates hatred, injury and disunity \nin our lives. \n\nAdditionally, ref=\r\nerring to the fierce battle that has just taken \nplace, the hymn asks how M=\r\nahisha, even though enraged, could be \nmoved to strike the Mother&#39;s gently =\r\nsmiling face. From this we can \nadd another dimension to our definition of =\r\nevil: that it is \nintentionally profaning. In the world around us we witnes=\r\ns continual \nassaults on all we hold sacred. War, terrorism, genocide, the =\r\n\ncorruption of the innocent, the logging of irreplaceable forests, \nand the=\r\n remorseless pollution of the air, water and earth that \nsupport our very e=\r\nxistence=97what evil moves humans to commit such \nterrible acts? \n\nWhether =\r\nwe are talking about destructive actions, hate-filled \nspeech, malevolent t=\r\nhoughts or even uncaring passivity, let these be \na sobering reminder that =\r\nour collective and individual evil is the \nhuman face of Mahishasura&#39;s rage=\r\n. Yet the hymn proclaims that even \ntoward evildoers the Mother&#39;s intention=\r\ns are most gracious. Her \nnature is to subdue the misconduct of the wicked.=\r\n Through her \ninconceivable grace, even wrongdoers who have committed enoug=\r\nh evil \nto keep them long in torment are purified in battle by the touch of=\r\n \nher weapons and are brought to beatitude. \n\nWe are reminded once again of=\r\n the Bhagavadgita. Sri Krishna declares \nthat whenever righteousness declin=\r\nes and evil spreads, he is born \ninto the world to protect the good, to des=\r\ntroy wickedness, and to re-\nestablish virtue (BG 4.6-8). On the theme of un=\r\nconditional grace, he \nsays: &quot;I am alike to all beings; to me none are hate=\r\nful or dear. =85 \nIf even an evil-doer worships me with utter devotion, he =\r\nshould be \nregarded as good, for he is rightly resolved. Quickly he becomes=\r\n \nrighteous and attains eternal peace (BG 9.29-31).&quot; \n\nThe story of Madhu a=\r\nnd Kaitabha was concerned with the power of \ntamas: how in our ordinary sta=\r\nte of being, we all walk around dazed \nand confused. In the story of Durga =\r\nand Mahishasura, the power of \nrajas predominates. Mahishasura&#39;s rajasic en=\r\nergy controls him and \nimpels him to destructive acts, but Durga controls h=\r\ner own fiery \nsplendor. Her rajas is protective of her devotees and intent =\r\non \ndestroying evil. Through this story Medhas teaches that through \nactive=\r\n struggle, we can overcome enslavement to our passions and \nlive virtuously=\r\n, in harmony with the world. \n\nAccording to Hindu teaching, life has four l=\r\negitimate aims. These \nare dharma, artha, kama and moksha=97virtuous conduc=\r\nt, material \ncomfort, enjoyment and liberation. The first three form a cate=\r\ngory \ncalled bhukti, concerned with life in the world. Bhukti is the \nking&#39;=\r\ns immediate concern. Having fled to the forest after his \ndefeat, he has fa=\r\niled to fulfill his moral responsibility, and he \nstill feels attraction fo=\r\nr the privileges of kingship. In other \nwords, he has unfinished business i=\r\nn the world. \n\nHow different is the merchant Samadhi. World-weary and ready=\r\n to \nrenounce the pursuits of dharma, artha and kama, he is ready for \nmoks=\r\nha, spiritual liberation. For his sake, Medhas tells his third \nand final s=\r\ntory, one that points toward realizing our inner \nperfection beyond the wor=\r\nld. The story has a familiar beginning. Two \ndemons, named Shumbha and Nish=\r\numbha, have dispossessed the gods, \nstripped them of their powers and appro=\r\npriated their wealth and \nprivilege. This time the cast of characters is mu=\r\nch larger, and the \ndemons seem more like us than the ones we&#39;ve met previo=\r\nusly. \n\nThe complex scenario passes through three phases as we move \nprogre=\r\nssively inward. The Mother&#39;s successive victories over a \ncolorful cast of =\r\ndemons symbolize our own efforts at purifying our \nconsciousness of every i=\r\nmperfection and misconceived notion. First \nthe myth turns the mirror on ou=\r\nr behavior and motivations. Next we \nare drawn in deeper to observe the min=\r\nd and its workings, and \nfinally we face the fundamental question of who or=\r\n what we are. \n\nWe first meet Shumbha sitting in his palace amid his glitte=\r\nring \nhoard of stolen treasure. The sickening excess of it all reminds us \n=\r\nof our own materialism run amok. Soon the two fawning servants, \nChanda and=\r\n Munda, enter with news that they&#39;ve seen a young woman of \ncaptivating bea=\r\nuty dwelling in the Himalayas. Playing upon Shumbha&#39;s \nvanity, they suggest=\r\n that he who is all-wealthy and all-powerful \nsurely must also possess this=\r\n jewel among women. Little do they know \nthat she is the Devi, the Divine M=\r\nother herself, in her sattvic \naspect. In the same way, we are drawn to the=\r\n world&#39;s enchantments \nbut forget that they are expressions of the Divine. =\r\nShumbha, his \nlust aroused, wants to claim her as his own, just as we want =\r\nto \npossess all that we find attractive and desirable. And just like us, \ni=\r\nf one way fails, Shumbha will try another, and another, with \ngrowing frust=\r\nration. \n\nWhen his smooth-talking messenger, Sugriva, delivers a marriage \n=\r\nproposal, we recognize in him our own lack of complete truthfulness. \nAt fi=\r\nrst the Devi plays along with delicious irony, but after she \nrefuses the m=\r\narriage proposal, Sugriva&#39;s honeyed words turn \nthreatening. If cajoling an=\r\nd deceit don&#39;t work, how about force? \nNext, Shumbha sends a dim- witted th=\r\nug named Dhumralochana to fetch \nthe Devi, kicking and screaming if need be=\r\n. In other words, when we \nset our mind to something, how it affects others=\r\n is not necessarily \nour concern. \n\nWhen Dhumralochana&#39;s brute force fails,=\r\n Shumbha loses all reason and \nsends Chanda and Munda with a huge army to b=\r\nring back &quot;that vile \nwoman&quot; in any way or in any condition whatever. Notic=\r\ne how in \nShumbha&#39;s agitated mind &quot;the jewel among women&quot; is now &quot;that vile=\r\n \nwoman.&quot; What was once so desirable is now the cause of his misery, \nand h=\r\nis desire now is only for the triumph of his own will. Don&#39;t we \nalso overr=\r\neact irrationally when circumstances frustrate our \nintentions? The struggl=\r\ne escalates, and the gently smiling Devi \nDurga calls forth the terrifying,=\r\n emaciated form of Kali and eight \nother fierce goddesses to combat the dem=\r\non hordes. Each one of these \nshaktis is an aspect of her own immense power=\r\n. Each represents a \nhigher function of our own consciousness. \n\nWhen Chand=\r\na and Munda lie dead, a demon named Raktabija strides onto \nthe battlefield=\r\n. He possesses a unique power. Whenever a drop of his \nblood falls to earth=\r\n, another demon of identical size and strength \nsprings up. In the fighting=\r\n, demons proliferate from his spilled \nblood, and utter terror seizes the g=\r\nods, until Durga merely smiles \nand tells Kali to roam the battlefield and =\r\nlap up the drops of blood \nas they fall. The demons arising from it soon pe=\r\nrish between her \ngnashing teeth; and Raktabija, drained of blood, falls de=\r\nad. \n\nThis scene bridges two levels of reality. On one level the \nglistenin=\r\ng red drops of Raktabija&#39;s blood represent the overwhelming \npower of desir=\r\ne. Like a seed, every desire that falls on the fertile \nsoil of our mind gr=\r\nows to maturity and bursts with seeds for the \nnext planting. Every desire =\r\nproduces the seeds of many more, and we \nfind we are never satisfied. The g=\r\nhastly image of Kali, in her red-\neyed, emaciated form known as Chamunda, a=\r\nvidly licking up the drops \nof blood, tells us that desires are best conque=\r\nred when nipped in \nthe bud.\n\nAnother interpretation of the Raktabija episo=\r\nde takes us deeper into \nthe mind. Patanjali, whose Yoga Sutra systematized=\r\n the science of \nmeditation more than two thousand years ago, wrote, &quot;Yoga =\r\nis the \ncontrol of the thought-waves in the mind.&quot; Anyone who has ever sat =\r\n\nto meditate knows how difficult this is. No matter how hard we try \nto con=\r\ncentrate, the mind wanders from here to there. One thought \ngives rise to a=\r\nnother. Raktabija symbolizes this normal, unruly \nstate of human consciousn=\r\ness, where mental energy is scattered and \nunfocused. Chamunda Kali is the =\r\npower of concentrated awareness that \nsubdues the thought-waves and takes u=\r\ns to a calmer, purer state of \nconsciousness. \n\nFinally, only two demons re=\r\nmain, the brothers Shumbha and Nishumbha. \nThey are almost inseparable, and=\r\n the Chandi calls Nishumbha the \nyounger brother who is dearer to Shumbha t=\r\nhan life itself. Shumbha \nrepresents the ego, and Nishumbha is the sense of=\r\n attachment, the \ntag-along sibling that accompanies him everywhere. Earlie=\r\nr we spoke \nabout the ego as a sense of separate selfhood. What we call ego=\r\n is a \nlimiting function of consciousness that in Sanskrit is called \nahamk=\r\nara, literally the &quot;I- maker.&quot; It is both a process of \nconsciousness and t=\r\nhe product of that process. Along with the sense \nof its own individuality,=\r\n this I-making principle has the power of \nself- appropriation that claims =\r\nthings as its own. \n\nHere is where Nishumbha comes in. The attachment he re=\r\npresents is \ncalled mamatva, literally, &quot;my-ness.&quot; In a sense it is the glu=\r\ne that \nholds our identity together. We consciously attach our sense of sel=\r\nf \nto things that are not the Self. We identify with our bodily \ncharacteri=\r\nstics, such as sex, size, shape, color. We define \nourselves by our likes a=\r\nnd dislikes, by the people in our lives and \nour relationships to them, by =\r\nour professions, leisure activities, \nreligious or political affiliations a=\r\nnd countless other factors that \ncombine in ways to make each one of us uni=\r\nque. We use our life&#39;s \nexperiences=97what we do and what happens to us=97t=\r\no shape and reshape \nour identity. And so, our sense of self is constantly =\r\nshifting. \n\nSri Ramakrishna noted how a fine new garment or a new pair of b=\r\noots \ncan change an ordinary man into a swaggering fool, or how money can \n=\r\nmake a humble man arrogant (M., 169). Is our sense of self so \nfragile that=\r\n a slight change of circumstance can cause us to \nreformulate ourselves? Ev=\r\nery factor we identify with is known in \nSanskrit as an upadhi, a defining =\r\nattribute. But upadhi also means a \nlimiting adjunct. We go through life ac=\r\nquiring upadhis, thinking \nthey will make our identity bigger and better, b=\r\nut in reality we are \nmerely adding to our limitations. Attachments to fame=\r\n, influence, \nwealth and possessions only make our burden of personal ident=\r\nity \nheavier. The more we are reined in by our defining attributes, the \nmo=\r\nre we lose sight of our larger sense of self. \n\nWhen we allow our happiness=\r\n and misery to be dictated by things \noutside of and foreign to our true na=\r\nture, we lose our autonomy. \nLet&#39;s consider the third meaning of upadhi: a =\r\nsubstitute, anything \nthat may be taken for something else, an appearance m=\r\nistaken for \nreality. Our defining upadhis are components of a false sense =\r\nof our \nown identity. In the end, they are no more than worthless tokens of=\r\n \nour separation from the infinite Self. But how we hold on to them! \nWhen =\r\nthe Divine Mother finally slays Nishumbha, we get a graphic \nimage of the f=\r\nerocity of the struggle. Just when she has the demon \ncornered, he sprouts =\r\nten thousand arms with ten thousand grasping \nhands. This picture of ugly d=\r\nesperation illustrates just how \ndesperate we are not to let go. \n\nEven wit=\r\nh Nishumbha out of the way, there remains the ego-sense \nitself, denuded of=\r\n all borrowed attributes. Now Shumbha, alone, \nstands face to face with the=\r\n Mother. He points to her companion \ngoddesses and chides her for relying o=\r\nn the strength of others in \nthe fight. She answers, &quot;I am alone here in th=\r\ne world. =85 These are \nbut projections of my own power=85 (DM 10.5). &quot; To =\r\nprove her point, \nthe Shaktis vanish into her, and she then slays Shumbha. =\r\nThis final \nvictory represents the realization of the true Self. \n\nThere is=\r\n no way to describe this immediate, unmediated knowledge of \nthe atman; but=\r\n that has not stopped mystics of every religious \ntradition throughout hist=\r\nory from trying to express the \ninexpressible experience of the Divine. In =\r\nthe Svetasvatara \nUpanishad, a text certainly known to whoever composed the=\r\n Chandi, \nthe enlightened seer proclaims, &quot;I have known the unchanging, \npr=\r\nimeval One, the indwelling Self of all, everywhere present and all-\npervadi=\r\nng, whom the wise declare to be free from birth and eternal \n(SU 3.21).&quot; \n\n=\r\nMedhas then relates how the gods again praised the Divine Mother in \na four=\r\nth and final hymn. Three of its verses (DM 11.10-12) are well \nknown in Ved=\r\nanta circles. They are sung every evening around the \nworld in temples of t=\r\nhe Ramakrishna Order as the arati hymn &quot;Om \nSarva Mangala Mangalye.&quot; Then, =\r\nMedhas sends his two disciples to the \nbank of a river, where they meditate=\r\n and worship the Mother \ndevotedly. After three years she appears to them a=\r\nnd offers each a \nboon. Suratha, who we remember has unfinished business, a=\r\nsks for the \nreturn of his earthly kingdom, followed by an imperishable kin=\r\ngdom \nin the next life. The merchant Samadhi, on the other hand, has grown =\r\n\nwise and dispassionate. He asks for the knowledge that will dissolve \nthe =\r\nbondage of worldly existence.\n\nThrough the Mother&#39;s grace, each boon is gra=\r\nnted, in keeping with \nthe Chandi&#39;s teaching that the Divine Mother is \nbhu=\r\nktimuktipradayini, &quot;the bestower of worldly enjoyment and \nliberation (DM11=\r\n.7).&quot; How conversant Sri Ramakrishna was with the \nteachings of the Chandi =\r\nis made clear in a conversation he had with \nmembers of the Brahmo Samaj in=\r\n the autumn of 1882. In a single \nparagraph that summarizes the essential m=\r\nessage of the Chandi, \nRamakrishna said, &quot;Bondage and liberation are both o=\r\nf Her making. By \nher maya worldly people become entangled in `woman and go=\r\nld,&#39; and \nagain, through her grace they attain liberation. She is called th=\r\ne \nSavior, and the Remover of the bondage that binds one to the world \n(M.,=\r\n 136).&quot; \n\nA short while later he added, &quot;I tell you the truth: there is \nno=\r\nthing wrong in your being in the world. But you must direct your \nmind towa=\r\nrd God; otherwise you will not succeed. Do your duty with \none hand and wit=\r\nh the other hold to God. After the duty is over, you \nwill hold to God with=\r\n both hands (M., 137-138).&quot; On another occasion \nSri Ramakrishna said, &quot;Som=\r\netimes I find that the universe is \nsaturated with the Consciousness of God=\r\n, as the earth is soaked with \nwater in the rainy season (M., 260).&quot; This c=\r\nalls to mind the \nChandi&#39;s third hymn, known as the Aparajitastuti, [Hymn t=\r\no the \nInvincible Goddess]. \n\nUnlike the three other hymns, which are intim=\r\nately connected to the \nforegoing battle narratives, this one is an ecstati=\r\nc celebration of \nthe Divine Mother&#39;s presence in the world. It reminds us =\r\nsimply to \nsee divinity everywhere around us, because the Mother abides in =\r\nall \nbeings as intelligence, order, forgiveness, modesty, peace, beauty, \ng=\r\nood fortune, compassion, contentment, and in countless other ways. \nWe need=\r\n only to remember her presence; and as a sign of her grace, \nit is she hers=\r\nelf who abides in us even in the form of memory. \n\nWe conclude with two ver=\r\nses from this hymn: &quot;To her who presides \nover the elements and the senses =\r\nand is ever present in all beings, \nto the all-pervading Devi, salutations =\r\nagain and again. To her who \npervades this entire world and abides in the f=\r\norm of consciousness, \nsalutation to her, salutation to her, salutation to =\r\nher, again and \nagain (DM 5.77-80).&quot; \n\n\n\n"}}
