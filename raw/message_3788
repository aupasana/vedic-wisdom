Rao \nSent: Thursday, February 25, 2=\r\n010 11:28 AM\nSubject: Re: Aghora books by Svoboda (Re: Chandi Homam and Sri=\r\n Vidya)\n\n\nDear Narasimha and others,\n\nJust further to our conversation on t=\r\nhis topic last night,\nIf one looks into the mind, one finds that sex is ass=\r\nociated with naked men/women, etc. The mind perceives a woman or man of the=\r\n opposite sex in a different way. This comes from millions of janmas and sa=\r\nmskaras. \n\nMy spiritual father &quot;Vimalananda&quot; used to say in a slightly diff=\r\nerent context that he believes in Sampradaha or incineration.\nI applied it =\r\nto this as well and it works quite well. \nTwo things are going to be useful=\r\n, \n1. Continue your mantra during the act and it will act as a continuation=\r\n of your sadhana.\n2. If your partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do not =\r\nbe disheartened by failure initially. As time goes on, the thing in your mi=\r\nnd which thinks of sex is incinerated and slowly you find that a naked fema=\r\nle(or male as may be the case) body is like a landscape picture just like a=\r\nny other picture made by Her of nature(like Niagara falls, or Angkor Wat, y=\r\nou need not be disturbed by it, you can certainly feel that the picture is =\r\nvery beautiful but you need not be aroused by it). In fact Striya Samasta S=\r\nakala jagatsu, tyaikiya.......\nOnce this stage is reached then the mind cea=\r\nses to think of sex all the while.\nYes you may still encounter it, but that=\r\n is another story.\n\n\n\nManish\n\n\n\n \nOn Thu, Feb 25, 2010 at 2:24 PM, Narasimh=\r\na P.V.R.

If many people are=\r\n doing homam by themselves today, he played an important role in it.\n\n  Whe=\r\nn Manish wanted to do Shata Chandi Homam, Swami Sathasivom invited us to do=\r\n it at the Kaalikaambaal temple in Chennai where he is the head priest. Whe=\r\nn I asked how much it will cost, he said &quot;I will arrange everything. You an=\r\nd Manish just come and sit for sankalpam&quot;. It was during the Shata Chandi h=\r\nomam that Manish had a darshan of the Mother, who commanded to spread homam=\r\n and said She will arrange all the resources needed. Swami Sathasivom had s=\r\neveral books on homam gifted to us by a friend of his on the next day, with=\r\nout Manish telling anything about the Mother&#39;s command to anyone. He also g=\r\nifted a homa kundam to me enabling me to experiment with homam and prepare =\r\nmyself for creating the manuals.\n\n  He is a priest in the Sivacharya tradit=\r\nion of Tamil Nadu and his father Sri Sambamurthi Sivacharya was a very resp=\r\nected Sivacharya who trained a lot of priests and consecrated many temples.=\r\n Swami Sathasivom is one of the rare priests we find today, who is not only=\r\n a priest but also a yogi and a sadhaka. He has childlike innocence, simpli=\r\ncty, rare humility and love for all. He conducts himself with detachment by=\r\n seeking nothing and avoiding nothing. He conducted some of the best homams=\r\n and poojas I have witnessed. He has been on mouna vratam (vow of silence) =\r\nfor more than a year and communicates by writing (saying mantras in pooja/h=\r\nomam is an exception).\n\n  *        *        *\n\n  I can give an analogy for =\r\nthe last point regarding an aghora&#39;s way to overcome any weakness for sex t=\r\nhat may be left in the mind (which may make sexual thoughts arise in the mi=\r\nnd now and then).\n\n  Suppose you are trying to read a book and a friend is =\r\ndistracting you and irritating you by talking about something else. You can=\r\n try to ignore him and focus on the book. Alternatively, you can also try t=\r\no get him interested in the book and call him to read the book along with y=\r\nou. In the beginning, he may still distract you and make it more difficult =\r\nto read. But, it is possible that he also likes the book and starts enjoyin=\r\ng the book along with you and stops distracting you.\n\n  If meditation is li=\r\nke reading a book, weakness for sex is like the friend and sexual thoughts =\r\nthat arise in the mind are like the distractions caused by the friend, then=\r\n aghora&#39;s sadhana I mentioned is like getting the friend to read the book a=\r\nlong with you.\n\n  However, as I said, there are no guarantees. This friend =\r\nmay get interested in the book and stop distracting you, or he may continue=\r\n to distract you and make it worse by being right next to you through the r=\r\neading. It is tricky to know how long one should try before deciding that i=\r\nt is not working. That is why we say that aghora is not for everyone.\n\n  Be=\r\nst regards,\n  Narasimha\n  -------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------\n    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish=\r\n Writings,\n  &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarp=\r\nana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that m=\r\nake a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n       Spirituality: http://gr=\r\noups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/JyotishWritings\n  ----------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n\n    ----- Original Message ----- \n    From: swamisat=\r\nhasivom@... \n    To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n    Sent: Wed=\r\nnesday, February 24, 2010 11:48 PM\n    Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Aghora b=\r\nooks by Svoboda (Re: Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya)\n    Namaskarams  \n\n    Thi=\r\ns reply is amazing and true \n    Bow down to yr knowledge given by ma durga=\r\n Mahalakshmi .\n    I was stunned by this answers ,its answers to many quest=\r\nions in our inner mind .\n    I stopped all and read this reply almost 5 th =\r\ntime .each time some new points I am catching from in it ,\n    Nandhi \n\n   =\r\n Sent from my BlackBerry=AE smartphone\n\n\n----------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------------------\n\n    From: &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

The idea is that one is not bound by Maayaa once one *fully* unde=\r\nrstands and appreciates it.\n\n    Chandipath consists of symbolic stories of=\r\n wars that the divine Mother fought, which explain how one can fight and ov=\r\nercome various weaknesses that typically bind one in Maayaa. Reciting these=\r\n stories on a regular basis will promote the fighting spirit within one tha=\r\nt fights these weaknesses.\n\n    There is nothing wrong in understanding Maa=\r\nyaa and trying to fight/overcome it at the same time. One aspect of the Mot=\r\nher creates Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you experience good and =\r\nbad in that Maayaa. One aspect of the Mother makes you understand Maayaa to=\r\n overcome it. One aspect of the Mother makes you fight and overcome it. Whe=\r\nn one realizes Self at the end, irrespective of the path taken, one finally=\r\n sees that all these are aspects of a Single Mother who is also essentially=\r\n true Self.\n\n    *        *        *\n\n    &gt; Also, I have started to read th=\r\ne Aghora series books by Dr. Robert\n    &gt; Svobodha. For now I have very mix=\r\ned feelings on the subject.\n    &gt; Perhaps I need to read more! \n\n    Aghora=\r\n series books by Svoboda are good, but Aghora is not everyone&#39;s cup of tea.=\r\n It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n\n    Ghora means terrible. Aghora mea=\r\nns &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names of Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true Aghora =\r\n(aghori) does not see anything as terrible or bad or impure and sees all as=\r\n impermanent manifestations of god and tries to focus the thinking of the m=\r\nind on what is permanent (god) always, instead of impermanent manifestation=\r\ns of god.\n\n    When someone dies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai=\r\n&quot; while carrying the dead body to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of L=\r\nord Rama is true and everything else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind=\r\n oneself that life and death are just a temporary illusion and only the Lor=\r\nd is real. But the question is: why should we remind ourselves of this ulti=\r\nmate truth only when someone dies? When someone praises us for a supposedly=\r\n great thing we have done and we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t w=\r\ne tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing we did and the praises a=\r\nre temporary illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on te=\r\nmporary illusions&quot;? When we feel attracted to something beautiful and want =\r\nto get it, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that s=\r\neems beautiful and other things that seem not so beautiful are temporary il=\r\nlusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusio=\r\nns&quot;? When someone attacks and abuses us and we are about to feel sad or ang=\r\nry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are tempora=\r\nry illusions. Only the Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary il=\r\nlusions&quot;?&quot;\n\n    A true Aghora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. =\r\nHis mind rejects all *impermanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwel=\r\nling* on them by classifying them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and =\r\nthinking about them with attraction/aversion) and tries to find and focus o=\r\nn what is permanent. But he takes it to extremes.\n\n    *        *        *\n=\r\n\n    Vedanta says &quot;all is Self. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An=\r\n aghora pursues it practically. If feces and fruit are both impermenant ill=\r\nusions and the only permanent reality within them is the Self, he questions=\r\n why he can eat fruit but not feces. So he may try a ritual where feces is =\r\neaten. But, please remember that eating feces is not the main point. Percei=\r\nving Self in the food being consumed and not perceiving an impermanent mani=\r\nfestation of Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main point. For example, eatin=\r\ng feces with disgust serves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s mind is dwellin=\r\ng on the impermenant manifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A suc=\r\ncessful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling on th=\r\ne fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and will not feel =\r\nany kind of disgust. He will be thinking that he is Self and he is eating S=\r\nelf.\n\n    Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions really. He chants=\r\n vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am =\r\nconsuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not=\r\n be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the=\r\n impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinj=\r\nal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the pe=\r\nrmanent (Self).\n\n    Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves =\r\nthe same truth and trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impul=\r\nse. But aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation where failure res=\r\nults in a very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive i=\r\nn forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Ve=\r\ndic verse that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty ladd=\r\nus and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Sel=\r\nf while eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-=\r\nso-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other=\r\n hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces=\r\n, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very b=\r\nad dual experience may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n\n    Howe=\r\nver, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by everyone merely =\r\nbecause of an incentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.\n\n   =\r\n *        *        *\n\n    Take another simple example. Suppose someone is d=\r\noing a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for =\r\nsex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in th=\r\ne middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n\n=\r\n    A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away fr=\r\nom sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts.=\r\n After all, such thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if one keep=\r\ns celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the =\r\nmind does not return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fasci=\r\nnation some minds may have for sex?\n\n    An aghora will take it to an extre=\r\nme. He will try to fix the root cause and remove fascination from the mind.=\r\n Instead of keeping sadhana and sex as two different activities (one pure a=\r\nnd the other impure), he may combine them into one without such distinction=\r\ns of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting =\r\nnaked on his lap and then does his japam. In the beginning, this may titill=\r\nate and result in sex. He may think that his sadhana is being made impure. =\r\nBut, suppose he persists to do japam like that for several months/years. Ev=\r\nentually, mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing =\r\nsomething impure. He may no longer feel titillation. The association in his=\r\n mind between nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures p=\r\nhysically or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke though=\r\nts of meditation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in t=\r\nhe head may not lead to denser and denser thoughts relating to sex and dist=\r\nraction in sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to meditation. Afte=\r\nr spending so much time in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the a=\r\nttraction and thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken =\r\ndown. Overall, the person&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may be gone la=\r\nrgely.\n\n    Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and t=\r\nhe thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of=\r\n these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine those str=\r\nuctures.\n\n    However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also =\r\npossible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex a=\r\nnd thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of m=\r\neditation everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/=\r\nready to start with.\n\n    *        *        *\n\n    Bottomline is that an ag=\r\nhora takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high stakes fight =\r\nwith them, whereas a normal person may push the problems under the carpet a=\r\nnd fight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is not applicabl=\r\ne to all.\n\n    *        *        *\n\n    Like Manish said in a mail earlier,=\r\n &quot;what is Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to =\r\nunderstand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a hig=\r\nh stakes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many m=\r\nay feel aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it =\r\nbased on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.=\r\n Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract =\r\nsome people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora =\r\nand Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how on=\r\ne absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasant.\n=\r\n\n    BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual pat=\r\nhs and explains the basic reality. It may be interesting to read in the con=\r\ntext of aghora.\n\n    http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/361=\r\n\n\n    Best regards,\n    Narasimha\n    -------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------------\n      Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Le=\r\nssons, Jyotish Writings,\n    &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homa=\r\nm and Pitri Tarpana:\n                      http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n =\r\n        Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org \n         S=\r\npirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n      Jyotish writi=\r\nngs: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n    --------------------=\r\n-----------------------------------------------\n\n      ----- Original Messa=\r\nge ----- \n      From: Nagraj Kota \n      To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n=\r\n      Sent: Thursday, February 18, 2010 11:58 AM\n      Subject: Re: [vedic-=\r\nwisdom] Re: Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya\n\n            Dear Narasimhagaru,\n\n  =\r\n          Thank you for your reply. \n\n            I understand that Chandi =\r\nand Lalita are two different forms of the Universal Mother. But what I am t=\r\nrying to understand is that how to worship both forms simultaneously. For i=\r\nnstance, Sri Muththuswamy Diskshitar, was a great composer (one of the Divi=\r\nne Trinity of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who =\r\nwas a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis mentio=\r\nn great details about all the nine avaranas and different forms of the divi=\r\nne mother as one goes through each avarana. In the Dhyana Krithi of those, =\r\nin the very first line he says, &#39;Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, ChanDike&#39;.=\r\n That line tells me that even through Sri Vidya one can worship Chandi Ma, =\r\nin that form. \n\n            So my question was in that perspective. Anyway,=\r\n your reply was a great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surround=\r\ned by layers of duality! I never thought in those terms. \n\n            I ha=\r\nve started reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise of reading it flu=\r\nently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I plan to do during navarat=\r\nri of 2010.

My performing =\r\na Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspiring. On the other hand, =\r\nthere are some people who do not know Sanskrit at all and took 4 hours to r=\r\nead Chandipath with great difficulty in their first attempt. THEY are doing=\r\n Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours now. THAT is awe-inspiri=\r\nng.\n\n              Integrating various sadhanas is a personal problem that =\r\nneeds a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea to pick one or two=\r\n sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead of splitting the tim=\r\ne between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is better to dig =\r\n10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten places, if one want=\r\ns to find water.\n\n              One possibility is to do a homam and then m=\r\neditate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is attached t=\r\no.\n\n              I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, fro=\r\nm the little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic representatio=\r\nn of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unrave=\r\nl the layer of duality and realize Self.\n\n              Lalita means gentle=\r\n one and Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teaches you =\r\ngently, you will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern and strict=\r\n, you will learn fast (provided you can face the strictness). Both are vali=\r\nd paths.\n\n              Best regards,\n              Narasimha\n             =\r\n ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n         =\r\n     Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n       =\r\n       &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n =\r\n             http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n              Films that make =\r\na difference: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\n              Spirituality: http:/=\r\n/groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n              Jyotish writings: htt=\r\np://groups. yahoo.com/ group/JyotishWri tings\n              ------------ --=\r\n------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n\n              --- On Fri=\r\n, 2/5/10, nagraj@sbcglobal. net &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n\n            =\r\n  From: nagraj@sbcglobal. net &lt;nagraj_um@yahoo. com&gt;\n              Subject:=\r\n [vedic-wisdom] Chandi Homam and Sri Vidya\n              To: vedic-wisdom@ =\r\nyahoogroups. com\n              Date: Friday, February 5, 2010, 11:51 PM\n\n  =\r\n            Dear Sri Narasimharao garu,\n\n              I am very much in aw=\r\ne after I learnt that you do chandi homam everyday. You also wrote that it =\r\ntakes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. How can you ac=\r\ncomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? Also, in my case, =\r\nI do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 1=\r\n08 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deeparad=\r\nhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes daily ritual. P=\r\nlus I sometimes do special rituals several times a week, that takes about 1=\r\n to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along with homam? Is Sri vidyo=\r\npasana different from Chandi homam? Could you please explain what is sri Vi=\r\ndya and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn what the Devi =\r\nMahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in Sri Vidya, because=\r\n I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Mutht=\r\nhuswami Dikshitar recently.\n\n              Nagraj Kota\n\n           \n      .=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00E9_01CAB65C.0DEBE3D0\r\nContent-Type: text/html;\n\tcharset=&quot;iso-8859-1&quot;\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC &quot;-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.0 Transitional//EN&quot;&gt;\n&lt;HTML&gt;&lt;HEAD&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;META http-equiv=3DContent-Type content=3D&quot;text/html; charset=3Diso-8859-1=\r\n&quot;&gt;\n&lt;META content=3D&quot;MSHTML 6.00.2900.3660&quot; name=3DGENERATOR&gt;\n&lt;STYLE&gt;&lt;/STYLE=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;/HEAD&gt;\n&lt;BODY bgColor=3D#ffffff&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Namaste=\r\n friends,&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;=\r\n\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Here is a comment from Manish on this top=\r\nic.

Continue your m=\r\nantra during the act and it will act as a continuation of \nyour sadhana.&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;2. If your partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do not be dishea=\r\nrtened by \nfailure initially. As time goes on, the&nbsp;thing in your mind =\r\nwhich thinks of \nsex is incinerated and slowly you find that a naked female=\r\n(or male as&nbsp;may \nbe the case)&nbsp;body is like a landscape picture ju=\r\nst like any other picture \nmade by Her of nature(like Niagara falls, or Ang=\r\nkor Wat, you need not be \ndisturbed by it, you can certainly&nbsp;feel that=\r\n the picture&nbsp;is very \nbeautiful&nbsp;but you need not be aroused by it=\r\n).

If feces and \n   =\r\n fruit are both impermenant illusions and the only permanent reality within=\r\n \n    them is the Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but not feces. So=\r\n he may \n    try a ritual where feces is eaten.&nbsp;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAr=\r\nial size=3D2&gt;But, \n    please remember that eating feces is not the main po=\r\nint. Perceiving Self in \n    the food being consumed and not perceiving an =\r\nimpermanent manifestation of \n    Self (feces, fruit etc), is the main poin=\r\nt. For example, eating feces with \n    disgust serves no purpose, for such =\r\na person&#39;s mind is dwelling on the \n    impermenant manifestation of Self (=\r\n&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A successful \n    Aghora may be eating feces, but=\r\n the mind will not be dwelling on the fact \n    that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; w=\r\nith certain properties and will not feel any kind \n    of disgust. He will =\r\nbe thinking that he is Self and he is eating \n    Self.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAr=\r\nial size=3D2&gt;Of course, a vedantin also has the same notions \n    really. H=\r\ne chants vedic verses when eating food, which essentially mean &quot;I \n    am S=\r\nelf and I am consuming Self&quot;. Nevertheless, such chanting may merely be \n  =\r\n  a ritual and not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his min=\r\nd \n    may dwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;=\r\n, &quot;a \n    badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; etc) and wa=\r\nver from \n    the focus on the permanent (Self).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FON=\r\nT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling \n    themselves the same t=\r\nruth and trying to absorb that truth into every thought \n    and impulse. B=\r\nut aghora is putting himself in an extreme situation where \n    failure res=\r\nults in a very bad dual experience. That can in fact work as an \n    incent=\r\nive in forcing one to transcend duality! In the case of a person who \n    c=\r\nhants a Vedic verse that says &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats =\r\n\n    tasty laddus and nicely made food, the fallout from failing to absorb =\r\nthe \n    mind in Self while eating is not too bad. If the mind dwells on th=\r\ne nice (or \n    even not-so-nice) taste of a laddu or other food, what is t=\r\nhe big deal? On \n    the other hand, if the mind fails to absorb in Self an=\r\nd dwells on the taste \n    of feces, it will be so disgusting. Thus, the fa=\r\nct that failure results in a \n    very bad dual experience may act as an in=\r\ncentive in succeeding \n    quickly.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAria=\r\nl size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;However=\r\n, difficult tasks cannot necessarily be \n    accomplished by everyone merel=\r\ny because of an incentive.

Suppose someone is doing a lot of sadhana, \n    like japam =\r\nand homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind \n    is dw=\r\nelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of sadhana and \n    =\r\nthat is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;A regular person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind=\r\n away \n    from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming s=\r\nuch \n    thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and distract one=\r\n. Even if \n    one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarantee that =\r\nthe fascination \n    in the mind does not return to bite one after that. Bu=\r\nt, how to overcome the \n    fascination some minds may have for sex?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;An aghora will take it to an extreme. He wil=\r\nl try to fix the root cause \n    and remove fascination from the mind. Inst=\r\nead of keeping sadhana and sex as \n    two different activities (one pure a=\r\nnd the other impure), he may combine \n    them into one without such distin=\r\nctions of pure vs impure. Suppose an aghora \n    sits naked with his partne=\r\nr sitting naked on his lap and then does his \n    japam. In the beginning, =\r\nthis may titillate and result in sex. He may think \n    that his sadhana is=\r\n being made impure. But, suppose he persists to do japam \n    like that for=\r\n several months/years. Eventually, mind may be reprogrammed. He \n    may no=\r\n longer feel that he is doing something impure. He may no longer feel \n    =\r\ntitillation. The association in his mind between nakedness and sex may be \n=\r\n    broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentally may no longer=\r\n \n    evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. Any small th=\r\noughts \n    related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead to d=\r\nenser and \n    denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana, =\r\nbut they may now \n    take the mind back to meditation. After spending so m=\r\nuch time in meditation \n    while sitting naked intimately, the attraction =\r\nand thrill mind may feel for \n    nakedness or intimacy may be broken down.=\r\n Overall, the person&#39;s fascination \n    and weakness for sex may be gone la=\r\nrgely.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;Mind has a lot of conditioning =\r\nbased on prior experiences and the \n    thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora =\r\nsometimes tries to break down some of \n    these structures by engaging in =\r\ncertain practices that undermine those \n    structures.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbs=\r\np;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;However, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is a=\r\nlso possible \n    that the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely =\r\nfor sex and thinks \n    of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of=\r\n thinking of meditation \n    everytime he sees naked partner), if one was n=\r\not serious/sincere/ready to \n    start with.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n  =\r\n  &lt;DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DI=\r\nV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and wea=\r\nknesses \n    head on and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a n=\r\normal person \n    may push the problems under the carpet and fight slowly a=\r\nnd with low stakes. \n    Such a risky strategy is not applicable to all.&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;\n    =\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n; \n    *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;what is Vedanta and \n    w=\r\nhat is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to understand and absorb \n=\r\n    Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high stakes war plan.=\r\n \n    However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may feel avers=\r\nion. \n    More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it based on=\r\n a wrong \n    understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.&nb=\r\nsp;Aghora \n    stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* a=\r\nttract some \n    people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenet=\r\ns of Aghora and \n    Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to a=\r\nccelerates how one \n    absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making fai=\r\nlure very \n    unpleasant.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;BTW, the fo=\r\nllowing mail gives a good analogy for various spiritual \n    paths and expl=\r\nains the basic reality. It may be interesting to read in the \n    context o=\r\nf aghora.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/361&quot; \n    target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.y=\r\nahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/361&lt;/A&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAri=\r\nal size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;Best \n    regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;---------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp; \n    F=\r\nree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Do It \n  =\r\n  Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri \n    Tarpana:&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n    &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.or=\r\ng/&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;&lt;FONT \n    face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;http://www.VedicAstrol=\r\noger.org&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT \n    face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp; Films that make a difference: \n    &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A href=3D&quot;http://saraswati=\r\nfilms.org/&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \n    size=3D2&gt;http://Saraswa=\r\ntiFilms.org&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt; \n    &lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp;&nbsp; Spirituality: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;&lt;FONT \n    face=3DArial \n    size=3D2&gt;http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT \n    face=3DArial=\r\n size=3D2&gt;&nbsp; Jyotish writings: &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;A \n    href=3D&quot;http://groups.yah=\r\noo.com/group/JyotishWritings&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;&lt;FONT \n    face=3DArial \n    =\r\nsize=3D2&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT =\r\n\n    face=3DArial \n    size=3D2&gt;-------------------------------------------=\r\n------------------------&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT size=3D2&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D=\r\nArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;BLOCKQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDE=\r\nR-LEFT: #000000 2px solid&quot;&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV class=\r\n=3Dh5&gt;\n      &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;BACKGROUND: #e4e4e4; FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;From:&lt;/=\r\nB&gt; &lt;A \n      title=3Dnagraj_um@... href=3D&quot;mailto:nagraj_um@...=\r\n&quot; \n      target=3D_blank&gt;Nagraj Kota&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 1=\r\n0pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;To:&lt;/B&gt; &lt;A \n      title=3Dvedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n     =\r\n href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&quot; \n      target=3D_blank&gt;vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/A&gt; &lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV style=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;=\r\nSent:&lt;/B&gt; Thursday, February 18, 2010 \n      11:58 AM&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV styl=\r\ne=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;&lt;B&gt;Subject:&lt;/B&gt; Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: \n      Chandi=\r\n Homam and Sri Vidya&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;SPAN&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/F=\r\nONT&gt;&lt;/SPAN&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;\n      &lt;DIV&gt;\n   =\r\n   &lt;P&gt;\n      &lt;TABLE cellSpacing=3D0 cellPadding=3D0 border=3D0&gt;\n        &lt;TB=\r\nODY&gt;\n        &lt;TR&gt;\n          &lt;TD vAlign=3Dtop&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;\n           =\r\n &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV class=3Dh5&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;Dear Narasimhaga=\r\nru,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n            &lt;DIV&gt;Thank you for your reply. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT fa=\r\nce=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;I understand that Chandi an=\r\nd Lalita are two different forms of \n            the Universal Mother.&nbsp=\r\n;But what I am trying to \n            understand&nbsp;is that how to worshi=\r\np both forms simultaneously. \n            For&nbsp;instance, Sri Muththuswa=\r\nmy Diskshitar, was a great composer \n            (one of the Divine Trinity=\r\n of Carnatic Music along with Thyagaraja \n            and Shyama Sastry), w=\r\nho was a self-realized Sri Vidyopasaka.

Anyway, your reply was \n   =\r\n         a great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by \n=\r\n            layers of duality! I never thought in those terms. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n     =\r\n       &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;I have =\r\nstarted reading Durga Saptashati, just to get practise \n            of read=\r\ning it fluently, before I start to do chandi homam, which I \n            pl=\r\nan to do during navaratri of 2010.

My performing a Chandi homam ev=\r\neryday should hardly be \n              awe-inspiring. On the other hand, th=\r\nere are some people who do not \n              know Sanskrit at all and took=\r\n 4 hours to read Chandipath with \n              great difficulty in their f=\r\nirst attempt. THEY are doing Chandi \n              homam everyday and it ta=\r\nkes them 1.5 hours now. THAT is \n              awe-inspiring.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Integr=\r\nating various sadhanas is a personal \n              problem that needs a pe=\r\nrsonal solution. In general, it is a good \n              idea to pick one o=\r\nr two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on \n              them, instead =\r\nof splitting the time between ten things. As \n              Ramakrishna Par=\r\namahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres in one \n              place ra=\r\nther than dig one metre in ten places, if one wants to \n              find =\r\nwater.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One possibility is to do a homam and then \n              medi=\r\ntate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is \n            =\r\n  attached to.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. \n       =\r\n       However, from the little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a \n =\r\n             symblic representation of the layers of duality surrounding Se=\r\nlf. \n              Its purpose, too, is to unravel the layer of duality and=\r\n realize \n              Self.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lalita means gentle one and Chandi mea=\r\nns the fierce \n              one. If you have a mother who teaches you gent=\r\nly, you will learn \n              slowly. If you have a mother who is stern=\r\n and strict, you will \n              learn fast (provided you can face the =\r\nstrictness).

You also wrote that it=\r\n takes \n              about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam=\r\n. How can you \n              accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a=\r\n short time? Also, \n              in my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108=\r\n Gayatri (20 \n              minutes)+ganapathi mantra japam 108 times(10 mi=\r\nnutes), a short \n              rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari, a deepara=\r\ndhana etc. (5-10 \n              minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes=\r\n daily ritual. Plus I \n              sometimes do special rituals several t=\r\nimes a week, that takes \n              about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to =\r\nintegrate these along with \n              homam? Is Sri vidyopasana differe=\r\nnt from Chandi homam? Could you \n              please explain what is sri V=\r\nidya and how it is to be learnt? I am \n              very motivated to lear=\r\nn what the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but \n              I also have keen=\r\n interest in Sri Vidya, because I am a musician \n              also and lea=\r\nrnt all the nava-avarna krithis of Great Muththuswami \n              Dikshi=\r\ntar recently.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nagraj \n              Kota&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;.&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/B=\r\nLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n    &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n    &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;\n    &lt;P&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;P&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial siz=\r\ne=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/BODY&gt;&lt;/HTML&gt;\n\r\n------=_NextPart_000_00E9_01CAB65C.0DEBE3D0--\r\n\n"}}
