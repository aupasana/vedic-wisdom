Where in our scriptures =\r\ndoes it say that every thing has 3 (adhi bhautic, adhidevik and aadhyatmic)=\r\n interpretations? Mahabharat is &quot;history&quot;. How can we say that every thing =\r\nmentioned therein can be, or must be, interpreted 3 ways. The notion that o=\r\nur scriptures have a hidden agenda which only pundits understand and can in=\r\nterpret seems stretching the truth. A simple Krishn- Sandeepan story gets a=\r\n new twist! \n\nShrimad Bhagvat is a detailed and voluminous book dealing wit=\r\nh Shri Krishna&#39;s life. It gives the names of the entire clan of Gopis and y=\r\net does not mention Radha Rani even once! \n\nDurga Saptshati is included in =\r\nMarkandeya Puran. Where does it say that Mahishasur also represents our tam=\r\nsic tendencies and Raktbeej represents our multitude of desires. \n\nSo, the =\r\nsimple question: where is the authority for 3 way translations?\n\nSent from =\r\nmy iPad\nRamesh Sharma\n"}}
