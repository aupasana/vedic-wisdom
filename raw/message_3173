If one has a deep attachment \nto the body, mind may be attache=\r\nd to the body even after death, even after \nthe connection of the karmendri=\r\nyas and jnanendriyas of the mind to the \nphysical body is cut off. Then wha=\r\nt happens to the body does affect the mind \nand its further\n progress.\n\n*=\r\n=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nWhen one takes sannyasa, i.e renounces =\r\nmaterial world, the last rites are to \nbe done symbolically. After that, on=\r\ne is dead symbolically. However, if one \ndoes not have true renunciation an=\r\nd detachment from body, relatives and \nother material objects, there is no =\r\npoint in taking sannyasa or doing \nsymbolic last rites. Even if one does it=\r\n, mind may still be attached to the \nbody. If last rites are not done after=\r\n death, even a sannyasi&#39;s mind may \nhave problems. On the other hand, a tru=\r\ne sannyasi who is absolutely detached \nfrom the body even when alive will f=\r\nly high when mind is finally freed from \nthe body at death.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nOne cannot control what others do with one&#39;s body a=\r\nfter one leaves it. So \nthe wisest course of action would be to develop det=\r\nachment even when alive.\n \nDivert the concern for the well-being of the bod=\r\ny towards other people. Do \nbare minimum to keep the body alive and not be =\r\noverly concerned about it. \nWhen you meditate, think only of god and try to=\r\n forget that there is a body \nthat you occupy. Even if leg hurts or neck it=\r\nches, try to forget about it. \nIf you ignore body for a while, it will cry =\r\nout for attention, like an \nimmature child who needs attention. If you give=\r\n it attention, you cannot \nexperience god. But, as you ignore body more, bo=\r\ndy will try more to get your \nattention (like an immature child who needs a=\r\nttention)! However, if you \npersist, body will have to eventually give up! =\r\nTHAT is when one can absorb \nthe mind fully in god.\n\nIf one experiences tha=\r\nt often while alive, that experience helps immensely \nat death. When the mi=\r\nnd leaves the body for the last time, one can focus \nmind on god and ignore=\r\n the attention grabbing cries for help from the\n body. \nOne who successfull=\r\ny focuses mind on god when the last moment comes is \nliberated and gets saa=\r\nyujya or moksha. On the other hand, one who wavers \nfrom the focus on god a=\r\nnd lets mind turn towards the plight of the dying \nbody gets stuck.\n\nTo a y=\r\nogi, each session of deep meditation is like a dress rehearsal of the \nlast=\r\n moment! Death is not to be feared. If faced correctly, it is the moment \no=\r\nf final liberation. Life is meant to be a practice for it!\n\nInstead of worr=\r\nying about body and its last rites, let every ritual be a \nlast rite! I sug=\r\ngest that one should practice detachment and develop the \nability to absolu=\r\ntely ignore the pitiful cries of the body for attention as \none tries to fo=\r\ncus the mind on god and succeed in absorbing the mind in god \nwhen meditati=\r\nng. If one practices that, the issue of who does last rites and \nwhat rites=\r\n becomes irrelevant.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0\n =A0 =A0 *\n\nOf course, one =\r\nwho performs brilliantly in dress rehearsals may still forget \none&#39;s lines =\r\nor put a wrong expression when playing the drama finally on the \nbig stage.=\r\n Similarly, a yogi who has overcome the attachment to body and \nabsorbed th=\r\ne mind perfectly in god many times may still waver at the last \nmoment and =\r\nthink of body or something else that is impermenant and be \nreborn.\n\nHoweve=\r\nr, all that is in our control is to practice and prepare for the last \nmome=\r\nnt.\n\n*=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n\nYou are lucky. There are many Hin=\r\ndus who do not experience anything like \nwhat you described.
