However the white part is j=\r\nuicy and when I experimented with it, it does not burn even after staying i=\r\nn the fire for quite a long time! Today is the third day that I kept the co=\r\nconut slices open to dry, but they still are not dry enough to burn. I gues=\r\ns they might take even 8-10 or even 15 days.\n\nBut I don&#39;t want to wait that=\r\n long to start my homam.\n\nNarasimha Ji, you have mentioned that fire can be=\r\n done with wood instead of coconut. So if I do the fire with twig or wood, =\r\nthe only time I would need coconut is for Purnahuti. Since dry coconut is n=\r\not available now, can I do purnahuti with a big stream of spoonful ghee? Lo=\r\ngically it might be acceptable, since I am offering only ghee as ahuti, so =\r\nwhy not a big amount of ghee as purna (full) ahuti? Also I read in the arch=\r\nieve that in deepa-homam, purnahuti can be done with ghee.\n\nKindly confirm.=\r\n\n\nThanks\nTanvir\n\n\n"}}
