I am doing it without reveali=\r\nng your identity.=A0*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0&gt; if =\r\nhe didnt go to the queen for mere enjoyment of sex ,if he didnt indulge him=\r\nself&gt; mindfully in the deed?&enjoy it,he went only for a reason he is not t=\r\nhe karman,atma&gt; cannot be polluted,realising this sankara went to the queen=\r\n&thus he is still as sacred&gt; as ever?=A0Though correct, this is a dangerous=\r\n notion for most people. True, atma cannot be poluted and is beyond desires=\r\n and actions. But most people do not identify with atma. They identify with=\r\n a perishable body. So all the talk of &quot;all is atma and atma is pure&quot; is ju=\r\nst theory.=A0Atma is like an ocean in which waves and rippes arise and move=\r\n. Ocean does not get shattered when ripples hit each other and stays the sa=\r\nme. But bodies, minds and\n other perishable objects arising in atma are lik=\r\ne waves and ripples arising and moving in ocean. They increase, decrease, g=\r\net shattered etc. One identifying with the ocean of atma is beyond happines=\r\ns and sadness. One identifying with the ripple of a body will experience ha=\r\nppiness, sadness etc.=A0Suppose one is watching a movie and knows that it i=\r\ns not real and just a movie. Still, when a really scary scene comes, one ma=\r\ny be startled. Mere intellectual understanding that it is not real and just=\r\n a movie, is not enough. It has to be ingrained fully in one&#39;s instincts. S=\r\nimilarly, intellectually knowing that all this is a play and not real, is n=\r\not enough. When some really pleasurable and painful event happens, one WILL=\r\n identify with the body and experience something.=A0If Shankara was fully e=\r\nnlightened before that episode (we don&#39;t know that for sure), then the acti=\r\non would not have bound him. Otherwise, it would&#39;ve created a rina. If he e=\r\nxperienced some\n pleasure, he would create a new rina to the queen, to vari=\r\nous deities (!) who live within one&#39;s consciousness and operate various par=\r\nts of one&#39;s body and mind, and to various beings in his virya who may have =\r\nbeen significantly affected. He would have to pay those debts back later.=\r\n=A0*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0There is nothing absol=\r\nutely sacred or dirty about any action. It is the intent and attitude of th=\r\ne actor that makes an action sacred or dirty. Self-centered actions are mor=\r\ne dirty than selfless actions geared at others. More so, the denser and mor=\r\ne selfish one&#39;s conditioning. =A0*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0&gt; but knowing this still he performed his rituals for his mother?di=\r\nd he do&gt; this for love or respect or pity or just to balance his runa?=A0On=\r\nly still ocean does not have any ripples or their movement. Similarly only =\r\nummanifest atma (Self after dissolution/pralaya and before new srishti/crea=\r\ntion) does not have any objects and actions\n within it. Atma during a srish=\r\nti cycle does have many objects within it and many actions between them.=A0=\r\nThus, realizing Self does NOT mean sitting still in a forest and doing noth=\r\ning. Various bodies keep doing various actions. A realized person identifie=\r\ns with atma and actions by various people seem to him/her like his/her acti=\r\nons. One does not particularly identify with what one&#39;s old body specifical=\r\nly does (based on previous momentum).=A0Nature uses such realized people to=\r\n set good examples for the world. So they do engage in some actions. They h=\r\nave no pride or shame, no happiness or sadness and do whatever spontaneousl=\r\ny occurs to them.=A0Shankara performing last rites for mother would&#39;ve made=\r\n Mother happy. Moreover, it would set an example for future. One&#39;s interact=\r\nion with the world is give & take. We give things to others and take things=\r\n from them. True renunciation is in renouncing what we take. There is no ne=\r\ned to renounce giving. As the prevant\n notion of sannyasa was to cut off fr=\r\nom the world, Shankara demonstrated giving others (e.g. mother) sannyasa.=\r\n=A0Swami Vivekananda and Swami Sivananda took this further. They engaged in=\r\n a lot of service for the society, unlike other sannyasis who lock themselv=\r\nes in isolation.=A0Of course, if the act of &quot;giving&quot; increases pride (i.e. =\r\nyou are &quot;taking&quot; something in return of what you are giving!!!), then a san=\r\nnyasi better isolate oneself from the world and neither give nor take (exce=\r\npt absolute essentials for survival). But, when one progresses beyond some =\r\nlevel, it is a good idea to &quot;give&quot; what one is in a position to give others=\r\n.=A0The purpose of life is to give and not to take, though some taking is u=\r\nnavoidable in the process of giving. Focus on what you give and not on what=\r\n you take.=A0*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0&gt; can one a=\r\nchieve moksha still in family life=A0Yes.=A0You are still not old enough. F=\r\nocus on your studies for the next 3-4 years. But,\n eventually, you can read=\r\n &quot;Yoga Vasishtham&quot;.=A0*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 * =A0&gt; =\r\nstill iam in silly thoughts....ya can man controll his thoughts100%?]=A0Var=\r\nious good and bad thoughts come to mind continuously, for it is the nature =\r\nof mind! As long as one is alive, the force that runs one&#39;s existence creat=\r\nes thoughts in the mind. This force is based on the momentum from various n=\r\notions one was exposed to and various desires one entertained, during vario=\r\nus lives. It is called &quot;mental conditioning&quot;.=A0Can it be controlled? Yes, =\r\nin the sense that one can add new notions and new desires to this driving f=\r\norce and the its direction can be slowly refined over time.=A0Mind is the p=\r\nroblem and mind is the key to the solution as well. Use mind to change the =\r\ndirection of mind.=A0I don&#39;t know about 100%, but I do not know one can mod=\r\nify one&#39;s thinking over time.=A0Best regards,Narasimha--------Astrology & S=\r\npirituality Resources:\n http://www.VedicAstrologer.org=A0&lt;deleted&gt;,if atma =\r\nis in us and atma is the part of akhanda jyoti swaroop[the god-all in one f=\r\nire form] and the man knew that pleasure of the realization like sankara di=\r\nd....if he didnt go to the queen for mere enjoyment of sex ,if he didnt ind=\r\nulge himself mindfully in the deed?&enjoy it,he went only for a reason he i=\r\ns not the karman,atma cannot be polluted,realising this sankara went to the=\r\n queen&thus he is still as sacred as ever?but knowing this still he perform=\r\ned his rituals for his mother?did he do this for love or respect or pity or=\r\n just to balance his runa?i have read&#39;&#39;ruaanubandha ruupena pasu patni suta=\r\nalayah&quot;did he want to balance his runa?or..but still he is a sarvasanghapar=\r\nityagi...why may he have done it?what may he be telling us through this dee=\r\nd?&lt;deleted&gt;[&lt;deleted&gt;

I am doing it without revealing your identit=\r\ny.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;&gt; if he didnt go to the =\r\nqueen for mere enjoyment of sex ,if he didnt indulge himself&lt;wbr&gt;&gt; mindf=\r\nully in the deed?&amp;enjoy it,he went only for a reason he is not the karm=\r\nan,atma&lt;wbr&gt;&gt; cannot be polluted,realising this sankara went to the quee=\r\nn&amp;thus he is still as sacred&lt;wbr&gt;&gt; as ever?&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Though co=\r\nrrect, this is a dangerous notion for most people. True, atma cannot be pol=\r\nuted and is beyond desires and actions. But most\n people do not identify wi=\r\nth atma. They\n identify with a perishable body. So all the talk of &quot;all is =\r\natma and atma is pure&quot; is just theory.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Atma is like an ocean=\r\n in which waves and rippes arise and move. Ocean does not get shattered whe=\r\nn ripples hit each other and stays the same. But bodies, minds and other pe=\r\nrishable objects arising in atma are like waves and ripples arising and mov=\r\ning in ocean. They increase, decrease, get shattered etc. One identifying w=\r\nith the ocean of atma is beyond happiness and sadness. One identifying with=\r\n the ripple of a body will experience happiness, sadness etc.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wb=\r\nr&gt;Suppose one is watching a movie and knows that it is not real and just a =\r\nmovie. Still, when a really scary scene comes, one may be startled. Mere in=\r\ntellectual understanding that it is not real and just a movie, is not enoug=\r\nh. It has to be ingrained fully in one&#39;s instincts. Similarly, intellectual=\r\nly knowing that all this is a play and not real, is not enough. When some r=\r\neally\n pleasurable and painful event happens, one WILL identify with the bo=\r\ndy and experience something.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;If Shankara was fully enlighten=\r\ned before that episode (we don&#39;t know that for sure), then the action would=\r\n not have bound him. Otherwise, it would&#39;ve created a rina. If he experienc=\r\ned some pleasure, he would create a new rina to the queen, to various deiti=\r\nes (!) who live within one&#39;s consciousness and operate various parts of one=\r\n&#39;s body and mind, and to various beings in his virya who may have been sign=\r\nificantly affected. He would have to pay those debts back later.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;wbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;There is nothing absolutely sacred or di=\r\nrty about any action. It is the intent and attitude of the actor that makes=\r\n an action sacred or dirty. Self-centered actions are more dirty than selfl=\r\ness actions geared at others. More so, the denser and more selfish one&#39;s\n c=\r\nonditioning. &lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&=\r\nnbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;&gt; but knowing=\r\n this still he performed his rituals for his mother?did he do&lt;wbr&gt;&gt; this=\r\n for love or respect or pity or just to balance his runa?&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;On=\r\nly still ocean does not have any ripples or their movement. Similarly only =\r\nummanifest atma (Self after dissolution/pralaya and before new srishti/crea=\r\ntion) does not have any objects and actions within it. Atma during a srisht=\r\ni cycle does have many objects within it and many actions between them.&lt;wbr=\r\n&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Thus, realizing Self does NOT mean sitting still in a forest an=\r\nd doing nothing. Various bodies keep doing various actions. A realized pers=\r\non identifies with atma and actions by various people seem to him/her like =\r\nhis/her actions. One does not particularly identify with what one&#39;s old bod=\r\ny specifically does (based on previous\n momentum).&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Nature us=\r\nes\n such realized people to set good examples for the world. So they do eng=\r\nage in some actions. They have no pride or shame, no happiness or sadness a=\r\nnd do whatever spontaneously occurs to them.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Shankara perfor=\r\nming last rites for mother would&#39;ve made Mother happy. Moreover, it would s=\r\net an example for future. One&#39;s interaction with the world is give &amp; ta=\r\nke. We give things to others and take things from them. True renunciation i=\r\ns in renouncing what we take. There is no need to renounce giving. As the p=\r\nrevant notion of sannyasa was to cut off from the world, Shankara demonstra=\r\nted giving others (e.g. mother) sannyasa.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Swami Vivekananda =\r\nand Swami Sivananda took this further. They engaged in a lot of service for=\r\n the society, unlike other sannyasis who lock themselves in isolation.&lt;wbr&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Of course, if the act of &quot;giving&quot; increases pride (i.e. you are =\r\n&quot;taking&quot; something in return of what you are giving!!!), then a sannyasi\n b=\r\netter isolate oneself from the world and neither give nor take (except abso=\r\nlute essentials for survival). But, when one progresses beyond some level, =\r\nit is a good idea to &quot;give&quot; what one is in a position to give others.&lt;wbr&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;The purpose of life is to give and not to take, though some takin=\r\ng is unavoidable in the process of giving. Focus on what you give and not o=\r\nn what you take.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; * &lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;&gt; can one=\r\n achieve moksha still in family life&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Yes.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;You=\r\n are still not old enough. Focus on your studies for the next 3-4 years. Bu=\r\nt, eventually, you can read &quot;Yoga Vasishtham&quot;.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;=\r\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; =\r\n* &lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;&gt; still iam in silly thoughts....ya can man controll h=\r\nis thoughts100%?]&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Various good and bad thoughts\n come to min=\r\nd\n continuously, for it is the nature of mind! As long as one is alive, the=\r\n force that runs one&#39;s existence creates thoughts in the mind. This force i=\r\ns based on the momentum from various notions one was exposed to and various=\r\n desires one entertained, during various lives. It is called &quot;mental condit=\r\nioning&quot;.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Can it be controlled? Yes, in the sense that one ca=\r\nn add new notions and new desires to this driving force and the its directi=\r\non can be slowly refined over time.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Mind is the problem and =\r\nmind is the key to the solution as well. Use mind to change the direction o=\r\nf mind.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;I don&#39;t know about 100%, but I do not know one can m=\r\nodify one&#39;s thinking over time.&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;Best regards,&lt;wbr&gt;Narasimha&lt;=\r\nwbr&gt;--------&lt;wbr&gt;Astrology &amp; Spirituality Resources: http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org&lt;wbr&gt;&nbsp;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;,&lt;wbr&gt;if atma is in us and atma =\r\nis the part of akhanda jyoti swaroop[the god-all in one fire form] and\n the=\r\n man knew\n that pleasure of the realization like sankara did....&lt;wbr&gt;if he =\r\ndidnt go to the queen for mere enjoyment of sex ,if he didnt indulge himsel=\r\nf mindfully in the deed?&amp;enjoy it,he went only for a reason he is not t=\r\nhe karman,atma cannot be polluted,realising this sankara went to the queen&=\r\namp;thus he is still as sacred as ever?&lt;wbr&gt;but knowing this still he perfo=\r\nrmed his rituals for his mother?did he do this for love or respect or pity =\r\nor just to balance his runa?&lt;wbr&gt;i have read&#39;&#39;ruaanubandha ruupena pasu pat=\r\nni sutaalayah&quot;did he want to balance his runa?or..but still he is a sarvasa=\r\nnghaparityagi...why may he have done it?what may he be telling us through t=\r\nhis deed?&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;[&lt;deleted&gt; can one achieve moksha s=\r\ntill in family life if he really realises atman if the above assumption is =\r\ntrue..then how can one realise atman?is it a feeling or a substratum?what i=\r\ns it made upof?&lt;wbr&gt;still iam in silly thoughts....ya can man controll his\n=\r\n thoughts100%?]&lt;wbr&gt;iam extremely sorry...but...i couldnt resist asking you=\r\n for &lt;deleted&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;really sorry for bothering...&lt;wbr&gt;namaskaram....&lt;w=\r\nbr&gt;good night...&lt;wbr&gt;-- &lt;wbr&gt;&lt;deleted&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n    &lt;/div&gt;\n  =\r\n   \n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tbody&gt;&lt;/table=\r\n&gt;\n\n\n\n\n\n&lt;wbr&gt;\n\n    \n    \n&lt;wbr&gt;\n\n\n\n\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: white; clear: both;&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;/div&gt;\n\n\n&lt;/div&gt;&lt;wbr&gt;&lt;wbr&gt; &lt;/div&gt; &lt;/div&gt;  &lt;/div&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--1886287700-293706539-1338291489=:83564--\r\n\n"}}
