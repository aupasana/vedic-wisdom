And I have been reading the posts on this forum with much awe and intere=\r\nst. \n\nOn the 28th of Jan, my father passed away peacefully (after strugglin=\r\ng with renal failure and other complications) at our home in Hyderabad. Whe=\r\nn we were taking my father&#39;s body to the smashaan bhoomi for final rites, m=\r\ny mind was constantly reminded of the brilliant notes(Ram naam satya hai - =\r\n1/2/3) written by Rajarshi (detailing his experience of doing a Chandi Homa=\r\nm on a funeral pyre in Kashi with Manish-ji), and I started wondering if I =\r\nwould get to see some Aghoris in the smashaan bhumi at Hyd. I thought how w=\r\nonderful it would be, if an Aghori performs a homam on my dad&#39;s funeral - s=\r\no that he would also attain some punya (as per the note). And then immediat=\r\nely, I had an intense desire to perform a similar homam by myself, but I qu=\r\nickly reminded myself that I must be kidding to even think that I can do su=\r\nch a feat. As we descended the steps of the smashaan bhumi, I started exper=\r\niencing intensely subtle sensations all over my body...especially in/around=\r\n the abdominal region. As taught in Vipassana, I &#39;watched&#39; the sensations a=\r\ns equanimously as I could, and told myself that &#39;even this would change&#39;. S=\r\noon after, a thought came to my mind, that it is all at the level of the mi=\r\nnd, and may be I should perform a mini version of Chandi Homam in my mental=\r\n imagery. But I still wanted to have a tangible element to it, so I asked a=\r\n friend, if he could procure some black sesame seeds and jaggery (now when =\r\nI think of it, this friend was not even baffled at my request) - and he wen=\r\nt away saying he would try and returned back in 10 minutes with the above 2=\r\n things and in addition he bought some ghee. \n\nIt was my first time at a sm=\r\nashaan bhumi, and also the very first time that I had seen death/dead body =\r\nat such close quarters. It was a very &#39;delicate&#39; situation for me, but soon=\r\n after the fire was ignited (by my eldest brother - exactly at sunset time)=\r\n, I composed myself, went in the direction opposite to where all the friend=\r\ns/relatives were standing and sat down on a stone platform in sukhaasana. I=\r\n asked my cousin and my nephew to sit on either side, told them that I woul=\r\nd like to meditate, and requested them to let me know if &#39;something&#39; happen=\r\ns. I had already observed a brown colored dog (thanks to the vivid descript=\r\nion in Rajarshi&#39;s notes) as we reached the funeral-pyre platform, so I thin=\r\nk, I was expecting the dog to behave a little differently (silly me!!):). \n=\r\n\nI closed my eyes - thanked Mother Earth, my parents, my grandparents, the =\r\nGods and the Rishis; and seeked their support and blessings in my very firs=\r\nt attempt in doing such a ritual. Being a Vipassana meditator, I am used to=\r\n focussing on breath, and I saw my breathing was a little fast. I continued=\r\n watching my breath for few minutes and soon, I was centred enough. I remem=\r\nbered the warning that this should be done ONLY and ONLY with the purest in=\r\ntention of gaining spiritual progress; so I inspected my mind and found the=\r\n truth to be different. I had a deep desire that my father accumulates some=\r\n &#39;punya&#39; so that his journey in the non-physical plane is &#39;mangalmayee&#39;. I =\r\ninspected further and felt that there was some thrill/excitement too in my =\r\nmind about attempting such a unconventional thing. I did not want to give-u=\r\np, so I mentally surrendered myself and said &quot;this is the truth Maa, I am n=\r\not a true seeker, I have mundane desires. Everytime I have done homam in th=\r\ne past, I have asked you to purify my mind, because I have believed and sti=\r\nll believe that it won&#39;t be good to ask for purification/nullification of m=\r\ny past karmas, if I continue generating new ones at the same speed. Today a=\r\ns well, I ask you to purify my impure mind. The impure mind that I have, ha=\r\ns this mundane desire that his father attains some punya and his journey ah=\r\nead is peaceful. I am sincere, when I tell this to you Maa, so please accep=\r\nt my impurities and my ignorance and let me do this homam. Please pardon th=\r\nis son of yours if he is doing something wrong&quot;. \n\nAfter this mental dialog=\r\nue, I though of invoking Durga on the funeral pyre (even though I thought a=\r\nbout Maa Kali/Smashan Kali etc etc) purely because the ONLY Devi mantra tha=\r\nt I am a little comfortable with is a Durga Mantra. In my mind, I said, ALL=\r\n are forms of one and the same DeviShakti, and it should not really matter,=\r\n which Devi form I invoke. But then I could not just visualise Maa Durga an=\r\nd instead saw a cloud-like pattern, purple in colour, and fully occupying m=\r\ny mental imagery. I thought of my father - and was trying to co-relate that=\r\n with the colour of gangrene which had developed in his feet, but the purpl=\r\ne was different, and immediately a thought sprung in my mind associating th=\r\nat colour with the colour of Maa Chandi who wears &#39;skeletal jewellery&#39; (NOT=\r\n trying to be funny) and I said, aah..okay..so this is the form of Maa whic=\r\nh has arrived. I did mental Namaskar to Maa Chandi, repeated mentally the t=\r\nhoughts about the desire and surrendering of my ignorance. I sought permiss=\r\nion from the deity to use a Durga mantra by explaning the context. I also r=\r\nemember clearly, that I was a little scared too, and I told Maa to be kind,=\r\n and to NOT give me any results if she didnt deem me to be fit, but to defi=\r\nnetely NOT punish me in any way for doing this.\n\nI had a small mental dialo=\r\ngue with my father, wherein I briefed him about what I was going to do, and=\r\n I seeked his permission, forgiveness and blessings. \n\nAnd then I started m=\r\ny mantra chanting (with swaha) - and tried visualising that I was offering =\r\nsomething in the pyre. I could not actually visualise any offerings taking =\r\nplace - but I still continued with the swaha at the end of the mantra for a=\r\n while, and then switched to a mantra-japam without the swaha at the end. T=\r\nhrough out I was fully aware of the visualisation of Maa Chandi standing on=\r\n my dad&#39;s funeral. Sometimes, I would visualise her lifting her feet altern=\r\natively, as if she was crushing something. A few minutes later, I felt the =\r\nDevi removed a feet or a wooden log - and threw it at a little distance in =\r\nthe direction which was opposite to mine. I think about five/ten minutes la=\r\nter, I became a little curious and wanted to see if the dog had come and wa=\r\ns sitting somewhere around. I opened my eyes, and did NOT find the dog. I w=\r\nas not disappointed, but I told myself, it was silly of me to think I would=\r\n be able to invite the deity, but nevertheless I continued. Few minutes lat=\r\ner, I heard some sound of wings fluttering and opened my eyes to see a shin=\r\ning black hen (I think it was a rooster, as it had a small, but bright red =\r\nhood/crown). It had come from the piece of land next to the smashaan bhumi =\r\n(either a graveyard or a temple - am not sure) after descending from a 6ft =\r\nboundary wall. It came close to the burning funeral and started jumping and=\r\n moving around the funeral. It seemed as if the hen wanted to jump inside t=\r\nhe funeral and die. Another second it felt, perhaps the hen was acting stra=\r\nnge because it was amused with the fire particles (which looked like &#39;jugnu=\r\ns&#39;) falling down on the earth, as a result of the funeral fire hitting the =\r\ncement roof of the funeral platform. I watched the bird for few minutes, la=\r\nughed at myself, thinking a black hen came instead of a dog, but neverthele=\r\nss I said I would continue until it is time for us to leave. I asked my cou=\r\nsin and he said 30 more minutes. So I continued the mental chanting. \n\nAnd =\r\nthen my cousin signalled me that it was time for everyone to leave. I waite=\r\nd for everyone to start walking towards the exit, mixed the black sesame se=\r\neds, jaggery and ghee in the plastic packet itself, and walked towards the =\r\nfuneral. I seeked forgivess from Maa for my impudence and asked her to acce=\r\npt my offerings. I had offered only three times, and it was sooooo hot that=\r\n I could not stand closer and started wondering how far did Manish and Raja=\r\nrshi sit to offer the samagri into the fire? Another cousin of mine, shoute=\r\nd my name from behind, and asked me to hurry up and join them, and even tho=\r\nugh it was dark and he would not have seen exactly what was happening, I wa=\r\ns a little scared because I did not want anyone to know that I had &#39;Aghori&#39;=\r\n tendencies, I quickly stepped back, emptied the contents of the packets in=\r\n both my hands, apologised to the Devi again for my impudence and requested=\r\n her to accept this final offering and threw it at the funeral pyre from a =\r\ndistance. I thanked her once again and requested her to simply do the needf=\r\nul and then thanked everyone (including the yahoo group and Rajashri/Manish=\r\n/PVR) and quickly walked and joined the group. \n\nWhen I was washing my hand=\r\ns and feet at the well, I looked at the funeral and now there was a red tin=\r\nge to the fire, which was not there before (could be because of black sesam=\r\ne seeds or jaggery??). \n\nOn the way back home and for the entire evening, I=\r\n felt very very very quiet within. I would&#39;nt say that I felt a sense of ac=\r\nhievement, because the thought of what happened was not strong in my mind. =\r\nI had neither forgotten, nor was I thinking about &#39;it&#39;. There was a certian=\r\n stillness within my existence that evening. I watched my breath as much as=\r\n I could. No judgement, no questions, just a sense of &#39;wonder&#39;. The visuali=\r\nsations could have been a product of my own imagination - but the silence w=\r\nas real. And this experience of silence was the most beautiful thing. \n\nThe=\r\n next day, I heard my brother tell my uncle that he had witnessed many fire=\r\ns, but the one yesterday seemed too big and somewhat special. I wondered if=\r\n my brother was speaking out of &#39;perception&#39; or love for our father.\n\nNow t=\r\nhat it is few days since that incident, I have questions like - is the hen =\r\ntoo, as sensitive as a dog is? Why was it jumping &#39;madly&#39; around the fire? =\r\nIs there a connection between the hen and the fact that in Hyd, people perf=\r\norm hen-sacrifice at Shakti/Maa temples? Did Shakti really grant some &#39;puny=\r\na&#39; to my dad? If it did, then why did I visualise my dad crawl and climb (a=\r\ns opposed to climbing on two feet) a half-constructed building the next day=\r\n when I was channeling some reiki to him? \n\nI am not sure if these question=\r\ns can be answered or if they should be answered at all, but based on the ab=\r\nove experience, if anyone has any input/lessons/guidance/teachings, I would=\r\n be most appreciative.\n\nThank you PVR/Manish and Rajarshi for the continued=\r\n inspiration. \n\nAlso, apologies for the length of the note.\n\n\nRegards\nShara=\r\nd\n\n\n"}}
