They\nonly =\r\ncontinue their DurgaMaa/Chandi worship which they have always\nfelt naturall=\r\ny inclined to. \n\nWhat is the significance of this and what can one do when =\r\nIshta Devata\nis also the Badhakesh?\n\nThank you for taking the time to read =\r\nmy post.\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr=\r\n@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; First of all, our current understanding of a=\r\nrriving at ishta devata\nfrom \n&gt; horoscope is not perfect.\n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly, th=\r\ne way ishta devata may work is complex. The role of\nishta devata \n&gt; is to g=\r\nive moksha. Moksha is the state of non-distinction between\nobjects of \n&gt; un=\r\niverse. &quot;Supreme cosmic being&quot; (known by various names) is the\nobserver of =\r\n\n&gt; all with non-distinction and the gate to moksha. Several deities play \n&gt;=\r\n specific roles in the universe at the lower level and become one with \n&gt; s=\r\nupreme cosmic being at a higher level. Accordingly, one may start\npraying \n=\r\n&gt; to a specific form of a deity with a specific role in the universe,\nlater=\r\n \n&gt; realize a higher form of the deity and then become liberated through\nth=\r\nat \n&gt; higher form.\n&gt; \n&gt; For this reason, some (especially some gurus at Sri=\r\n Jagannath\nCentre) even \n&gt; say that only Vishnu&#39;s incarnations can be ishta=\r\n devatas giving\nmoksha and \n&gt; other deities cannot be. This is partly logic=\r\nal, but based on a \n&gt; misconception. Vishnu here refers to sarva vyaapakesw=\r\nara (all-pervading \n&gt; lord). If one realizes an all-pervading form of Ganes=\r\nha or Surya or\nLakshmi \n&gt; or Kaali or Shiva or Subrahmanya, then too that f=\r\norm qualifies as ishta \n&gt; devata who enables moksha (liberation). For examp=\r\nle, Ganapathi Atharva \n&gt; Seersham describes a supreme cosmic being form of =\r\nGanapathi, from whom \n&gt; Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva come. Suryopanishat descri=\r\nbes a supreme cosmic \n&gt; being form of Surya, from whom Brahma, Vishn and Sh=\r\niva come. And so on.\n&gt; \n&gt; One may start with the worship of Ganesha who rem=\r\noves obstacles and\nfinally \n&gt; realize a form of Ganesha that is beyond guna=\r\ns and from whom Brahma,\nVishnu, \n&gt; Shiva, Surya, Agni, Vaayu etc are born. =\r\nOne may start with the\nworship of \n&gt; Lakshmi who gives prosperity and money=\r\n and finally realize a form of\nLakshmi \n&gt; who drives the thoughts and actio=\r\nns of all beings. One may start\nwith the \n&gt; worship of Saraswati who gives =\r\nknowledge and finally realize a form of \n&gt; Saraswati who is the root of all=\r\n creation.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, one starts worshipping one&#39;s ishta devata and slowly =\r\nevolves to \n&gt; worshipping a higher all-pervading form of that deity, who ma=\r\ny\nsometimes \n&gt; seem like a different deity to a casual observer. This is th=\r\ne natural \n&gt; process of evolution.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Saptashati=\r\n rahasya associated with saptashati (Chandipath) describes\nthe \n&gt; process o=\r\nf creation. It says that first there was Mahalakshmi with\nthree \n&gt; gunas. S=\r\nhe divided herself into 3 parts - Mahakali with tamas (ichchhaa \n&gt; sakti - =\r\nthe force behind desire), Mahalakshmi with sattwa (jnaana\nsakti - \n&gt; the fo=\r\nrce behind knowledge) and Mahasaraswati (kriyaa sakti - the force \n&gt; behind=\r\n action) with rajas. The 3 parts of Chandipath are devoted to the \n&gt; three.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, trigunatmika Mahalakshmi is the root energy driving the \n&gt; desi=\r\nres/thoughts, knowledge/perception and actions of all beings in\nthis \n&gt; uni=\r\nverse.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, chapter 11 towards the end of Chandipath prays to Devi=\r\n (divine \n&gt; Mother) after all her exploits and addresses Her in the prayer =\r\nas \n&gt; &quot;Naaraayani&quot; (energy of Narayana). If one views Naaraayana as\nsupreme=\r\n cosmic \n&gt; being from whom Brahma, Vishnu and Shiva came, trigunatmika\nMaha=\r\nlakshami (or \n&gt; Narayani) is his energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; Thus, the Divine Mother of Ch=\r\nandipath is not really different from \n&gt; Mahalakshmi I have been worshippin=\r\ng for many years. I originally\nstarted out \n&gt; worshipping Lakshmi with 4 ha=\r\nnds who sita on a lotus and gives money. I \n&gt; later realized that a higher =\r\nform of the same deity is the energy of \n&gt; Narayana (supreme cosmic being) =\r\nand She is responsible for the birth, \n&gt; sustenance and destruction of all =\r\nbeings including Brahma, Vishnu\nand Shiva.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Wh=\r\nichever deity you are attached to and worship as your ishta\ndevata, please =\r\n\n&gt; try to imagine that deity as the all-pervading supreme cosmic being\nfrom=\r\n \n&gt; whom the entire creation evolves.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ----=\r\n--------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short=\r\n Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Y=\r\nourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://grou=\r\nps.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedica=\r\nstro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAs=\r\ntrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.=\r\norg\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------ \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; T=\r\no: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Thursday, January 15, 2009 11:44 =\r\nPM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Question on Istha devata to Narasimhaji\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Namaste Narasimhaji\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I was reading up on the old mail about how you=\r\nr started doign Chandi\n&gt; &gt; Homa.
