But still he\nsits on ground saying that &quot;mandir is closed, but ma=\r\nta is present in\nsorrounding, so no problem..and he sits on ground.&quot;.\n\nTher=\r\ne he is approached by a Senoir Pujari--he feels a feeling of\nGURU-bhakti=A0=\r\n for the pujari.\nHe wanted to talk/discuss to GURU ji=A0 Re:diksha matter..=\r\n\nBut The Guru ji did not gave chance to speak and asked him to Come Close.\n=\r\n\nIn Dream he feel that this GURU ji already knows Everything about his\nCuri=\r\nosity and his Icchha.\n\nGuru asks him about Importance of Cow Dung...Gobar. =\r\nhe replies\nsatisfactory about importance of gobar from vedic point of view\n=\r\netc.etc. here....some discussions.....\n\nthen Guru ji asks him to put Gobar =\r\non his own head (friend).\nhe does. he takes around a Kilo and Covers Whole =\r\nHead.\n\nThen GURU ji Keeps Talking about other puja matter...while Doing som=\r\ne\nFormalities.\nGuru ji=A0 also says that in Garbh-Grih only He with his=A0 =\r\nSome selected\ndikhit -Sishya do puja..other people not allowed.\nMy friend s=\r\nays that, &quot;He Knows He has heard/read about this&quot;.\n\nMy Friend in dreams Str=\r\nongly Feels That he is getting Diksha. (Guru ji\nis Giving Diksha).\n(as guru=\r\n ji doing some mantra jaap....touching his head several times)\n\nAfter this =\r\nGuru ji Instructs his one disciple to bring the Mata\nBagalamukhi Idol from =\r\nGarbh-Grih and let the Friend do Darshan. which\nhe did..\n\nAfter that guru j=\r\ni tells him,=A0 &quot;have you decided your Diksha Name&quot;\nMy friend tells No, &quot;bu=\r\nt i will be happy whatever name you decide for me&quot;.\n\nGuru tell him,&quot;from to=\r\nday your name will be Dityanand&quot;.\nmy friend touches the Guru Ji feet. Guru =\r\nji blessed him...\n\nand dream breaks.......\n\nMy friend feels very happy on w=\r\naking up ....very energetic.....\nHe notes down=A0 some important point of d=\r\nream.(so he does not forget later)\n\nHe Notes:\nTime- 04:20 am,=A0 Wednesday =\r\nMorning.\nDay- Shivaratri Day,\nDate-2nd -March-2011, Early Morning.\nKrishna =\r\nPachh-Trayodashi Thithi.\n\nHe remembers that: The guru ji did not tell any p=\r\narticular mantra to him.\nSo he assumes that probably the puja vidhi and man=\r\ntra=A0 is ok. whatever he does.\n\nThe Guru ji in Dreams was a Thin person in=\r\n the age of 60-70, with some\nsmall=A0 white beards.\nThe place in dreams he =\r\nfeels about Datia.\n\nyour comments will be highly appreciated.....\n\nthanks\nv=\r\niky\n\n\n\n\n"}}
