They have d=\r\none a bunch of research\ncomparing and contrasting the Tolkappiyam & Paniniy=\r\nam grammar. I do\nnot know anything about this, but it is certainly an inter=\r\nesting area\nof study.\n\n&gt; Dedicated to the Adi sha~gkara ... with is comment=\r\n on vyAkarNa\n&gt; his &quot;ai giri...&quot; cannot be understand if you don&#39;t know what=\r\n &quot;ai&quot; is\n\nFirstly, on this tangent -- to be best of my knowledge, the\nmahis=\r\nhAsura-mardini stotram is not a composition of Adi shankara. I do\nnot see i=\r\nt in the Vani Vilas edition of his woks. It is possible that\nthe composer w=\r\nas someone named Ramakrishna Kavi.\n\nSecondly, on point. In my opinion, Adi =\r\nshankara made no comment\ntowards you, or towards any vaiyAkaraNa regarding =\r\nvyAkaraNa. A little\nbit of logic shows a lot of myth surrounding his moha-m=\r\nudgara-stotra\n(later rebranded as bhaja-govinda). The rumour-mill account, =\r\nwhich is\ntaken as the absolute truth says that Adi shankara saw an old man\n=\r\ntrying to start learning grammar by memorizing the dhAtu-pAtha, and\nout of =\r\npity, he instructed him by spontaneously composing 12 verses.\nThe remaining=\r\n verses are said to be later additions.\n\n(a) It is difficult to justify the=\r\n composition of the 2nd verse\n(muuDha jahiihi) and especially difficult to =\r\njustify the composition\nof the 3rd verse (nArii-stana) as an upadesha to an=\r\n old man. If we\nassume that aspects of the traditional account are true, it=\r\n is much\nmore likely that he recited these verses to his own sannyAsii stud=\r\nents\nto cultivate vairAgya in them. Assuming that you are a non-sannyAsii,\n=\r\nthere&#39;s no reason to get riled up about advice that is not primarily\ndirect=\r\ned at you.\n\n(b) Adi shankara is said to have composed the first 12 stanzas,=\r\n\nfollowing which, many of his students composed single verses that have\nbee=\r\nn now been compiled together. It is pretty unlikely that Adi\nshankara would=\r\n have had his disciples (young and old) gang up on an\nold man. It also seem=\r\ns unlikely that his students would have added\nonto a work that was composed=\r\n for someone else&#39;s benefit. In a\nsatsanga of rishis, everyone waits for th=\r\ne main rishi to speak. On the\nother hand, assume that this advice was compo=\r\nsed and imparted to his\nown students. It is more likely that his students m=\r\night add onto this\nkind of work. Again, there is no reason for you to get r=\r\niled up about\nadvice that is not primarily directed at you.\n\n(c) In the bes=\r\nt case, the first verse (bhaja govindam) merely provides\nthe context. At wo=\r\nrst, it is a later addition. The moha-mudgara\nconsists of verses 1-12. Let =\r\nus take the first verse as a\nmangala-shloka, rather than excluding it altog=\r\nether. This stotram is a\nwork of contemplation. Though Adi shankara is a ma=\r\nster bhakta, this\nwork is not a good example of bhakti. The older name of t=\r\nhe stotram\n(moha mudgara =3D hammering delusion), is much more reflective o=\r\nf the\nwork that the popular name (bhaja govindam). Across his works, Adi\nsh=\r\nankara is clear about people needing different solutions at\ndifferent point=\r\ns in their spiritual life. First, they need karma +\nupAsana, and only later=\r\n should they pursue viveka. Thus, the advice in\nhis stotra is intended prim=\r\narily for a different crowd. It is unlikely\nthat he would have given this a=\r\ndvice to some random stranger. There is\nno reason for you to get riled up a=\r\nbout advice that is not primarily\ndirected at you.\n\n(d) Now, let us assume =\r\nthat the rumour-mill account is true. As you\nhave noted, Adi shankara&#39;s com=\r\npositions are composed in sanskrit.\nFurther, it is clear that he is extreme=\r\nly well-versed in grammar. So,\nany conclusion that he is anti-grammar seems=\r\n strange, and is wrong.\nThere is no reason to get riled up over this.\n\n(e) =\r\nHis sampradAya safeguards grammar. Just as one example, vyAkaraNa\nis a regu=\r\nlar topic of discourse in the yearly vAkyArtha-sabhA at\nsringeri. It is the=\r\n same institution that is publishing, and\nre-publishing various grammatical=\r\n works. His own disciples, who adorn\nthis peeTha, are great scholars of vyA=\r\nkaraNa. Adi shankara, and his\nsampradAya are clearly not anti-grammar. In f=\r\nact, they are clearly\npro-grammar. So, there is nothing to get riled up abo=\r\nut.\n\nNow, let us take the &quot;bhaja govindam&quot; verse at face value. I still\ndon=\r\n&#39;t see the problem --\n\nThat there is no point in studying the dhAtu-pATha o=\r\nn the death-bed.\nThis makes sense. &quot;dvAdasha-varShaiH shruuyate vyAkaraNam&quot;=\r\n. Grammar is\nlearned in 12 years. What point is there in starting the study=\r\n on the\ndeath-bed? This doesn&#39;t mean that vyAkaraNam shouldn&#39;t be studied a=\r\nt\nall. All it means is that desha-kAla-pAtra should be taken into\naccount. =\r\nAnd, if you want to take things literally, Adi shankara said\nnothing about =\r\ngrammar in general. In this verse, all he talked about\nwas the dhAtu-pATha =\r\nin particular.\n\nPeople who truly study the dhAtu pATha these days are rare,=\r\n and I\nwould expect a disproportionate number of them to consider Adi\nshank=\r\nara as their guru.\n\nbhavadiiyaH,\n\n=A0 =A0ajit\n\n"}}
