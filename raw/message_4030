There is nothing wrong digging in many p=\r\nlaces.\n\nAlso we live in a time where many have weak patience, weak minds th=\r\nat get influenced easily, it too lead many to dig in many places.\n\nEventual=\r\nly after clearing up one may attach to one form and dig only in one place.\n=\r\n\nSadhana doing attaching to a form is more easier than doing formless, I ha=\r\nve read this in many books but pardon my lack of actual experiance in eithe=\r\nr of them.\n\nOne must enjoy doing sadhana that one or she likes, enjoys and =\r\nfeels comfortable at a given point of time.

Siva is also reffere=\r\nd to as Bhakta sulabha (easy to get for devotees) where as Vishnu is expect=\r\ned to test the devotee.\n&gt; \n&gt; If we look at our mythological stories, most d=\r\naemons pray to Brahma or Siva and get boons easily compared Vishnu.\n&gt; \n&gt; Wh=\r\ny is this?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. Animal sacrifice - does any of the Gods/Goddess actually=\r\n want animal/human sacrifices? Even today, animal sacrifices are going on f=\r\nor local grama devatas (like Poturaju, Maridamma, Pocamma etc.)\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. Pra=\r\nying to multiple Gods/Goddess as opposed to praying to a single God/Goddess=\r\n\n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahansa once told a devotee, that if he digged at one pl=\r\nace, he would have got water as opposed to digging in multiple places.\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n I look at it differently (no dis-respect to the Takur).\n&gt; \n&gt; When we are d=\r\nigging a well, our final goal is to get water.\n&gt; Here two options are there=\r\n:\n&gt; Dig in muliple places or dig in the same place using multiple instrumen=\r\nts (use spade for some time, then use a spear for some time, and so on so).=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Here praying to different Gods should be compared to digging in diffe=\r\nrent places or digging with different instruments?\n&gt; \n&gt; I felt, the famous =\r\nargument against praying to multiple Gods is comparing it to digging in mul=\r\ntiple places.\n&gt; \n&gt; While Kali, Krishna, Ram, Bhairava all are different for=\r\nms of God, they all are the one and only Brahman and are aware of the fact.=\r\n\n&gt; If I am praying to Krishna with single intension of merging with Krishna=\r\n, then praying to Ram may perhaps do not help me. If I am praying to Krishn=\r\na with sole goal of overcoming my short comings and spiritual growth. In su=\r\nch a scenario, does it matter whether I pray to Krishna/Ram?\n&gt; \n&gt; I do reca=\r\nll the discussion about visualising the image of the God and that we get ma=\r\nntra sidhi when the thought fills out mind. How ever, not all of us are for=\r\ntunate to visualise a clear image. Most often when I try to visualise Rama/=\r\nKrishna, a famous Telugu actor who used to play those roles come to my imag=\r\nination. I feel, I may be better of with out a visualisation.\n&gt; \n&gt; I use a =\r\nShiv ling to invoke any God/Goddess along with fire.\n&gt; \n&gt; Is sticking to on=\r\ne God/mantra is really so critical?\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
