Ida nadi (lunar channel) is the channel of the soothing \ncomfort of feeling. The mantra you do and the praanaayaama you do may \nhave a small impact on which channel tends to open more, but the primary \ninfluence will be your basic attitude and aptitude. Ida nadi is more \nlikely to open in a humble, emotional and relaxed person. Pingala nadi \nis more likely to open in a logical, analytical and intelligent person. \nThus, targeting a nadi with praanaayaama and mantra does not add much \nvalue.\n\nGayatri mantra tends to open up Pingala more. Shiva mantras (e.g. \nPanchakshari) tend to open Ida more. However, it also depends on how you \nvisualize your god. For example, does Shiva stand for a relaxed mahayogi \nin bliss to you or the fiery Rudra of destruction?\n\n*        *        *\n\nMoreover, the goal is not to make shakti flow through Ida or Pingala \nanyway. The goal is that shakti flows through Sushumna nadi in the \nmiddle. All the higher worlds and deities in them lie within Sushumna \nnadi. Depending on the nature of mantra and your nature, Ida or Pingala \nmay open more and some vaayu may be flowing through it. But, when \nKundalini gets awakened oneday, Sushumna may also open and Kundalini may \nshoot up through Sushumna.\n\nMany people referring to Kundalini in higher chakras/nadis are actually \ntalking about the flow of vaayus there. Most people talking about \nKundalini have not experienced Kundalini itself in higher chakras.\n\nKundalini shakti is one&#39;s self-awareness. Shakti meeting Shiva is a \nmetaphor for individual self-awareness (shakti) merging in cosmic self \n(Shiva). A vaishnava may also view it as a Gopi meeting Krishna.\n\n*        *        *\n\nShakti will not rise unless one&#39;s awareness of physical body disappears. \nThe instruction of some teachers to focus on a particular chakra or a \nparticular body part to force Kundalini to rise is not wise. As long as \nyou think &quot;I am the body. Inside this body, there is a chakra or a body \npart. I will focus on that part inside this body&quot;, your self-awareness \nis unlikely to rise above the physical body. In other words, your \nKundalini is stuck in the mooladhara chakra corresponding to the \nphysical realm.\n\nWanting Kundalini to rise to X or Y chakra is unproductive. It never \nhappens that way. Whenever I had expected or anticipated something, \nnothing happened. Things happened spontaneously only when my mind was \nnearly empty and the focus on mantra/god became so intense that it \nfilled my mind. In fact, when I first experienced a Kundalini rise, I \ndid not even know much about Kundalini and chakras and considered all \nthose concepts as dirty Tantrik ideas that I wanted to do have nothing \nto do with. Only after experiencing did I understand what it was \nintellectually. Thus, intellectual analysis of Kundalini and chakras and \ntrying to manipulate them is unnecessary and, in fact, \ncounter-productive. If you want Kundalini to rise, do not even think in \nterms of Kundalini and chakras.\n\n*        *        *\n\nKundalini rises when and only when your self-awareness rises above the \nphysical body. The key is to forget that you are the body. The key is to \nNOT think that you are (or you are not) the body. The key is to forget \nabout the body completely. The key is to immerse the mind so deeply in \nthe mantra/deity that you forget everything else.\n\nAnd then patience. By being in a hurry that your Kundalini should rise, \nyou will only ensure that Kundalini remains in Mooladhara forever. As I \nsaid, stop thinking in terms of shakti and chakras, if shakti were to \nreally rise.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n   Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                   http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n      Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n      Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n   Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n                      Twitter ID: @homam108\n-------------------------------------------------------------------\n\n&gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you for answering my questions. Some of them have been silly\n&gt; trivial questions, and yet, you never tire of answering them. I am\n&gt; grateful.\n&gt;\n&gt; In some of your mails, you have written about the flow of shakti\n&gt; through the ida and pingala nadis, and how pranayama and mantra are\n&gt; linked to them. Is it a better to choose activities which &#39;activate&#39;\n&gt; the same nadi throughout? For example, if the pradhana homa mantra\n&gt; activates the ida nadi, is it better to &#39;activate&#39; the same nadi\n&gt; through pranayama, and also choose a mantra with works through the\n&gt; same nadi during meditation?\n&gt;\n&gt; If you have some experience with them, can you share the nadi\n&gt; affiliation for some common mantras like mahaganapati (shreem hriim\n&gt; kleem ...), shiva panchakshari, and &#39;om namo narayanaya&#39;. Do longer\n&gt; selections like chandi path also have an affiliation with one of the\n&gt; nadis?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thank you again.\n\n"}}
