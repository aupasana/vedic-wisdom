Just as ripples arise in ocean and the ripples forget that =\r\nthey are just ocean and form a separate identity and look at other parts of=\r\n the same ocean as different ripples/other objects, a part of Brahman forge=\r\nts that it is Brahman and forms a separate identity. It starts looking at o=\r\nther parts of Brahman as different objects.\n \nMoksha is when one completely=\r\n loses these false self-identities and realizes one&#39;s true nature, i.e. tha=\r\nt one is not a ripple but the ocean itself.\n \nThere are two kinds. In the f=\r\nirst kind, one enters a Nirvikalpa samadhi. One just merges in Brahman. One=\r\n no longer has any self-identification (e.g. &quot;I am Vikrant&quot;, &quot;I am Narasimh=\r\na&quot;, &quot;I am an astrologer&quot;, &quot;I am a good person&quot; etc). One neither perceives =\r\n&quot;self&quot; or &quot;other&quot;. One&#39;s perception is clear of any objects or duality. One=\r\n just swims in the bliss that true self is (sat-chid-ananda). There is no e=\r\nxperience. There is no self, no objects to be experienced and no experience=\r\n.\n \nIf one reaches this state and does not return from the state (Ramakrish=\r\nna Paramahamsa used to say &quot;salt doll went to measure the depth of the ocea=\r\nn and melted and mixed with the ocean&quot;), that is moksha.\n \nThe second kind =\r\nis even more difficult. In that kind, one enters Sahaja samadhi. One sees d=\r\nifferent objects of this dual world and interacts with those objects as if =\r\none is a limited object too. But yet, one fully realizes that all objects a=\r\nre non-different from Brahman. In terms of our ocean-ripple analogy, one re=\r\nalizes that one is not a ripple but ocean and yet acts like a ripple with o=\r\nther ripples without any corruption in the understanding that all is ocean.=\r\n Being rooted in non-duality perfectly while perceiving and acting in the d=\r\nual world is indeed difficult. One who reaches this state is living and yet=\r\n liberated (jeevanmukta). This is an extremely difficult thing.\n \nThere hav=\r\ne been many who got moksha, but very very very very few who got moksha whil=\r\ne living in the body and acting in the body. Yogis like Shirdi Sai Baba, Ra=\r\nmakrishna Paramahamsa and Ramana Maharshi are indeed rare.\n \nBTW, it is my =\r\nfeeling that you will benefit from performing Mahaganapathi homam with some=\r\n regularity.
