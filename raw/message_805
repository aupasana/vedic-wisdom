I have another doubt \n=\r\nsir and I hope you can clear it. I have been reading the book-They \nlived w=\r\nith God by Swami Chetanananda. In that book in the chapter \nrelated to Sri =\r\nRamakrishna&#39;s niece (Lakshmi) if I am not mistaken he \nsays that he will be=\r\n born again after 100 years and the Holy Mother \nand his neice will be born=\r\n along with him. As 100 years are already \nfinish is it possible that Sri R=\r\namakrishna is already living \nsomewhere in some other incarnation. Ho do we=\r\n recognize or identify \nhim? My other doubt is has anyone living at present=\r\n experienced \nNirvikalpa Samadhi? How does it feel when we are in that stat=\r\ne? \nHoping to receive your reply \n\nAnswer: Your observation in the book &quot;Th=\r\ney lived with God&quot; is \ncorrect. It is only those who are of the level of an=\r\n incarnation can \nrecognize another incarnation, unless one reveals himself=\r\n. In the \nmodern days there is no depth of fake god-men which makes it all =\r\nthe \nmore difficult to recognize. I feel if we have true devotion to the \ni=\r\nncarnation of the God as Sri Ramakrishna is sufficient for our \nspiritual p=\r\nrogress, instead of our trying to judge an incarnation \nperson. \nSince you =\r\nhave come across this statement in the book of Swami \nChetananandaji, if yo=\r\nu desire you can send your question to him.

He will come again after one hundred years in the \n&gt; &gt; n=\r\northwest direction.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; A Devotee: &quot;Did the Master say that he would be bo=\r\nrn in the \n&gt; Punjab?&quot;\n&gt; &gt; Vijnanananda: &quot;No, the Master did not say that he=\r\n would be born \nin \n&gt; &gt; the Punjab.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; Swami Abhedananda recalled: &quot;One =\r\nevening Sri Ramakrishna was \n&gt; &gt; attended by his faithful attendants Shashi=\r\n [Ramakrishnananda] \nand \n&gt; &gt; Kali [Abhedananda], who were waiting upon him=\r\n at Cossipore. The \n&gt; &gt; Master inspired them by saying: &#39;My Divine Mother h=\r\nas shown me \n&gt; that \n&gt; &gt; the photograph of this body will be kept upon alta=\r\nrs and be \n&gt; &gt; worshipped in different houses as the pictures of other avat=\r\nars \n&gt; are \n&gt; &gt; worshipped. My Divine Mother has also shown me that I shall=\r\n have \n&gt; to \n&gt; &gt; come back again and that my next incarnation will be in th=\r\ne \n&gt; West.&#39;&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; !....!....!\n&gt; &gt; On different occasions the Holy Moth=\r\ner made various statements \n&gt; about \n&gt; &gt; the Master&#39;s return. Once she reca=\r\nlled: &quot;The Master said he \nwould \n&gt; &gt; come again after a hundred years. Mea=\r\nnwhile, for those hundred \n&gt; years \n&gt; &gt; he would live in the hearts of thos=\r\ne who love him. Standing on \nthe \n&gt; &gt; semicircular veranda of Dakshineswar,=\r\n the Master said this, \n&gt; pointing \n&gt; &gt; towards the northwest. I told him I=\r\n could not come again. \nLakshmi \n&gt; &gt; also said she would not come again, ev=\r\nen if she were chopped \ninto \n&gt; &gt; shreds like tobacco leaves! The Master la=\r\nughed and said: &#39;How \ncan \n&gt; &gt; you avoid coming? Our roots are twined toget=\r\nher like the kalmi \n&gt; &gt; plant. Pull one stem and the whole clump comes forw=\r\nard.&#39;&quot;  \n&gt; &gt; The Holy Mother also stated: &quot;The Master said that he would \nd=\r\nwell \n&gt; in \n&gt; &gt; the hearts of his devotees for a hundred years in his subtl=\r\ne \nbody. \n&gt; &gt; He further said that he would have many devotees among the wh=\r\nite \n&gt; &gt; people.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; Swami Saradananda wrote on this subject in Sri Ramak=\r\nrishna and \nHis \n&gt; &gt; Divine Play: &quot;The Master not only knew this about hims=\r\nelf \nthrough \n&gt; &gt; his yogic insight, but he also told us many times, pointi=\r\nng to \nthe \n&gt; &gt; northwest, that the next time he would reincarnate there. S=\r\nome \nof \n&gt; us \n&gt; &gt; (Girish Chandra Ghosh and others) said that the Master e=\r\nven told \n&gt; &gt; them the time of his advent, stating: &#39;I shall have to be bor=\r\nn \nin \n&gt; &gt; that direction after two hundred years. Then many will be \n&gt; lib=\r\nerated, \n&gt; &gt; and those who fail at that time will have to wait a long time =\r\n\nfor \n&gt; &gt; liberation.&#39;&quot; \n&gt; &gt; !....!....!\n&gt; &gt; Ramakrishna&#39;s niece Lakshmi sa=\r\nid: &quot;The Master said, &#39;I shall \ncome \n&gt; &gt; back after 100 years.&#39; I can&#39;t de=\r\nfinitely say whether that year \n&gt; &gt; should be counted from his birth, or de=\r\nath, or on the day when \nhe \n&gt; &gt; said it.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; !....!....!\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; -=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Dinesh Nambisan&quot; &lt;dinesh@&gt; \n&gt; &gt; wrote:=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I vaguely recall reading somewhere that Shri Ra=\r\nmakrishna \n&gt; &gt; Paramahamsa once stated that he \n&gt; &gt; &gt; would be reborn in 10=\r\n0 or 150 years time, can anyone kindly \n&gt; verify \n&gt; &gt; whether that statemen=\r\nt \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is indeed true; and if so kindly provide a reference to the \ntext =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; that has that quote?
