Apparently some yogi did \nintense sadhana there for=\r\n a few decades in the past (with the mantra \nyou mentioned). The mantra abo=\r\nve is written all over the walls of the \ntemple.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Though that yogi i=\r\ns not there now, the vibrations created by his \nsadhana are still there. We=\r\n were quite impressed when we spent some \ntime there. You have to take a bo=\r\nat to go from Dwaarakaa to \nBrihadDwaarakaa and then go inside the village =\r\n(a few km from the \nmain Krishna temple at BrihadDwaarakaa) . It is a very =\r\nsmall temple \nwithout any crowd, but has stronger spiritual energy than man=\r\ny famous \ntemples.

Sometime ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to \nany Hanuman te=\r\nmple and get a mantra for lifting up the Mangal in my \nnatal chart which su=\r\nffers from rajabhanga (uccha in rasi and neecha \nin navamsa). When I visite=\r\nd the Hanuman deity in Sri Veetirundha \nPerumal temple, Thirumazhisai near =\r\nChennai and asked the priest about \na mantra, he advised me to chant the ma=\r\nntra inscribed on the walls of \nthe temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram|=\r\n which comes out to be a 7 \nword, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy from the 7th h=\r\nouse to the 10th house \nwith the mantra devata sitting in lagna as per mant=\r\nra shastra \nteachings. I&#39;ve been doing this every evening since.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; La=\r\nter I came to know this is the Rama taraka mantra. My question is \nhow does=\r\n this mantra help to counter the rajabhanga of Mangal?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Secondly wha=\r\nt is the correct form of the Rama taraka mantra? Is it\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; |om sri ram =\r\njaya ram jaya jaya ram| - 8 words, 11 aksharas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; or\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; |om sri r=\r\nama jaya rama jaya jaya rama|? - 8 words, 14 aksharas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Some say it s=\r\nhould be 13 aksharas....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Sorry for astrological content in this mai=\r\nl.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; best regards\n&gt; Hari\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
