I had been doing daily Ganapathi homam for the last couple of mont=\r\nhs and I feel a lot connected to God this way. For the Ganesha Chaturthi th=\r\nat is day after tomorrow, is it enough if just do the Ganesha Homam with Sh=\r\nodasa upacharas and recite the story later, instead of the traditional &quot;Vin=\r\nayaka Vratham&quot; or should I also do that in addition to the homam?\n\n2. Is it=\r\n okay to reuse the left over ghee for the next day homam? Because I am doin=\r\ng daily homam, there is some ghee remaining everyday which I ask my wife to=\r\n use for the regular consumption with food. But she keeps complaining that =\r\nit smelling like smoke, which I suspect is happening because we take shruk =\r\nand shruvam so close to fire and dip in the ghee again multiple times. So, =\r\nhow about re-using the remaining ghee with some fresh ghee mixed together f=\r\nor the next day homam?\n\nNagraj \n\n\n"}}
