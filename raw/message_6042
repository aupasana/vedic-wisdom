He got it from some so=\r\nurce and started giving Ahutis with the Mantra during his Maha-Ganapati Hom=\r\nam. As he has written, First day he had troubles in office and 2nd day his =\r\nbike was stolen resulting in his shaken confidence due to obvious worries.\n=\r\n\nLooking at the situation, IMHO, it is very early to think about stopping t=\r\nhe same. Though intentions for specifically invoking Mother Bagalamukhi is =\r\nnot known, I believe that it was for some or the other Saatwik desire (Even=\r\n it may have been mundane and not speeding up spiritual progress). Also, it=\r\n defies the logic to attach incidences to Homam with experiences of just a =\r\ncouple of days.\nFor that matter, even Maha-Ganapati Homam was not easy if I=\r\n take my own personal experiences. I have chiefly performed Maha-Ganapati H=\r\nomas as well as Chandi homas and I have had many set backs and some good th=\r\nings as well but again those are all part & parcel of life. Even without Ho=\r\nmam, one may experience such dualistic situations.\n\nI understand your insis=\r\ntence and your prudent advice to worship Soumya Devatas and I agree to your=\r\n logic which is most probably out of your experiences, however I also think=\r\n that Ugra Devata should not be that fearful while Soumya Devatas are not t=\r\nhat Goody-goody. Ultimately, it is all about attraction/liking for a partic=\r\nular deity. It is my personal view that one needs to decide upon a Homam of=\r\n a deity (Ugra or Soumya Devata or Ugra-Soumya in external Nature) to which=\r\n one feels most attracted and then forget about the rest. It would be a des=\r\ntabilizing effect on mind of a person to start judging and relating day to =\r\nday experiences with homam. The chosen deity can be Maha-Ganapati or Chandi=\r\n or Krishna or Shiva or Hanuman or any other deity. Once person starts surr=\r\nendering to the chosen deity, one is in safe hands. Even if things starts g=\r\noing wrong, one need not despair and should keep faith till it is impossibl=\r\ne because if God exist, there never would be a breaking point and that hold=\r\ns true for all of us whether we have families to look after or not.\nI compl=\r\netely tend to agree and hence repeat for benefits of others that Ganapati i=\r\ns not a Lower devata. He is capable of everything. If one has a great likin=\r\ng for him, one can keep on performing his homam without need of switching. =\r\nActually to switch from Maha-Ganapati Homam to some other deity is NOT chan=\r\nging of Levels (especially from Lower to upper) which some may think.\n\nBest=\r\n Regards,\nUtpal\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pv=\r\nr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; The point raised by Biswajit is a genuin=\r\ne one.\n&gt; \n&gt; Spiritual progress requires freedom from the burden of some key=\r\n blocking \n&gt; karmas. One way to be free from a karma is to experience the r=\r\neaction to \n&gt; it in full (in due course of time). Another way is to burn it=\r\n in \n&gt; sadhana. When one meditates or helps people or engages in various \n&gt;=\r\n spiritual practices also, some karmas are getting burnt and being taken \n&gt;=\r\n off one&#39;s kaarmik pipeline. Sadhanas like homam accelerate that process. \n=\r\n&gt; Homam of ugra devatas accelerates it further. The distinction is between =\r\n\n&gt; soumya devatas and ugra devatas is a very important one.\n&gt; \n&gt; I gave thi=\r\ns analogy a few times before. Suppose there is a basket \n&gt; containing fruit=\r\ns (your karmas). Suppose a good fruit (good karma) is \n&gt; stuck under some r=\r\notten fruits (bad karmas). When you do sadhana, the \n&gt; deity (personificati=\r\non of certain good qualities within you, which are \n&gt; being  strengthened a=\r\ns you do the sadhana) re-arranges the kaarmik \n&gt; pipeline. In terms of the =\r\nanalogy, some rotten fruits are taken out and \n&gt; thrown in garbage and the =\r\ngood fruit is given to you to eat. If this is \n&gt; done slowly and carefully,=\r\n it takes longer to take the good fruit out, \n&gt; but the spillage of rotten =\r\nfruit pieces on the floor is minimized. This \n&gt; is the way of soumya devata=\r\ns (gentle deities). If this is done fast and \n&gt; aggressively, the good frui=\r\nt comes out faster, but the spillage of \n&gt; rotten fruit pieces is more. Thi=\r\ns is the way of ugra devatas (fierce \n&gt; deities). It is a tradeoff.\n&gt; \n&gt; * =\r\n       *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; As I recommended before, those who want their materi=\r\nal life to go \n&gt; smoothly and not in a hurry for spiritual progress should =\r\nstick to \n&gt; soumya devatas. Ganapathi, Lakshmi, Saraswati, Vishnu, Krishna =\r\netc can \n&gt; be worshipped in fire. Once one starts worshipping fierce forms =\r\nlike \n&gt; Chandi, Durga, Narasimha, Rudra, Bhiarava, Mahakala etc, especially=\r\n in \n&gt; fire, things CAN be too fast for them to handle.\n&gt; \n&gt; In fact, it is=\r\n a good idea to just stick to Ganapathi homam for a few \n&gt; months, before s=\r\ntarting to worship any other deity. There is no need to \n&gt; be in a hurry to=\r\n &quot;graduate&quot; from Ganapathi to somebody else. Ganapathi \n&gt; is now lower and =\r\nis capable of giving everything.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Most people =\r\ntoday do not understand Mahavidyas at all. For example, \n&gt; based on literal=\r\n meanings of some scriptural sayings, they think that \n&gt; Bagalamukhi is for=\r\n success over enemies and success in litigation etc. \n&gt; Some people suggest=\r\n specific Mahavidya sadhanas for material benefits \n&gt; based on horoscopic c=\r\nombinations.\n&gt; \n&gt; Vidya means knowledge. Mahavidya means supreme knowledge.=\r\n No knowledge \n&gt; that enables one to win court cases or defeat enemies or t=\r\no get other \n&gt; temporary material results can be termed as &quot;supreme&quot; knowle=\r\ndge. \n&gt; Mahavidyas are far more serious. They stand for different aspects o=\r\nf the \n&gt; knowledge of Self, which is the only supreme knowledge. They are t=\r\nhe \n&gt; liberating forms of the divine Mother.\n&gt; \n&gt; Most people on earth toda=\r\ny are unready for their worship. People today \n&gt; need deities who can take =\r\ncare of material things and give some push \n&gt; spiritually. That&#39;s it. Serio=\r\nus liberating forces such as Mahavidyas are \n&gt; inappropriate for one who wo=\r\nrries about little things. I mean no \n&gt; disrespect - worrying about little =\r\nthings is not unusual for most people \n&gt; and is ok - but then think twice b=\r\nefore worshipping Mahavidyas, \n&gt; especially in a fruitful medium such as fi=\r\nre. Fire amplifies the impact \n&gt; of the mantra and surrounding thoughts on =\r\nthe subtle body and \n&gt; accelerates the results, compared to normal meditati=\r\non.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; Consider the above words carefully and sk=\r\nip ugra devatas and Mahavidyas, \n&gt; atleast for a while in the beginning.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Also, in the beginning, some mistakes may be made. Just as Shiva drank \n=\r\n&gt; the poison that came out first during the churning of milky ocean, Guru \n=\r\n&gt; gives protection in the beginning. If you have a spiritual guru, think \n&gt;=\r\n of him/her before the homam.\n&gt; \n&gt; If you don&#39;t, you may think of me or my =\r\nguru Dr Manish Pandit. Better \n&gt; yet, think of Shri Tembe Swami (Shri Vasud=\r\nevananda Saraswati Maharaj), \n&gt; Shri Gulwani Maharaj (Yogiraj Shri Vaman Ra=\r\no Dattatreya Gulwani), Shri \n&gt; Nakhate Maharaj and Manish Pandit. That is m=\r\ny Guru parampara.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, you can also think of Dattatreya or Krish=\r\nna or Shiva as your \n&gt; guru based on your inclination.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt;=\r\n Narasimha\n&gt; --------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----\n&gt;    Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&gt;=\r\n &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n&gt;      =\r\n              http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt;       Films that make a diff=\r\nerence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n&gt;       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo=\r\n.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt;    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/grou=\r\np/JyotishWritings\n&gt;                       Twitter ID: @homam108\n&gt; ---------=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; On Fri, =\r\nMar 25, 2011 at 1:30 PM, biswa108 wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt;     NAMASKAR\n&gt; \n&gt; Well, got t=\r\nhe point... but my point is Whether I am ready for burning \n&gt; kermik debit =\r\nwith this kind of speed...
