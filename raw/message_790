Generally, I check messages once in a month.\n=C2=A0\nI would like to share=\r\n with you that I have been doing various mantras for=C2=A0more than=C2=A0fo=\r\nur years and now for past sometime, when I chant mantras, sometimes I get s=\r\nome thoughts or say realization or some answers that I am not actively look=\r\ning for. It seems that these thoughts are coming directly from somewhere an=\r\nd I accept that these thoughts or knowledge or whatever you say (realizatio=\r\nn, light) is directly from God. \n=C2=A0\nSome of these thoughts, I don&#39;t sha=\r\nre with anybody. Some I share with few of my very close friend. I would sha=\r\nre some with you on this group as per time permits me.\n=C2=A0\nToday, in thi=\r\ns world, people think that Astrology is just about knowing future and how t=\r\no avoid the mishappenings / bad times by paying many. This is what most ot =\r\nthe people believe.\n=C2=A0\nAstrology is a light and life is a journey. Say =\r\nyou are on a journey for the whole earth, you want to see the whole earth b=\r\ny walking on foot and this is your journey. Now as you walk, there can be v=\r\narious things cities, lakes, rivers, forests, deserts, mountains etc. but a=\r\ns life is also a journey you do not know what lies ahead a beautiful resort=\r\n or a wild long desert with no water no shade. As I said astrology is a lig=\r\nht and God has given different power to everybody to foresee his future. So=\r\n, in this journey, you take out your light and tries to foresee (say there =\r\nis a winter and there is lot of fog) and despite your powerful torchlight, =\r\nyou can see only few metres or say maximum one kilometre. Say, if you see a=\r\n desert what will you do. Well this is a journey (like life) and you cannot=\r\n stop or go back as time will automatically carry you forward. So what you =\r\nwill do at your best. May be you will try to take some water or can buy a u=\r\nmbrella with you\n before you reach to the desert to minimize your pain or s=\r\ntruggle time.\n=C2=A0\nOfcourse you cannot change it nor can you have a tanke=\r\nr of water to carry with you. So here storing water is what we call remedie=\r\ns. We all to have to go through the journey of life and the end point is sa=\r\nme for everybody (death), however the path is different for everybody.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nDo not see astrology as definitive answer to solve all your queries, an=\r\nswers, problems. It&#39;s a light and light cannot alter the journey.\n=C2=A0\nRe=\r\ngards,\n=C2=A0\nNeeraj Gupta\n\n--- On Tue, 11/25/08, Narasimha P.V.R. Rao &lt;pvr=\r\n@...&gt; wrote:\n\nFrom: Narasimha P.V.R.

This is an unbelievable experience that=\r\n I\nhave had. I have not added anything from my own. I am writing exactly\nas=\r\n was happened in my life. I am going back to the period of 1973/74.\nKindly =\r\nread this only when you are in religious mood.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; I was working as =\r\ntelegraphist at Okha Port Post office near Dwarka.\nMy duty was from 7 am to=\r\n 7 pm and I was getting late fee allowance for\nextra duty. There was a Tele=\r\nphone exchange just opposite to Post\noffice and due to same Dep=E2=80=99t; =\r\nI had friendship with some Telephone\noperators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Patel, (w=\r\ne will call him as Mr. Patel)\nwas working as Operator. He was a staunch dev=\r\notee of=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 shri\nRamkrishnadev. Whenever I was meeting him he=\r\n was always talking about\nshri Thakur. We came close day by day. There was =\r\na weekly gathering at\nhis home called SATSANGA. He was singing devotional s=\r\nongs created by\nhim and was weeping while singing. He was reading Ramkrishn=\r\na\nKathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attending this weekly meeting\non =\r\nSaturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. Patel was of 30\nthen. We wer=\r\ne used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after duty hours\nand were talking on=\r\nly about Thakur.\n&gt; One day when we were at sea shore he suddenly told me--=\r\n=E2=80=9CRawalbhai,\nsome guest have come to my home and my wife is remember=\r\ning me. My son\nwill come in a few minutes to call me. I shall have to go no=\r\nw=E2=80=9D. --\nAnd with my surprise his 8 years old son came to call him. \n=\r\n&gt; At one another incident he told me that there will be a plane crash\ntomor=\r\nrow and that also happened. I was very much impressed about him.\nHe could f=\r\noresee the events. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he\ntold me not to =\r\ngo through bus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I\nwent to Bus station bu=\r\nt bus did not come from Dwarka as was punctured\non the way. This was surpri=\r\nsing.\n&gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super power\n=\r\nand this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to\nshri Tha=\r\nkur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri\nThakur and the da=\r\ny came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself\nto Thakur at Mr. Pate=\r\nl=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed him\ndeeply from my heart =\r\nto accept me as his follower and bestow his grace. \n&gt; Next day morning I ha=\r\nd a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning\nwhile taking the tea. As my dut=\r\ny was to start from 7 am I was waking\nup at 5.45 morning. I told to my wife=\r\n in the morning that I have\naccepted Shri Ramkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My w=\r\nife was annoyed and she\nargued with me a lot. =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CW=\r\nhy should you take such a hasty decision?\nRamkrishna Paramhamsa was a devot=\r\nee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a\ngreat Saint but our Guru should be liv=\r\ning one, who can guide us, give\nus Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa fr=\r\nom Shri Ram Sharma Acharya\nsince you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.\n&gt;=\r\n Her arguments were right at her place as people in general not know\nmuch a=\r\nbout Thakur and I was confused. I thought-- yes I have taken\nhasty decision=\r\n. I was in the influence of Mr. Patel. --\n&gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel h=\r\nad told me that Thakur was telling\ntheir disciples to test him before accep=\r\nting him. I also decided to\ntest Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =\r\n=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has\nnever come to our home. You =\r\nhave also not seen him. He has never asked\nme where I am living. Suppose Mr=\r\n. Patel is coming to our house within\n10 to 15 minutes, would you believe t=\r\nhat my selection for Thakur is\nperfect?=E2=80=9D--\n&gt; She laughed at me=EF=\r\n=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t believe.=E2=80=\r\n=9D--\n&gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately to justify my\nde=\r\ncision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test your existence even\nto=\r\nday.=E2=80=99\n&gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Patel was at my home at 06.30 in=\r\n the\nmorning with angry mood. What he told?\n&gt; =E2=80=98 How dare you test T=\r\nhakur this way? Do you know what happened?\nYesterday was my night duty and =\r\nI had just come to my home at 05.30\nmornings today and tried to sleep for 1=\r\n or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur\npulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C G=\r\no to your friend=E2=80=99s house. He\nis waiting for you. He wants to test m=\r\ne.

One was Swami yogeshwarji who lived=\r\n his life in Himalayas and other was Mr. Nathalal from Gondal, Saurashtra, =\r\nGujarat. I have met all these three. All were on very high state of mind an=\r\nd living spiritual life. It is beyond our capacity to judge what is right a=\r\nnd what is hallucination. ..!&nbsp; As Mr. Narsimhaji told I believe only T=\r\nhakur as he is alive for me today.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;FONT face=3D&quot;comic sans ms&quot; colo=\r\nr=3D#212143&gt;&lt;STRONG&gt;Dr.Ashwin Rawal&lt;/STRONG&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- On &lt;B&gt;Sun, 9=\r\n/11/08, Shiv &lt;I&gt;&lt;theblisswithin@ yahoo.com&gt;&lt;/I&gt;&lt;/B&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;BLOCK=\r\nQUOTE style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: rgb(16,16,255) 2px solid&quot;&gt;From: Shiv &lt;thebli=\r\nsswithin@ yahoo.com&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Shri Shri THAKUR is =\r\nstill alive today&lt;BR&gt;To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;Date: Sunday, 9 =\r\nNovember, 2008, 9:19 PM&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv624311862&gt;\n&lt;DIV id=3Dygrp-text=\r\n&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Respected Ashwinji&lt;BR&gt;This is a very good and inspiring thread. &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nI would like to mention something that may be an interesting insight.&lt;BR&gt;Yo=\r\nu mentioned Pt Shriram Sharma Acharya.

This is an unbelievable experience that I&lt;BR&gt;have had. I have not =\r\nadded anything from my own. I am writing exactly&lt;BR&gt;as was happened in my l=\r\nife. I am going back to the period of 1973/74.&lt;BR&gt;Kindly read this only whe=\r\nn you are in religious mood.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I was working as telegr=\r\naphist at Okha Port Post office near Dwarka.&lt;BR&gt;My duty was from 7 am to 7 =\r\npm and I was getting late fee allowance for&lt;BR&gt;extra duty. There was a Tele=\r\nphone exchange just opposite to Post&lt;BR&gt;office and due to same Dep=E2=80=99=\r\nt; I had friendship with some Telephone&lt;BR&gt;operators. One Mr. Ramanbhai Pat=\r\nel, (we will call him as Mr. Patel)&lt;BR&gt;was working as Operator. He was a st=\r\naunch devotee of&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;\n shri&lt;BR&gt;Ramkrishnadev. Whenever I was m=\r\neeting him he was always talking about&lt;BR&gt;shri Thakur. We came close day by=\r\n day. There was a weekly gathering at&lt;BR&gt;his home called SATSANGA. He was s=\r\ninging devotional songs created by&lt;BR&gt;him and was weeping while singing. He=\r\n was reading Ramkrishna&lt;BR&gt;Kathamrita. We 10 to 12 youngsters were attendin=\r\ng this weekly meeting&lt;BR&gt;on Saturday evening. I was then 24 years old. Mr. =\r\nPatel was of 30&lt;BR&gt;then. We were used to go to seashore daily at 7 pm after=\r\n duty hours&lt;BR&gt;and were talking only about Thakur.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One day when we =\r\nwere at sea shore he suddenly told me--=E2=80=9CRawalbhai,&lt;BR&gt;some guest ha=\r\nve come to my home and my wife is remembering me. My son&lt;BR&gt;will come in a =\r\nfew minutes to call me. I shall have to go now=E2=80=9D. --&lt;BR&gt;And with my =\r\nsurprise his 8 years old son came to call him. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; At one another inci=\r\ndent he told me that there will be a plane crash&lt;BR&gt;tomorrow and that also =\r\nhappened. I was very much impressed\n about him.&lt;BR&gt;He could foresee the eve=\r\nnts. One day I had to go to Dwarka by Bus, he&lt;BR&gt;told me not to go through =\r\nbus, as bus tire will be punctured. Yet I&lt;BR&gt;went to Bus station but bus di=\r\nd not come from Dwarka as was punctured&lt;BR&gt;on the way. This was surprising.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; This all incidents made me to believe that he had some super power=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;and this was due to Ramkrishandev worship only. I was attracted to&lt;BR&gt;s=\r\nhri Thakur. One day I thought, I should also be disciple of shri&lt;BR&gt;Thakur =\r\nand the day came. It was 4/4/1974. At 7 pm I surrendered myself&lt;BR&gt;to Thaku=\r\nr at Mr. Patel=E2=80=99s house before Thakur picture. I prayed him&lt;BR&gt;deepl=\r\ny from my heart to accept me as his follower and bestow his grace. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Next day morning I had a discussion with my wife at 6.10 morning&lt;BR&gt;while =\r\ntaking the tea. As my duty was to start from 7 am I was waking&lt;BR&gt;up at 5.4=\r\n5 morning. I told to my wife in the morning that I have&lt;BR&gt;accepted Shri Ra=\r\nmkrishnadev as my Gurudev. My wife\n was annoyed and she&lt;BR&gt;argued with me a=\r\n lot. =EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CWhy should you take such a hasty decision=\r\n?&lt;BR&gt;Ramkrishna Paramhamsa was a devotee of Maa Kali at Calcutta. He was a&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;great Saint but our Guru should be living one, who can guide us, give&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;us Mantra etc. etc. Better you take Dixa from Shri Ram Sharma Acharya&lt;BR&gt;s=\r\nince you are doing Gayatri Mantra=E2=80=9D--.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Her arguments were ri=\r\nght at her place as people in general not know&lt;BR&gt;much about Thakur and I w=\r\nas confused. I thought-- yes I have taken&lt;BR&gt;hasty decision. I was in the i=\r\nnfluence of Mr. Patel. --&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But I remember that Mr. Patel had told me=\r\n that Thakur was telling&lt;BR&gt;their disciples to test him before accepting hi=\r\nm. I also decided to&lt;BR&gt;test Thakur. I immediately told my wife that =EF=BF=\r\n=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CSee, Mr. Patel has&lt;BR&gt;never come to our home. You hav=\r\ne also not seen him. He has never asked&lt;BR&gt;me where I am living. Suppose Mr=\r\n. Patel is coming to our house within&lt;BR&gt;10 to 15 minutes, would you\n belie=\r\nve that my selection for Thakur is&lt;BR&gt;perfect?=E2=80=9D--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; She laugh=\r\ned at me=EF=BF=BD=EF=BF=BD&quot;=E2=80=9CHow it is possible? I don=E2=80=99t bel=\r\nieve.=E2=80=9D--&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I prayed Shri Thakur to send Mr. Patel immediately=\r\n to justify my&lt;BR&gt;decision and convince my wife. =E2=80=98I want to test yo=\r\nur existence even&lt;BR&gt;today.=E2=80=99&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To our great surprise, Mr. Pat=\r\nel was at my home at 06.30 in the&lt;BR&gt;morning with angry mood. What he told?=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =E2=80=98 How dare you test Thakur this way? Do you know what happ=\r\nened?&lt;BR&gt;Yesterday was my night duty and I had just come to my home at 05.3=\r\n0&lt;BR&gt;mornings today and tried to sleep for 1 or 2 hours. Suddenly Thakur&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;pulled my blanket and told me that-=E2=80=9C Go to your friend=E2=80=99s h=\r\nouse. He&lt;BR&gt;is waiting for you. He wants to test me. I will show you his ho=\r\nuse=E2=80=9D&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I immediately rushed to your home. Thakur was guiding =\r\nme the way to&lt;BR&gt;your house and pushing me too. What you want? Why you are =\r\ndisturbing&lt;BR&gt;him in such an early morning for such a silly\n things?=E2=80=\r\n=99&lt;BR&gt;&gt; We both were so excited and surprised that we had no words that=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;Morning. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I will never forget that 5th April, a miracle day in =\r\nmy life. There&lt;BR&gt;were some more Devine experiences about Shri Thakur but I=\r\n will write&lt;BR&gt;it sometime.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Sir, and forum members, Ramkrishan=\r\ndev is still alive on the&lt;BR&gt;earth.
