So you may do either.\n&gt;  \n&gt; However, some combinations tried b=\r\ny others successfully in the past \nare better and faster.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Regarding t=\r\nhe specific mantra below: The words &quot;raam&quot; and &quot;jay&quot; \n(or &quot;jai&quot;) have no me=\r\naning in Sanskrit. They should be &quot;raama&quot; \nand &quot;jaya&quot; respectively. Arabic =\r\nhas words mostly ending in consonants \n(i.e. no vowel &quot;a&quot; at the end of the=\r\n word). That Arabic influence \nmade Indians change Sanskrit words to remove=\r\n &quot;a&quot; at the end of \nwords. &quot;Jaya Raama&quot; becomes &quot;Jay Raam&quot;.\n&gt;  \n&gt; If you wa=\r\nnt your mantra to be meaningful in Sanskrit, please \nrestore &quot;a&quot; at the end=\r\n of words. The correct version of the mantra \nis &quot;Sree Raama Jaya Raama Jay=\r\na Jaya Raama&quot;. You can add &quot;Om&quot; at the \nbeginning.\n&gt;  \n&gt; *        *        =\r\n*\n&gt;  \n&gt; On our India trip in the summer of 2008, I and my guru went to many=\r\n \ntemples. There was one remote temple in BriahdDwaraka that had a nice \nle=\r\nvel of spiritual vibrations. It is a temple of Hanuman and \nMakaradhwaja (H=\r\nanuman&#39;s son) together. Apparently some yogi did \nintense sadhana there for=\r\n a few decades in the past (with the mantra \nyou mentioned). The mantra abo=\r\nve is written all over the walls of the \ntemple.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though that yogi is =\r\nnot there now, the vibrations created by his \nsadhana are still there. We w=\r\nere quite impressed when we spent some \ntime there. You have to take a boat=\r\n to go from Dwaarakaa to \nBrihadDwaarakaa and then go inside the village (a=\r\n few km from the \nmain Krishna temple at BrihadDwaarakaa). It is a very sma=\r\nll temple \nwithout any crowd, but has stronger spiritual energy than many f=\r\namous \ntemples. If any of you go to Dwaraka or Gujarat in general, I \nrecom=\r\nmend visiting that temple and spending a couple of hours there.\n&gt;  \n&gt; The m=\r\nantra you gave reminded me of that temple.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a=\r\n Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarp=\r\nanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http:=\r\n//groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://=\r\nvedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.V=\r\nedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJaga=\r\nnnath.org\n&gt; ---------------------------------------------------------------=\r\n--- \n&gt; \n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: Jyotisa Shisya \n&gt;   To:=\r\n vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt;   Sent: Tuesday, January 27, 2009 7:48 AM\n=\r\n&gt;   Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Kuja (Mars) homam manual available now\n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt;   |om|\n&gt;   Dear Fellow travellers, namaste\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   All this talk abou=\r\nt Mangal reminds me about one question I&#39;ve had \nfor quite sometime. Someti=\r\nme ago, Sanjayji had advised me to go to \nany Hanuman temple and get a mant=\r\nra for lifting up the Mangal in my \nnatal chart which suffers from rajabhan=\r\nga (uccha in rasi and neecha \nin navamsa). When I visited the Hanuman deity=\r\n in Sri Veetirundha \nPerumal temple, Thirumazhisai near Chennai and asked t=\r\nhe priest about \na mantra, he advised me to chant the mantra inscribed on t=\r\nhe walls of \nthe temple |sri ram jaya ram jaya jaya ram| which comes out to=\r\n be a 7 \nword, 10 aksharas mantra. Energy from the 7th house to the 10th ho=\r\nuse \nwith the mantra devata sitting in lagna as per mantra shastra \nteachin=\r\ngs. I&#39;ve been doing this every evening since.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Later I came to kno=\r\nw this is the Rama taraka mantra. My question \nis how does this mantra help=\r\n to counter the rajabhanga of Mangal?\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Secondly what is the correc=\r\nt form of the Rama taraka mantra? Is it\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   |om sri ram jaya ram jaya=\r\n jaya ram| - 8 words, 11 aksharas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   or\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   |om sri rama jaya =\r\nrama jaya jaya rama|? - 8 words, 14 aksharas\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Some say it should b=\r\ne 13 aksharas....\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   Sorry for astrological content in this mail.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt;   best regards\n&gt;   Hari\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
