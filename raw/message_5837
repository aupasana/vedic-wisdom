Background is that I am definitely going through a bad pat=\r\nch after my dad&#39;s passing about 7 months ago. Recently, in my dreams I have=\r\n witnessed intense suffering (and when witnessing it I somehow &quot;knew&quot; it wa=\r\ns the worst suffering possible in this universe). Note that I say witnessed=\r\n and not experienced. In the dream one moment I was outside in the bright s=\r\nunlight, then suddenly was drawn into an underground railway station and in=\r\nto a train I didnt want to be in. A woman on the train told me it is going =\r\nto Praarthak, Pravarthak (some such word). I wanted to get out, and take th=\r\ne next train back. But it kept taking me on. I knew somehow it was going to=\r\n take me to 7 stations, I dont know how. At each of the 7 stations, all und=\r\nerground without light, were &quot;half formed people&quot; in absolute, unbelievable=\r\n darkness, pain and misery. They were in a sense &quot;trying to get their ident=\r\nity together&quot; without as much as a ray of hope or light. The suffering was =\r\ntoo intense. I felt like they/their pain would overwhelm me and draw me int=\r\no them/the pain/their-closed-suffering-filled-darkness for eternity, but I =\r\nwas not them. Simultaneously, I have had other dreams in which someone is a=\r\nround me, trying to get to/into me.\n\nI have also been doing meditations in =\r\nwhich I am trying to open my heart, let my emotions out (I am very reserved=\r\n by nature). These meditations are quite cathartic and give me peace at the=\r\n end. But here is my fear: I feel this &quot;opening myself out internally&quot; is a=\r\nttracting some huge external negativity of some kind. Is this possible? Or =\r\nis it simply my own bad karma of the past that is being revealed to me? How=\r\n do I tell if this negativity is to be experienced and suffered (if it is m=\r\ny own), or is to be avoided (if it is someone else)?\n\nRegards,\n\nSundeep\n\n\n\n=\r\n\n\n\n\n\n&gt; \n&gt; Namaste Priya,\n&gt; \n&gt; As Atul ji said, one has to experience variou=\r\ns positives and negatives \n&gt; before tasting Amrita, based on one&#39;s kaarmik =\r\ndebts and conditioning. \n&gt; People reap their good and bad karmas over time =\r\nand go through \n&gt; pleasurable and painful situations. We cannot change the =\r\nwhole world or \n&gt; make people avoid the fruits of their karmas. When we obs=\r\nerve people \n&gt; suffering, we should do something about it if there is somet=\r\nhing we can \n&gt; do and it feels like the right thing to do. Otheriwse, we sh=\r\nould just \n&gt; observe and move on.\n&gt; \n&gt; Next time something like this happen=\r\ns, try not to be scared or upset. \n&gt; Try to tell yourself that you are just=\r\n an observer. Feeling \n&gt; compassionate about someone&#39;s problems is one thin=\r\ng and identifying with \n&gt; it and feeling scred or upset is another. Try to =\r\ndistance yourself from \n&gt; it and think of god.\n&gt; \n&gt; Every experiences, plea=\r\nsurable or painful, will eventually pass away. \n&gt; Instead of focusing the m=\r\nind on the passing clouds, one needs to learn \n&gt; to focus it on the sky beh=\r\nind the clouds. That alone is a constant. \n&gt; Clouds do not stay forever.\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n\n\n\n"}}
