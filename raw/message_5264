A deity, any deity, has a birds eye view of the \nkarmic links =\r\nin any particular situation and know what needs to be done, based \non the s=\r\npecific karmas of the specifc persons interacting at that time. When the \nd=\r\neity is an ugra devata, his/her action may not be gentle, but it always has=\r\n \nsome higher purpose. \n\n\nFor example as Vimalananda mentions, the curse of=\r\n Rishi is always benefitial. \nEven if it puts a person through some discomf=\r\nort, it eventually helps the person \nto come out spiritually stronger. And =\r\nadded to this, if we understand that death \nis merely a comma, and one keep=\r\ns continuing his spiritual journey, then there is \nno confusion at all. In =\r\nmy understanding, same applies to deities as well. Thus \nwhat Vimalananda d=\r\nid and its consequences cannot be correctly judged and/or \nunderstood by=C2=\r\n=A0an average mind like ours. \n\n\nThus is most occasions it not Vimalananda =\r\nthe man who operated, but Smashan \nTaara who did. The marvel of Vimalananda=\r\n is that he had been able to remove his \nI-ness and let Smashan Taara work =\r\nthrough him. She knows what karmas are pilling \nup for whom in what situati=\r\non, and does appropiately. \n\n\nTo achieve a state where the deity remians wi=\r\nth one always, one must remove his \nsense of I completely through teevra sa=\r\ndhana.=C2=A0 Then the deity can fill a \nperson&#39;s consciousness and remain w=\r\nith him 24/7. In that case anything he/she \ndoes is no more done from a sen=\r\nse of I am doing anything, but of he/she - deity \n-=C2=A0doing it. The acti=\r\nons, need not necessarily be as we expect by our normal \nmind. Neither is i=\r\nt always happy and nice. But it always has a higher purpose \nfor the people=\r\n involved, irrespective of whether they understand the same at \nthat moment=\r\n or not.\n\nA child who has a dog bite needs to take anti rabies injections. =\r\nHe may not like \nthe pain of the injection and wonder why that maybe necess=\r\nary at all. But the \ndoctor knows the risks and fatal consequences when not=\r\n given the injection \n(immediate pain). Same way a deity knows what and how=\r\n a person can be made \nbetter even if that may require an immediate pain, m=\r\nental or physical.\n\n-Regards\n=C2=A0Rajarshi\n\n\n\n\n\n__________________________=\r\n______\nFrom: Bhupendra Jamnadas &lt;b_jamnadas@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yaho=\r\nogroups.com\nSent: Fri, 19 November, 2010 12:06:22 AM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wi=\r\nsdom] On Ego (Re: Success with Mantras)\n\n=C2=A0 \nNamaste Atul Ji,\n\nVimalana=\r\nnda certainly seems like a cool person when we read about him but to say \nt=\r\nhat sometimes he was irritated when he felt that his student did not learn =\r\nwell \nis an understatement.

( or nadis - sorry if i am choosing bad words) if those channels are =\r\nnot clean then that energy flow can create unpleasant experiences like incr=\r\neased anger, lust etc. and opposite if channels are clean enough.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Ri=\r\nshis have clean channels and they flow along with divine will. curses and b=\r\nlessings they give are just part of divine will. like curse given to lord v=\r\nishnu by sage narda which led to ramayana. similarly curses given to yadav =\r\nvansh and king prikshit played an important role. vimlananda was a cool guy=\r\n except few times when he was markedly irritated.Like in\n an incidence wher=\r\ne one of his female disciple tried to illude him by coming almost naked in =\r\nfront of him to learn how to become a bhairavi. he was irritated because he=\r\n felt that his student did not learnt well what he taught to her. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;O=\r\nn other side people with some impurities like i-ness and pride may not be a=\r\nble to handle that energy well. and can experience increased anger lust etc=\r\n. like ravana and sadhaka u are mentioning. Although i personally believe t=\r\nhat this is also part of divine will. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please forgive me for my mist=\r\nakes&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards&lt;BR&gt;Atul&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/P&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nSTYLE type=3Dtext/css&gt;\n&lt;!--\n#ygrp-mkp {\nborder:1px solid #d8d8d8;font-famil=\r\ny:Arial;margin:10px 0;padding:0 10px;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp hr {\nborder:1px solid #d8=\r\nd8d8;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #hd {\ncolor:#628c2a;font-size:85%;font-weight:700;line-he=\r\night:122%;margin:10px 0;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp #ads {\nmargin-bottom:10px;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp=\r\n .ad {\npadding:0 0;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad p {\nmargin:0;}\n\n#ygrp-mkp .ad a {\ncolor=\r\n:#0000ff;text-decoration:none;}\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc {\nfont-family:Arial;=\r\n}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc #hd {\nmargin:10px 0px;font-weight:700;font-size:7=\r\n8%;line-height:122%;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ygrp-lc .ad {\nmargin-bottom:10px;padd=\r\ning:0 0;}\n\na {\ncolor:#1e66ae;}\n\n#actions {\nfont-family:Verdana;font-size:11=\r\npx;padding:10px 0;}\n\n#activity {\nbackground-color:#e0ecee;float:left;font-f=\r\namily:Verdana;font-size:10px;padding:10px;}\n\n#activity span {\nfont-weight:7=\r\n00;}\n\n#activity span:first-child {\ntext-transform:uppercase;}\n\n#activity sp=\r\nan a {\ncolor:#5085b6;text-decoration:none;}\n\n#activity span span {\ncolor:#f=\r\nf7900;}\n\n#activity span .underline {\ntext-decoration:underline;}\n\n.attach {=\r\n\nclear:both;display:table;font-family:Arial;font-size:12px;padding:10px 0;w=\r\nidth:400px;}\n\n.attach div a {\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\n.attach img {\nborder:=\r\nnone;padding-right:5px;}\n\n.attach label {\ndisplay:block;margin-bottom:5px;}=\r\n\n\n.attach label a {\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\nblockquote {\nmargin:0 0 0 4px;}=\r\n\n\n.bold {\nfont-family:Arial;font-size:13px;font-weight:700;}\n\n.bold a {\ntex=\r\nt-decoration:none;}\n\ndd.last p a {\nfont-family:Verdana;font-weight:700;}\n\nd=\r\nd.last p span {\nmargin-right:10px;font-family:Verdana;font-weight:700;}\n\ndd=\r\n.last p span.yshortcuts {\nmargin-right:0;}\n\ndiv.attach-table div div a {\nte=\r\nxt-decoration:none;}\n\ndiv.attach-table {\nwidth:400px;}\n\ndiv.file-title a, d=\r\niv.file-title a:active, div.file-title a:hover, div.file-title a:visited {\n=\r\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\ndiv.photo-title a, div.photo-title a:active, div.ph=\r\noto-title a:hover, div.photo-title a:visited {\ntext-decoration:none;}\n\ndiv#=\r\nygrp-mlmsg #ygrp-msg p a span.yshortcuts {\nfont-family:Verdana;font-size:10=\r\npx;font-weight:normal;}\n\n.green {\ncolor:#628c2a;}\n\n.MsoNormal {\nmargin:0 0 =\r\n0 0;}\n\no {\nfont-size:0;}\n\n#photos div {\nfloat:left;width:72px;}\n\n#photos di=\r\nv div {\nborder:1px solid #666666;height:62px;overflow:hidden;width:62px;}\n\n=\r\n#photos div label {\ncolor:#666666;font-size:10px;overflow:hidden;text-align=\r\n:center;white-space:nowrap;width:64px;}\n\n#reco-category {\nfont-size:77%;}\n\n=\r\n#reco-desc {\nfont-size:77%;}\n\n.replbq {\nmargin:4px;}\n\n#ygrp-actbar div a:fi=\r\nrst-child {\nmargin-right:2px;padding-right:5px;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg {\nfont-size:1=\r\n3px;font-family:Arial, helvetica, clean, sans-serif;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg table {\n=\r\nfont-size:inherit;font:100%;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg select, input, textarea {\nfont:9=\r\n9% Arial, Helvetica, clean, sans-serif;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg pre, code {\nfont:115%=\r\n monospace;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg * {\nline-height:1.22em;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg #logo {\npad=\r\nding-bottom:10px;}\n\n#ygrp-mlmsg a {\ncolor:#1E66AE;}\n\n#ygrp-msg p a {\nfont-f=\r\namily:Verdana;}\n\n#ygrp-msg p#attach-count span {\ncolor:#1E66AE;font-weight:=\r\n700;}\n\n#ygrp-reco #reco-head {\ncolor:#ff7900;font-weight:700;}\n\n#ygrp-reco =\r\n{\nmargin-bottom:20px;padding:0px;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov li a {\nfont-size:130%=\r\n;text-decoration:none;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov li {\nfont-size:77%;list-style-ty=\r\npe:square;padding:6px 0;}\n\n#ygrp-sponsor #ov ul {\nmargin:0;padding:0 0 0 8p=\r\nx;}\n\n#ygrp-text {\nfont-family:Georgia;}\n\n#ygrp-text p {\nmargin:0 0 1em 0;}\n=\r\n\n#ygrp-text tt {\nfont-size:120%;}\n\n#ygrp-vital ul li:last-child {\nborder-ri=\r\nght:none !important;\n}\n--&gt;\n&lt;/STYLE&gt;\n&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/body&gt;&lt;/html&gt;\r\n--0-528273513-1290113724=:79735--\r\n\n"}}
