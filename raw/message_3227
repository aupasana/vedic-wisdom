My onl=\r\ny point in\nVegterianism is related to Compession against cruelty. Dharma (N=\r\non Violence)\nagainst Adharama (Killing Innocent creatures).\n***\nAnyway, my =\r\npoint is, I understand that it is good to eat totally vegetarian food when =\r\nyou engage in sadhana, specially things like havans, or else it conflicts w=\r\nith your system badly.\nIn my opinion, Saadhana or No Saadhana, if something=\r\n is not correct will remain Incorrect. killing for filling stomach is if No=\r\nt right then for me it&#39;ll remain *Not right in all conditions*. it is a dif=\r\nferent matter, if in future i succumb to challanging conditions and start e=\r\nating meat but even then it&#39;ll not justify and make it proper thing.\n***\nDe=\r\nar Rajarshi, Now i hope you don&#39;t get offended by my message. i apologise i=\r\nn advance for my bluntness.\n your second Para and some writings in your ear=\r\nlier message gives me impression that you are heavily philosophising. Karam=\r\na, Desh/kaal etc... does not appeal me. to be very honest. \nIn my opinon, i=\r\nf one can justify eating popular meat of chicken, etc.. then anything under=\r\n the Sun is eatable.  with that logic, those people who choose to eat Crab,=\r\n Snakes, insects, cocroaches are perfectly alright. even people who have st=\r\narted eating human flesh are also acceptable and not doing anything wrong a=\r\ns per the &#39;their&#39; thinking.\nTo talk about Karma, Conditioning, Culture etc.=\r\n.., and try to make quality judgements by the logic of &#39;Direct killing&#39; and=\r\n &#39;eating meat of already dead&#39; does not go well with me. it is just a philo=\r\nsophy to cover up.\nPoeple born in Those cultures have become Vegetarian bec=\r\nuase they hate killing invloved. I gave an example of one such person and t=\r\nhere are few more i know. howvever they are very very very rare.\n***\nThe ab=\r\nove arguments are incorrect. I know some non-vegetarian people who provide =\r\nsuch arguements,  but these arguments are nonsensical and childish. Almost =\r\nZakir Naik style of arguments.\n I agree completely. it is childish, Laughab=\r\nle and cruel jokes. Thats how i also take it when such people talk such non=\r\nsense.\n***\nLastly, i&#39;ll add a philospohical thought. If so much of killing =\r\nevery hourly basis, mostly for the sole purpose of *Craving* goes on in the=\r\n world, and the prime mover is Human society, then how we hope to have a pe=\r\nacefull world without blood shed and massacare. unfailing law of Karma (Cau=\r\nse & effect) will find many ways to give it back to (in)Human societies.\nOm=\r\n Shaanti Shaanti Shaanti:\nWarm Regards,\nUtpal \n \n \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ ya=\r\nhoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@. ..&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Utpal,\n&gt; =\r\n=C3=82 \n&gt; I hope you or others won&#39;t get offended by my mails. Please take =\r\nthem in the right vein. I am merely discussing. Now some points:\n&gt; =C3=82 \n=\r\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; But I have often feel that they are themselves are not convince=\r\nd when they argue. they are &#39;hollow&#39; arguments. However , I&#39;ll honestly say=\r\n that i have no answers for &#39;life in a Plant&#39;.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I used to eat non-=\r\nvegetarian food many of my friends who were=C3=82 vegetarian people would g=\r\nive me a similar logic, as you mentioned in your first writing. My point is=\r\n, as a non-vegetarian I am not claiming that I have any special sensitivity=\r\n to plants, over animals. No. All I am saying is that,=C3=82  this logic th=\r\nat many vegetarian people provide to convince average non-veg people to qui=\r\nt eating non-veg, does not hold good.\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; I personally can not look=\r\n at butchery shops where one finds hanging goats. its pathetic site. People=\r\n in their excitements stand in queue to see the cutting of throat of a chic=\r\nken and then take away that as parcel. The flash of so cruelly butchered Ch=\r\nicken or a Goat or a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that they just =\r\noverlook the voice of their inner self. a fish which comes out of water is =\r\nsuch a disturbing site. Panting for water (i don&#39;t have proper English word=\r\n to describe the condition of a fish out of water). and then the dead fish =\r\nthus is so tasty.\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; I understand and appreciate you fee=\r\nlings, but I personally do not share them. Call me cruel hearted. \n&gt; =C3=82=\r\n \n&gt; When the question of sensitivity comes in, there is no universal standa=\r\nrd for such. It is moslty a case of conditioning. What one feels disgusted =\r\nor pained about may not affect another. Same rule cannot be used to judge e=\r\nveryone.=C3=82  \n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; Some of my non-vegetarian friends were watchin=\r\ng discovery channel where they showed that people in some parts of the worl=\r\nd eat insects. My friends seemed disgusted. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you ca=\r\nn eat a chicken or a fish, what is wrong=C3=82 if someone eats an insect. J=\r\nust because one is born in a certain area in a certain culture in a certain=\r\n set of value, one gets the believe that what one is not accustomed to must=\r\n be incorrect. I told them if in a future life time they were to be born in=\r\n that place, they would gladly keep eating insects without the slightest do=\r\nubt in their mind. We humans are incorrigible product of our own conditions=\r\n which in my opinion is all right. BUT the problem happens when we think ou=\r\nr conditions are the only possible conditioning in the world, and therefore=\r\n we wonder why don&#39;t others share similar ideas. That is incorrect. Nature =\r\nhas created the world diverse, and so it is. Everything is desh-kaal-patra.=\r\n A person who is a\n&gt; vegetarian in this life, if he gets born in a place/cu=\r\nlture/ family in a later lifetime which=C3=82 eats non-vegetarian food, he =\r\nwould not even bat an eye lid while eating the same. I know=C3=82 people wh=\r\no faint at the sight of blood, but there are doctors who do multiple operat=\r\nions daily. So my point is, personal sensitivity can be a very good reason =\r\nfor an individual, but it=C3=82 cannot be=C3=82 a universal logic applicabl=\r\ne to all.\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; A far better angle of tackling this is the idea of ka=\r\nrma. Even then, if someone can make sure he is not directly killing an anim=\r\nal, not selecting a live animal to be killed, but rather buys dead meat/fis=\r\nh/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily. Further, if someone (a no=\r\nn-vegetarian)=C3=82 does not want to deal in the raw flesh, he can buy some=\r\n cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of karma that you would get for it =\r\nis quite acceptble IMO. It can be easily handled.=C3=82 It is similar to th=\r\ne one you would get for buying some simple daal which has come to the marke=\r\nt through the hands of a middle man who has cheated the farmer, or God know=\r\ns what else. There is karmic repurcussions in all food we eat in this age. =\r\nIt is unavoidable. There are some eggs - broiler eggs - which never hatch i=\r\nnto eggs. They are designed to be eaten because they never grow into an ani=\r\nmal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What karma does one get for consuming tha=\r\nt? God knows.\n&gt; =C3=82 \n&gt; An average non-vegetarian, at least in India, to =\r\nbe precise is actually an omnivorous. His staple diet consists of 80 percen=\r\nt vegetables/pulses etc and 20 percent non-veg. From a scientific point of =\r\nview, this is a good combination. People who feed on more than 60 percent n=\r\non-veg food in their staple diet, are prone to serious heath issues at a yo=\r\nunger age.

My point is, as a non-vegetarian I am not claiming t=\r\nhat I have any special sensitivity to plants, over animals. No. All I am sa=\r\nying is that,=C3=82&nbsp; this logic that many vegetarian people provide to=\r\n convince average non-veg people to quit eating non-veg, does not hold good=\r\n.&lt;br&gt;&gt;\n =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; I personally can not look at butchery shops=\r\n where one finds hanging goats. its pathetic site. People in their exciteme=\r\nnts stand in queue to see the cutting of throat of a chicken and then take =\r\naway that as parcel. The flash of so cruelly butchered Chicken or a Goat or=\r\n a cow or pig, is so tasty for the humans that they just overlook the voice=\r\n of their inner self. a fish which comes out of water is such a disturbing =\r\nsite. Panting for water (i don&#39;t have proper English word to describe the c=\r\nondition of a fish out of water). and then the dead fish thus is so tasty.&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; I understand and apprecia=\r\nte you feelings, but I personally do not share them. Call me cruel hearted.=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; When the question of sensitivity comes in, t=\r\nhere is no universal standard for such. It is moslty a case of conditioning=\r\n. What one feels disgusted or pained about may not affect another. Same rul=\r\ne cannot be used to\n judge everyone.=C3=82&nbsp; &lt;br&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; Some of my non-vegetarian friends were watching discovery channel where=\r\n they showed that people in some parts of the world eat insects. My friends=\r\n seemed disgusted. I asked them, &quot;Why?&quot;. If you can eat a chicken or a fish=\r\n, what is wrong=C3=82&nbsp;if someone eats an insect. Just because one is b=\r\norn in a certain area in a certain culture in a certain set of value, one g=\r\nets the believe that what one is not accustomed to must be incorrect. I tol=\r\nd them if in a future life time they were to be born in that place, they wo=\r\nuld gladly keep eating insects without the slightest doubt in their mind. W=\r\ne humans are incorrigible product of our own conditions which in my opinion=\r\n is all right. BUT the problem happens when we think our conditions are the=\r\n only possible conditioning in the world, and therefore we wonder why don&#39;t=\r\n others share similar ideas. That is incorrect. Nature has created the worl=\r\nd diverse, and so it is.\n Everything is desh-kaal-patra. A person who is a&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&gt; vegetarian in this life, if he gets born in a place/culture/ family=\r\n in a later lifetime which=C3=82&nbsp;eats non-vegetarian food, he would no=\r\nt even bat an eye lid while eating the same. I know=C3=82&nbsp;people who f=\r\naint at the sight of blood, but there are doctors who do multiple operation=\r\ns daily. So my point is, personal sensitivity can be a very good reason for=\r\n an individual, but it=C3=82&nbsp;cannot be=C3=82&nbsp;a universal logic ap=\r\nplicable to all.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&gt; A far better angle of tacklin=\r\ng this is the idea of karma. Even then, if someone can make sure he is not =\r\ndirectly killing an animal, not selecting a live animal to be killed, but r=\r\nather buys dead meat/fish/egg, the karma generated can be handled easily. F=\r\nurther, if someone (a non-vegetarian)=C3=82&nbsp;does not want to deal in t=\r\nhe raw flesh, he can buy some cooked non-vegetarian food. The amount of kar=\r\nma that you would get for it is quite\n acceptble IMO. It can be easily hand=\r\nled.=C3=82&nbsp;It is similar to the one you would get for buying some simp=\r\nle daal which has come to the market through the hands of a middle man who =\r\nhas cheated the farmer, or God knows what else. There is karmic repurcussio=\r\nns in all food we eat in this age. It is unavoidable. There are some eggs -=\r\n broiler eggs - which never hatch into eggs. They are designed to be eaten =\r\nbecause they never grow into an animal. Alsmot like dead from birth. What k=\r\narma does one get for consuming that? God knows.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; An average non-vegetarian, at least in India, to be precise is actually =\r\nan omnivorous. His staple diet consists of 80 percent vegetables/pulses etc=\r\n and 20 percent non-veg. From a scientific point of view, this is a good co=\r\nmbination. People who feed on more than 60 percent non-veg food in their st=\r\naple diet, are prone to serious heath issues at a younger age.
