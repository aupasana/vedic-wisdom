Care not for doctrines or for dogmas, for sects or for churc=\r\nhes. All these count for but little compared with that essence of existence=\r\n which is in each one, and \n&gt; called &#39;spirituality&#39; . The more this develop=\r\ns in a man, the more powerful is he for good. He who has most of it can do =\r\ngood most to his fellow man. First, then, acquire that. Only those who have=\r\n seen it will understand this; but such spirituality can be given to others=\r\n, even though they be unconscious of the gift. Only those who have attained=\r\n to this power are amongst the great teachers of mankind. They are the powe=\r\nrs of light. Then be you this! The more of such men any country produces, t=\r\nhe higher that country is raised. That land where no such men exist is doom=\r\ned. Nothing can save it. Therefore, my Master&#39;s message to the world is, `B=\r\ne ye all spiritual! Get ye first realization! &#39; And to the young and strong=\r\n of every country he would cry that the time is come for renunciation. &#39;Ren=\r\nounce for the sake of humanity! You have talked of the love of man till the=\r\n thing is in danger of becoming words alone. The time is come to act. The c=\r\nall is now. Do!

Right action varies from person to person, from=\r\n time to time \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and from place to place. It is dependent on what nat=\r\nure expects from you, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; which in turn is based on who you have been =\r\nin the past, what actions you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; did in the past while identifying wi=\r\nth the action, who you affected in the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; past (and how) with the act=\r\nions that you identified with, what debts you \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; created in the proce=\r\nss, and what mental tendencies you accumulated until \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; now.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If, based on one&#39;s mental tendencies and karmic debts, nature want=\r\ns a person \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to kill evil persons, that becomes one&#39;s dharma. If, ba=\r\nsed on one&#39;s mental \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; tendencies and karmic debts, nature wants a pe=\r\nrson to spread the message of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; uniformity of all religions, that be=\r\ncomes one&#39;s dharma.

The time then was such that there was too much weight \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on earth and nature wanted earth to be relieved of some weight. Tre=\r\nmendous \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; destruction was to take place and civilization destroyed t=\r\no a great extent, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to welcome Kali yuga and set the tone for it. Ar=\r\njuna being a great warrior, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it was his dharma to facilitate that. =\r\nSome people he deeply loved and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; respected were on the other side a=\r\nnd it was his dharma to kill them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When the same Arjuna wa=\r\ns born again in the 19th century as one of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa=\r\n&#39; s sishyas (Swami Yogananda had been Arjuna in a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; previous life, a=\r\nccording to Ramakrishna) , his dharma was different in this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; new ti=\r\nme and place.

Valmiki was a shudra who lived by \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; killing birds. He=\r\n became a brahmana and a maharshi later. Vishwamitra was a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kshatri=\r\nta and a powerful king. He became a brahmana and and a maharshi \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; la=\r\nter. Basically varna shows one&#39;s aptitude. One starts off with the varna \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; of father, because that is what one is exposed to in childhood. As o=\r\nne \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; develops in life, one gets one&#39;s own varna based on what one do=\r\nes.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thus, the misinterpretation of Krishna&#39;s words which t=\r\nells you to know your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma from your caste is wrong. Moreover, t=\r\nhere are not just 4 dharmas in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the world. Each person has individu=\r\nal dharma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Knowing what one&#39;s dharma is is very very very =\r\ndifficult. If one is pure \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; enough, one will *know* one&#39;s dharma. In=\r\n fact, all of us have a part of our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mind that tells us what our dh=\r\narma is, but it is surrounded by a lot of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; noise from other parts o=\r\nf our minds which tell other things. Thus, we get \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confused.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We should make the best judgment combining discrimination and in=\r\ntuition and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; decide what is our dharma and follow it sincerely. We =\r\nmay err, but doing \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the best we can is all that we can do!\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; More than following dharma, what is of utmost importance is to eng=\r\nage in \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; actions without identification. *That* alone ensures that w=\r\ne are not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; accumulating new karmas, i.e. not increasing the load. W=\r\ne should not build \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; too much attachment to what we are doing. We sh=\r\nould engage in the best \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; possible actions (based on our best judgme=\r\nnt on what our dharma in the given \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; situation is), with as little a=\r\nttachment and self-identification with the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; action as possible. Whe=\r\nn the action is finished, we should leave the result \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to god. We sh=\r\nould not think &quot;I did it&quot;, &quot;what will happen now&quot;, &quot;will it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; work&quot; =\r\netc. Such adherence of nishkama karma yoga (unfication through \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; una=\r\nttached action) will simplify our ego and purify our consciousness slowly. =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As we become purer, our mind will work sharper and tell our dharma=\r\n clearer. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; There is a positive feedback here. This will slowly enab=\r\nle us to see our \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma clearly and follow it without incurring ne=\r\nw karmas. This is not easy, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; but not as difficult as people think.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The bottomline is: Even if one is not following one&#39;s dhar=\r\nma, one&#39;s sense of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;this is my dharma&quot; gets refined with time if o=\r\nne engages in action with \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; little attachment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *=A0=\r\n=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; In deciding on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma, one&#39;s intellect and intuition are the inputs. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Another =\r\nexternal input is the words of scriptures and learned men. One can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n derive one&#39;s dharma from them. A special place is given to one&#39;s spiritual=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; master. If one surrenders to a spiritual master, one can take the=\r\n words of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; the master to determine one&#39;s dharma and follow it since=\r\nrely.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When Arjuna was confused about what his dharma was a=\r\nnd thought killing gurus \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and relatives was not dharma, he had a gu=\r\nru in Krishna who clarified his \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma. When Narendranath (Swami V=\r\nivekananda) was confused about his dharma \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; and wanted to renounce t=\r\nhe world and go to a secluded place to do sadhana, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Ramakrishna Par=\r\namahamsa cried and prevailed upon him to stay in the material \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; worl=\r\nd and do the work of Mother for him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One who is not in tun=\r\ne with nature and does not know who one is, what one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; debts are a=\r\nnd what nature expects from one can err in the judgment of what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; on=\r\ne&#39;s dharma is. If one&#39;s guru is an elevated soul with a clear insight into =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s inner core, such a guru can give perfect guidance.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Bo=\r\nttomline is that I (or anybody) cannot outline a set of principles and \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; declare that as the dharma. No, dharma changes from person to person, =\r\nfrom \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; time to time and from place to place. Also, there are no thum=\r\nbrules to find \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; out what one&#39;s dharma is. But, one can refine one&#39;s=\r\n understanding of one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; dharma by increasing internal purity. By d=\r\noing various kinds of spiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana (like homam, japam etc) an=\r\nd engaging in actions without much \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; attachment, one can slowly puri=\r\nfy oneself and refine one&#39;s understanding of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; one&#39;s individual dhar=\r\nma.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Sho=\r\nrt Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri =\r\nTarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spiritu=\r\nality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish l=\r\nessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Cent=\r\nre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ----=\r\n- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: &quot;dahiyajiten&quot; &lt;dahiyajiten@ yahoo.c=\r\no. in&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sent: Saturday,=\r\n September 27, 2008 8:02 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Dharma\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Namaste to all\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; i just finished my Aghora series=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and in it in last part\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Vimalanda says path of dharma is =\r\nvery personal.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Can somebody share views on that and how can we app=\r\nroach\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; towards it\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Does it has to do something with vedas a=\r\nnd upanishads\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; jitender\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; From Chandigarh to Chennai - find friends all ove=\r\nr India.

Here we get the rsults.\n\nRegards\nHarikishan. \n\n\n"}}
