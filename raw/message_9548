Is anyone tryin=\r\ng option three? Making everything into sadhana is not easy. A monk at Sivan=\r\nanda Ashram in Rishikesh told me talking to God is also a &#39;meditation&#39;. \n\nS=\r\no if you say, Ok God, let&#39;s go to work, let&#39;s drive, let&#39;s eat a meal, let&#39;=\r\ns repeat your name, let&#39;s discuss all my day-to-day concerns (I need to dis=\r\ncuss them with someone, why not you), I&#39;m doing all these sustained by you.=\r\n..I guess it&#39;s a form of remembrance and hence a kind of meditation.....eve=\r\nn if there are times when you can&#39;t believe with the same conviction that G=\r\nod is listening. It&#39;s a bit disheartening though when it feels like a monol=\r\nogue (I&#39;ve never heard God reply....but I&#39;m probably a bit spiritually deaf=\r\n) and even more disheartening when you sometimes think people would think y=\r\nou&#39;re such an odd person (if they ever found out). \n\nBut as the yogis say, =\r\nyou go to whatever you think of. Think of God and you go to God. So I guess=\r\n it&#39;s worth the incredible  effort it takes (as a beginner) with the whole =\r\nremembrance thing. I&#39;ve thought of setting a watch alarm to go off every ho=\r\nur as a reminder to pause for a couple of minutes to do mental mantra repet=\r\nition (no matter what I&#39;m doing, if possible)- this is a technique to try t=\r\no integrate a bit of japa into my mundane worldly life. (For those of us in=\r\n whom spontaneous love/remembrance is yet to develop, this is probably not =\r\na bad technique). Any one have any other ideas/techniques that they use to =\r\ndevelop the remembrance/make daily activities a sadhana?\n\nAny thoughts/sugg=\r\nestions would be much appreciated.\n\nAparna\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogr=\r\noups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R. Rao&quot; &lt;pvr108@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Durgesh,\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; There is no single answer. We are always pulled in different dire=\r\nctions by different rinas and dharmas. One needs to JUDGE which dharma is h=\r\nigher and which rina is more important.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Depending on one&#39;s in=\r\ndividual circumstances, one of the following may be the best option:\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; (1) Ignore the complaining wife/husband. Don&#39;t fight or argue, but ke=\r\nep doing your sadhana. As time progresses, (a) she may see the positive cha=\r\nnge in your attitude and stop complaining, (b) she may just get used to it =\r\nand accept her fate, (c) she may keep complaining and YOU may get used to t=\r\nhat complaints and accept your fate.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; (2) Talk to her/him and fin=\r\nd some compromise that is acceptable. Instead of doing 1 hour sadhana, may =\r\nbe do half hour and spend more time doing something she likes.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; (=\r\n3) Give up your idea of sadhana and take whatever you are able to do, as sa=\r\nnctioned by your wife/husband, as your sadhana. For example, cooking, clean=\r\ning dishes, washing clothes, taking her to a movie, massaging her feet, tak=\r\ning kids to activities etc can also be sadhanas.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Any activity ca=\r\nn be done with a protesting/dissenting attitudeor an agitated mind, or with=\r\n love and caring and a calm and composed mind. Every activity involves inte=\r\nracting with some objects. Just as god is in idol and fire, he is in vegeta=\r\nbles you cut, food you cook, feet you massage etc. If you see an action as =\r\na chore or look at it or its object(s) with an impure mind (e.g. with lust =\r\nor with anger or with frustration) or focus more of your attention on yours=\r\nelf, then it becomes impure. If you approach the action with a calm and dev=\r\noted mind, see the action and its object(s)with love, devotion and caring a=\r\nnd focus the more of your attention on the action and its objects (rather t=\r\nhan youself and your own happiness), then it becomes a ritual or sadhana.\n&gt;=\r\n =C2=A0\n&gt; Of course, in some actions one hates, it is very difficult to bri=\r\nng that calmness and caring. In some other actions (e.g. sex), one may beco=\r\nme too selfish or self-absorbed and think too much about one&#39;s own sensatio=\r\nns, to look at the action and other persons/objects with love, caring, devo=\r\ntion.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Thus, we normally don&#39;t talk about converting all actio=\r\nns into sadhana and talk about japam, homam etc. It is easier in those to l=\r\nook at the action and its objects with a sense of purity and devotion. Howe=\r\nver, if that is not possible and one has to do some other actions, why note=\r\n TRY to convert them into sadhana? Try to perform the action with a calm, s=\r\ntable, selfless mind, focus attention on the action and its objects and imb=\r\nibe love and caring into your thinking.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n&gt; =C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; In fact, at some stage, (3) has to become part of one&#39;s sadhana. One =\r\nhas to convert every action into a sadhana. Just doing japam or homam for a=\r\nn hour or two may not cut it.\n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; If you live in a really cold count=\r\nry, your room can get very cold. If you turn the heater on for an hour ever=\r\nyday and keep it off rest of the time, the room will overall be very cold. =\r\nSimilarly, if you do sadhana for an hour, you may feel better, but the norm=\r\nal attitude returns. To make permanent progress, the heater has to be on mo=\r\nst of the day! Of course, as you cannot do japam or homam for 12 hours a da=\r\ny, you have to convert whatever you do (eating, driving to work, your work,=\r\n driving back, cooking, eating, talking to people, etc) into sadhana. At so=\r\nme stage, every seeker will have to start doing it.\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; Best rega=\r\nrds,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; --------\n&gt; Astrology & Spirituality Resources: http://ww=\r\nw.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; --------\n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;_____________________=\r\n___________\n&gt; &gt;From: Durgesh Mishra &lt;durgesh.mishra@...&gt;\n&gt; &gt;To: vedic-wisdo=\r\nm@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; &gt;Sent: Tuesday, July 30, 2013 11:43 AM\n&gt; &gt;Subject: [ve=\r\ndic-wisdom] most difficult question\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt;Dear All,\n&gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;If you are interested in spiritual sadhana, dhyaan, homam, fasting=\r\n etc and your spouse doesn&#39;t like you doing it ? then what should you do ?=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;Regards\n&gt; &gt;Durgesh O Mishra\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;-- \n&gt; &gt;&quot;If you onl=\r\ny have a hammer, you tend to see every problem as a nail.&quot; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n=\r\n\n\n\n"}}
