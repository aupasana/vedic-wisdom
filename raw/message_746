THE IMPORTAN=\r\nT \nthing here is that He only indicated me his way of recitation, he \nNEVER=\r\n asked me to do the same way or change the conventional way.\n\nI need to giv=\r\ne one background. for many years i wonder about \n*Mahatmya* in many fo our =\r\nspiriual books. take for instance Gita. it \nis indicated that Gita Mahatmya=\r\n must be recited whenever Gita is \nrecited and without that it&#39;ll not be co=\r\nmplete. Ganapati \nAtharvashirsh also has added protion of the same. Durga S=\r\naptashati \nalso says that if you don&#39;t recite this, this & this then the wh=\r\nole \nchandi paath is like fruitless.\n\ni am not able to reconcile with all t=\r\nhese. IT gives a impression of \ninjecting Fear. It is simply Dogmatic. If y=\r\nou don&#39;t do this then \nyour efforts are wasted but if you do this along wit=\r\nh the main thing \nthen it&#39;ll bring Laddu, Peda, Luxuries, enjoyment of Swar=\r\nga and even \nliberation.\n\nI am at loss to understand these extra things. it=\r\n seems to me that \nit is a Ancient days Marketing gimmick added NOT by the =\r\noriginal \nauthor but some others at later stages. it is quite possible that=\r\n it \nwas introduced everywhere out of good intentions to make people \nrecit=\r\ne it and get benefited. BUT these things have a danger of \ncreating religio=\r\nus Fanatics.\n\nDue to the above written feelings, i welcomed the way of the =\r\nhead \npriest and now i too recite the 13 chapters of Chandi Paath since \nla=\r\nst few recitation. my intentions are to avoid all the added things \nwhich g=\r\nlorifies the Fruits (Tempts us with Great Fruits or \nIntimadate with bad re=\r\nsults)\n\ni think it was off the track.\n\nbefore i finish, must say that the s=\r\nounds with which i do are Aim, \nHreem, Kleem \n\nYours,\n\nutpal\n\n--- In vedic-=\r\nwisdom@ yahoogroups. com, Ashwin Rawal &lt;ashwinrawal@ ...&gt; \nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear =\r\nNarsimhaji\n&gt; 1.Since=C3=82=C2=A0I have joined this group before some couple=\r\n of months, \nsome previous mails I have not read.

However, Manish did not reveal that incident t=\r\no me until much \nlater. All he told me at that time was that Narayan really=\r\n needed to \ndo homam everyday and that I should teach a simple procedure to=\r\n him.\n&gt; \n&gt; I experimented with homam, started doing occasionally and liked =\r\n\nit. I started doing a quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily \nfor =\r\na few months, I finally got down to the original task - teaching \nNarayan. =\r\nI chose to write a detailed manual for that purpose. In \nhindsight, I made =\r\nthe correct choice, as many people in addition to \nNarayan are able to do h=\r\nomam using the manual now! I and many other \npeople have benefited (and wil=\r\nl benefit). However, as far as my mind \nconcerned, all this started for Nar=\r\nayan! When it was time for \nNarayan to start doing homam, many people acros=\r\ns the world started \nwith him. What a fortunate soul..\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; It w=\r\nas probably for a reason that Manish did not tell me at the \nonset itself w=\r\nhat the Mother asked him to do. My attitude and mental \nstate would&#39;ve been=\r\n different while working on the manual. I \nwould&#39;ve been more egoistic and =\r\nalso hurried more. Because the only \nthing I was told was to teach Narayan,=\r\n I took my sweet time, arrived \nat the correct balance and also wrote it do=\r\nwn without many \npretensions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik=\r\n and I \nreally benefited from the exercise. If I had known the full story, =\r\n\nit would have had more rajas given my mental state then and I would \nnot h=\r\nave had made the same progress I made, while preparing myself \nto teach hom=\r\nam to Narayan.\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish told me the full story only when I was better pr=\r\nepared to \nhandle the information and, of course, I added it to the preface=\r\n of \nthe manual as asked by him then.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; A good guru protects =\r\na sishya from unnecessary information that \ncan wreak havoc with the ego. I=\r\n remember another incident.\n&gt; \n&gt; One day in the spring of the same year, I =\r\ndecided to spend a whole \nday meditating with Gayatri mantra during the com=\r\ning weekend. The \ninspiration came out of nowhere and I immediately latched=\r\n on to it. \nWhen I told Manish, he only said &quot;good, go ahead and do it&quot;. I =\r\n\nstarted before sunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 \nbreaks of=\r\n 2 min, a 20 min break at noon for bath and a small lunch \nand another 10 m=\r\nin break for another bath at dusk, I was basically \nsitting in the same pla=\r\nce and meditating with Gayatri mantra. It was \na very good experience. I wa=\r\ns in a very nice state at the end of the \nday.\n&gt; \n&gt; I noticed on the next d=\r\nay that the previous day was Akshaya \nTriteeya (Vaisakha Sukla Triteeya). I=\r\nt is considered a very \nauspicious day and it is believed that spiritual sa=\r\ndhana on that day \nis 1000 times more powerful than on other days. Though I=\r\n had not \nnoticed it before, I picked a perfect day for the sadhana. I was =\r\n\nexcited. When I mentioned this to Manish with excitement a few days \nlater=\r\n, he said calmly &quot;I knew it earlier itself. But I did not tell \nyou because=\r\n knowing it would&#39;ve distracted you. You would have been \nexcited at doing =\r\nthe sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that excitement \nwould&#39;ve changed the m=\r\nental focus and brought more rajas into the \nsadhana.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; He was absolute=\r\nly right. As such, I was &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a \nsadhana. The ego and prid=\r\ne brought rajas and limited the mental \nfocus on the mantra. If I was aware=\r\n that I was doing this sadhana on \na powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased th=\r\ne pride and excitement, \nbrought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on=\r\n mantra further. \nEgo is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes exce=\r\nllent \nprogress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing \nM=\r\nanish&#39;s words, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive \nand ki=\r\ncking and that he was wise not to feed it with more delicious \nfood!\n&gt; \n&gt; L=\r\nucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell them what \nis useful =\r\nrather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have a \nguru (or someone =\r\nelse) who can go to the heart of their problem and \npoint it out, so that t=\r\nhey can weed it out through further \nintrospection and weaken it through co=\r\nnscious effort.\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; I remember one more similar incident. Befor=\r\ne the shata chandi \nhomam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me =\r\nto a Siddha \n(a perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentione=\r\nd the \nname of one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and =\r\n\nthat I would do some important work in this birth.\n&gt; \n&gt; When I saw Manish =\r\nlater that day, I mentioned this to him. He \nimmediately became serious and=\r\n said &quot;Narasimha, do you need one more \nidentity? Your ego is already stron=\r\ng with the identity \nof &#39;Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the =\r\n\nastrologer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the spiritual \nseeker&#39;=\r\n etc. It will take great effort to overcome those identities \nand find True=\r\n Self. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you \nreally need yet anot=\r\nher new identity to feed your ego further? See, \nwhat he said may very well=\r\n be correct. But it is not useful for your \nprogress. You have to rise abov=\r\ne all identities.&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; How true and wise!\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Just as a fat an=\r\nd mighty dog may win over a lean and weak dog and \nget all the food given b=\r\ny the master, ahamkara (ego or the sense \nof &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the s=\r\npirit of detachment and gets all \nthe energy possible. Just as a good maste=\r\nr may chain the fat dog and \nfeed the lean dog specially, we too must consc=\r\niously try to restrain \nego and increase detachment.\n&gt; \n&gt; Manish has a uniq=\r\nue way of looking at things and some simple \npoints he made brought so much=\r\n clarity to my thinking and sped up my \nspiritual evolution in this life. E=\r\nven without giving any specific \nmantra to me, like many spiritual gurus do=\r\n, he lit the lamp of \nknowledge in my heart. He would say the lamp and ligh=\r\nt were already \nthere and he simply wiped the dust on the lamp that was blo=\r\ncking the \nlight. That is what a good guru does. He/She wipes off the thick=\r\n \nlayer of dirt (conditioning by gunas) on the glass (ego) that \nencloses t=\r\nhe lamp (Self) that is lit in the heart. Sometimes, we may \nbe too caught u=\r\np to notice that dirt ourselves..\n&gt; \n&gt; * * *\n&gt; \n&gt; Homam and other spiritual=\r\n sadhana tools are very helpful. But one \nshould also try to introspect and=\r\n change one&#39;s thinking, on an \nongoing basis. There is no magic pill. For m=\r\nost people, this does \nnot take just a single moment or day or month or yea=\r\nr. It CAN take a \nlong time. As Narayan indicated, one should start walking=\r\n on the \npath and not worry about the progress and the distance left. One w=\r\nho \nkeeps walking without distractions will reach the goal.\n&gt; \n&gt; The point =\r\nI want to emphasize is that the external rituals (like \nhomam) and the inte=\r\nrnal introspection (to change attitude) should go \nhand in hand. After a wh=\r\nile, there will be synergy between them and \nthey will start to work togeth=\r\ner very effectively.\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------ --------=\r\n- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: ht=\r\ntp://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://w=\r\nww.VedicAst rologer.org/ \ntarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/=\r\n group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.=\r\ncomcast. net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer=\r\n.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; -=\r\n----------- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; \n&gt; ---- n=\r\naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; Namaste Friends,\n&gt; &gt; \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; Some ramblings ...\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regarding fire getting extinguished (or any=\r\nthing similar to it), \nit\n&gt; &gt; happens with all beginners and its only pract=\r\nice which makes one\n&gt; &gt; perfect.

Imagine!!! In Kaliyuga, a=\r\nlong \nwith\n&gt; &gt; Homa, surrendering to ones chosen deity is the best path for=\r\n \nmost. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Let me share one incident, when Narasimha&#39;s spiritual Gur=\r\nu whom \nI also\n&gt; &gt; consider my Guru, asked me (when we were in Chennai for =\r\nShata \nChandi\n&gt; &gt; Homa) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was reall=\r\ny \njoking!\n&gt; &gt; When I got back to the US, he called me again and reminded m=\r\ne. \nIt then\n&gt; &gt; occured to me he was really being serious. So, I started \ns=\r\nearching on\n&gt; &gt; the net and I found a really flimsy document, but neverthel=\r\ness I \ntook\n&gt; &gt; it up and performed it. But, I was not satisfied. Manishji =\r\nthen\n&gt; &gt; reminded me of the book he gifted me, but even in that it was \nent=\r\nirely\n&gt; &gt; in Samskrit and illiterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish \nbet=\r\nween\n&gt; &gt; an instruction and sloka :). Around this time, Narasimha \noccasion=\r\nally\n&gt; &gt; performed a longer version of the homam and I particpated in it, \n=\r\nbut\n&gt; &gt; never could grasp it. I then asked Narasimha to guide me, which \nhe=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; did, but still it did not get through my really dense brains :). \nI\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; felt really helpless, but the stars were such that I never gave \nup,\n&gt; &gt; =\r\ninstead I made a sincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that If he \nreally\n&gt; &gt; int=\r\nends that I perform the homa, then he should kindly show me \nthe\n&gt; &gt; way. I=\r\nn around two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has \ndecided\n&gt; &gt; to docu=\r\nment the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa. I just \ncouldnt\n&gt; &gt; believe my=\r\n luck and thanked the Elephant-headed omnipotent for \nhis\n&gt; &gt; grace. Well .=\r\n.. its been exactly 2yrs and I am still at it taking\n&gt; &gt; baby-steps and mak=\r\ning progress everyday.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I thank Manishji, Narasimha and the all the=\r\n divine forces for \nhelping\n&gt; &gt; me progress.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; My request, pls dont =\r\ngive it up, persist with it no matter what. \nWe\n&gt; &gt; are humans and prone to=\r\n mistakes. But then nobody got perfect \nthe very\n&gt; &gt; first time, unless he =\r\nhas worked on it a lot in his previous \nlives.\n&gt; &gt; Its all a continuum. Don=\r\nt worry about time, we have future \nlives ...\n&gt; &gt; plenty of time. These thi=\r\nngs take their own sweet time, doesnt \nhappen\n&gt; &gt; overnight. No matter what=\r\n, complete your homa everyday, that \nshould be\n&gt; &gt; the primary goal ... not=\r\nhing else. Pls dont waver from it, \nwhether you\n&gt; &gt; get or dont get anythin=\r\ng. Slowly we&#39;ll progress in our Sadhana \nand\n&gt; &gt; move on to higher things. =\r\nI wish all the best.

Let me give an analogy.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your favorite deity as the master and yourself as a \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; servant. A servant simply serves the master. Similarly, all \nthe \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; sadhana you do and your other activities are your way to serve \nyour \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; master.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy and have ma=\r\nny big checks \n&gt; &gt; &gt; everyday to cash and also many big checks everyday to =\r\nmail \nothers. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet, he may need a servant to physically carry papers =\r\nto the \nbank and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing =\r\nanything in \nthis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; world and yet god needs human beings who execute g=\r\nod&#39;s agenda \nin this \n&gt; &gt; &gt; world. That is why various gods (including Vish=\r\nnu himself) and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming back to earth every now a=\r\nnd then. \nThe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; supreme god of this world operates through various phy=\r\nsical \npersons \n&gt; &gt; &gt; present on earth.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam and ot=\r\nher spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves \nand try \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to help others, bec=\r\nause that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant \ncarries \n&gt; &gt; &gt; master&#39;s papers =\r\nto the bank, we do such work for god.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applau=\r\nded by others as good work tends to \npromote ego \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and we need to guar=\r\nd against it. A servant carrying a million \ndollar \n&gt; &gt; &gt; check to the bank=\r\n and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant \n&gt; &gt; &gt; carrying a $100 check t=\r\no the bank and cashing it. Both are \nmerely \n&gt; &gt; &gt; doing their master&#39;s wor=\r\nk and do not own anything. Both are \njust \n&gt; &gt; &gt; *instruments* used by the =\r\nmaster to carry out his agenda. \nSimilarly, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; one who does what are co=\r\nnsidered great deeds in this world and \none \n&gt; &gt; &gt; who does what are consid=\r\nered meagre deeds in this world are \nboth \n&gt; &gt; &gt; servants of god helping go=\r\nd execute god&#39;s agenda in this \nworld. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything.=\r\n One may consider oneself \nsuperior to \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the other because his/her dee=\r\nds are considered superior by the \nworld, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; but he/she is just as fool=\r\nish as a servant who considers \n&gt; &gt; &gt; himself/herself superior to another s=\r\nervant carrying something \nless \n&gt; &gt; &gt; valuable.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If this a=\r\nttitude of being a servant of god fully penetrates \none&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt; attitude, =\r\nthinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; situations his pr=\r\nevious karmas place one in. One can remain \nhappy and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; blissful in pl=\r\neasure and pain, in praise and criticism and in \nlight \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and darkness.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam.

Can a homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made by arran=\r\nging red bricks, with sand base be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; used instead of a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; coppe=\r\nr one?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you can do it on a rooftop. Doing it in the op=\r\nen is \n&gt; &gt; &gt; actually better than doing it in closed space. But realize \nth=\r\nat a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protect \nth=\r\ne fire \n&gt; &gt; &gt; if it rains while you are doing homam. It is not good if fire=\r\n \nis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; extinguished by rain in the middle of a homam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Yes, you can construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; at the bo=\r\nttom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While performing=\r\n the Homam using the mp3 audio file, \n&gt; &gt; &gt; should one repeat the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n mantras mentally along with the audio?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One can repeat men=\r\ntally while listening attentively (not \n&gt; &gt; &gt; casually). Actually, even lis=\r\ntening to mantras with all the \nattention \n&gt; &gt; &gt; focused is as powerful as =\r\nsaying mantras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose person X is chanting a mantra and =\r\nthinking of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose person Y is lis=\r\ntening \nto it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with focus and thinking of the mantra and its deity. T=\r\nhen the \nmantra \n&gt; &gt; &gt; may do nothing for person X and yet person Y may ben=\r\nefit from \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the =\r\nmind&quot;.. \nOne can \n&gt; &gt; &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected=\r\n. The key \nis \n&gt; &gt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the mind focused on =\r\nthe \nmantra.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; However, there is a difference between medita=\r\ntion and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditati=\r\non \nand it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So =\r\n\nmaking some \n&gt; &gt; &gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a good idea as oppos=\r\ned to \nsilent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; chanting or just listening. Try to repeat slowly.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other \n&gt; &gt; &gt; con=\r\nditions/niyamas that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be followed apart from having vegeter=\r\nain food?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread cer=\r\nemony) \n&gt; &gt; &gt; has been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is \nirrelev=\r\nant.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One should follow the yamas and niyamas set by one&#39;s =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets, one should follow them \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nstrictly. At the minimum, one should eat only vegetarian food \non the \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; day of homam and take a bath before homam. Another rule I will \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rec=\r\nommend is to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before \nhomam.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thread wants to do \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homam f=\r\nor spiritual progress, I am willing to take \nresponsibility and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; allo=\r\nw them to do it. Such a person can think of me or my guru \nas guru \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nnd perform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred \nin the \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n process until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of \npurity \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n through homam and other spiritual practices. Sacred thread or \nno \n&gt; &gt; &gt; s=\r\nacred thread, mantropadesa or no mantropadesa, it does not \nmatter \n&gt; &gt; &gt; a=\r\nfter a while, when the person crosses a threshhold of purity. \nThe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; g=\r\noal of upanayanam and other mantropadesa by guru is to speed \nthis up \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; and make the person cross the threshhold of purity.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; As l=\r\nong as one desires no specific material benefits (and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; ready to recei=\r\nve whatever god gives) and does homam for \nspiritual \n&gt; &gt; &gt; progress, I am =\r\nwilling to help, even if it means some \nsuffering for \n&gt; &gt; &gt; me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 4)Any good date to start the Homam? or any day would be \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fin=\r\ne?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For Mahaganapathi homam, the best is a Chaturthi mornin=\r\ng. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; But any day is fine really.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; Mentioning rain and rooftop homam reminded me of my India \n&gt; &gt; &gt; trip.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; When I went to India in May 2008, I and my guru Manish \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; traveled together to several places (on a specific project). \nWe ended \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; up doing homam in the morning in several places (wherever we \nwere). =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Before the trip, my guru told me to carry an umbrella with me. \nAs \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; monsoons come only in June/July in India, I did not take it \n&gt; &gt; &gt; se=\r\nriously. We were in New Delhi in mid-May.. We proceeded to \nthe \n&gt; &gt; &gt; roof=\r\ntop of the apartment complex we were in, to do a homam. \nManish \n&gt; &gt; &gt; told=\r\n me, &quot;Narasimha, it is going to rain heavily in this city \nafter \n&gt; &gt; &gt; our=\r\n homam finishes&quot;. I just smiled.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To my surprise, it did ra=\r\nin as soon as our homas \n&gt; &gt; &gt; finished. After we offered poornaahuti, it s=\r\nuddenly started \nraining \n&gt; &gt; &gt; with really big drops. Luckily, there was a=\r\n small \ntowel/blanket on \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the rooftop close to us. Together, we held =\r\nit on top of the \ntwo small \n&gt; &gt; &gt; homa kundas, closed our eyes and meditat=\r\ned. We held the cloth \ncover \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on the homa kundas until fire in the tw=\r\no homa kundas went off \nand \n&gt; &gt; &gt; then packed everything and went down. We=\r\n left for Kurukshetra \nlater \n&gt; &gt; &gt; that day, but we were told that a heavy=\r\n rain continued for a \nfew days \n&gt; &gt; &gt; in New Delhi. In fact, rain followed=\r\n us on that trip as we \ncovered \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the north, east and west of India. I=\r\nt rained in every place we \nwent \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to, as we finished our task in that=\r\n place and prepared to move \non.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Nar=\r\nasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; r=\r\nologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ =\r\ngroup/vedic- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedic=\r\nastro. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; home..comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): h=\r\nttp://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; &gt; rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) we=\r\nbsite: http://www.SriJagan \n&gt; &gt; &gt; nath..org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------- -----\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ---- Phan=\r\nikumar Velaga &lt;itsverysimple@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namasthe,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am interested in doing Maha Ganapati Homam daily, and \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; have few questions\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; regarding it.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1)Can Ho=\r\nmam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-\n&gt; &gt; &gt; floors) ?

I told him tha=\r\nt i &lt;BR&gt;try to follow conventional instructions given in the book i.e 13 &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;chapters with Kavach,Argala, Kilak,Devi &amp; Ratri Sukta, Nyas, 3 &lt;BR&gt;ra=\r\nsyas and Kshma Prarthana at the end.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He told me that he only reads K=\r\navach, Nyasa etc... at the begining &lt;BR&gt;and then continues reciting 13 chap=\r\nters every day. THE IMPORTANT &lt;BR&gt;thing here is that He only indicated me h=\r\nis way of recitation, he &lt;BR&gt;NEVER asked me to do the same way or change th=\r\ne conventional way.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I need to give one background. for many years i =\r\nwonder about &lt;BR&gt;*Mahatmya* in many fo our spiriual books. take for instanc=\r\ne Gita. it &lt;BR&gt;is indicated that Gita Mahatmya must be recited whenever Git=\r\na is &lt;BR&gt;recited and without that it&#39;ll not be complete. Ganapati &lt;BR&gt;Athar=\r\nvashirsh also has added protion of the same.\n Durga Saptashati &lt;BR&gt;also say=\r\ns that if you don&#39;t recite this, this &amp; this then the whole &lt;BR&gt;chandi =\r\npaath is like fruitless.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;i am not able to reconcile with all these. =\r\nIT gives a impression of &lt;BR&gt;injecting Fear. It is simply Dogmatic. If you =\r\ndon&#39;t do this then &lt;BR&gt;your efforts are wasted but if you do this along wit=\r\nh the main thing &lt;BR&gt;then it&#39;ll bring Laddu, Peda, Luxuries, enjoyment of S=\r\nwarga and even &lt;BR&gt;liberation.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am at loss to understand these extr=\r\na things. it seems to me that &lt;BR&gt;it is a Ancient days Marketing gimmick ad=\r\nded NOT by the original &lt;BR&gt;author but some others at later stages. it is q=\r\nuite possible that it &lt;BR&gt;was introduced everywhere out of good intentions =\r\nto make people &lt;BR&gt;recite it and get benefited. BUT these things have a dan=\r\nger of &lt;BR&gt;creating religious Fanatics.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Due to the above written fee=\r\nlings, i welcomed the way of the head &lt;BR&gt;priest and now i too recite the 1=\r\n3 chapters of Chandi Paath since\n &lt;BR&gt;last few recitation. my intentions ar=\r\ne to avoid all the added things &lt;BR&gt;which glorifies the Fruits (Tempts us w=\r\nith Great Fruits or &lt;BR&gt;Intimadate with bad results)&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;i think it was =\r\noff the track.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;before i finish, must say that the sounds with which =\r\ni do are Aim, &lt;BR&gt;Hreem, Kleem &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Yours,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;utpal&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A=\r\n href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofol=\r\nlow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, Ashwin Rawal &lt;ashwinrawal@ ...&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dear Narsimhaji&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1.Since=C3=82&nbsp;I =\r\nhave joined this group before some couple of months, &lt;BR&gt;some previous mail=\r\ns I have not read.

However,=\r\n Manish did not reveal that incident to me until much &lt;BR&gt;later. All he tol=\r\nd me at that time was that Narayan really needed to &lt;BR&gt;do homam everyday a=\r\nnd that I should teach a simple procedure to him.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I experi=\r\nmented with homam, started doing occasionally and liked &lt;BR&gt;it. I started d=\r\noing a quick procedure everyday. After doing it daily &lt;BR&gt;for a few months,=\r\n I finally got down to the original task - teaching &lt;BR&gt;Narayan. I chose to=\r\n write a detailed manual for that purpose. In &lt;BR&gt;hindsight, I made the cor=\r\nrect choice, as many people in addition to &lt;BR&gt;Narayan are able to do homam=\r\n using the manual now! I and\n many other &lt;BR&gt;people have benefited (and wil=\r\nl benefit). However, as far as my mind &lt;BR&gt;concerned, all this started for =\r\nNarayan! When it was time for &lt;BR&gt;Narayan to start doing homam, many people=\r\n across the world started &lt;BR&gt;with him. What a fortunate soul..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It was probably for a reason that Manish did n=\r\not tell me at the &lt;BR&gt;onset itself what the Mother asked him to do. My atti=\r\ntude and mental &lt;BR&gt;state would&#39;ve been different while working on the manu=\r\nal. I &lt;BR&gt;would&#39;ve been more egoistic and also hurried more. Because the on=\r\nly &lt;BR&gt;thing I was told was to teach Narayan, I took my sweet time, arrived=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;at the correct balance and also wrote it down without many &lt;BR&gt;pretens=\r\nions. The whole effort ended up being more saattwik and I &lt;BR&gt;really benefi=\r\nted from the exercise. If I had known the full story, &lt;BR&gt;it would have had=\r\n more rajas given my mental state then and I would &lt;BR&gt;not have had made th=\r\ne same progress I\n made, while preparing myself &lt;BR&gt;to teach homam to Naray=\r\nan.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Manish told me the full story only when I was better p=\r\nrepared to &lt;BR&gt;handle the information and, of course, I added it to the pre=\r\nface of &lt;BR&gt;the manual as asked by him then.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; A good guru protects a sishya from unnecessary information that &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;can wreak havoc with the ego. I remember another incident.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; One day in the spring of the same year, I decided to spend a whole &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nday meditating with Gayatri mantra during the coming weekend. The &lt;BR&gt;inspi=\r\nration came out of nowhere and I immediately latched on to it. &lt;BR&gt;When I t=\r\nold Manish, he only said &quot;good, go ahead and do it&quot;. I &lt;BR&gt;started before s=\r\nunrise and went on till 9:30 pm. Except for 3-4 &lt;BR&gt;breaks of 2 min, a 20 m=\r\nin break at noon for bath and a small lunch &lt;BR&gt;and another 10 min break fo=\r\nr another bath at dusk, I was basically &lt;BR&gt;sitting in the same place and m=\r\neditating\n with Gayatri mantra. It was &lt;BR&gt;a very good experience. I was in=\r\n a very nice state at the end of the &lt;BR&gt;day.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I noticed on=\r\n the next day that the previous day was Akshaya &lt;BR&gt;Triteeya (Vaisakha Sukl=\r\na Triteeya). It is considered a very &lt;BR&gt;auspicious day and it is believed =\r\nthat spiritual sadhana on that day &lt;BR&gt;is 1000 times more powerful than on =\r\nother days. Though I had not &lt;BR&gt;noticed it before, I picked a perfect day =\r\nfor the sadhana. I was &lt;BR&gt;excited. When I mentioned this to Manish with ex=\r\ncitement a few days &lt;BR&gt;later, he said calmly &quot;I knew it earlier itself. Bu=\r\nt I did not tell &lt;BR&gt;you because knowing it would&#39;ve distracted you. You wo=\r\nuld have been &lt;BR&gt;excited at doing the sadhana on Akshaya Triteeya and that=\r\n excitement &lt;BR&gt;would&#39;ve changed the mental focus and brought more rajas in=\r\nto the &lt;BR&gt;sadhana.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He was absolutely right. As such, I w=\r\nas &quot;proud&quot; of doing such a &lt;BR&gt;sadhana. The ego and pride brought rajas and=\r\n\n limited the mental &lt;BR&gt;focus on the mantra. If I was aware that I was doi=\r\nng this sadhana on &lt;BR&gt;a powerful day, it would&#39;ve increased the pride and =\r\nexcitement, &lt;BR&gt;brought in rajas and reduced the saattwik focus on mantra f=\r\nurther. &lt;BR&gt;Ego is a very dangerous entity. Even after one makes excellent =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;progress, it can suddenly return and pull one down! After hearing &lt;BR&gt;M=\r\nanish&#39;s words, I introspected and found that my ego was still alive &lt;BR&gt;and=\r\n kicking and that he was wise not to feed it with more delicious &lt;BR&gt;food!&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Lucky are those who have a guru who can succintly tell the=\r\nm what &lt;BR&gt;is useful rather than what sounds good. Lucky are those who have=\r\n a &lt;BR&gt;guru (or someone else) who can go to the heart of their problem and =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;point it out, so that they can weed it out through further &lt;BR&gt;introspe=\r\nction and weaken it through conscious effort.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I remember one more similar incident. Before the shata\n chandi &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;homam in early 2006, a priest we respect a lot took me to a Siddha &lt;BR&gt;(=\r\na perfected/advanced soul). When he looked at me, he mentioned the &lt;BR&gt;name=\r\n of one of the saptarshis and said that I very close to him and &lt;BR&gt;that I =\r\nwould do some important work in this birth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When I saw Man=\r\nish later that day, I mentioned this to him. He &lt;BR&gt;immediately became seri=\r\nous and said &quot;Narasimha, do you need one more &lt;BR&gt;identity? Your ego is alr=\r\neady strong with the identity &lt;BR&gt;of &#39;Narasimha, the Sanskrit scholar&#39;, &#39;Na=\r\nrasimha, the &lt;BR&gt;astrologer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the engineer&#39;, &#39;Narasimha, the sp=\r\niritual &lt;BR&gt;seeker&#39; etc. It will take great effort to overcome those identi=\r\nties &lt;BR&gt;and find True Self. As if that challenge is not sufficient, do you=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;really need yet another new identity to feed your ego further? See, &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;what he said may very well be correct. But it is not useful for your &lt;BR&gt;=\r\nprogress. You have to rise above all identities.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; How tru=\r\ne and wise!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Just as a fat and might=\r\ny dog may win over a lean and weak dog and &lt;BR&gt;get all the food given by th=\r\ne master, ahamkara (ego or the sense &lt;BR&gt;of &quot;I&quot;) within us wins over the sp=\r\nirit of detachment and gets all &lt;BR&gt;the energy possible. Just as a good mas=\r\nter may chain the fat dog and &lt;BR&gt;feed the lean dog specially, we too must =\r\nconsciously try to restrain &lt;BR&gt;ego and increase detachment.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; Manish has a unique way of looking at things and some simple &lt;BR&gt;points =\r\nhe made brought so much clarity to my thinking and sped up my &lt;BR&gt;spiritual=\r\n evolution in this life. Even without giving any specific &lt;BR&gt;mantra to me,=\r\n like many spiritual gurus do, he lit the lamp of &lt;BR&gt;knowledge in my heart=\r\n. He would say the lamp and light were already &lt;BR&gt;there and he simply wipe=\r\nd the dust on the lamp that was blocking the &lt;BR&gt;light. That is what a good=\r\n guru does. He/She wipes off the thick &lt;BR&gt;layer of\n dirt (conditioning by =\r\ngunas) on the glass (ego) that &lt;BR&gt;encloses the lamp (Self) that is lit in =\r\nthe heart. Sometimes, we may &lt;BR&gt;be too caught up to notice that dirt ourse=\r\nlves..&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Homam and other spiritual sa=\r\ndhana tools are very helpful. But one &lt;BR&gt;should also try to introspect and=\r\n change one&#39;s thinking, on an &lt;BR&gt;ongoing basis. There is no magic pill. Fo=\r\nr most people, this does &lt;BR&gt;not take just a single moment or day or month =\r\nor year. It CAN take a &lt;BR&gt;long time. As Narayan indicated, one should star=\r\nt walking on the &lt;BR&gt;path and not worry about the progress and the distance=\r\n left. One who &lt;BR&gt;keeps walking without distractions will reach the goal.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The point I want to emphasize is that the external rituals=\r\n (like &lt;BR&gt;homam) and the internal introspection (to change attitude) shoul=\r\nd go &lt;BR&gt;hand in hand. After a while, there will be synergy between them an=\r\nd &lt;BR&gt;they will start to work together very\n effectively.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nBest regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --=\r\n------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/=\r\nA&gt; rologer.org/ homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http:/=\r\n/www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rolo=\r\nger.org/ &lt;BR&gt;tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; targ=\r\net=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdo=\r\nm&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D=\r\n_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri Jagan=\r\nnath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_blank=\r\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; ------------\n ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ---- naara=\r\nayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&gt; wrote: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste Fri=\r\nends,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Some ramblings ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; Regarding fire getting extinguished (or anything similar to it), &lt;BR&gt;it=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; happens with all beginners and its only practice which makes =\r\none&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; perfect.

Imag=\r\nine!!! In Kaliyuga, along &lt;BR&gt;with&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Homa, surrendering to ones =\r\nchosen deity is the best path for &lt;BR&gt;most. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Let=\r\n me share one incident, when Narasimha&#39;s spiritual Guru whom &lt;BR&gt;I also&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; consider my Guru, asked me (when we were in Chennai for Shata &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;Chandi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Homa) to learn Mahaganapthi homam, I thought he was re=\r\nally &lt;BR&gt;joking!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; When I got back to the US, he called me again=\r\n and reminded me. &lt;BR&gt;It then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; occured to me he was really bein=\r\ng serious. So, I started &lt;BR&gt;searching on&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; the net and I found =\r\na really flimsy document, but nevertheless I &lt;BR&gt;took&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; it up an=\r\nd performed it. But, I was not satisfied. Manishji then&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; remind=\r\ned me of the book he gifted me, but even in that it\n was &lt;BR&gt;entirely&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; in Samskrit and illiterate that I am, I couldn&#39;t distinguish &lt;BR&gt;be=\r\ntween&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; an instruction and sloka :). Around this time, Narasimha=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;occasionally&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; performed a longer version of the homam and =\r\nI particpated in it, &lt;BR&gt;but&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; never could grasp it. I then aske=\r\nd Narasimha to guide me, which &lt;BR&gt;he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; did, but still it did no=\r\nt get through my really dense brains :). &lt;BR&gt;I&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; felt really hel=\r\npless, but the stars were such that I never gave &lt;BR&gt;up,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; inste=\r\nad I made a sincere prayer to Lord Ganesha, that If he &lt;BR&gt;really&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; intends that I perform the homa, then he should kindly show me &lt;BR&gt;the&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; way. In around two weeks time, Narasimha told me that he has &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;decided&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; to document the Laghu (Short) paddhati of the homa.=\r\n I just &lt;BR&gt;couldnt&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; believe my luck and thanked the Elephant-h=\r\neaded omnipotent for &lt;BR&gt;his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n grace. Well ... its been exactly=\r\n 2yrs and I am still at it taking&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; baby-steps and making progre=\r\nss everyday.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I thank Manishji, Narasimha and the=\r\n all the divine forces for &lt;BR&gt;helping&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; me progress.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; My request, pls dont give it up, persist with it no matter=\r\n what. &lt;BR&gt;We&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; are humans and prone to mistakes. But then nobod=\r\ny got perfect &lt;BR&gt;the very&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; first time, unless he has worked on=\r\n it a lot in his previous &lt;BR&gt;lives.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Its all a continuum. Dont=\r\n worry about time, we have future &lt;BR&gt;lives ...&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; plenty of time=\r\n. These things take their own sweet time, doesnt &lt;BR&gt;happen&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; ov=\r\nernight. No matter what, complete your homa everyday, that &lt;BR&gt;should be&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the primary goal ... nothing else. Pls dont waver from it, &lt;BR&gt;w=\r\nhether you&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; get or dont get anything. Slowly we&#39;ll progress in =\r\nour Sadhana &lt;BR&gt;and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;\n move on to higher things. I wish all the =\r\nbest. We should really &lt;BR&gt;thank&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; our stars that people like Ma=\r\nnishji and Narasimhaji are here &lt;BR&gt;guiding&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; us ... what would =\r\nbe life without them!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks for listening.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -Narayan-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Garu !!!&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;A serva=\r\nnt carrying a million dollar check to the bank and &lt;BR&gt;cashing it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;is NOT superior to a servant carrying a $100 check to the &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;bank and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;cashing it.

Let me give an analogy.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Think of your favorite deity as the master and your=\r\nself as a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; servant. A servant simply serves the master. S=\r\nimilarly, all &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; sadhana you do and your other\n act=\r\nivities are your way to serve &lt;BR&gt;your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; master.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; A rich landlord may be very wealthy a=\r\nnd have many big checks &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; everyday to cash and also many b=\r\nig checks everyday to mail &lt;BR&gt;others. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Yet, he may need =\r\na servant to physically carry papers to the &lt;BR&gt;bank and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n do the needful. Similarly, god is capable of doing anything in &lt;BR&gt;this &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; world and yet god needs human beings who execute god&#39;s age=\r\nnda &lt;BR&gt;in this &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; world. That is why various gods (includi=\r\nng Vishnu himself) and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; various rishis keep coming back t=\r\no earth every now and then. &lt;BR&gt;The &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; supreme god of this =\r\nworld operates through various physical &lt;BR&gt;persons &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; pres=\r\nent on earth.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; We do homam an=\r\nd other spiritual sadhana, purify ourselves &lt;BR&gt;and try &lt;BR&gt;&gt;\n &gt; &gt;=\r\n to help others, because that is god&#39;s work. Just as a servant &lt;BR&gt;carries =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; master&#39;s papers to the bank, we do such work for god.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Doing what is applauded by oth=\r\ners as good work tends to &lt;BR&gt;promote ego &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and we need to=\r\n guard against it. A servant carrying a million &lt;BR&gt;dollar &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; check to the bank and cashing it is NOT superior to a servant &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; carrying a $100 check to the bank and cashing it. Both are &lt;BR&gt;mer=\r\nely &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; doing their master&#39;s work and do not own anything. B=\r\noth are &lt;BR&gt;just &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; *instruments* used by the master to car=\r\nry out his agenda. &lt;BR&gt;Similarly, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; one who does what are =\r\nconsidered great deeds in this world and &lt;BR&gt;one &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; who doe=\r\ns what are considered meagre deeds in this world are &lt;BR&gt;both &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; servants of god helping god execute god&#39;s agenda in\n this &lt;BR&gt;world. =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; Neither really owns anything. One may consider oneself &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;superior to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the other because his/her deeds are consi=\r\ndered superior by the &lt;BR&gt;world, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; but he/she is just as f=\r\noolish as a servant who considers &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; himself/herself superi=\r\nor to another servant carrying something &lt;BR&gt;less &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; valuab=\r\nle.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; If this attitude of bein=\r\ng a servant of god fully penetrates &lt;BR&gt;one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; attitude, =\r\nthinking and instincts, one is safe no matter what &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; situa=\r\ntions his previous karmas place one in. One can remain &lt;BR&gt;happy and &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &gt; blissful in pleasure and pain, in praise and criticism and in =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;light &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and darkness.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Have the same attitude towards your sadhana like homam. It &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;is a job &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; you are doing for\n god. You do the best you =\r\ncan. But you own &lt;BR&gt;nothing. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You are doing it for god.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- =\r\n--------- --------- --------&lt;BR&gt;- -&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do a Short Homam=\r\n Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;=\r\nhttp://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ &lt;BR&gt;homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Do Pi=\r\ntri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; rologer.org/ &lt;BR&gt;tarpana&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://groups./&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dno=\r\nfollow&gt;http://groups.&lt;/A&gt; yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro./&quot; target=3D_=\r\nblank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro.&lt;/A&gt; home.comcast. &lt;BR&gt;net&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://www.vedic=\r\nast/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst&lt;/A&gt; &lt;BR&gt;rologer.or=\r\ng&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;htt=\r\np://www.srijagan/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan&lt;/A&gt; &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;nath.org&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------&lt;BR&gt;- - &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; ----- Original Message ----- &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; From: rajarshi nandy=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; &gt; Sent: Thursday, December 04, 2008 12:47 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Dear Narasimhaji&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Reading your response another question came into my mind=\r\n. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; You said:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; It is not good if fire is extinguished by rain in\n the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; middle of a homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Is it n=\r\not good that the fire gets extinguished by rain, or &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; the =\r\nfact that the fire is getting extinguished?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; I mean actyually i feel when someone starts doing homa &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; regularly, there can be instances when the homa agni gets &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; extinguished while the homa is still on..happened with me =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;couple of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; times... i seriously dont knbow what to ma=\r\nke of it but as one &lt;BR&gt;member &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; in this list had suggeste=\r\nd to me, i relight the fire and keep &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; continuing with the=\r\n homa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The upsurge=\r\n (of consciousness) is Bhairava - Shiva\n Sutra&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/12/08, Narasimha P=\r\nVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; F=\r\nrom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Subject: Re: [ve=\r\ndic-wisdom] Regarding Maha Ganapati Homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; To: vedic-=\r\nwisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Cc: &quot;Phanikumar Velaga&quot; &lt=\r\n;itsverysimple@ &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 December, 200=\r\n8, 6:48 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; Namaste Phani,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1=\r\n)Can Homam be performed on the roof top of a house(3-&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; flo=\r\nors) ? Can a homam&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; kundam made by arranging red=\r\n bricks, with sand base be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; used instead of a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; copper one?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Yes, you can do it on a rooftop.\n Doing it in the open is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; actually better than doing it in closed space. But realize &lt;BR&gt;that a &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; rain can cause problems. Keep an umbrella around to protec=\r\nt &lt;BR&gt;the fire &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; if it rains while you are doing homam. It=\r\n is not good if fire &lt;BR&gt;is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; extinguished by rain in the =\r\nmiddle of a homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Yes, you =\r\ncan construct a homa kundam with bricks and sand &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; at the =\r\nbottom. Use a square shaped huma kunda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2)While performing the Homam using the mp3 audio file, &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; should one repeat the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; mantras m=\r\nentally along with the audio?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt=\r\n; One can repeat mentally while listening attentively (not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; casually). Actually, even listening to mantras with all the &lt;BR&gt;attentio=\r\nn &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;\n focused is as powerful as saying mantras.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Suppose person X is chanting a mantra a=\r\nnd thinking of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; some mundane matter in the mind. Suppose =\r\nperson Y is listening &lt;BR&gt;to it &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; with focus and thinking =\r\nof the mantra and its deity. Then the &lt;BR&gt;mantra &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; may do =\r\nnothing for person X and yet person Y may benefit from &lt;BR&gt;the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; &gt; mantra. The word mantra means &quot;one that protects the mind&quot;.. &lt;BR&gt;One=\r\n can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; say a mantra or listen to a mantra, to be protected=\r\n. The key &lt;BR&gt;is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; control over the mind and keeping the m=\r\nind focused on the &lt;BR&gt;mantra.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &g=\r\nt; However, there is a difference between meditation and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n homam. Mantra is submitted in the internal fire in meditation &lt;BR&gt;and it &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; is submitted in the external fire as well in a homam. So =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;making\n some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; external sound (even if feeble) is a go=\r\nod idea as opposed to &lt;BR&gt;silent &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; chanting or just listen=\r\ning. Try to repeat slowly.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &=\r\ngt; 3)Can bachelors do Maha Ganapati Homam? Any Other &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; co=\r\nnditions/niyamas that&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; should be followed apart =\r\nfrom having vegeterain food?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n Yes. Anybody whose upanayanam (sacred thread ceremony) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nhas been performed can do it. Bachelor or married is &lt;BR&gt;irrelevant.&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One should follow the yamas and ni=\r\nyamas set by one&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; guru. Whatever rules one&#39;s guru sets,=\r\n one should follow them &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; strictly. At the minimum, one sh=\r\nould eat only vegetarian food &lt;BR&gt;on the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; day of homam an=\r\nd take a bath before homam. Another rule I will &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; recommen=\r\nd is\n to avoid eating any solid food 2 hours before &lt;BR&gt;homam.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; By the way, if one without a sacred thre=\r\nad wants to do &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; homam for spiritual progress, I am willin=\r\ng to take &lt;BR&gt;responsibility and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; allow them to do it. Su=\r\nch a person can think of me or my guru &lt;BR&gt;as guru &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; and p=\r\nerform homam. I am willing to take on any karma incurred &lt;BR&gt;in the &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; &gt; &gt; process until the person crosses some minimum threshhold of &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;purity &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &gt; through homam and other spiritual practices.
