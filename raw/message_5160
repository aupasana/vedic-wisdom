But, some m=\r\nay apply the word of Devi to just chanting the saptashati and maintain that=\r\n chanting the navarna mantra containing beejas requires initiation. Thus, t=\r\nhose who insist on initiation can still do, despite your quote.\n \n*        =\r\n*        *\n \nIf one has a sense of surrender and does one&#39;s sadhana with hu=\r\nmility, without expecting any specific results, one is then safe - initiati=\r\non or no initiation. That is the bottomline in my firm view.\n \nThe very und=\r\nerstanding that spiritual sadhana is as a fundamental need as eating, drink=\r\ning and breathing, that one should surrender to god and do sadhana with hum=\r\nility, and that one should not expect specific results and leave things to =\r\ngod, is a good initiation in any sadhana.\n \nAs one&#39;s sadhana progresses, so=\r\nme blocking karmas are burnt by the deity and some spillage during the proc=\r\ness will have to be experienced by the sadhaka, initiation or no initiation=\r\n. Do sadhana and accept what comes your way as the prasad from Him/Her. Eve=\r\nntually, you will progress. Sometimes what seems like a bad thing can actua=\r\nlly bring good. We have limited visibility, but God knows everything.\n \nIf =\r\nyou want a slow path with minimal spillage, pick a soumya devata. If you wa=\r\nnt a fast path with possibly more spillage, pick an ugra devata.\n \n*       =\r\n *        *\n \nNarayan Iyer, one of the list members, was initiated into a K=\r\naali mantra by a learned priest in late 2005. After finishing the sadhana w=\r\nith it, he lost his job. Instead of worrying, he took it as a sign that tha=\r\nt sadhana was working! He did not even submit his resume anywhere, took a b=\r\nreak and went to India for a long pilgrimage. While on that trip, he joined=\r\n Manish and me for the Shata Chandi homam at Kalikambal temple in Chennai i=\r\nn March 2006. He happened to be the only person present when the Divine Mot=\r\nher appeared before Manish and gave a command to spread simple homam proced=\r\nures. He had a crucial role in the creation of &quot;do it yourself&quot; homam manua=\r\nls that are now helping so many people do a homam by themselves everyday or=\r\n every week!\n \n*        *        *\n \nSeveral hundred years ago, it would ha=\r\nve been unfathomable to find books openly giving navarna mantra, Siddha Kun=\r\njika stotra, Gayatri mantra, Lakshmi Narayana Hridayas etc. Nature is slowl=\r\ny opening up avenues for good sadhakas coming in future to find out things =\r\nby themselves. In future times, there will be people who have great potenti=\r\nal as sadhakas but having limited access to formal religious and spiritual =\r\ninstitutions, i.e. deeply desirous of worshipping god but not knowing how t=\r\no. On the other hand, there will be people who have easy access to knowledg=\r\ne, but not having interest or potential.\n \nIt is actually happening already=\r\n to an extent. Many brahmanas who know how to do various rituals are disint=\r\nerested in them and pursue money and fame. Some inquisitive and spirited yo=\r\nung people who were thirsty for spiritual knowledge and spiritual progress,=\r\n but not knowing how to do any sadhana, including how to even light a lamp,=\r\n are now doing daily Chandi homam (or some other homam) by themselves.\n \nBe=\r\nst regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n  Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Writi=\r\nngs,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n   =\r\n               http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n     Films that make a differ=\r\nence: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n     Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/=\r\ngroup/vedic-wisdom\n--------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-----------\n \n---- &quot;nagraj@...&quot; &lt;nagraj_um@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; D=\r\near Satya Prakashji, \n&gt; \n&gt; Wonderful reply and the link. So essentially I a=\r\nm interpreting the verse in the following manner after all this discussion.=\r\n \n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Better to do Chandi Path and Homa (or any other sadhana) than not=\r\n doing at all.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. If one is attracted to Chandi Path and/or Homa, inst=\r\nead of waiting for initiation and not doing anything, it is better to get s=\r\ntarted and practise the same until you get initiation on Someday in some li=\r\nfe, which is bound to happen due to boundless affection of Ma anyway. \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n 3. After getting started and practising for any length of time, one should=\r\n not get carried away by the feeling of doer-ship and keep doing with a fee=\r\nling of surrender, which I think is the hardest part. Even doing Ganapati h=\r\nomam regularly, sometimes gives me a superiority feeling and holier-than-th=\r\nou attitude, when I quickly remember of Shri PVR Garu, to come back to my s=\r\nenses. \n&gt; \n&gt; BTW, I came across a book on Bhagavadgita by Shri Vidyaprakash=\r\nanandagiri in Telugu. The book is called &quot;geeta makarandamu&quot;. In this wonde=\r\nrful book he not only gave meanings and interpretations of Geeta but he eve=\r\nn gave specific ways practising several deekshas with several slokas of Gee=\r\nta and specific yantrams. Being a peethadhipati and excellent pravachana ka=\r\nrtha, this great man did not include any cautionary statements about initia=\r\ntion or Upadesha on these practises. So, I am thinking of practising the sa=\r\nme when the appropriate time comes, assuming that initiation is not needed.=\r\n If any seniors in this forum have gone through this book or have more know=\r\nledge on the same, I will be happy if they share their knowledge/opinions o=\r\nn the same. \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards, \n&gt; \n&gt; Nagraj \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogrou=\r\nps.com, &quot;Dr Satya Prakash&quot; &lt;backtocosmicroots@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Namaste Nagraj ji,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;I am wondering why people are not discussi=\r\nng about my question &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;no. 1 in mail to Shri Satya Prakash Garu. Is somet=\r\nhing inherently &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;wrong with question itself? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; No sir. Ther=\r\ne is nothing wrong with the question itself. In fact it is a very good ques=\r\ntion in view of the big picture.   \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Whilst the Devi is assuri=\r\nng us that She will fondly accept all acts of worship, sacrificial offering=\r\ns and homas whether they are done with appropriate knowledge or not, Her as=\r\nsurance need not be taken as *permission* to dispense with knowledge of the=\r\n same. She is proclaiming just as Lord Krishna too proclaims in the B. Gita=\r\n,&quot;Aham hi sarvayajnanam bhokta ca prabhur eva ca&quot; (9.24) and &quot;Patram puspam=\r\n phalam toyam yo me bhaktya prayacchati...&quot; (9.28). \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Most of the v=\r\nerses in the Devi Mahatmyam have parallels in the B. Gita and Upanishads. S=\r\ntudying the 9th chapter of the B. Gita will enable the sadhaka to comprehen=\r\nd the depth of this verse better. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Lord Krishna further proclaims =\r\n(9.30), &quot;Even if the most sinful person worships me with unwavering devotio=\r\nn, he must be considered as righteous for he has made the right resolve&quot;. S=\r\no are we to understand that the sinful person straightaway attains the same=\r\n state as the righteous? No, certainly not. The Lord Himself unambigiously =\r\nclarifies this in the very next verse wherein He says that such a person &quot;B=\r\nECOMES&quot; righteous and attains everlasting peace. Here the EFFECT of the RIG=\r\nHT RESOLVE is declared and the devotees are assured that they will never pe=\r\nrish.  \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Likewise the Devi too is assuring us that She will fondly =\r\naccept all acts of worship, sacrificial offerings and homas whether they ar=\r\ne done with appropriate knowledge or not. Her devotees will never perish ir=\r\nrespective of whether they have the right knowledge of how to worship Her o=\r\nr not. She will fondly accept the worship, offerings etc of both classes of=\r\n devotees. In accordance with Lord Krishna&#39;s affirmation, here too those wh=\r\no worship Her without appropriate knowledge of mantras, procedures etc, by =\r\ntheir very resolve to worship Her, will soon attain the knowledge of the sa=\r\nme and thereby attain Her. This verse is also a reminder that one need not =\r\nstay away from worshipping Her because they have no knowledge or only limit=\r\ned knowledge of how to worship Her. Every sadhaka has to perform the worshi=\r\np to the best of his/her abilities sincerely and humbly after surrendering =\r\nto Her. Her grace will enable the rest to happen naturally be it the requir=\r\ned knowledge or initiation or something else. In conclusion through this ve=\r\nrse, the Devi is encouraging all of us to worship Her irrespective of our c=\r\nurrent level of knowledge.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Satya Prakash\n\n\n"}}
