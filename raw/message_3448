Y=\r\nou are lucky to have spent time\n&gt; with Manish in the blessed city of Kashi =\r\nand that too at the blessed\n&gt; Manikarnika ghat.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; There is someth=\r\ning about Manish and dogs. Even when we two were doing\n&gt; a Chandi homam ato=\r\np a hill in Kurukshetra in May 2008, a similar thing\n&gt; happened. A pack of =\r\n7-8 dogs living on that hill came and sat around the\n&gt; homam to watch. They=\r\n were calm for the entire homam (a couple of hours)\n&gt; and watched it. When =\r\nbali (we used raisins, i.e. kismis) was offered at\n&gt; the end, they all got =\r\nup together and ran in one direction barking and\n&gt; jumping up. It was as th=\r\nough they were trying to chase someone.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Some say that several a=\r\nnimals, especially dogs, have subtle\n&gt; extra-sensory perception that is sup=\r\nerior to that of humans.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2=\r\n =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n&gt; =C2  *\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; That homam is still fresh in my mind.=\r\n When we were climbing that hill\n&gt; in the afternoon to do some shooting, Ma=\r\nnish told me, &quot;we have a strong\n&gt; connection with this place. Something wil=\r\nl happen here today.&quot; When we\n&gt; discovered two Nath path sadhus following G=\r\norakhnath (Gorakshanath)\n&gt; living there, we talked to them for a while. Man=\r\nish saw their homa\n&gt; kundam there and asked, &quot;we do a Chandi homam everyday=\r\n. Can we do it in\n&gt; your homa kundam tonight?&quot; The person said, &quot;we are wor=\r\nshippers of\n&gt; Narayana and do not want any taamasik deities to be called or=\r\n any\n&gt; taamasik practices resorted to.&quot; We told him we would call Mahalaksh=\r\nmi\n&gt; in fire and there would be no taamasik practices. Then he consented.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; We left and reached the hill with materials around 8:30 pm. The =\r\nhill\n&gt; and its surroundings were pitch dark and silent. There was no\n&gt; elec=\r\ntricity in that area. We climbed the hill using Manish&#39;s cell phone\n&gt; backl=\r\night to show the way. There were several dogs there and they\n&gt; started bark=\r\ning when they saw us climbing. But when we started the\n&gt; homam, dogs stoppe=\r\nd barking and sat around the fire calmly. An old sadhu\n&gt; also came out of t=\r\nhe hut and sat near the fire.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; The moment The Mother was invoked=\r\n in fire, the whole place that was\n&gt; silent till then except for our chants=\r\n suddenly came alive with all\n&gt; kinds of sounds. There was a valley in the =\r\neastern direction. A lot of\n&gt; birds suddenly rose up from their trees in th=\r\nat area and started making\n&gt; loud sounds. The whole area resounded with the=\r\n sounds of birds, beetles\n&gt; etc. Given the silence till then, this huge com=\r\nmotion felt quite eerie.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2=\r\n =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n&gt; =C2  *\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; While on the topic of that trip, I ca=\r\nn mention something personal that\n&gt; demonstrates how pride keeps coming bac=\r\nk, as taught by Ramakrishna in\n&gt; the story sent by Prasanth today.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; During that trip in the Indian summer of 2008, Manish kept on feeding\n&gt;=\r\n my ego. He praised me to the skies in front of several people. When a\n&gt; la=\r\ndy saint in the lineage of Upasani Maharaj was talking about Upasani\n&gt; Maha=\r\nraj, Manish would bring me into the topic and mention great things\n&gt; about =\r\nme. As he kept praising me in front of people, I was first\n&gt; unaffected. Bu=\r\nt it slowly got to my head. I started to feel special.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; On the n=\r\night of that homam atop a hill in Kurukshetra, Manish relaxed\n&gt; his rule of=\r\n not allowing another person to put aahutis in fire when\n&gt; doing homam. Tho=\r\nugh the plan was that I would do homam in my homa kundam\n&gt; and Manish would=\r\n do in their homa kundam, he changed his mind at the\n&gt; last minute and said=\r\n we would do together in the same homa kundam. He\n&gt; said I was ready and co=\r\nuld share homam with him. I was ecstatic and saw\n&gt; it as an &quot;acknowledgment=\r\n&quot; of my &quot;spiritual progress&quot;. My already\n&gt; provoked pride peaked with this.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; My mind was filled with proud thoughts and my focus on mantra =\r\nand\n&gt; deity was weak, as we chanted Saptashati during that night&#39;s homam.\n&gt;=\r\n Manish said nothing there. The moment homam was over and we went back,\n&gt; h=\r\ne scolded me with a very stern and serious tone, &quot;what were you\n&gt; thinking?=\r\n We called the Mother in fire and you were so distracted. You\n&gt; wasted a gr=\r\neat opportunity tonight. We are chootiyas (an expletive) and\n&gt; She is the M=\r\nother of the universe. How can you absorb your mind in\n&gt; egoistic thoughts =\r\nin her presence? Had I been strict like my gurus or\n&gt; like the gurus of the=\r\n old times, you would&#39;ve been killed today.&quot; He was\n&gt; in that serious mood =\r\nfor an hour or so and then became very kind and\n&gt; compassionate again. He l=\r\naughed, &quot;are you still thinking about it? Leave\n&gt; it Narasimha. These thing=\r\ns happen. Everything happens for good. I have\n&gt; no doubt you will overcome.=\r\n Time has to come for anything. Don&#39;t worry\n&gt; and keep doing sadhana.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C2\n&gt; &gt; I realized that day that Mahaamaayaa is very powerful. Irrespective=\r\n of\n&gt; what you experience and irrespective of how much progress you make, s=\r\nhe\n&gt; can delude you in a split second. In fact, the experiences one has and=\r\n\n&gt; the progress one makes is not really one&#39;s. She gives them and she uses\n=\r\n&gt; them to bind one. The moment one thinks &quot;I, so-and-so individual, exist&quot;\n=\r\n&gt; and attributes those &quot;experiences&quot; and &quot;progress&quot; to that &quot;I&quot;, one is\n&gt; i=\r\nnstantly bound - there is scope for pride, happiness, unhappiness etc\n&gt; and=\r\n one can be deluded. Constant surrender to the supreme power running\n&gt; the =\r\nuniverse, while performing the duties that one is inspired to\n&gt; perform usi=\r\nng the body inhabited by one and without paying ANY attention\n&gt; to ANY resu=\r\nlts that come, including praises and criticism, is the only\n&gt; solution.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n =C2\n&gt; &gt; This experience taught me a very valuable lesson. What Manish said=\r\n\n&gt; about me to others in my presence may have been a way of testing me. It\n=\r\n&gt; is also possible that it is correct. In either case, it does not matter.\n=\r\n&gt; The persona (body-name-entity) one inhabits on earth is a *temporary*\n&gt; a=\r\nbode allocated to one for fulfilling one&#39;s dharma. Attributes of that\n&gt; per=\r\nsona, including its merits and demerits, are irrelevant to one. The\n&gt; momen=\r\nt one looks at that persona as &quot;I&quot; and forms an attachment to the\n&gt; attribu=\r\ntes of that persona, one gets bound. Instead, one should just use\n&gt; that pe=\r\nrsona to fulfill dharma without forming an attachment. An\n&gt; attachment to a=\r\n persona brings many happinesses and many miseries and\n&gt; binds one, irrespe=\r\nctive of how meritorious that persona is. At the end\n&gt; of the day, everythi=\r\nng that is temporary perishes.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Also, note that pride can strike=\r\n anytime anywhere, as long as one has\n&gt; an attachment to the persona. Keep =\r\ndoing sadhana, while constantly\n&gt; contemplating and guarding against such a=\r\nn attachment. Pride is\n&gt; suppressed for a while, comes back again, is suppr=\r\nessed again, comes\n&gt; back again and so on. This cycle goes on until one&#39;s a=\r\nttachment to the\n&gt; persona is killed completely. This is a long process. Do=\r\nn&#39;t worry too\n&gt; much and just keep doing sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n&gt; =C2  *\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; The thing ab=\r\nout the hungry kid reminds me of something. When Manish\n&gt; and I were climbi=\r\nng down at Girnar around sunset, a lame dog that was\n&gt; walking on 3 legs st=\r\narted following us. It came with us a long way. At\n&gt; one point, it ran ahea=\r\nd of us and sat in front of a roadside (or rather\n&gt; stair-side) stall that =\r\nwas still open. Manish stopped there, bought some\n&gt; biscuit packets and fed=\r\n some to the dog. That dog stopped following us\n&gt; then. In a couple of minu=\r\ntes, we encountered an old man in shoddy\n&gt; clothes. He was weeping. Manish =\r\nstopped and asked him what happened. He\n&gt; said he lost all his money at a h=\r\notel in Junagadh and has no money to\n&gt; even buy food. He decided to just cl=\r\nimb the hill (it has 7,000 stairs!)\n&gt; and go to Dattatreya and leave it to =\r\nhim to help him out. He was\n&gt; climbing up, while we were climbing down. It =\r\nwas getting nearly dark\n&gt; then. Manish gave him a lot of money, all the bis=\r\ncuit packets that were\n&gt; with us and a soft drink. He thanked and gave back=\r\n a few\n&gt; &gt; biscuit pieces to me and said, &quot;you guys keep this.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Later Manish told me the same thing he told you, &quot;you never know when\n&gt; an=\r\nd in what form god comes to test you. Kindness and compassion towards\n&gt; nee=\r\ndy people is an important dharma.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; One does not need to do some=\r\nthing beyond one&#39;s means. But, one can\n&gt; have compassion, feel the other pe=\r\nrson&#39;s pain and help within one&#39;s\n&gt; means.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; I considered the bis=\r\ncuit pieces given back by that old man as\n&gt; Dattatreya&#39;s prasad and ate it.=\r\n Regarding the child you saw, please note\n&gt; that Vatuka Bhairava is depicte=\r\nd as a child.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2\n&gt; =C2  *\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; BTW, the Girnar trip happenened unplanned. We =\r\nwere supposed to be in\n&gt; Dwaraka for one more day shooting for the Krishna =\r\nmovie. But we\n&gt; basically finished what we had intended. So I was thinking =\r\nin my mind\n&gt; with dissatisfaction, &quot;why does Manish want to prolong things =\r\nhere and\n&gt; shoot more? We are done here. Why can&#39;t we just leave Dwaraka an=\r\nd\n&gt; perhaps go to Girnar for a day?&quot; I kept my thoughts to myself. It was\n&gt;=\r\n late in the evening and we were on our way to a Shiva temple at Dwaraka.\n&gt;=\r\n All of a sudden, Manish told the driver to stop and turn back to the\n&gt; hot=\r\nel. He announced that we were leaving for Girnar. He said, &quot;bulawa aa\n&gt; gay=\r\na. hum Girnar jaayenge&quot; (invitation has arrived. We will go to\n&gt; Girnar.) W=\r\ne rushed to the hotel, packed and left in 10 minutes. We\n&gt; reached Girnar a=\r\nround midnight and spent the next day there. For those\n&gt; who do not know, G=\r\nirnar is considered the abode of Lord Dattatreya.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Sometimes, Ma=\r\nnish has the uncanny ability to respond to one&#39;s\n&gt; thoughts. However, he sa=\r\nys it is not his ability, but it is Nature\n&gt; listening to one&#39;s wish and fu=\r\nlfilling through another.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; *=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2  *=C2 =\r\n=C2 =C2 =C2 =C2 =C2\n&gt; =C2  *\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Imagine chess pieces being moved b=\r\ny an expert player thinking &quot;I am an\n&gt; powerful king. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am a =\r\nbeautiful queen. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am\n&gt; a strong knight. I am great&quot;, &quot;I kill=\r\ned a great bishop despite being a\n&gt; pawn. I am great&quot;, &quot;I am just a pawn, b=\r\nut I sacrificed myself to trap\n&gt; the queen. I am great&quot; etc.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; It=\r\n may sound weird, but this is what happens in real life all the\n&gt; time. You=\r\n, I, all these people are pieces in another kind of chess game.\n&gt; Not reali=\r\nzing that a player is moving us, we engage in egoistic\n&gt; thoughts, fake hap=\r\npiness, fake sadness, fake pride, fake shame etc. One\n&gt; is free from all th=\r\nose fake feelings if one realizes this. Of course,\n&gt; that does not mean ina=\r\nction. The inspiration that comes in us to engage\n&gt; in various actions in t=\r\nhe world is like the hand of the player moving\n&gt; the piece.

I see\n&gt; that your signature=\r\n changed after the trip.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; We had a remarkable time at Varanasi.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; The moment our flight landed at the Kashi airport which is actu=\r\nally\n&gt; quite outside the main city of Kashi, Manish said there is something=\r\n in\n&gt; here which is different. The energy is palpable throughout. After\n&gt; c=\r\nhecking in at the hotel we spend the time in roaming around the ghats,\n&gt; wa=\r\ntching the evening Ganga Arati and shooting.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; By 9 PM Manish dec=\r\nided on doing a Chandi homa, at the famous\n&gt; Manikarnika samshan, on a fune=\r\nral pyre. Sadhana in a samshan bhoomi is\n&gt; something that many great sadhak=\r\nas in Hinduism have done before.\n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa used to perform =\r\nvarious sadhanas in a\n&gt; samshan.Sri Trilanga Swami - a great siddha -=C2 sp=\r\nent most of his days\n&gt; near the Manikarnik Samshan doing sadhana.=C2 The ef=\r\nfect that a Samshan\n&gt; has on the human consciousness can be apty used, for =\r\nthose who have such\n&gt; inclination, to further ones spiritual growth. The fi=\r\nre of a funeral\n&gt; pyre is called kravyada agni, an impure form of fire unli=\r\nke the fire of\n&gt; a standard homa agni. However, there have been sadhakas, a=\r\nnd many in\n&gt; number, who has used the samshan agni to perform homas. They c=\r\nhose not\n&gt; to make a distinction between pure and impure.If someone feels t=\r\nhat a\n&gt; funeral pyre is &quot;unholy&quot;, he or she would be better off not trying\n=\r\n&gt; anything in such a fire. The main deities of a samshan bhoomi are\n&gt; Mahak=\r\nala and\n&gt; &gt; Mahakali.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; =C2 We went to buy some samagri - til (bl=\r\nack and white), couple\n&gt; of=C2 full coconuts, flowers, incense stick (agaba=\r\ntti), =C2 kismis,\n&gt; havan samagri. While buying the samagri from a shop ins=\r\nide a lane near\n&gt; the Vishwanath temple, suddenly a small begger child came=\r\n and kept\n&gt; asking for food. There was a sweet shop on the other side of th=\r\ne lane,\n&gt; he pointed to the shop asking for food. Manish turned around, bou=\r\nght\n&gt; some food and gave it to the child. The child was eating when we turn=\r\ned\n&gt; back towards the shop from where we were buying the samagri. In a mome=\r\nnt\n&gt; Manish asked me to check for the child, I turned round and found no on=\r\ne\n&gt; there. I looked in the lane and there was no child anywhere. Just gone,=\r\n\n&gt; vanished! I still remember the child very clearly. Manish smiled and\n&gt; s=\r\naid, &quot; The deity of this place wanted to see whether we=C2 had become\n&gt; so =\r\nbig sadhakas that we=C2 are unable to feed a hungry child=C2 . That\n&gt; is ho=\r\nw God comes to test people.=C2 Kya pata Narayan kab, kaha aur=C2\n&gt; kis\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nroop me mil jaye.&quot;\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; At 11 pm we left for Manikarnik, dressed in =\r\na combination of red and\n&gt; black. Walking along the ghats we reached the sa=\r\nmshan at around eleven\n&gt; thirty. It was quite crowded, with=C2 domes (peopl=\r\ne who work there to\n&gt; help the bodies burn) and the relatives. There were a=\r\nt least 8 to 10\n&gt; pyres burning simultaneously. Right next to it was the Ga=\r\nnges, pitch\n&gt; black at night. We sat on a stairs, waiting for the crowd to =\r\nease out a\n&gt; bit, not sure when that will happen, not sure=C2 how people ar=\r\ne going\n&gt; to react. As we sat observing, the people too were observing us w=\r\nith a\n&gt; mix of curiosity=C2 and possible=C2 apprehension.=C2 Suddenly Manis=\r\nh\n&gt; closed his eyes and meditated some time, then remarked that this place\n=\r\n&gt; has a tremendous energy. Something of almost infinite abilities resides\n&gt;=\r\n in this samshan bhoomi. A deity. While sayingf so he turned behind to\n&gt; lo=\r\nok at something, I too turned. I could see nothing but blank space.\n&gt; But t=\r\nhat very instant the dogs in the samshan went running=C2 to\n&gt; &gt; that direct=\r\nion.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; After waiting like this for about an hour, we found a pyre=\r\n where the\n&gt; relatives had left.The major portion had been burnt already, b=\r\nut there\n&gt; was enough left to last for some time still. We went and sat nex=\r\nt to it.\n&gt; Manish started the homa. The offering was of til. I sat next to =\r\nhim\n&gt; doing the Chandi path, trying to be in sync with his recital. A part =\r\nof\n&gt; my mind was also trying to adjust itself to the ambience. There were\n&gt;=\r\n quite a few people around watching what we were upto. But no one\n&gt; disturb=\r\ned. The dome had to come and take wood from the pyre to light\n&gt; other pyres=\r\n. He did it in the most cautious manner possible, taking\n&gt; pieces from the =\r\nfringe of the pyre. After some time Manish indicated to\n&gt; him not to take a=\r\nny more wood. The dome nodded his head and did not\n&gt; disturb that pyre agai=\r\nn.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Very soon, within half an hour I noticed that a pack of 4/5 =\r\ndogs had\n&gt; come and were sitting around the pyre on which the homa was bein=\r\ng done.\n&gt; As=C2 I=C2 read the Chandi I felt a great pressure on my head, fr=\r\nom\n&gt; all sides. As if a something was pressing hard on my skull, gripping i=\r\nt\n&gt; tight. The concentration become excellent. I soon forgot who was\n&gt; watc=\r\nhing us or anything else around me, except for the sound of the\n&gt; Chandi Pa=\r\nth. Very nice meditation happened. The mind felt like as if it\n&gt; was a piec=\r\ne of iron and there=C2 was a huuuuge magnet nearby which just\n&gt; kept pullin=\r\ng the mind away to some distant place, far, far away from the\n&gt; reality I a=\r\nm normally=C2 accustomed to.=C2 While the homa was on,\n&gt; suddenly=C2 one bl=\r\nack dog from the pack which was sitting nearby, sat\n&gt; up on two legs and ke=\r\npt starting at Manish. For I think about 10 mins it\n&gt; kept staring with it&#39;=\r\ns head pointed in an angular fashion. Its eyes and\n&gt; mannerism gave a feeli=\r\nng as if it is not an animal but a human being\n&gt; &gt; watching. Just staring a=\r\nnd observing every action. Manish said Kala\n&gt; Bhairava had entered into the=\r\n body of that dog.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; The homa finished at around 3 AM. The medita=\r\ntions both at the end as\n&gt; well as in between, were all excellent. The mind=\r\n would just get pulled a\n&gt; few notches above the ordinary with slightest bi=\r\nt of effort.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Simply being in a samshan and observing the human =\r\nbody burning up has\n&gt; a powerful effect on the mind. In a nearby pyre we sa=\r\nw the femur bones\n&gt; of a female human body burning. Both the femurs were vi=\r\nsible and spread\n&gt; apart. In an ordinary setting, this kind of a scene woul=\r\nd mean a woman\n&gt; with &quot;legs spread apart&quot; which has a very sexual connotati=\r\non. In\n&gt; Manikarnik, on that night, it only evoked a feeling of how eventua=\r\nlly\n&gt; the body is merely a covering for something far more real and powerfu=\r\nl\n&gt; that resides inside. The skin, flesh, bones etc will perish as they are=\r\n\n&gt; ment to perish. Only Rama naam satya hai.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Manish said if you=\r\nr intentions of going to a samshan bhoomi is merely\n&gt; to please God through=\r\n sadhanas=C2 - i.e you are not planning something\n&gt; negative nor desirous o=\r\nf petty mundane gains - there is very little\n&gt; chance that you will ever co=\r\nme to harm. Further, when you do a Chandi\n&gt; homa, no ethereal beings will d=\r\nisturb you because no one wants to mess\n&gt; with=C2 someone who is worshippin=\r\ng Chandi. It is not difficult, neither\n&gt; something to be unnecessarily scar=\r\ned of. There are spirits etc for sure,\n&gt; but neither will you bother them n=\r\nor will they bother you. =C2\n&gt; Surrendering to the deity is very good=C2 at=\r\ntitude to have. And\n&gt; finally, the soul of the individual on whose pyre the=\r\n homa is being\n&gt; done, is taken by the Goddess and acquires a lot of punya.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Thus ended my first experience of a Chandi homa on a burning p=\r\nyre.That\n&gt; night was Krishna Saptami. The next two nights again we did homa=\r\ns at\n&gt; Manikarnik.\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =C2 Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; ...to =\r\nbe continued...\n&gt; &gt; =C2\n&gt; &gt; Rama Naama Satya Hai..\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
