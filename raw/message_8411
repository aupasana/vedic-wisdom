Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n Namaste friends,\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; I can suggest the following bare minimum homam =\r\nprocedure to those who have a problem with Sanskrit and find the homam manu=\r\nals daunting. This is the absolute minimum one can do. If done sincerely ev=\r\neryday for 20 min or more, even this procedure can have a very good impact =\r\non one&#39;s spiritual pursuit.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; *        *        *\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Materia=\r\nls needed: Homa kundam, wooden/copper/silver spoon/ladle, melted ghee and p=\r\nieces of dried coconut (or wood or dried cowdung cakes).\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (0) Sit =\r\nfacing east and place homa kundam in front of you.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (1) Place some=\r\n dried coconut pieces or wood or dried cowdung cake pieces in homa kundam (=\r\nfire pit).\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (2) Light a camphor and place it in the homa kundam wh=\r\nile saying &quot;om bhuurbhuvassuvarom&quot; and make sure that the pieces placed in =\r\nhoma kundam catch fire.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (3) Pour ghee drops with a wooden/copper/=\r\nsilver spoon/ladle in the fire while saying the following:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; om pra=\r\njaapataye svaahaa\n&gt; &gt; om indraaya svaahaa\n&gt; &gt; om agnaye svaahaa\n&gt; &gt; om soma=\r\naya svaahaa\n&gt; &gt; om bhuurbhuvassuvaH svaahaa\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (4) Thinking of Ganes=\r\nha in your mind, pour ghee drops in fire while saying the following:\n&gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; om gam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa\n&gt; &gt; om gam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n om gam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa\n&gt; &gt; om gam gaNapataye namaH svaahaa\n&gt; &gt;  \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; (5) Pick any deity and any mantra. Thinking of the deity of the mantra,=\r\n pour ghee drops (or any other valid offering - see manual) while saying th=\r\ne mantra. Just add svaahaa at the end of the mantra. If the mantra already =\r\nhas a svaahaa at the end, there is no need to add one more svaahaa.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; It is also fine to pick a collection of verses (e.g. Vishnu sahasra naam=\r\na stotram, Lakshmi ashtottara sata naama stotram, Lalita sahasra naama stot=\r\nram, Aditya hridayam, Subrahmanyashtakam etc). At the end of each verse, ad=\r\nd svaahaa and make an offering in fire. When the stotram ends, you can go b=\r\nack to the beginning and repeat.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Do this for as much time as you =\r\nwant to. But make sure that you do this step for atleast 10-15 minutes.\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  \n&gt; &gt; (6) When you are done, pour ghee drops in fire while saying the foll=\r\nowing:\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; om bhuuH svaahaa\n&gt; &gt; om bhuvaH svaahaa\n&gt; &gt; om suvaH svaaha=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; om bhuurbhuvassuvaH svaahaa\n&gt; &gt; om shrii viShNave svaahaa\n&gt; &gt; om namo=\r\n rudraaya pashupataye svaahaa\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; (7) Try to surrender your mind as c=\r\nompletely to god as you can. Sit absolutely still and meditate for a few mi=\r\nnutes with any mantra.\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Done!\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimh=\r\na\n&gt; &gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pi=\r\ntri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows)=\r\n: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: ht=\r\ntp://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; &gt; ---------------------------------------------=\r\n---------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
