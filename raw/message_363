When I was meditating b=\r\nefore replying to you, a really beautiful and meaningful analogy came to me=\r\n and I think it is worth sharing with more people than just you. To ensure =\r\nyour anonymity, I removed references in the quoted mail below that may help=\r\n one identify you.\n\n          *        *        *\n\n          First I will a=\r\nnswer your first question in detail, because that can automatically answer =\r\nother questions.\n\n          &gt; 1. Are Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) differen=\r\nt from Mantra Shastras\n          &gt; (people explain that mantra shastra does=\r\n not originate from the vedas,\n          &gt; but classified under tantra). Di=\r\nd Mantra shastras not originate from vedas?\n\n          *        *        *\n=\r\n\n          When people say what is in Veda and what is not, honestly I can =\r\nonly laugh. They are only fooling themselves. Reciting Veda with perfect sw=\r\nara or mastering a celebrated commentary does not help one understand Veda.=\r\n In fact, understanding each single verse in Veda requires great tapaschary=\r\na. Understanding a verse in Veda is neither possible with energy flowing in=\r\n Ida nadi (intuition) nor in Pingala nadi (logic and analysis). It is possi=\r\nble only with energy flowing in Sushumna nadi. It is possible with neither =\r\nintuition nor logic, but only with *revelation* and simply, for the lack of=\r\n a better expression, direct knowledge.\n\n          When one meditates long =\r\nenough on a verse, the verse may simply be revealed to the yogi. THAT is th=\r\ne only way to understand a Vedic verse. For most people, it is not possible=\r\n to decipher even a single verse in an entire life, let alone a passage.\n\n =\r\n         Bottomoline is: Almost nobody understands Veda today. What are con=\r\nsidered &quot;pure vaidika rituals&quot; are merely another variety of rituals create=\r\nd by someone at some point of time. From the point of view of authenticity =\r\nas granted by Veda, there is no difference between them and other aagamic r=\r\nituals, though people ignorantly believe otherwise.\n\n          *        *  =\r\n      *\n\n          A simple analogy may help clarify a lot of things relate=\r\nd to this complicated issue a little. What the thing in the analogy represe=\r\nnts is shown here and there in square brackets [].\n\n          Once there we=\r\nre many people who lived near the sea [Brahman/Aatman] . They regularly sat=\r\n by the sea and enjoyed the sight and sound of the sea [experienced Brahman=\r\n]. They described the sea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].\n\n          As =\r\npeople started living a little away from the sea [less spiritually evolved]=\r\n, someone had to put together some instructions on how to reach the sea. He=\r\n said, &quot;keep walking towards east&quot; and the instructions grew with time. Peo=\r\nple faithfully followed the instructions [rituals].\n\n          People start=\r\ned moving further and further inland and started living in a landlocked des=\r\nert far away from the sea. This generation had never seen a pool of water l=\r\nike a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfully performed the ritual of walkin=\r\ng towards east, but did not find sea. They debated endlessly whether one ha=\r\nd to walk one mile or two miles or three miles and formed different schools=\r\n of thought. Some walked their chosen distance, found a tree or a building =\r\nor some interesting object and even became satisfied that that was sea!\n\n  =\r\n        Then came some great person, whose instincts led him to take a hors=\r\ne instead of walking and ride it for a long distance [use of other tools]. =\r\nHe did find the sea after a few months. He put together newer instructions =\r\nto reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new aagamas].\n\n          P=\r\neople performing the old rituals objected to this and said &quot;but then this h=\r\norse thing is not granted by the book of sea. This is a new path and differ=\r\nent from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [&quot;pure&quot; Vedic ritual]. By now, people did n=\r\not even understand what the cryptic poems of the original &quot;book of sea&quot; mea=\r\nn, but they simply believed that those poems taught the old &quot;pure&quot; sea ritu=\r\nals that they were used to. They were blissfully unaware that the original =\r\ninstructions were meant for someone already close to sea and the newer inst=\r\nructions came from someone who actually saw the sea and knew where they cur=\r\nrently lived and how to get to the sea from there!\n\n          Slowly many n=\r\new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots etc were taught and many=\r\n new paths to the sea were outlined instead of just instructing people to w=\r\nalk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantras].\n\n          One part=\r\nicular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantric pa=\r\nths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to sea =\r\nwas much shorter through that jungle, it was just too dangerous and only th=\r\ne bravest and strongest could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wild an=\r\nimals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak people travelling =\r\nto sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territory =\r\nwell came forward, condemned that path and discouraged people from trying t=\r\nhat path. Since then, even people who were strong enough to successfully ma=\r\nke it in that path desisted from it.\n\n          As time progressed, people =\r\nstarted fighting too much about whose path was superior. They were foolish,=\r\n not smart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-call=\r\ned &quot;pure&quot; sea path or the so-called &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for the=\r\n changed geography and changed times. Many followed the instructions blindl=\r\ny, hit roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that &quot;reach=\r\ning the sea&quot; was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought t=\r\nhey were supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and there was no ne=\r\ned to adopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They even conde=\r\nmned those who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated directions =\r\nfor their place and time, for violating tradition.\n\n          *        *   =\r\n     *\n\n          In case the analogy is not clear, here is a brief summary=\r\n of its points. Veda is about realizing self. Veda describes various aspect=\r\ns of the state of self-realization. That is why it is considered the highes=\r\nt knowledge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible ways to rea=\r\nch that state. While definitive statements can be made on the actual state =\r\nof self-realization itself, no definitive statements can be made on how to =\r\nreach it. The path depends on one&#39;s current position!\n\n          Great men =\r\nin many spiritual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, ex=\r\nperienced that state, understood the current state of people around them an=\r\nd gave specific instructions on how to reach that state from the current st=\r\nate. Some followed the instructions and experienced the state. Some instead=\r\n kept arguing about the contradictions between paths.\n\n          Please re-=\r\nread the story and try to understand what each part of the story represents=\r\n. If you understand this analogy well, this can really clarify the meaningl=\r\ness nature of so many debates that people waste time with!\n\n          *    =\r\n    *        *\n\n          &gt; 2. I read from somewhere that Sri Sri Adi Sanka=\r\nra has condemned\n          &gt; Tantrik practices. But I also hear and read th=\r\nat he is a great Sri Vidya\n          &gt; Upasaka himself. If Sri Vidya has it=\r\ns roots from Tantra, what did\n          &gt; Sri Adi Sankara condemn? \n\n      =\r\n    He did condemn some vaamaachaara (left-hand) practices of tantra like t=\r\nhe use of sex, alcohol, meat etc.\n\n          However, please go back to my =\r\nanalogy. A great man may condemn the use of a short path to reach the sea i=\r\nf it has a lot of wild animals and dacoits and many travellers through that=\r\n path recently lost their lives. It does not mean that path is totally unus=\r\nable. It only means that too many people incapable of travelling on that pa=\r\nth are using it of late and so the great man was compelled to stop the prac=\r\ntice.\n\n          If the same great man is reincarnated at a different time =\r\nwhen several adept souls he has a rina with are about to be reincarnated, h=\r\ne may not condemn the path and instead write on travelling that jungle path=\r\n carefully!\n\n          The words of great masters need to be interpreted wi=\r\nthin the context of their desa, kaala and paatra and within the context of =\r\nthe purpose of that particular birth.\n\n          *        *        *\n\n     =\r\n     &gt; 3. What is vamachara? if it is the left hand method - sex, drinks et=\r\nc,\n          &gt; why must it be practiced at all?\n\n          Suppose one&#39;s ho=\r\nuse is close to the market and the market noise reaches one&#39;s house. Suppos=\r\ne that noise is disturbing one&#39;s meditation, i.e. one is unable to focus on=\r\n god amid all the noise. There are two approaches one can take - (1) run aw=\r\nay from the noise, find a place of solitude and meditate there. (2) rise to=\r\n the challenge, meditate right there and develop the ability to turn off th=\r\ne sensory input to the mind, i.e. get mastery and control over the part of =\r\nthe mind that is making one vulnerable to this disturbance. After all, the =\r\nnoise from outside is NOT the problem - the problem is the *inability* of o=\r\nne&#39;s mind to turn off that sensory input. By controlling one&#39;s mind, one ca=\r\nn focus attention on god irrespective of what is happening outside.\n\n      =\r\n    Approach (1) is not bad. If one is weak-minded and has a decent chance =\r\nof failure with approach (2), then approach (1) is definitely prudent and w=\r\northwhile. But, if one has a strong mind and can succeed with approach (2),=\r\n it is great. It hastens one&#39;s progress.\n\n          *        *        *\n\n  =\r\n        Vaamaachaara is also like that, but a more extreme form of testing =\r\none&#39;s self-control by rising to the challenge.\n\n          Please realize th=\r\nat vaamaachaara/ aghora is not about the use of sex, wine etc for the kick =\r\nof it. It is about their use to test oneself with the toughest challenges a=\r\nnd hone one&#39;s self-control. Self-realization comes when self-control is per=\r\nfect and one&#39;s mind can always be focussed on god no matter what is going o=\r\nn around one. If one is either attracted or averse to any one thing, that i=\r\ns enough to block self-realization.\n\n          However, if one is weak, it =\r\nis better to stay away from vaamaachaara. One needs to do other practices a=\r\nnd strengthen oneself. If a really pure yogi with perfect self-control is a=\r\nble to focus on god with all his mind even when he is drunk and sitting nak=\r\ned with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing him, then he can try that=\r\n to test his self-control and hone it. But, if that is going to tempt one, =\r\nget the mind away from god and onto a physical enjoyment, then one better n=\r\not try that path! Just as one who does not have a strong mind to meditate a=\r\nmid noise should meditate in solitude and hone one&#39;s self-control, one who =\r\ndoes not have a strong mind to keep the focus on god in the middle of norma=\r\nlly depriving practices such as wine, meat and sex should stay away from th=\r\nose.\n\n          *        *        *\n\n          In my analogy before, the sh=\r\nort jungle path to the sea having the danger of wild animals and dacoits re=\r\npresents the vaamaachaara path of aghora. If one not having the wherewithal=\r\n to battle and kill the wild animals and dacoits tries that path, one may b=\r\ne killed. Similarly, one who wants self-realization using this path will fa=\r\nll if one does not have perfect self-control. If one takes this path becaus=\r\ne it sounds cool or exciting, one is likely to fall. It is only for the fit=\r\ntest and bravest.\n\n          If there is ANY weakness in one&#39;s self-control=\r\n, one can NOT follow this path. Just as there are many paths from the deser=\r\nt to the sea in my analogy, there are many paths to self-realization. One s=\r\nhould follow the path that is appropriate for one based on previous samskar=\r\nas, strengths and weaknesses.\n\n          *        *        *\n\n          &gt; I=\r\ns it not a fact that Sri Ambal lies above all these? \n\n          :-) Sri Am=\r\nbal (the Divine Mother) does not lie above or below anything. She lies ever=\r\nywhere! All knowledge, all desires and all actions of all beings are Her ow=\r\nn different manifestations.\n\n          If a yogi with perfect self-control =\r\ndrinks wine and sits naked with a beautiful naked woman tightly embracing h=\r\nim and yet keeps his mind fully focussed on god, his self-control, his focu=\r\ns on god are all different manifestations of the Divine Mother only.\n\n     =\r\n     As a matter of fact, even if one gives in to base instincts and pursue=\r\ns carnal pleasures, his desires and actions are also different manifestatio=\r\nns of Divine Mother only. The Mother gives rise to so many lower level form=\r\ns with specific domains of responsibility. The Mother takes the form of Lak=\r\nshmi and Alakshmi as well. She takes the form of Vidya and Avidya as well. =\r\nAll opposites and polarities are actually Her manifestations only.\n\n       =\r\n   However, those who are more comfortable with Lakshmi and Vidya and uncom=\r\nfortable with Alakshmi and Avidya will look at only the former pair as mani=\r\nfestation of Divine Mother and remain in duality. That is a valid point of =\r\nview. However, the *ultimate* reality is that She is All.\n\n          I need=\r\n to sleep now. I will stop here. Hope that put a few things in perspective.=\r\n You can send further questions to the yahoogroups or to me privately.\n\n   =\r\n       Best regards,\n          Narasimha\n          ------------ --------- -=\r\n-------- --------- --------- --------- ---------\n          Do a Short Homam=\r\n Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n          Do Pitri Tarpan=\r\nas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n          Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n          Free Jyotish les=\r\nsons (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n          Free Jyotish sof=\r\ntware (Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n          Sri Jagannath Ce=\r\nntre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n          ------------ ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- \n\n            Sri =\r\nSri NarasimhaJI\n            Namaskarams.

Suppose that \n          noise&nbsp;is disturbing one&#39;s me=\r\nditation, i.e. one is unable to focus \n          on god amid all the noise.=\r\n There are two approaches one can take - (1) \n          run away from the n=\r\noise, find a place of solitude and meditate there. \n          (2) rise to t=\r\nhe challenge, meditate right there and develop the \n          ability to tu=\r\nrn off the sensory input to the mind, i.e. get mastery \n          and contr=\r\nol over the part of the mind that is making one vulnerable to \n          th=\r\nis disturbance. After all, the noise from outside is NOT the problem \n     =\r\n     - the problem is the *inability* of one&#39;s mind to turn off that \n     =\r\n     sensory input. By controlling one&#39;s mind, one can focus attention on \n=\r\n          god irrespective of what is happening outside.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n     =\r\n     &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;Approach (1) is not bad. If one is \n          wea=\r\nk-minded and has a decent chance of failure with approach (2), then \n      =\r\n    approach (1) is definitely prudent and worthwhile. But, if one has a \n =\r\n         strong mind and can succeed with approach (2), it is great.

It =\r\nis about \n          their use to test oneself with the toughest challenges =\r\nand hone one&#39;s \n          self-control. Self-realization comes when self-co=\r\nntrol is perfect and \n          one&#39;s mind can always be focussed on god no=\r\n matter what is going on \n          around one. If one is either attracted =\r\nor averse to any one thing, \n          that is enough to block self-realiza=\r\ntion.&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;However, if one is weak, =\r\nit is better to \n          stay away from vaamaachaara. One needs to do oth=\r\ner practices and \n          strengthen oneself. If a really pure yogi with =\r\nperfect self-control is \n          able to focus on god with all his mind e=\r\nven when he is drunk and \n          sitting naked with a beautiful naked wo=\r\nman tightly embracing him, then \n          he can try that to test his self=\r\n-control and hone it. But, if that is \n          going to&nbsp;tempt one, g=\r\net the mind away from god and onto a \n          physical enjoyment, then on=\r\ne better not try that path! Just as one who \n          does not have a stro=\r\nng mind to meditate amid noise should meditate in \n          solitude and h=\r\none one&#39;s self-control, one who does not have a strong \n          mind to k=\r\neep the focus on god in the middle of normally depriving \n          practic=\r\nes such as wine, meat and sex should stay away from \n          those.&lt;/FONT=\r\n&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n    =\r\n      &lt;DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial \n          size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; \n          *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=\r\np;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/=\r\nFONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n          &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;In my analogy =\r\nbefore, the short jungle \n          path to the sea having the danger of wi=\r\nld animals and dacoits \n          represents the vaamaachaara path of aghor=\r\na. If one not having the \n          wherewithal to battle and kill the wild=\r\n animals and dacoits tries that \n          path, one may be killed.

Are Vedic (Pure Vaithika rituals) \n       =\r\n     different from Mantra Shastras (people explain that mantra shastra \n  =\r\n          does not originate from the vedas, but classified under tantra). =\r\nDid \n            Mantra shastras not originate from vedas?&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n   =\r\n         &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;2.

If Sri Vidya =\r\nhas \n            its roots from Tantra, what did Sri Adi Sankara condemn? \n=\r\n            &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FO=\r\nNT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;3. What is vam=\r\nachara? if it is the left \n            hand method - sex, drinks etc, why m=\r\nust it be practiced at all? Is \n            it not a fact that Sri Ambal li=\r\nes above all these? &lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n            &lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;I am =\r\na little (totally) confused.
