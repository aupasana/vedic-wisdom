The  bhog aarti had just =\r\nbegun when we reached.We stayed there for the whole aarti.There were bhajan=\r\ns and strotras from chandi path being sung.It was a great atmosphere.It fel=\r\nt great.\n   And finaly,we went to Gangasagar.It was shani pradosh  of karti=\r\nk that day,though i dont know if it has any importance!.\n    I felt nice.La=\r\nst year, i had seen the udgam of Gangaji at Gaumukh ,and here i was, at the=\r\n final resting  point of Ganga.\n            A cycle complete. \nI feel very =\r\nnice and content.Whole and complete.even when writing  this.I wish to stay =\r\nwith this feeling for sometime,so i will stop here.\nThankyou once again for=\r\n your advice and wishes,\n\nSunita.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@...=\r\nm, Dev Sarkar &lt;sarkar_dbx@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Members,\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; I would agr=\r\nee to Rajarshiji about the Kaalighat priest / pandas.\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; About Dakshin=\r\neshwar, I would like to add a few more words based on my experience. I have=\r\n been visiting this temple since the age of 10 and I have seen how things h=\r\nave changed around the temple but fortunately the peace inside the temple s=\r\ntill prevails and I do get a lot of positive energy. Incidently, my Istha d=\r\nevata is Maa Kaali and I could feel her divine grace much more than Kaaligh=\r\nat ( my personal opinion).\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Over the period of years the temple has =\r\ngained importance nationally / globally due to=A0Sri Ramkrishna, Sharda Maa=\r\n and Swami Vivekanda&#39;s ashram. Hence the pilgrims & tourist inflow has incr=\r\neased by many folds but still the authorities are trying to maintain a clea=\r\nn atmosphere / surroundings as compared to Kaalighat. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; Here too the=\r\n priest are commercial minded but not as much obvious as in Kaalighat. The =\r\ndevotees do not get much time to have the darshan of Maa due to the long cr=\r\nowd as well as your feet will burn if the sun is shining bright. But what I=\r\n suggest is that just opposite to the temple is a open hall from where Maa =\r\nKaali can be seen clearly as Maa&#39;s idol is much elevated=A0 (please note th=\r\nat you will have to take about 20 steps to have her darshan). I sit in this=\r\n hall and try to get a place where I can see her clearly and then meditate =\r\nonce my system has absorbed her full Rupa - a pleasant feeling. Forget the =\r\ncrowd around you and you can have a good dialouge with Maa. \n&gt; =A0\n&gt; After =\r\nMaa&#39;s darshan walk down to the abode of Shri Ramkrishna , your mind will be=\r\n so peaceful after the meditation - so much of positive energy around there=\r\n. The next hop would be a pleasant boat ride ( I prefer that as it make me =\r\nclose to mother nature - car ride is also possible)=A0visit the Swami Vivek=\r\nananda Ashram . Well I bet the day is well spent and you will feel better.\n=\r\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; (this is my personal experience and it might differ from others, bu=\r\nt a place worth visiting)\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Warm Regards,=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; Debabrato Sarkar\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Mon, 10/12/09, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nFrom: rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Hol=\r\ny Places\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Date: Monday, October 12, 200=\r\n9, 7:20 AM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =A0 \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Dear Sunita,\n&gt; =A0\n&gt; If y=\r\nou are going to the Kaalighat temple, you need to be careful of the local p=\r\nriests/pandas.
