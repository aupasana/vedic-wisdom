The sacred scriptures of both Yoga and Sanata=\r\nna Dharma teach us that our true, innermost nature is that we are atman, or=\r\n eternal units of consciousness. We have the Absolute (Brahman, or God) as =\r\nboth our causative and substantial source, and as the ontological sustainer=\r\n of our existential being. Having God as our underlying source, it necessar=\r\nily follows that we naturally share in many of God&#39;s essential attributive =\r\nqualities. Because we participate in God&#39;s innate attributes - and if not t=\r\no a quantitatively equivalent degree, then certainly to a qualitative one -=\r\n we too share in many of God&#39;s qualities. One of those attributes that both=\r\n the infinite Godhead and we as finite units of consciousness have in commo=\r\nn is necessary existence. In other words, both God and we ourselves (atmans=\r\n, or souls) are eternal by our inherent nature. God and individual atmans c=\r\nannot but exist. To go out of existence is simply not within the realm of o=\r\nur capability.\n\nNever was there a time when we came into being, and never w=\r\nill there be a time when we cease to exist. So, in a way, we exist because =\r\nwe cannot but exist, being purely spiritual beings in essence. Such is our =\r\nnature, for it is the nature of God, the ultimate source of our being....&quot;\n=\r\n\n\nVISIT HERE TO READ THE REST OF THIS ENLIGHTENING ARTICLE:\n\nhttp://www.dha=\r\nrmacentral.com/forum/content.php?14-Human-Existence\n\n\n\nPlease forward this =\r\ninformation to all sincere spiritual seekers.
