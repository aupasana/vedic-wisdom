You will be subject to trouble through enemies and will suffer calumny. H=\r\nealth hazards manifest.\n&gt; \n&gt; Dissipation of wealth indicated. ( Kurvanthi P=\r\nranasandeham Sthanabramsam Dhanakshayam ).\n&gt; \n&gt; Your mind becomes a melting=\r\n pot of mental turmoil. Saturn creates wilderness in the psyche, making you=\r\n desperate at times. You may not get even proper rest. \n&gt; \n&gt; Problems surfa=\r\nce like a ten-headed Hydra. Once you try to solve one problem, another take=\r\ns its place.\n&gt; \n&gt; Mental peace and happiness make a strategic retreat. Satu=\r\nrn will bend you, not break you.\n&gt; \n&gt; The Western scholars defined Life as =\r\nfull of thorns ( &quot;Life is not a bed of roses&quot;). The Eastern intellectuals d=\r\nefined it as a Vaitharani river, a macabre river whose flow is deathward. Y=\r\nou will feel that they were right in defining life in such dolorous terms\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; Elarata Saturn occurs in Three Phases\n&gt; \n&gt; Phase I - Dwadasa Saturn - T=\r\nhis is when Saturn is in the 12th - Is dangerous but not as severe as Janma=\r\n Saturn\n&gt; \n&gt; Phase II - Janma Saturn - This is when Saturn is in the Lunar =\r\nAsc ( This is severe )\n&gt; \n&gt; Phase III - Dwitheeya Saturn - When Saturn is i=\r\nn the Second - The evil is lessened considerably but the Dosha persists. \n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; On the positive side, you have to understand that the suffering which y=\r\nou undergo are merely wages and that Initiation is a process of intensive c=\r\nulture and accelerated evolution. Many lessons will be learnt during this p=\r\nhase.
