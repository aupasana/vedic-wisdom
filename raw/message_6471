(Reply): These two meanings do not accord with the Advaita view. They=\r\n\npostulate a difference between Jiva and Ishvara, but in the Advaita doctri=\r\nne\nthere is\nno distinction between =E2=80=98That=E2=80=99 and =E2=80=98Thou=\r\n=E2=80=99. Statements appearing to make such\na\ndistinction are only steps t=\r\nowards understanding of non-duality.\n\n235. The Shruti declares that in fact=\r\n there is no destruction and no\norigination; none in bondage and none engag=\r\ned in practice for liberation; no\naspirant for liberation and none liberate=\r\nd. This is the transcendental\ntruth.\n\n236. Maya is said to be the desire-fu=\r\nlfilling cow. Jiva and Ishvara are its\ntwo calves.Drink of its milk of dual=\r\nity as much as you like, but the truth\nis non-duality.\n\n261. Owing to lack =\r\nof true discrimination a man identifies egoism with the\nSelf, and then thin=\r\nks: =E2=80=98May this object be mine=E2=80=99, and so forth. This is\ncalled=\r\n desire.\n\n274. The man who is attached to objects is troubled by the world;=\r\n happiness\nis enjoyed by the unattached. Therefore give up attachment if yo=\r\nu desire to\nbe happy.\n\n283. Without the knowledge of Reality even perfect d=\r\netachment and complete\nwithdrawal from worldly actions cannot lead to liber=\r\nation. A man endowed\nwith\ndetachment and withdrawal, but failing to obtain =\r\nillumination, is reborn in\nthe\nsuperior worlds because of great merit.\n\n284=\r\n. On the other hand by the complete knowledge of the Reality a man is\nsure =\r\nto\nhave liberation, even though his detachment and withdrawal are wanting. =\r\nBut\nthen\nhis visible sufferings will not come to an end owing to his fructi=\r\nfying\nKarma.\n\nVII. THE LAMP OF PERFECT SATISFACTION\n\n20. When a man is as f=\r\nirmly convinced of his identity with Brahman as an\nordinary\nman is convince=\r\nd of his identity with the body, he is liberated even if he\ndoes not\nwish f=\r\nor it.\n\n22. The Self is ever cognised. We speak of Its being known directly=\r\n or\nindirectly,\nbeing known or unknown, as in the illustration of the tenth=\r\n man.\n\n23. The tenth man counts the other nine, each of whom is visible to =\r\nhim, but\nforgets himself the tenth, though all the time seeing himself.\n\n24=\r\n. Being himself the tenth, he does not find him. =E2=80=98The tenth is not\n=\r\nvisible, he is\nabsent=E2=80=99, so he says. Intelligent people say that thi=\r\ns is due to his presence\nbeing\nobscured by ignorance or Maya.\n\n129. If you =\r\ngive up food, you will not live; but will you not be alive if\nyou give up\ns=\r\ntudies (other than scriptures)? So why so much insistence on pursuing such\n=\r\nstudies?\n\n130. (Doubt): How then the ancient knowers like Janaka administer=\r\ned kingdoms\n?\n(Reply): They were able because of their conviction about the=\r\n truth. If you\nhave that,then by all means engage yourself in logic or agri=\r\nculture or do\nwhatever you like.\n\n131. Once he is convinced of the unrealit=\r\ny of the world, a knower, with mind\nundisturbed, allows his fructifying Kar=\r\nma to wear out and engages himself in\nworldly affairs accordingly.\n\n147. =\r\n=E2=80=98The desires are never quelled by enjoyment but increase more like =\r\nthe\nflame of a fire fed on clarified butter=E2=80=99.\n\n162. When a man is n=\r\neither willing nor unwilling to do a thing but does it\nfor the\nfeelings of =\r\nothers and experiences pleasure and pain, it is the result of\n=E2=80=98fruc=\r\ntifying Karma through the desire of others=E2=80=99.\n\n163. (Doubt): Does it=\r\n not contradict the text at the beginning of this\nchapter which\ndescribes t=\r\nhe enlightened man as desireless ? (Reply): The text does not\nmean that\ndes=\r\nires are absent in the enlightened man, but that desires arising in him\nspo=\r\nntaneously without his will produce no pleasure or pain in him, just as\nthe=\r\n\nroasted grain has no potency.\n\n164. Roasted grain though looking the same =\r\ncannot germinate; similarly the\ndesires\nof the knower, well aware of the un=\r\nreality of objects of desire cannot\nproduce merit\nand demerit.\n\n168. That w=\r\nhich is not destined to happen as a result of our past Karma will\nnot happe=\r\nn; that which is to happen must happen. Such knowledge is a sure\nantidote t=\r\no the poison of anxiety; it removes the delusion of grief.\n\n191. There is t=\r\nherefore no contradiction between the two statements in the\nscriptures that=\r\n =E2=80=98desires are a sign of ignorance=E2=80=99 and that =E2=80=98the wi=\r\nse man may\nhave\ndesires=E2=80=99, because the desires of a wise man are too=\r\n weak to bind.\n\n193. Many Shruti texts declare that a husband loves his wif=\r\ne not for her\nsake and the wife loves him not for his sake, but for their o=\r\nwn sake.\n\n198. When King Janaka asked Yajnavalkya about the nature of the S=\r\nelf, the\nsage\nfirst told him of the sheath of intellect and then, pointing =\r\nout its\ninadequacy (to be the Self), ended in teaching him of the immutable=\r\n\nKutastha.\n\n211. It is common experience that the states of waking, dreamin=\r\ng and deep\nsleep are distinct from one another, but that the experiencing c=\r\nonsciousness\nis the same.\n\n213. =E2=80=98When a man realises his identity w=\r\nith that Brahman which illumines the\nworlds\nof the waking, dreaming and sle=\r\neping states, he is released from all bonds=E2=80=99.\n\n214. =E2=80=98One sh=\r\nould consider the Self to be the same in the waking, dreaming\nand sleeping =\r\nstates. That Atman which knows itself as beyond the three\nstates is free fr=\r\nom rebirth=E2=80=99.\n\n215. =E2=80=98That Self which is not subject to exper=\r\nience in any of the three\nstates, which can be called pure consciousness, t=\r\nhe witness, the ever\nblissful and which is neither the enjoyer nor the enjo=\r\nyment or the object of\nenjoyment, That I am=E2=80=99.\n\n225. The subtle body=\r\n is affected on the one hand by desire, anger and so\nforth and\non the other=\r\n by inner and outer control, peace of the mind and serenity of\nthe\nsenses. =\r\nThe presence of the former affections and the absence of the latter\nlead to=\r\n\nmisery.\n\nSource: http://www.celextel.org/othervedantabooks/panchadasi.html=\r\n\n\n-- \n=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=\r\n=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=\r\n=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=\r\n=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=\r\n=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--00163630f585c93d1204a517dea1\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Translated by Swami Swahananda =\r\nPublished by Sri Ramakrishna Math, Chennai&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;222.
