(Even if at the \n=\r\n&gt; different plane of existence) or the people\n&gt; &gt; who criticize are right w=\r\nhen they say that \n&gt; yours is a full of stories which are\n&gt; &gt; only mytholog=\r\nical and you pray those imaginary \n&gt; Gods which are nothing\n&gt; &gt; but charact=\r\ners of Stories of some \n&gt; writer.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; I could not answer the question =\r\nas i was not \n&gt; sure.\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; This somehow reminds of a question posed by B=\r\nalaram Basu to \n&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. According to Ramakrishna&#39;s divin=\r\ne vision, Balaram Basu \n&gt; belonged in a previous birth to the inner circle =\r\nof Chaitanya Mahaprabhu! \n&gt; Balaram Basu was very devout and pious, did man=\r\ny \n&gt; austerities and spent many years serving saints at Puri, away from his=\r\n hometown \n&gt; of Calcutta. Yet, he had his doubts on the existence of god.\n&gt;=\r\n=A0 \n&gt; When he met Ramakrishna for the first time, he sat \n&gt; in a corner an=\r\nd listened to Ramakrishna&#39;s words. When other people in the room \n&gt; left, R=\r\namakrishna turned to Balaram and asked him, &quot;Is there anything you want \n&gt; =\r\nto ask me?&quot;\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; Balaram asked, &quot;Yes, sir. Does God really exist?&quot; \n&gt; Ra=\r\nmakrishna answered, &quot;Certainly He does.&quot; Balaram asked, &quot;Can a person see H=\r\nim?&quot;\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; Ramakrishna said, &quot;Yes, He reveals Himself to the \n&gt; devotee w=\r\nho thinks of Him as his nearest and dearest. Because you do not get any \n&gt; =\r\nresponse by praying to Him once, you must not conclude that He does not \n&gt; =\r\nexist.&quot;\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; Balaram asked, &quot;But why can&#39;t I see Him when I pray \n&gt; to H=\r\nim so much?&quot;\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; Ramakrishna smiled and asked, &quot;Do you really \n&gt; consid=\r\ner Him to be as dear to your heart as your own children?&quot;\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; &quot;No, sir&quot;=\r\n, Balaram candidly answered, &quot;I never felt \n&gt; that strongly for Him.&quot;\n&gt;=A0 =\r\n\n&gt; Ramakrishna then said in a sweet, convincing voice: \n&gt; &quot;Pray to God, thi=\r\nnking of Him as dearer than your own self. Truly I tell you, He \n&gt; is extre=\r\nmely fond of His devotees. He cannot but reveal Himself to them. He \n&gt; come=\r\ns to a person even before He is sought. If a person comes one step towards =\r\n\n&gt; God, God comes ten steps towards that person. There is none more intimat=\r\ne and \n&gt; more affectionate than God.&quot;\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 \n&gt; *=A0 =A0 =\r\n=A0 =A0 *\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; As Ramakrishna once said, one needs to think of god \n&gt; mo=\r\nre than one thinks about parents, wife, children and about oneself, all put=\r\n \n&gt; together. Try to do that. Then you will find the answer to your questio=\r\nn \n&gt; yourself. A theoretical answer is useless. The proof of the pudding is=\r\n in *your* \n&gt; eating it. If somebody else tells you that the pudding exists=\r\n and one can eat \n&gt; it, that information has very limited use. In order to =\r\nconvince yourself fully, \n&gt; you need to taste the pudding yourself!\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt;=\r\n Though all gods and their stories are maya from a \n&gt; strictly vedantic poi=\r\nnt of view, they are as much real as your own mind. If your \n&gt; mind is real=\r\n, all gods and their stories are real. When mind is in various \n&gt; planes of=\r\n awareness, it is possible for the mind to become aware of gods and \n&gt; thei=\r\nr plays.\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 \n&gt; *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; In this con=\r\ntext, I want to mention a small story. \n&gt; Manish was approached by a Christ=\r\nian missionary in UK once. He asked Manish if \n&gt; he was a Hindu. Then he to=\r\nld Manish about how Jesus Christ is the son of the \n&gt; real god, how Hindus =\r\nare praying to unreal and wrong gods and hence doomed and \n&gt; how followers =\r\nof Jesus Christ will go o heaven, etc. Manish asked the person, \n&gt; &quot;have yo=\r\nu seen god or Jesus Christ&quot;. The person was perplexed and said no.. \n&gt; Mani=\r\nsh asked him &quot;how do you then know that what you say is true? Are you sure =\r\n\n&gt; that you guys have understood Jesus Christ correctly and not misrepresen=\r\nting his \n&gt; teachings now?&quot; Then he mentioned calmly and confidently, &quot;Actu=\r\nally, I \n&gt; have seen Jesus Christ. If you want, I can show him to you too. =\r\nDo you \n&gt; want to see him?&quot; The missionary looked at him like a crazy perso=\r\nn and simply \n&gt; ran away.\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; See, one who is waxing eloquent about rea=\r\nl god, son \n&gt; of god and heaven does not even think that it is possible for=\r\n someone \n&gt; to see Jesus Christ. When he was told that somebody saw Jesus a=\r\nnd asked if he \n&gt; was interested in seeing, he thought the other person mus=\r\nt be crazy and \n&gt; just ran away! He wasn&#39;t even curious to pursue further a=\r\nnd see what the \n&gt; other person was upto. He simply concluded the other per=\r\nson is \n&gt; crazy!\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; People these days, in many religions, have no \n&gt; f=\r\naith. Even things that are quite possible seem impossible to people of \n&gt; t=\r\nhis age.\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 \n&gt; *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; Those who h=\r\nave seen the movie &quot;Lage Raho Munnabhai&quot; \n&gt; may recall how Sanjay Dutt star=\r\nts getting visions of Gandhi. He sees and hears \n&gt; Gandhi while others cann=\r\not. It is concluded at the end that the visions of \n&gt; Gandhi were hallucina=\r\ntions caused by the attachment of the stressed out mind to \n&gt; Gandhi and re=\r\nsulting chemical imbalance in the brain.\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; Loosely speaking, one may =\r\nsay that seeing gods is \n&gt; similar. But the difference is that it is far mo=\r\nre blissful. For another \n&gt; big difference, see the example:\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; http:/=\r\n/groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; God can be experie=\r\nnced as light, as sound or as a \n&gt; specific form similar to a human form, e=\r\ntc. In the above example, one goddess \n&gt; was experienced as sound. It can c=\r\nertainly be a hallucination, but the \n&gt; interesting thing is that another p=\r\nerson had the same experience and he knew \n&gt; that this first person had tha=\r\nt experience!\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 \n&gt; *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; I will=\r\n give another similar example. One person who \n&gt; does Chandi homam everyday=\r\n called Lord Rama in fire after Chandi homam on a Sri \n&gt; Rama Navami mornin=\r\ng and did a homam to Lord Rama. In the night, he made some \n&gt; preparations =\r\nfor the next day&#39;s homam (like he would do every night) and laid \n&gt; out som=\r\ne dried coconut pieces in homa kundam, on top of previous day&#39;s burnt \n&gt; as=\r\nhes, for starting fire on the next morning. He then went to sleep. In the \n=\r\n&gt; middle of the night, he woke up. He became aware of his body lying on the=\r\n bed. \n&gt; He then became aware of the homa kundam which was a few feet away =\r\non another \n&gt; floor. It felt like his body and homa kundam were linked. The=\r\nn it felt like \n&gt; suddenly there was fire in homa kundam and, at the same t=\r\nime, his energy rose. \n&gt; As soon as that happened, he lost regular awarenes=\r\ns of his body. He no \n&gt; longer felt his body or homa kundam or energy in th=\r\ne body. He first felt like he \n&gt; lied with head down and legs up and then h=\r\ne became absolutely weightless. Then \n&gt; he felt like he was a small point, =\r\na small particle. It felt like Lord Hanuman \n&gt; pulled him up and he went ve=\r\nry fast into a region filled with bright light. He \n&gt; was a weightless part=\r\nicle floating in that light along with Lord Hanuman and \n&gt; nobody else. He,=\r\n the small particle, started praying to Lord Hanuman and \n&gt; remained in a b=\r\nlissful state for a while.\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; Suddenly, from somewhere, a thought came=\r\n about his \n&gt; body being in a bedroom and fire in homa kundam. He wondered,=\r\n &quot;was there fire in \n&gt; homa kundam really?&quot; This disturbed his state and hi=\r\ns regular self-awareness \n&gt; (i.e.. being aware of self as a body) returned.=\r\n\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; The interesting thing is this. When he went to his \n&gt; homa kundam =\r\nto do homam next morning, he saw that the dried coconut pieces \n&gt; placed th=\r\nere on the ashes previous night were burnt and completely black. \n&gt; It mean=\r\ns there was indeed a fire in the homa kundam. He used the same \n&gt; procedure=\r\n everyday and placed coconut pieces on the ashes for the next day&#39;s \n&gt; homa=\r\nm before sleeping, but such a thing never happened. Basically, there must \n=\r\n&gt; have been some ember left still from the previous morning, though he did =\r\nnot see \n&gt; any ember in the night and thought the fire went out completely.=\r\n For some \n&gt; reason, that unseen ember started up a small fire in the night=\r\n and the coconut \n&gt; pieces caught fire. Though there is no way to know when=\r\n that happened, it is \n&gt; consistent with what he felt during the mystical e=\r\nxperience! After daily homam \n&gt; for a long time, a relationship formed betw=\r\neen him and the homa kundam. \n&gt; Moreover, the ember left in homa kundam con=\r\ntinued to be linked to his internal \n&gt; fire and developments related to it =\r\nstill affected his internal fire and \n&gt; consciousness!\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; When you do =\r\nhomam for a long time with the mental \n&gt; visualization linking that externa=\r\nl fire to your internal fire, the relationship \n&gt; is formed over the time! =\r\nWhat happens in that external fire does then \n&gt; affect your consciousness. =\r\nEven if the fire goes and ember is left buried under \n&gt; the ash, that ember=\r\n is still linked to your internal fire!! When something \n&gt; happens in your =\r\ninternal fire, the same thing happens to the ember too. And vice \n&gt; versa.\n=\r\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 \n&gt; *=A0 =A0 =A0 =A0 *\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; Dear Utpal, one can =\r\nsee God for sure. One can \n&gt; experience God in many forms. One can see god =\r\nexternally, in a limited form like \n&gt; a human form. One can see god interna=\r\nlly, when shakti (energy of self-awareness) \n&gt; rises to a specific place an=\r\nd becomes aware of beings in that place. One can \n&gt; experience god as an al=\r\nl-pervading light or sound and experience oneself as a \n&gt; small part of tha=\r\nt light or sound. There are many ways to perceive god, but the \n&gt; bottomlin=\r\ne is that god does exist and one can perceive god. I \n&gt; cannot show you god=\r\n, but I can guarantee you that god exists and can be \n&gt; perceived in variou=\r\ns forms.\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; Do homam everyday with sincerity. That will burn \n&gt; the bl=\r\nocking karmas. Eventually you will be able to love god more than anything, =\r\n\n&gt; including yourself. That is when the final screen will start to disappea=\r\nr.. \n&gt; Nothing can be a substitute for spiritual sadhana.\n&gt;=A0 \n&gt; Best \n&gt; r=\r\negards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n\n\n\n\n------------------------------------\n\n|| Om Shaanti=\r\nh Shaantih Shaantih ||\nYahoo!

(Even if at the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; different pl=\r\nane of existence) or the\n people&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; who criticize are right when =\r\nthey say that &lt;BR&gt;&gt; yours is a full of stories which are&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; on=\r\nly mythological and you pray those imaginary &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Gods which are nothin=\r\ng&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; but characters of Stories of some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; writer.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; I could not answer the question as i was not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; sur=\r\ne.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; This somehow reminds of a question posed by Balar=\r\nam Basu to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna Paramahamsa. According to Ramakrishna&#39;s div=\r\nine vision, Balaram Basu &lt;BR&gt;&gt; belonged in a previous birth to the inner=\r\n circle of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu! &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Balaram Basu was very devout and =\r\npious, did many &lt;BR&gt;&gt; austerities and spent many years serving saints at=\r\n Puri, away from his hometown &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of Calcutta. Yet, he had his doubts =\r\non the existence of god.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When he met Ramakrishna for=\r\n the first time, he sat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; in a corner and listened to Ramakrishna&#39;s =\r\nwords. When other\n people in the room &lt;BR&gt;&gt; left, Ramakrishna turned to =\r\nBalaram and asked him, &quot;Is there anything you want &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to ask me?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Balaram asked, &quot;Yes, sir. Does God really exist?&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; Ramakrishna answered, &quot;Certainly He does.&quot; Balaram asked, &quot;Can a person=\r\n see Him?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna said, &quot;Yes, He reveals Himsel=\r\nf to the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; devotee who thinks of Him as his nearest and dearest. Bec=\r\nause you do not get any &lt;BR&gt;&gt; response by praying to Him once, you must =\r\nnot conclude that He does not &lt;BR&gt;&gt; exist.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Balar=\r\nam asked, &quot;But why can&#39;t I see Him when I pray &lt;BR&gt;&gt; to Him so much?&quot;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna smiled and asked, &quot;Do you really &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nconsider Him to be as dear to your heart as your own children?&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbs=\r\np; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;No, sir&quot;, Balaram candidly answered, &quot;I never felt &lt;BR&gt;&gt; th=\r\nat strongly for Him.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Ramakrishna then said in a swe=\r\net,\n convincing voice: &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Pray to God, thinking of Him as dearer tha=\r\nn your own self. Truly I tell you, He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is extremely fond of His dev=\r\notees. He cannot but reveal Himself to them. He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; comes to a person =\r\neven before He is sought. If a person comes one step towards &lt;BR&gt;&gt; God, =\r\nGod comes ten steps towards that person. There is none more intimate and &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; more affectionate than God.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &=\r\nnbsp; &nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n As Ramakrishna once said, one needs to think of god &lt;BR&gt;&gt; more than one=\r\n thinks about parents, wife, children and about oneself, all put &lt;BR&gt;&gt; t=\r\nogether. Try to do that. Then you will find the answer to your question &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; yourself. A theoretical answer is useless. The proof of the pudding i=\r\ns in *your* &lt;BR&gt;&gt; eating it. If somebody else tells you that the pudding=\r\n exists and one can eat &lt;BR&gt;&gt; it, that information has very limited\n use=\r\n. In order to convince yourself fully, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; you need to taste the puddi=\r\nng yourself!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Though all gods and their stories are m=\r\naya from a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; strictly vedantic point of view, they are as much real =\r\nas your own mind. If your &lt;BR&gt;&gt; mind is real, all gods and their stories=\r\n are real. When mind is in various &lt;BR&gt;&gt; planes of awareness, it is poss=\r\nible for the mind to become aware of gods and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; their plays.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;=\r\n &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; In this context, I want to mention a small=\r\n story. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Manish was approached by a Christian missionary in UK once=\r\n. He asked Manish if &lt;BR&gt;&gt; he was a Hindu. Then he told Manish about how=\r\n Jesus Christ is the son of the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; real god, how Hindus are praying t=\r\no unreal and wrong gods and hence doomed and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; how followers of Jesu=\r\ns Christ will go o heaven, etc. Manish asked the person,\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;have yo=\r\nu seen god or Jesus Christ&quot;. The person was perplexed and said no. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Manish asked him &quot;how do you then know that what you say is true? Are you =\r\nsure &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that you guys have understood Jesus Christ correctly and not =\r\nmisrepresenting his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; teachings now?&quot; Then he mentioned calmly and c=\r\nonfidently, &quot;Actually, I &lt;BR&gt;&gt; have seen Jesus Christ. If you want, I ca=\r\nn show him to you too. Do you &lt;BR&gt;&gt; want to see him?&quot; The missionary loo=\r\nked at him like a crazy person and simply &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ran away.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; See, one who is waxing eloquent about real god, son &lt;BR&gt;&gt; of go=\r\nd and heaven does not even think that it is possible for someone &lt;BR&gt;&gt; t=\r\no see Jesus Christ. When he was told that somebody saw Jesus and asked if h=\r\ne &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was interested in seeing, he thought the other person must be cr=\r\nazy and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; just ran away! He wasn&#39;t even curious to pursue further an=\r\nd see what the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; other person was upto. He\n simply concluded the oth=\r\ner person is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; crazy!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; People these days, in m=\r\nany religions, have no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; faith. Even things that are quite possible =\r\nseem impossible to people of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; this age.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nb=\r\nsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nb=\r\nsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Those who have seen the movie &quot;Lage Raho Munnabhai&quot; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; m=\r\nay recall how Sanjay Dutt starts getting visions of Gandhi. He sees and hea=\r\nrs &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Gandhi while others cannot. It is concluded at the end that the=\r\n visions of &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Gandhi were hallucinations caused by the attachment of=\r\n the stressed out mind to &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Gandhi and resulting chemical imbalance =\r\nin the brain.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Loosely speaking, one may say that see=\r\ning gods is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; similar. But the difference is that it is far more bli=\r\nssful. For another &lt;BR&gt;&gt; big difference, see the example:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;A\n href=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951=\r\n&quot; target=3D_blank&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom/message/951&lt;/A=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; God can be experienced as light, as sound or as a =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; specific form similar to a human form, etc. In the above example, =\r\none goddess &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was experienced as sound. It can certainly be a halluc=\r\nination, but the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; interesting thing is that another person had the =\r\nsame experience and he knew &lt;BR&gt;&gt; that this first person had that experi=\r\nence!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp; =\r\n&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I will give another similar e=\r\nxample. One person who &lt;BR&gt;&gt; does Chandi homam everyday called Lord Rama=\r\n in fire after Chandi homam on a Sri &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Rama Navami morning and did a=\r\n homam to Lord Rama. In the night, he made some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; preparations for t=\r\nhe next day&#39;s homam (like he would do every night) and laid &lt;BR&gt;&gt; out so=\r\nme dried\n coconut pieces in homa kundam, on top of previous day&#39;s burnt &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; ashes, for starting fire on the next morning. He then went to sleep. =\r\nIn the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; middle of the night, he woke up. He became aware of his bod=\r\ny lying on the bed. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; He then became aware of the homa kundam which =\r\nwas a few feet away on another &lt;BR&gt;&gt; floor. It felt like his body and ho=\r\nma kundam were linked. Then it felt like &lt;BR&gt;&gt; suddenly there was fire i=\r\nn homa kundam and, at the same time, his energy rose. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; As soon as t=\r\nhat happened, he lost regular awareness of his body. He no &lt;BR&gt;&gt; longer =\r\nfelt his body or homa kundam or energy in the body. He first felt like he &lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; lied with head down and legs up and then he became absolutely weigh=\r\ntless. Then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; he felt like he was a small point, a small particle. I=\r\nt felt like Lord Hanuman &lt;BR&gt;&gt; pulled him up and he went very fast into =\r\na region filled with bright light. He &lt;BR&gt;&gt; was a weightless particle\n f=\r\nloating in that light along with Lord Hanuman and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; nobody else. He,=\r\n the small particle, started praying to Lord Hanuman and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; remained =\r\nin a blissful state for a while.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Suddenly, from some=\r\nwhere, a thought came about his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; body being in a bedroom and fire i=\r\nn homa kundam. He wondered, &quot;was there fire in &lt;BR&gt;&gt; homa kundam really?=\r\n&quot; This disturbed his state and his regular self-awareness &lt;BR&gt;&gt; (i.e.. b=\r\neing aware of self as a body) returned.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The interest=\r\ning thing is this. When he went to his &lt;BR&gt;&gt; homa kundam to do homam nex=\r\nt morning, he saw that the dried coconut pieces &lt;BR&gt;&gt; placed there on th=\r\ne ashes previous night were burnt and completely black. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It means t=\r\nhere was indeed a fire in the homa kundam. He used the same &lt;BR&gt;&gt; proced=\r\nure everyday and placed coconut pieces on the ashes for the next day&#39;s &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; homam before sleeping, but such a thing never happened.\n Basically, th=\r\nere must &lt;BR&gt;&gt; have been some ember left still from the previous morning=\r\n, though he did not see &lt;BR&gt;&gt; any ember in the night and thought the fir=\r\ne went out completely. For some &lt;BR&gt;&gt; reason, that unseen ember started =\r\nup a small fire in the night and the coconut &lt;BR&gt;&gt; pieces caught fire. T=\r\nhough there is no way to know when that happened, it is &lt;BR&gt;&gt; consistent=\r\n with what he felt during the mystical experience! After daily homam &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; for a long time, a relationship formed between him and the homa kundam. =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Moreover, the ember left in homa kundam continued to be linked to =\r\nhis internal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; fire and developments related to it still affected hi=\r\ns internal fire and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; consciousness!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; When you=\r\n do homam for a long time with the mental &lt;BR&gt;&gt; visualization linking th=\r\nat external fire to your internal fire, the relationship &lt;BR&gt;&gt; is formed=\r\n over the time! What happens in that external fire\n does then &lt;BR&gt;&gt; affe=\r\nct your consciousness. Even if the fire goes and ember is left buried under=\r\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the ash, that ember is still linked to your internal fire!! When =\r\nsomething &lt;BR&gt;&gt; happens in your internal fire, the same thing happens to=\r\n the ember too. And vice &lt;BR&gt;&gt; versa.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp; &nb=\r\nsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; Dear Utpal, one can see God for sure. One can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; experience God=\r\n in many forms. One can see god externally, in a limited form like &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n a human form. One can see god internally, when shakti (energy of self-awar=\r\neness) &lt;BR&gt;&gt; rises to a specific place and becomes aware of beings in th=\r\nat place. One can &lt;BR&gt;&gt; experience god as an all-pervading light or soun=\r\nd and experience oneself as a &lt;BR&gt;&gt; small part of that light or sound. T=\r\nhere are many ways to perceive god, but the &lt;BR&gt;&gt; bottomline is that god=\r\n does exist and one can perceive god. I\n &lt;BR&gt;&gt; cannot show you god, but =\r\nI can guarantee you that god exists and can be &lt;BR&gt;&gt; perceived in variou=\r\ns forms.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Do homam everyday with sincerity. That will=\r\n burn &lt;BR&gt;&gt; the blocking karmas. Eventually you will be able to love god=\r\n more than anything, &lt;BR&gt;&gt; including yourself. That is when the final sc=\r\nreen will start to disappear. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Nothing can be a substitute for spir=\r\nitual sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best &lt;BR&gt;&gt; regards,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasi=\r\nmha&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------------------------------&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;|| Om Sh=\r\naantih Shaantih Shaantih ||&lt;BR&gt;Yahoo!
