I will reply to them together.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRegarding mail 1 below on priests:\n \nDoing rituals for one&#39;s own upliftment is one thing and doing it for others is another. In the former, one is cleaning up a dirty place that one is forced to live in. In the latter, one is going to someone else&#39;s dirty place and cleaning it up. If there is some radioactive waste there and one is not protected, one may be affected.\n \nAs I keep saying, results of one&#39;s previous karmas are like fruits lying in a basket. One takes out one fruit after another and eats them. Some may be tasty and some may be bitter or rotten. When one does rituals and other spiritual sadhana, the deities throw away some bad fruits into a trash can and make one eat good fruits earlier than otherwise. But there may be some spillage as dirty fruits are thrown away. If a priest is conducting the ritual, he may be affected by the spillage.\n \nIn the old days, priests did intense sadhana and generated enough purity to handle such things. Many priests of today do not do enough penance. They are quite vulnerable as they start messing with other people&#39;s karmas.\n \nSecondly, many priests of today who conduct poojas are not really brahmanas. Being born to a brahmana father is neither necessary nor sufficient for one to become a brahmana oneself. One&#39;s aptitude, attitude and actions have to be brahmana-like. Many brahmanas today think of power and influence over others or of money or of comforts. They are not thinking just of knowledge and liberation. They are not really brahmanas. In fact, there are very very few brahmanas on earth right now. Shastras are clear that rituals can be performed for others only by brahmanas. What it means is that one desirous of power, influence, money and comforts is unfit to perform rituals for others.\n \n&gt; is there any remedy for this?\n \nWell, stop doing rituals for others. Or, do enough individual penance when you are not doing rituals for others. Moreover, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming the tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas.\n \n*        *        *\n \nRegarding mail 2 below on astrologers:\n \nThis is not an immature comment and there is an element of truth in it. A lot of what I said above applies here too.\n \nEvery action performed with ego (a sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;) produces an equal reaction. If an astrologer&#39;s action of giving advice to someone resulted in that person doing X instead of Y at kaarmik crossroads and experiencing Z instead of W in coming years, there is clearly an action here. If the astrologer has some sense of &quot;I am doing this&quot;, then one is bound to experience the fruits of it. Some blessings can come and some sufferings can come too.\n \nMessing with someone else&#39;s karmas is always a risky business.\n \nWhat is the solution? Well, become a true brahmana. Again, try to follow a brahmana lifestyle described in Srimad Bhagavatam chapter 11.17 and aspire to truly become a brahmana by overcoming tendencies of chandalas, shudras, kshatriyas and vaisyas. Irrespective of where one was born and brought up, one will become a brahmana if one follows this. Only brahmanas are qualified to play with the karmas of others by giving life-altering advice or by conducting rituals. Again, to be clear, I am not talking about brahmanas by birth, but about brahmanas by conduct.\n \nThe above will become clear, if you look at the criteria laid about by Parasara, Varahamihira etc on who can be taught Jyotish!\n \nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish MP3 Lessons, Free Jyotish textbook,\nFree &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpana:\n                    http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n       Films that make a difference: http://SaraswatiFilms.org\n       Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n    Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritings\n-----------------------------------------------------------------------\n \nMail 1:\n \n---- &quot;aksha.rudra&quot; &lt;aksha.rudra@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Are present Brahmanas suffering from any curse(Shapam)?\n&gt; This I am asking after seeing the overall and general condition of Brahmanas specially those who do pujas for Yajmanas and involved in Karmakanda.\n&gt; And if this is true is there any remedy for this?\n&gt; I think this is the only place where we can discuss this subject hence I am posting this query here.Thanks a lot in advance.\n \nMail 2:\n \n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;rl_yhoo&quot; &lt;rl_yhoo@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; Namaste Narasimhaji and other educated Scholars,\n&gt; \n&gt; I have just started listening to your (Narasimhaji&#39;s) mp3 training sessions and am very eager to review my own chart. \n&gt; \n&gt; However in numerous instances in the past, I&#39;ve heard through friends and close uncles that astrology can have a severe adverse impact on yourself (astrologer) and yrou family. This may sound a very immature comment, but I thought I should get your opinion / thoughts on this before I proceed on this journey.\n&gt; \n&gt; I would appreciate getting a honest response so I can put this issue to rest once and for all. \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Raj\n&gt; \n&gt; PS: I am drawn to astology more from an academic perspective of how it influences our life and how ignorant we are of this power around us. My goal is to get the little understanding that I can of this marvelous science and educate our next generation so they are not blinded by modern society and develop / retain respect for astrology and our culture.\n&gt;\n\n\n"}}
