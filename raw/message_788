I was there myself in February 1967\n&gt; on the way to Ceylon, from where I went back to\n&gt; France by ship with my wife. In the meantime a\n&gt; Vivekananda memorial has been built there, but you\n&gt; do not mention it at all. I do not remember that I\n&gt; have seen any coelenterates there. May be this is a\n&gt; new attraction. \n&gt; Regarding the date of Rama&#39;s life you state a wrong\n&gt; number, but even if it would be alright, it would\n&gt; not be possible for the human mind to keep the\n&gt; memory thereof. It was already too much for the\n&gt; brahmins to remember the Indus culture, in spite of\n&gt; their admirable memorizing capacity.\n&gt; In the meantime I have revised and enlarged my\n&gt; report on the Orlando conference, which I enclose\n&gt; again. Did you send the former version to Deen and\n&gt; the other friends? I have promised to do so to some\n&gt; of them. \n&gt; I have still not received the book on Invading the\n&gt; sacred, for which I have paid 10 $. Could you give\n&gt; me the email address of Aditi, so that I can write\n&gt; to her directly?\n&gt; I wish you all the best for the next years in spite\n&gt; of the economic turbulences.\n&gt; \n&gt; Egbert\n&gt;   ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt;   From: venkata krishnan \n&gt;   To: vedichistory@yahoogroups.com ;\n&gt; BCVENKATAKRISHNANNewsListgroup ; kishore patnaik ;\n&gt; oddisilab1@... \n&gt;   Sent: Thursday, November 06, 2008 10:59 AM\n&gt;   Subject: [vedichistory] My Pilgrimage in July\n&gt; 2007.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;         Date: 23-8-2007. \n&gt; \n&gt;         My Pilgrimage in July 2007. \n&gt; \n&gt;         By B.C.VENKATAKRISHNAN.\n&gt; \n&gt;         My family and I boarded the train in Chennai\n&gt; on 24th July 2007 and reached Thoothukkudi on 25th\n&gt; morning .Our family friends came in a travel car and\n&gt; picked us up and reached the Collector�s bungalow.\n&gt; We stayed in the Collector�s Bungalow there.\n&gt; Thoothukkudi Collectors Bungalow is the biggest and\n&gt; most beautiful Collector�s Bungalow in Tamilnadu\n&gt; State. It is on the shore of Bay of Bengal. The\n&gt; bungalow is so close to the sea that we touched the\n&gt; sea from the corridor of the bungalow with our\n&gt; hands. The bungalow has a large garden. The waves of\n&gt; the sea banged on the compound wall of the bungalow.\n&gt; There are a couple of islands in that sea, which are\n&gt; clearly visible from the bungalow. Boats are\n&gt; available from the bungalow to travel to the nearby\n&gt; islands. The scenery is wonderful. The BritishRaj\n&gt; built the bungalow. Earlier, on the previous day\n&gt; morning I became sick vomiting couple of times at\n&gt; home, we were to abandon the tour but, I insisted to\n&gt; go as planned before and started our tour. I also\n&gt; had fever I was under medication. The everyone were\n&gt; worried about my health. The Collector,\n&gt; Mr.Pazhaniandi, is a friendly gentleman. He took\n&gt; care of our needs very well. I just had homemade\n&gt; coffee with all the vessels, stove cooking gas\n&gt; cylinder etc. And my coffee was prepared with those\n&gt; vessels and stove. Others had their breakfast made\n&gt; by the Collector�s cook. The Collector sent the\n&gt; Peshkar of Temples with us. Then we started in our\n&gt; car from the bungalow and went to all Temples in\n&gt; Thoothukkudi and had good Darshan of all the Gods\n&gt; and reached back to bungalow. We started from\n&gt; Thoothukkudi at 7-00 PM and reached Rameswaram by\n&gt; our car in the midnight at 1-00 AM on 26th July via\n&gt; Pamban Bridge.\n&gt;         The Deputy Commissioner of HR&C Department\n&gt; of Tamilnadu, Mr.Azhagarswamy a family friend of\n&gt; ours was contacting us through phone while we were\n&gt; travelling to Rameswaram and enquired about our\n&gt; plans. When we reached Rameswaram he was readily\n&gt; waiting for us in the midnight and received us and\n&gt; took us to the guesthouse. In the famous Lord\n&gt; Sankara Temple in Rameswaram Paalaabhishekam,\n&gt; meaning pouring Milk, of the Spatikalingam is\n&gt; conducted everyday at 4-30 AM. So, we all left the\n&gt; guesthouse and went to Lord Sankara Temple and\n&gt; witnessed the Paalaabishekam of the Spatikalingam.\n&gt; That Spatikalingam was installed and worshipped by\n&gt; Lord RAAMA to get rid of the BRAHMAHATIDOSHAM after\n&gt; killing Ravana in LANKA and got rid of the\n&gt; Brahmahatidosham. Aachaaryas advice that one has to\n&gt; go to Kaasi and Rameswaram and take bath in the holy\n&gt; waters at least once the lifetime. Rameswaram is\n&gt; important among the Holy Theertas. If one bathes in\n&gt; River Ganges in Kaasi one will attain Moksha. If one\n&gt; bathes in the holy Theertas in Rameswaram one will\n&gt; obtain wealth and one will be liberated from the\n&gt; Doshas. Agni Theerta is the most important among the\n&gt; Theertas in Rameswaram. Lord Rama took bath in Agni\n&gt; Theerta and installed the Rudra Linga of Lord\n&gt; Sankara and worshipped him. When Goddess Sita\n&gt; entered the Agni and proved her chastity, to get\n&gt; liberated from the sin of it Agnideva took bath in\n&gt; this Theerta. Hence it got the name Agni Theerta. \n&gt;         The Bay of Bengal, which is the Agni\n&gt; Theerta, in front of Lord Sankara Temple, in\n&gt; Rameswaram, is always hot. Since Varunadeva did not\n&gt; appear, when Lord Rama chanted the Varunamantra,\n&gt; this is the place in the sea where the Agnisastra\n&gt; fell which was shot by Lord Rama. Herbs, conch,\n&gt; corals rise on the surface of the sea on New moon,\n&gt; Full moon, Ashtami and Navami days when there are\n&gt; high tides. Agni Theertam is considered equal to\n&gt; Amrta on these days. One�s body will absorb the\n&gt; nutrients if one takes bath in Agni Theertam on\n&gt; these days due to which one is cured of diseases and\n&gt; liberated from sins according to Sastras. This has\n&gt; also been proved in modern science. One should not\n&gt; bathe in the sea at all times. Those who want to\n&gt; beget children, to get rid of Doshas and those who\n&gt; want to perform Pariharas should not take bath on\n&gt; Tuesdays, Fridays and Sundays in the Theertas.\n&gt; According to Sethu Mahathmiyam, one can take bath in\n&gt; Agni Theertam Sethu Sea on all days and all times.\n&gt; If one bathes in Agni Theertam one will derive the\n&gt; benefits if one takes bath in Ganges. It is believed\n&gt; that if those who want to beget children bathe in\n&gt; Agni Theertam will beget children. If one bathes in\n&gt; Agni Theertam one will get rid of the Doshas due to\n&gt; Grahas. If one does Parihara those who have\n&gt; Nagadosha will get rid of it and those who have\n&gt; Putradosha and Pitrudosha will get rid of them. \n&gt;         From Lord Sankara Temple, we all went to\n&gt; Lord Rama Temple in Rameswaram. Lord Rama Temple is\n&gt; an ancient temple. When Danushkoti submerged under\n&gt; the Bay of Bengal in 1964, the Lord Rama Temple too\n&gt; submerged during tsunami but, the Lord Rama Temple\n&gt; has been reclaimed later immediately but it has been\n&gt; buried under the land. The land was dug and the\n&gt; original Lord Rama Temple parts, the Vigrahas were\n&gt; excavated and the new temple was built in 1974 and\n&gt; the Vigrahas were installed. The traveler�s room\n&gt; where the Pilgrims used to stay is half buried.\n&gt;         The height of the original traveler�s room,\n&gt; which is part of the ancient temple, was 15 feet but\n&gt; after it got buried at present it is only 7 feet.\n&gt; There is still a Peeta where Lord Rama and other\n&gt; Vigrahas used to be placed. Ramanujaacharya\n&gt; renovated this Temple and worshipped Lord Rama here.\n&gt; There is also a Vigraha and separate Sannidhi for\n&gt; Ramanujaacharya in this Temple. We had the Darshan\n&gt; of the Lord there. Modern Srilanka is 18 kms from\n&gt; that Lord Rama Temple which is on the seashore. \n&gt;         From there we went to the Temple where there\n&gt; is Lord Rama�s Padam \n&gt;         Kandamaadanam hill. This is the place from\n&gt; where Lord Rama and Vanaras planned the route to lay\n&gt; the Sethu Bridge. We had the Darshan of the Lord\n&gt; Rama�s Padam and went to Lord Rama Theertam where\n&gt; Lord Rama took bath. On the bank of the Tank of the\n&gt; Lord Rama Temple, 2 people placed Coelenterates in a\n&gt; vessel and collecting Rs.2/= per person to view the\n&gt; floating Coelenterates in the water. We had the\n&gt; Darshan of Lord Rama and from there went to Goddess\n&gt; Sita Theerta and Lord Lakshmana Theerta. From there\n&gt; we went to the Mutt of Tulasidas and had the Darshan\n&gt; of the Lord Rama. The Archakas and the followers of\n&gt; Tulasidas were selling Coelenterates and claiming\n&gt; those to be the floating stones which were those\n&gt; from the Sethu Bridge laid by Lord Rama and Vanaras\n&gt; and demanded Rs. 1,000/= per Coelenterate and all\n&gt; these are commercialized. In fact Lord Rama and\n&gt; Vanaras laid the Sethu Bridge from Danushkoti to\n&gt; legendary Lanka of Ravana using Coelenterates. The\n&gt; Coelenterates have innumerable pores through which\n&gt; they absorb water hence they float in water. In\n&gt; large Coelenterates humans can walk, run or stand.\n&gt; Lord Rama and Vanaras walked on the Sethu Bridge\n&gt; made up of Large Coelenterates to Lanka. After the\n&gt; passage of time these Coelenterates grew big and due\n&gt; to their weight the Coelenterates in the Bridge sank\n&gt; under the sea, which still exist under the sea.\n&gt; Ramayana took place in the fag end of Dretayuga and\n&gt; the beginning of Dwaparayuga of the current Mahayuga\n&gt; approx. 17,80,000 Human years before. And this is\n&gt; certainly long period for the Sethu Bridge made up\n&gt; of Coelenterates to grow hefty enough to submerge\n&gt; under the sea. This is proved science. From there we\n&gt; all went to Former President of INDIA,\n&gt; Dr.A.P.J.Abdulkalam�s residence but none was there\n&gt; and the house door was locked hence, we left\n&gt; Rameswaram in the evening and reached Tirupullani\n&gt; Lord Rama�s Temple and had the Darshan of the Lord.\n&gt; Emperor Dasaratha made Putrakameshti Yaga in\n&gt; Tirupullani and begot 4 sons who were the\n&gt; personification of Four Vedas, Lord Rama, Lord\n&gt; Bharata, Lord Lakshmana and Lord Satrugna.
