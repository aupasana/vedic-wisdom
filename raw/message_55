Questioning \nthe reason for our human existence is a very natural pu=\r\nrsuit on the \npart of any human being.  Indeed, unlike any other species of=\r\n life, \nhuman beings alone have been gifted by God with the unique cognitiv=\r\ne \nability to engage in self-reflection upon our very own existence as \nhum=\r\nan beings.  To be human means to question what it means to be \nhuman.  \n\nIt=\r\n is especially when such existential questions arise in our minds \nthat we =\r\nfind ourselves understandably turning to the precise fields \nof knowledge t=\r\nhat deal most directly with such questions: the sister \nfields of religion =\r\nand philosophy.  In the following, I will answer \nthis universal query from=\r\n the perspective of the most ancient religio-\nphilosophical system on earth=\r\n, Sanatana Dharma.\n\nThe nature of existence has been dealt with by many phi=\r\nlosophers, \nboth Western and Asian, from the beginning of time.  Whether we=\r\n are \nspeaking of Thomas Aquinas and his metaphysical distinction of \nexist=\r\nence and essence, Soren Kierkegaard and his attempts to come to \ngrips with=\r\n the problem of existence from a Protestant perspective, \nthe Existentialis=\r\nts of the 20th Century, or the Samkhya and Vedanta \nschools of Sanatana Dha=\r\nrma, the nature of our existence has been on \nthe minds of some of history&#39;=\r\ns greatest thinkers.  \n\nThe most basic of all philosophical questions that =\r\ncan be asked is: \nWhy do human beings exist?  When I open my eyes in the mo=\r\nrning, why \nis it that there is something rather than nothing?  In order to=\r\n \nsufficiently analyze this question, the question itself really needs \nto =\r\nbe divided into two closely related questions:  a) why do we exist \nat all,=\r\n b) why do we exist as human beings.  I&#39;ll try to answer both \nfrom the per=\r\nspective of Yoga spirituality and Sanatana Dharma.\n\nAccording to the ancien=\r\nt wisdom of Dharma, we exist to begin with \nbecause it&#39;s our very innate na=\r\nture to exist.  The sacred scriptures \nof both Yoga and Sanatana Dharma tea=\r\nch us that our true, innermost \nnature is that we are atman, or eternal uni=\r\nts of consciousness.  We \nhave the Absolute (Brahman, or God) as both our c=\r\nausative and \nsubstantial source, and as the ontological sustainer of our \n=\r\nexistential being.  Having God as our underlying source, it \nnecessarily fo=\r\nllows that we naturally share in many of God&#39;s \nessential attributive quali=\r\nties.  Because we participate in God&#39;s \ninnate attributes - and if not to a=\r\n quantitatively equivalent degree, \nthen certainly to a qualitative one - w=\r\ne too share in many of God&#39;s \nqualities.  One of those attributes that both=\r\n God and we have in \ncommon is necessary existence.  In other words, both G=\r\nod and we \nourselves (atmans, or souls) are eternal by our inherent nature.=\r\n  God \nand individual atmans cannot but exist.  To go out of existence is \n=\r\nsimply not within the realm of our capability.  \n\nNever was there a time wh=\r\nen we came into being, and never will there \nbe a time when we cease to exi=\r\nst.  So, in a way, we exist because we \ncannot but exist, being purely spir=\r\nitual beings in essence.  Such is \nour nature, for it is the nature of God,=\r\n the ultimate source of our \nbeing.  \n\nA deeper question than the principle=\r\n of necessary existence, however, \nis: why is it the case that we were even=\r\n gifted with necessary \nexistence to begin with?  Sanatana Dharma answers t=\r\nhis in the \nfollowing manner.  Brahman (God) is One (ekam).  But as a natur=\r\nal \nresult of the overflowing abundance of the Infinite, God decides to \nbe=\r\ncome more than One.  God thus becomes One-with-attributes \n(vishishta-advai=\r\nta).  Consequently, in addition to Brahman, we also \nhave atman (individual=\r\n selves) and jagat (materiality).  As atman, we \nhave our own individual ex=\r\nistence in attributive relationship with \nBrahman (God) in order to know, a=\r\nnd love, and serve Brahman.  \n\nThe second part of our question on human exi=\r\nstence =96 &quot;why do we exist \nas human beings?&quot; =96 can then be understood f=\r\nrom understanding the \nfirst part.  As beings who partake in God&#39;s necessar=\r\ny existence and \nattributive nature, we are currently in a state of self-im=\r\nposed \nseparation from God due to our self-destructive fascination with ego=\r\n \nand the objects of ego.  It is ego, and the subsequent selfishness \nand s=\r\nelf-centeredness that result from ego, that produce the various \nlayers of =\r\nillusory self that we mistakenly identify with our true, \nspiritual identit=\r\ny.  \n\nThe &quot;human person&quot; is in actuality a complex symbiosis comprised of \n=\r\nseveral distinct aggregates, including physical body (deha), mind \nsubstanc=\r\ne, (manas), intellect (buddhi), ego (ahamkara), the vital \nforce (prana), a=\r\nnd ultimately atman as the source of consciousness \nand animating source.  =\r\nWhile the &quot;human person&quot; is an artificial and \ntemporal construct comprised=\r\n of these many elements, it is the atman \nalone that is the true self, and =\r\nthat is eternal, true, beautiful, \nindestructible, and blissful by its own =\r\ninherent nature, having God \n(Brahman) as its source of being.  \n\nWe thus f=\r\nind ourselves in human form (and sometimes other forms!) in \nan endlessly u=\r\nnsuccessful attempt to selfishly enjoy ourselves in the \nillusion that we c=\r\nan have a meaningful existence without the benefit \nof God&#39;s love.  We are =\r\nidentifying with the temporal instead of the \neternal, with the shallow ins=\r\ntead of the profound, with the material \ninstead of the spiritual, with the=\r\n illusory instead of the real.  \n\nThe meaning of life in human form is to t=\r\nhus reverse this negative \nand self-defeating tendency to serve our ego, an=\r\nd to instead once \nagain serve God.  We are here, as human beings, to trans=\r\ncend our \nmerely human nature, to re-embrace our true identity as eternal \n=\r\nspiritual beings, and to partake of the Divine nature that is our \nbirthrig=\r\nht, that is our natural state of being, and that is our true \nhome.  We are=\r\n here to know, and to love, and to serve the Divine.  \n\nIn Sanatana Dharma,=\r\n God is presented as the source of all goodness, \nacceptance, compassion, a=\r\nnd non-judgmental love.  God is embraced and \nloved without restrictions, w=\r\nithout fear, without force, and without \nloss.  This is a very different co=\r\nnception of the Absolute when \ncompared to the notion we find in the Wester=\r\nn, Abrahamic religious \nconstructs of Judaism, Christianity and Islam.  Unl=\r\nike in the \nAbrahamic religions, in Sanatana Dharma we find a concept of Go=\r\nd as \nnot only being a thoroughly transcendent source of reality, but also =\r\n\nas a lovingly imminent and intimate friend who provides us all with a \nmea=\r\nns for achieving immediate knowledge, and a direct and ecstatic \nexperience=\r\n of Him.  \n\nThe path of Sanatana Dharma offers us such profoundly philosoph=\r\nical \nworks as the Bhagavad Gita, Upanishads, and Vedas for the unfailing \n=\r\nguidance and knowledge necessary to comprehend life&#39;s meaning.  It \nalso of=\r\nfers us a systematic path of spiritual practice that leads \ndirectly to a p=\r\nersonal experience of the Divine.  This path includes \nthe ancient and high=\r\nly effective processes of Yoga, meditation, puja, \nand devotion to God.  \n\n=\r\nTo truly know the answer to the meaning of human life, however, it is \nnot =\r\nenough ultimately to merely engage in an intellectual \nunderstanding of Tru=\r\nth.  Rather, we need to personally experience the \nsweet taste of Truth as =\r\nthe immediate presence of God in our hearts \nand in our lives.  To experien=\r\nce the profound bliss of God&#39;s presence \nin your life, and to truly know wh=\r\ny we have the joy of existence, \nplease explore the profound depths of spir=\r\nitual realization that \nSanatana Dharma has to offer you.  To be human is t=\r\no ask.  \n\n\n\nThe Author:\n\nDr. Frank Morales, Ph.D. (Sri Dharma Pravartaka Ac=\r\nharya) is an \nAmerican who has been practicing Sanatana Dharma for over 30 =\r\nyears. \nHe has a Ph.D. in Religious Studies and is recognized by the global=\r\n \nHindu community as one of the leading Hindu Acharyas (Spiritual \nPrecepto=\r\nrs) in the nation.
