If this specific pre-occupation minimized many other (and worse) \npre-occupations, it is not a bad thing at all.\n\nIt is like a monkey that keeps jumping from one place to another place being \ntied to a pole with a chain to limit its jumping. The monkey may still be \njumping up and down, but the chain atleast *limits* its movement around one \npole.\n\nOf course, if the monkey learns to stay in one place without jumping, it \nneeds no chain or pole anymore. Chain was there in the first place to limit \nits jumping.\n\nEach person is the best judge of where one is and what is appropriate for \noneself. We make progress by recognizing our weaknesses and addressing them.\n\nIn addition, there are certain chakras in the tips of fingers that are \ndirectly connected to the brain. Objects like rudraksha and tulasi beads can \nstimulate those minor energy centers. Thus, there is *some* use in the \nbeginning.\n\n&gt; 1. Does Japa have to be done with a Mala?\n\nUpto you. For most people, I recommend using a maalaa.\n\n&gt; 1. What are the ramifications of crossing the Meru bead?\n\nWhat use is it to know? Avoid it as much as you can. If you cross it, so be \nit. Don&#39;t worry and move on. But, avoid crossing it again.\n\n&gt; I know some scriptures say Japa done with Mala (in my case Vishnu\n&gt; mantra done with Tulsi Mala) is more effective then japa done without\n&gt; Mala.\n&gt;\n&gt; 2. Is this meant to be taken seriously?\n\nIt is also given in a scripture that Rudraksha and Tulasi maalaas can be \nused for chanting any mantra and they are many more times powerful than \nother maalaas. My suggestion is to pick up either a Rudraksha maalaa or a \nTulasi maalaa based on your taste and use it for *all* mantras.\n\nI want to categorically state that using a Tulasi maalaa for Shiva or a \nRudraksha maalaa for Vishnu will NOT do you any harm.\n\n&gt; 3. What should one concentrate when reciting Japa for purpose of\n&gt; remedial measures? The mantra, the devata, one&#39;s goals?\n\nAnything that works as an anchor to limit the mind from straying away too \nmuch is useful. An image or visualization of deity may work for some. \nFocussing on each sound and ups and downs in intonation may work for some. \nThe goal is to minimize other thoughts. Thinking of one&#39;s goals will usually \nmake the mind stray away into unnecessary pre-occupations. It is better to \nfocus on deity or mantra.\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------------------------------------------------------------\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\nDo Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\nSpirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org\n------------------------------------------------------------------ \n\n----- Original Message ----- \nFrom: &quot;sbm_sharma&quot; &lt;sbm_sharma@...&gt;\nTo: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\nSent: Saturday, December 13, 2008 11:59 AM\nSubject: [vedic-wisdom] Mala For Japa?\n\n\n&gt; Hello,\n&gt;\n&gt; This is my first post.
