Can a Guru help us? He took Jiddu Krishnamurthy&#39; s view =\r\non this. JK claims that a guru can not help any one and the self realisatio=\r\nn has to come from with in. My friend is asking, if a Guru is useless as JK=\r\n claims, why did JK write so many books (no offence to JK followers)\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; 2. If a person has to realise on himself, how it can be?\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; 3. If =\r\nthe fact is that there is no I but for Brahman, why all this Maya? Why is B=\r\nraham that is me has to go through the misery and in the end realise that h=\r\ne is Brahman?
