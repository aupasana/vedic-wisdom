In\nsome procedures, the focus is not on the abhisheka, and the rudram /\nchamakam are not recited. The bodhayana shesha sutras (for those who learn\nthe krishna yajur veda) have a procedure for the daily worship of rudra\n(mahAdevasya aharahaH paricaryAvidhiH). Here, in the abhisheka portion, the\nmain mantras recited are the &quot;hiranyavarniiyaa&quot; and &quot;pavamaana&quot; suktas. The\nmost common procedure for rudrAbhisheka includes the laghunyasa, followed\nby abhisheka with the rudra and chamaka mantras.\n\nNarasimha has included the standard &quot;shodashopachara puja&quot; in his homam\nmanuals. You can just follow this. If you want to use more flowers, then\nyou can offer 108 or 1008 flowers (with the same mantra, or while chanting\n108 / 1008 names) before saying &quot;puShpam samarpayAmi&quot;. If you want to do a\nlonger abhisheka, then you can repeat the mantra of your choice before\nsaying &quot;snAnam samarpayAmi&quot;. No particular mantra is required .... re-read\npoint #3 from Narasimha&#39;s reply below.\n\nGenerally speaking, it is reasonable to expect trained priests who follow\nthe krishna yajur veda to recite both the rudra and chamaka. However, the\nrudra prashna is the more important of the two. This is why we repeat only\nthe rudra portion many times (11, 121 etc) when we do a more elaborate\nversion of the rudrabhisheka. An even simpler way is to recite the &quot;rudra\nsukta&quot; which has only 6 mantras, most of which are from the rudra prashna.\nOr, simply recite the mrityunjaya mantra or the panchakshari. There are\nmany options.\n\nsasneham,\n\n    ajit\n\n\n\n\nOn Tue, Feb 25, 2014 at 10:40 AM, amit kumar agrawal &lt;\namitagrawal_mca@...&gt; wrote:\n\n&gt; Dear Group Members,\n&gt;\n&gt; Now a days, the priests are not learned enough to properly perform\n&gt; rudrabhisheka.
