Your understanding is flawed.\n\n1=\r\n. All ideas including the idea of Ahamkara naturally belong to the ideation=\r\nal or causal body, but Ahamkara must be overcome only in the physical body =\r\n(See point 5.). Astral or Causal-bodied beings (those without a physical/as=\r\ntral body) don&#39;t have to fight with the idea of Ahamkara like we do.\n\n&gt; Aha=\r\nmkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-\n&gt; ...they a=\r\nre all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness \n&gt; permeates thr=\r\nough all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n\n2. Where did you re=\r\nad this up ?\n\n   There is a fine line between the sense of I-ness attribute=\r\nd to the Individual Soul and the sense of I-ness derived through the idea o=\r\nf Ahamkara. Even after a Soul is freed of the three bodies, the individuali=\r\nty of the Soul Atom is not destroyed (Resurrection implies that), while it =\r\nhas already given up the idea of Ahamkara including all other ideas.\n\n  Ind=\r\nividuality of a causal-bodied being is not due to the idea of Ahamkara beca=\r\nuse &quot;What exists as a part cannot be the whole&quot;. Thus, the idea of Ahamkara=\r\n, being one of the 35 ideas of the Causal-body, doesn&#39;t account for neither=\r\n controls the rest of the 34 ideas. Each idea is independent of another, wi=\r\nthout requiring another idea to act upon it - otherwise your buddhi would a=\r\nlways interfere with the functioning of Mind or Ahamkara or the 5 functions=\r\n of life-forces and so on.\n\n  Essentially, the 35 ideas of causal body are =\r\nthe basic causal forces and are not related as cause-effect to each other. =\r\nThus, each is independent of the application of the sense of I-ness derived=\r\n from Ahamkara. Manas and Buddhi being two of the Causal-ideas, their funct=\r\nioning as well as existence is not &quot;controlled&quot; nor &quot;derived&quot; in any way by=\r\n the idea of Ahamkara. It is very clear when we see those with sharpest Bud=\r\ndhi or Sharpest Mind still carrying Heaviest Ahamkara, because they didn&#39;t =\r\nwork upon that particular idea.\n\n\n&gt;  But ego/ahamkaara/I-ness is the very b=\r\nasis of the entire \n&gt; individualized consciousness.\n\n3. Well, as most Physi=\r\ncal-bodied beings cannot see through the Astral/causal cosmoses, it doesn&#39;t=\r\n apply in the same way to the finer Astral and Causal-bodied beings who can=\r\n always pierce the veil of Maya and see the human activities. Thus, what is=\r\n &quot;the very basis&quot; of the entire individualized consciousness for a physical=\r\n-bodied (unenlightened) being is not the same as for an astral/causal bodie=\r\nd being.\n  An Astral-bodied being thinks of Manas/sense-consciousness as th=\r\ne very basis of the entire individualized consciousness.\n  A Causal-bodied =\r\nbeing thinks of Chitta/perceptive-consciousness as the very basis of the en=\r\ntire individualized consciousness.\n  However, that individuality is of the =\r\nSoul not derived from any idea, which is why it is not lost when the Astral=\r\n being loses astral consciousness and reincarnates in the Physical body.\n\n =\r\n As an example, Devatas, with their finer bodies, are able to work through =\r\nall the beings in all their physical-bodies simultaneously (like Ganesh res=\r\nides in the Mooladhara, Agni digests the food, and so on..), never getting =\r\ncontrolled by Ahamkara that would require them to say that this particular =\r\nbody is &quot;my body&quot; or that one is mine - unless they incarnate in Physical b=\r\nodies themselves. Devatas are, however, Astral/Causal-bodied beings, so the=\r\ny would attempt to influence the Manas (Spirit-Possession) of the sense-bou=\r\nnd worshipper. Pretas on the other hand, would attempt to possess ones&#39; phy=\r\nsical body as well as act out their Ahamkara.\n\n\n&gt; Out of the four antahkara=\r\nnas, chitta (remembering or conditioned \n&gt; mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ne=\r\nss) are parts of the kaarana \n&gt; sareera (causal body) and remain till the e=\r\nnd.\n\n4. As per the resurrected Soul of Sri Yukteswar in Autobiography of a =\r\nYogi -\n\n  Causal body is a matrix of 35 ideas, that include 19 ideas compri=\r\nsing Astral body (Chitta, Manas, Buddhi, Ahamkara, 5 functions of knowledge=\r\n, 5 functions of Action, 5 functions of life-force) and 16 ideas comprising=\r\n Physical body (16 chemical elements).\n\n  Now, as we all know that Physical=\r\n body expires as a whole, not just one or two of the 16 elements comprising=\r\n it go away at a time, Astral and Causal bodies are also cast off as a whol=\r\ne in the corresponding cosmic consciousness - instead of different constitu=\r\nent ideas slipping out of it at different times. Chitta being the staging i=\r\ndea for all other modifications, can be termed as the last to go, when the =\r\ncausal body is finally dropped - hence I wrote as rising above Chitta.\n\n  T=\r\nhus, the idea of Ahamkara is bound with Gross Physical vibrations, \n  Manas=\r\n with Subtle Astral vibrations and \n  Chitta with infinitely Subtle Causal =\r\nVibrations.\n\n  Buddhi being another variable, can be developed or undevelop=\r\ned irrespective of the other 34. Even illiterate Moodha, through surrender =\r\nto their Guru, attain freedom from Ahamkara and so on...\n\n  BTW, Chitta is =\r\nnot the Conditioned Mind. Chitta does store the residual impressions of all=\r\n the past incarnations. However, being constituted of Satwa Guna, it doesn&#39;=\r\nt have any inherent ability to act upon (Rajas) those impressions, just lik=\r\ne a container containing an inflammable liquid doesn&#39;t automatically burn i=\r\nt down. Sadhana is required for That.\n  The Samskaras stored by Chitta, inc=\r\nluding those of Nidra, Smriti, Vikalpa, Viparyaya, Pramana, correspond to t=\r\nhe Tamo Guna, while the Chitta itself is Satva Guna - hence the &quot;Satvic - T=\r\namas&quot; represents the SuperEther tattwa (refer my previous mail). The all-pe=\r\nrceiving Satvic Chitta doesn&#39;t get conditioned by the Tamo-guni Samskaras i=\r\nt stores.\n  Once the Chitta calms down, cleared of all residual impressions=\r\n, only Satva Guna remains, the intuition becomes coherent and the Soul refl=\r\nects on itself as distinct from Satva Guna of Prakriti (Chitta), thus reali=\r\nzing its own nature as Brahman.\n\n5. \n  In Patanjali Yoga Sutras:  \n  drigad=\r\narshanaktyorekatmataivasmita -6\n  Egoism is the identification of the seer =\r\nwith the instrument of seeing. Patanjali has used Asmita instead of Ahamkar=\r\na.\n  Since astral-bodied beings can use any of the senses like eyes to see,=\r\n hear, smell, taste and so on (refer Autobiography of a Yogi)... the sense =\r\nof egoism does not take roots in the astral-body and hence doesn&#39;t create A=\r\nstral Karma. Similarly, Causal bodied beings can use thought to sense every=\r\nthing.\n\n   Hence, Egotism has to be rooted out while the consciousness is a=\r\nssociated with the Physical Body sensory activities or has Physical Karma.\n=\r\n\n6. The idea of Manas, as the controller of sense-consciousness, must be ov=\r\nercome in Astral body, through Vairagya. Read autobiography of a Yogi (chap=\r\nter 43) where Sri Yukteswar illustrates that only those beings who cannot b=\r\ne tempted to go back to the pleasing to the eye Astral cosmos are permitted=\r\n to stay permanently in the Causal cosmos. Pleasing to the eye implies Sens=\r\ne-consciousness which is associated with Manas.\n\n  In Patanjali Yoga Sutras=\r\n also it is mentioned in the same manner :\n\n  dristanushravika vishaya vitr=\r\nishnasya vashikara samjnavairagyam -15-\n\n  That effect which comes to these=\r\n who have given up their thirst after objects, either seen or heard, and wh=\r\nich wills to control the objects, is non-attachment. Vivekananda has commen=\r\nted that Vairagya is the only way to freedom.\n\n  This is to be accomplished=\r\n by transferring the consciousness to Astral-Body and working out the Astra=\r\nl Karma or otherwise as an astral-bodied being.\n\n7. Patanjali Yoga Sutras:\n=\r\n   yogashchittavrittinirodhah -2-\n   Thus, extinguishing all the movements =\r\nof Chitta is called &quot;Yoga&quot;. \n\n  This is to be accomplished by transferring =\r\nthe consciousness to Causal-Body and working out the Causal Karma or otherw=\r\nise as a causal-bodied being.\n\n  I hope this clarifies.\n\nRegards,\nNitish\n\n-=\r\n-- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; =\r\nNamaste Nitish,\n&gt;  \n&gt; I am afraid you are mixing up terminologies. For exam=\r\nple, ego or ahamkaara (sense of I-ness) is not limited to the physical body=\r\n, but extends to subtle body and causal body as well. In fact, ego resides =\r\nin the causal body and affects other bodies. Out of the four antahkaranas, =\r\nchitta (remembering or conditioned mind) and ahamkaara (ego or I-ness) are =\r\nparts of the kaarana sareera (causal body) and remain till the end.\n&gt;  \n&gt; A=\r\nhamkaara/ego controls manas and buddhi also. When manas (sensory-motor mind=\r\n) observes sensory inputs or buddhi (intellectual or thinking mind) analyze=\r\ns current and past observations of mind or chitta (remembering or condition=\r\ned mind) stores various observations or retrieves previously stored observa=\r\ntions, they are all guided by the sense of I-ness. That sense of I-ness per=\r\nmeates through all layers of one&#39;s individualized consciousness.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Upan=\r\nishads and various scriptures have broken down the individualized conscious=\r\nness into various groups by functionality, like five koshas, three sareeras=\r\n, five praanas, five jnaanendriyas, five karmendriyas, four antahkaranas, s=\r\nix/seven chakras etc. But ego/ahamkaara/I-ness is the very basis of the ent=\r\nire individualized consciousness.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Though the word jnaana means differ=\r\nent things to different people, a jnaana yogi pursues Self by the path of c=\r\nontemplation and discrimination. When a jnaana yogi reaches the final targe=\r\nt, all bodies and koshas are merged in cosmos.\n&gt;  \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasi=\r\nmha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; =\r\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do Pitri =\r\nTarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spirituality: h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): htt=\r\np://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://w=\r\nww.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.Sri=\r\nJagannath.org\n&gt; -----------------------------------------------------------=\r\n-------\n&gt;  \n&gt; ---- yeeahoo_99 &lt;nitish.arya@...&gt; wrote: \n&gt; &gt; || OM TAT SAT |=\r\n|\n&gt; &gt; Dear Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;    In my opinion, there are three distinct phases=\r\n that lead the sould to rise above Ego, Mind and Chitta - corresponding to =\r\nthe three bodies physical (Sthoola), astral (Sookshma) and causal (Karana) =\r\nresp.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Rising above Ego is Jnana   - Merging Physical body in Physi=\r\ncal cosmos\n&gt; &gt; Rising above Mind is Vairagya - Merging Astral body in Astra=\r\nl cosmos\n&gt; &gt; Rising above Chitta is Yoga   - Merging Causal body in Causal =\r\ncosmos\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Finally, becoming established in Para-Brahman is YogaAru=\r\ndha.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;    Your comments.\n&gt; &gt; Regards,\n&gt; &gt; Nitish\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; --- In ved=\r\nic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

Indeed it is one of the finest path I am sure.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         How=\r\never, my understanding of this path differs a little from your understandin=\r\ng. Gyana, I believe, is not really study of scriptures or scholarly argumen=\r\nts, pros and con, debates etc etc. Gyana, in my opinion, is a state of bein=\r\ng,  where one percieves a certain oneness in the universe. It is achieved t=\r\nhrough sadhana. To be constantly in a state of discrimination between real =\r\nand not-real, rejecting the non-real, such that whatever is finally left is=\r\n nothing but the eternal. This is the sadhana of the marga called Gyan. But=\r\n sadhana it is without a doubt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         Whatever be the path, =\r\nsadhana is a must to achieve the results. Adi Shankara, they say, was an ex=\r\npert in the scriptures and scriptural debates. But I feel, he engaged in al=\r\nl these once he had already become a gyani through his sadhana. He was not =\r\na gyani because he debated a lot or knew many scriptures, he was a gyani be=\r\ncause he had achieved a state of oneness. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         IMHO, scrip=\r\ntural knowledge is not the marg of gyana.Gyana marg is more complex and req=\r\nuires more than mere intellectual abilities.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         -Regards\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;          Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt;          \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         The upsurge (of consc=\r\niousness) is Bhairava - Shiva Sutra\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;         --- On Tue,=\r\n 29/9/09, pvklnrao &lt;pvklnrao@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           From: p=\r\nvklnrao &lt;pvklnrao@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Order of Cr=\r\neation (of mahabhuta/tattwa)?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Date: Tuesday, 29 September, 2009, 11:09 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;      =\r\n       \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           Rajarshi,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           With all due respe=\r\nct, I disagree.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           There is no question that is useless=\r\n and there is no answer that is not relavent.

My understanding of any of these=\r\n limited.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;           1. Bhakthi - Surrender to God. Here you rest all =\r\nother thoughts but for thought pertaining to God. You do not question any t=\r\nhing related to him and give-in completely to the believe that he is there =\r\nand is your master. By doing so, you are coming out of the clutches of the =\r\nregular perceptions or dimentions of this material world.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;     =\r\n      2. Raja - You focus on doing specific postures and concentrate deeply=\r\n on the way you do things and draw your self away from the regular senses.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           3. Karma - Unattached karma. If you can do it, you a=\r\nre not even thinking about God, but, have got him.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           4=\r\n. jnana - By questioning available information, using logic and try to brea=\r\nk out of current assumptions and try to discover. Saying, this will not yie=\r\nld results is not a wise thing. How ever, perhaps, this is the most defficu=\r\nlt. But, with so many others who are experiancing God, not sure, why the wr=\r\nong in current axioms can not be corrected. Unfortunately, those who are re=\r\nalised, do not perhaps think it is relavent.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;           There i=\r\ns a soul. Now is Soul physical or not? Can it be seen?
