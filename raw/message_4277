God, the wor=\r\nld, the mind\ndesires,action, sorrow and all other things are all concepts=\r\n=E2=80=9D.\n\nBhagavan Sri Ramana Maharshi, a famous Sage of modern India, at=\r\ntributed\nunique value to this lucid exposition of Supreme Truth. He often r=\r\neferred to\nit in his talks with devotees and seekers, and he is reported to=\r\n have said\nthat is one repeatedly read Chapter 26 of the Ribhu Gita one cou=\r\nld pass\nspontaneously into samadhi, or the natural state of Self-realizatio=\r\nn.\n\nThe Ribhu Gita, literally =E2=80=9CRibhu=E2=80=99s Song=E2=80=9D, is Pa=\r\nrt Six of the Shiva Rahasya,a\nlegendary mystical text of India. The whole o=\r\nf the Ribhu Gita is said to\nrepresent the teaching given to the Sage Ribhu =\r\nby God himself in the form of\nLord Shiva, the formless aspect of the Divine=\r\n activity, in whom all beings\nand things are always already absorbed. The S=\r\nage in turn gave the teaching\nto his reluctant disciple Nidagha.\n\n\nThe Hear=\r\nt of the Ribhu Gita\n\n1. I shall now expound to you the method of inhering i=\r\nn the All-inclusive\nand undifferentiated Reality. This teaching is secret a=\r\nnd difficult to\nunderstand even with the help of the various Scriptures. Ev=\r\nen celestial\nbeings and practitioners of spiritual discipline who hold it d=\r\near acquire it\nonly with great difficulty. Follow what I say and, inhering =\r\nin Reality,be\nhappy.\n\n2. My son! Realized sages say that absolute inherence=\r\n in Reality means\nbecoming one with the immutable, tranquil, non-dual Absol=\r\nute Supreme Being\nwhich is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss and the Self of al=\r\nl, and making the\nwandering mind one with it like the proverbial milk and w=\r\nater, absolutely\nfree from all concepts.\n\n3.

Let this\nknowledge become firm with you by c=\r\nonstant practice. Then,discarding\neverything, become one with the Supreme A=\r\nbsolute Reality and, remaining as\nthat, be happy.\n\n4. Abide as That which d=\r\noes not, when scrutinized, show any duality in the\nform of these various ob=\r\njects or the least trace of cause and effect, That\nin which, when the mind =\r\nis absorbed in It, there is not fear of duality at\nall =E2=80=93 and be alw=\r\nays happy, unshakable and free the fear arising from\nduality.\n\n5.

Abide as That in which there are no sense organs or anyone =\r\nto use\nthe,That in which transcendent bliss is experienced, That which is\na=\r\nbsolutely immediate, That by realizing and attaining which one becomes\nimmo=\r\nrtal, That by becoming which one does not return to this cycle of births\nan=\r\nd deaths =E2=80=93 and be always happy, without the least trace of thought.=\r\n\n\n24. Abide as That, on realizing and experiencing the bliss of which, all\n=\r\njoys appear to be the joys of That, That which, when clearly known to be\non=\r\neself, shows there is nothing apart from oneself, and, knowing which,all\nki=\r\nnds of separate souls become liberated =E2=80=93 and be always happy,withou=\r\nt the\nleast trace of thought.\n\n25. Abide as That, on realizing which to be =\r\noneself, there is nothing else\nto be known, everything becomes already know=\r\nn and every purpose accomplished\n=E2=80=93 and be always happy, without the=\r\n least trace of thought.\n\n26. Abide as That which is attained easily when o=\r\nne is convinced that one is\nnot different from the Supreme Absolute, That w=\r\nhich results, when that\nconviction becomes firm, in the experience of the S=\r\nupreme Bliss of the Real,\nThat which produces a sense of incomparable and c=\r\nomplete satisfaction when\nthe mind is absorbed in It =E2=80=93 and be alway=\r\ns happy,without the least trace of\nthought.\n\n27. Abide as That which leads =\r\nto the complete cessation of misery when the\nmind is absorbed in It, and th=\r\ne extinction of all ideas of =E2=80=9CI,=E2=80=9D =E2=80=9Cyou=E2=80=9D and=\r\n\n=E2=80=9Canother,=E2=80=9D and the disappearance of al differences =E2=80=\r\n=93 and be always happy,\nwithout the least trace of thought.\n\n28. Abide as =\r\nThat in which, when the mind is absorbed in It, one remains\nwithout a secon=\r\nd, nothing other than oneself is seen to exist and\nincomparable bliss is ex=\r\nperienced =E2=80=93 and be always happy, without the least\ntrace of thought=\r\n.\n\n29. Abide as That which is undifferentiated Existence, undifferentiated\n=\r\nConsciousness, undifferentiated Bliss, absolutely non-dual, the\nundifferent=\r\niated Absolute Reality =E2=80=93 and with the firm conviction that you\nare =\r\nThat, be always happy.\n\n30. Abide as That which is =E2=80=9CI=E2=80=9D as w=\r\nell as =E2=80=9Cyou=E2=80=9D as well as everyone else, is\nthe basis of all,=\r\n is one without anything else whatsoever, is extremely\npure, the undifferen=\r\ntiated Whole =E2=80=93 and with the firmconviction that you are\nThat, be al=\r\nways happy.\n\n31. Abide as That in which there are no concepts or anything e=\r\nlse\nwhatsoever, the ego ceases to exist, all desires disappear, the mind be=\r\ncomes\nextinct and all confusions come to an end =E2=80=93 and with the firm=\r\n conviction\nthat you are That, be always happy.\n\n32. Abide as That in which=\r\n there is no awareness of the body, or the various\nfunctions of manifest ex=\r\nistence, no perception of objects, That in which the\nmind is dead, the soul=\r\n become one with the Reality,thoughts dissolved and\neven one=E2=80=99s conv=\r\nictions no longer hold =E2=80=93 and with the firm conviction that\nyou are =\r\nThat, be always happy.\n\n33. Abide as That in which there is no longer any m=\r\neditative spiritual\npractice or ignorance or knowledge or activities of any=\r\n kind, that which is\nthe Supreme Reality =E2=80=93 and with the firm convic=\r\ntion that you are That, be\nalways happy.\n\n34. Abide as That in which, when =\r\none is completely merged with It, one\nexperiences pure bliss, never experie=\r\nnces misery, sees nothing, does not\ntake birth again, never thinks oneself =\r\nto be a separate individual,becomes\nthe Supreme Being and with the convicti=\r\non that you are That,be always happy.\n\n35. Abide as That which is truly the=\r\n Supreme Absolute Reality, the Supreme\nFormless God, the absolutely pure Be=\r\ning, the Supreme State, Absolute\nConsciousness, the Supreme Truth =E2=80=93=\r\n and with the conviction that you are\nThat, be always happy.\n\n36. Abide as =\r\nThat which is the absolutely pure Supreme Being, absolute\nBliss, the suprem=\r\nely subtle Being, the Self-Effulgent, non-dual and\nundifferentiated One =E2=\r\n=80=93 and with the conviction that you are That, be always\nhappy.\n\n37. Abi=\r\nde as That which is absolute Truth, supreme Tranquility, eternal\nBeing, abs=\r\nolutely attributeless, the Self, the absolutely undifferentiated\nSupreme Be=\r\ning =E2=80=93 and with the conviction that you are That, be always happy.\n\n=\r\n38. Abide as That which is everything from the experiential point of view\na=\r\nnd nothing from the absolute point of view, Existence =E2=80=93Consciousnes=\r\ns-Bliss,\nalways tranquil, with nothing separate from It, the self-existent =\r\nBeing =E2=80=93and\nwith the conviction that you are That be always happy.\n\n=\r\n39. I have thus, O Nidagha, clearly explained to you the state of being one=\r\n\nwith the Supreme Being. By constantly thinking that you are the\nundifferen=\r\ntiated Supreme Being you can attain that state and enjoy constant\nbliss. Th=\r\nere after, having become the Supreme Absolute Reality, you will\nnever exper=\r\nience the misery that comes from\nidentification with birth and death.\n\n40. =\r\n=E2=80=9CEverything is the Supreme Being, which is\nExistence-Consciousness-=\r\nBliss, and I am That=E2=80=9D By constantly cultivating this\npure thought, =\r\nget rid of impure thoughts. Then, my son, discarding even that\nthought and =\r\nalways inhering in the State of Fullness, you will become the\nnon-dual and =\r\nundifferentiated Supreme Being and attain liberation.\n\n41. Pure and impure =\r\nthoughts are a feature of the mind. There are no\nwandering thoughts in the =\r\nSupreme Being. Therefore, abide as That and, free\nfrom the pure and impure =\r\nthoughts of the mind, remain still like a stone or\na log of wood. You will =\r\nthen be always happy.\n\n42. By constantly thinking of the undifferentiated S=\r\nupreme Being and\nforgetting thereby all thoughts, including the thought of =\r\nthe Supreme Being,\nyou will become the all-comprehensive Supreme Being. Eve=\r\nn a great sinner who\nhears and understands this teaching will get rid of al=\r\nl his sins and become\nthe undifferentiated Supreme Being.\n\n43. The endless =\r\ntextbooks of spiritual instruction have already prescribed\nmeditation for a=\r\nttaining purity of mind. In order that those who have become\npure in mind m=\r\nay easily attain liberation and, realizing that they are\nabsolute and bound=\r\nless Bliss, remain still like a stone in the\nundifferentiated and all-compr=\r\nehensive Supreme Formless God, the nature of\nthis immaculate state has been=\r\n expounded by me.\n\n44. Therefore, attaining purity of mind by constantly th=\r\ninking that\neverything that is known is the Supreme Being and that Supreme =\r\nBeing is\noneself, and thereafter abiding in the state of complete identity =\r\nwith the\nAbsolute Reality, liberation can be attained here and now. I have =\r\nspoken the\ntruth. In this manner, Sage Ribhu expounded the true and full st=\r\nate of being\nto Nidagha.\n\n45. When one is convinced that one is always That=\r\n which is\nExistence-Consciousness-Bliss and abides as That in a state of co=\r\nmplete\nidentity,one casts off the unreal bondage of identification with bir=\r\nth and\ndeath and attains liberation. This is the significance of the highly=\r\n\nblissful mood and dance of our Supreme and undifferentiated God.\n\n-- \n=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd1a0aa66e55504856f0303\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana;line-height:16px&quot;&gt;=\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Preface&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=E2=80=9CThe ego or =\r\nseparate soul is a concept(idea).

Abide as That in which there is no awareness of the bod=\r\ny, or the various functions of manifest existence, no perception of objects=\r\n, That in which the mind is dead, the soul become one with the Reality,thou=\r\nghts dissolved and even one=E2=80=99s convictions no longer hold =E2=80=93 =\r\nand with the firm conviction that you are That, be always happy.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;3=\r\n3. Abide as That in which there is no longer any meditative spiritual pract=\r\nice or ignorance or knowledge or activities of any kind, that which is the =\r\nSupreme Reality =E2=80=93 and with the firm conviction that you are That, b=\r\ne always happy.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;34. Abide as That in which, when one is completely=\r\n merged with It, one experiences pure bliss, never experiences misery, sees=\r\n nothing, does not take birth again, never thinks oneself to be a separate =\r\nindividual,becomes the Supreme Being and with the conviction that you are T=\r\nhat,be always happy.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;35. Abide as That which is truly the Supreme =\r\nAbsolute Reality, the Supreme Formless God, the absolutely pure Being, the =\r\nSupreme State, Absolute Consciousness, the Supreme Truth =E2=80=93 and with=\r\n the conviction that you are That, be always happy.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;36. Abide as T=\r\nhat which is the absolutely pure Supreme Being, absolute Bliss, the supreme=\r\nly subtle Being, the Self-Effulgent, non-dual and undifferentiated One =E2=\r\n=80=93 and with the conviction that you are That, be always happy.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br=\r\n&gt;37. Abide as That which is absolute Truth, supreme Tranquility, eternal Be=\r\ning, absolutely attributeless, the Self, the absolutely undifferentiated Su=\r\npreme Being =E2=80=93 and with the conviction that you are That, be always =\r\nhappy.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;38. Abide as That which is everything from the experiential=\r\n point of view and nothing from the absolute point of view, Existence =E2=\r\n=80=93Consciousness-Bliss, always tranquil, with nothing separate from It, =\r\nthe self-existent Being =E2=80=93and with the conviction that you are That =\r\nbe always happy.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;39. I have thus, O Nidagha, clearly explained to =\r\nyou the state of being one with the Supreme Being. By constantly thinking t=\r\nhat you are the undifferentiated Supreme Being you can attain that state an=\r\nd enjoy constant bliss. There after, having become the Supreme Absolute Rea=\r\nlity, you will never experience the misery that comes from&lt;br&gt;\n\nidentificat=\r\nion with birth and death.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;40. =E2=80=9CEverything is the Supreme Bei=\r\nng, which is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss, and I am That=E2=80=9D By const=\r\nantly cultivating this pure thought, get rid of impure thoughts. Then, my s=\r\non, discarding even that thought and always inhering in the State of Fullne=\r\nss, you will become the non-dual and undifferentiated Supreme Being and att=\r\nain liberation.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;41. Pure and impu=\r\nre thoughts are a feature of the mind. There are no wandering thoughts in t=\r\nhe Supreme Being. Therefore, abide as That and, free from the pure and impu=\r\nre thoughts of the mind, remain still like a stone or a log of wood. You wi=\r\nll then be always happy.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;4=\r\n2. By constantly thinking of the undifferentiated Supreme Being and forgett=\r\ning thereby all thoughts, including the thought of the Supreme Being, you w=\r\nill become the all-comprehensive Supreme Being. Even a great sinner who hea=\r\nrs and understands this teaching will get rid of all his sins and become th=\r\ne undifferentiated Supreme Being.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;43. The endless textbooks=\r\n of spiritual instruction have already prescribed meditation for attaining =\r\npurity of mind. In order that those who have become pure in mind may easily=\r\n attain liberation and, realizing that they are absolute and boundless Blis=\r\ns, remain still like a stone in the undifferentiated and all-comprehensive =\r\nSupreme Formless God, the nature of this immaculate state has been expounde=\r\nd by me.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;44. Therefore, attaining=\r\n purity of mind by constantly thinking that everything that is known is the=\r\n Supreme Being and that Supreme Being is oneself, and thereafter abiding in=\r\n the state of complete identity with the Absolute Reality, liberation can b=\r\ne attained here and now. I have spoken the truth. In this manner, Sage Ribh=\r\nu expounded the true and full state of being to Nidagha.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;s=\r\npan style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;45. When one is convinced that one is always=\r\n That which is Existence-Consciousness-Bliss and abides as That in a state =\r\nof complete identity,one casts off the unreal bondage of identification wit=\r\nh birth and death and attains liberation. This is the significance of the h=\r\nighly blissful mood and dance of our Supreme and undifferentiated God.&lt;/spa=\r\nn&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;-- &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=93=E0=B0=82 =C2=A0=E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=8B =C2=A0=E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B6=E0=\r\n=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80 =C2=A0=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=\r\n=AF =C2=A0 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D =C2=A0=E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D=\r\n=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82 &lt;br&gt;=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=\r\n=81 =C2=A0&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\r\n--000e0cd1a0aa66e55504856f0303--\r\n\n"}}
