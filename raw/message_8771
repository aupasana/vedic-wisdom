PurascharaNa or regular \n&gt; chan=\r\nting. Doesnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You \n&gt; have=\r\n to follow it strictly.&gt;.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It is always good to do japa, but &quot;strict=\r\n&quot; is too strong a word. There are many in different parts of India, well ve=\r\nrsed in sadhana as well as respective shastras (respective because no singl=\r\ne human being can known all possible Hindu Shastras, so most study that whi=\r\nch maybe relevant to his line of spiritual inquiry followed in his traditio=\r\nn) who do homas without doing any pre-requisite japa. \n&gt; \n&gt; One honest ques=\r\ntion that every sadhaka must ask himself/herself objectively is, how badly =\r\ndo we want God? If the desire pure and unblemished, or is it also mixed wit=\r\nh various other desires, however small they maybe. If we also want other ma=\r\nterialistic things along with it - and there is no harm in wanting legitima=\r\nte things - then one can follow all instructions and rules set for whatever=\r\n parampara one is mentally afflicted to and given by his/her Guru(s). \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n But if one is desirous of ONLY God without any other desire attached to it=\r\n, no rule is sufficient, no path is a guarantee, no sadhana is sure-shot wa=\r\ny to achieve it.=C2=A0 Working on internal surrender to God and increased d=\r\netachment in daily life along with and through whatever ritual one performs=\r\n and in whatever manner, can be more helpful in the long run. Human aspirat=\r\nion alone is not enough. When the aspiration is genuine and pure, He/She ex=\r\ntends his/her energy to lift the sadhak up.. this dual phenomenon together =\r\nmake a sadhana success. And this simple yet powerful truth is represented b=\r\ny the six-pointed triangle which is the basic yantra of so many deities, an=\r\nd specially one form of the Mother. The upward triangle is our aspiration, =\r\nthe downward is Her grace coming down to transform the sadhak from his/her =\r\ncurrent state. Together, it makes a complete whole. And grace is purely pro=\r\nportional to the purity of the aspiration, which only God can judge\n&gt;  accu=\r\nrately.\n&gt; \n&gt; -Regards\n&gt; =C2=A0Rajarshi \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; awaktam wyaktimApannam many=\r\nantE mAmabuddhayah |\n&gt; param bhAwamajAnanto mamAwyayamanuttamam ||[7:24]\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; ________________________________\n&gt;  From: ashutosh.srikanth &lt;ashutosh=\r\n.srikanth@...&gt;\n&gt; To: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com \n&gt; Sent: Monday, 22 Octob=\r\ner 2012 5:17 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Homam - Ahuti numbers\n&gt;  \n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\n=C2=A0 \n&gt; My pranams to all.\n&gt; I have been performing weekly havan for more=\r\n than a year and half.\n&gt; I want to point out certain things related to hava=\r\nn so that it can be done as per shastra by others too.\n&gt; I am using a conve=\r\nrsation that in fact took place to bring out these relevant points.\n&gt; \n&gt; So=\r\nmetime back there was informal &quot;prashNa&quot; session whose summary I am present=\r\ning below: \n&gt; \n&gt; [South Indians might be familiar with similar &quot;ashTamangal=\r\na prashNa&quot; conducted in temples when something goes wrong - called as dosha=\r\n.]\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: There seems to be a dosha... Hmm... let me see..=\r\n. Hmm.. Yes... You seem to be performing some kind of Agni karya at your ho=\r\nme regularly.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Yes (I was actually very surprised by this point=\r\ned question because I had not told anybody about the havan I did at home)\n&gt;=\r\n \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: There are certain errors in the agni karya you are d=\r\noing. You seem to be using dry samith materials. And your ahuti does not se=\r\nem to be right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Yes I am using Til (sesame seeds).\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashN=\r\na conductor: You should mix that with atleast a little bit of ghee before g=\r\niving it as ahuti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Ok. And what is the dosha in my ahuti apart=\r\n from that?\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor: Do you do required Japa before giving a=\r\nhutis? And do you do the ahuti with the same mantra that you use for your r=\r\negular japa?\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: What?... Required Japa? Is there a pre-requisite =\r\nlike that? No I dont do any pre-defined set of japa?\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa conductor=\r\n: Yes. Strictly the japa-ahuti ratio is shatamsha. (that is for every 100 r=\r\necitation of a mantra via meditation, one becomes qualified for one ahuti) =\r\nor at least it should be dashamsha ( i.e. for every 10 recitations of mantr=\r\na in meditation, one is qualified to give 1 ahuti)\n&gt; \n&gt; Myself: Doesnt that=\r\n only apply to purascharaNa (based on what I read in Aghore book - as every=\r\nbody in this group is already familiar with that book series)\n&gt; \n&gt; PrashNa =\r\nconductor: No it applies to anything. PurascharaNa or regular chanting. Doe=\r\nsnt matter. The rule is always 1:100 or at least 1:10. You have to follow i=\r\nt strictly.\n&gt; \n&gt; The conversation went onto several other things. Subsequen=\r\ntly I went on to get mantra-upadesha from a accomplished seer and reciting =\r\nthat mantra and also using the same mantra for my ahuti in homam as per the=\r\n above mentioned ratio only and have been very happy with my spiritual prog=\r\nress since. \n&gt; \n&gt; Whether all the homa-practioners in this group agree with=\r\n me or not, I just wanted to point this out to all requesting everybody to =\r\nperform at least 10 times Japa of the mantra used for ahuti to get the &quot;qua=\r\nlification&quot; for the ahuti.\n&gt; \n&gt; Regards,\n&gt; Ashutosh\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
