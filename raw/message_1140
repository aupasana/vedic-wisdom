Rao&quot; &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; \n&gt; In my judgm=\r\nent, a rudraksha mala is more than \nenough for Ganesha sadhana.\n&gt; \n&gt; For La=\r\nkshmi, kamalagutta mala (a garland of lotus \nseeds) is considered the \n&gt; be=\r\nst. I did use one that was gifted by the same \npriest who gifted me so many=\r\n \n&gt; other religious articles. However, in my judgment, \nI had more fruitful=\r\n \n&gt; sessions of Mahalakshmi meditation with \nRudraksha mala than with it. \n=\r\n&gt; Rudraksha and Tulasi are very special compared \nto all other malas.\n&gt; \n&gt; =\r\nInstead of using a different mala for each deity, it \nis a good idea to use=\r\n a \n&gt; single mala for all meditation and let it be a \nrepository of all the=\r\n \n&gt; generated energy.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; This reminds me of an u=\r\nnrelated incident. When \nShata Chandi homam conducted \n&gt; in Chennai in Marc=\r\nh 2006 was finished, priests \nbathed the idols in the \n&gt; garbhaalaya with t=\r\nhe water from the kalashas \n(pots) used in the homas and \n&gt; brought malas f=\r\nrom the idol and gave them to us. \nThe priest put a Rudraksha \n&gt; mala from =\r\nthe Mother around my neck. A passing \nthought came to me and got \n&gt; stuck i=\r\nn my mind for a couple of seconds, &quot;I \nalready have so many rudraksha \n&gt; ma=\r\nlas, but I have no sphatika mala, which is \nconsidered ideal for the \n&gt; Mot=\r\nher. I just took a vow of doing Chandipath for \n108 days. I wish he had \n&gt; =\r\ngiven me a sphatika mala instead of this \nrudraksha mala.&quot; Then I forgot \n&gt;=\r\n about that stupid thought.\n&gt; \n&gt; This was in the afternoon. Next morning, w=\r\ne were \nin a flight from Chennai to \n&gt; Hyderabad. In another day, I was to =\r\nleave for \nBoston. In the flight to\n&gt; Hyderabad, my son was kicking the sea=\r\nt in front of \nhim and the gentleman \n&gt; turned back to complain. I apologiz=\r\ned and told my \nson to behave. The \n&gt; gentleman turned forward and again tu=\r\nrned back \nin a few seconds and asked \n&gt; &quot;you are PVR Narasimha Rao, right?=\r\n&quot; I said yes. \nHe apparently uses my free \n&gt; Jyotish software and likes me.=\r\n Though I had \noffered all my hair to Balaji at \n&gt; Thirumala a few days bac=\r\nk and was without any \nhair, he still identified me \n&gt; based on a photo pub=\r\nlished 6 years back in an \ninterview in a Jyotish \n&gt; magazine! He talked to=\r\n me for a while.\n&gt; \n&gt; When we reached Hyderabad, he ran to the \nbaggage cla=\r\nim, collected his \n&gt; suitcase, took out a sphatika mala from it and \ngifted=\r\n it to me. He said he \n&gt; met a saint on the previous afternoon at Chennai \n=\r\nand the saint gave him \n&gt; three sphatika malas - one for him, one for a \nfa=\r\nmily member and the third \n&gt; one meant for someone else. The saint told him=\r\n \nthat he would meet somebody \n&gt; he respected on the next day and he was \ns=\r\nupposed to hand over the mala to \n&gt; that person. When he saw me, he decided=\r\n that the \nmala was meant for me. \n&gt; Interestingly, his meeting with the sa=\r\nint happened \naround the same time I \n&gt; had that stupid thought about sphat=\r\nika mala in the \ngarbhalaya of the temple.\n&gt; \n&gt; During shata Chandi homam, =\r\nI took a vow to read \nChandipath for 108 \n&gt; consecutive days. I did it and =\r\nused that mala to \ncount the moola mantra. At \n&gt; the end, that priest came =\r\nto Boston and conducted \n10 Chandi homas at our \n&gt; house to complete the sa=\r\ndhana. During the last \nhomam, a strong thought came \n&gt; to my mind, &quot;the pu=\r\nrpose for which that sphatika \nmala was sent is over. Now \n&gt; offer it back =\r\nto the Mother in fire.&quot; I suppressed \nmy instincts and did not \n&gt; do it. I =\r\nwanted to hang on to it. See, I formed an \nattachment with it! \n&gt; Interesti=\r\nngly, that mala broke on the same \nevening, a little after that \n&gt; homam wa=\r\ns finished! Of course, I made a mala \nagain with the sphatikas and \n&gt; kept =\r\nit for offering it in fire next time. Now I \nrealized that my attachment \n&gt;=\r\n was foolish.\n&gt; \n&gt; Of course, I did Chandipath and Chandi homam \nmany more =\r\ntimes after that, but \n&gt; that was the first 108 and I was destined to use \n=\r\nthe mala given by that \n&gt; saint for that round. Now, of course, I use the \n=\r\nsame rudraksha mala for \n&gt; everything and did not look for another sphatika=\r\n \nmala.\n&gt; \n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt; \n&gt; It is the nature of mind to see varie=\r\nty. There are \ndifferent types of malas \n&gt; and different kinds of rituals a=\r\nnd mind is \nfascinated by the variety. At the \n&gt; end, mind needs to be trai=\r\nned to see the same in \nthe variety. But, in the \n&gt; beginning, mind does se=\r\ne variety and it needs to \nwade through variety...\n&gt; \n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Nar=\r\nasimha\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------------------\n----=\r\n-\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam\n&gt; Do P=\r\nitri Tarpanas Yourself: \nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana\n&gt; Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-\nwisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP=\r\n3): \nhttp://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): =\r\n\nhttp://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: \nhttp=\r\n://www.SriJagannath.org\n&gt; -------------------------------------------------=\r\n------------\n----- \n&gt; \n&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; From: &quot;sbm_sharma&quot;=\r\n &lt;sbm_sharma@...&gt;\n&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&gt;\n&gt; Sent: Friday, Febr=\r\nuary 06, 2009 3:27 PM\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Mala For Ganesha\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; Dea=\r\nr Narasimha,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste.
