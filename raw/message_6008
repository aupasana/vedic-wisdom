Even if you leave y=\r\nour\n&gt;&gt; room with &quot;Black Shades&quot; would be fine and actually more beautiful :=\r\n)\n&gt;&gt; ***\n&gt;&gt; Answers to your questions:\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 1) YES. It is portable. Every =\r\nday I adjust it near my window and after\n&gt;&gt; finishing homam, i take it back=\r\n little inside so that window can be closed.\n&gt;&gt; I am able to adjust it myse=\r\nlf alone in just a few *seconds*.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 2) It is made of G.I Sheets (Galvan=\r\nized Iron) of 22 Gauge. This was\n&gt;&gt; manufactured by a Local EPC contracting=\r\n company dealing in AC Duct\n&gt;&gt; installation. A Technical Supervisor of that=\r\n company is my close family\n&gt;&gt; friend. He did this for me. I suggest checki=\r\nng with any Restaurants. They\n&gt;&gt; all are having such arrangements and they =\r\nwould be able to help you to\n&gt;&gt; contact such manufacturers.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 3) YES, b=\r\necause it is a Metal (GI Sheet) it gets quite heated up. One can\n&gt;&gt; not tou=\r\nch during Homam. However, it also cools down quickly. Within half an\n&gt;&gt; hou=\r\nr after Homam is finished, temperature of the chimney comes down to room\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n temperature.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; 4) It has a Metallic FAN at the end. I was starting tha=\r\nt FAN only when\n&gt;&gt; Fire goes of and lot of Smoke is generated. Reasons are =\r\nas follows:\n&gt;&gt; i)The fan is powerful and makes a lot of noise which disturb=\r\ns\n&gt;&gt; concentration.\n&gt;&gt; ii) In the beginning, when Fire is very small, the p=\r\nowerful exhaust by the\n&gt;&gt; fan, disturbed the flames and sometimes extinguis=\r\nhed it.\n&gt;&gt; 1ii) When Fire is there in the Homam, one need not worry about s=\r\nmoke\n&gt;&gt; handling. the reason is that the smoke naturally travels upward and=\r\n it is\n&gt;&gt; automatically guided to the exit of the chimney. Once the fire be=\r\ncomes\n&gt;&gt; strong, it generates vacuum around Homam kundam area and starts pu=\r\nlling\n&gt;&gt; outside air. For instance, smoke from incense stick (Agarbatti), t=\r\nhough\n&gt;&gt; outside of chimney and quite far away, actually gets diverted into=\r\n the\n&gt;&gt; Chimney via square opening at the bottom. Hence during homam, FAN i=\r\ns not\n&gt;&gt; required.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; iv) Now very important thing. I used fan for many =\r\nmonths (only at the end\n&gt;&gt; of Homas). One day my fear proved right. Due to =\r\nheat of chimney, the cable\n&gt;&gt; of the Fan got burnt and there was a short-ci=\r\nrcuit. mccb tripped. Since then\n&gt;&gt; I am not using the Fan. You may have to =\r\ngo for Heat resistant cable for the\n&gt;&gt; FAN if you wish to use it but i am f=\r\nine without using the fan in my chimney.\n&gt;&gt; Actually without Fan, The whole=\r\n arrangement will become much Lighter and\n&gt;&gt; much easier to handle. Please =\r\nalso do not forget to make a support. You can\n&gt;&gt; see that in pictures which=\r\n I have loaded. Support is a separate part\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; (Please check the Picture =\r\nof Fan which i have added in the Photo section)\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; If you have further q=\r\nueries, please do not hesitate to ask.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Utpal\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Girish Sundaram &lt;gisundar@...&gt;\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n wrote:\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaskaram Phatakji,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; You know what I am faced with t=\r\nhe same problem that you had (and I am\n&gt;&gt; sure many\n&gt;&gt; &gt; others doing regul=\r\nar homam do)..

I\n&gt;&gt; rememb=\r\ner\n&gt;&gt; &gt; different fears i was having in my mind. I was then staying as a pa=\r\nying\n&gt;&gt; guest\n&gt;&gt; &gt; with a family. though i had a separte room, i was not su=\r\nre if they would\n&gt;&gt; allow\n&gt;&gt; &gt; me to do something related to fire. that was=\r\n the main worry. then there\n&gt;&gt; was self\n&gt;&gt; &gt; doubt concerning my ability to=\r\n perform Homam but I decided to perform\n&gt;&gt; and did\n&gt;&gt; &gt; the first Homam whi=\r\nch was Maha Ganapati homam on 1st day of Ashwin\n&gt;&gt; Navaraatri. I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; remem=\r\nber that i took me around 2.5 hours total including all the\n&gt;&gt; preparation\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; after that rest of the 8 days, i performed Chandi Homams. each Chandi\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; homam took\n&gt;&gt; &gt; around 4 hours. I remember that on the Ashtami day, some=\r\n of My\n&gt;&gt; colleagues with\n&gt;&gt; &gt; family came to see my chandi Homam and they =\r\ntold me that the smoke was\n&gt;&gt; even\n&gt;&gt; &gt; visible in the ground floor (The Ap=\r\nartment i was staying was on 4th) and\n&gt;&gt; there\n&gt;&gt; &gt; were nice smell every w=\r\nhere. The interesting thing is that Old lady of\n&gt;&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; family actually=\r\n co-operated with me. she used to help me in cutting Dray\n&gt;&gt; coconut\n&gt;&gt; &gt; i=\r\nn to small peices with knife. I cut my finger on several occasions\n&gt;&gt; while=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; &gt; cutting coconuts for chandi homam. I used to offer the blood stained\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; coconut\n&gt;&gt; &gt; peices in Chandi Homas.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; My all previous fears thu=\r\ns proved absolutely Non-existent. From the very\n&gt;&gt; first\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Homam, It was=\r\n a smooth ride. I was exahusted after Navaratri and could\n&gt;&gt; not\n&gt;&gt; &gt; conti=\r\nnue and there was a break of a week or so. Then again i started\n&gt;&gt; daily Ma=\r\nha\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Ganapti Homam while learnt the technic of breaking Dry coconut halv=\r\nes by\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; crushing it with both palms.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; After few months, I ha=\r\nd to look for another Sharing Apartment. I tried\n&gt;&gt; to search\n&gt;&gt; &gt; for it. =\r\nfew families rejected when i put the condition of doing Homam\n&gt;&gt; everyday.\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; at last One christian family agreed for that. I paid bigger amount but=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; they\n&gt;&gt; &gt; allowed me to do homam and i continued there for around 3 mon=\r\nths. during\n&gt;&gt; that\n&gt;&gt; &gt; time i also took vow to do homam and Chadni Path e=\r\nveryday for 1 year.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; after 3 months, i started searching for my ow=\r\nn separate Rental Apartment\n&gt;&gt; because\n&gt;&gt; &gt; my family was joining me. Again=\r\n the same concern (Prime) is to search\n&gt;&gt; for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Apartment where there is=\r\n no obstacle to do Homam. I got a brand new\n&gt;&gt; apartment. I\n&gt;&gt; &gt; observed t=\r\nhe flat and finalised the dealing. continued Homam every day\n&gt;&gt; for 1\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nyear. The whole flat became black. even the Home applicances liem\n&gt;&gt; refrig=\r\nerator\n&gt;&gt; &gt; etc.. were covered with black dust of Homa smoke. clothes in th=\r\ne\n&gt;&gt; wardrobe,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Openings of Central A/c etc... were all filled with bla=\r\nck dust. My whole\n&gt;&gt; brand\n&gt;&gt; &gt; new apartment became dark due to the Homam.=\r\n Smoke particles travelled to\n&gt;&gt; my\n&gt;&gt; &gt; lungs and throat and i started cou=\r\nghing badly. I suffered with severe\n&gt;&gt; Cough for\n&gt;&gt; &gt; many months and there=\r\n was pressure from near ones to stop Homam or\n&gt;&gt; atleast\n&gt;&gt; &gt; perform it on=\r\nce every week. But there was lot of determination provided\n&gt;&gt; by *some\n&gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n power* which i like to call as &quot;Mother&quot;.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; After 1 year in that Ap=\r\nartment, i started serching different place. I\n&gt;&gt; searched\n&gt;&gt; &gt; whole area =\r\nand was looking for a apartment which also has Balcony so\n&gt;&gt; that My\n&gt;&gt; &gt; h=\r\nomam goes smoothly without nmaking my whole aprtment look black and\n&gt;&gt; ther=\r\ne are\n&gt;&gt; &gt; no more complaints from my wife .\n&gt;&gt; &gt; I could not get one such =\r\nperfect place which gives me a Blacony and at\n&gt;&gt; the same\n&gt;&gt; &gt; time there a=\r\nre no buidlings in front which can observe me doing homam in\n&gt;&gt; balcony\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; and make a instant complaint to police and/or fire Brigade. Balcony was\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; very\n&gt;&gt; &gt; comfirtable and required option so that i can do it there and s=\r\nmoke\n&gt;&gt; handling\n&gt;&gt; &gt; becomes very easy but at the same time it is also tha=\r\nt much risky\n&gt;&gt; because any\n&gt;&gt; &gt; road-side person can complain seeing smoke=\r\n comming out.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Finally i got one aprtment without balcony but with a sp=\r\necial location.\n&gt;&gt; When i\n&gt;&gt; &gt; vacated the previous apartment, the owner&#39;e =\r\nrepresentative was\n&gt;&gt; shell-shocked\n&gt;&gt; &gt; looking at the condition of the ap=\r\nartment :) He told me over Phone -\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Aaap Kya\n&gt;&gt; &gt; karata tha flat me?&quot;. =\r\nHe then deducted 1000 AED from my deposit for the\n&gt;&gt; &gt; compensation. I happ=\r\nily agreed because i knew that it was a great deal\n&gt;&gt; instaed\n&gt;&gt; &gt; of going=\r\n to police station.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; &gt; In new Apartment (current one), security is v=\r\nery tight. But I decided to\n&gt;&gt; make an\n&gt;&gt; &gt; arrangement so that i do not *s=\r\npoil* condition of the Apartment. hence i\n&gt;&gt; came\n&gt;&gt; &gt; out with the Idea of=\r\n Chimney. (Please see the more pictures in photo\n&gt;&gt; section)\n&gt;&gt; &gt; and start=\r\ned doing Homam. Though the chimney is visible to neighbours and\n&gt;&gt; other\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; flat owners, no body has complained till now. neither to police nor to\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; security\n&gt;&gt; &gt; personnel. Only once Security person cautiuoned me. I stopp=\r\ned for a few\n&gt;&gt; days and\n&gt;&gt; &gt; started as usual. It is going on till today. =\r\nI do not know about\n&gt;&gt; tomorrow but i\n&gt;&gt; &gt; do not worry. becuase after 2.5 =\r\nyears of experience, it is more than\n&gt;&gt; clear to me\n&gt;&gt; &gt; that It is not I w=\r\nho is arranging all these but there is Mother behind\n&gt;&gt; all\n&gt;&gt; &gt; these. SHE=\r\n is making my road clear so that i can perform Homam as i\n&gt;&gt; wish.\n&gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; ***\n&gt;&gt; &gt; The moral of the story is that if you genuinely desire to perfor=\r\nm\n&gt;&gt; Homam/Havan,\n&gt;&gt; &gt; then It will be done. No obstacle will stand on your=\r\n way.\n&gt;&gt; &gt; Do not fear.

Even if you leave your room with &quot;Black Shades&qu=\r\not; would be fine and actually more beautiful :)&lt;br&gt;***&lt;br&gt;Answers to your =\r\nquestions:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;1) YES. It is portable. Every day I adjust it near my w=\r\nindow and after finishing homam, i take it back little inside so that windo=\r\nw can be closed. I am able to adjust it myself alone in just a few *seconds=\r\n*.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;2) It is made of G.I Sheets (Galvanized Iron) of 22 Gauge. This w=\r\nas manufactured by a Local EPC contracting company dealing in AC Duct insta=\r\nllation. A Technical Supervisor of that company is my close family friend. =\r\nHe did this for me. I suggest checking with any Restaurants. They all are h=\r\naving such arrangements and they would be able to help you to contact such =\r\nmanufacturers.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;3) YES, because it is a Metal (GI Sheet) it gets qu=\r\nite heated up. One can not touch during Homam. However, it also cools down =\r\nquickly. Within half an hour after Homam is finished, temperature of the ch=\r\nimney comes down to room temperature. &lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;4) It has a Metallic FAN at=\r\n the end. I was starting that FAN only when Fire goes of and lot of Smoke i=\r\ns generated. Reasons are as follows:&lt;br&gt;i)The fan is powerful and makes a l=\r\not of noise which disturbs concentration.&lt;br&gt;\n\nii) In the beginning, when F=\r\nire is very small, the powerful exhaust by the fan, disturbed the flames an=\r\nd sometimes extinguished it.&lt;br&gt;1ii) When Fire is there in the Homam, one n=\r\need not worry about smoke handling. the reason is that the smoke naturally =\r\ntravels upward and it is automatically guided to the exit of the chimney. O=\r\nnce the fire becomes strong, it generates vacuum around Homam kundam area a=\r\nnd starts pulling outside air. For instance, smoke from incense stick (Agar=\r\nbatti), though outside of chimney and quite far away, actually gets diverte=\r\nd into the Chimney via square opening at the bottom. Hence during homam, FA=\r\nN is not required.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;iv) Now very important thing. I used fan for ma=\r\nny months (only at the end of Homas). One day my fear proved right. Due to =\r\nheat of chimney, the cable of the Fan got burnt and there was a short-circu=\r\nit. mccb tripped. Since then I am not using the Fan. You may have to go for=\r\n Heat resistant cable for the FAN if you wish to use it but i am fine witho=\r\nut using the fan in my chimney.&lt;br&gt;\n\nActually without Fan, The whole arrang=\r\nement will become much Lighter and much easier to handle. Please also do no=\r\nt forget to make a support. You can see that in pictures which I have loade=\r\nd. Support is a separate part&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;(Please check the Picture of Fan whi=\r\nch i have added in the Photo section)&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If you have further queries, p=\r\nlease do not hesitate to ask.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best Regards,&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Utpal &lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nbr&gt;&lt;br&gt;--- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofo=\r\nllow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com&lt;/a&gt;, Girish Sundaram &=\r\nlt;gisundar@...&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; Namaskaram Phatakji,&lt;br&gt;&gt; You=\r\n know what I am faced with the same problem that you had (and I am sure man=\r\ny &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; others doing regular homam do)..

I remember &lt;br&gt;&gt; di=\r\nfferent fears i was having in my mind. I was then staying as a paying guest=\r\n &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; with a family. though i had a separte room, i was not sure if t=\r\nhey would allow &lt;br&gt;&gt; me to do something related to fire. that was the m=\r\nain worry. then there was self &lt;br&gt;&gt; doubt concerning my ability to perf=\r\norm Homam but I decided to perform and did &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; the first Homam which=\r\n was Maha Ganapati homam on 1st day of Ashwin Navaraatri. I &lt;br&gt;&gt; rememb=\r\ner that i took me around 2.5 hours total including all the preparation &lt;br&gt;=\r\n&gt; after that rest of the 8 days, i performed Chandi Homams. each Chandi =\r\nhomam took &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; around 4 hours. I remember that on the Ashtami day, s=\r\nome of My colleagues with &lt;br&gt;&gt; family came to see my chandi Homam and t=\r\nhey told me that the smoke was even &lt;br&gt;&gt; visible in the ground floor (T=\r\nhe Apartment i was staying was on 4th) and there &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; were nice smell=\r\n every where. The interesting thing is that Old lady of the &lt;br&gt;&gt; family=\r\n actually co-operated with me. she used to help me in cutting Dray coconut =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; in to small peices with knife. I cut my finger on several occasion=\r\ns while &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; cutting coconuts for chandi homam. I used to offer the b=\r\nlood stained coconut &lt;br&gt;&gt; peices in Chandi Homas.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; My a=\r\nll previous fears thus proved absolutely Non-existent. From the very first =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; Homam, It was a smooth ride. I was exahusted after Navaratri and c=\r\nould not &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; continue and there was a break of a week or so. Then ag=\r\nain i started daily Maha &lt;br&gt;&gt; Ganapti Homam while learnt the technic of=\r\n breaking Dry coconut halves by &lt;br&gt;&gt; crushing it with both palms.&lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; After few months, I had to look for another Sharing Apartment. =\r\nI tried to search &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; for it. few families rejected when i put the c=\r\nondition of doing Homam everyday. &lt;br&gt;&gt; at last One christian family agr=\r\need for that. I paid bigger amount but they &lt;br&gt;&gt; allowed me to do homam=\r\n and i continued there for around 3 months. during that &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; time i a=\r\nlso took vow to do homam and Chadni Path everyday for 1 year.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; after 3 months, i started searching for my own separate Rental Apartmen=\r\nt because &lt;br&gt;&gt; my family was joining me. Again the same concern (Prime)=\r\n is to search for &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; Apartment where there is no obstacle to do Hom=\r\nam. I got a brand new apartment. I &lt;br&gt;&gt; observed the flat and finalised=\r\n the dealing. continued Homam every day for 1 &lt;br&gt;&gt; year. The whole flat=\r\n became black. even the Home applicances liem refrigerator &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; etc..=\r\n were covered with black dust of Homa smoke. clothes in the wardrobe, &lt;br&gt;&=\r\ngt; Openings of Central A/c etc... were all filled with black dust. My whol=\r\ne brand &lt;br&gt;&gt; new apartment became dark due to the Homam. Smoke particle=\r\ns travelled to my &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; lungs and throat and i started coughing badly.=\r\n I suffered with severe Cough for &lt;br&gt;&gt; many months and there was pressu=\r\nre from near ones to stop Homam or atleast &lt;br&gt;&gt; perform it once every w=\r\neek. But there was lot of determination provided by *some &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; power*=\r\n which i like to call as &quot;Mother&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; After 1 year =\r\nin that Apartment, i started serching different place. I searched &lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\nwhole area and was looking for a apartment which also has Balcony so that M=\r\ny &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; homam goes smoothly without nmaking my whole aprtment look bla=\r\nck and there are &lt;br&gt;&gt; no more complaints from my wife .&lt;br&gt;&gt; I could=\r\n not get one such perfect place which gives me a Blacony and at the same &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; time there are no buidlings in front which can observe me doing homa=\r\nm in balcony &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; and make a instant complaint to police and/or fire =\r\nBrigade. Balcony was very &lt;br&gt;&gt; comfirtable and required option so that =\r\ni can do it there and smoke handling &lt;br&gt;&gt; becomes very easy but at the =\r\nsame time it is also that much risky because any &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; road-side perso=\r\nn can complain seeing smoke comming out.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Finally i got one aprtment=\r\n without balcony but with a special location. When i &lt;br&gt;&gt; vacated the p=\r\nrevious apartment, the owner&#39;e representative was shell-shocked &lt;br&gt;\n\n&=\r\ngt; looking at the condition of the apartment :) He told me over Phone - &q=\r\nuot;Aaap Kya &lt;br&gt;&gt; karata tha flat me?&quot;. He then deducted 1000 AED =\r\nfrom my deposit for the &lt;br&gt;&gt; compensation. I happily agreed because i k=\r\nnew that it was a great deal instaed &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; of going to police station.=\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; In new Apartment (current one), security is very tight. B=\r\nut I decided to make an &lt;br&gt;&gt; arrangement so that i do not *spoil* condi=\r\ntion of the Apartment. hence i came &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; out with the Idea of Chimney=\r\n. (Please see the more pictures in photo section) &lt;br&gt;&gt; and started doin=\r\ng Homam. Though the chimney is visible to neighbours and other &lt;br&gt;&gt; fla=\r\nt owners, no body has complained till now. neither to police nor to securit=\r\ny &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; personnel. Only once Security person cautiuoned me. I stopped =\r\nfor a few days and &lt;br&gt;&gt; started as usual. It is going on till today. I =\r\ndo not know about tomorrow but i &lt;br&gt;&gt; do not worry. becuase after 2.5 y=\r\nears of experience, it is more than clear to me &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; that It is not I=\r\n who is arranging all these but there is Mother behind all &lt;br&gt;&gt; these. =\r\nSHE is making my road clear so that i can perform Homam as i wish.&lt;br&gt;&gt; =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; ***&lt;br&gt;&gt; The moral of the story is that if you genuinely desire=\r\n to perform Homam/Havan, &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; then It will be done. No obstacle will =\r\nstand on your way.&lt;br&gt;&gt; Do not fear. All the fears will break like Papad=\r\ns once you start walking over &lt;br&gt;&gt; them to do homam. i can swear for it=\r\n!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; No owner will kick you out, No neighbour will call 9-1-1=\r\n and even if that &lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt; happens, there will open a way!&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; Best Regards,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; Utpal&lt;br&gt;&gt; PS: Forgive me for spelling=\r\ns and Grammar! &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;a href=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40ya=\r\nhoogroups.com&quot; rel=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.=\r\ncom&lt;/a&gt;, &quot;astro_student75&quot; &lt;astro.sishya@&gt; wrote:&lt;br&gt;\n\n&gt;=\r\n &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Utpal Ji,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Thanks very much fo=\r\nr the photo.
