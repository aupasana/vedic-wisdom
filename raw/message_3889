All this happ=\r\nened because the newspaper reported that\npeople will prefer Stalin(karunani=\r\ndhi&#39;s IInd son) rather than Alagiri.\nThis dayanidhi maran went on TV saying=\r\n that perpetrators of this \nviolence will be dealt with strongly as per law=\r\n.

I do not wish to deviate the discussion but interesti=\r\nng piece of tidbit.Sun tv which brought out the clip is owned by dayanidhi =\r\nmaran brother of Karunanidhi ( Supremo DMK which is a carbon copy of Commun=\r\nist ideology) and in today&#39;s speech he used the cover of this occasion to o=\r\nnce again lash out at dharma.\n\nThe same Karunanidhi also lashed out at Kanc=\r\nhi Peethadhipathi when the fiasco was ongoing. Hindu newspaper which is pra=\r\nised by normal people as unbiased was writing articles every day with so ca=\r\nlled details of misgivings at the ashram....Sense a pattern ...That is the =\r\nmedia war of modern India controlled by vested interests who would love to =\r\nsee an hindu sanyasi get insulted.Also stakeholders in this drama are the m=\r\nissionary orgs.\n\n2.In Nithyananda&#39; s defense he never said he was god . He =\r\nalso never encouraged one to turn away from sex. His advice was very simple=\r\n ...when in the physical act keep it physical.As long as fantasies are not =\r\ninvolved it does not become a addiction. \n\nHe could very well be repaying a=\r\n rna ...or might be involved in a sexual ritual. \n\nTwo of his gurus were an=\r\n old woman and a female tantrik which he mentions in his youtube video on d=\r\nivine consciousness and feminity.\n\n3.Like Narasimha ji pointed out , he has=\r\n a very good way of explaining higher level truths.\n\nWhat he did or did not=\r\n do is only his karma alone .This does not take away anything from his lect=\r\nures or messages.\n\nand like Utpal ji rightly pointed out...When we are prep=\r\nared to sit on a high moral horse to judge others...we better be prepared w=\r\nhen the divine mother tests us.By juding we will incurr a share of the karm=\r\na others committed and also will be judged quite harshly when our turn come=\r\ns.\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;=\r\nvedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; Narasim=\r\nha aptly worte:\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt;No matter how much one has read, no matter how much o=\r\nne has &gt;understood, no matter how much sadhana one has done, no matter how =\r\n&gt;many good karmas one has done, no matter what spiritual experiences &gt;one h=\r\nad, no matter how blissful one feels during meditation or most &gt;of the time=\r\n, no matter how elevated one is spiritually, one can &gt;still fall. \n&gt; \n&gt; I l=\r\nearnt a very good thing today from Narasimha&#39;s message.

Period.\n&gt; \n&gt; ***\n&gt; You have passio=\r\nnately raised some questions in defense and i find nothing wrong in it but =\r\nOne thing i wish to pin point and that is the Pain of embarrassment such ep=\r\nisodes gives to follower of Sanaatan Dharma. There may not be anything wron=\r\ng, if a Saadhu which is very popular on TV, Media and having a great many f=\r\nollowers, enjoys sexual pleasures but at the same time he preaches the same=\r\n and does not hide it. If someone preaches sublime knowledge and talk about=\r\n Brahmacharya but if he/she does not admit own weakness, it is a gross.\n&gt; I=\r\n whole heartedly respect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extremely trut=\r\nhful in his &#39;Satyana Prayogo&#39; about his own weakness and his struggles on s=\r\nexual matters. It is a rarest of rare frankness for a person of such a stat=\r\nure in society. He really was a Saadhu.\n&gt; \n&gt; There is a big difference betw=\r\neen fall of a Popular Spiritual Master and a normal person. If Sri Sri Ravi=\r\nshankar didn&#39;t fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big embarrass=\r\nment for us, then a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spiritual Master, in =\r\nfront of the whole world is even bigger pain and embarrassment. It is a big=\r\nger blow to faiths of general public.\n&gt; \n&gt; I am not specific on Satyananda =\r\nhere because i do not know if it is really true.\n&gt; \n&gt; If the footage is rig=\r\nht, then i fancy here that such shocks and shameful episodes are needed to =\r\nsteer clear Sanaatan Dharma. The Mother may be pushing such bitter pills so=\r\n that corruption is finally controlled and reduced to very minimum.\n&gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nFurther, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so &gt;twisted an=\r\nd \n&gt; \n&gt; You have spoken the truth. The world today is many times more tempt=\r\ning then say even 100 years back. It is better to be a married person (Even=\r\n for a very elavated soul like Vivekananda if comes back) and overcome the =\r\npleasure/pains of sexual desires.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, i would say that its high t=\r\nime for Big names and even Bigger claims Spiritual Masters start taking a l=\r\neaf out of Vimalananda or Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s bold approach to the subject of =\r\nphysical and mental Sex (Which is *One of the* prilimianry steps in final B=\r\nrahmacharya. )\n&gt; \n&gt; It reminds me of Sant Tukaaram&#39;s famous line\n&gt; &quot;Jaisa B=\r\nole Taisa Chale tyaachi Vandaavi Paule&quot;\n&gt; \n&gt; Best Regards,\n&gt; \n&gt; Utpal \n&gt; \n&gt;=\r\n --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wrote=\r\n:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I too believe we should give the be=\r\nnefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda. There are some questions one has to ask=\r\n here:\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 1) How reliable is vedio. Tehelka, which did th=\r\ne sting operation,=C3=82=C2=A0is a VERY questionable organization.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 2) Second, how does one know whether Swami Nityananda was not=\r\n practising say some sexual ritual?\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; 3) What exactly is=\r\n the big fuss if a Swami, and a reasonable good one, has sex with someone?\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; We live in such times where Mahamaya has made it almos=\r\nt impossible for even VERY advanced souls to remain perfect brahmacharis fr=\r\nom birth till death. Souls who might have been brahmacharis in all previous=\r\n births, would=C3=82=C2=A0probably=C3=82=C2=A0 not be able to remain so whe=\r\nn born in thid age=C3=82=C2=A0is a simple fact of nature, otherwise how els=\r\ne is Kali Yuga to be different from other yugas? She wants it that way and =\r\nso it is that way.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the ka=\r\nrmas and rnas have become so twisted and complex that untill you pay back t=\r\nhe rnas, it will keep hounding you. How is one going to overcome that? Our =\r\nsociety too is steeped in unnecessary prudishness and misconceptions about =\r\nlust and spirituality. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; All said and done, Vimalanada =\r\n- whom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints who lived - took 6 years=\r\n of struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sadhus and saints?=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that Swami Nityana=\r\nnda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to come, the idea=\r\n of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God as his/her gur=\r\nu and keep doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way. In=\r\n this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keeps doing homas fo=\r\nr some years. \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &quot;Between me and You, t=\r\nhere is only me.\n&gt; &gt; Take away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; --- On Thu, 4/3/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; From: N=\r\narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: Sex scandals by spi=\r\nritual gurus\n&gt; &gt; To: vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com\n&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 M=\r\narch, 2010, 8:26 AM\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0 \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Namaste =\r\nKK,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; No matter how genuine the video may look, let us give the bene=\r\nfit of doubt to Paramahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to conclusions as some=\r\none said.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; *Even if* his expose on video is genuine,=\r\n it is only a reminder that nobody is free from Mahamaya&#39;s web.

I do not wish to deviate=\r\n the discussion but interesting piece of tidbit.Sun tv which brought out th=\r\ne clip is owned by dayanidhi maran brother of Karunanidhi ( Supremo DMK whi=\r\nch is a carbon copy of Communist ideology) and in today&#39;s speech he used th=\r\ne cover of this occasion to once again lash out at dharma.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;The same =\r\nKarunanidhi also lashed out at Kanchi Peethadhipathi when the fiasco was on=\r\ngoing. Hindu newspaper which is praised by normal people as unbiased\n was w=\r\nriting articles every day with so called details of misgivings at the ashra=\r\nm....Sense a pattern ...That is the media war of modern India controlled by=\r\n vested interests who would love to see an hindu sanyasi get insulted.Also =\r\nstakeholders in this drama are the missionary orgs.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;2.In Nithyananda=\r\n&#39; s defense he never said he was god . He also never encouraged one to turn=\r\n away from sex. His advice was very simple ...when in the physical act keep=\r\n it physical.As long as fantasies are not involved it does not become a add=\r\niction. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;He could very well be repaying a rna ...or might be involve=\r\nd in a sexual ritual. &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Two of his gurus were an old woman and a fema=\r\nle tantrik which he mentions in his youtube video on divine consciousness a=\r\nnd feminity.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;3.Like Narasimha ji pointed out , he has a very good wa=\r\ny of explaining higher level truths.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;What he did or did not do is on=\r\nly his karma alone .This does not take away anything from his\n lectures or =\r\nmessages.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;and like Utpal ji rightly pointed out...When we are prepar=\r\ned to sit on a high moral horse to judge others...we better be prepared whe=\r\nn the divine mother tests us.By juding we will incurr a share of the karma =\r\nothers committed and also will be judged quite harshly when our turn comes.=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Regards&lt;BR&gt;Vemparla Ram Kishore &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us=\r\n.mc245.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; targe=\r\nt=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;=\r\n&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;, &quot;vedic_pathak&quot; &lt;vedic_pathak@ ...&g=\r\nt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Rajarshi,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Narasimha aptl=\r\ny worte:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;No matter how much one has read, no matter ho=\r\nw much one has &gt;understood, no matter how much sadhana one has done, no =\r\nmatter how &gt;many good karmas one has done, no matter what spiritual expe=\r\nriences &gt;one had, no matter how blissful one feels during\n meditation or=\r\n most &gt;of the time, no matter how elevated one is spiritually, one can &=\r\ngt;still fall. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I learnt a very good thing today from Nara=\r\nsimha&#39;s message.

Period.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; ***&lt;BR&gt;&gt; You have passionately raised some qu=\r\nestions in defense and i find nothing wrong in it but One thing i wish to p=\r\nin point and that is the Pain of embarrassment such episodes gives to follo=\r\nwer of Sanaatan Dharma. There may not be anything wrong, if a Saadhu which =\r\nis very popular on TV, Media and having a great many followers, enjoys sexu=\r\nal pleasures but at the same time he preaches the same and does not hide it=\r\n. If someone preaches sublime knowledge and talk about Brahmacharya but if =\r\nhe/she does not admit own weakness, it is a gross.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I whole heartedl=\r\ny respect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extremely truthful in his &#39;Sa=\r\ntyana Prayogo&#39; about his own weakness and his\n struggles on sexual matters.=\r\n It is a rarest of rare frankness for a person of such a stature in society=\r\n. He really was a Saadhu.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; There is a big difference betwee=\r\nn fall of a Popular Spiritual Master and a normal person. If Sri Sri Ravish=\r\nankar didn&#39;t fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big embarrassme=\r\nnt for us, then a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spiritual Master, in fr=\r\nont of the whole world is even bigger pain and embarrassment. It is a bigge=\r\nr blow to faiths of general public.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; I am not specific on S=\r\natyananda here because i do not know if it is really true.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n If the footage is right, then i fancy here that such shocks and shameful e=\r\npisodes are needed to steer clear Sanaatan Dharma. The Mother may be pushin=\r\ng such bitter pills so that corruption is finally controlled and reduced to=\r\n very minimum.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karma=\r\ns and rnas have become so &gt;twisted\n and &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; You have spoke=\r\nn the truth. The world today is many times more tempting then say even 100 =\r\nyears back. It is better to be a married person (Even for a very elavated s=\r\noul like Vivekananda if comes back) and overcome the pleasure/pains of sexu=\r\nal desires.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Finally, i would say that its high time for Bi=\r\ng names and even Bigger claims Spiritual Masters start taking a leaf out of=\r\n Vimalananda or Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s bold approach to the subject of physical a=\r\nnd mental Sex (Which is *One of the* prilimianry steps in final Brahmachary=\r\na. )&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; It reminds me of Sant Tukaaram&#39;s famous line&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&quot;Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tyaachi Vandaavi Paule&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Best Regar=\r\nds,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- In &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://us.mc=\r\n245.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; target=\r\n=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot;&gt;=\r\nvedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;,\n rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt; wr=\r\note:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; I too believe we should give the benefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda. =\r\nThere are some questions one has to ask here:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; 1) How reliable is vedio. Tehelka, which did the sting operation,=\r\n=C3=82&nbsp;is a VERY questionable organization.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt; &gt; 2) Second, how does one know whether Swami Nityananda was not =\r\npractising say some sexual ritual?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; 3=\r\n) What exactly is the big fuss if a Swami, and a reasonable good one, has s=\r\nex with someone?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; We live in such tim=\r\nes where Mahamaya has made it almost impossible for even VERY advanced soul=\r\ns to remain perfect brahmacharis from birth till death. Souls who might hav=\r\ne been brahmacharis in all previous births, would=C3=82&nbsp;probably=C3=82=\r\n&nbsp; not be able to remain so when born in thid\n age=C3=82&nbsp;is a simp=\r\nle fact of nature, otherwise how else is Kali Yuga to be different from oth=\r\ner yugas? She wants it that way and so it is that way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have be=\r\ncome so twisted and complex that untill you pay back the rnas, it will keep=\r\n hounding you. How is one going to overcome that? Our society too is steepe=\r\nd in unnecessary prudishness and misconceptions about lust and spirituality=\r\n. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; All said and done, Vimalanada - w=\r\nhom I consider to be one of the greatest Saints who lived - took 6 years of=\r\n struggle to overcome lust. What to speak of ordianry sadhus and saints?&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; And finally, it is q&#92;uite possible tha=\r\nt Swami Nityananda *maybe* a fake guru. We do not know. But in the times to=\r\n come, the idea of running after a guru will change. Each one must take God=\r\n as his/her guru and keep doing sadhana and Nature will\n teach in the best =\r\npossible way. In this regard, fire can act as an excellent guru if one keep=\r\ns doing homas for some years. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; -Rega=\r\nrds&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt=\r\n; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\n&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Take away the me, s=\r\no only You remain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; --- On Thu, 4/3/10, =\r\nNarasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &=\r\ngt; From: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdo=\r\nm] Re: Sex scandals by spiritual gurus&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; To: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://u=\r\ns.mc245.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dvedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&quot; targ=\r\net=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow\n ymailto=3D&quot;mailto:vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.co=\r\nm&quot;&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Date: Thursday, 4 March,=\r\n 2010, 8:26 AM&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste KK,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; No matter how genuine the video may look, let us give the ben=\r\nefit of doubt to Paramahamsa Nithyananda and not jump to conclusions as som=\r\neone said.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; *Eve=\r\nn if* his expose on video is genuine, it is only a reminder that nobody is =\r\nfree from Mahamaya&#39;s web.

If one allows self-consciousness, ego and=\r\n pride to take root in one&#39;s mind, one thing leads to another and one falls=\r\n in the web of Mahamaya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; Even if a spiritual master really had weaknesses and fell, we do =\r\nnot benefit whatsoever by discussing those weaknesses.
