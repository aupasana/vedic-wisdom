Suppose someone is doing the complete purscharan =A0o=\r\nf mantra, is to wrong =A0not to expect something amazing might happen at th=\r\ne end of it.\n\nSome years ago there was a Hindi author who was well off and =\r\nhad a Temple in their home for several generations. Something happened in t=\r\nhis authors life and he felt lot of trauma and could not find mental peace.=\r\n In his later life he took up doing prayers and japa etc as he was taught i=\r\nn his younger days. One night his daughter said to him, you are doing so mu=\r\nch prayers etc, have you had any experiences.\n\nThe author became upset and =\r\nsaid, no, he had not any experiences. Many times he thinks that he is sitin=\r\ng in front of a stone in the temple and it is all useless. But he will not =\r\ngive up his prayers as his time is coming nearer.\nNext morning when this au=\r\nthor was in his Temple and priest was doing ManglaAarti, The Deity\nSpoke to=\r\n him and comforted him.\n\n=A0Several days later when he went to a famous Tem=\r\nple in Rajasthan, again the Divine Lord spoke to him there and comforted hi=\r\nm and said there is no difference between Him and Deities in his home Templ=\r\ne.\n\nWhen I read this story I knew immediately it was a true story. Very sim=\r\nilar things have happened with me to help me and comfort me.=A0\n\nWe are goi=\r\nng from A to B. Is it a relentless journey? Are there no breaks, petrol sta=\r\ntions or shops where we can get out and stretch ourselves. Are there any ro=\r\nad signs. Spiritual experiences are like these. They guide us and show us i=\r\nf we are on a right path.\n\nI was thinking of writing to this devotee who ha=\r\nd this powerful experience in Temple. Please write about it. What you exper=\r\nienced and what really happened. It will give knowledge to others. But then=\r\n I realised that I am a lone ranger here and many times go against the stre=\r\nam.\n\n=A0Many people are very young here and take NarasimhaBhai as their gur=\r\nu or spiritual adviser. So if guruji is saying something, chela and clients=\r\n cannot go against it. Othewise their fire-pot, ghee-pot and coco-pot will =\r\nbe confiscated.=A0\n\nI was also like this in my life. I took diksha=A0 from =\r\nmy Late Uncle who was famous in his days.\nWhen I tried to talk to him about=\r\n Darshan of Divine Lord, he became very negative and said it is not possibl=\r\ne. I kept very quite. I did not try to give examples of saints like Tulsida=\r\ns or others who had Darshan. I had not done any spiritual sadhana and so no=\r\n personal experiences.\n.=A0\nSince then my life has changed due to different=\r\n spiritual experiences. Sure I am still in lot of pain and not in a complet=\r\ne bliss all the the time but I know Divine Beings can very easily give Dars=\r\nhan And having spiritual experiences are very helpful for spiritual growth.=\r\n\n\nThanks\nLaxmiNarayan\r\n---586199313-51799281-1347879417=:3752\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=iso-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;color:#000; background-color:#fff; font-family:ta=\r\nhoma, new york, times, serif;font-size:10pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv453005168&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;=\r\n&lt;div style=3D&quot;color: rgb(0, 0, 0); background-color: rgb(255, 255, 255); fo=\r\nnt-family: tahoma, &#39;new york&#39;, times, serif; &quot;&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv453005168yui_3=\r\n_2_0_18_134779697887642&quot;&gt;Hi,&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div id=3D&quot;yiv453005168yui_3_2_0_18_13477=\r\n9697887642&quot;&gt;&nbsp; &nbsp; I still cannot understand why it is wrong to have=\r\n a spiritual experiences or to think about them.
