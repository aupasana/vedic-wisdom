I wonder if the karmin debts=\r\n payback between exact two souls. If A does some thing to B, does B has to =\r\ndo the same thing to A in future?\n\nDoes not the karma be passed on to the h=\r\neirs (I do not mean heirs in strict sense)?\n\n2. Do not the karma aggregate =\r\nin any way? Let us say, A steals X amount from B, and C steals Y amount fro=\r\nm A.\n\nIn future B if B steals X-Y from A and Y from C, the karmic debts are=\r\n paid back in totality. Is this a possibility?\n\n3. If A is trying to cheat =\r\nme, it can be:\n   I cheated him in my past births and hence he is trying to=\r\n payback.\n   This could be a brand new cycle.\n\nIn any case, if I know he co=\r\nuld cheat me, and I have a way to avoid getting cheated, what should I do?\n=\r\n\nCheating has not significant if I do not feel sad. After all what is the d=\r\nefinition of cheating? It may be much easier to cheat with out sense of doe=\r\nrship as compared to getting cheated. One just have to strongly believe, it=\r\n is God giving him the opportunity to cheat others. I wonder if doing wrong=\r\n thing even with out sense of doership is acceptible?\n\n4. Even the God coul=\r\nd not escape the karma. Rama killed Vali from hiding, and he got the karma =\r\nphalam from Angada who is reborn as hunter when Rama is reborn as Krishna. =\r\nSo, the karmic transactions may not be resticted betwween the same parties.=\r\n\n\nVishnu had to take the karma phala as Rama and be away from his wife.\nSo,=\r\n the not having the sense of ownership may not be the only factor.\n5.  Vive=\r\nkananda talks about unattached karma and niskama karma. A terrorist may be =\r\ndoing unattached karma as he believes God wants him and makes him do what h=\r\ne does. He/she may be unattached the consequences of what they do. How ever=\r\n, they have a strong desire to go to heaver as they believe strongly that G=\r\nod will grant them heaven.\n\n6. With all the explanation, I am not clear how=\r\n Sadhana can burn the karma faster and how we can take others karma phala.\n=\r\n\nBest regards,\nVijay\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;utpal pathak&quot; &lt;v=\r\nedic_pathak@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Narasimha & Rajarshi,\n&gt; \n&gt; I wish to ad=\r\nd or say Echo the same thing in different words.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please Consider this =\r\n-\n&gt; \n&gt; A Cheats B (Say for the instance that Cycle started now)\n&gt; Next time=\r\n B gets the oppotunity and strong desire to cheat A and B does it with sens=\r\ne of EGO and enjoys that rvenge.\n&gt; Now if A accepts it calmly and naturally=\r\n without any sadness and without any emotions of hatred towards B -Now then=\r\n i feel that A is out of the perticular cycle but what about B.

Nature has created a \n&gt; &gt; situation where it can be =\r\npaid back. In other words, Nature has placed that \n&gt; &gt; person in a position=\r\n to cheat or hurt you and tempted him to do so.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (2) That person ha=\r\ns succumbed to the temptation, i.e. he has used the \n&gt; &gt; opportunity provid=\r\ned by Nature. He cheats or hurts you. As he engages in the \n&gt; &gt; action whil=\r\ne identifying with the action (&quot;I am doing it&quot;), he now gets a \n&gt; &gt; new kar=\r\nma. He will be paid back later.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Both are correct. From his perspec=\r\ntive, he is doing it with identification \n&gt; &gt; and he is incurring a new kar=\r\nma. From your perspective, you are being paid \n&gt; &gt; back for what you did be=\r\nfore.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; In order to break out of this cycle, accept i=\r\nt when somebody does something \n&gt; &gt; to you. Do not hate the person or pity =\r\nyourself. Don&#39;t think &quot;why does it \n&gt; &gt; have to happen to me&quot;. Think only a=\r\nbout your current action (&quot;what is the \n&gt; &gt; best thing for me to do NOW?&quot;) =\r\nand do NOT think about what happened, why it \n&gt; &gt; happened, who did it and =\r\nhow things happening to you are unfair.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; The tricky thing is when N=\r\nature places you in a position to pay back \n&gt; &gt; somebody else&#39;s bad karma a=\r\nnd creates a strong temptation for you to do so. \n&gt; &gt; You may feel a sudden=\r\n urge from inside to do a bad thing to someone! But \n&gt; &gt; remember one thing=\r\n. Any thought or action with a sense of doership (&quot;I am \n&gt; &gt; doing&quot;) will c=\r\nreate a new karma, even if the other person brought it on \n&gt; &gt; himself with=\r\n a previous action.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If you can engage in an action without a sense=\r\n of doership and surrendering \n&gt; &gt; the action to the Lord completely, you w=\r\nill not incur karma. But that is \n&gt; &gt; very very difficult - almost impossib=\r\nle for most. Of course, you can also \n&gt; &gt; postpone the payback through the =\r\nuse of your *will power*, i.e. avoid the \n&gt; &gt; temptation and not do the bad=\r\n thing to the other person. As long as we live \n&gt; &gt; in a body, some karmas =\r\nwill need to be incurred. But good discretion, \n&gt; &gt; self-control and strong=\r\n will power will enable one to postpone the most \n&gt; &gt; troublesome karmas to=\r\n a later time.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; When the reactions to your previous karmas are paid=\r\n back and through who is \n&gt; &gt; not in YOUR control. Nature and the will powe=\r\nr of others decide that. So you \n&gt; &gt; can do nothing except accept what come=\r\ns. But what you DO NOW is to a large \n&gt; &gt; extent under your control. Use yo=\r\nur will power to do the right things.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; Do=\r\n a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; Do Pitr=\r\ni Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; Spiritual=\r\nity: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish lessons=\r\n (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish software (Win=\r\ndows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) websi=\r\nte: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; ------------ --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- - \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; From=\r\n: &quot;kritels&quot; &lt;kritels@grouply. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; Sent: Sunday, April 26, 2009 2:19 PM\n&gt; &gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re: H=\r\now Karma Works\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Narasimha Garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks you for th=\r\ne beautiful explanation.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I&#39;m not very clear on some of the poin=\r\nts you have mentioned:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; is it that everything that is happening =\r\nto us in this life is all reaction \n&gt; &gt; &gt; to some of our past actions?it is=\r\n difficult for me to understand this.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; To me, it can also be that some=\r\none is pushing this suffering onto us as \n&gt; &gt; &gt; his action than a reaction =\r\nof our old karmas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; In any case, if we are getting cheated and we know=\r\n it clearly why should \n&gt; &gt; &gt; we sit back and just let things happen agains=\r\nt us, why should we not fight \n&gt; &gt; &gt; back?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks\n&gt; &gt; &gt; KK\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, &quot;Narasimha P.V.R.

You are being pushed now. That is \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; reaction. How you=\r\n take this push and whether you resist or not has \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; nothing to do wit=\r\nh the old action and reaction balance. IF you resist and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; apply some=\r\n force NOW, it becomes a new action which will get its reaction \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; lat=\r\ner.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Even a person of a high level of ment=\r\nal equanimity and stability does \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; have an ego. Each living person ha=\r\ns a limited ego (I-ness) which binds \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; him to a body and an identity =\r\n(e.g. PVR Narasimha Rao, who looks like \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; this, who knows so and so t=\r\nhings, who does so and so things, who wants so \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; and so things, who i=\r\ns the husband of Padmaja, who is the father of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sriharini and Srihar=\r\nish, who is the sishya of Manish Pandit etc etc). If \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the binding is=\r\n completely removed and one becomes completely unbound from \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; that li=\r\nmited sense of I-ness, one will no longer remain in the body. So \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; an=\r\ny embodied being must have a limited ego (I-ness). As one dies and gets \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; reborn, this ego (sense of I-ness) is cut off from one body and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; environment and re-attached to another body and environment. Nature \n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt;&gt; tracks this change. Just as post office delivers all mail addressed to \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your old apartment to your new apartment when you change address, Na=\r\nture \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; delivers the reactions of all previous life actions to the sen=\r\nse of \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; I-ness in this life.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As long as one is embodied=\r\n and has a sense of I-ness, Nature will \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; continue to deliver the rea=\r\nctions to various previous actions from that \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; being. Death of wife i=\r\nn an accident, getting an Oscar award, losing an \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; election, being cr=\r\niticized by thousand people, being hit by wife, being \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; abused by hus=\r\nband, being killed by a brother, being cheated by a friend \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; etc etc =\r\nare examples of reactions to previous actions. As long as one&#39;s \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; sen=\r\nse of I-ness is bound to a body, Nature will continue to deliver \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; re=\r\nactions to previous actions. If one gets an Oscar award as a result of \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt;&gt; previous good karma, it is not necessary that one should be happy or \n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; excited or elated. Do not think that a reaction from Nature to one&#39;s =\r\ngood \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction makes one happy. How=\r\n one feels \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; NOW is irrelevant. If one is cheated, it is not necessar=\r\ny that one should \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; feel sad or angry. Do not think that a reaction f=\r\nrom Nature to one&#39;s bad \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; karma is meaningful only if that reaction d=\r\nisappoints him. You cheated \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; someone. Nature will arrange such that =\r\nthat person cheats you now. How \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you feel about it now is not releva=\r\nnt as far as the old action-reaction \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; equation is concerned. Thus, b=\r\neing equanimous, equal-minded and calm does \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; not stop Nature from do=\r\ning its job.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; In fact, it is better that way. By not reacting =\r\nto what is happening now, \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; one is preventing new karmas. Suppose you=\r\n cheated a person in a previous \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; life. Suppose Nature arranged for t=\r\nhat person to cheat you now. His \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; cheating you is merely a reaction =\r\nto your own action (but if he does it \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; with self-identification with=\r\n the action, it becomes a new karma for that \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; person. But, that is i=\r\nrrelevant to you). If you just face it calmly and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; without doing any=\r\nthing, you finish off your karmic debt. Instead, suppose \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; you fight =\r\nand try to stop the person from cheating you. Then your current \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; act=\r\nions would become a NEW karma and you will have to face its reaction \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; later. If you want to pay off old debts without incurring new ones, you \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; have to behave like the person you described below. Accept whatever =\r\ncomes \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; your way with neither happiness nor sadness, but with a calm =\r\nand relaxed \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; mind. On top of it, keep doing what seems like the righ=\r\nt thing to do at \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; the moment, with as little self-identification (se=\r\nnse of &quot;I am doing \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; this&quot;) as possible. As you become better at this=\r\n, your instincts and \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; judgment will guide you better and show you th=\r\ne right action.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; -------=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short=\r\n Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tar=\r\npanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Spiritualit=\r\ny: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish lesson=\r\ns (MP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish software =\r\n(Windows): http://www.VedicAst rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC=\r\n) website: http://www.SriJagan nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ------------ --------- -----=\r\n---- --------- --------- --------- - \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message =\r\n----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Thursday, April 23, 2009 1:02 PM\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Subject: Karma\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Dear Narsimhaji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; How does one burn their =\r\nkarmas if they are able to be in a neutral \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; frame\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of mind=\r\n and not be affected by what is percieved as misfortune?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; =\r\nA close family friend of ours lost his wife in a road accident a few \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n&gt; &gt; years\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; ago.

Right before t=\r\nhe accident, his wife told him of her \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; recent\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; meditation =\r\nexperience and that she would probably be leaving her body\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; soon. h=\r\ner husband never shed a tear and was in the utmost calm and\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; cheerf=\r\nul frame of mind even during the funeral process. Some folks felt \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;=\r\n it\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; to be a bit odd. He is a highly educated professor with a stab=\r\nle mind. \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; His\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; wife and he shared a very high spiritual an=\r\nd mental bond and they have \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; two\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; teenage sons. I have the=\r\n utmost reverance towards him and also in awe \n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; his spi=\r\nritual level. My question is how would his karmas be burnt if he\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; n=\r\never feels the pain of such a perceived tragedy?\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Regards,=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;name deleted for privacy&gt;\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;       Now surf faster an=\r\nd smarter !
