The reason being I will be =\r\nhonest in this God&#39;s place. Unlike you all who are determined to give yours=\r\nelves to the Lord I am not ready for extreme level of spirituality.I like p=\r\nraying god but don&#39;t want to commit saying that I don&#39;t want any riches,any=\r\n happiness etc. \n&gt; \n&gt; I don&#39;t want to go for something in an extreme level =\r\nand later face the wrath of God. So my question is I believe purnahuti is t=\r\nhe part where one surrenders completely and gives this commitment. I want t=\r\no call god in fire pray, meditate keep it simple. As fire is the most auspi=\r\ncious form I am tempted to pray God in that medium. So can I skip the purna=\r\nhuti section. Do I need to make any changes in sankalpam? \n&gt; \n&gt; Thanks and =\r\nregards,\n&gt; Pratima\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;naaraay=\r\nana_iyer&quot; &lt;narayan.iyer@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Shri Utpal,\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; This =\r\nis just wonderful !!!
