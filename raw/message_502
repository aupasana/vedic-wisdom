He took&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Maha samadhi in Bombay and his Samadhi is located in Phuskar &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Rajasthan.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Babaji is also know as Ranchod Dasji Maharaj, Paramhans of &lt;br&gt;&gt; Chirtakut &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; and some more names too. He was a Maharatrian Deshasth brahmin by &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; birth and was born in Gwailor district in MP.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Ranchod Dasji Maharaj name was given to him by his disciples in &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Gujarat.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; He may have lived for 700 plus years.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; He ran away from home at a very tender age and was taken up a &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; disciple by Bala Krishna Dasji also known as Paihari Baba.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Paihari baba was also very releaized, he only drank milk and so &lt;br&gt;the &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; name. Paihari Baba was Gujarati by birth but spoke in Hindi.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Paihari Baba lived in Kulu for a long time, than in Pushkar, he &lt;br&gt;was\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; in Pushkar when the temple of Srinathji was moved from Mathura to &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Rajasthan. At that time he did a lot of seva of lord Krishna in &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Pushkar. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; After that he lived in Galtaji near jaipur in Rajasthan. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Babaji also lived in Galtaji for about 12 years and he had the &lt;br&gt;&gt; vision &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; of Lord Rama in the same cave, that exists today too.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; It is located a few miles from Jaipur, there are a few temples &lt;br&gt;&gt; there &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; near the cave. I have visited this cave too.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; From Galtaji Paihari Baba moved to Revasa and than to Kashmir &lt;br&gt;where &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; he lived in a place called &quot;Rasayani Gufa&quot;.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Paihari Baba also may have lived for 500 plus years too.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; While at Galtaji, the Famous Tulsidas maharaj had visited Paihari &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Baba and give a hand written manuscipt of\n Ramayana.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; They belong to the Ramanandi Sampradaya who has Lord Ram and &lt;br&gt;&gt; Goddess &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Sita devi as ishta devata. Ramanandi Sampardaya came as an &lt;br&gt;offshot &lt;br&gt;&gt; of &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Ramanuja Sampradaya.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Babaji or Ranchod Dasji Maharaj lived for many years in Bengal, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Chitrakot and Also visited Gujarat. He also stayed in Kashmir.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; One of the kings of Kashmir was a devout disciple of Paihari Baba.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Both Babaji and Paihari Baba were adept in &quot;kaya kalpa&quot; and&lt;br&gt;they &lt;br&gt;&gt; also &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; had strong connection with saints located in Tibet.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Paihari Baba used to remain in samadhi at a stretch for 2 to 3 &lt;br&gt;&gt; years.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Paihari Baba as a young brahamchari served also Swami Ramananda &lt;br&gt;in &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Kashi.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Ranchoddasji Maharaj has samadhi in Pushkar, A trust in\n Rajkot, &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Gujarat and also in Chitakut too. At these places they do &lt;br&gt;&gt; charitable &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; activities.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Ranchoddasji Maharaj had many disciples but he never made anybody &lt;br&gt;&gt; his &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; sucessor.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; A lot of books have been written by one or two lady disciples of &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Ranchoddasji Maharaj and all this information written here is &lt;br&gt;&gt; coming &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; from those books. these books are avialable in his ashrams. They &lt;br&gt;&gt; are &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; written in Gujarati and Hindi Dialect.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; These books describe Ranchoddasji Maharaj&#39;s teachings, his view &lt;br&gt;on &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; many things, his short speeches and kind of like biography.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; These are very good books, they describe many aspects of &lt;br&gt;&gt; spirtuality &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; in simple laymans language.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Babaji indicated that Lahiri\n Mahashaya was his disciple for 5 &lt;br&gt;births&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; and in this birth with kriya yoga he cleared all his impressions &lt;br&gt;&gt; and &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; was given authority to guide people and initiate in kriya yoga &lt;br&gt;&gt; after &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; relalizing his true nature. Like him he had another disciple in &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Bengal too known as &quot;Din bandhu&quot; but I do not have any &lt;br&gt;information &lt;br&gt;&gt; on &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; him.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Babaji did meet Shri Yuteshwar Maharaj a few times.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; He also indicated that many advanced saints from the Nath &lt;br&gt;&gt; Sampradaya &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; also took birth and followed the ramanandi sampradaya to &lt;br&gt;experiance &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; more bliss.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; My intent here is to share information and not start any &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; controversies.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If anyone needs the names of these books and also the address of &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; ashrams, I am very happy to\n provide that too.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; If there is interest in more information than I shall try to &lt;br&gt;write &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; more about the lineage and the prominent saints of the lineage &lt;br&gt;too.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; I also have many pictures of Ranchoddasji Maharaj, but am not &lt;br&gt;sure &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; how to load them up for you all to see.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Happy Navratri&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Best Regards&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Mitesh&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt;&lt;br&gt;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;|| Om Shaantih Shaantih Shaantih ||&lt;br&gt;Yahoo!
