His\ndevotees in Tiruvannamalai, who=\r\n include men and women of many nationalities,\nheld to their master&#39;s own ph=\r\nilosophy as he was taken from them. They\nbelieve, like him, that there is n=\r\no death, but that Shri Ramana&#39;s physical\nform has ceased to function, while=\r\n his inner-being continues on an exalted\nplane.\n\nIt was his development of =\r\nthis theory that made the second son of an obscure\nvillage lawyer one of In=\r\ndia&#39;s most revered sages.\n\nShri Ramana had humble beginnings, and his schoo=\r\nl record was far from\nbrilliant. Neglecting his studies, he brooded on reli=\r\ngious subjects. One day\nin July, 1896, while reflecting on the mystery of d=\r\neath, the young\nVenkataraman, as his name was then, conceived the idea that=\r\n death of the\nbody is a relative thing and that the intellect belongs to a =\r\npower beyond\nwhich never dies.\n\nAfter a month of profound meditation on thi=\r\ns subject, he left home abruptly\nand repaired to the temple of his particul=\r\nar God, Arunachala, in\nTiruvannamalai. Here he shaved his head and adopted =\r\nthe robe of the Sanyasi\n(holy man). Soon he came to be regarded in the neig=\r\nhborhood as a queer one\nand he was jeered, stoned and eventually disowned b=\r\ny his family.\n\nTo escape persecution, the young ascetic took abode in a cav=\r\ne.

In later years, the\nl=\r\narge Ashram grew about the odd man, who made no effort to proselytize and\nc=\r\nontinued in silent meditation and writing. His followers changed his name\nt=\r\no Maharshi, which means great saint.\n\nHere in India, where thousands of so-=\r\ncalled holy men claim close ties with\nthe infinite, it is said that the mos=\r\nt remarkable thing about Shri Ramana\nMaharshi was that he never claimed any=\r\nthing remarkable for himself, yet\nbecame one most respected of all.\n\nSource=\r\n: http://www.arunachala.org/newsletters/2000/?pg=3Dmay-jun\n\nOriginal articl=\r\ne can be purchased from this newyorktimes website\n\nhttp://select.nytimes.co=\r\nm/gst/abstract.html?res=3DF10610F9345A11708DDDAF0994DC405B8089F1D3\n\n-- \n=E0=\r\n=B0=93=E0=B0=82  =E0=B0=A8=E0=B0=AE=E0=B1=8B  =E0=B0=AD=E0=B0=97=E0=B0=B5=\r\n=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=87  =E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=80  =E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B0=A3=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=AF\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=\r\n=BE=E0=B0=82=E0=B0=A4=E0=B1=8D  =E0=B0=9C=E0=B0=B2=E0=B0=B8=E0=B1=82=E0=B0=\r\n=A4=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B0=82\n=E0=B0=AA=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B0=E0=B1=87=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=87 =E0=B0=B6=E0=B0=BE=E0=B0=B6=E0=B1=8D=E0=B0=B5=E0=B0=A4=E0=B0=\r\n=AE=E0=B1=81\n\r\n--000e0cd1798efabcaf047e0d5c1b\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=UTF-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;color:rgb(51, 51, 51);font-family:Verdana&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=3D&quot;mar=\r\ngin-top:0px;margin-right:0px;margin-bottom:0.75em;margin-left:0px;line-heig=\r\nht:1.3em&quot;&gt;\n&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;The New York Times&lt;br&gt;Sunday, A=\r\npril 16, 1950&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:bold&quot;&gt;Religious Recl=\r\nuse Mourned in India;Shri Ramana Maharshi Was Called a &#39;Living Saint&#3=\r\n9; =E2=80=94 Made Abode in Cave&lt;/span&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;&lt;span style=3D&quot;font-weight:=\r\nbold&quot;&gt;NEW DELHI, India, April 15&lt;/span&gt;=C2=A0=E2=80=93 Hindu India mourned =\r\ntoday the death of one of her greatest &quot;living saints&quot; and a rema=\r\nrkable man of his time, Shri Ramana Maharshi, who died last night at the ag=\r\ne of 71 in his Ashram retreat at Tiruvannamalai near Pondicherry.&lt;br&gt;\n\n&lt;br&gt;=\r\nShri Ramana was renowned as a religious recluse and seer whose piety and ph=\r\nilosophy of self-abnegation gained him followers in many countries.
