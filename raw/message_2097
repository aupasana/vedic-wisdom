They work diff=\r\nerently, but\n&gt; both are valid.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; However, the problem with the former=\r\n is that most people cannot\n&gt; pronounce it correctly. The correct pronuncia=\r\ntion is to start saying\n&gt; &quot;hreeng&quot; and stop just when you are about to say =\r\n&quot;g&quot;. The sound &quot;g&quot;\n&gt; should not be explicit at all. To pronounce that nasal=\r\n &quot;n(g)&quot; correctly,\n&gt; you have to think that you are going to say &quot;ng&quot;, but =\r\nstop just short of\n&gt; &quot;g&quot;. It is not easy. Most people end up pronouncing th=\r\ne &quot;g&quot; sound a bit.\n&gt; Instead of making that mistake, it is better to just s=\r\ntick to &quot;hreem&quot;.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Bottomline: The forms hreem and hreen(g) with a si=\r\nlent g are both\n&gt; fine.
