It is human nature to=\r\n seek the rationality/reason/formula. somewhere we seek courage, confidence=\r\n, in this rationality. One has to transcend these rationality and stand fir=\r\nm in Sincere Devotion.\n\nI appreciate the line &quot;do homams for the love of ho=\r\nmams&quot; but while doing homam i could sense that it is a very powerful act/th=\r\ning/tool. \n\nstrotra, mantra, homam are spiritual tools and i can tell for s=\r\nure that these tools themselves have varying degree of power. The common an=\r\nd most important underlying thing being Sincere Devotion and identifying wi=\r\nth the all pervading atman.\n\n\nYou summed very nicely\n&quot;Summing it up, I comp=\r\nlain to Lordships if things donot go well, still I chant everyday as I love=\r\n them. Exalted devotees of Iskcon will not do it that way and may not crib =\r\nlike me, but the point is they are the Lords.&quot;\n\nA sincere spiritual devotio=\r\nnal attitude is i think must for any beginner. A personal relationship need=\r\ns to be cultivated. thanks for reminding me this.\n\nI am highly shaken and u=\r\nncertain in life right now, so i really appreciate all the wonderful points=\r\n you have shared.\n\nlove and regards\nPriyank\n\n\n\n\n\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoo=\r\ngroups.com, &quot;Rama V&quot; &lt;vsra_prasad@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; You did n&#39;t ask me, still=\r\n I will respond :-) In fact, I read this group at times, and sometimes I fe=\r\nlt like responding. Today, I am not in a great mood and let me show my disa=\r\ngreement :-)\n&gt; \n&gt;  Come out of Soumya, rudra (ugra) devata, etc. your perso=\r\nnal devata is your personal. You can get angry with him, love him, think he=\r\n has not done enough for you, and still love him. \n&gt; I am surprised these l=\r\nessons have come from someone who questioned his (once) guru, why one canno=\r\nt use rudraksha to pray Lord Vishnu and use tulasi beads to pray Lord Siva =\r\nand bhakti can go beyond those !\n&gt; \n&gt; All these dust will settle / ugra dev=\r\nata will punish but give faster results are just unacceptable, I wish there=\r\n is proof for those, unless we say pudding here :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s say, you hav=\r\ne to move back to India, would you consider it as &quot;my homam has worked and =\r\nI have been punished so that I can prosper spiritually&quot; or if you get to st=\r\nay back in US would you say &quot;my homam has worked and my devata has granted =\r\nme my wishes&quot; ! The answer you do not know. None of us even understand what=\r\n is right and what is wrong for us or for the world. You live with what you=\r\n think is right for you. \n&gt; \n&gt; Take it Steve Jobs way. Give your best shot =\r\nand if you lose, you can learn from the lessons :-)  He came to India, stay=\r\ned in Sh Neem Karoli Baba&#39;s (I guess I got the name right) ashram and went =\r\nback with thoughts that Einstein and Faraday have done more for humans ! He=\r\n went to do what he likes and is convinced with. The point is, what do you =\r\nlike ? If you love to do homam, just keep doing it and see what change it b=\r\nrings *in you*, not what changes it brings *to you*. \n&gt; \n&gt; People like me w=\r\nho questioned a lot took years just to understand Srila Prabhupada&#39;s words.=\r\n While someone like Sh Jananivasa Prabhu and Sh Bhakti Raghava Maharaj had =\r\nfaith in Lordships of Sh RadhaKrsna and SP and dedicated their lives to Krs=\r\nna bhakti. I was fortunate to meet the former, while I was unfortunate not =\r\nto have been initiated by the latter, you will find both of them Sh Manish =\r\nPandit&#39;s video on Lord Krsna. They are in the video for a reason for sure, =\r\nthey are exalted devotees. The difference between me and the exalted devote=\r\nes of Iskcon is, they are truly surrendered to Lord and I am waiting for th=\r\ne Lord to surrender to me and help me when needed ! Someday, when I learn, =\r\nI will crib less :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; One more example here, if it interests you. When =\r\nI went to Iskcon Santa clara, the temple was small. If I were maintaining t=\r\nhat temple, the first thing I would have mentioned is I have been doing so =\r\nmuch to build a bigger temple, but *one day there will be a bigger temple, =\r\nLord willing*. This is what Vaisesika Prabhu who heads the temple mentioned=\r\n &quot;We are all fortunate that their holy Lordships agreed to stay with us for=\r\n the last 7 years in this garage, let us do our best to give them a better =\r\nplace&quot;. Enough said. \n&gt; \n&gt; Do not get into what deities would do, they know=\r\n what to do. Whether they throw the rotten fruits first or not is not known=\r\n to us. While spreading of homam is totally amazing and appreciated, the st=\r\nuff like soumya devatas are slow and ugra devatas are fast is labeling them=\r\n without knowing them completely. At Iskcon, Lord Radha Krsna and Sh Narasi=\r\nmhadev are prayed on the same altar.\n&gt; \n&gt; Finally, it is not that you will =\r\nget spiritual, the kundalini will touch sahasrara and you are happily out !=\r\n Srila Prabhupada once told Harikesa maharaj &quot;Go to Russia and start preach=\r\ning and spread HareKrsna mahamantra&quot;. Harikesa maharaj mentioned &quot;They eat =\r\nmeat and do other sinful activities, what will happen to my Krsna conscious=\r\nness&quot;. SP said &quot;To hell with your Krsna consciousness, there are fallen sou=\r\nls who need delivery&quot;. Nicely put :-)\n&gt; \n&gt; Summing it up, I complain to Lor=\r\ndships if things donot go well, still I chant everyday as I love them. Exal=\r\nted devotees of Iskcon will not do it that way and may not crib like me, bu=\r\nt the point is they are the Lords.\n&gt; \n&gt; Anyways, I put this quickly, hope i=\r\nt makes sense. \n&gt; \n&gt; regards\n&gt; rAma\n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, =\r\n&quot;priyank_priyank&quot; &lt;aks_day@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; PVR\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Respected sir, I h=\r\nad sent your 3-4 mails last week at PVR regarding my situation as i am comp=\r\nletely shaken.

However, it is tough to prove=\r\n so.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; Secondly, it is also possible that some material setbacks=\r\n may be given \n&gt; &gt; &gt; by a deity to remove confusions from the mind and make=\r\n one realize what \n&gt; &gt; &gt; is permanent and what is impermanent. Sometimes, i=\r\nn order to overcome \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the tendency towards anxiety and depression, god=\r\n may push one into a \n&gt; &gt; &gt; terrible situation that aggravates one&#39;s anxiet=\r\ny, before clarity dawns \n&gt; &gt; &gt; on one.
