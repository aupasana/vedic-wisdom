If you do not know=\r\n the \nright deity, just doing some sadhana is definitely better than waitin=\r\ng. Pick \nwhatever deity seems natural to you and do sadhana.\n\nPlease rememb=\r\ner that sadhana for spiritual progress is different from \nsadhana for speci=\r\nfic material benefits. No matter which deity you worship, \nsadhana performe=\r\nd for spiritual progress never goes waste. However, \nsometimes it may be ne=\r\ncessary to experience the results of some bad karmas \nbefore some good thin=\r\ngs happen. Imagine all your karmas lying in a pile in a \nbasket. Suppose so=\r\nme of the really good karmas that will enable you to do \nserious sadhana an=\r\nd experience great things lie at the bottom or middle of \nthe pile. When yo=\r\nu start sadhana, suppose god decides to give you the fruits \nof those auspi=\r\ncious karmas. Imagine him reaching into the pile and \nretrieving those karm=\r\nas. In the process, some other karmas may spill over \nand give their fruits=\r\n. Some of those may be undesirable. So what? They had \nto be experienced so=\r\nmetime or the other, anyway!\n\nA serious sadhaka should never be disheartene=\r\nd by a few seemingly \nundesirable results after starting a spiritual sadhan=\r\na. Just keep going.\n\nOne gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali from a =\r\nvery good \npriest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra for a few =\r\ndays, he was \nlaid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed. He continued=\r\n his sadhana \nand used the break to go on an extended trip to India and mak=\r\ne a pilgrimage \nto some nice places. He participated in the Shata Chandi ho=\r\nmam we conducted \nat the Kaalikambal temple in Chennai in March 2006. He me=\r\nt my guru and got \nthe opportunity to be his room mate for a week when we s=\r\ntayed at the house \nof a priest during the homam. He could observe and inte=\r\nract with my guru \nvery closely. Most importantly, when my guru had a visio=\r\nn of the Mother on \n2006 March 3 afternoon, in which She told him to start =\r\nthe work on spreading \nhomam in the world, this gentleman was present there=\r\n. Though he could not \nsee the Mother, he actually smelled something out of=\r\n the world and was \nbaffled. He knew something was going on, but did not kn=\r\now what. The temple \nwas closed at the time and my guru and this gentlemen =\r\nwere the only people \non the premises when the Mother appeared. Even though=\r\n he could not see the \nMother, it was most fortunate of him to be present t=\r\nhere at *that* crucial \nmoment. That is enough to mould the rest of his lif=\r\ne.\n\nYou never know how, when and where the grace of god falls on you. \nCalc=\r\nulations and logic are useless when it comes to the grace of god. Just \nsur=\r\nrender and keep doing whatever sadhana you picked. If it needs \nfine-tuning=\r\n, somebody will appear to tell you that. Any bad things that \nhappen when d=\r\noing a spiritual sadhana should be viewed as nature settling \nsome debts so=\r\n that you are prepared to receive the fruits of some really \nauspicious kar=\r\nmas.\n\nAs Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have &quot;sraddha and saburi&quot;. Have d=\r\nevotion \nand patience. There is no limit to what you can get then.\n\nBest re=\r\ngards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- -\nDo a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam\nDo=\r\n Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\nSpiritua=\r\nlity: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\nFree Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net\nFree Jyotish software (Windows): =\r\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nSri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://=\r\nwww.SriJagan nath.org\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- =\r\n--------- - \n\n----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; Namaste Sir\n&gt; what you said m=\r\nakes a lot sense and it was marvellous\n&gt; but i have some small doubts\n&gt;\n&gt; L=\r\neaving astrology aside and those who do not have a guru\n&gt; how can they choo=\r\nose a particular form of GOD\n&gt; bcoz in second part of AGHORA, Vimalanda, sa=\r\nid choosing right deity\n&gt; is very important, as the analogy he gave of a pe=\r\nrson\n&gt; who is greedy and worships LAKSHMI , may increase his greed\n&gt;\n&gt; One =\r\nthing more\n&gt; we have so many deities that on diwali i would like to worship=\r\n\n&gt; Lakshmi and Kali\n&gt; in navaratri (nowadays) we would worship Durga\n&gt; on j=\r\nanmashtami we would fast for KRISHNA\n&gt; an on MAHASHIVARATRI for SHIVA\n&gt; lik=\r\ne this\n&gt; with hte change in festival the deity changes\n&gt;\n&gt; though everybody=\r\n knows GOD is ONE but it becomes difficult to get\n&gt; out of this\n&gt; mould and=\r\n if i didnt worship her may be that GOD/GODDESS may become\n&gt; angry\n&gt;\n&gt; I Kn=\r\now,this is my foolishness but stiil this thing hangs in the mind\n&gt;\n&gt; One th=\r\ning more\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose if i choose a deity and something wrong happens\n&gt; (mat=\r\neriallistically )\n&gt;\n&gt; what should i consider that my deity was helping me t=\r\no clear my\n&gt; DEBTS/WRONG DEEDS\n&gt; or the NATURE was telling me to change the=\r\n DEITY as I am not fit\n&gt; for that DEITY\n&gt;\n&gt; and sometimes you feel\n&gt; o what=\r\n am i doing does this really works\n&gt;\n&gt; and one thing more\n&gt;\n&gt; what if we go=\r\n on doing our pooja and someday\n&gt; something like what happened to Pt.

I will\n=\r\n&gt; continue in\n&gt;&gt; the same vein for a little more time.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I had a dream =\r\na couple of years ago early in the morning. In the\n&gt; dream,\n&gt;&gt; there was a =\r\nbig ritual fire. My guru Manish Pandit and I were\n&gt; sitting in\n&gt;&gt; front of =\r\nthe fire. He was teaching me some pranayama techniques in\n&gt; the\n&gt;&gt; dream. S=\r\nuddenly, he changed into somebody else that I could not\n&gt; recognize.\n&gt;&gt; It =\r\nwas not anybody I had seen before.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I mentioned this dream to my guru =\r\nafter a couple of weeks. First\n&gt; he said he\n&gt;&gt; did not know who the other p=\r\nerson was and said he would&#39;ve\n&gt; probably known if\n&gt;&gt; I had mentioned the d=\r\nream soon after it had happened. I left it\n&gt; there.\n&gt;&gt; However, when we tal=\r\nked in the next weekend, he referred to my\n&gt; dream and\n&gt;&gt; said he had an id=\r\nea who it was. He gave me a name and asked me to\n&gt; search on\n&gt;&gt; the interne=\r\nt for his photo and see if he was the person I saw in\n&gt; my dream.\n&gt;&gt; It was=\r\n a guru from the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda (before\n&gt; him). Though\n&gt;&gt;=\r\n he is apparently well-known, I was not knowledegable about this\n&gt; lineage =\r\nand\n&gt;&gt; did not see his picture before. I searched on the internet and\n&gt; fou=\r\nnd a\n&gt;&gt; photo. Interestingly, the photo was very close to the person I saw\n=\r\n&gt; in my\n&gt;&gt; dream. The person that Manish transformed into in my dream looke=\r\nd\n&gt; like a\n&gt;&gt; slightly younger version of that photo.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; When I confirme=\r\nd this to Manish, he only smiled and\n&gt; said, &quot;Narasimha, there\n&gt;&gt; are so ma=\r\nny links between various lineages. Leave it for now.&quot;\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Of course, I do=\r\n not know much about kriya yoga or about the\n&gt; lineage of\n&gt;&gt; Paramahamsa Yo=\r\ngananda. Our lineage of this life starts from\n&gt; Dattatreya. We\n&gt;&gt; have a sp=\r\necial attachment to Ramakrishna Paramahamsa and his\n&gt; lineage and got\n&gt;&gt; a =\r\nlot of our knowledge, inspiration and perhaps experience from\n&gt; them. We do=\r\n\n&gt;&gt; not have any direct link to the lineage of Paramahamsa Yogananda.\n&gt; But=\r\n,\n&gt;&gt; Manish thought there were some other indirect links. Moreover, he\n&gt; gu=\r\nessed\n&gt;&gt; who I saw, even though I myself had no idea who I saw, and he\n&gt; gu=\r\nessed\n&gt;&gt; correctly. That should count for something!\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I will not be su=\r\nrprised if there are indeed subtle connections\n&gt; between\n&gt;&gt; several lineage=\r\ns that seem disjoint today.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; By the way, Swami Vivekananda also appear=\r\ned in the prison cell of\n&gt; Sri\n&gt;&gt; Aurobindo (who wrote brilliant commentari=\r\nes on Veda and Upanishad)\n&gt; and\n&gt;&gt; imparted him some Adwaita knowledge to S=\r\nri Aurobindo.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; An interesting coincidence is that a swamij=\r\ni from Puri contacted\n&gt; me within a\n&gt;&gt; few days after I saw that photo. His=\r\n guru and Paramahamsa\n&gt; Yogananda were\n&gt;&gt; co-disciples of the same guru (Yu=\r\nkteshwar Maharaj). He is the\n&gt; keeper of\n&gt;&gt; some astrological knowledge tha=\r\nt his guru received from Yukteshwar\n&gt; Maharaj.\n&gt;&gt; He visited me after a mon=\r\nth, discussed that knowledge and spent a\n&gt; day at my\n&gt;&gt; house. Thus, some s=\r\nmall connection was made with a representative\n&gt; of that\n&gt;&gt; lineage soon af=\r\nter the dream. After all, some karmik debts may\n&gt; have been\n&gt;&gt; there...\n&gt;&gt;\n=\r\n&gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; I want to make one thing clear.\n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Some things I mention =\r\nlike this may give the impression that my\n&gt; guru has\n&gt;&gt; some psychic abilit=\r\nies or siddhis. That may indeed be true. But he\n&gt; always\n&gt;&gt; downplays those=\r\n things and attaches no importance whatsoever. He\n&gt; says,\n&gt;&gt; &quot;Narasimha, I =\r\nam a useless person and lower than dirt and capable\n&gt; of\n&gt;&gt; nothing. It is =\r\nall Her power. She is the connection between every\n&gt; entity in\n&gt;&gt; this univ=\r\nerse. She may choose an idiot like me as an instrument\n&gt; sometimes\n&gt;&gt; and d=\r\no something using me.

If you do not know the &lt;BR&gt;right deity, just doing some sadhana is defi=\r\nnitely better than waiting. Pick &lt;BR&gt;whatever deity seems natural to you an=\r\nd do sadhana.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Please remember that sadhana for spiritual progress is=\r\n different from &lt;BR&gt;sadhana for specific material benefits. No matter which=\r\n deity you worship, &lt;BR&gt;sadhana performed for spiritual progress never goes=\r\n waste. However, &lt;BR&gt;sometimes it may be necessary to experience the result=\r\ns of some bad karmas &lt;BR&gt;before some good things happen. Imagine all your k=\r\narmas lying in a pile in a &lt;BR&gt;basket. Suppose some of the really good karm=\r\nas that will enable you to do &lt;BR&gt;serious sadhana and experience great thin=\r\ngs lie at the bottom or middle of &lt;BR&gt;the pile. When you start sadhana, sup=\r\npose god decides to give you the fruits &lt;BR&gt;of those auspicious karmas. Ima=\r\ngine him reaching into the pile and &lt;BR&gt;retrieving those karmas. In the\n pr=\r\nocess, some other karmas may spill over &lt;BR&gt;and give their fruits. Some of =\r\nthose may be undesirable. So what? They had &lt;BR&gt;to be experienced sometime =\r\nor the other, anyway!&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;A serious sadhaka should never be disheartened=\r\n by a few seemingly &lt;BR&gt;undesirable results after starting a spiritual sadh=\r\nana. Just keep going.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One gentleman I know received mantra for Kaali=\r\n from a very good &lt;BR&gt;priest-cum-yogi in late 2005. After he did the mantra=\r\n for a few days, he was &lt;BR&gt;laid off and lost his job. He was not perturbed=\r\n. He continued his sadhana &lt;BR&gt;and used the break to go on an extended trip=\r\n to India and make a pilgrimage &lt;BR&gt;to some nice places. He participated in=\r\n the Shata Chandi homam we conducted &lt;BR&gt;at the Kaalikambal temple in Chenn=\r\nai in March 2006. He met my guru and got &lt;BR&gt;the opportunity to be his room=\r\n mate for a week when we stayed at the house &lt;BR&gt;of a priest during the hom=\r\nam. He could observe and interact with my guru &lt;BR&gt;very closely.\n Most impo=\r\nrtantly, when my guru had a vision of the Mother on &lt;BR&gt;2006 March 3 aftern=\r\noon, in which She told him to start the work on spreading &lt;BR&gt;homam in the =\r\nworld, this gentleman was present there. Though he could not &lt;BR&gt;see the Mo=\r\nther, he actually smelled something out of the world and was &lt;BR&gt;baffled. H=\r\ne knew something was going on, but did not know what. The temple &lt;BR&gt;was cl=\r\nosed at the time and my guru and this gentlemen were the only people &lt;BR&gt;on=\r\n the premises when the Mother appeared. Even though he could not see the &lt;B=\r\nR&gt;Mother, it was most fortunate of him to be present there at *that* crucia=\r\nl &lt;BR&gt;moment. That is enough to mould the rest of his life.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You neve=\r\nr know how, when and where the grace of god falls on you. &lt;BR&gt;Calculations =\r\nand logic are useless when it comes to the grace of god. Just &lt;BR&gt;surrender=\r\n and keep doing whatever sadhana you picked. If it needs &lt;BR&gt;fine-tuning, s=\r\nomebody will appear to tell you that. Any bad things that\n &lt;BR&gt;happen when =\r\ndoing a spiritual sadhana should be viewed as nature settling &lt;BR&gt;some debt=\r\ns so that you are prepared to receive the fruits of some really &lt;BR&gt;auspici=\r\nous karmas.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;As Shirdi Sai Baba says, you should have &quot;sraddha and sa=\r\nburi&quot;. Have devotion &lt;BR&gt;and patience. There is no limit to what you can ge=\r\nt then.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best regards,&lt;BR&gt;Narasimha&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- -------=\r\n-- --------- --------- --------- -&lt;BR&gt;Do a Short Homam Yourself: &lt;A href=3D=\r\n&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;http:=\r\n//www.VedicAst rologer.org/ homam&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: &lt;A hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow=\r\n&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Spirituality: &lt;A href=3D&quot;h=\r\nttp://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D_blank rel=3Dnofollow&gt;h=\r\nttp://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (M=\r\nP3): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D_blank\n rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://vedicastro. home.comcast. net&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Free Jyotish softwa=\r\nre (Windows): &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D_blank r=\r\nel=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.VedicAst rologer.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (=\r\nSJC) website: &lt;A href=3D&quot;http://www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D_blank rel=\r\n=3Dnofollow&gt;http://www.SriJagan nath.org&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;------------ --------- ----=\r\n----- --------- --------- --------- - &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;----- Original Message ----- =\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namaste Sir&lt;BR&gt;&gt; what you said makes a lot sense and it was mar=\r\nvellous&lt;BR&gt;&gt; but i have some small doubts&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Leaving astrol=\r\nogy aside and those who do not have a guru&lt;BR&gt;&gt; how can they chooose a p=\r\narticular form of GOD&lt;BR&gt;&gt; bcoz in second part of AGHORA, Vimalanda, sai=\r\nd choosing right deity&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is very important, as the analogy he gave of=\r\n a person&lt;BR&gt;&gt; who is greedy and worships LAKSHMI , may increase his gre=\r\ned&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One thing more&lt;BR&gt;&gt; we have so many deities that on\n =\r\ndiwali i would like to worship&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Lakshmi and Kali&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in navaratr=\r\ni (nowadays) we would worship Durga&lt;BR&gt;&gt; on janmashtami we would fast fo=\r\nr KRISHNA&lt;BR&gt;&gt; an on MAHASHIVARATRI for SHIVA&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nwith hte change in festival the deity changes&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; though everyb=\r\nody knows GOD is ONE but it becomes difficult to get&lt;BR&gt;&gt; out of this&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt; mould and if i didnt worship her may be that GOD/GODDESS may become&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; angry&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I Know,this is my foolishness but stiil this t=\r\nhing hangs in the mind&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; One thing more&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Suppo=\r\nse if i choose a deity and something wrong happens&lt;BR&gt;&gt; (materiallistica=\r\nlly )&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; what should i consider that my deity was helping me t=\r\no clear my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; DEBTS/WRONG DEEDS&lt;BR&gt;&gt; or the NATURE was telling me t=\r\no change the DEITY as I am not fit&lt;BR&gt;&gt; for that DEITY&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; a=\r\nnd sometimes you feel&lt;BR&gt;&gt; o what am i doing does this really\n works&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; and one thing more&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; what if we go on doing our =\r\npooja and someday&lt;BR&gt;&gt; something like what happened to Pt.

I will&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; continue in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the same vein for a little more time.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I had a dream a couple of years ago early in the morning. In =\r\nthe&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dream,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; there was a big ritual fire. My guru Manish =\r\nPandit and I were&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sitting in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; front of the fire. He was =\r\nteaching me some pranayama techniques in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; the&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; dream. Sud=\r\ndenly, he changed into somebody else that I could not&lt;BR&gt;&gt; recognize.&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; It was not anybody I had seen\n before.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I =\r\nmentioned this dream to my guru after a couple of weeks. First&lt;BR&gt;&gt; he s=\r\naid he&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; did not know who the other person was and said he would&#39;=\r\nve&lt;BR&gt;&gt; probably known if&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I had mentioned the dream soon aft=\r\ner it had happened. I left it&lt;BR&gt;&gt; there.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; However, when we t=\r\nalked in the next weekend, he referred to my&lt;BR&gt;&gt; dream and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; =\r\nsaid he had an idea who it was. He gave me a name and asked me to&lt;BR&gt;&gt; s=\r\nearch on&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; the internet for his photo and see if he was the perso=\r\nn I saw in&lt;BR&gt;&gt; my dream.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; It was a guru from the lineage of =\r\nParamahamsa Yogananda (before&lt;BR&gt;&gt; him). Though&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; he is appare=\r\nntly well-known, I was not knowledegable about this&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lineage and&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; did not see his picture before. I searched on the internet and&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; found a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; photo. Interestingly, the photo was very close to =\r\nthe person I saw&lt;BR&gt;&gt; in\n my&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; dream. The person that Manish t=\r\nransformed into in my dream looked&lt;BR&gt;&gt; like a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; slightly youn=\r\nger version of that photo.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; When I confirmed this to=\r\n Manish, he only smiled and&lt;BR&gt;&gt; said, &quot;Narasimha, there&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; are=\r\n so many links between various lineages. Leave it for now.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt;&gt; Of course, I do not know much about kriya yoga or about the&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; lineage of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Paramahamsa Yogananda. Our lineage of this life st=\r\narts from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Dattatreya. We&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; have a special attachment to R=\r\namakrishna Paramahamsa and his&lt;BR&gt;&gt; lineage and got&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; a lot of=\r\n our knowledge, inspiration and perhaps experience from&lt;BR&gt;&gt; them. We do=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; not have any direct link to the lineage of Paramahamsa Yoganan=\r\nda.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; But,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; Manish thought there were some other indirect =\r\nlinks. Moreover, he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; guessed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; who I saw, even though I my=\r\nself had no idea who\n I saw, and he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; guessed&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; correctly. =\r\nThat should count for something!&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I will not be surp=\r\nrised if there are indeed subtle connections&lt;BR&gt;&gt; between&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; se=\r\nveral lineages that seem disjoint today.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; By the way=\r\n, Swami Vivekananda also appeared in the prison cell of&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Sri&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n&gt; Aurobindo (who wrote brilliant commentaries on Veda and Upanishad)&lt;BR&gt;=\r\n&gt; and&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; imparted him some Adwaita knowledge to Sri Aurobindo.&lt;=\r\nBR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; An interesting coinci=\r\ndence is that a swamiji from Puri contacted&lt;BR&gt;&gt; me within a&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;=\r\n few days after I saw that photo. His guru and Paramahamsa&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Yoganand=\r\na were&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; co-disciples of the same guru (Yukteshwar Maharaj). He i=\r\ns the&lt;BR&gt;&gt; keeper of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; some astrological knowledge that his gu=\r\nru received from Yukteshwar&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Maharaj.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; He visited me afte=\r\nr a month,\n discussed that knowledge and spent a&lt;BR&gt;&gt; day at my&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&=\r\ngt; house. Thus, some small connection was made with a representative&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; of that&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; lineage soon after the dream. After all, some karmik=\r\n debts may&lt;BR&gt;&gt; have been&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; there...&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; *=\r\n * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I want to make one thing clear.&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR=\r\n&gt;&gt;&gt; Some things I mention like this may give the impression that my&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; guru has&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; some psychic abilities or siddhis. That may ind=\r\need be true. But he&lt;BR&gt;&gt; always&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; downplays those things and a=\r\nttaches no importance whatsoever. He&lt;BR&gt;&gt; says,&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; &quot;Narasimha, =\r\nI am a useless person and lower than dirt and capable&lt;BR&gt;&gt; of&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt=\r\n; nothing. It is all Her power. She is the connection between every&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n entity in&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; this universe. She may choose an idiot like me as an=\r\n instrument&lt;BR&gt;&gt; sometimes&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; and do something using me. I have=\r\n no\n special abilities of any&lt;BR&gt;&gt; kind. Any&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; coincidences yo=\r\nu find are just Her grace and not due to me.&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; I rea=\r\nlized in time that this simplicity, humility and lack of ego&lt;BR&gt;&gt; is not=\r\n&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&gt; fake.
