Mine follows.\n=C2=A0\n&quot;Mugging up of vedas&quot; - mugging of ve=\r\ndas is not like mugging up an engineering text book for the exam. It is a s=\r\nadhana in itself. upto 12-13 hours=C2=A0aday of mantra chanting for 4 to 5 =\r\nyears coupled with one&#39;s nitya karma like sandhya vandanam, brahma yajnam, =\r\nsamidadhanam (the homa performed in the morning and evening by the student)=\r\n. It involves santha, anusantha and avrutis. The sadhana continues until br=\r\nahma (mantra) becomes his power (varchas) and thereafter for the rest of th=\r\ne life time. I have come across a scholar whose fingers keep moving even in=\r\n sleep in accordance with the rythm of the mantra. He has transformed himse=\r\nlf into the mantra. The veda is installed inside him. This is no less than =\r\nany sadhana we are speaking about.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nYou see, the reason=\r\n why I mentioned this is again because of a documentary film that was made =\r\nby Sri Staal regarding the Agnicayana he (and his team) had sponsered in Ke=\r\nrala. He showed some &quot;vedic&quot; priests who chant various mantra from the Veda=\r\ns for hours everyday for almost all their lives. When he asked them some pe=\r\nrtinent queries about what these mantras might mean etc, the priests simply=\r\n shook their head and came up with a very tame reply that this is how they =\r\nhave been taught to do things. No wonder Sri Staal came up with the fancy=\r\n=C2=A0birds and bees theory from such inputs. \n=C2=A0\nI agree that chanting=\r\n of the Vedas for hours on end is surely a sadhana. For that matter, any fo=\r\ncused attention given to any work becomes a sadhana in it&#39;s own rights. But=\r\n my point is, to understand the real import of the Vedas, one must do sadha=\r\nna for spiritual realization and then and only then can one really claim to=\r\n say what is truely Vedic and what is not. Sadhana for God realization is t=\r\nhe path, and when the realization dawns in sufficient degrees, one maybe ab=\r\nle to get a really clear perspective of what exactly the Vedas talk about. =\r\nNot with energy flowing through Ida nadi, nor with energy flowing through p=\r\ningla nadi can one understand what the Vedas truely are. But with energy fl=\r\nowing through the susumna nadi, there is hope! That is experiential and a r=\r\nesult of sadhana aimed at realizing the Self.\n=C2=A0\nFor this transformed b=\r\neing learning bhashya is not necessary. He knows even beforehand what is th=\r\nere in the bhashya and what it means in various planes.\n=C2=A0\nMy view is t=\r\nhat, Vedas are absolute uncorruptable knowledge, and therefore before the a=\r\nbove transformation happens, ones understanding of the Vedas and what=C2=A0=\r\nreally constitues the ambit of Vedic knowledge will be questionable, if not=\r\n outright incorrect. Hence, I see no value in statements like such and such=\r\n ritual is what Vedas is all about and such and such is not. Most people wh=\r\no make such statements are nowhere close to any states of realization. Mere=\r\n intellectual assessements are not really of much value.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nIf w=\r\ne call Sayana&#39;s commentary a distortion, we will have to disown Yaska as we=\r\nll.\n=C2=A0\nWell, if you like Sayanacharya&#39; s commentaries, so be it. I do n=\r\not consider it sacroscant. So we have to=C2=A0just respectfully disagree wi=\r\nth each other:). Hope that is fine with you. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\n2. &quot;Vasistha sp=\r\noke the Yoga Vasistham&quot;\n=C2=A0\nWho is the real author of yoga vasishtam Vas=\r\nishta or Valmiki ?\n=C2=A0\nValmiki notes what Vasistha speaks to Rama.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\n3. &quot;The vedic rishis were famous for doing elaborate yagyas and homas. =\r\nBy extension of your above logic, it means they did not believe in Advaita =\r\nsince they used to engage themselves in homas and yagyas?&quot;\n=C2=A0\nAdvaita (=\r\n or for that matter vedanta) is only one of the six darsanas (or ways of lo=\r\noking at it). Dvaita, Vishitadvaita and Meemamsa have different views. \n=C2=\r\n=A0\nTrue. Yes there were have been philosophical fights, but that was mostl=\r\ny in the Upanishadic and Pouranik periods and not really in the=C2=A0 origi=\r\nnal Vedic period. Infact, people (indologists)=C2=A0are not even sure of wh=\r\nat constitues the real Vedic age, so getting an accurate description is a f=\r\nar cry. \n=C2=A0\nSri Ramakrishna and most of his disciples - who were all se=\r\nlf-realized saints - would often comment that from the perspective of a sad=\r\nhaka of God, these philosophies were never ment to be in contradiction to o=\r\nne another but supplementary to each other. They explained in many of their=\r\n writings how each of them (philosophies)=C2=A0had a place and a stage and =\r\nhow each were essentially supportive of the different stages and paths lead=\r\ning one to the=C2=A0realization of the absolute non-differentiated Brahman.=\r\n I find this explanation more appealing and realistic.\n=C2=A0\nI was talking=\r\n about the ones who composed the Veda mantras. They were all knowing, and a=\r\nll knowledgebale seers. The Upanishats and various emanating philosophies w=\r\nithin the ambit of our Sanatana Dharma, all undeniably=C2=A0trace their roo=\r\nts to the Vedas. That means, the satha darshanas are not outside of the rea=\r\nlm of the core Vedas. Therefore, the ones who composed the vedic hymns were=\r\n both jyanis, vigyanis as well as performers of elaborate fire rituals, all=\r\n combined together. There is no conflict here. \n=C2=A0\nJust like Vasistha s=\r\nays in the Yoga Vasistham, God realization is a bird with two wings -right =\r\naction with the right knowledge. Either of the wings not functioning, makes=\r\n the bird come crashing down. \n=C2=A0\n\n4. &quot;Can you kindly enlighten us, why=\r\n is Usha accorded an elevated status&quot;.\n=C2=A0\nNo surpirse, That is the esse=\r\nnce of veda.

If this=\r\n is the essence of the Vedas, can you explain in a logical coherent manner,=\r\n how exactly does these simple natural phenomenons lead to the elevated Upa=\r\nnishatic philosophies, when every school of thought inside Hinduism traced =\r\nits roots to the core Vedas? How does one explain this so called=C2=A0jump =\r\nwithout taking an allegorical view of the Vedic hymns? \n=C2=A0\n5. &quot;The way =\r\none can learn is different based on the different models of the aeroplanes =\r\nin which one learns to fly!&quot;\n=C2=A0\nIf one has flying experience on a cessa=\r\nna alone he will not be allowed to fly a boeing. This is why I said I am on=\r\nly against mixing up.\n=C2=A0\nOne who has learnt flying a cessana can very w=\r\nell learn to fly a boeing if he so wishes. It can remove his inhibitions ab=\r\nout flying and in future, if God will, can learn others as well. What harm =\r\ntherefore in learning to fly, with any model what so ever? None absolutely.=\r\n\n=C2=A0\n6. &quot;No. Many self-realized people have &#39;mixed&#39; these artifically cr=\r\neated boundaried and achived and experienced higher states.

For each succesful one t=\r\nhere may be many who have also failed miserably.\n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0I consider th=\r\nis to be an unfounded fear. Real sadhana for God realization often does not=\r\n follow such aritificial boundaries. Realization God is never a matter of l=\r\nuck, but a product of intense sadhana and patience. And doing a daily homam=\r\n of any deity is a=C2=A0furiously beautiful sadhana.

Never! &quot;\n=C2=A0\n&quot;Mugging up of vedas&quot; - mugging of veda=\r\ns is not like mugging up an engineering text book for the exam. It is a sad=\r\nhana in itself. upto 12-13 hours=C2=A0aday of mantra chanting for 4 to 5 ye=\r\nars coupled with one&#39;s nitya karma like sandhya vandanam, brahma yajnam, sa=\r\nmidadhanam (the homa performed in the morning and evening by the student). =\r\nIt involves santha, anusantha and avrutis. The sadhana continues until brah=\r\nma (mantra) becomes his power (varchas) and thereafter for the rest of the =\r\nlife time. I have come across a scholar whose fingers keep moving even in s=\r\nleep in accordance with the rythm of the mantra. He has transformed himself=\r\n into the mantra. The veda is installed inside him. This is no less than an=\r\ny sadhana we are speaking about.\n=C2=A0\nFor this transformed being learning=\r\n bhashya is not necessary. He knows even beforehand what is there in the bh=\r\nashya and what it means in various planes.\n=C2=A0\nFor information, Sayana&#39;s=\r\n commentaries are based on the nirukta (meaning of vedic terms) of Yaska. N=\r\nirukta is one of the vedangas.

It is called panihomam. Even the fire is not=\r\n present there.

Does such a non-realized being have &quot;fire&quot; in his right hand? Never!=\r\n \n=C2=A0\nA real &quot;srotriya&quot; is one who has realized the Aatman, not in words=\r\n, but in the states of samadhi. Such a being &quot;may have&quot; spiritual abilities=\r\n of fire in his &quot;palm&quot;. Anyone else, irrespective of whether he is=C2=A0bor=\r\nn in=C2=A0brhamin family, is merely following a blind tradition without hav=\r\ning experienced anything and thus violating the essence of the Vedas and me=\r\nrely sticking to external rules which have no spiritual consequence. What u=\r\nse is such=C2=A0a=C2=A0&#39;vedic&#39; rituals, if at all they can be called as ved=\r\nic. That which is devoide of the essence, is an empty shell which is bound =\r\nto reform or perish in the course of time. \n=C2=A0\nTherefore, for me, it ha=\r\nrdly matters if the ritual is done on the bare palms or a gloved hands of a=\r\n person who has never experienced the Self. Both, are in clear violation of=\r\n the Vedic essence.\n=C2=A0\nHomam is a ritualistic form of worship and if yo=\r\nu bring in advaita vada in it it doesn&#39;t work.\n=C2=A0\nThis is definitely in=\r\ncorrect!

As=\r\n long as one is trapped in duality, merely saying that I believe in Advaith=\r\na Vada does not make one become so. I can keep believing that I am Bill Gat=\r\nes, but that=C2=A0won&#39;t make me Bill Gates. Rather=C2=A0I shall remain mere=\r\nly as a self deluded entity. Untill one actually experiences the state of n=\r\non-duality, theoritical talk of &quot;All- is Brahman&quot; is self-delusion. \n=C2=A0=\r\n\nAdwaith is a state to be achieve. It needs sustained and serious sadhana. =\r\nNo wonder the Rishis of yore, who were all self-realized beings - and had e=\r\nxperienced the state of=C2=A0Advaitha - used to perform such long penances,=\r\n including elaborate fire rituals on a daily basis. \n=C2=A0\n=C2=A0\nIt is no=\r\nt a question of whether it is more elaborate or less elaborate or which is =\r\ninferior or which is superior. It is a question of whether it is correct an=\r\nd based on what vedic authority.\n=C2=A0\nThe question is not about being bas=\r\ned on &quot;which vedic authority&quot; BUT, is the sadhana bearing fruits? Is it tra=\r\nnsforming the individual? Irrespective of which vedic &#39;authority&#39; says what=\r\n, if a said sadhana is not leading to experiantial knowledge and states, it=\r\n is useless for a genuine sadhaka. Therefore, the only way to judge is to p=\r\nerform the sadhana and experience for oneself! And this is why there are so=\r\n many who are already doing the homas on a daily basis. Some have experienc=\r\ned paritally, some are yet to. And each experience merely rivets one&#39;s mind=\r\n to the sadhana more and more thus plunging in deeper and deeper. A sadhaka=\r\n has little use for dry theory. That which cannot be experienced, is of no =\r\nconsequence. It is this perspective that any sadhana, not just the ones men=\r\ntioned by Narasimha, has to be judged by a genuine sadhaka. \n=C2=A0\n\n2. &quot;Wh=\r\nat I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know any.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nAre ther=\r\ne different ways you teach a person to fly an aeroplane depending on what h=\r\ne knows and what he does ?\n=C2=A0\nThe flying of the aeroplane is the same. =\r\nThe way one can learn is different based on the different models of the aer=\r\noplanes in which one learns to fly!\n=C2=A0\n3. &quot;Knowledge of *external ritua=\r\nls* is relative and can never be absolute.

I am eternally grateful to him&quot;\n=C2=A0\nand now you=\r\n say\n=C2=A0\n&quot;In my well-considered view, Sanjay ji got some specific secret=\r\ns and some generic guidelines (which may be imperfect, like with all other =\r\nparamparas) from his elders. He then read some books and formed his underst=\r\nanding. As he started teaching it, he received a lot of adulation for the &quot;=\r\nparampara secrets&quot;. I am afraid he got addicted to the adulation and starte=\r\nd to manufacture &quot;parampara secrets&quot; after the initial run. Slowly he becam=\r\ne commercial and he started selling manufactured &quot;parampara knowledge&quot;.\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nYes, his teachings contain fascinating philosophization, which is reall=\r\ny superficial and does not stand any real scrutiny. His theories are like b=\r\neautiful structures built with a pack of cards. Sanjay ji always maintains =\r\nan air of &quot;I know more, but will teach later&quot;. It is convenient to give the=\r\n impression that there is more. If anything does not make sense, it could b=\r\ne because you have to learn more!\n=C2=A0\nAs he started exploiting and comme=\r\nrcializing half-baked and ill-conceived knowledge in the name of a parampar=\r\na, I took an exception to the commercialization and dishonesty.

If there is anything in his teachings that can be =\r\nused relatively reliably, it is TP.&quot;\n=C2=A0\nIn 2000 you said\n=C2=A0\n\n&quot;Naray=\r\nana dasa is a very important rasi dasa. It is a phalita dasa. It shows gene=\r\nral\n\n\n\n\n\nresults. Narayana dasa is computed differently for different divis=\r\nional charts and we \ncan use Narayana dasa of a divisional chart to predict=\r\n matters related to that \ndivisional chart. \n=C2=A0 \nNarayana dasa is based=\r\n on the progression of lagna in one=E2=80=99s life. As one dasa ends \nand a=\r\nnother starts, one rasi stops being the progressed lagna and another rasi \n=\r\nbecomes one=E2=80=99s progressed lagna. Using the progressed lagna as the r=\r\neference, we \nfind out the events that happen in that dasa. Thus we get twe=\r\nlve charts for each \nperson, with each chart applicable in one dasa. \n=C2=\r\n=A0 \nThis is a very versatile dasa system and readers sould pay attention t=\r\no the details of \ncalculation. &quot;\n=C2=A0\nnow you say\n=C2=A0\n&quot;Narayana dasa m=\r\nay be based on some genuine parampara knowledge, but it does not work with =\r\nany level of consistency.

I do not care exactly what procedure one uses and I will be =\r\nhappy if more and more people do homam *regularly*, irrespective of the exa=\r\nct procedure used! What I teach is ONE procedure for those who do not know =\r\nany. If you are initiated into a different procedure that you can do daily,=\r\n please go ahead and do it daily the way you know it.

Suppose the protocol is so complex that one cannot do it everyday and=\r\n calls one&#39;s parents for a lunch once every few months.\n\nIs that better or =\r\nis it better to relax the rules and protocols to make it less formal and se=\r\nrve lunch to parents everyday?\n\n* * *\n\n&gt; 21. I suggest that we preserve eac=\r\nh branch of knowledge in its own purity.\n&gt; Hybrids may not always yield goo=\r\nd results. Let almighty help to preserve\n&gt; knowledge uncorrupted.\n\nThe only=\r\n knowledge that should (and can) be preserved without corruption is knowled=\r\nge that is *absolute*. Veda, or the knowledge of imperishable Self, alone i=\r\ns absolute knowledge.\n\nKnowledge of *external rituals* is relative and can =\r\nnever be absolute. It evolves based on desa-kaala-paatra. There is nothing =\r\nimpure or corrupt about it.\n\nAt the end of the day, the key is whether one =\r\nis actually doing some sadhana on a regular basis or not, whether it is cau=\r\nsing internal transformation in one or not, and whether it helps in one&#39;s s=\r\npiritual progress or not.\n\n* * *\n\nLet me cut & paste a section from a write=\r\nup I wrote for an upcoming occasion. It contains an analogy given earlier a=\r\nnd addresses some relevant issues.\n\n------------ --------- --------\nDo Veda=\r\ns Describe External Rituals\n\nSome people believe that Veda describes the sp=\r\necifics about various external yagyas. Veda is supposed to be absolute, tim=\r\neless and uncreated knowledge that is not bound by desa-kaala-paatra. How c=\r\nan descriptions of specific external rituals be unbound by desa-kaala-paatr=\r\na?\n\nThough Sayanacharya=E2=80=99s celebrated commentary on RigVeda is ritua=\r\nlistic in nature, Aurobindo Ghose had a different take in his =E2=80=9CSecr=\r\net of the Veda=E2=80=9D. His view is that Veda talks about absolute truths =\r\nabout the inner self and not relative truths about external matters. Agni o=\r\nr Fire symbolizes the divine Will. That is why it is the immortal in mortal=\r\ns. Its rhythm will devour everything that is perishable and purify all. Whi=\r\nle fire in a fire ritual symbolizes the divine Will, various offerings in i=\r\nt symbolize various aspects of one=E2=80=99s conditioning and the smoke sym=\r\nbolizes one=E2=80=99s passions and desires.\n\nMetaphor: Vedic Homam vs Aagam=\r\nic Homam\n\nNotions that so and so yagya ritual is sanctioned by Veda and so =\r\nand so aagamic/tantric yagya ritual is not sanctioned by Veda can be put in=\r\n perspective using a metaphor.\n\nOnce there were many people who lived near =\r\nthe sea [Aatman]. They regularly sat by the sea and enjoyed the sight and s=\r\nound of the sea [absorbed in Aatman most of the time]. They described the s=\r\nea in some nice cryptic poems [Veda].\n\nAs people started living a little aw=\r\nay from the sea [less spiritually evolved], someone had to put together som=\r\ne instructions on how to reach the sea. He said, &quot;keep walking towards east=\r\n&quot; and the instructions grew with time. People faithfully followed the instr=\r\nuctions [rituals].\n\nPeople started moving further and further inland and st=\r\narted living in a landlocked desert far away from the sea. This generation =\r\nhad never seen a pool of water like a lake, let alone a sea. They faithfull=\r\ny performed the ritual of walking towards east, but did not find sea. They =\r\ndebated endlessly whether one had to walk one mile or two miles or three mi=\r\nles and formed different schools of thought. Some walked their chosen dista=\r\nnce, found a tree or a building or some interesting object and even became =\r\nsatisfied that that was sea!\n\nThen came some great person, whose instincts =\r\nled him to take a horse instead of walking and ride it for a long distance =\r\n[use of other tools]. He did find the sea after a few months. He put togeth=\r\ner newer instructions to reach the sea, which included riding a horse [new =\r\n=C3=A4gama and tantra].\n\nPeople performing the old rituals objected to this=\r\n and said &quot;but then this horse thing is not granted by the book of sea. Thi=\r\ns is a new path and different from the &quot;pure&quot; sea ritual&quot; [pure Vedic ritua=\r\nl]. By now, people did not even understand what the cryptic poems of the or=\r\niginal &quot;book of sea&quot; mean, but they simply believed that those poems taught=\r\n the old &quot;pure&quot; sea rituals that they were used to. They were blissfully un=\r\naware that the original instructions were meant for someone already close t=\r\no sea and the newer instructions came from someone who actually saw the sea=\r\n and knew where they currently lived and how to get to the sea from there!\n=\r\n\nSlowly many new sets of instructions involving horses, chariots etc were t=\r\naught and many new paths to the sea were outlined instead of just instructi=\r\nng people to walk towards east [evolution of mantra/tantra/ yantras].\n\nOne =\r\nparticular path through jungles was dangerous [aghora and other dark tantri=\r\nc paths involving practice of sex, meat, wine etc]. Though the distance to =\r\nsea was much shorter through that jungle, it was just too dangerous and onl=\r\ny the bravest and strongest could make it. There were cruel dacoits and wil=\r\nd animals [chance of a fall in a risky ritual] and many weak people travell=\r\ning to sea via that path were killed. A wise man who knew the entire territ=\r\nory well came forward, condemned that path and discouraged people from tryi=\r\nng that path. Since then, even people who were strong enough to successfull=\r\ny make it in that path desisted from it.\n\nAs time progressed, people starte=\r\nd fighting too much about whose path was superior. They were foolish, not s=\r\nmart enough to adopt the original instructions, of either the so-called &quot;pu=\r\nre&quot; sea path or the so-called &quot;new&quot; path or other variations, for the chang=\r\ned geography and changed times. Many followed the instructions blindly, hit=\r\n roadblocks and did not reach sea. Many did not even know that &quot;reaching th=\r\ne sea&quot; was the actual goal of all their joirneys. They only thought they we=\r\nre supposed to follow the instructions faithfully and there was no need to =\r\nadopt to the changed geographical territory and time. They even condemned t=\r\nhose who actually went to sea, came back and gave updated directions for th=\r\neir place and time, for violating tradition.\n\nIn case the analogy is not cl=\r\near, here is a brief summary of its points. Veda is about realizing self. V=\r\nedic deities such as Agni, Indra, Mitra, Varuna, Aswins, Brihaspati etc are=\r\n slightly different aspects of Aatman. Veda describes various aspects of th=\r\ne state of self-realization. That is why it is considered the highest knowl=\r\nedge. Other allied subjects throw some light on possible ways to reach that=\r\n state. While definitive and absolute statements can be made on the actual =\r\nstate of self-realization itself, no definitive statements can be made on h=\r\now to reach it. Only relative statements can be made based on desa-kaala-pa=\r\natra. The path depends on one&#39;s current position!\n\nGreat men in many spirit=\r\nual paths, within Hinduism as well as outside of it, came, experienced that=\r\n state, understood the current state of people around them and gave specifi=\r\nc instructions on how to reach that state from the current state. Some foll=\r\nowed the instructions and experienced the state. Some instead kept arguing =\r\nabout the contradictions between paths.\n\nStop Arguing and Do Sadhana\n\nAs th=\r\ne metaphor above illustrates, arguments about various paths are irrelevant =\r\nand distracting. What is important is to pick a path and follow it. Whether=\r\n one does a Vedic homam or an Aagamic homam is a secondary issue. The prima=\r\nry issues are whether one does homam or not, how focused one is, how one=E2=\r\n=80=99s focus is improving and how one is being transformed internally.\n\nJu=\r\nst as a twenty course meal eaten once every six months does not give much e=\r\nnergy to one, a =E2=80=9Cbig=E2=80=9D homam or another ritual done once eve=\r\nry six months or a year does not boost one=E2=80=99s spiritual or material =\r\npursuits. Just as a small bowl of rice and lentil soup eaten everyday gives=\r\n more energy to one, a small 20-30 minute homam done everyday gives a boost=\r\n to one=E2=80=99s spiritual evolution.\n\nWise Tradeoffs\n\nSuppose the preside=\r\nnt of the country is visiting one for lunch with 100 associates. One can in=\r\nvite all the 100 associates of the President by name and seat them in the r=\r\noom individually, following various protocols. Then one can exchange long p=\r\nleasantries with the President and then offer lunch.\n\nSuppose one is in a h=\r\nurry and has very little time. If one still invites all the 100 associates =\r\nby name and seats them in the room individually following the protocol and =\r\ndoes not have enough time to let the President eat lunch in the end, is it =\r\na wise tradeoff? Or is it wiser to invite all the 100 associates together a=\r\nnd seat them together by violating the protocol and use that time to let th=\r\ne President eat in peace?\n\nSimilarly, is it wise if one exchanges long plea=\r\nsantries and gives very little time to eat? Or should one cut short on the =\r\npleasantries and give more time to eat?\n\nIn a fire ritual, making offerings=\r\n to the main deity is the primary part. Various upacharas done to the deity=\r\n before the offerings commence is secondary. Various preliminary and final =\r\nsteps and offerings to associate deities are tertiary. If one has a few hou=\r\nrs for the fire ritual, one can do everything given in scriptures leisurely=\r\n. If one has only 20-30 minutes, one needs to make wise tradeoffs and maxim=\r\nize the benefit. It is far better than doing nothing.\n\n&lt;sections deleted&gt;\n\n=\r\nProof of the Pudding\n\nAt this time, more than hundred people are doing a ho=\r\nmam to some deity or the other, everyday. Spending time worshipping god in =\r\nfire for 20-30 min (or more) everyday, with an attitude of surrender and wi=\r\nth some basic intellectual understanding of the absolute truths expounded b=\r\ny Veda and Upanishads, can do a world of good to one=E2=80=99s spiritual ev=\r\nolution. The proof of the pudding is in eating it. One can try to perform a=\r\n short homam everyday for a few months and see for oneself if there is a di=\r\nfference in one=E2=80=99s attitude, focus and clarity of thinking.\n--------=\r\n---- --------- --------\n\nBest regards,\nNarasimha\n------------ --------- ---=\r\n------ --------- --------- --------- -\nFree Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish =\r\nLessons, Jyotish Writings,\n&quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam =\r\nand Pitri Tarpana:\nhttp://www.VedicAst rologer.org\nFilms that make a differ=\r\nence: http://SaraswatiFil ms.org\nSpirituality: http://groups. yahoo.com/ gr=\r\noup/vedic- wisdom\nJyotish writings: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/Jyotish=\r\nWri tings\n------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- --------- -\n=\r\n\n---- moulamagamagguru &lt;moulamagamagguru@ yahoo.in&gt; wrote: \n&gt; Dear Members,=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; At the outset, thanks to Shri.Rajarshy Nandy for guiding me into this=\r\n forum. I had posted a message in jHora in response to a forward from Jyoti=\r\nshwritings on &quot;efficacy of remedies&quot;. I humbly agree that jHora is not the =\r\nright forum for discussing these topics.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have gone through the homam=\r\n manual provided by Sri.Narasimhaji and the video of a homam being performe=\r\nd and have the following observations to make.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. As per rules laid ou=\r\nt by srouta and gruhya sutras which describe the preocedures for various ri=\r\ntuals, any yajna (homam) can only be a vikruti of the darsapoornamasa (whic=\r\nh is the prakruti of all yajnas).\n&gt; \n&gt; 2. All steps in darsapoornamasa shou=\r\nld be there in the homam procedure (some exist in tooshnee or amantraka for=\r\nm, but it has to be there). We are nobody to judge which are essential and =\r\nwhich are not essential. They are laid down by vedas and later elaborated b=\r\ny acharyas.\n&gt; \n&gt; 3. There are variations in procedures in the different sut=\r\nras such as apastamba sutra, bohayana sutra, asvalayana sutra etc., but no =\r\nomissions.\n&gt; \n&gt; 4. The ordinary materials such as fire wood, grains, ghee e=\r\ntc. become worthy of divine usage only when they are divinised using the ri=\r\nght procedure. Then only it becomes a divine procedure. Otherwise it is onl=\r\ny a &quot;fire ritual&quot; as named. I suggest reading of the volumnous work &quot;Agni&quot; =\r\nby Frits Staal to get a insight into the importance of these steps.\n&gt; \n&gt; 5.=\r\n The procedure in the manual is not as laid out by any of the sutras. There=\r\n are large deviations and omissions. It looks like a mix of vedic and tantr=\r\nik procedures. \n&gt; \n&gt; 6. In paristarana or laying the darbha aorund the kund=\r\na there is a particular manner in which the tips of succeeding darbhas are =\r\ntucked under the bottom of the prceeding ones.\n&gt; \n&gt; 7. The direction for sp=\r\nrinkling water (mantra parishkekam) with the mantra &quot;deva savita prasuva&quot; i=\r\ne:- #4 is shown to be from SE corner to NE corner. This can not be because =\r\napasavya is for pitru karyas. It is in a circle starting from NE corner and=\r\n ending at NE corner (Eshaadi eeshaantam).\n&gt; \n&gt; 8 Patraasadanam or keeping =\r\nthe vessels and ladles used in the vessel above darbha is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 9.P=\r\nrokshanee samskaram and prokshanam for purification of the utensils is miss=\r\ning.\n&gt; \n&gt; 10. Patra samskaram or purifying the utensils is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 11=\r\n. Praneeta samskaram, varuna avahanam on praneeta, varuna poojanam and aacc=\r\nhadanam (covering of praneeta with darbha) is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 12. Brahma vara=\r\nnam ( at least a koorcha brahma) is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 13. Ajya samskaram or pur=\r\nification of the ghee and paryagnikaranam of the homa dravya used for havan=\r\n is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 14. Darvee samskaram or purification of ladles used in th=\r\ne homam is missing. Always to spoons are to be used (sruksruvou) .\n&gt; \n&gt; 15.=\r\n Placement of paridhi and aagharasamit is missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 16. Idhma pradanam =\r\nor placement of a fixed number of samits in the agni iis missing.\n&gt; \n&gt; 17. =\r\nIt is seen in the video that with a single dip of the ladle in the ghee, mu=\r\nltiple ahutis are given in drops. There is fixed quantity of ghee to be giv=\r\nen in each ahuti. Otherwise it will lead to dravyalopa.\n&gt; \n&gt; and many more =\r\n............\n&gt; \n&gt; 18. Strictly speaking, in the vedic procedure the deity i=\r\ns not invoked into agni. Agni alone exists in the kunda and he acts as carr=\r\nier for the other gods (havya vahaka). Depending on the name of deity prono=\r\nunced in satva tyaga, agni carries the offering to the particular deity. If=\r\n at all deity is invoked it is gaunam (secondary or not necessary)\n&gt; \n&gt; 18.=\r\n In the tantrik procedure, the deity is invoked into the kunda and the agni=\r\n acts either as the jadharagni of the deity or the agni itself is converted=\r\n into the deity (agnyatmaka) by offering the specified agni devata aikya ah=\r\nutis.\n&gt; \n&gt; 19. Very good alternate homa procedures are available in the man=\r\ntra sastra (refer Mantra maharnava for example) ideal for sadhakas. They do=\r\nn&#39;t involve veda mantras so that you don&#39;t have to struggle to get the righ=\r\nt pronunciation and svaras. These procedures are designed for mantra sadhak=\r\nas who perform homam on their own. They can be easily adapted to perfrom ho=\r\nmam for any devata.\n&gt; \n&gt; 20. Homam should not be seen as a 20 minute Jane F=\r\nonda work out that can be learned from a video. It involves learning from a=\r\nn able guru and practice with devotion, precision and perfection.\n&gt; \n&gt; 21. =\r\nI suggest that we preserve each branch of knowledge in its own purity. Hybr=\r\nids may not always yield good results. Let almighty help to preserve knowle=\r\ndge uncorrupted.\n&gt; \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\r\n--0-296116206-1277100869=:29280\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=utf-8\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;table cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot; border=3D&quot;0&quot; &gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td valign=3D&quot;=\r\ntop&quot; style=3D&quot;font: inherit;&quot;&gt;&lt;DIV id=3Dyiv1754061708&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Dear Rajarshiji=\r\n,&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;Elevated status of Usha&lt;/U&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;U&gt;&lt;/U&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;1.Sun ,the illuminator follows the movement o=\r\nf Usha.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;2.

This elevated status is not there in th=\r\ne moola veda, or this elevated status is not exclusive to any particular de=\r\nity. It is&nbsp; the commentator&#39;s or interpretor&#39;s or upanishadkara&#39;s view=\r\n. For that matter the gayatri mantra also does not have any elevated status=\r\n in the moola veda. It is later texts such as Debi bhagavatam which accorde=\r\nd the elevated status to gayatri.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Each one pic=\r\nks up his own favourite deity or concept and starts glorifying it to the ex=\r\nclusion of all others often misleading people.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV=\r\n&gt;Look at Brihadaranyakopanishad, similar elevated status is given to the ho=\r\nrse sacrificed in asvamedha (Usha vaa asvasya medhyasya sirah ..........).&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;If you think allegory is the essence of the ve=\r\ndas, please try to explain the allegory of the following mantras for exampl=\r\ne.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;1.&quot; Samsrushtam dhanamubhayam samahrutamasm=\r\nabhyam dhattam varunascha manyuh.
