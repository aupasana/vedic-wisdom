What will be our cond=\r\nition if we were tested by The Mother? Period.\n\n***\nYou have passionately r=\r\naised some questions in defense and i find nothing wrong in it but One thin=\r\ng i wish to pin point and that is the Pain of embarrassment such episodes g=\r\nives to follower of Sanaatan Dharma. There may not be anything wrong, if a =\r\nSaadhu which is very popular on TV, Media and having a great many followers=\r\n, enjoys sexual pleasures but at the same time he preaches the same and doe=\r\ns not hide it. If someone preaches sublime knowledge and talk about Brahmac=\r\nharya but if he/she does not admit own weakness, it is a gross.\nI whole hea=\r\nrtedly respect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extremely truthful in hi=\r\ns &#39;Satyana Prayogo&#39; about his own weakness and his struggles on sexual matt=\r\ners. It is a rarest of rare frankness for a person of such a stature in soc=\r\niety. He really was a Saadhu.\n\nThere is a big difference between fall of a =\r\nPopular Spiritual Master and a normal person. If Sri Sri Ravishankar didn&#39;t=\r\n fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big embarrassment for us, t=\r\nhen a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spiritual Master, in front of the w=\r\nhole world is even bigger pain and embarrassment. It is a bigger blow to fa=\r\niths of general public.\n\nI am not specific on Satyananda here because i do =\r\nnot know if it is really true.\n\nIf the footage is right, then i fancy here =\r\nthat such shocks and shameful episodes are needed to steer clear Sanaatan D=\r\nharma. The Mother may be pushing such bitter pills so that corruption is fi=\r\nnally controlled and reduced to very minimum.\n\n&gt; Further, in this age of Ka=\r\nli the karmas and rnas have become so &gt;twisted and \n\nYou have spoken the tr=\r\nuth. The world today is many times more tempting then say even 100 years ba=\r\nck. It is better to be a married person (Even for a very elavated soul like=\r\n Vivekananda if comes back) and overcome the pleasure/pains of sexual desir=\r\nes.\n\nFinally, i would say that its high time for Big names and even Bigger =\r\nclaims Spiritual Masters start taking a leaf out of Vimalananda or Mahatma =\r\nGandhi&#39;s bold approach to the subject of physical and mental Sex (Which is =\r\n*One of the* prilimianry steps in final Brahmacharya. )\n\nIt reminds me of S=\r\nant Tukaaram&#39;s famous line\n&quot;Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tyaachi Vandaavi Paule&quot;\n=\r\n\nBest Regards,\n\nUtpal \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com, rajarshi nan=\r\ndy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste,\n&gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; I too believe we =\r\nshould give the benefit of doubt to Swami Nityananda.

But in the times to come, the idea of runnin=\r\ng after a guru will change. Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep=\r\n doing sadhana and Nature will teach in the best possible way.

What will be our condition if=\r\n we were tested by The Mother? Period.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;***&lt;BR&gt;You have passionately =\r\nraised some questions in defense and i find nothing wrong in it but One thi=\r\nng i wish to pin point and that is the Pain of embarrassment such episodes =\r\ngives to follower of Sanaatan Dharma. There may not be anything wrong, if a=\r\n Saadhu which is very popular on TV, Media and having a great many follower=\r\ns, enjoys sexual pleasures but at the same time he preaches the same and\n d=\r\noes not hide it. If someone preaches sublime knowledge and talk about Brahm=\r\nacharya but if he/she does not admit own weakness, it is a gross.&lt;BR&gt;I whol=\r\ne heartedly respect Mahatma Gandhi in one sense. He was extremely truthful =\r\nin his &#39;Satyana Prayogo&#39; about his own weakness and his struggles on sexual=\r\n matters. It is a rarest of rare frankness for a person of such a stature i=\r\nn society. He really was a Saadhu.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;There is a big difference between=\r\n fall of a Popular Spiritual Master and a normal person. If Sri Sri Ravisha=\r\nnkar didn&#39;t fare well in a debate against Zakir Naik, is a big embarrassmen=\r\nt for us, then a (un)spectacular fall of a popular Spiritual Master, in fro=\r\nnt of the whole world is even bigger pain and embarrassment. It is a bigger=\r\n blow to faiths of general public.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am not specific on Satyananda h=\r\nere because i do not know if it is really true.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;If the footage is ri=\r\nght, then i fancy here that such shocks and shameful episodes are\n needed t=\r\no steer clear Sanaatan Dharma. The Mother may be pushing such bitter pills =\r\nso that corruption is finally controlled and reduced to very minimum.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;B=\r\nR&gt;&gt; Further, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so &gt;=\r\ntwisted and &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;You have spoken the truth. The world today is many time=\r\ns more tempting then say even 100 years back. It is better to be a married =\r\nperson (Even for a very elavated soul like Vivekananda if comes back) and o=\r\nvercome the pleasure/pains of sexual desires.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Finally, i would say t=\r\nhat its high time for Big names and even Bigger claims Spiritual Masters st=\r\nart taking a leaf out of Vimalananda or Mahatma Gandhi&#39;s bold approach to t=\r\nhe subject of physical and mental Sex (Which is *One of the* prilimianry st=\r\neps in final Brahmacharya. )&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;It reminds me of Sant Tukaaram&#39;s famous=\r\n line&lt;BR&gt;&quot;Jaisa Bole Taisa Chale tyaachi Vandaavi Paule&quot;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Best Regard=\r\ns,&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Utpal &lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;--- In &lt;A\n rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups=\r\n. com&lt;/A&gt;, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@ ...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Na=\r\nmaste,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; I too believe we should give the benefi=\r\nt of doubt to Swami Nityananda. There are some questions one has to ask her=\r\ne:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 1) How reliable is vedio. Tehelka, which di=\r\nd the sting operation,=C3=82&nbsp;is a VERY questionable organization.&lt;BR&gt;&=\r\ngt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; 2) Second, how does one know whether Swami Nityana=\r\nnda was not practising say some sexual ritual?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n 3) What exactly is the big fuss if a Swami, and a reasonable good one, has=\r\n sex with someone?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; We live in such times where=\r\n Mahamaya has made it almost impossible for even VERY advanced souls to rem=\r\nain perfect brahmacharis from birth till death. Souls who might have been b=\r\nrahmacharis in all previous births, would=C3=82&nbsp;probably=C3=82&nbsp; n=\r\not be able to remain so when born in thid age=C3=82&nbsp;is a\n simple fact =\r\nof nature, otherwise how else is Kali Yuga to be different from other yugas=\r\n? She wants it that way and so it is that way.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n Further, in this age of Kali the karmas and rnas have become so twisted an=\r\nd complex that untill you pay back the rnas, it will keep hounding you. How=\r\n is one going to overcome that? Our society too is steeped in unnecessary p=\r\nrudishness and misconceptions about lust and spirituality. &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; All said and done, Vimalanada - whom I consider to be one of =\r\nthe greatest Saints who lived - took 6 years of struggle to overcome lust. =\r\nWhat to speak of ordianry sadhus and saints?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; A=\r\nnd finally, it is q&#92;uite possible that Swami Nityananda *maybe* a fake guru=\r\n. We do not know. But in the times to come, the idea of running after a gur=\r\nu will change. Each one must take God as his/her guru and keep doing sadhan=\r\na and Nature will teach in the best possible way. In this regard,\n fire can=\r\n act as an excellent guru if one keeps doing homas for some years. &lt;BR&gt;&gt;=\r\n =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; -Regards&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;Rajarshi&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbs=\r\np;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &quot;Between me and You, there is only me.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; T=\r\nake away the me, so only You remain&quot; - Hallaj&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; --- On Thu, =\r\n4/3/10, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt; wrote:&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =\r\nFrom: Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Re:=\r\n Sex scandals by spiritual gurus&lt;BR&gt;&gt; To: &lt;A rel=3Dnofollow&gt;vedic-wisdom=\r\n@ yahoogroups. com&lt;/A&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&gt; Date: Thursday, 4 March, 2010, 8:26 AM&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; =C3=82&nbsp; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Namas=\r\nte KK,&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; No matter how genuine the video may look, let us gi=\r\nve the benefit of doubt to Paramahamsa\n Nithyananda and not jump to conclus=\r\nions as someone said.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; *Even if* his=\r\n expose on video is genuine, it is only a reminder that nobody is free from=\r\n Mahamaya&#39;s web.

Irrespective of his wea=\r\nknesses that may have been exposed now, he is clearly a man of excellent kn=\r\nowledge and rare wisdom.

Tak=\r\ne your mind off god for a second\n and you CAN fall. When we are not in a st=\r\nate where mind is focused on god 24x7, we are vulnerable to a fall. Then wh=\r\ny should we judge others?&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; The most =\r\nimportant thing is to surrender to Her (or Him) and keep that attitude of a=\r\n dedicated servant forever. There may be some members of this group who mak=\r\ne good progress in the coming years and people around them may start notici=\r\nng their purity and treating them specially. The key is to not be swayed by=\r\n name, fame, image, following, respect, money etc and retain the mindset of=\r\n a dedicated servant, in the midst of either adulation or adversity. If one=\r\n allows self-consciousness, ego and pride to take root in one&#39;s mind, one t=\r\nhing leads to another and one falls in the web of Mahamaya.&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt=\r\n; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Even if a spiritual master really had weaknesses a=\r\nnd fell, we do not benefit whatsoever by discussing those weaknesses. If we=\r\n instead discuss his\n teachings, we may still benefit. A blue sky does not =\r\nsuddenly become green if the greatest liar says sky is blue. Similarly, spi=\r\nritual truths do not become invalid if a person who taught them fell.&lt;BR&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; * * *&lt;BR&gt;&gt; &lt;BR&gt;&gt; Perhaps an increase of dharma is not pos=\r\nsible without exposing and weeding out some adharma, atleast in key places.=\r\n We can never know for sure what the Mother has in store.
