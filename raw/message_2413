In other words,  Atman is unknown to him whose intellect is not refined (Asamskrita Buddheh Avigneyam). as Sankaracharya puts it.   Atman is the witness of all the pulsations  of the Budhhi, which is the  highest product of evolution.  A pure Intellect is closet to Brahman( Nedishtam Brahma).  What the senses fail to achieve viz., Realization of the Atman is achieved by the Buddhi.   Atman is the very centre of the Buddhi, where it becomes self-revealed.  Even at the cost of repetition it may be pointed out that Intellect here does not refer to the sense-bound equipment possessed by each one of us  but a Buddhi that has the light of Atman playing upon it, that embraces the totality of of experiences and that takes into account the data of the\n states of waking, dream and dreamless sleep. \n \nAtman is distinct from the body, sense organs, mind,intellect and our Vasanas . Nevertheless, it is a witness of  their  functions  like a king .  Atman is called Panchakosaatheetha ie., it transcends all the five sheaths which are created by the identification of the Atman with Gross Body etc.  Atma is the substratum from which all activities emanate either in the form of subtle manifestations as thoughts and desires within or gross expressions as perceptions and actions in the external world.  The Katopanishad puts it this way: &quot; Just as one fire having reached various wicks expresses itself as different flames, so also the one Truth(Atma) burning different bosoms ( Sarvabhutaantaratma) expresses as the good, the bad, the wretched, the noble etc.&quot;  Though it is the activating principle, Atman remains ever detached and  and independent of all activities. It is a mere witness( Sakshi) .   It is never involved in any of the activities.   In its prescence\n every being bristles into activity  just as everybody becomes alert and active at the sight of Swamy in Puttaparthy.  It has no activity of its own.  Swamy activates all his devotees and students   but Himself remains a detached observer of them. \n(to be continued)\nG.Balasubramanian\n\n\n      \r\n--0-673592162-1251929776=:38792\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=us-ascii\r\n\r\n&lt;html&gt;&lt;head&gt;&lt;style type=&quot;text/css&quot;&gt;&lt;!-- DIV {margin:0px;} --&gt;&lt;/style&gt;&lt;/head&gt;&lt;body&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family:arial,helvetica,sans-serif;font-size:14pt&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=&quot;2&quot; face=&quot;Tahoma&quot;&gt;----- Forwarded Message ----&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;From:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; G Balasubramanian &lt;gbsub@...&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;To:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; viprasamhitha@...&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Sent:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; Wednesday, September 2, 2009 10:15:14 AM&lt;br&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;span style=&quot;font-weight: bold;&quot;&gt;Subject:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/b&gt; SOME THOUGHTS ON ATMA--5&lt;br&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: arial,helvetica,sans-serif; font-size: 14pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div style=&quot;font-family: times new roman,new york,times,serif; font-size: 12pt;&quot;&gt;&lt;div class=&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;The Katopanishad declares that the Atman being hidden in all beings is not manifest to all but can be realized by all who are&nbsp; accustomed to inquire into subtle truths by means of their sharp&nbsp; and subtle intellect.&nbsp; In other words, &nbsp;Atman is unknown to him whose intellect is not refined \n&lt;i&gt;(Asamskrita Buddheh Avigneyam&lt;/i&gt;). as Sankaracharya puts it.&nbsp; &nbsp;Atman is the witness of all the pulsations&nbsp; of the Budhhi, which is the&nbsp; highest product of evolution.&nbsp; A pure Intellect is closet to &lt;i&gt;Brahman( Nedishtam Brahma).&nbsp; What the senses fail to achieve viz., Realization of the Atman is achieved by the Buddhi.\n&lt;/i&gt;&nbsp; Atman is the very centre of the Buddhi, where it becomes self-revealed.&nbsp; Even at the cost of repetition it may be pointed out that Intellect here does not refer to the sense-bound equipment possessed by each one of us&nbsp; but a Buddhi that has the light of Atman playing upon it, that embraces the totality of of experiences and that takes into account the data of the states of waking, dream and dreamless sleep.\n&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;&lt;/b&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;b&gt;Atman is distinct from the body, sense organs, mind,intellect and our Vasanas .
