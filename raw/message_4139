I do agree on that but should it not be possible to measure so=\r\nmething tangible like admission rates in a mental asylum if the full moon/n=\r\new moon/amavasya was having a effect.\n\nI generally agree on the fact that m=\r\nodern scientific journals have an pre-existing bias against anything relate=\r\nd to traditions or spirituality but so many other studies have also come up=\r\n empty handed.\n\n\nI was wondering aloud in the group that truly what has bee=\r\nn said in the group previously is absolutely correct. Instead of worrying a=\r\nbout intonation of mantras, so and so rituals...so and so timing ,maybe it =\r\nis best to perform homa with the attitude of a child at the footsteps of th=\r\ne mother.\n\nI am inclined to beleive no other rule/timing of the ritual  mat=\r\nters and was just wondering aloud on that.\n\nRegards\nVemparla Ram Kishore \n\n=\r\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Jacques Le Vangie &lt;mojavecowboy@...&gt; =\r\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Hello:\n&gt; \n&gt; I think that even modern western physics would ackno=\r\nwledge that time itself has geography and is not simply a steady state. The=\r\nrefore choosing different times for meditation may make a difference. I hav=\r\ne not heard that full moon meditation is particularly useful. \n&gt; \n&gt; Under w=\r\nestern astrology, there are certain planetary aspects that enhance various =\r\nactivities. These vary according to the planets and angles involved. Medita=\r\ntion may fall into this category. Again, these times may or may not have to=\r\n do with full moon cycles. \n&gt; \n&gt; Whether the masses are becoming less spiri=\r\ntual is not something to which I can attest, yet I believe that belief in t=\r\nhe religion of science, as epitomied by Scientific American, helps to lesse=\r\nn modern people&#39;s belief in traditional ways. The publishers of that magazi=\r\nne have an agenda, which is to diminish people&#39;s belief in traditions and t=\r\no separate them from living according to traditional calendars and schemes =\r\nof time. \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards, Jacques \n&gt; \n&gt; --- On Wed, 7/4/10, vemparlaramkishor=\r\ne &lt;vemparlaramkishore@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt; \n&gt; From: vemparlaramkishore &lt;vemparlara=\r\nmkishore@...&gt;\n&gt; Subject: [vedic-wisdom] Full Moon effect on Meditation\n&gt; To=\r\n: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&gt; Received: Wednesday, 7 April, 2010, 4:33 P=\r\nM\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; =C2=A0\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;   \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt;     \n&gt;       \n&gt;      =\r\n \n&gt;       Narasimha ji\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I have read the advice of many spiritual =\r\nmasters and other seers say that an full moon meditation is very beneficial=\r\n . Also related to this is the question of how do planets really affect us =\r\n, Vimalananda in the aghora books says it is through the rasa or food that =\r\nis ingested by us. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; I know science does not yet possess the righ=\r\nt tools to measure this phenomena and einstein&#39;s grand search for a unified=\r\n filed theory and the universal particle is still ongoing and might take ag=\r\nes for modern science to understand the workings of even a commonplace phen=\r\nomena like gravitation.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; However a simple test like admission rat=\r\nes in a mental aslyum should hold up to proof if the moon is truly having a=\r\n effect on humans.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; http://www.scientif icamerican. com/article. =\r\ncfm?id=3Dlunacy- and-the-full- moon\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; This article in the scientif=\r\nic american finds no such correlation. ..also there have been many studies =\r\nin the past some for and some against this correlation effect but none of t=\r\nhem found a strong evidence.... And always there is the risk of mistaking c=\r\norrelation as causation in any experiment.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; It is just out of cur=\r\niosity that am asking this question...Does astrology matter at all for a se=\r\nrious sadhaka. Can not any day /time or hour be picked for worship. If the =\r\nrelationship with the deity is truly personal why should one even consider =\r\nthe nava grahas in the ritual worship. I increasingly find that astrology i=\r\ns only serving to discourage the masses rather than pointing them in the di=\r\nrection of worship of divinity. \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Hope you could throw some light=\r\n on this.\n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; \n&gt; Regards\n&gt; \n&gt; Vemparla Ram Kishore\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
