Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;wrote:\n\n&gt;\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Rajarshi,\n&gt;\n&gt;  You have a knack for asking important questions, that sound simple but\n&gt; touch upon deep issues.\n&gt;\n&gt; &gt; I mean if I am focusing on Mahaganapati, am I just bringing out the\n&gt; &gt; energy of Mahaganapati from inside me or is there one single, universal,\n&gt; &gt; omnipotent divinty called Mahaganapati who exists in the universe, and\n&gt; &gt; I am trying to invite him into the fire?\n&gt;\n&gt; Terms like internal god and external god are just a manner of speaking, for\n&gt; easy understanding and simplification of concepts. In reality, a deity\n&gt; existing microcosmically &quot;inside&quot; you, a deity existing microcosmically\n&gt; inside me, a deity existing microcosmically inside someone else and a deity\n&gt; existing &quot;externally&quot; in the macrocosm (universe) is one and the same and\n&gt; there is absolutely no difference between all of them! That is essentially\n&gt; the Upanishadic understanding.\n&gt;\n&gt; In fact, when you say &quot;inside me&quot;, ask yourself : &quot;what is this I&quot;? Is it\n&gt; the physical body? Is it the subtle body? Is it the causal body? When mind\n&gt; entertains the notion that it is a physical body, it indeed becomes aware of\n&gt; a physical body and looks at it as I. When mind entertains the notion that\n&gt; it is a subtle body, it indeed becomes aware of a subtle body and looks it\n&gt; as I. When mind entertains the notion that it is a causal body, it indeed\n&gt; becomes aware of a causal body and looks it as I. When mind finally\n&gt; overcomes all such notions one after the other, it may look at the\n&gt; supra-cosmic body (supreme cosmic being) as I. According to upanishadic\n&gt; understanding, there is nothing other than Brahman or supreme cosmic being.\n&gt; Thus, expressions like &quot;inside me&quot;, &quot;inside you&quot; and &quot;inside him&quot; are just\n&gt; expressions that describe false notions rather than reality. There is no\n&gt; real you, I and he, but there is only a supreme cosmic being.\n&gt;\n&gt;  *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; When you have a conditioned mind, which has a notion that there is a\n&gt; certain entity called &quot;Rajarshi Nandy&quot;, an entity called &quot;Narasimha Rao&quot;\n&gt; etc, these entities exist within your mind, for as long as your mind can\n&gt; keep those notions alive. When all such false notions are successfully\n&gt; eliminated, only supreme cosmic being is left for the mind to focus on.\n&gt;\n&gt; When a conditioned mind that has a notion that it is a specific person\n&gt; called &quot;Rajarshi Nandy&quot; in a specific body, such a mind is pre-occupied with\n&gt; so many things that it cannot focus itself on god perfectly. Due to its\n&gt; pre-occupations, it can only focus itself on small aspects of god, in a very\n&gt; limited way. This is like a mirror capturing Sun in a limited way. Sun&#39;s\n&gt; image may be reflected on 100 mirrors in 100 ways. One mirror may be broken\n&gt; and dark colored. It may reflect very little sunlight and sun may appear\n&gt; broken. Like that, each mind can focus on god in a different way, to a\n&gt; different extent. We express this fact in alternate words by saying &quot;the\n&gt; mind focuses on internal god and he is limited&quot;.\n&gt;\n&gt; This is just a simple way to put things. In reality, the issue is not\n&gt; internal vs external. The issue is the mind&#39;s ability to perceive and focus\n&gt; on god. As the mind&#39;s pre-occupation with other things comes down and its\n&gt; ability to focus on god goes up, we say that the internal god is becoming\n&gt; stronger. Again, this is just a way of representation. In reality, god,\n&gt; whether you call him internal or external, is infinite and does not become\n&gt; weaker or stronger. But mind can focus better and mind&#39;s idea of god becomes\n&gt; stronger. After all, a dirty mirror reflecting Sun may show a dirty and dull\n&gt; Sun at first and show a cleaner and brighter Sun after you clean the mirror.\n&gt; Sun has not really become cleaner or bighter. He is the same always. We can\n&gt; say &quot;Sun in the mirror&quot; has become cleaner and brighter. But there is really\n&gt; no Sun &quot;in the&quot; mirror! Though we may talk about Sun in mirror 1, Sun in\n&gt; mirror 2, Sun in mirror 3 and the external Sun, they are all one and the\n&gt; same!\n&gt;\n&gt; This manner of speaking about internal vs external god and talking about\n&gt; strengthening internal god is used to simplify things. Bottomline is that\n&gt; any visualization of god by a mind is limited by the conditioning, abilities\n&gt; and impurities of that mind. By allowing the mind to visualize god, to the\n&gt; best of its ability, on a regular basis, we sharpen its ability to visualize\n&gt; god. Eventually, mind loses all other pre-occupations and becomes fully\n&gt; absorbed in the infinite god. Then we say that internal god has become\n&gt; infinite. This is just a manner of speaking.\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; I want to give a small practical example, that is somewhat relevant and\n&gt; illustrates some concepts.\n&gt;\n&gt; Once a couple of priests with a high spiritual caliber were conducting a\n&gt; Rudraabhishekam. They were chanting Sree Rudram 11 times. A person who\n&gt; worships Mahaalakshmi was sitting in a corner of the room. He started to\n&gt; meditate with Savitru Gayatri mantra, his favorite mantra. Whichever mantra\n&gt; or deity he worships, he always considers everything to be an offering to\n&gt; Mahalakshmi and imagines only her as receiving the mantra. Here also, he was\n&gt; visualizing Mahalakshmi as filling his entire being and was offering Gayatri\n&gt; mantra to her. After a while, his Kundalini rose and his self-awareness was\n&gt; modified. He lost the regular awareness of body, perceived an all-pervading\n&gt; light that he was part of and remained in a nice spiritual state for a\n&gt; while. When he came back and the pooja was finished, one of the priests\n&gt; described something unusual that he &quot;saw&quot;. In the middle of the pooja, that\n&gt; priest turned towards this person and was surprised by what he saw. He saw a\n&gt; tall 18-handed form of Mahalakshmi standing in the place of this person for\n&gt; a little while.\n&gt;\n&gt; As that person meditated, his senses turned inward and he was looking\n&gt; internally. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshmi, who filled his entire\n&gt; being in his visualization. As Kundalini rose, his distinction of internal\n&gt; and external blurred and he perceived himself as *a part* of all-pervading\n&gt; light (it is neither &quot;internal&quot; nor &quot;external&quot;). He basically perceived\n&gt; Mahaalakshmi as the all-pervading light that he was also a part of. However,\n&gt; the priest who happened to look at him at that time was also in a purified\n&gt; state and so he noticed something. His mental conditioning at that time made\n&gt; him see a specific external form rather than an all-pervading form. But both\n&gt; the priest and the person perceived the same entity in two different ways.\n&gt; One was external and limited. The other was neither internal nor external\n&gt; (but obtained by looking internally at first) and unlimited. But, both are\n&gt; the same. They appeared different to two minds because of the conditioning\n&gt; of those minds rather than anything else, just as the same Sun may appear\n&gt; different in two different mirrors!\n&gt;\n&gt; *        *        *\n&gt;\n&gt; No amount of theorization will help one fully understand and appreciate\n&gt; things like this. The most important thing is to do some sadhana, such as\n&gt; homam or meditation, on a regular basis. No effort is wasted and eventually\n&gt; gives results when there is critical mass. Whatever I say, whatever masters\n&gt; have said before and whatever rishis taught in upanishads, can be understood\n&gt; and appreciated through direct experience. THAT is the goal of sadhana.\n&gt; Reading scriptures and mails like this is only a starting point. One has to\n&gt; engage in some sadhana. Even people like Ramana Maharshi, Ramakrishna\n&gt; Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swami, Vivekananda etc did sadhana for many years,\n&gt; before they realized god.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/homam&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&gt;\n&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Yourself: http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpana&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&gt;\n&gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom\n&gt; Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net\n&gt; Free Jyotish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&gt;\n&gt; Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;http://www.srijagannath.org/&gt;\n&gt; ------------------------------------------------------------------\n&gt;\n&gt; ----- Original Message -----\n&gt;   Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt;\n&gt; I little bit of deviation from this topic of this mail.\n&gt;\n&gt; There is something which I find a little confusion. I hope you will clear\n&gt; that point. You mentioned:\n&gt;\n&gt; *The god in your homam fire is not an external god, but your own internal\n&gt; god. Through your mental focus, you are projecting the limited manifestation\n&gt; of god inside you into fire and honing your ability to focus the mind on\n&gt; that god. I want to clarify one thing here. Though there is actually\n&gt; infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation with so many other things\n&gt; limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can focus on, access and\n&gt; perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow it. Fire is a good\n&gt; medium to project it for focusing better.*\n&gt; **\n&gt; When we are doing a homam or any puja, we are trying to create the deity\n&gt; from within ourselves where it exists. My questions is, is this where all\n&gt; deities reside(inside)? I mean if I am focusing on Mahaganapati, am I just\n&gt; bringing out the energy of Mahaganapati from inside me or is there one\n&gt; single, universal, omnipotent divinty called Mahaganapati who exists in the\n&gt; universe, and I am trying to invite him into the fire?\n&gt;\n&gt; I remember a line from Vimalananda where he says, initially we create the\n&gt; deity in the astral body so that this deity (the one we projected) *may *lead\n&gt; us to the real deity who exists outside in the universe.\n&gt;\n&gt; Did I understand the procedure correct? Kindly put down your thoughts on\n&gt; this.\n&gt;\n&gt; -Regards\n&gt;  Rajarshi\n&gt;\n&gt; --- On *Thu, 10/9/09, Narasimha PVR Rao &lt;pvr@...&gt;* wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt;  Namaste Krishna Kanth,\n&gt;\n&gt; Suppose god really came to your place in a human form and asked you to give\n&gt; him some nice food. Will you allow someone who cooks terribly to cook? Why\n&gt; not allow him to &quot;serve god&quot;?\n&gt;\n&gt; It is not just about &quot;serving god&quot;, but serving god *well*. A purified\n&gt; servant of god serves god with single-minded focus and devotion and has no\n&gt; other thoughts in mind when serving god. A more normal person may think\n&gt; various things in mind even when serving god. There is some\n&gt; self-centeredness and ego even in serving god.\n&gt;\n&gt; The god in your homam fire is not an external god, but your own internal\n&gt; god. Through your mental focus, you are projecting the limited manifestation\n&gt; of god inside you into fire and honing your ability to focus the mind on\n&gt; that god. I want to clarify one thing here. Though there is actually\n&gt; infinite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation with so many other things\n&gt; limits (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can focus on, access and\n&gt; perceive. By focusing on it more and more, you grow it. Fire is a good\n&gt; medium to project it for focusing better. On practice, the divinity inside\n&gt; you that you can focus on and perceive grows with time. Thus, remember that\n&gt; what is in fire is the limited manifestation of god inside you that you are\n&gt; able to focus, acces and perceive. This limited divinity should be nurtured\n&gt; slowly and allowed to grow, rather than used up for unnecessary things. When\n&gt; this divinity grows and becomes infinite, all your desires and other\n&gt; thoughts will vanish and you will be able to single-mindedly focus on that\n&gt; divinity. Some precautions will help you in the journey.\n&gt;\n&gt; Karmas and thoughts of people who are making offerings in your homam fire\n&gt; are basically being received in your internal god. If he has enough power\n&gt; (his power is, after all, the power of *your own* focus!) to grant a\n&gt; specific desire of someone, he may just do it. But that makes him weaker and\n&gt; who knows whether the desire was worthwhile?!\n&gt;\n&gt; Of course, when you are offering things in fire, you yourself may have some\n&gt; unnecessary desires which may slow down the spiritual progress. But, that is\n&gt; a necessary evil and there is no escape. But, why let someone else&#39;s desires\n&gt; cause an extra slow down?\n&gt;\n&gt; Thus, this is not a matter of political correctness and being nice.\n&gt;\n&gt; However, there is already a lot of karmic intermixing between people very\n&gt; closely connected to one karmically, like wife, children and parents. Wife&#39;s\n&gt; desires may affect husband&#39;s desires and mother&#39;s desires may affect son&#39;s\n&gt; desires already (atleast in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So\n&gt; there is no significant drawback to allowing them to share fire.\n&gt;\n&gt; Bottomline:\n&gt;\n&gt; If some people are so close to you that you want to allow their karmas and\n&gt; their desires to affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then\n&gt; allow such people to offer in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow\n&gt; specifically, some close people&#39;s karmas and desires may already be directly\n&gt; affecting your own karmas and desires and hence slowing you down!\n&gt;\n&gt; Usually, that would be immediate family, but you know your situation\n&gt; better.\n&gt;\n&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; Narasimha\n&gt;\n&gt; ---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&lt;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=narayan.iyer%40gmail.com&gt;&gt;\n&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Shri Krishna Kanth,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; I am sure Narasimha meant outside of your immediate family.

Needless to say, the last rites are considered very\n&gt; important ritual and is a privilege of the children, however, in this case\n&gt; since there was a karmic connection, the foreign student (whom the gentleman\n&gt; also considered as one of his spiritual children) ended up performing the\n&gt; ritual.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Regards\n&gt; &gt; Narayan\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroups. com&lt;http://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;,\n&gt; krishna Kanth &lt;kritels@... &gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Sri Narasimha garu & Narayan garu,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskaram.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &quot;Thus, allowing everyone to start or handle or making offerings into\n&gt; you fire can be inefficient at best and disastrous at worst&quot;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was little taken aback by this statement of your&#39;s, because when is\n&gt; sit to do Homam, my mother and my 2 yr old son would join me (90% of the\n&gt; times) and i have encouraged them to offer some sesame seeds along with me\n&gt; in the Homam while i read the Atharvaseersham.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; I was always under the thought process that, i&#39;m doing Homam and they\n&gt; are sitting with me and doing some seva to god along with me.

Then\n&gt; offerings in it will kindle your internal fire and streamline it, depending\n&gt; on how strong your identification is (it will get stronger with practice).\n&gt; If anyone handles that external fire or makes offerings in it, some karmas\n&gt; will be submitted by that person to your internal fire for burning. This\n&gt; intermingling of karmas can be allowed for people whose karmas are anyway\n&gt; intertwined, like husband and wife or parents and children. Of course, you\n&gt; can also take on karmas from the entire world if you are ready and willing\n&gt; to face their consequences, but a person with a strong individualized ego\n&gt; should limit the karmas one faces and work on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s\n&gt; ego becomes very subtle, it may be possible to take on more karmas and face\n&gt; their consequences. After all, if you start plucking leaves, flowers and\n&gt; fruits from a small plant, it will die. If you guard it and let it grow very\n&gt; &gt; &gt; big, it can give flowers and fruits to many more people. So, until you\n&gt; become very pure, keep working to burn your karmas and free yourself from\n&gt; the vaasanas (mental conditioning) caused by them.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; But some people use fire in the same way an idol is used. They allow\n&gt; anyone to start the fire in their homam, handle the fire and make offerings\n&gt; in it etc. If one who strongly identifies one&#39;s internal fire with external\n&gt; fire does such things, it can be disastrous. However, luckily, most people\n&gt; who follow this approach do not understand much about fire and do not have a\n&gt; strong identification with the fire. So, fire is practically like an idol\n&gt; for them and they do not benefit from fire as much as one can. Thus,\n&gt; allowing everyone to start or handle or making offerings into you fire can\n&gt; be inefficient at best and disastrous at worst.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; The best approach is: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. Only\n&gt; you make offerings in it. In your mind, identify it with your own internal\n&gt; fire (bhootaagni) that burns in the subtle body. If you do this for a while,\n&gt; a strong bond is indeed formed. Without your knowledge, the internal fire\n&gt; will become strong and burn various vaasanas.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (2) There are different methods for beeja, shakti and keelakam, though\n&gt; anga nyaasa and kara nyaasa are usually standard.. Do not worry about these\n&gt; things and do what you are used to or what you are more attracted to.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; As I said many times, these nyaasas are just formality for most people.\n&gt; Placing a letter in a particular body part has a higher significance than\n&gt; just touching a body part and saying the letter. Visualizing a specific body\n&gt; part vibrating with a specific sound is possible only after one makes\n&gt; sufficient progress in purifying one&#39;s subtle perception. So there is no\n&gt; point in discussing what is essentially a formality. I can tell you that\n&gt; this will not block you.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; (3) They should be shown in the video.

It will not block you..\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ---- gisundar &lt;gisundar@yahoo. com&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Namaskarams Narasimhaji,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I am planning to start doing regular Ganapathi homam (once in a\n&gt; week)starting this Sunday. I had a few queries . Request you to kindly\n&gt; answer them for me.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 1) During some homams performed at my home, I have seen the Vadhyar\n&gt; (priest) ask my mother to light the homam fire during the agni invocation. I\n&gt; am a Palaghat Iyer and on other ocassions when we had a namboothiri perform\n&gt; the homam he would light the homam fire himself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; My question is whether I can ask my wife to start the homam fire or\n&gt; do it myself ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 2) during the anganyasa and karanysa specifically the glaam beejam ,\n&gt; gleem shaktih , glaum kilakam mantraas/mudras , I used to touch the heart ,\n&gt; then right and left breasts respectively whereas in the video you have shown\n&gt; it to be heart , navel and below respctively. Is the beejam , shakthih and\n&gt; kilakam mudras /mantrams differnet for each diety ?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; 3) There are 4 more avhana mudras for suprIto bhava,suprasanno bhava,\n&gt; varado bhava, sarvAbhIshTaprado bhava. The manual does not talks about these\n&gt; mudras. Kindly let me know if these are imporatnt and how to show these\n&gt; mudras.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks and regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Girish Sundaram\n&gt;\n&gt;  \n&gt;\n\r\n--0016e6480ca606cbd204734fb77f\r\nContent-Type: text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\r\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: quoted-printable\r\n\r\n&lt;div&gt;Namasthe&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Please see this video, a story abou=\r\nt fishes in the pond and a swan (paramamhamsa).&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\na href=3D&quot;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DdUByEOTIJrM&amp;feature=3Drelate=\r\nd&quot;&gt;http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3DdUByEOTIJrM&amp;feature=3Drelated&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/=\r\ndiv&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div class=3D&quot;gmail_quote&quot;&gt;On Th=\r\nu, Sep 10, 2009 at 8:45 PM, Narasimha P.V.R.

In reality, a deity existing microcosmically &quot;in=\r\nside&quot; you, a deity existing microcosmically inside me, a deity existin=\r\ng microcosmically inside someone else and a deity existing &quot;externally=\r\n&quot; in the macrocosm (universe) is one and the same and there is absolut=\r\nely no difference between all of them! That is essentially the Upanishadic =\r\nunderstanding.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font=\r\n&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;In fact, when you say &q=\r\nuot;inside me&quot;, ask yourself : &quot;what is this I&quot;? Is it the p=\r\nhysical body? Is it the subtle body? Is it the causal body? When mind enter=\r\ntains the notion that it is a physical body, it indeed becomes aware of a p=\r\nhysical body and looks at it as I. When mind entertains the notion that it =\r\nis a subtle body, it indeed becomes aware of a subtle body and looks it as =\r\nI. When mind entertains the notion that it is a causal body, it indeed beco=\r\nmes aware of a causal body and looks it as I. When mind finally overcomes a=\r\nll such notions one after the other, it may look at the supra-cosmic body (=\r\nsupreme cosmic being) as I. According to upanishadic understanding, there i=\r\ns nothing other than Brahman or supreme cosmic being. Thus, expressions lik=\r\ne &quot;inside me&quot;, &quot;inside you&quot; and &quot;inside him&quot; =\r\nare just expressions that describe false notions rather than reality. There=\r\n is no real you, I and he, but there is only a supreme cosmic being.&lt;/font&gt;=\r\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=\r\n=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=\r\n=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2=\r\n&quot;&gt;When you have a conditioned mind, which has a notion that there is a cert=\r\nain entity called &quot;Rajarshi Nandy&quot;, an entity called &quot;Narasi=\r\nmha Rao&quot; etc, these entities exist within your mind, for as long as yo=\r\nur mind=A0can keep those notions alive. When all such false notions are suc=\r\ncessfully eliminated, only=A0supreme cosmic being is left for the mind to f=\r\nocus on.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/fon=\r\nt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;When a conditioned mind that =\r\nhas a notion that it is a specific person called &quot;Rajarshi Nandy&quot;=\r\n in a specific body, such a mind is pre-occupied with so many things that i=\r\nt cannot focus itself on god perfectly. Due to its pre-occupations, it can =\r\nonly focus itself on small aspects of god, in a very limited way. This is l=\r\nike a mirror capturing Sun in a limited way. Sun&#39;s image may be reflect=\r\ned on 100 mirrors in 100 ways. One mirror may be broken and dark colored. I=\r\nt may reflect very little sunlight and sun may appear broken. Like that, ea=\r\nch mind can focus on god in a different way, to a different extent. We expr=\r\ness this fact in alternate words by saying &quot;the mind focuses on intern=\r\nal god and he is limited&quot;.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D=\r\n&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;This is just =\r\na simple way to put things. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;In reali=\r\nty, the issue is not internal vs external. The issue is the mind&#39;s abil=\r\nity to perceive and focus on god. As the mind&#39;s pre-occupation with oth=\r\ner things comes down and its ability to focus on god goes up, we say that t=\r\nhe internal god is becoming stronger. Again, this is just a way of represen=\r\ntation. In reality, god, whether you call him internal or external, is infi=\r\nnite and does not become weaker or stronger. But mind can focus better and =\r\nmind&#39;s idea of god becomes stronger. After all, a dirty mirror reflecti=\r\nng Sun may show a dirty and dull Sun at first and show a cleaner and bright=\r\ner Sun after you clean the mirror. Sun has not really become cleaner or big=\r\nhter. He is the same always. We can say &quot;Sun in the mirror&quot; has b=\r\necome cleaner and brighter. But there is really no Sun &quot;in the&quot; m=\r\nirror! Though we may talk about Sun in mirror 1, Sun in mirror 2, Sun in mi=\r\nrror 3 and the external Sun, they are all one and the same!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; =\r\nface=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;This manner of speaking about internal vs external god and t=\r\nalking about strengthening internal god is used to simplify things. Bottoml=\r\nine is that any visualization of god by a mind is limited by the conditioni=\r\nng, abilities and impurities of that mind. By allowing the mind to visualiz=\r\ne god, to the best of its ability, on a regular basis, we sharpen its abili=\r\nty to visualize god. Eventually, mind loses all other pre-occupations and b=\r\necomes fully absorbed in the infinite god. Then we say that internal god ha=\r\ns become infinite. This is just a manner of speaking.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=\r\n=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=\r\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\n/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;I want to give a sm=\r\nall practical example, that is somewhat relevant and illustrates some conce=\r\npts.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/fo=\r\nnt&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;Once=A0a couple=\r\n of priests with a high spiritual caliber were conducting a Rudraabhishekam=\r\n. They were chanting Sree Rudram 11 times. A person who worships Mahaalaksh=\r\nmi was sitting in a corner of the room. He started to meditate with Savitru=\r\n Gayatri mantra, his favorite mantra. Whichever mantra or deity he worships=\r\n, he always considers everything to be an offering to Mahalakshmi and imagi=\r\nnes only her as receiving the mantra. Here also, he was visualizing Mahalak=\r\nshmi as filling his entire being and was offering Gayatri mantra to her. Af=\r\nter a while, his Kundalini rose and his self-awareness was modified. He los=\r\nt the regular awareness of body, perceived an all-pervading light that he w=\r\nas part of and remained in a nice spiritual state for a while. When he came=\r\n back and the pooja was finished, one of the priests described something un=\r\nusual that he &quot;saw&quot;. In the middle of the pooja, that priest turn=\r\ned towards this person and was surprised by what he saw. He saw a tall=A018=\r\n-handed form of Mahalakshmi standing in=A0the place of this person for a li=\r\nttle while.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;=\r\n&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;As that=\r\n person meditated, his=A0senses turned inward and he was looking internally=\r\n. His mind was focused on Mahaalakshmi, who filled his entire being in his =\r\nvisualization. As Kundalini rose, his distinction of internal and external =\r\nblurred and he perceived himself as *a part* of all-pervading light (it is =\r\nneither &quot;internal&quot; nor &quot;external&quot;). He basically percei=\r\nved Mahaalakshmi as the all-pervading light that he was also a part of. How=\r\never, the priest who happened to look at him at that time was also in a pur=\r\nified state and so he noticed something. His mental conditioning at that ti=\r\nme=A0made him see a specific=A0external form rather than an all-pervading f=\r\norm. But both the priest and the person perceived the same entity in two di=\r\nfferent ways. One was external and limited. The other was neither internal =\r\nnor external (but obtained by looking internally at first) and unlimited. B=\r\nut, both are the same. They appeared different to two minds because of the =\r\nconditioning of those minds rather than anything else, just as the same Sun=\r\n may appear different in two different mirrors!&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;=\r\nfont face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font fac=\r\ne=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;*=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 *=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0=A0 =\r\n*&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;=\r\n&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;&gt;No amount of theor=\r\nization will help one fully understand and appreciate things like this. The=\r\n most important thing is to do some sadhana, such as homam or meditation, o=\r\nn a regular basis. No effort is wasted and eventually gives results when th=\r\nere is critical mass. Whatever I say, whatever masters have said before and=\r\n whatever rishis taught in upanishads, can be understood and appreciated th=\r\nrough direct experience. THAT is the goal of sadhana. Reading scriptures an=\r\nd mails like this is only a starting point. One has to engage in some sadha=\r\nna. Even people like Ramana Maharshi, Ramakrishna Paramahamsa, Trilinga Swa=\r\nmi, Vivekananda etc did sadhana for many years, before they realized god.&lt;/=\r\nfont&gt;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;=A0&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;---------=\r\n---------------------------------------------------------&lt;br&gt;Do a Short Hom=\r\nam Yourself: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/homam&quot; target=\r\n=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/=\r\nhomam&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Do Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/tarpana&quot; target=3D&quot;_=\r\nblank&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org/tarpa=\r\nna&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Spirituality: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a hr=\r\nef=3D&quot;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;font s=\r\nize=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;http://groups.yahoo.com/group/vedic-wisdom&lt;/font&gt;&lt;=\r\n/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Free Jyotish lessons (MP3): &lt;/font&gt;=\r\n&lt;a href=3D&quot;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;font siz=\r\ne=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;http://vedicastro.home.comcast.net&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;fo=\r\nnt size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Free Jyotish software (Windows): &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a hre=\r\nf=3D&quot;http://www.vedicastrologer.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; fa=\r\nce=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;http://www.VedicAstrologer.org&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot;=\r\n face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;Sri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: &lt;/font&gt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;http:=\r\n//www.srijagannath.org/&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;=\r\nhttp://www.SriJagannath.org&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;br&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;-=\r\n----------------------------------------------------------------- &lt;br&gt;\n&lt;/fo=\r\nnt&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;blockquote style=3D&quot;BORDER-LEFT: #000000 2px solid&quot;&gt;\n&lt;div style=\r\n=3D&quot;FONT: 10pt arial&quot;&gt;----- Original Message ----- &lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;table border=3D&quot;=\r\n0&quot; cellspacing=3D&quot;0&quot; cellpadding=3D&quot;0&quot;&gt;\n&lt;tbody&gt;\n&lt;tr&gt;\n&lt;td valign=3D&quot;top&quot;&gt;\n&lt;d=\r\niv&gt;Namaste Narasimha,&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=A0=\r\n&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I little bit of deviation from this topic of this mail.&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;=\r\ndiv&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;There is somethin=\r\ng which I find a little confusion.

Through your mental focus, you are projecting the limited manifestati=\r\non of god inside you into fire and honing your ability to focus the mind on=\r\n that god. I want to clarify one thing here. Though there is actually infin=\r\nite divinity inside you, your pre-occupation with so many other things limi=\r\nts (or zeroes) the divinity that your mind can focus on, access and perceiv=\r\ne. By focusing on it more and more, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to p=\r\nroject it for focusing better.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;/em&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Whe=\r\nn we are doing a homam or any puja, we are trying to create the deity from =\r\nwithin ourselves where it exists. My questions is, is this where all deitie=\r\ns reside(inside)? I mean if I am focusing on Mahaganapati, am I just bringi=\r\nng out the energy of Mahaganapati from inside me or is there one single, un=\r\niversal, omnipotent divinty called Mahaganapati who exists in the universe,=\r\n and I am trying to invite him into the fire?&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; =\r\nface=3D&quot;Arial&quot;&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;I remember a line from Vimalananda whe=\r\nre he says, initially we create the deity in the astral body=A0so that this=\r\n deity (the one we projected)=A0&lt;em&gt;may &lt;/em&gt;lead us to the real deity who =\r\nexists outside in the universe.&lt;/div&gt;\n\n&lt;div&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;2&quot; face=3D&quot;Arial&quot;=\r\n&gt;&lt;/font&gt;=A0&lt;/div&gt;\n&lt;div&gt;Did I understand the procedure correct?

Will you allow someone who=\r\n cooks terribly to cook? Why not allow him to &quot;serve god&quot;?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;b=\r\nr&gt;It is not just about &quot;serving god&quot;, but serving god *well*. A p=\r\nurified servant of god serves god with single-minded focus and devotion and=\r\n has no other thoughts in mind when serving god. A more normal person may t=\r\nhink various things in mind even when serving god. There is some self-cente=\r\nredness and ego even in serving god.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;The god in your homam fire is =\r\nnot an external god, but your own internal god. Through your mental focus, =\r\nyou are projecting the limited manifestation of god inside you into fire an=\r\nd honing your ability to focus the mind on that god. I want to clarify one =\r\nthing here. Though there is actually infinite divinity inside you, your pre=\r\n-occupation with so many other things limits (or zeroes) the divinity that =\r\nyour mind can focus on, access and perceive. By focusing on it more and mor=\r\ne, you grow it. Fire is a good medium to project it for focusing better. On=\r\n practice, the divinity inside you that you can focus on and perceive grows=\r\n with time. Thus, remember that what is in fire is the limited manifestatio=\r\nn of god inside you that you are able to focus, acces and perceive. This li=\r\nmited divinity should be nurtured slowly and allowed to grow, rather than u=\r\nsed up for unnecessary things. When this divinity grows and becomes infinit=\r\ne, all your desires and other thoughts will vanish and you will be able to =\r\nsingle-mindedly focus on that divinity. Some precautions will help you in t=\r\nhe journey.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Karmas and thoughts of people who are making offerings =\r\nin your homam fire are basically being received in your internal god. If he=\r\n has enough power (his power is, after all, the power of *your own* focus!)=\r\n to grant a specific desire of someone, he may just do it. But that makes h=\r\nim weaker and who knows whether the desire was worthwhile?!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Of cour=\r\nse, when you are offering things in fire, you yourself may have some unnece=\r\nssary desires which may slow down the spiritual progress. But, that is a ne=\r\ncessary evil and there is no escape. But, why let someone else&#39;s desire=\r\ns cause an extra slow down?&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Thus, this is not a matter of political=\r\n correctness and being nice.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;However, there is already a lot of karm=\r\nic intermixing between people very closely connected to one karmically, lik=\r\ne wife, children and parents. Wife&#39;s desires may affect husband&#39;s d=\r\nesires and mother&#39;s desires may affect son&#39;s desires already (atlea=\r\nst in a closely bonded and old-fashioned families). So there is no signific=\r\nant drawback to allowing them to share fire.&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Bottomline:&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;If =\r\nsome people are so close to you that you want to allow their karmas and the=\r\nir desires to affect your spiritual progress and slow you down, then allow =\r\nsuch people to offer in your homam fire. Even if you do not allow specifica=\r\nlly, some close people&#39;s karmas and desires may already be directly aff=\r\necting your own karmas and desires and hence slowing you down!&lt;br&gt;\n&lt;br&gt;Usua=\r\nlly, that would be immediate family, but you know your situation better.&lt;br=\r\n&gt;&lt;br&gt;Best regards,&lt;br&gt;Narasimha&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;---- naaraayana_iyer &lt;&lt;a href=3D&quot;=\r\nhttp://in.mc85.mail.yahoo.com/mc/compose?to=3Dnarayan.iyer%40gmail.com&quot; rel=\r\n=3D&quot;nofollow&quot; target=3D&quot;_blank&quot;&gt;narayan.iyer@ gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&gt; wrote: &lt;br&gt;=\r\n\n&gt; Namaste Shri Krishna Kanth,&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; I am sure Narasimha mean=\r\nt outside of your immediate family.

What this namboodi=\r\nri did is the correct way.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; Visualize the externa=\r\nl fire as your internal fire and worship it. Then offerings in it will kind=\r\nle your internal fire and streamline it, depending on how strong your ident=\r\nification is (it will get stronger with practice). If anyone handles that e=\r\nxternal fire or makes offerings in it, some karmas will be submitted by tha=\r\nt person to your internal fire for burning. This intermingling of karmas ca=\r\nn be allowed for people whose karmas are anyway intertwined, like husband a=\r\nnd wife or parents and children. Of course, you can also take on karmas fro=\r\nm the entire world if you are ready and willing to face their consequences,=\r\n but a person with a strong individualized ego should limit the karmas one =\r\nfaces and work on erasing that ego. When one&#39;s ego becomes very subtle,=\r\n it may be possible to take on more karmas and face their consequences. Aft=\r\ner all, if you start plucking leaves, flowers and fruits from a small plant=\r\n, it will die. If you guard it and let it grow very&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; big, it c=\r\nan give flowers and fruits to many more people. So, until you become very p=\r\nure, keep working to burn your karmas and free yourself from the vaasanas (=\r\nmental conditioning) caused by them.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; But some p=\r\neople use fire in the same way an idol is used. They allow anyone to start =\r\nthe fire in their homam, handle the fire and make offerings in it etc. If o=\r\nne who strongly identifies one&#39;s internal fire with external fire does =\r\nsuch things, it can be disastrous. However, luckily, most people who follow=\r\n this approach do not understand much about fire and do not have a strong i=\r\ndentification with the fire. So, fire is practically like an idol for them =\r\nand they do not benefit from fire as much as one can. Thus, allowing everyo=\r\nne to start or handle or making offerings into you fire can be inefficient =\r\nat best and disastrous at worst.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; The best appro=\r\nach is: You start your own fire. Only you handle it. Only you make offering=\r\ns in it. In your mind, identify it with your own internal fire (bhootaagni)=\r\n that burns in the subtle body. If you do this for a while, a strong bond i=\r\ns indeed formed. Without your knowledge, the internal fire will become stro=\r\nng and burn various vaasanas.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (2) There are dif=\r\nferent methods for beeja, shakti and keelakam, though anga nyaasa and kara =\r\nnyaasa are usually standard.. Do not worry about these things and do what y=\r\nou are used to or what you are more attracted to.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &g=\r\nt; As I said many times, these nyaasas are just formality for most people. =\r\nPlacing a letter in a particular body part has a higher significance than j=\r\nust touching a body part and saying the letter. Visualizing a specific body=\r\n part vibrating with a specific sound is possible only after one makes suff=\r\nicient progress in purifying one&#39;s subtle perception. So there is no po=\r\nint in discussing what is essentially a formality. I can tell you that this=\r\n will not block you.&lt;br&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &gt; (3) They should be shown i=\r\nn the video.
