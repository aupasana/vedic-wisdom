We all need to be less \nsens=\r\nitive and more accomodating, this one is for me, be joyful in \npleasure and=\r\n pain or praise and criticism. I am trying now to do this \nand learning to =\r\nbe the best.\n\nPlease you or others don&#39;t shoot miseales at me from whereeve=\r\nr you \nare :-) and please don&#39;t butt me too :-), I have one wife who does i=\r\nt \nfull time and I have no more quota in my karma bank balance to the \nbest=\r\n of my knowledge, ouch it seems now that there may be more ...\n\nI am not go=\r\ning to be defensive but now I shall shed more light on \nthings for the bene=\r\nfit of all.\n\nWhen anyone does more sincere sadhana and is progressing, a st=\r\nate of \njoyfullness engulfs that person internally and externally. He non-\n=\r\nvoluntaryly starts sharing it\n\nI am afriad to state that atleast I fail to =\r\nsee in Narasimha many of \nthe times.\n\nI wanted to influence him indirectly =\r\nabout that and all of us, He and \nall of us need to be more joyful and chee=\r\nrful. Also we do a lot of \nthings mechanically like drinking water, taking =\r\nshower etc. you know \nwhat I mean. So all I was trying to influence indirec=\r\ntly to Narashima \nthat\nfor quoting shastras i.e. where the names are descri=\r\nbed one does not \nneed mother&#39;s direction, it is for the sake of completene=\r\nss and it \nalso helps others  if they want to do more research. One can alw=\r\nays \ndescribe their own experiance or teaching acquired from others.\n\nAs Na=\r\nrasimha states our email exchange was confusing to him first and \nhis respo=\r\nnse to me, am not sure about others or you, more confusion \nto ....\n\nNow I =\r\nhave added even more confusion, but I promise on this subject \nit is the la=\r\nst one from my side.\n\nHave a joyful day.\nBest Regards\nMitesh\n\n--- In vedic-=\r\nwisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;a_k_r_j&quot; &lt;a_k_r_j@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Namaste Mitesh,\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I am sure you are not blaming Narasimha but your way of expression \n&gt; =\r\nclearly shows that you are not familiar with his writings.

When I look at the developmen=\r\nt and \n&gt; transformation that he has gone through in this period, it amazes =\r\n\nme \n&gt; to no end. Initially he was (of course still is) a scholar of Vedic =\r\n\n&gt; astrology and later is developing in to a spiritual giant. In all \n&gt; the=\r\nse years, he has unselfishly contributed to whatever he takes up \n&gt; and mad=\r\ne it a point to spread the knowledge all around for the \n&gt; benefit of the h=\r\numanity in general. \n&gt; \n&gt; I know Narasimha will not appreciate this mail as=\r\n it contains no \n&gt; valuable information for the seekers and it might sound =\r\nas though I \n&gt; am praising him. My intention is not that, for I believe he =\r\nhas \nrisen \n&gt; above accolade. \n&gt; \n&gt; You can certainly make requests or even=\r\n oppose/question his \nwritings \n&gt; and can extend other opinions that you ma=\r\ny have, in a way that will \n&gt; not offend the members of the group. Particul=\r\narly the paragraph &quot;We \n&gt; eat=85&quot; is not at all in good taste, although Utp=\r\nal has taken them as \n&gt; hilarious comments, which shows his magnanimity. It=\r\n clearly shows \n&gt; your lack of understanding of the context and level of Na=\r\nrasimha&#39;s \n&gt; spiritual attainments.\n&gt; \n&gt; I have never written in support of=\r\n anyone so far nor do I have the \n&gt; habit of participating in the discussio=\r\nns on the various groups. I \n&gt; have been a silent member, as many are, read=\r\ning the wonderful \n&gt; writings of people like Narasimha and trying to learn =\r\nfrom them.\n&gt; \n&gt; I hope I have not offended you with my comments, I just fel=\r\nt like \n&gt; butting in!

Spirit \nof\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; determination and strength controls how you absorb your \n&gt; &gt; &gt; experienc=\r\nes,\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; when you are offering in that tongue of fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sudhoomra-Varna is the greyish/purple/ smoke-colored fire. \n&gt; &gt; Spir=\r\nit \n&gt; &gt; &gt; of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; confusion (could also be resolution of confusion) co=\r\nntrols \n&gt; how \n&gt; &gt; you\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; absorb your experiences, when you are offe=\r\nring in that \ntongue \n&gt; &gt; of \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fire.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sphulingini=\r\n is the fire with sparks. Spirit of aggression \n&gt; and \n&gt; &gt; &gt; haste\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; (could also be a great intuition/insight) controls how you \n&gt; &gt; absorb\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; your experiences, when you are offering in that tongue of \n&gt; fire.\n=\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Vishwaruchi is the bright fire. Spirit of focus, know=\r\ning, \n&gt; &gt; being \n&gt; &gt; &gt; and\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; bliss controls how you absorb your exp=\r\neriences, when you \nare \n&gt; &gt; &gt; offering\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; in that tongue of fire.\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; As you keep performing hom=\r\nam and a relationship is formed \n&gt; &gt; between\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; you and fire, the ex=\r\nternal fire in the homa kundam will \n&gt; reflect \n&gt; &gt; &gt; your\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; intern=\r\nal fire. When your mind is well-focused and blissful, \n&gt; the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; fire\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will automatically burn bright.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The state of =\r\nyour mind will decide how you will taste the \n&gt; &gt; &gt; spiritual\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; exp=\r\neriences you are going to absorb from around you. That \nin \n&gt; &gt; turn\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; decides which tongues (tasting agents) of your internal \nfire \n&gt; are\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; receiving food right now. That in turn decides which \ntongues \n&gt; of=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; external fire are receiving offerings right now.\n&gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; The external fire is a mirror to your internal state. An =\r\n\n&gt; adept \n&gt; &gt; &gt; may\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; be able to detect, looking at the fire, which=\r\n tongues of \nfire \n&gt; &gt; are\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; active right now and hence guess the s=\r\ntate your mind is in.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; * * *\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Of =\r\ncourse, trying to pay too much attention to this \n&gt; &gt; technicality\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; and becoming over-conscious of the nature of fire is \n&gt; unneeded. \n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\nThough\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; external can be used to manipulate the internal (within \ns=\r\nome \n&gt; &gt; &gt; limits),\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; it can become a distraction.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; Whether internal follows external or external follows \n&gt; internal \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; a\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; invalid question. The reality is that the two change \ntogethe=\r\nr.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Neither is the cause and neither is the effect. They just \n&gt; h=\r\nappen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; together.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Without thinkiing much, jus=\r\nt make offerings in the fire \nwith \n&gt; &gt; the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; *firm belief* that go=\r\nd is in fire. The rest will happen\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; automatically. It may take tim=\r\ne, but it will happen by \nitself.\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Best regards,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt;&gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- -----=\r\n---- ------\n--\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt;  -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do a Short Homam Yourself: htt=\r\np://www.VedicAst \nrologer.org/ \n&gt; &gt; homam\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Do Pitri Tarpanas Your=\r\nself: \n&gt; &gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAst rologer.org/ tarpana\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Spirituali=\r\nty: http://groups. yahoo.com/ group/vedic- wisdom\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jyotish l=\r\nessons (MP3): http://vedicastro. \nhome.comcast. \n&gt; &gt; net\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Free Jy=\r\notish software (Windows): http://www.VedicAst \n&gt; &gt; rologer.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; S=\r\nri Jagannath Centre (SJC) website: http://www.SriJagan \n&gt; &gt; nath.org\n&gt; &gt; &gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt;&gt; ------------ --------- --------- --------- --------- ------\n--\n&gt; -\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n  -\n&gt; &gt; &gt; - \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; ----- Original Message ----- \n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n From: &quot;rajarshi14&quot; &lt;rajarshi14@ &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; To: &lt;vedic-wisdom@ yahoogroup=\r\ns. com&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Sent: Wednesday, February 11, 2009 8:13 AM\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; Su=\r\nbject: [vedic-wisdom] Agni\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Namaste\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; What do the seven &quot;tongues&quot; of Agni mean?\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt;=\r\n &gt; -Regards\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;&gt; &gt; Rajarshi\n&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; &gt;       Add more friends to your messenger and enjoy!
