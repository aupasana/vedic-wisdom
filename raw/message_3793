The idea is that one is not=\r\n bound by Maayaa once one *fully* understands and appreciates it.\n=C2=A0\nCh=\r\nandipath consists of symbolic stories of wars that the divine Mother fought=\r\n, which explain how one can fight and overcome various weaknesses that typi=\r\ncally bind one in Maayaa. Reciting these stories on a regular basis will pr=\r\nomote the fighting spirit within one that fights these weaknesses.\n=C2=A0\nT=\r\nhere is nothing wrong in understanding Maayaa and trying to fight/overcome =\r\nit at the same time. One aspect of the Mother creates Maayaa. One aspect of=\r\n the Mother makes you experience good and bad in that Maayaa. One aspect of=\r\n the Mother makes you understand Maayaa to overcome it. One aspect of the M=\r\nother makes you fight and overcome it. When one realizes Self at the end, i=\r\nrrespective of the path taken, one finally sees that all these are aspects =\r\nof a Single Mother who is also essentially true Self.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 =\r\n*\n=C2=A0\n&gt; Also, I have started to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robe=\r\nrt\n&gt; Svobodha. For now I have very mixed feelings on the subject.\n&gt; Perhaps=\r\n I need to read more! \n=C2=A0\nAghora series books by Svoboda are good, but =\r\nAghora is not everyone&#39;s cup of tea. It is normal to have mixed feelings.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nGhora means terrible. Aghora means &quot;not terrible&quot;. One of the names =\r\nof Lord Shiva is Aghora. A true=C2=A0Aghora (aghori) does not see anything =\r\nas terrible or bad or impure and sees all as impermanent manifestations of =\r\ngod and tries to focus the thinking of the mind on what is permanent (god) =\r\nalways, instead of impermanent manifestations of god.\n=C2=A0\nWhen someone d=\r\nies, north Indians chant &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; while carrying the dead bod=\r\ny to the funeral. It means &quot;only the name of Lord Rama is true and everythi=\r\nng else is an illusion&quot;. The idea is to remind oneself that life and death =\r\nare just a temporary illusion and only the Lord is real. But the question i=\r\ns: why should we remind ourselves of this ultimate truth only when someone =\r\ndies? When someone praises us for a supposedly great thing we have done and=\r\n we are about to feel proud and happy, can&#39;t we tell ourselves &quot;Raama naam =\r\nsatya hai. This thing we did and the praises are temporary illusions. Only =\r\nthe Lord is real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;? When we f=\r\neel attracted to something beautiful and want to get it, can&#39;t we tell ours=\r\nelves &quot;Raama naam satya hai. This thing that seems beautiful and other thin=\r\ngs that seem not so beautiful are temporary illusions. Only the Lord is rea=\r\nl. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?\n When someone attacks an=\r\nd abuses us and we are about to feel sad or angry, can&#39;t we tell ourselves =\r\n&quot;Raama naam satya hai. These abuses are temporary illusions. Only the Lord =\r\nis real. Let the mind not dwell on temporary illusions&quot;?&quot;\n=C2=A0\nA true Agh=\r\nora&#39;s mind thinks &quot;Raama naam satya hai&quot; always. His mind rejects all *impe=\r\nrmanent manifestations* of Lord (instead of *dwelling* on them by classifyi=\r\nng them as pure and impure, good and bad etc and thinking about them with a=\r\nttraction/aversion ) and tries to find and focus on what is permanent. But =\r\nhe takes it to extremes.\n=C2=A0\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=\r\n *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nVedanta says &quot;all is =\r\nSelf. The variety we perceive is an illusion&quot;. An aghora pursues it practic=\r\nally. If feces and fruit are both impermenant illusions and the only perman=\r\nent reality within them is the Self, he questions why he can eat fruit but =\r\nnot feces. So he may try a ritual where feces is eaten.=C2=A0But, please re=\r\nmember that eating feces is not the main point. Perceiving Self in the food=\r\n being consumed and not perceiving an impermanent manifestation of Self (fe=\r\nces, fruit etc), is the main point. For example, eating feces with disgust =\r\nserves no purpose, for such a person&#39;s mind is dwelling on the impermenant =\r\nmanifestation of Self (&quot;feces&quot;) while eating it. A successful Aghora may be=\r\n eating feces, but the mind will not be dwelling on the fact that he is eat=\r\ning &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties and will not feel any kind of disgust. =\r\nHe will be thinking that he is Self and he is eating Self.\n=C2=A0\nOf course=\r\n, a vedantin also has the same notions really. He chants vedic verses when =\r\neating food, which essentially mean &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot;. Ne=\r\nvertheless, such chanting may merely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed =\r\nin one&#39;s thinking. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant manife=\r\nstations of Self (&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overl=\r\ny salty cracker&quot; etc) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Self).\n=C2=\r\n=A0\nThus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth an=\r\nd trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse. But aghora is=\r\n putting himself in an extreme situation where failure results in a very ba=\r\nd dual experience. That can in fact work as an incentive in forcing one to =\r\ntranscend duality! In the case of a person who chants a Vedic verse that sa=\r\nys &quot;I am Self and I am consuming Self&quot; and eats tasty laddus and nicely mad=\r\ne food, the fallout from failing to absorb the mind in Self while eating is=\r\n not too bad. If the mind dwells on the nice (or even not-so-nice) taste of=\r\n a laddu or other food, what is the big deal? On the other hand, if the min=\r\nd fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so d=\r\nisgusting. Thus, the fact that failure results in a very bad dual experienc=\r\ne may act as an incentive in succeeding quickly.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, difficult =\r\ntasks cannot necessarily be accomplished by everyone merely because of an i=\r\nncentive. Not everyone trying Aghora sadhanas succeeds.\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0 *\n=C2=A0\nTake another simple example. Suppose someone is doing a lot of=\r\n sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakness for sex. Suppose =\r\none&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thoughts in the middle of s=\r\nadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sadhana.\n=C2=A0\nA regul=\r\nar person will try to enforce celibacy and keep the mind away from sexual t=\r\nhoughts. But that is nor a formula for overcoming such thoughts. After all,=\r\n such thoughts may still come and distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy =\r\nfor 10 years, there is no guarantee that the fascination in the mind does n=\r\not return to bite one after that. But, how to overcome the fascination some=\r\n minds may have for sex?\n=C2=A0\nAn aghora will take it to an extreme. He wi=\r\nll try to fix the root cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead =\r\nof keeping sadhana and sex as two different activities (one pure and the ot=\r\nher impure), he may combine them into one without such distinctions of pure=\r\n vs impure. Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on =\r\nhis lap and then does his japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and r=\r\nesult in sex. He may think that his sadhana is being made impure. But, supp=\r\nose he persists to do japam like that for several months/years. Eventually,=\r\n mind may be reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something=\r\n impure. He may no longer feel titillation. The association in his mind bet=\r\nween nakedness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically=\r\n or mentally may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of med=\r\nitation. Any small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head m=\r\nay not lead to denser and\n denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction =\r\nin sadhana, but they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spendi=\r\nng so much time in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attractio=\r\nn and thrill mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Ov=\r\nerall, the person&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.\n=\r\n=C2=A0\nMind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences and the th=\r\noughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down some of thes=\r\ne structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine those structur=\r\nes.\n=C2=A0\nHowever, is this a fool-proof method? Not really. It is also pos=\r\nsible that the person keeps on engaging in the practice merely for sex and =\r\nthinks of sex everytime he sits for meditation (instead of thinking of medi=\r\ntation everytime he sees naked partner), if one was not serious/sincere/ re=\r\nady to start with.\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0Bottomline is that an aghor=\r\na takes problems and weaknesses head on and sets up a high stakes fight wit=\r\nh them, whereas a normal person may push the problems under the carpet and =\r\nfight slowly and with low stakes. Such a risky strategy is not applicable t=\r\no all.\n=C2=A0\n\n*=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=\r\n=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0=C2=A0 *\n=C2=A0Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;wh=\r\nat is Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to unde=\r\nrstand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high st=\r\nakes war plan.

In general, it=\r\n is a good idea to pick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on =\r\nthem, instead of splitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Para=\r\nmahamsa said, it is better to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig on=\r\ne metre in ten places, if one wants to find water.\n\nOne possibility is to d=\r\no a homam and then meditate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantr=\r\nas one is attached to.\n\nI am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya.

Its purpose, too, is to =\r\nunravel the layer of duality and realize Self.\n\nLalita means gentle one and=\r\n Chandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teaches you gently, =\r\nyou will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern and strict, you wi=\r\nll learn fast (provided you can face the strictness).

If your partner is willing, use Shiva lata and do =\r\nnot be disheartened by failure initially. As time goes on, the&nbsp;thing i=\r\nn your mind which thinks of sex is incinerated and slowly you find that a n=\r\naked female(or male as&nbsp;may be the case)&nbsp;body is like a landscape =\r\npicture just like any other picture made by Her of nature(like Niagara fall=\r\ns, or Angkor Wat, you need not be disturbed by it, you can certainly&nbsp;f=\r\neel that the picture&nbsp;is very beautiful&nbsp;but you need not be arouse=\r\nd by it). In fact Striya Samasta Sakala jagatsu, tyaikiya.... ...&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DI=\r\nV&gt;Once this stage is reached then the mind ceases to think of sex all the w=\r\nhile.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Yes you may still encounter it, but that is another story.=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dim&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT style=3D&quot;BACKGRO=\r\nUND-COLOR: #ffff66&quot; face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;=\r\nDIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Manish&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV class=3Dgmail_quote&gt;On Thu, Feb 25, 2010 at 2:24 PM, Narasimha P.V=\r\n.R.

A successful Aghora may be eating feces, but the mind will no=\r\nt be dwelling on the fact that he is eating &quot;feces&quot; with certain properties=\r\n and will not feel any kind of disgust.

Nevertheless, such =\r\nchanting may merely be a ritual and not be fully absorbed in one&#39;s thinking=\r\n. As he eats, his mind may dwell on the impermanant manifestations of Self =\r\n(&quot;a tasty laddu&quot;, &quot;a badly cooked brinjal curry&quot;, &quot;a overly salty cracker&quot; =\r\netc) and waver from the focus on the permanent (Self).&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;F=\r\nONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=\r\n=3D2&gt;Thus, a vedantin and an aghora are telling themselves the same truth a=\r\nnd trying to absorb that truth into every thought and impulse.

On the other hand, if the mi=\r\nnd fails to absorb in Self and dwells on the taste of feces, it will be so =\r\ndisgusting.

Suppose someo=\r\nne is doing a lot of sadhana, like japam and homam, and yet having a weakne=\r\nss for sex. Suppose one&#39;s mind is dwelling on sex or getting sexual thought=\r\ns in the middle of sadhana and that is causing guilt and blocking one&#39;s sad=\r\nhana.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;A regular person will try to enforce cel=\r\nibacy and keep the mind away from sexual thoughts. But that is nor a formul=\r\na for overcoming such thoughts. After all, such thoughts may still come and=\r\n distract one. Even if one keeps celibacy for 10 years, there is no guarant=\r\nee that the fascination in the mind does not return to bite one after that.=\r\n But, how to overcome the fascination some minds may have for sex?&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;D=\r\nIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;An aghora will take it to an extreme. He will try to f=\r\nix the root cause and remove fascination from the mind. Instead of keeping =\r\nsadhana and sex as two different activities (one pure and the other impure)=\r\n, he may combine them into one without such distinctions of pure vs impure.=\r\n Suppose an aghora sits naked with his partner sitting naked on his lap and=\r\n then does his japam. In the beginning, this may titillate and result in se=\r\nx. He may think that his sadhana is being made impure. But, suppose he pers=\r\nists to do japam like that for several months/years. Eventually, mind may b=\r\ne reprogrammed. He may no longer feel that he is doing something impure. He=\r\n may no longer feel titillation. The association in his mind between nakedn=\r\ness and sex may be broken down. Seeing naked pictures physically or mentall=\r\ny may no longer evoke thoughts of sex, but evoke thoughts of meditation. An=\r\ny small thoughts related to sex that suddenly rise in the head may not lead=\r\n to\n denser and denser thoughts relating to sex and distraction in sadhana,=\r\n but they may now take the mind back to meditation. After spending so much =\r\ntime in meditation while sitting naked intimately, the attraction and thril=\r\nl mind may feel for nakedness or intimacy may be broken down. Overall, the =\r\nperson&#39;s fascination and weakness for sex may be gone largely.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&=\r\nnbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Mind has a lot of conditioning based on prior experiences =\r\nand the thoughts we are exposed to. Aghora sometimes tries to break down so=\r\nme of these structures by engaging in certain practices that undermine thos=\r\ne structures.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;However, is this a fool-proof me=\r\nthod? Not really. It is also possible that the person keeps on engaging in =\r\nthe practice merely for sex and thinks of sex everytime he sits for meditat=\r\nion (instead of thinking of meditation everytime he sees naked partner), if=\r\n one was not serious/sincere/ ready to start with.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n=\r\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=\r\n;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nb=\r\nsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;Bottomline is that an aghora takes problems and weaknesses head on=\r\n and sets up a high stakes fight with them, whereas a normal person may pus=\r\nh the problems under the carpet and fight slowly and with low stakes. Such =\r\na risky strategy is not applicable to all.&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial si=\r\nze=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial size=3D2&gt;*&nbsp;&n=\r\nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; *&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nb=\r\nsp; *&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;Like Manish said in a mail earlier, &quot;wh=\r\nat is Vedanta and what is Aghora&quot;? Aghora is merely a practical way to unde=\r\nrstand and absorb Vedanta in one&#39;s thought process, by setting up a high st=\r\nakes war plan. However, it is certainly not suitable for all and many may f=\r\neel aversion. More dangerously, some people may feel attraction for it base=\r\nd on a wrong understanding and the thrill such an understanding brings.&nbs=\r\np;Aghora stands for neither thrills nor perversion, though it *may* attract=\r\n some people pursuing thrills and/or perversion. The basic tenets of Aghora=\r\n and Vedanta/Upanishads are the same, but Aghora tries to accelerates how o=\r\nne absorbs the truth into one&#39;s thinking by making failure very unpleasant.=\r\n&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;BTW, the following mail gives a good analogy =\r\nfor various spiritual paths and explains the basic reality.

For&nbsp;instance, Sri Muththusw=\r\namy Diskshitar, was a great composer (one of the Divine Trinity of Carnatic=\r\n Music along with Thyagaraja and Shyama Sastry), who was a self-realized Sr=\r\ni Vidyopasaka. His Kamalamba Navavarna Krithis&nbsp;mention&nbsp;great deta=\r\nils about all the&nbsp;nine avaranas and different forms of the divine moth=\r\ner as one goes through each avarana.&nbsp;In the Dhyana Krithi&nbsp;of thos=\r\ne, in the very&nbsp;first line he says, &#39;Kamalambike, AsRta kalpalatike, Ch=\r\nanDike&#39;.&nbsp;That line tells me that&nbsp;even through Sri Vidya one can w=\r\norship Chandi Ma, in that form.&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;So my question was in that perspective. Anyway, your repl=\r\ny was a great one in which you mentioned how the Self is surrounded by laye=\r\nrs of duality! I never thought in those terms. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DAri=\r\nal&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;I have started reading Durga Saptashati, just t=\r\no get practise of reading it fluently, before I start to do chandi homam, w=\r\nhich I plan to do during navaratri of 2010. I really cannot wait to get com=\r\nfortable reading the saptashati! Have to see how mother will help me achiev=\r\ne my target. &lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT face=3DArial&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;Also, =\r\nI have started to read the Aghora series books by Dr. Robert Svobodha.

My performing a Chandi homam everyday should hardly be awe-inspirin=\r\ng. On the other hand, there are some people who do not know Sanskrit at all=\r\n and took 4 hours to read Chandipath with great difficulty in their first a=\r\nttempt. THEY are doing Chandi homam everyday and it takes them 1.5 hours no=\r\nw. THAT is awe-inspiring.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Integrating various sadhanas is a personal=\r\n problem that needs a personal solution. In general, it is a good idea to p=\r\nick one or two sadhanas and maximize the time spent on them, instead of spl=\r\nitting the time between ten things. As Ramakrishna Paramahamsa said, it is =\r\nbetter to dig 10 metres in one place rather than dig one metre in ten place=\r\ns, if one wants to find water.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;One possibility is to do a homam and =\r\nthen meditate at the end after poornaahuti with various mantras one is atta=\r\nched to.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;I am not that knowledgeable about Sri Vidya. However, from =\r\nthe\n little I have been exposed to, Sree chakra is a symblic representation=\r\n of the layers of duality surrounding Self. Its purpose, too, is to unravel=\r\n the layer of duality and realize Self.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Lalita means gentle one and =\r\nChandi means the fierce one. If you have a mother who teaches you gently, y=\r\nou will learn slowly. If you have a mother who is stern and strict, you wil=\r\nl learn fast (provided you can face the strictness).

You also wr=\r\note that it takes about 1.25 hours to 1.5 hours to do your chandi homam. Ho=\r\nw can you accomplish that feat with 700 ahutis in such a short time? Also, =\r\nin my case, I do sandhyavandanam with 108 Gayatri (20 minutes)+ganapathi ma=\r\nntra japam 108 times(10 minutes), a short rudra Abhishekam with pachakshari=\r\n, a deeparadhana etc. (5-10 minutes) totalling to about 35 - 40 minutes dai=\r\nly ritual. Plus I sometimes do special rituals several times a week, that t=\r\nakes about 1 to 1.5 hours in all. How to integrate these along with homam? =\r\nIs Sri vidyopasana different from Chandi homam? Could you please explain wh=\r\nat is sri Vidya\n and how it is to be learnt? I am very motivated to learn w=\r\nhat the Devi Mahatmayam is all about but I also have keen interest in Sri V=\r\nidya, because I am a musician also and learnt all the nava-avarna krithis o=\r\nf Great Muththuswami Dikshitar recently.&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;Nagraj Kota&lt;BR&gt;&lt;BR&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/=\r\nDIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;&lt;/TBODY&gt;&lt;/TABLE&gt;.&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;=\r\n/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;/D=\r\nIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;BR&gt;\n&lt;DIV&gt;&lt;FONT =\r\nface=3DArial size=3D2&gt;&lt;/FONT&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/DIV&gt;&lt;/BLOCKQUOTE&gt;&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;&lt;/tab=\r\nle&gt;\r\n--0-2124630011-1267154929=:16637--\r\n\n"}}
