I \nwanted to make a few points to close off this discus=\r\nsion (specifically  science \nrelated issues). If you would like to continue=\r\n these discussions privately, I \nwould be happy to do so!\n\n&quot;That is because=\r\n Wikipedia is not a scientific journal&quot;\n\nWe can have a discussion about a s=\r\nubject without deriding the source of \npublication. I first learned about B=\r\nV, bioavailability, human nutrition etc. in \nthe pre-internet era. Giving y=\r\nou a list of my textbooks, courses and lectures is \nnot going to be helpful=\r\n for discussion. Besides when we are having a public \ndiscussion, it is bes=\r\nt to give others a reference about where you are coming \nfrom.\n\nAlso, what =\r\nis so sacrosanct about scientific journal articles? Check out this \nrecent =\r\narticle about fraud in scientific journal publications.\n\nhttp://www.ncbi.nl=\r\nm.nih.gov/pubmed/21081306\n\nI have the entire article and will be happy to s=\r\nhare if you would like to read \nit.\nNow coming specifically to the  wikiped=\r\nia article, there are no erroneous or \nfalse statements  in it. If there ar=\r\ne let me know and we can discuss.\n\n&quot;Now some references from scientific pap=\r\ners on why a  vegeterian/vegan (a vegan \ndoes not use milk or ghee or any a=\r\nnimal  product at all) diet often ends up \nbecoming nutrient deficient&quot;\n\nYo=\r\nu seem to be conflating  protein deficiency with nutrient deficiency.  Ther=\r\ne \nare related terms not equivalent terms, proteins are only one subset of =\r\nvarious \nnutrients that the body requires. Also, being a vegetarian and veg=\r\nan are two \ndifferent issues. This thread is specifically about vegetariani=\r\nsm (lacto \nvegetarianism, more specifically)\n\nCiting an abstract of a paper=\r\n is not helpful for discussion. There are plenty of \nfree, credible resourc=\r\nes available on the internet these days. If you (or anyone \nelse) would lik=\r\ne to read, here is a nice lecture series on the physiology human \nnutrition=\r\n.\n\nhttp://www.cellinteractive.com/ucla/nutrition_101/phys_index.html\n\nHuman=\r\n nutrition is too complicated a subject to be dealt in a internet  \ndiscuss=\r\nion group like this....too many variables to sort out..a couple of nice \nar=\r\nticles on the interaction between different foods and factors that can \naff=\r\nection bioavailability \n\n\nhttp://www.eufic.org/article/en/artid/Nutrient-bi=\r\noavailability-food/\n\nhttp://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/4777607.stm\n\n&quot;Vitamin B12 f=\r\nor example is most easily fond in animal  carriers (it is a \nbacteria which=\r\n uses an animal carrier) to enter and  assimilate into the human \nbody&quot;\n\nTh=\r\nis is a inaccurate statement, both scientifically and grammatically, if I m=\r\nay \nadd!\n\nHere is a good write up on Vitamin B-12 deficiency.\n\nhttp://www.a=\r\nafp.org/afp/2003/0301/p979.html\n\n&quot;The problem is, as I mentioned, most vege=\r\nterians are  unaware of the right \nfood,\n\nThat is true for most people, veg=\r\netarian and non vegetarians alike!\n\n&quot;.. and further, in a coutry like India=\r\n, the poor  can never afford the \nvegeterian substitutes of non vegeterian =\r\nnutrient  sources.&quot;\n\nYou need substitutes only if you are lacking in a bala=\r\nnced diet in the first \nplace! Lack of a balanced nutritious diet in India =\r\nis because of socio-economic \nfactors, not because of any inherent deficien=\r\ncies in a vegetarian diet itself. \nThis is a combination of the protein-ene=\r\nrgy malnutrition and micronutrient \ndeficiencies. For a comprehensive repor=\r\nt, please read this report (or at least \nthe executive summary!).\n\nhttp://g=\r\no.worldbank.org/TUTLNHSPH0\n\n&quot;So scientifically, a totally vegeterian diet i=\r\ns often an unbalanced diet...&quot;\n\nReally! Making such a disingenuous statemen=\r\nt invalidates your whole argument \nabout the scientific rigor that you clai=\r\nm to have... Any diet can be \nbalanced....it depends on a whole lot of fact=\r\nors....\n\n&quot;...This is a very complex  area of discussion and may require tim=\r\ne and energy, \nand most  importantly, removal of preconceptions from the mi=\r\nnd that is  acquired \nthrough birth and cultural conditionings.&quot;\n\nWe all ha=\r\nve our preconceptions based on our backgrounds and experiences...in \nanothe=\r\nr e-mail to Narasimha, you wrote about homosexuality being a reversible \nco=\r\nndition...well, let me break this to you , both the American Psychiatric \nA=\r\nssociation and the American Psychological Association have removed it from =\r\nthe \nlist of mental conditions since the past 35 years! Unless you think yo=\r\nu know \nbetter than them, you might want to change your opinion....\n\nhttp:/=\r\n/www.apa.org/helpcenter/sexual-orientation.aspx\n\nGiven that we all have a l=\r\not to learn it is best to be respectful of others who \nmay have a different=\r\n perspective and at least giving someone the benefit of \ndoubt, before maki=\r\nng any judgments. For some reason, the use of the word, \n&quot;scientific&quot; touch=\r\ned a raw nerve in you and the rest is for everyone to see....\n\nwarm regards=\r\n,\nChandraprakash.\n\n\n\n\n________________________________\nFrom: rajarshi nandy=\r\n &lt;rajarshi14@...&gt;\nTo: vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\nSent: Wed, Decem=\r\nber 1, 2010 3:11:41 PM\nSubject: Re: [vedic-wisdom] Re: IS NON VEG FOOD BAD =\r\nFOR MEN?

The estimated precursor-product ratio was greater in women than in men \n=\r\nand greater in non-fish-eaters than in fish-eaters. &quot;\n \nEtc. etc.\n \nNow com=\r\ning to the following parts of your mail.\n \n \nMore specifically, BV talks ab=\r\nout protein assimilation exclusively and there are \nquite a few flaws even =\r\nestimating that. \n\n \nThe &#39;flaws&#39; it speaks about pertain to differences in =\r\nmethods of calculations.  \nInstead of BV, some researches use PCA, PCAAS. e=\r\ntc or PRF. But none of them \ndispute the basic findings of which is the eas=\r\niest source of proteins.\n \nThere are two factors crucial in any nutritional=\r\n study. Assimilation of the \nnutrient into the bodymass (like BV calc) and =\r\nease of bio-availability. Vitamin \nB12 for example is most easily fond in a=\r\nnimal carriers (it is a bacteria which \nuses an animal carrier) to enter an=\r\nd assimilate into the human body. This can \nalso be taken in from milk and =\r\nsoya flakes spread. But, ease of availaility \ndescreases and finally a doct=\r\nor recommends taking Vitamin B12 suppliments - \nspecially for women during =\r\npregnancy - whose natural diet did not include the \nsame. Also our body bei=\r\nng an organic matter and the supplements being mostly \ninorganic, the assim=\r\nilation always happens less than ideal.\n \nStrictly from a scientific point =\r\nof view, I have hardly seen any vegeterians \nbeing aware of the subtitutes =\r\nto be taken which can provide the same nutrients \nthat a fish/meat/egg can =\r\nprovide, not to mention the fact that the substitutes \nare far more costly =\r\nand often unafforable for those who are not economically \nwell off, special=\r\nly in a country like India. \n\n \nThe points you have jotted down also state =\r\nthe same thing and thus validate what \nI have stated.\n \nFor the vast majori=\r\nty of the population living a fairly active lifestyle and \naccess to suffic=\r\nient vegetarian food, adequate protein intake is not an issue at \nall. \n\n \n=\r\nThe problem is, as I mentioned, most vegeterians are unaware of the right f=\r\nood, \nand further, in a coutry like India, the poor can never afford the ve=\r\ngeterian \nsubstitutes of non vegeterian nutrient sources.\n \nHow many vegete=\r\nrians in India actually go to a dietetics, or even a doctor to \nfigure out =\r\nthe correct diet, even though an average doctor has really very \nlittle kno=\r\nwledge of nutrition (which is because nutrition is merely a two weeks \ncour=\r\nse in a 4 years study). If one has to learn about nutrition, search for an =\r\n\nMD in Nutrition and Clinical Dietetics!\n \nSo scientifically, a totally veg=\r\neterian diet is often an unbalanced diet - for \nthe reasons mentioned above=\r\n, and this haas been shown through many tests on \nvegeterians and omnivores=\r\n - just like american/european extreme of meat based \ndiets, which are very=\r\n unbalanced too. \n \n___________\n \n \nDr Atul mentioned that if by some mirac=\r\nle the whole world population were to be \nconverted to vegeterians, a proti=\r\nen crisis of unheard proportions leading to \nriots would happen. In my anal=\r\nysis, it in an understatement.  To analyse and \nappreciate the whole impact=\r\n of suc a shift one must spend time to study and \nunderstand the economic, =\r\nevolutionary and geological crisis that would ensue. \nFor this the study ha=\r\ns to start from why and when animal protein intake became a \npart of human =\r\ndiet, for which why certain species of animals were domesticated \nand breed=\r\n which would not have survived this long had it not been for human \ninterve=\r\nntion (just like our rice/wheat too would not have survived had it not \nbee=\r\nn for human intervention, in natural proccess of evolution).

Human body i=\r\ns naturally suited for an omnivorous diet. Just like \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; people do not e=\r\nat raw meat, normally, people do not eat raw vegetables as well. \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; Coo=\r\nking is a later addition to human society. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; If you were to clear=\r\n your mind of all preconcieved ideas and look at REAL \n&gt;&gt; research in the m=\r\nost unbiased way possible, and accessed scientific papers in \n\n&gt;&gt; clinical =\r\nnutrition and dietetics, as latest as 2010 june/july, you would find \n\n&gt;&gt; a=\r\nmple evidence that humans as a speicies, for many milleniums have relied on=\r\n an \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; omnivorous diet:-\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; a) Human  ancestral diets changed subst=\r\nantially approximately four to five \n&gt;&gt; million years ago with major climat=\r\nic changes creating open grassland \n&gt;&gt; environments. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; b) Humans =\r\ndeveloped a larger brain balanced by a smaller, simpler \n&gt;&gt; gastrointestina=\r\nl tract=C3=82  requiring=C3=82 foods based around meat protein and fat. \n&gt;&gt;=\r\nFor \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; example since the time of Australopithecus afarensis, some four =\r\nto five million \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; years ago, brain size has increased threefold - chem=\r\nical requirement for \n&gt;&gt; long-chain polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in th=\r\ne brain - without a \n&gt;&gt; corresponding increase in the Basal Metabolic Rate.=\r\n This is possible only with \n&gt;&gt;a \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; diet that is rich is animal protein=\r\n. Simply put, in layman terms, our brain \n&gt;&gt; would not have reached the siz=\r\ne and mass as it is today, had it not been for \n&gt;&gt; diet comprising of meat,=\r\n fruits and vegetables. \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; c) The gut  morphology of the human bod=\r\ny as it stand todays is ideally \n&gt;&gt; equidistant from that of carnivores as =\r\nwell as herbivores. That is because \n&gt;&gt; humans are designed to be omnivores=\r\n. The lack of a well developed caecum and \n&gt;&gt; rumen, unlike herbivores, mak=\r\nes it difficult for the body to absorve plant \n&gt;&gt; cellulose into usable ene=\r\nrgy, which is why, a=C3=82 major part of the leafy \n&gt;&gt;vegetable \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; base=\r\nd diet eventually ends up as roughage. On the other hand, the stomach \n&gt;&gt;li=\r\nning \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; of humans do not contain=C3=82  the kind of strong acids which =\r\nis present in a \n&gt;&gt;typical \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; carnivore. This is because, humans, diet =\r\nas set by Nature through=C3=82  the natural \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; process of evolution is =\r\nsupposed to be omnivorous. It may further interest you \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; to know that t=\r\nhe teeth structure of humans is actually identical to, guess \n&gt;&gt;what, \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;=\r\n&gt; rats who also are omnivores.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; d) It may shock many a preconcieved a=\r\nnd  mistaken ideas that=C3=82 research into \n&gt;&gt; clinical nutrition very cle=\r\narly indicates that absorption ability of the human \n&gt;\n&gt;&gt; body for=C3=82 w.=\r\nr.t different foods=C3=82 is highest (not vegetables or fruits) for \n&gt;&gt;fish=\r\n, \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; and lowest for red meat and carrots. Infact the later is considere=\r\nd negative \n&gt;&gt; calorie food, since it requires the body to waste more calor=\r\nies in absorving it \n&gt;&gt;\n&gt;&gt; than the amount it gains from them. But fish is =\r\nthe easiet to digest. You can \n\n&gt;&gt; look up actual BV (biological value)=C3=\r\n=82 charts for more details.\n&gt;&gt; \n&gt;&gt; All this is science. Real science.

Assimilation of the nutrient into the bodymass (like BV=\r\n calc) and ease of bio-availability. Vitamin B12 for example is most easily=\r\n fond in animal carriers (it is a bacteria which uses an animal carrier) to=\r\n enter and assimilate into the human body. This can also be taken in from m=\r\nilk and soya flakes spread. But, ease of availaility descreases and finally=\r\n a doctor recommends taking Vitamin B12 suppliments - specially for women d=\r\nuring pregnancy - whose natural diet did not include the same. Also our bod=\r\ny being an organic matter and the supplements being mostly inorganic, the a=\r\nssimilation always happens less than ideal.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;=\r\n&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;Strictly from a scientific point of v=\r\niew, I have hardly seen any vegeterians being aware of the subtitutes to be=\r\n taken which can provide the same nutrients that a fish/meat/egg can provid=\r\ne, not to mention the fact that the substitutes are far more costly and oft=\r\nen unafforable for those who are not economically well off, specially in a =\r\ncountry like India. &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;f=\r\nont size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;The points you have jotted down also state the same thing an=\r\nd thus validate what I have stated.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/=\r\nfont&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;For the vast majority of the population l=\r\niving a fairly active lifestyle and access to sufficient vegetarian food, a=\r\ndequate protein intake is not an issue at all.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font si=\r\nze=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;The problem is, as I mention=\r\ned, most vegeterians are unaware of the right food, and further, in&nbsp;a =\r\ncoutry like India, the poor can never afford the vegeterian substitutes of =\r\nnon vegeterian nutrient sources.&lt;/font&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;&nbsp;&lt;/fon=\r\nt&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;font size=3D&quot;3&quot;&gt;How many vegeterians in India actually go to a d=\r\nietetics, or even a doctor to figure out the correct diet,&nbsp;even though=\r\n an average doctor has really very little knowledge of nutrition (which is =\r\nbecause nutrition is merely a two weeks course in a 4 years study).

Human body is naturally suited for an omnivorous diet. Just=\r\n like &lt;br&gt;&gt; people do not eat raw meat, normally, people do not eat raw =\r\nvegetables as well. &lt;br&gt;&gt; Cooking is a later addition to human society. =\r\n&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; If you were to clear your mind of all preconciev=\r\ned ideas and look at REAL &lt;br&gt;&gt; research in the most unbiased way possib=\r\nle, and accessed scientific papers in &lt;br&gt;&gt; clinical nutrition and diete=\r\ntics, as latest as 2010 june/july, you would find &lt;br&gt;&gt; ample evidence t=\r\nhat humans as a speicies, for many milleniums have relied on an &lt;br&gt;&gt; om=\r\nnivorous diet:-&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; a) Human\n ancestral diets changed substant=\r\nially approximately four to five &lt;br&gt;&gt; million years ago with major clim=\r\natic changes creating open grassland &lt;br&gt;&gt; environments. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&g=\r\nt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; b) Humans developed a larger brain balanced by a smaller, simpl=\r\ner &lt;br&gt;&gt; gastrointestinal tract=C3=82&nbsp; requiring=C3=82&nbsp;foods b=\r\nased around meat protein and fat. For &lt;br&gt;&gt; example since the time of Au=\r\nstralopithecus afarensis, some four to five million &lt;br&gt;&gt; years ago, bra=\r\nin size has increased threefold - chemical requirement for &lt;br&gt;&gt; long-ch=\r\nain polyunsaturated fatty acid chains in the brain - without a &lt;br&gt;&gt; cor=\r\nresponding increase in the Basal Metabolic Rate. This is possible only with=\r\n a &lt;br&gt;&gt; diet that is rich is animal protein. Simply put, in layman term=\r\ns, our brain &lt;br&gt;&gt; would not have reached the size and mass as it is tod=\r\nay, had it not been for &lt;br&gt;&gt; diet comprising of meat, fruits and vegeta=\r\nbles. &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; c) The gut\n morphology of the human body a=\r\ns it stand todays is ideally &lt;br&gt;&gt; equidistant from that of carnivores a=\r\ns well as herbivores. That is because &lt;br&gt;&gt; humans are designed to be om=\r\nnivores. The lack of a well developed caecum and &lt;br&gt;&gt; rumen, unlike her=\r\nbivores, makes it difficult for the body to absorve plant &lt;br&gt;&gt; cellulos=\r\ne into usable energy, which is why, a=C3=82&nbsp;major part of the leafy ve=\r\ngetable &lt;br&gt;&gt; based diet eventually ends up as roughage. On the other ha=\r\nnd, the stomach lining &lt;br&gt;&gt; of humans do not contain=C3=82&nbsp; the ki=\r\nnd of strong acids which is present in a typical &lt;br&gt;&gt; carnivore. This i=\r\ns because, humans, diet as set by Nature through=C3=82&nbsp; the natural &lt;b=\r\nr&gt;&gt; process of evolution is supposed to be omnivorous. It may further in=\r\nterest you &lt;br&gt;&gt; to know that the teeth structure of humans is actually =\r\nidentical to, guess what, &lt;br&gt;&gt; rats who also are omnivores.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br=\r\n&gt;&gt; d) It may shock many a preconcieved and\n mistaken ideas that=C3=82&nb=\r\nsp;research into &lt;br&gt;&gt; clinical nutrition very clearly indicates that ab=\r\nsorption ability of the human &lt;br&gt;&gt; body for=C3=82&nbsp;w.r.t different =\r\nfoods=C3=82&nbsp;is highest (not vegetables or fruits) for fish, &lt;br&gt;&gt; a=\r\nnd lowest for red meat and carrots. Infact the later is considered negative=\r\n &lt;br&gt;&gt; calorie food, since it requires the body to waste more calories i=\r\nn absorving it &lt;br&gt;&gt; than the amount it gains from them. But fish is the=\r\n easiet to digest. You can &lt;br&gt;&gt; look up actual BV (biological value)=C3=\r\n=82&nbsp;charts for more details.&lt;br&gt;&gt; &lt;br&gt;&gt; All this is science.
