Bhatla&quot; &lt;astrologytree@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Dear Friends,\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Last week while sieving our District Library I found a book &quot;Tarapeeth Bh=\r\nairav&quot;. I was inclined to borrow it so I did. When I read it I felt that I =\r\nam reading just another version of Aghora Volumes. Things written in Aghora=\r\n are also mentioned in it (Obviously not the story line but the facts relat=\r\ned to saadhna). While reading I was suddenly inclined to share about this i=\r\nn this group so I am writing here. This book will be helpful for people who=\r\n believe that Lot of things are written in between the lines in Aghora and =\r\nare unable to understand that &#39;in between the line&#39; content may find it hel=\r\npful. This book may not add anything much if you have already understood th=\r\nat &#39;in between the line&#39; content but it will be helpful if you are trying t=\r\no do so.  Some details about the book are as under.\n&gt; \n&gt; This Book is about=\r\n Yogi Vamacharan who lived about the same time as RamaKrishna Paramansa liv=\r\ned. Book also mentioned that vamacharan met Telanga Swami and also describe=\r\n meeting with Telanga swami. A Granth was written by Shri Sushil Kumar Vans=\r\nhopadyay dedicated to Vamacharan which was published in 1954. This was tran=\r\nslated in Hindi by Shri Chhavinath Mishra in 2001\n&gt; \n&gt; Name: Tarapeeth Bhai=\r\nrav\n&gt; Publisher: Vaamdev Sangh, Shri Ramendranath Basu, 8, Pramanik Ghaat R=\r\noad, Kaashipur, Kolkata. 700036.\n&gt; \n&gt; With the grace of Maa Tara\n&gt; \n&gt; Regar=\r\nds\n&gt; Atul\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
