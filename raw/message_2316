Why is it celebrated on the 4t=\r\nh day of bhadrabada shukla paksha? Ever since i started doing homam to shri=\r\n ganesh there is a keenness to know more and more about him.\n\nThere is an i=\r\nnteresting story about him that i would like to share in the cut and paste =\r\nstyle. \n\n&quot;There is also a story behind the symbolic snake, rat and the sing=\r\nular tusk. During one of his birthdays, His mother, Parvati, cooked for him=\r\n twenty-one types of delicious food and a lot of sweet porridge. Ganesha at=\r\ne so much that even his big belly could not contain it. Mounting his little=\r\n mouse, he embarked on his nightly rounds. His mouse suddenly stumbled upon=\r\n seeing a huge snake. To adjust His belly, Ganesha put the snake on as a be=\r\nlt around his stomach. All of a sudden, he heard laughter emanating form th=\r\ne sky.\n\n   He looked up and saw the moon mocking him. Ganesha infuriated, b=\r\nroke off one of his tusks and hurled it at the moon. Parvati, seeing this, =\r\nimmediately cursed the moon that whoever looks at it on Ganesh Chaturthi wi=\r\nll be accused of a wrong doing. The symbology behind the mouse and snake an=\r\nd Ganesha&#39;s big belly and its relationship to the moon on his birthday is h=\r\nighly philosophic. The whole cosmos is known to be the belly of Ganesha. Pa=\r\nrvati is the primordial energy. The seven realms above, seven realms below =\r\nand seven oceans, are inside the cosmic belly of Ganesha, held together by =\r\nthe cosmic energy (kundalini ) symbolized as a huge snake which Ganesha tie=\r\ns around Him. The mouse is nothing but our ego. Ganesha, using the mouse as=\r\n a vehicle, exemplifies the need to control our ego. One who has controlled=\r\n the ego has Ganesha consciousness or God-consciousness.&quot;\n\nOf course, this =\r\nis just a story. But then i got curious to know if there is actually a tabo=\r\no abt. looking at the moon on this day.\n\nHope we can all come closer to Gan=\r\nesh consiousness....with time and sadhana.\n\nRegards and best wishes\n\n\n\n\n"}}
