Please point out my mistakes I wi=\r\nll make in this process.\n&gt; \n&gt; We are trying to discuss three points here\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; 1) Choosing a dietary habit\n&gt; 2) Dependence of Human population on Non-v=\r\neg sources of nutrition\n&gt; 3) bioavailability or BV of Non veg vs Veg food.\n=\r\n&gt; \n&gt; I commented on two points \n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Choosing a dietary habit \n&gt; 2) Depe=\r\nndence of Human population on non veg sources of nutrition\n&gt; \n&gt; 1) Choosing=\r\n a Dietary habit\n&gt; \n&gt; One should choose his dietary habit based on his varn=\r\na (aptitude and attitude) and goal in his life. He should not bother what t=\r\nhe BV or other factor or research says. For an athlete, Eggs are important =\r\npart of his training. and for a person seeking spirituality one should stic=\r\nk to vegetarian food unless he is able to rise above the difference in veg =\r\nand nonveg. I agree with Narasimha Ji about this point.\n&gt; \n&gt; In some diseas=\r\nes Non veg sources play an very important role (Although not a necessasity)=\r\n like in Albumin deficiency two eggs per day can save a person from costly =\r\n(3000Rs per Inj) Albumin Injections. In TB, Soup made of goat meat do wonde=\r\nrs. Ayurveda also recommend it strongly Charak Samhita) etc.\n&gt; \n&gt; 2) Depend=\r\nence of Human population on non veg sources of nutrition\n&gt; \n&gt; I agree with =\r\nthe link provided in this discussions. Books and articles by Peta members a=\r\nre far more convincing for switching to Veg sources. I can also provide ten=\r\ns of links and book reference which oppose their view. Honestly, I do not b=\r\nelieve each and every information on net and not every book written about n=\r\nutirtion, just like astrology. Let us leave this debate aside and look at o=\r\nther aspect of it.\n&gt; \n&gt; By &#39;Practically impossible&#39; I meant the cost factor=\r\n and demand/supply factor. In India (Leave other high Nonveg consuming coun=\r\ntries alone) about 45% people are Non vegetarian and about 40% demand of Pr=\r\noteins are supplied by Non veg sources. Currently, Important veg sourcesof =\r\nproteins are Legumes (including gram soyabean, pulses etc. Costs about Rs 8=\r\n0 -120 Rs per Kg), Nuts (include almonds cashew etc - Costs needn&#39;t mention=\r\n), Dairy products (Milk being 30-40 Rs per Kg), Grains (cheapest sources bu=\r\nt not a very complete source), \n&gt; \n&gt; In last two years, their demand rose b=\r\ny 15-20 % but their price rose by 40-60%. even at current price, 60 % of po=\r\npulation can not afford a complete balanced diet as recommended by Experts =\r\nwhich include 250 Ml of milk, 50-70 gms of legumes, 10 gms of vegetables, 1=\r\n50 gms of fruits per person, along with grains and roughage etc (These are =\r\napprox minimum quantities. Different sources may quote different quantities=\r\n). There is average family size of 5 and average family income is 200 Rs pe=\r\nr day! And nutrition is not the only thing needed in our life!!! Lot of oth=\r\ner expenditures are there\n&gt; \n&gt; Even at current prices, 60% population can n=\r\not afford balanced diet. If additional 40% is included in demand of veg sou=\r\nrces, price may rise another 100% and I need not to explain what will happe=\r\nn at that time.\n&gt; \n&gt; Sir, I am not advocating Non-veg food here. I am also =\r\na strict vegetarian, even for milk I prefer a source where there is minimum=\r\n cruelity (Yes you can not expect no cruelity even for milk if you buy it f=\r\nrom market and do not produce it yourself)\n&gt; \n&gt; Again, I think and believe =\r\nthat practically it is impossible to shift all the population to veg source=\r\ns especially when the agriculture land is decreasing day by day because of =\r\nmany reasons)\n&gt; \n&gt; 3) Bioavailability or BV of different sources\n&gt; \n&gt; It is=\r\n always a questionable point. because again sections supporting vegetarian =\r\ndiet will highlight the results which support veg food and vice versa. Ther=\r\ne are lot of halfbaked researches. but if we think scientifically we will f=\r\nind that for different sources different sources are better. For example ca=\r\nlcium animal sources are best (Including milk), for albumin Egg is best, fo=\r\nr Vit C veg sources are best, for proteins animal sources are best (Ayurved=\r\na also support this) So I think we can not say that only veg or non veg wil=\r\nl suffice the diet. Obviously humans can not survive on Nonveg food alone. =\r\nAs far as BV is concerned I agree with the values given by Rajarshi ji.\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; Yes, I agree Non veg food increases tamas in mind. But so does the deep f=\r\nried vegetarian food, although less but in daily habit it will not let you =\r\nescape from Tamas. I agree with Narasimha Ji that if more energy is used in=\r\n digesting food, less energy is available for brain. it is a scietific fact=\r\n that after food, significant blood supply is directed to intestines. How m=\r\nuch Rajas Spicy food, tea, coffee, coke and Red bull is increasing in us? W=\r\ne are what we eat! This is true. So one should eat what one want to become.=\r\n\n&gt; \n&gt; But still at last, I want to mention that I am not advocating Non-veg=\r\n food. I am just highlighting the facts. I am a strict vegetarian too. We s=\r\nhould understand that we may be right but we should realise that it does no=\r\nt necessarily mean other person is not right.\n&gt; \n&gt; Please point out my mist=\r\nakes I had made in this post. I agree that some values i mentioned here may=\r\n not be exactly as quoted by sources. But they are approximate and not too =\r\nmuch off the line.\n&gt; \n&gt; Kind Regards\n&gt; Atul\n&gt; \n&gt; --- In vedic-wisdom@yahoog=\r\nroups.com, rajarshi nandy &lt;rajarshi14@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste Narasimha,\n&gt;=\r\n &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; I disgree with two points you mentioned. Let me clarify=\r\n. (I am only dealing with \n&gt; &gt; the science part of these discussions, as I =\r\nhad already maintained right at the \n&gt; &gt; beginning).\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; (=\r\n3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) sev=\r\neral \n&gt; &gt; months back.

The ones \n&gt; &gt; fed with meat were duller.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; If=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0you have any references for this, in terms of whether they published =\r\nany \n&gt; &gt; paper on the same, I am interested to know and analyse that in det=\r\nails. I am \n&gt; &gt; open to learning and reviewing my position, provided there =\r\nis genuine evidence.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Their theory was that digestion o=\r\nf meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with \n&gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may hav=\r\ne diverted more energy towards the development of brain. \n&gt; &gt; Though they w=\r\nere not sure if the same thing applies to human beings or not,=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0a \n&gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s inte=\r\nllectual development.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; This is a wrong theory as far as=\r\n human nutrition=C3=82=C2=A0is concerned, because human \n&gt; &gt; stomach struct=\r\nure (gut morphology) is such that it finds certain animal products \n&gt; &gt; far=\r\n easier to digest than most planet based products. In my other mail, I have=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; qoted from a couple of research papers and books on clinical nutritio=\r\nn and \n&gt; &gt; dietetics, and if you ask, I can provide more; which may=C3=82=\r\n=C2=A0take a few days since I \n&gt; &gt; have to get them from people who deal wi=\r\nth these topics professionally, but time \n&gt; &gt; is not a problem.=C3=82=C2=A0=\r\nAll the papers are=C3=82=C2=A0from the most accepted and reputed \n&gt; &gt; scien=\r\ntific=C3=82=C2=A0journals. There is no confusion. Which is why I said, it i=\r\ns myth \n&gt; &gt; that=C3=82=C2=A0vegeterian=C3=82=C2=A0foods are=C3=82=C2=A0easi=\r\ner to digest, if digestibility is the criteria. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =\r\nFurther, in my experience, I never found traditional vegeterians to be any =\r\nmore \n&gt; &gt; dull or smarter than traditional omnivores. \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=\r\n=A0\n&gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas and=\r\n their needs. \n&gt; &gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Other=\r\nwise, feed the poor \n&gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n An animal has a specific physical=C3=82=C2=A0structure and needs to mainta=\r\nin the same. But \n&gt; &gt; if trained they can &#39;adjust&#39; to any kind of meals. I =\r\nhave seen people feeding \n&gt; &gt; vegeterian diets to dogs. Statistically speak=\r\ning, an animal whose whole body \n&gt; &gt; structure is designed to be a carnivor=\r\ne, may adjust to any food for the sake of \n&gt; &gt; survival, but will become in=\r\nternally weak and susceptable to disease and \n&gt; &gt; weaknesses. Who takes the=\r\n karma for the disease and weakness that may result \n&gt; &gt; from an unnatural =\r\ndiet to an animal? \n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Not that all dogs who are fee=\r\nd a veg diet end up being diseased, but the chances \n&gt; &gt; increase a lot. It=\r\n is like not all smokers die of cancer, but smoking makes one \n&gt; &gt; suscepti=\r\nble to cancer. It increases the probability. Therefore my personal \n&gt; &gt; opi=\r\nnion is that an animal if kept at home, it should taken care of in the best=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; way possible, providing it with whatever maybe needed, including the =\r\nright diet.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; _______________\n&gt; &gt; =C3=\r\n=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; A question for you.\n&gt; &gt; =C3=82=C2=A0\n&gt; &gt; Sci=\r\nentists studying evolution and human body structures have concluded that me=\r\nat \n&gt; &gt; eating along with cropping and fruits has been prevelant since at l=\r\neast 4 \n&gt; &gt; million years. That, without a diet which was omnivorous, the s=\r\ntructure of the \n&gt; &gt; human stomach (lack of a developed=C3=82=C2=A0caecum),=\r\n=C3=82=C2=A0and the threefold increase in=C3=82=C2=A0brain \n&gt; &gt; size (from =\r\narcheological evidences)=C3=82=C2=A0could never have been what it is today.=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; Which means, an omnivorous diet has been a=C3=82=C2=A0natural process=\r\n, so ingrained that it \n&gt; &gt; has changed the very structure of the human bod=\r\ny. This cannot be done \n&gt; &gt; consciously, but only by the work of natural fo=\r\nrces.

A few quick comments.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (1) We are we=\r\n we eat. Production of various chemicals in our body and their \n&gt; &gt; interac=\r\ntions, are controlled by what we eat. Thus, what we eat has a profound \n&gt; &gt;=\r\n impact on us.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (2) Much has been written on the material benefits =\r\nfrom vegetarianism. But that \n&gt; &gt; is not all. There are spiritual and subtl=\r\ne reasons as well.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Eating the flesh or body parts of an animal tha=\r\nt strongly identifies with the \n&gt; &gt; physical body entails a karma. Self-ide=\r\nntification of plants with their physical \n&gt; &gt; body is much subtler and the=\r\n karma entailed in eating plant-based foods is much \n&gt; &gt; smaller.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nEspecially these days, very cruel methods are used for meat production by \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; corporations and animals are treated very cruelly. Part of the karma fo=\r\nr their \n&gt; &gt; suffering goes to the ones benefiting from their meat.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; =\r\n&gt; (3) I heard an interview with a scientist on NPR (National Public Radio) =\r\nseveral \n&gt; &gt; months back. They conducted an experiment on gorillas. One set=\r\n of gorillas was \n&gt; &gt; fed with meat. The other set was fed with nuts, fruit=\r\ns etc. After several \n&gt; &gt; months, researchers found a gap in the intelligen=\r\nce of the two sets. The ones \n&gt; &gt; fed with meat were duller.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Their=\r\n theory was that digestion of meat takes up more energy. Gorillas fed with =\r\n\n&gt; &gt; nuts and fruits may have diverted more energy towards the development =\r\nof brain. \n&gt; &gt; Though they were not sure if the same thing applies to human=\r\n beings or not, a \n&gt; &gt; balanced vegetarian diet perhaps can maximize one&#39;s =\r\nintellectual development.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (4) After we eat a heavy meal, we may fe=\r\nel dull or sleepy and cannot focus well \n&gt; &gt; on work that requires alertnes=\r\ns and skill. That is because the digestive process \n&gt; &gt; is using up a lot o=\r\nf energy (also known as agni or fire) and there isn&#39;t much \n&gt; &gt; agni availa=\r\nble for other activities such as digestion of intellectual ideas that \n&gt; &gt; =\r\nhappens in the mind. Similarly, digestion of spiritual ideas/experiences al=\r\nso \n&gt; &gt; requires agni and that cannot happen well. That is why meditation o=\r\nr homam after \n&gt; &gt; a heavy meal are fruitless and we are normally advised t=\r\no do sadhana before \n&gt; &gt; eating.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (5) If foods that light up a high=\r\ner digestive agni (e.g. meats, deep fried food \n&gt; &gt; with more oil, spicy fo=\r\nods that stimulate digestive agni etc) are consumed more \n&gt; &gt; frequently, a=\r\ngni is diverted towards digestion more often and there is less agni \n&gt; &gt; av=\r\nailable for assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and experiences. =\r\nIf \n&gt; &gt; one eats saattwik food that is very easy to digest (simple grains, =\r\nsimple \n&gt; &gt; lentils and simple vegetables, all softly cooked with mild spic=\r\nes, and fruits), \n&gt; &gt; less agni is diverted towards digestion and more agni=\r\n is available for \n&gt; &gt; assimilaring intellectual and spiritual ideas and ex=\r\nperiences.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (6) Even a big fire cannot burn wet grass well. But hug=\r\ne stacks of dry grass may \n&gt; &gt; be burnt by just one spark! Similarly, littl=\r\ne bit of internal fire may be enough \n&gt; &gt; to assimilate spiritual ideas and=\r\n experiences in a person with excellent \n&gt; &gt; vaasanas and few obstructions =\r\n(dry grass). A lot of internal fire may be needed \n&gt; &gt; in a person with poo=\r\nr vaasanas and many obstructions (wet grass). Thus, it all \n&gt; &gt; depends on =\r\nvaasanas and impurities in nadis and chakras.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; One person may eat m=\r\neat and deep fried foods, spend a lot of agni on digesting \n&gt; &gt; them and ye=\r\nt make excellent spiritual progress. Another person may eat saattwik \n&gt; &gt; f=\r\nood, maximize the agni available for spiritual transformation and yet strug=\r\ngle \n&gt; &gt; to progress spiritually. However, the best course of action for on=\r\ne is to ignore \n&gt; &gt; counter-examples and be a vegetarian. All other things =\r\nbeing equal, that \n&gt; &gt; maximizes the agni available for spiritual progress.=\r\n\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (7) Regarding Priya&#39;s question: Animals have their own vaasanas a=\r\nnd their needs. \n&gt; &gt; If an animal can survive on vegetarian food, good. Oth=\r\nerwise, feed the poor \n&gt; &gt; fellow whatever he/she needs.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (8) One s=\r\nhould eat to live and not live to eat. A yogi should consume enough \n&gt; &gt; fo=\r\nod to sustain oneself so that one can fulfil one&#39;s dharma in the material \n=\r\n&gt; &gt; world using physical body and make spiritual progress. Eating too much =\r\nfood is \n&gt; &gt; not good for spiritual sadhana.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; Instead of overeating=\r\n most of the time and fasting on specific days, it is \n&gt; &gt; better to eat li=\r\nmited amount always. Regular practices are more important for \n&gt; &gt; transfor=\r\nmation and success, than occasional practices.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; (9) By merely think=\r\ning that god is the doer of all actions or considering food \n&gt; &gt; to be god&#39;=\r\ns prasad, one cannot escape the karma involved. It depends on how \n&gt; &gt; deep=\r\nly ingrained that thought is and how deeply one feels so. If one internally=\r\n \n&gt; &gt; feels 100% that god is acting through one and whatever one is doing (=\r\ne.g. \n&gt; &gt; eating) is just god&#39;s prasad to one, then one is free.\n&gt; &gt; \n&gt; &gt; B=\r\nest regards,\n&gt; &gt; Narasimha\n&gt; &gt; --------------------------------------------=\r\n--------------\n&gt; &gt; Free Jyotish Software, Free Jyotish Lessons, Jyotish Wri=\r\ntings,\n&gt; &gt; &quot;Do It Yourself&quot; ritual manuals for short Homam and Pitri Tarpan=\r\na:\n&gt; &gt; http://www.VedicAstrologer.org\n&gt; &gt; Films that make a difference: htt=\r\np://SaraswatiFilms.org \n&gt; &gt; Spirituality: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/ved=\r\nic-wisdom\n&gt; &gt; Jyotish writings: http://groups.yahoo.com/group/JyotishWritin=\r\ngs\n&gt; &gt; ----------------------------------------------------------\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
