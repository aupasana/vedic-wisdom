Shriram Sharma Acharya\n\nDear ALL,\n\nThe ear in a human body is said to be the most sensitive and powerful radar\navailable in this world. Apart from its unique capacities of sensing,\nfiltering and identifying a large variety of sounds in the spectrum of\naudible frequencies - in its most general state, a healthy ear in the human\nbody can as well sense smaller (low in pitch and loudness) sounds from long\ndistances if the external disturbances are removed. For instance, we can\nhear the buzzing sound of a bee from about 6ft in an otherwise silent\nsurrounding. Controlled experiments in advanced telecommunication centers\n(including AT & T Bell Labs, New Jersey, USA) have recorded several such\nextraordinary sensing capabilities of human ears. These include the\nsuccessful &#39;listening&#39; of the physiological tremors by different groups of\nhuman subjects under different soundproof experimental conditions.\n\nModern technology is still far away from developing an electronic analogue\nof the natural device like the human ear. The fine sensor - the tympanum,\ninside our ears - is made up of an ultra-thin membrane of thickness of about\n4 X10-10 inches only. Even in the average normal conditions, i.e., without\nany practice of Nada Yoga, the sensing power of this unimaginably thin\nmembrane is about ten thousand times more than that of the most powerful\nsensor developed by the state of art technology till date.\n\nTheoretical analysis of the models of the structure and functioning of the\nhuman ear indicates that it can discriminate about four hundred thousand\ndifferent kinds of sounds. There have been noted musicians who could\nrecognize the individual sound of each of the hundred odd instruments being\nplayed jointly in an orchestra.\nThe tympanum of our ears focuses the receiving sound waves at a point and\nsends them through a connecting tube where these waves are transformed into\nelectrical signals. Three tiny bones, forming a triangle, serve the purpose\nof a piston at this juncture. As the signals reach the snail- shaped\nlymphous hole at the deeper end of the ear, the sounds &#39;contained&#39; in them\nbecome clearer and are perceived as &#39;heard&#39;. The membrane of this third part\nof our natural hearing device is directly connected with the brain. Each of\nthe sonic vibrations received at the tympanum are propagated deep inside the\nconnecting channel by about 3500 tiny particles working as electrical\ntransmitters. The corresponding signals are received by the brain in less\nthan a thousandth fraction of a second. The brain instantaneously sends the\nsignals to the memory cells (layers in the neuronal network) where the\nassociated sound is recognized. This is how the long multi-phased process of\n&#39;hearing&#39; takes place in a negligible amount of time, in our biological\n&#39;telephone&#39;. The distance within which the sonic vibrations can enter as\nvalid inputs for processing in the ear depends on some neuro-physiological\nparameters. Hence the number of muscles at the entrance of the tympanum\nplays an important role here, too. For example, the number of such muscles\nin a human ear is nine whereas in a ear of a horse this number is seventeen;\na horse can listen from proportionately longer distances than us.\n\nOur memory has a direct link with the power of perception and recognition of\nthe sounds received by our ears. Napoleon-I had amazingly sharp\naudio-memory. He could remember the names of each of the soldiers in his\narmy who had not even come in contact with him and used to correctly\nrecognize their voices. Alexander the Great is also said to have been\nblessed with such extraordinary memory; he was able to recognize the voices\nheard after a long span of time. He could even locate the place of the\nsource of a voice even if he had heard it from a very long distance.\n...
