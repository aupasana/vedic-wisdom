There are many interpretation of these words, all=\r\n viable since the words spoken by a person of infinite consciousness can ha=\r\nve infinite meanings. But one I feel is legitimate is the idea that those o=\r\nf lesser evolution (&quot;foxes&quot; and &quot;birds&quot;) can find a home on earth, but a tr=\r\nue, awakened, human being cannot.\n\nPlease do not look for a spiritual home,=\r\n or a place where you belong, on this earth=96and that includes churches, s=\r\npiritual groups, or ashrams. You are not even a human being=96you are a god=\r\n within God. And only God is your home. Disappointment and frustration, not=\r\n to mention pain and grief, can only result from trying to find a resting p=\r\nlace anywhere but in Infinity. That is a tough thing to face, but if we are=\r\n to be spiritual adults the bullet must be faced and bitten.\n\nMany people&#39;s=\r\n lives are a chain of &quot;home at lasts,&quot; none of which really are home at all=\r\n, as they eventually discover. They were spiritually beneficial and worthy =\r\nof gratitude and respect, necessary steps=96but that is just it: steps lead=\r\ning to something higher. If we come to rest on any of them we will stagnate=\r\n and die.\n\nGrowth is change=96keep on changing! The spiritual stick-in-the-=\r\nmuds will look at you and cluck and shake their heads and talk about instab=\r\nility and being &quot;out of tune with Master&quot; and other tripe. They like stagna=\r\nncy and, as Jesus said, they have their reward. But you be different.\n\nGo f=\r\norward!\n\nSri Ramakrishna told the parable of a woodcutter who met a sadhu i=\r\nn the forest that told him: &quot;Go further.&quot; He did, and discovered a sandalwo=\r\nod grove. He started to cut it but remembered he had been told Go Further, =\r\nso he went on. He found an iron deposit, then a copper deposit, then a silv=\r\ner deposit, then a gold deposit, and finally a diamond field=96all because =\r\nhe kept on going further.\n\nAll teachings and teachers are finite and limite=\r\nd by human boundaries. Eventually they must all be grown beyond. Truth is a=\r\nnother matter altogether. Discovery of Truth should be the purpose of teach=\r\nings and teachers, but is it? Aren&#39;t most of them meant to &quot;answer all ques=\r\ntions,&quot; &quot;give comfort,&quot; or &quot;bring peace&quot;? Are there any real answers, comfo=\r\nrt, or peace in this world? I don&#39;t think so. However, all rungs of the lad=\r\nder are worthy of regard. Without the rungs of a ladder or the steps of a s=\r\ntair we do not ascend, but we ascend by leaving them behind, not stopping o=\r\nn them and calling all the world to come stand still with us. It is the wil=\r\nlingness to keep moving onward, leaving everything behind, that is the high=\r\nest renunciation. Years ago I came to realize that the journey was never go=\r\ning to end as long as I was moving from point to point rather than stepping=\r\n off into eternity.\n\nSomeone asked Shankara: &quot;What is truth [satya]?&quot; Shank=\r\nara replied: &quot;There is no `truth.&#39; There is only The True [Sat].&quot; As Sister=\r\n Gyanamata said: God Alone. Like the egoic children we are, we hate admitti=\r\nng that we were wrong in thinking we had &quot;found it.&quot; The ego keeps people &quot;=\r\nloyal&quot; from life to life. &quot;God and Guru&quot; my foot. In God there is no &quot;and.&quot;=\r\n Remember: Sri Ramakrishna did not attain liberation until he mentally cut =\r\nthe living image of Kali in half with the sword of discrimination.\n\nDoes th=\r\nis all sound like I am one of those cynical, warped, and dried up souls lik=\r\ne Krishnamurti that denounce everyone but themselves and all ideas but thei=\r\nrs? I hope not, for you cannot progress without any of these things I have =\r\nmentioned, but you must also get (grow) beyond them. Every time you sit to =\r\ndo math, do you call up your first math teacher and ask her to come do it f=\r\nor you? Or when you get the right answer, do you say: &quot;I have done nothing.=\r\n It is all my first grade arithmetic teacher. All credit goes to her&quot;? Of c=\r\nourse not, because you aren&#39;t nuts. So why be spiritually crazy?\n\nWalking t=\r\nhe Path\n\nPeople talk about &quot;walking the Path,&quot; but the whole idea of the pa=\r\nth is to come to its end and leave it behind. All books, however wise, have=\r\n an ending, as do the discourses of even avatars. And then the Real Thing b=\r\negins. We will not reach the Real without the paths, the books, or the disc=\r\nourses, but we must use them, not idolatrize them. A few years ago I figure=\r\nd out the universal motto of all religions: Adore The Messenger And Ignore =\r\nThe Message. The message is always: Move on until you reach the place where=\r\n there is no more &quot;on.&quot;\n\nThe problem is not with the Masters but with the i=\r\ngnorant and deluded &quot;disciples.&quot; The Masters liberate, the groupies bind. D=\r\no you have the recording: Self-Realization: the Inner and the Outer Path? D=\r\nr. Lewis&#39;s talk presents the right perspective: it is not an organization b=\r\nut an attainment.\n\nI say all this because I know how a seeker can suffer fr=\r\nom continual disillusionment if he keeps conscious and keeps his eyes open.=\r\n But you will not suffer, only benefit, if you understand the way things ar=\r\ne. Learn. Apply. Move on. It is all between you and God. And since when doe=\r\ns God need any vows or promises? Either you seek Him or you don&#39;t. And He c=\r\nan tell the difference.\n\nBreak all dependencies\n\nMy chief interest for some=\r\n years has been how people can break all dependencies and find God on their=\r\n own. Nearly all religious and &quot;spiritual&quot; situations involve manipulation =\r\nand dependence. Religion is the number one field for Victimizers and Victim=\r\ns, though with sacred labels instead of the true ones. Coercion and submiss=\r\nion is the order of the day. It is evil.\n\nThere are many things that people=\r\n need at a certain level of development, but a time comes when external inp=\r\nut no longer is what we need. Rather, we must open up the inner life and li=\r\nve on that alone. &quot;Man shall not live by bread alone&quot; implies this. The &quot;wo=\r\nrd that proceedeth out of the mouth of God&quot; is purely internal. God speaks =\r\nin the depths of our spirit, the core of our consciousness. No, He does not=\r\n speak as a cosmic rumble as we sit with our thumbs stuck in our ears. That=\r\n, too, is outward-turned. Rather, He speaks as &quot;a still small voice&quot; in the=\r\n inner silence.\n\nThe absolute essential is the procedure by which our entir=\r\ne being is transmuted into the Life Divine. Just this morning I was reading=\r\n Dr. I. K. Taimni&#39;s statement that the purpose of following and seeking the=\r\n Truth is to be the Truth. Ultimately, though not prematurely, we must come=\r\n to say with Jesus: &quot;I am the way, the truth, and the life.&quot; We need to pas=\r\ns from feeding on the Bread of Life to becoming the Bread of Life. This is =\r\nreal Yoga=96nothing else.\n\nI have declaimed enough. Thank you for your lett=\r\ners. I hope you find something of what I have written useful=96if only to d=\r\nisagree with it!\n\n\n"}}
