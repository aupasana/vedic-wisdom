How this small yet powerful part of man can be completely blind! It is=\r\n like a destructive drug, for whoever falls victim to ego loses everything.=\r\n It is like a wild animal that destroys everything in its path without cons=\r\nideration. Destruction of others and of one&#39;s self, is the result of an unc=\r\nontrolled ego. \n\nNourishment for the powerful ego is found in the intellect=\r\n. Intellect is both wonderful and dangerous. Trained, developed and properl=\r\ny used, the intellect is one of the highest faculties. However if used impr=\r\noperly, the intellect only gathers impressions and passes judgement. Nothin=\r\ng is integrated, nothing is experienced and Reality is disregarded. The int=\r\nellect then believes itself to be Omniscient and Master of the world.\n\nTher=\r\ne is a wise Indian saying. There are eight manifestations of mental alcohol=\r\n which blind the intellect: pride of race, of youth, of beauty, of physical=\r\n strength, of family, of position, of money and of knowledge. Vanity blinds=\r\n like the strutting arrogance of a drunkard who considers himself superhuma=\r\nn. In reality he has lost control. Many people suffer from the illness of p=\r\nride, which brings symptoms of jealousy, being argumentative, hate and dist=\r\nrust.\n\nIt&#39;s not difficult to carry a full water pot on the top of your head=\r\n, as they do in India, but you will not get far before a half-filled one sl=\r\noshes and spills. In the same way, the mind is always subject to disturbanc=\r\ne as long as knowledge is imperfect and incomplete.\n\nThis is how it was wit=\r\nh one group of men who had retired from their profession. Formerly railway =\r\nofficials, professors, military men and Sanskrit scholars, each of them pos=\r\nsessed a certain amount of knowledge and skill,  but were terribly conceite=\r\nd about them. Having nothing to do, they passed their time travelling aroun=\r\nd, humiliating people by challenging debates. They especially liked to emba=\r\nrrass other learned men or swamis with their practiced questioning.\n\nOne da=\r\ny, this group came to Mahaprabhuji&#39;s ashram as he was holding satsang.\n\n&quot;We=\r\n have heard you are a great scholar and we have come to be convinced it is =\r\nso,&quot; one of them provocatively asked. &quot;Tell us what you know!&quot;\n\nMahaprabhuj=\r\ni had no chance to reply before another interrupted, who had some poetic ab=\r\nility.\n\n&quot;Recite one of your poems, we want to assess your skill!&quot;\n\nRemainin=\r\ng peaceful, Mahaprabhuji welcomed the men with a loving heart, just as he w=\r\nelcomed all visitors and graciously invited them to sit down. He looked at =\r\nthem and as nothing was hidden from him, he knew their thoughts and charact=\r\neristics. In a bhajan he began to reveal their negative attributes, so as t=\r\no instruct them in better behaviour.\n\nDear readers, it is difficult to tran=\r\nslate Mahaprabhuji&#39;s beautiful poetry into English, as it has quite a diffe=\r\nrent feeling in Hindi. Therefore I can only attempt to convey the general e=\r\nssence of that bhajan here.\n\n \n\nKAHA VED PATHI TRIPATHI KAHAVE\n\nThose who s=\r\ntudy and call themselves scholars,\n\nThose who consider themselves poets,\n\nT=\r\nhose who dress themselves like holy men,\n\nThose who prize external cleanlin=\r\ness,\n\nWhat do they gain if they have not studied the Supreme\n\nOr purified t=\r\nheir mind?\n\nIf they have not realized God,\n\nWhat&#39;s the use of poetry or a s=\r\nplendid gown?\n\nThose who study law yet still don&#39;t know the law of God,\n\nTh=\r\nose who think only of their body\n\nWhich will one day be ash spread by the w=\r\nind,\n\nWhat can they gain from this?\n\nOnly God can stop the fallacy of such =\r\nthoughts,\n\nWithout Him, all is just pretence.\n\n \n\nIn further verses the bha=\r\njan refers to the true aim of life: to behave well and not only to `appear&#39;=\r\n well.\n\nSuddenly it seemed to these retired men, that they had accomplished=\r\n absolutely nothing in their entire lives. They were seized with sorrow as =\r\nthey realized that they were growing old and might not have much time to ma=\r\nke amends.\n\n&quot;O Master,&quot; they cried, &quot;is it really too late for us? We surre=\r\nnder ourselves to you and humbly beg your guidance and protection. Gracious=\r\n Lord, can you forgive us?&quot;\n\nMahaprabhuji&#39;s heart is full of love for all c=\r\nreatures and there was no question of anger or annoyance within him. He den=\r\nied no one, forgave all and corrected and removed the negative qualities of=\r\n those who put their trust in him. Lovingly he looked at them and sang agai=\r\nn:\n\n \n\nSANTO SE KOI SIROMANI MANUSYA\n\nThe Saint is the crown of humanity!\n\n=\r\nThe Gita, Ramayana, Bible and Koran all praise the glory of Saints,\n\nTheir =\r\nwords shower all mankind in Blessing.\n\nThe Saint selflessly gives, he gives=\r\n everything to everyone,\n\nHe lives not for himself, he lives only for other=\r\ns,\n\nAs a messenger of God, he comes in love and compassion\n\nTo purify the w=\r\norld of sins!\n\nGod&#39;s mercy we experience through the blessing of the Saint,=\r\n\n\nThe Saint is unsurpassed\n\nIn love, devotion, humility, kindness and mercy=\r\n.\n\n \n\nWhen Mahaprabhuji had finished the bhajan, he said, &quot;With the blessin=\r\ng of a Saint it is possible to realize everything, but don&#39;t be deceived, d=\r\near brothers! As you well know, the ego surrounds itself with the appearanc=\r\ne of wisdom and many call themselves holy or pretend to be wise. Go where y=\r\nour thirst will be quenched. If your heart is really seeking then you will =\r\nfind your Master. My dears, your prayers for forgiveness are heard, it is n=\r\never too late to do good, every second is valuable.&quot;\n\nThe men begged Gurude=\r\nva, &quot;Lord, please initiate us and take us as your disciples.&quot;\n\n&quot;I will give=\r\n you a mantra which you shall practise every day,&quot; Mahaprabhuji answered. &quot;=\r\nFrom now on learn to be as kind and humble to all as much you were unkind b=\r\nefore. Never forget there is something you can learn from everyone and only=\r\n God the Almighty is perfect.&quot;\n\nGrateful for his words, they left Mahaprabh=\r\nuji and praised him with all their hearts. For these men the following word=\r\ns from The Ramayana proved true: &quot;Only by God&#39;s mercy is it possible to mee=\r\nt a realized Master.&quot;\n(taken from http://www.yogaindailylife.org/swamiji/li=\r\nlaamrit/victory-over-false-pride)\n\n\n"}}
