Whats the FIRST a=\r\nccount of karma of a jeeva(in any form)?\n2. Considering the scheme of etern=\r\nity in the background, what circumstances would have led a jeeva to take a =\r\nright or wrong turn, which decided its future journey of eternity?\n3. Assum=\r\ning that two jeevas started of their journey at some point, what triggered =\r\none to take a right and another to take a wrong turn? (Assuming that one wh=\r\nich too right at the first instance realized the supreme sooner than the ot=\r\nher which is far way from the goal of realization becauase of multiplicatio=\r\nn of wrong turns as a result of previous wrong - on the net balance basis)\n=\r\n\nAny thoughts on the above would help me strengthen my basics.\n\nThanks & Re=\r\ngards\n\nSridhar \n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, &quot;seeker201097&quot; &lt;seeke=\r\nr201097@...&gt; wrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Pranams,\n&gt; \n&gt; Learned members please help me with t=\r\nhis puzzle. Every time I come across the karma theory the following puzzle =\r\ntroubles me.\n&gt; \n&gt; Let&#39;s take two milestomes of world population. In the yea=\r\nr 1927 it was 2 billion and in the year 1999 it was 6 billion. That means i=\r\nt has multiplied three fold over a period of seventy two years which is the=\r\n average human longevity. Let&#39;s leave aside the fine maths about these figu=\r\nres. This means that every human being who existed in 1927 must have died b=\r\nefore 1999 and reborn( you may leave provison of a few millions for those c=\r\nentenarians). There were 2 billion jeevatmas &quot;trapped in human bodies&quot;in 19=\r\n27 and 6 billion in 1999, an additional 4 billion. Where did they come from=\r\n? I am able to see only two possibilities.\n&gt; \n&gt; 1. Each jeevatma divided it=\r\nself into 3 ( or more or less). In which case did the sanchita karma of the=\r\n original jeevatma of 1927 also get divided between the three ? That should=\r\n make the karma less intense nowadyas. Or did the 3 jeevatmas inherit the e=\r\nntire karma of their predecessor each one in full (poornamada poornamidam .=\r\n.......)?\n&gt; \n&gt; 2.Some jeevatmas &quot;trapped&quot; in plants and animals graduated i=\r\nnto humans. Karma arises only out of action performed with free will or act=\r\nion performed with attachment. Plants and animals do not carry any sanchita=\r\n karma. When they are at the entry level of a series of human lives they sh=\r\nould be coming in with a zero balance of sanchita karma. In which case, at =\r\nleast 4 billion (or even a billion if my maths is wrong !) of the world pop=\r\nulation should not have any sanchita karma.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or, it could be a mix of t=\r\nhe above two.\n&gt; \n&gt; Or, is it possible that the total number of humans who h=\r\nave died until now could exceed 6 billion ? This may not be possible becaus=\r\ne from generation to generation we see a multiplication of numbers. 1+2+4 c=\r\nan not be more than 8. That&#39;s why the population is on the increase.\n&gt; \n&gt; P=\r\nlease help.\n&gt;\n\n\n\n"}}
