I have always come ac=\r\nross different variations in the\npronounciation of the MahaMrityunyay mantr=\r\na, more specifically in the\nword &#39;Bandhanaan&#39;. I have heard it being pronou=\r\nnced as &#39;Aum Tryambakam\nYajamahe...Urvarukmiva Bandhanaam&#39;, &#39;Bandhanaat&#39; an=\r\nd &#39;Bandhanaan&#39;. I\nhave no clue as to what part of the Rig Veda to look for =\r\n- to verify\nthe correct sanskrit word. So, I have always pronounced it with=\r\n a\nsilent &#39;aan&#39; at the end just because it &#39;felt&#39; right. (Still don&#39;t\nknow =\r\nif it&#39;s right) But it has nevertheless, always produced\npositive results es=\r\npecially in regard to curing illnesses.\n\nSuch is the generosity of the Lord=\r\n! :) \n\nHar Har Mahadev!\n\n--- In vedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com, Jitendra Triv=\r\nedi &lt;trivedijv@...&gt;\nwrote:\n&gt;\n&gt; Shree Ajit Bhai,\n&gt; \n&gt; pranaam and thankyou f=\r\nor the wonderful explanation of the Mantra.\n&gt; \n&gt; Hari Om Harr\n&gt; \n&gt; Jitu\n&gt; \n=\r\n&gt; On Wed, Feb 18, 2009 at 1:05 PM, gulatiganesh &lt;gulatiganesh@...&gt;wrote:\n&gt; =\r\n\n&gt; &gt;   Dear Shri Ajit Ji,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Namaste,\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Thanks for the reply and=\r\n elaborately explaining the meaning.\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; Ganesh Gulati\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; --- In v=\r\nedic-wisdom@yahoogroups.com\n&lt;vedic-wisdom%40yahoogroups.com&gt;, Ajit\n&gt; &gt; Kris=\r\nhnan\n&gt; &gt; &lt;ajit.krishnan@&gt; wrote:\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; namaste,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Maybe I&#39;m=\r\n deluding myself, but I see a strong similarity between\n&gt; &gt; this mantra\n&gt; &gt;=\r\n &gt; and the savitur gayatri. The words in the first half of this\n&gt; &gt; mantra,=\r\n and the\n&gt; &gt; &gt; first two padas of the gayatri have a strong correspondence.=\r\n It is\n&gt; &gt; certainly\n&gt; &gt; &gt; a potent mantra which will provide true spiritua=\r\nl upliftment.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; Here is a translation based on the commentary of =\r\nthe Rishi\n&gt; &gt; Shaunaka -- We\n&gt; &gt; &gt; pray to the eye of all three. (i.e. sadA=\r\nshiva, who is the\n&gt; &gt; progenitor of\n&gt; &gt; &gt; brahma, vishnu and rudra). He has=\r\n the sweet fragrance (earned by\n&gt; &gt; the punya\n&gt; &gt; &gt; of his good works). He =\r\nnourishes us (by providing us with the\n&gt; &gt; shakti that\n&gt; &gt; &gt; underlies the =\r\nentire cosmic creation). (Through his grace,) we are\n&gt; &gt; liberated\n&gt; &gt; &gt; fr=\r\nom death (i.e. samsara, the cycle of life and death) and are\n&gt; &gt; lead to\n&gt; =\r\n&gt; &gt; (sAyujya) mokSha, just as the cucumber detaches itself from its\n&gt; &gt; pla=\r\nnt.\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; bhavadIyaH,\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt; ajit\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;\n&gt; &gt;  \n&gt; &gt;\n&gt;\n\n\n=\r\n\n"}}
